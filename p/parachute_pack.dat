25|$|<b>Parachute</b> <b>pack</b> systems – The {{parachute}} {{is one of}} the trademarks of Force Recon, {{throughout its}} existence the operators have extensively used a wide variety of parachutes. In the mid-1950s, they used the T-10, then later adopting the Capewell canopy release which provided a cut-away to reduce the deadly effect of drag. The T-10 became the most frequented parachute; which had two variants, one for low-level static line (LLSL) and the other for military free fall (MFF) descends. They had numerous parachutes listed under the Table of Equipment (T/E) that had been contained in the Paraloft. Even in its formative days in the Marine Corps Test Unit#1, the operators and testers of the Naval Parachute Unit (NPU) at El Centro had tested and sported numerous parachutes, adding modifications and suggestions that soon were adopted by other parachutists. By the 1990s, the MC-4 and MC-5 Ram Air Parachutes became the feasible choice, as it allows more detailed and accurate landing in smaller areas, easy to control—especially during oscillation of the canopy. Plus, it was formed to modulate between the LLSL and MFF without having to consort to a different pack.|$|E

500|$|The early scene {{involving}} Bond and Jaws {{in which}} Bond is {{pushed out of}} the aircraft without a parachute took weeks of planning and preparation. The skydiving sequence was coordinated by Don Calvedt {{under the supervision of}} second unit director John Glen. As Calvedt and skydiving champion B.J. Worth developed the equipment for the scene, which included a [...] <b>parachute</b> <b>pack</b> that could be concealed beneath the suit to give the impression of the missing parachute, and equipment to prevent the freefalling cameraman from suffering whiplash while opening his parachute, they brought in stuntman Jake Lombard to test it all. Lombard eventually played Bond in the scene, with Worth as the pilot from which Bond takes a parachute, and Ron Luginbill as Jaws. Both Lombard and Worth would become regular members of the stunt team for aerial sequences in later Bond films. When the stuntmen opened their parachutes {{at the end of every}} shoot, custom-sewn velcro costume seams would separate to allow the hidden parachutes to open. The skydiver cinematographer used a lightweight Panavision experimental plastic anamorphic lens, bought from an old pawn shop in Paris, which he had adapted, and attached to his helmet to shoot the entire sequence. The scene took a total of 88 skydives by the stuntmen to be completed. The only scenes shot in studio were close-ups of Roger Moore and Richard Kiel.|$|E

2500|$|On 14 May 1940 Carey flew {{his last}} patrol in the campaign. While leading {{a section of}} Hurricanes over the front, Carey spotted a lone Westland Lysander and flew down to it to show the pilot they were {{friendly}} fighters. As he did so he noted a Do 17 some 3,000ft above. Carey climbed, attacked and hit the Dornier which half-rolled, dived and then crashed. As Carey pursued it down the German gunner hit his Hurricane with several bursts and the fighter caught fire. One round {{hit him in the}} knee and another had passed between his legs and hit the <b>parachute</b> <b>pack.</b> Regardless, Carey quickly decided to bale out. The parachute snagged on the cockpit [...] "hood" [...] and because of the slipstream and he had difficulty in moving his good leg out of the cockpit. The delay enabled Carey to stay with the aircraft long enough to notice the dive had put out the fire and Carey opted for a crash-landing instead. Carey abandoned the Hurricane in a field, but took maps and identification documents with him fearing he might be in enemy territory. He elected not to destroy the Hurricane. Carey landed near Hamme, Belgium, and was picked up by a Belgian Army patrol. The German aircraft had also crashed nearby and its occupants were taken prisoner. From 14–20 May, in Carey's absence, 3 Squadron lost four killed, one captured and one badly wounded. Aside from the six losses, four Hurricanes force-landed and another two were damaged.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} {{and testing of}} the Orion crew capsule parachute system has provided {{a unique opportunity to}} study dense <b>parachute</b> <b>packing</b> techniques and limits, in order to establish a new baseline for future programs. The density of <b>parachute</b> <b>packs</b> has a significant influence on vibration loads, retention system stresses, and parachute mortar performance. Material compositions and pack densities of existing designs for space capsule recovery were compared, using the pack density of the Apollo main parachutes as the current baseline. The composition of parachutes has changed since Apollo, incorporating new materials such as Kevlar, Vectran, Teflon and Spectra. These materials have different specific densities than Nylon, so the densities of hybrid <b>parachute</b> <b>packs</b> cannot be directly compared to Nylon parachutes for determination of feasibility or volume allocation. Six <b>parachute</b> <b>packs</b> were evaluated in terms of weighted average solid density in order to achieve a non-dimensional comparison of packing density. Means of mitigating damage due to packing pressure and mortar firing were examined in light of the Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) and Apollo experience. Parachute design improvements including incorporation of modern materials and manufacturing processes serves to make CPAS the new knowledge base on which future spacecraft parachute systems will be built...|$|R

Kessler blended these visions with equal parts humor and tragedy in pieces such as The Last Birdrunner (1994), a kinetic sculpture based on the science fiction movie Blade Runner. Shown in a solo exhibition at the Luhring Augustine Gallery in New York in 1994, The Last Birdrunner consists of a stuffed bird outfitted in a <b>parachute</b> <b>pack</b> and perched on a ledge that slowly travels up and down while a motor-driven apparatus plays out a haunting dirge on a toy piano. Meanwhile, colored lights flicker in and out of focus against a geodesic dome in the background so that the scene takes on the appearance - though none of the care-free energy - of a Tokyo night club. The Last Birdrunner represents, according to Artforum critic Neville Wakefield, “the nemesis of … utopian dreams in the guise of a lonely cockatoo wearing a life vest.” ...|$|E
