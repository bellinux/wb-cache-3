In Bradford County, the worst of the flooding occurred in the western side of the county, especially in areas adjacent to Buck and Bentley creeks. At Wells Township, State Route 549 was washed out and flooding damaged 8 businesses and 17 homes. In Waverly, the basement of the Village Hall and annex building were both flooded, damaging village archives and <b>police</b> <b>equipment.</b> Throughout the county, about 30 roads, including U.S. Route 6 and state routes 14 and 4028, were closed because of high water or debris, while a bridge in Smithfield Township was washed out. A total of 35 people evacuated from their homes due to flooding. In Lycoming County, the Lycoming Creek crested at heights exceeding records set during Hurricane Agnes in 1972. Nearly all roads in the central and western portions of the county were shutdown due to water inundation. About 350 people evacuated or were rescued from their homes, 178 of whom took refuge at Red Cross shelters. A total of 75 homes and 80 trailers were severely damaged or destroyed.|$|E

Overt marked cars may have CCTV cameras mounted on the roof to discourage wrongdoing, whereas unmarked cars would have them hidden inside. This type of vehicle is particularly common in the United Kingdom. In the United States, some police departments' vice, narcotics, and gang suppression units utilize vehicles that contain no identifiable <b>police</b> <b>equipment</b> (such as lights, sirens or radios) to conduct covert surveillance.|$|E

50|$|In <b>policing</b> <b>equipment,</b> body worn video (abbreviated to BWV, {{and also}} known as a body camera, body-worn camera, or {{wearable}} camera) is a wearable audio, video, or photographic recording system used to record events in which police officers are involved. They are typically worn on the torso of the body.|$|R

25|$|From 1829, to 1839, Metropolitan Police {{officers}} wore blue swallow tail coats {{with high}} collars to counter garroting. This was worn with white trousers in summer, and a cane-reinforced top hat, {{which could be}} used as a step to climb or see over walls. The sleeves of the dark blue coats originally had a pattern of white bars, roughly 6mm wide by 50mm high, set roughly 6mm apart. This immediately distinguished them from naval or maritime personnel. In the early years of the Metropolitan <b>Police,</b> <b>equipment</b> was little more than a rattle to call for assistance, and a wooden truncheon. As the years progressed, the rattle was replaced with the whistle, swords were removed from service, and flintlock pistols were removed in favour of revolvers.|$|E
25|$|U.S. {{security}} sector assistance began publicly at {{the conclusion}} of the Oslo Accords, through aid to the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) for the Palestinian Police under the authority of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. While Arafat requested international donor assistance for his police force in early 1993, substantial coordination did not occur before the deployment of the Palestinian Police to Gaza and Jericho in 1994. According to Norwegian scholar Brynjar Lia, in his book Building Arafat's Police: The Politics of International Police Assistance in the Palestinian Territories after the Oslo Agreement, the international community, especially the European Union (EU) and the United States, was at odds regarding the appropriate means by which to facilitate donor aid to the newly established Palestinian Authority. Additionally, though concerns about inadequate <b>police</b> <b>equipment,</b> training, and resources were paramount to the PLO and Arafat, international actors did not emphasize this component of their overall efforts to support the Oslo agreements. Lia argues that this was predominantly because many donor countries already had covert bilateral security sector assistance programs unrelated to the new international donation structures, and also because the PLO did not successfully convey their requests to Western donors who lacked confidence that the PLO would coordinate security aid to donor satisfaction.|$|E

The video begins with scenes of police officers bringing a handcuffed Stan into a room of a police station to interrogate her along with two of her female friends. When {{she and her friends}} refuse to give the police any information, they lock them in a jail cell. Stan coaxes and successfully seduces the guard, while her friends steal his <b>police</b> <b>equipment</b> before locking him inside the cell and escaping. The group enters a dressing room where they find police outfits and disguise themselves as officers. They locate the chief's office and hold the police chief and other workers at gun point while duct-taping their mouths and hands to the chief's desk. Stan and her friends exit the office and walk inconspicuously through the front lobby and out of the building. Cut scenes show Stan dancing in her cell or her with her friends in police uniform.|$|E

To wear plainclothes is to wear civilian clothes, instead of wearing a uniform, to avoid detection or identification as a law enforcement officer. However, plainclothes police officers typically carry normal <b>police</b> <b>equipment</b> and normal identification. Police detectives are assigned to wear plainclothes by wearing suits instead of the uniform typically worn by their peers. Police officers in plainclothes must identify themselves when using their police powers; however, they are not required to identify themselves on demand and may lie about their status as a police officer.|$|E
