25|$|The flux of ions {{through the}} <b>potassium</b> <b>channel</b> pore is {{regulated}} by two related processes, termed gating and inactivation. Gating is the opening or {{closing of the}} channel in response to stimuli, while inactivation is the rapid cessation of current from an open <b>potassium</b> <b>channel</b> and {{the suppression of the}} channel's ability to resume conducting.

40|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>channels</b> are {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} class of ion channels. These channels are transmembrane proteins known to play important roles in both normal and pathophysiological functions in all cell types. Various <b>potassium</b> <b>channels</b> are recognised as potential therapeutic targets {{in the treatment of}} Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, brain/spinal cord ischaemia and sepsis. In addition to their importance as therapeutic targets, certain <b>potassium</b> <b>channels</b> are known for their beneficial roles in anaesthesia, cardioprotection and neuroprotection. Some types of <b>potassium</b> <b>channels</b> present in the plasma membrane of various cells have been found in the inner mitochondrial membrane as well. <b>Potassium</b> <b>channels</b> have been proposed to regulate mitochondrial membrane potential, respiration, matrix volume and Ca 2 + ion homeostasis. It has been proposed that mitochondrial <b>potassium</b> <b>channels</b> mediate ischaemic preconditioning in various tissues. However, the specificity of a pharmacological agents and the mechanisms underlying their effects on ischaemic preconditioning remain controversial. The following <b>potassium</b> <b>channels</b> from various tissues have been identified in the inner mitochondrial membrane: ATPregulate...|$|R
25|$|As with sodium <b>channels,</b> the <b>potassium</b> <b>channels</b> {{have their}} own toxins that block channel protein action. An {{example of such a}} toxin is the large cation, tetraethylammonium (TEA), but it is notable that the toxin does not have the same {{mechanism}} of action on all <b>potassium</b> <b>channels,</b> given the variety of channel types across species. The presence of <b>potassium</b> <b>channels</b> was first identified in Drosophila melanogaster mutant flies that shook uncontrollably upon anesthesia due to problems in cellular repolarization that led to abnormal neuron and muscle electrophysiology. <b>Potassium</b> <b>channels</b> were first identified by manipulating molecular genetics (of the flies) instead of performing channel protein purification because there were no known high-affinity ligands for <b>potassium</b> <b>channels</b> (such as TEA) at the time of discovery.|$|R
25|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>channel</b> efflux is {{inhibited}} by magnesium. Thus hypomagnesemia {{results in}} an increased excretion of potassium in kidney, resulting in a hypokalaemia. This condition is believed to occur secondary to the decreased normal physiologic magnesium inhibition of the ROMK channels in the apical tubular membrane.|$|E
25|$|An {{increased}} intracellular ATP:ADP ratio {{closes the}} ATP-sensitive SUR1/Kir6.2 <b>potassium</b> <b>channel</b> (see sulfonylurea receptor). This prevents potassium ions (K+) from leaving the cell by facilitated diffusion, {{leading to a}} buildup of intracellular potassium ions. As a result, {{the inside of the}} cell becomes less negative with respect to the outside, leading to the depolarization of the cell surface membrane.|$|E
25|$|Voltage-gated {{potassium}} {{channels are}} {{another set of}} voltage-gated channels that {{play a significant role}} in the initiation of dendritic spikes. Voltage-gated potassium channels, similar to voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, facilitate the movement of cations across the plasma membrane. But unlike voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, the voltage-gated <b>potassium</b> <b>channel</b> moves cations out of the cell thereby having an inhibitory effect on dendritic spike initiation.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{types of}} <b>potassium</b> <b>channels</b> are {{activated}} by muscarinic receptors {{and these are}} called muscarinic <b>potassium</b> <b>channels</b> (IKACh). [...] These channels are a heterotetramer composed of two GIRK1 and two GIRK4 subunits. Examples are <b>potassium</b> <b>channels</b> in the heart, which, when activated by parasympathetic signals through M2 muscarinic receptors, cause an outward current of potassium, which slows down the heart rate.|$|R
50|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>channels</b> come in {{a variety}} of forms, are present in most {{eukaryotic}} cells, and typically tend to stabilize the cell membrane at the potassium equilibrium potential. As with sodium ions, graded potentials and action potentials are also dependent on <b>potassium</b> <b>channels.</b> While influx of Na+ ions into a neuron induce cellular depolarization, efflux of influx of K+ ions out of a neuron causes a cell to repolarize to resting membrane potential. The activation of <b>potassium</b> ion <b>channels</b> themselves are dependent on the depolarization resulting from Na+ influx during an action potential. As with sodium <b>channels,</b> the <b>potassium</b> <b>channels</b> have their own toxins that block channel protein action. An example of such a toxin is the large cation, tetraethylammonium (TEA), but it is notable that the toxin does not have the same mechanism of action on all <b>potassium</b> <b>channels,</b> given the variety of channel types across species.

25|$|Amitriptyline {{additionally}} {{acts as an}} antagonist or inverse agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors, the α1-adrenergic receptor, the histamine H1 and H2 receptors, and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and as an agonist of the sigma σ1 receptor. It {{has also}} been shown to be a relatively weak NMDA receptor antagonist via the dizocilpine (MK-801)/phencyclidine (PCP) site. Amitriptyline inhibits sodium channels, L-type calcium channels, and Kv1.1, Kv7.2, and Kv7.3 voltage-gated potassium channels, and therefore acts as a sodium, calcium, and <b>potassium</b> <b>channel</b> blocker as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{transient}} A-type voltage-gated <b>potassium</b> <b>channel</b> is {{a specific}} channel that {{plays a key role}} in dendritic spike initiation. The density of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels is similar in both dendrites and axons; however, the dendritic membrane is far less excitable than the axonal membrane. The difference in excitability can be attributed to the presence of these voltage-gated potassium channels. Voltage-gated potassium channels inhibit the ability of dendrites to generate action potentials and decrease the amplitude of dendritic spikes with increasing distance from the soma. The ability of voltage-gated potassium channels to modulate dendritic signaling may have significant effects on synaptic plasticity.|$|E
25|$|This protein {{belongs to}} the <b>potassium</b> <b>channel</b> KCNE family and is one five single transmembrane domain {{voltage-gated}} potassium (Kv) channel ancillary subunits. KCNE2 is composed of three major domains: the N-terminal domain, the transmembrane domain, and the C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain protrudes out of the extracellular side of the cell membrane and is, thus, soluble in the aqueous environment. Meanwhile, the transmembrane and C-terminal domains are lipid-soluble to enable the protein to incorporate into the cell membrane. The C-terminal faces the intracellular side of the membrane and may share a putative PKC phosphorylation site with other KCNE proteins.|$|E

30|$|Our {{results suggest}} that ROS are {{involved}} in the depolarization of synaptosomal plasma membrane. We have demonstrated previously that the decrease of potential in such case was induced by the inhibition of sodium pump and <b>potassium</b> <b>channels</b> (Fedorovich et al. 2003). Therefore, the free radical-induced damage of sodium pump and/or <b>potassium</b> <b>channels</b> in association with direct influence of protons on <b>potassium</b> <b>channels</b> may underlay the synaptosomal plasma membrane depolarization (Moody 1984).|$|R
5000|$|These {{channels}} {{differ from}} the <b>potassium</b> <b>channels</b> that are typically responsible for repolarizing a cell following an action potential, such as the delayed rectifier and A-type <b>potassium</b> <b>channels.</b> Those more [...] "typical" [...] <b>potassium</b> <b>channels</b> preferentially carry outward (rather than inward) potassium currents at depolarized membrane potentials, and may {{be thought of as}} [...] "outwardly rectifying." [...] When first discovered, inward rectification was named [...] "anomalous rectification" [...] to distinguish it from outward potassium currents.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} {{development}} of many organisms, the action potential is actually initially carried by calcium current rather than sodium current. The {{opening and closing}} kinetics of calcium channels during development are slower {{than those of the}} voltage-gated sodium channels that will carry the action potential in the mature neurons. The longer opening times for the calcium channels can lead to action potentials that are considerably slower than those of mature neurons. Xenopus neurons initially have action potentials that take 60–90 ms. During development, this time decreases to 1 ms. There are two reasons for this drastic decrease. First, the inward current becomes primarily carried by sodium channels. Second, the delayed rectifier, a <b>potassium</b> <b>channel</b> current, increases to 3.5 times its initial strength.|$|E
25|$|Homology {{models can}} also be used to {{identify}} subtle differences between related proteins that have not all been solved structurally. For example, the method was used to identify cation binding sites on the Na+/K+ ATPase and to propose hypotheses about different ATPases' binding affinity. Used in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations, homology models can also generate hypotheses about the kinetics and dynamics of a protein, as in studies of the ion selectivity of a <b>potassium</b> <b>channel.</b> Large-scale automated modeling of all identified protein-coding regions in a genome has been attempted for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, resulting in nearly 1000 quality models for proteins whose structures had not yet been determined at the time of the study, and identifying novel relationships between 236 yeast proteins and other previously solved structures.|$|E
25|$|In {{pancreatic}} β-cells, cAMP signaling, {{which can}} be activated by various extracellular stimuli including hormonal and neural inputs primarily through Gs-coupled receptors, is of importance for normal regulation of insulin secretion to maintain glucose homeostasis. Activation of cAMP signaling amplifies insulin secretion by Epac2-dependent as well as PKA-dependent pathways. Epac2-Rap1 signaling is critical to promote exocytosis of insulin-containing vesicles from the readily releasable pool. In Epac2-mediated exocytosis of insulin granules, Epac2 interacts with Rim2, which is a scaffold protein localized in both plasma membrane and insulin granules, and determines the docking and priming states of exocytosis. In addition, piccolo, a possible Ca2+ sensor protein, interacts with the Epac2-Rim2 complex to regulate cAMP-induced insulin secretion. It is suggested that phospholipase C-ε (PLC-ε), one of the effector proteins of Rap, regulates intracellular Ca2+ dynamics by altering the activities of ion channels such as ATP-sensitive <b>potassium</b> <b>channel,</b> ryanodine receptor, and IP3 receptor.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to study the {{influence}} of extracellular ATP (adenosine- 3 -phosphate), which is an activator of purinergic receptors, on contractive activity of rat aortic ring segments precontracted by α 1 -adrenoreceptors activation with phenylephrine and evaluate the impact of <b>potassium</b> <b>channels</b> of plasma membrane on mechanisms of ATP activity. Material and methods. Contractive activity of vascular smooth muscle cells was studied using the method of Organ Bath Myography applied to the thoracic aorta segments in male Wistar rats both with intact and removed endothelium.

25|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>potassium</b> <b>channel</b> selectivity remains under continued debate. The carbonyl oxygens are strongly electro-negative and cation-attractive. The filter can accommodate potassium ions at 4 sites usually labelled S1 to S4 {{starting at the}} extracellular side. In addition, one ion can bind in the cavity at a site called SC or one or more ions at the extracellular side at more or less well-defined sites called S0 or Sext. Several different occupancies of these sites are possible. Since the X-ray structures are averages over many molecules, it is, however, not possible to deduce the actual occupancies directly from such a structure. In general, there is some disadvantage due to electrostatic repulsion to have two neighboring sites occupied by ions. Proposals for the {{mechanism of}} selectivity have been made based on molecular dynamics simulations, toy models of ion binding, thermodynamic calculations, topological considerations, and structural differences between selective and non-selective channels.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation of {{the colon}} is a {{characteristic}} symptom of ulcerative colitis, and {{a new series of}} drugs in development looks to disrupt the inflammation process by selectively targeting an ion channel. A crucial step involved in the inflammation signaling cascade involves an intermediate conductance calcium activated <b>potassium</b> <b>channel</b> (IK channel) known as KCa3.1; a protein coded for in the human gene KCNN4. Ongoing research seeks to prevent T-cell activation and inflammation by inhibiting the KCa3.1 channel, selectively. Since there is an upregulation of IK channel activity during T cell activation, inhibition of the KCa3.1 is able to disrupt the production of Th1 cytokines IL-2 and TNF-∝. Production of these cytokines decreases because inhibition of KCa3.1 reduces the efflux of K+, which in turn diminishes the influx of Ca2+. By lowering elevated intracellular Ca2+ in patients with ulcerative colitis, these novel drug candidates can inhibit the signaling cascade involved in the inflammation process and help relieve many of the symptoms associated with ulcerative colitis.|$|E
25|$|Potassium {{voltage-gated}} channel subfamily E member 2 (KCNE2), {{also known}} as MinK-related peptide 1 (MiRP1), is a protein that in humans is encoded by the KCNE2 gene on chromosome 21.

Because of this {{and its ability to}} regulate multiple different ion channels, KCNE2 exerts considerable influence on a number of cell types and tissues. Human KCNE2 {{is a member of the}} five-strong family of human KCNE genes. KCNE proteins contain a single membrane-spanning region, extracellular N-terminal and intracellular C-terminal. KCNE proteins have been widely studied for their roles in the heart and in genetic predisposition to inherited cardiac arrhythmias. The KCNE2 gene also contains one of 27 SNPs associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease. More recently, roles for KCNE proteins in a variety of non-cardiac tissues have also been explored.|$|E
