50|$|Like most California cypress, it is a <b>pyrophyte,</b> heavily {{reliant on}} {{wildfire}} for its regeneration. Fire suppression {{policies of the}} past decades have severely limited reproduction of this fire dependent species. It is on the IUCN Red List as a endangered species.|$|E
50|$|It was {{originally}} described by Alexander von Gilli in 1973 {{to accommodate a}} single specimen of a suffruticose <b>pyrophyte</b> with ternate leaves. The type species was Multidentia verticillata - named after its verticillate leaves - but has been made synonym with Multidentia concrescens.|$|E
50|$|The soil on the {{southern}} slope consists of coarse sand and gravel. The poor water-retaining ability of this soil contributes to the dominance of drought-tolerant scrubs and <b>pyrophyte</b> plants. These xerophytes have shallow but extensive root network to rapidly absorb water from the soil.|$|E

5000|$|Orangery (opened 2004, 300 m², height 13 meters) - {{overwintering}} {{of plants}} from Mediterranean regions, conifers {{from the southern}} hemisphere, and <b>Pyrophytes</b> from Australia and South Africa.|$|R
25|$|This {{regional}} climate {{supports a}} chaparral and woodlands ecoregion that is further divided in three sub-regions where two are observed in San Diego–Tijuana. These are the coastal sage and chaparral and montane chaparral and woodlands ecoregions. In the montane region, fire serves a unique purpose {{as a medium}} of change, and while fire typically can threaten urban development, {{it is essential for}} the historically annual cleanse of the woodlands and reproduction of <b>pyrophytes.</b>|$|R
50|$|As a <b>pyrophyte,</b> {{this tree}} has a thick, {{insulating}} bark {{that makes it}} well adapted to forest fires. After a fire, many tree species regenerate from seeds (as, for example, the maritime pine) or resprout {{from the base of}} the tree (as, for example, the holm oak). The bark of the cork oak allows it to survive fires and then simply regrow branches to fill out the canopy. The quick regeneration of this oak makes it successful in the fire-adapted ecosystems of the Mediterranean biome.|$|E
5000|$|This {{grass is}} a <b>pyrophyte,</b> well adapted to habitat {{with an annual}} {{wildfire}} cycle. During the dry season it becomes very flammable. Wildfires in stands of native grasses are patchy and relatively limited. H. rufa forms dense monotypic stands of tall stems {{in the absence of}} grazing pressure, and these stands ignite easily, burn intensely, and spread fire into the surrounding forests. Not only does the grass make wildfire events more severe, but it increases in response to fire. Dry parts may be burned away, but living tissue near the ground is not harmed and resprouts immediately; fire damage to an established stand of the grass is [...] "negligible".|$|E
50|$|Fire, {{both natural}} and human-caused, has played {{a large role in}} shaping the ecology of Mediterranean ecoregions. The hot, dry summers make much of the region prone to fires, and lightning-caused fires occur with some frequency. Many of the plants are pyrophytes, or fire-loving, adapted or even {{depending}} on fire for reproduction, recycling of nutrients, and the removal of dead or senescent vegetation. In both the Australian and Californian Mediterranean-climate eco-regions, native peoples used fire extensively to clear brush and trees, making way for the grasses and herbaceous vegetation that supported game animals and useful plants. The plant communities in these areas adapted to the frequent human-caused fires, and <b>pyrophyte</b> species grew more common and more fire-loving, while plants that were poorly adapted to fire retreated. After European colonization of these regions, fires were suppressed, which has caused some unintended consequences in these ecoregions; fuel builds up, so that when fires do come they are much more devastating, and some species dependent on fire for their reproduction are now threatened. The European shrublands have also been shaped by anthropogenic fire, historically associated with transhumance herding of sheep and goats.|$|E
5000|$|Fire acts favorably {{for some}} species. [...] "Passive pyrophytes" [...] resist {{the effects of}} fire, {{particularly}} when it passes over quickly, and hence can out-compete less resistant plants, which are damaged. [...] "Active pyrophytes" [...] have a similar competing advantage to passive <b>pyrophytes,</b> but they also contain volatile oils and hence encourage the incidence of fires which are beneficial to them. [...] "Pyrophile" [...] plants are plants which require fire in order to complete their cycle of reproduction.|$|R
3000|$|... b). Frequent fires should favor <b>pyrophytes</b> while {{infrequent}} fires or fire exclusion should favor mesophytes (Platt and Schwartz 1990, Kane et al. 2008, Nowacki and Abrams 2008, Beckage et al. 2009, Mola et al. 2014). Indeed, {{our analyses}} suggest that tradeoffs (negative correlations) between flammability and protective traits and acquisitive physiological traits, {{as well as}} suites of positively correlated flammability and protective traits (Figure 3) underlie observed suites of adapted traits and habitat preferences in oaks (Hiers et al. 2014).|$|R
30|$|For {{a fuller}} {{understanding}} of how oak functional traits influence ecosystem flammability and tree community composition, we must consider not just the trees themselves but also their relationships with the characteristic herbaceous understories of savannas and woodlands (e.g., Scholes and Archer 1997, Engber et al. 2011). Fires in savannas and woodlands are fueled by a mixture of flammable grasses and forbs {{and to a lesser}} extent by scattered tree litter and scant woody fuels (Engber et al. 2011). The variation in individual species effects on surrounding herbaceous fuels is not well understood, although it is known that southeastern USA species of the same stature allow different quantities and qualities of light to reach the forest floor (Battaglia et al. 2003, Pecot et al. 2007). The relationships we presented between canopy duration and the suites of physiological, protective, and flammability traits suggest that <b>pyrophytes</b> may promote ecosystem flammability not only by producing flammable litter, but through the indirect effects on herbaceous fuel productivity (Hoffmann et al. 2012). Indeed, field studies suggest that, compared to mesophytic oaks, <b>pyrophytes</b> in the southeastern USA are better able to coexist with flammable C 4 grasses, thereby promoting ecosystem flammability, limiting the abundance of fire-sensitive tree species, and maintaining high-light environments (Veldman et al. 2013). The mechanisms by which <b>pyrophytes</b> coexist with herbaceous plant communities remains unclear, but likely involve many of the functional traits considered in this study, including long canopy duration (i.e., low understory light penetration) and highly flammable litter (Figure 3; e.g., Hiers et al. 2007, Kane et al. 2008). Still, we need to know more about the relationships between canopy light transmittance (Battaglia et al. 2003, Engber et al. 2011), understory competition (Harrington 2011, Veldman et al. 2013), and vegetation-fire feedbacks (Beckage et al. 2009, Mitchell et al. 2009, Fill et al. 2015) to fully understand how oak fire survival strategies relate to the long-term functioning of these ecosystems.|$|R
3000|$|Beyond these <b>pyrophyte</b> or {{mesophyte}} groupings, other oaks {{survive in}} fire-prone environments via alternative strategies. This third group we term avoiders (sensu Rowe 1983), which persist by casting non-flammable litter (via their retention of moisture or via diminished fire intensity {{when they do}} ignite) and by casting evergreen shade and deep litter that further diminish herbaceous fuels in localized patches (Hiers et al. 2007, Kane et al. 2008, Kreye et al. 2013). Cumulatively, these changes in local fuels diminish or extinguish fires {{in close proximity to}} individual trees or small clumps. The classical examples of this protective strategy are oak “domes” of Q. geminata that persist within frequently burned Southeastern pine-oak savannas (Figure 1; Guerin 1993), and the lake-margin Q. virginiana forests that intermix with frequently burned uplands (Cavender-Bares et al. 2004 [...]...|$|E
3000|$|Traits that confer {{advantages}} to oaks in fire-prone sites represent the <b>pyrophyte</b> model (Hiers et al. 2014). Pyrophytes {{in our analysis}} possessed protective traits such as rapid juvenile bark accumulation (Jackson et al. 1999, Graves et al. 2014, Hammond et al. 2015) and rapid wound closure (Romero et al. 2009). Traits that promote flammability may enable pyrophytic oaks to increase local fire intensity while also injuring neighboring invaders that lack protective bark and wounding responses (Bond and Midgley 1995, Kane et al. 2008, Gagnon et al. 2010). The pyrophytes that invest in protective and flammability traits apparently do so through tradeoffs in growth rates (Table 3, Figure 2) as has been observed in other Southeastern savanna-woodland trees (Hammond et al. 2015). Southeastern pyrophytes that use these strategies include Q. laevis, Q. margaretta, Q. falcata, and Q. incana. Although we lacked complete data for Q. marilandica Münchh., Q. stellata Wangenh., and Q. alba L., their flammability and protective traits (Hammond et al. 2015, Varner et al. 2015 [...]...|$|E
40|$|Quercus suber L. is {{a species}} {{confined}} to the centre and western Mediterranean basin. On the island of Sardinia its distribution is limited mainly by soils. Apart from its economic significance to local communities, cork oak habitats are recognised as having both cultural and biodiversity value at a European level.

Among the problems that affect cork oak habitats on the island are soil erosion and loss of organic matter due to ploughing and seeding for pasture. Stock numbers have increased while grazing cattle {{have been replaced by}} sheep and are proven to be particularly damaging especially to cork oak regeneration. Although the species is a passive <b>pyrophyte,</b> frequent fires render the trees susceptible to fungal and defoliator attacks and destroy the understory leading to soil degradation and erosion.

5000|$|In a {{vegetation}} type classified as [...] "tapia forest" [...] in the Atlas of the Vegetation of Madagascar, tapia {{is the dominant}} and character species. This forest has a 10 - 12 m high canopy, with other trees including several Anacardiaceae, Asteraceae, Asteropeiaceae, Rubiaceae, and Sarcolaenaceae. Trees are <b>pyrophytes</b> with a thick, fire-resistant bark. The understory is composed of ericoid shrubs, grasses, and frequently lianas. Degraded tapia forest has a more open canopy and is less diverse, with Sarcolaena oblongifolia and Pentachlaena latifolia dominating alongside tapia.|$|R
30|$|An {{alternative}} fire {{strategy is}} typified by the mesophytic oaks, which {{enables them to}} invade formerly fire-prone sites and, where established, to resist invasion by <b>pyrophytes.</b> These species impede rather than promote fire, and also lack protective adaptations that would allow persistence following fire (Figure 2). In frequently burned landscapes, these species dominate in fire-protected refugia (Platt and Schwartz 1990, Ware et al. 1993, Mola et al. 2014); where they are present in pyric uplands, these species are uncommon, short-lived, or persist as resprouts (e.g., Grady and Hoffmann 2012). Where fires are excluded, their dominance increases, often resulting in changes to community flammability and drastic shifts in community composition and structure, {{all of which are}} characterized by the positive feedback phenomenon termed “mesophication” (Nowacki and Abrams 2008). In addition to the lack of flammability and protective traits, these species grow rapidly (Figure 2) and have long leaf lifespans. In the southeastern USA, mesophication begins when fire-sensitive species establish during fire-free intervals and proliferate as fire is further excluded (Gilliam and Platt 1999). The consequences of fire exclusion for pyrogenic communities can be severe, with dramatic reductions in plant and animal biodiversity (e.g., Engstrom et al. 1984, Ware et al. 1993, Gilliam and Platt 1999, Hiers et al. 2007), as well as novel outcomes for remnant pyrophytic species when fire is reintroduced (e.g., fire-caused death of normally fire-resistant trees; Varner et al. 2005). The mesophytic oaks in our dataset were Q. nigra and Q. hemisphaerica (as in Kane et al. 2008, Kreye et al. 2013). These mesophytic oaks cause functional changes to pine-oak savannas that are similar to the changes attributed to maples (Acer rubrum L. and A. saccharum Marshall) in fire-excluded Eastern deciduous forests (Nowacki and Abrams 2008, Stambaugh et al. 2015). These mesophytic oaks (but not <b>pyrophytes)</b> should be primary targets for removal in ecological restoration of pine-oak woodlands in the region, yet many managers mistakenly target all oaks, due to a failure to recognize the functional roles of <b>pyrophytes</b> (Hiers et al. 2014). Our results emphasize the fire-related strategies of the pyrophytic Southeastern oaks and should help clarify management that discriminates these species.|$|R
3000|$|... b). For oaks {{that are}} {{abundant}} in fire-prone pine-oak savannas and woodlands, the <b>pyrophytes,</b> {{there are clear}} advantages for traits that promote ecosystem flammability and protect stems from heating, despite reduced growth potential (Kane et al. 2008, Veldman et al. 2013). Oaks that lack fire protective and flammability traits, the mesophytic species, tend to co-dominate in forests (in contrast to savannas or woodlands) in which competition for light is acute and the probability of fires is reduced (Veldman et al. 2013). These mesophytic oaks have traits that confer rapid height growth, {{at the cost of}} developing traits that facilitate survival in frequently burned environments (Cavender-Bares et al. 2004 [...]...|$|R
30|$|Within {{these two}} large categories, {{analysis}} of raw mean data and DCA {{suggests that a}} group’s behavior varies between extremes of non-pyrophyte and <b>pyrophyte</b> types, but also according to seed bed depth influence and time of fire. Fire-sensitive groups range from major destruction of seeds irrespective of depth (groups A and C) to some emergence capacity if seeds are located deeper (B). On the other extreme lies the F group with large emergence (and low destruction rate) of near-surface seed beds. In general, the more fire sensitive a subgroup is, the more it can benefit from deeper positioning, for a given fire-time. Conversely, if the limit of destruction is not exceeded, seeders seem to respond in inverse fashion. In short, among {{each of the two}} groups, varying degrees of fire sensitivity or susceptibility correlated to taxonomy can still be found between each group’s extremes. As with DCA, if one focuses on modalities of fire and ash treatment using formal predictive models, we could conclude that depth and fire time seem to act as relevant environmental controls interacting with functional species groups’ sensitivity to fire.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{taxonomy}} of the hitherto monotypic, fynbos-endemic genus Glia Sond. is revised, {{together with a}} re-consideration of its generic circumscription. Recent field work has revealed and clarified the existence of two new species, herein described as G. decidua B-E. van Wyk and G. pilulosa B-E. van Wyk. Both are summer-deciduous geophytes (growing at low elevations in clay or limestone) that are clearly related to the well-known G. prolifera (an evergreen <b>pyrophyte</b> found in sandy soils, mostly at higher elevations). The genus Glia differs from the closely related Anginon Raf. in the geophytic habit with a single, tuberous root (woody shrubs or shrublets in Anginon), the predominantly unbranched flowering stems arising from a short woody collar above the tuber (stems usually much-branched above ground level in Anginon), with basal rosettes of leaves (mature leaves cauline and crowded towards the branch ends in Anginon) and with cauline leaves (if present) strongly reduced in size (not reduced in Anginon). Furthermore, the leaves are sparsely and minutely hairy, at least along the margins or veins below (totally glabrous in Anginon) and the petioles have medullary vascular bundles (absent in Anginon except in seedlings or juvenile leaves). Anginon species are evergreen shrubs or shrublets with persistent leaves borne on woody branches {{but some of them}} (e. g. A. verticillata) may lose their leaves under extreme drought conditions in summer...|$|E
40|$|The actual {{distribution}} {{and structure of}} cork oak woods {{is the result of}} a process of anthropogenic alteration (utilization of cork, deforestation, coppicing, overgrazing, changes in land use, fire). Additional causes of threats in Q suber woods are pests and fungal disease. Although cork oak is an active <b>pyrophyte</b> the decortication of trunks makes trees more vulnerable to external agents and to fire in particular. Post-fire species are mainly carbonicolous fungi, some Ascomycetes make their appearance after around six weeks while other fungi begin to appear from the second year. The proliferation of fungal hyphae in the ash, as well as of some pioneer mosse protonemata, promotes soil aggregation and storage of nutrients. Bryophyte phytocoenoses including species with rapid gametophyte development, spore germination favored by fire or high production of propagules. The association Funarietum hygrometricae is one of the first autotrophic plant communities that are already developing in the first year after the fire in numerous microsites within the forest areas. The dominant species is Funaria hygrometrica, one of the few mosses able to associate with mycorrhizal endophytes, that contribute to strengthen the tolerance (or sensitivity) of plants to passage of wildfire, but also influence the dynamics of regeneration of forest coenoses. Trees of genera Quercus, Pyrus, Fraxinus, Celtis and Arbutus express this dynamic together with some hemiparasites (Viscum, Loranthus) and epiphytes (Polypodium), shrubs (Calicotome, Chamaerops, Citysus, Cistus, Erica, Genista). Additional elements are species of the genera Asparagus, Daphne, Lavandula, Teucrium, Aira, Arisarum, Carex, Eryngium, Inula, Melica. Also parasitic plants (Limodorum, Cytinus), ferns (Asplenium), other bryophytes (Riccia, Bryum, Didymodon, Homalothecium), fungi (Amanita, Russula, Leccinum, Boletus) and lichens (Cladonia) characterize the post-fire forest coenoses in Sicily...|$|E

Variability of Chlorophyll a and inorganic nutrient concentration were determined during a year (November 2004 – October 2005) in five sampling stations. Primary and secondry production were determined during a year. Total chlorophyll a concentration during the investigation ranged between zero to 22. 8 μgl- 1 and the highest levels were consistently recorded during summer and the lowest during winter with a annual mean concentration 4. 48 μgl- 1. Nutrient concentration was seasonally related to river flow with annual mean concentration: NO 2 0. 05 ± 0. 2 mgl- 1, NO 3 1. 13 ± 0. 57 mgl- 1, NH 4 0. 51 ± 0. 66 mgl- 1, total phosphate 0. 13 ± 0. 1 mgl- 1 and SiO 2 5. 68 ± 1. 91 mgl- 1.

40|$|Aims: To {{assess the}} {{potential}} distribution of an obligate seeder and active <b>pyrophyte,</b> Cistus salviifolius, a vulnerable {{species in the}} Swiss Red List; to derive scenarios by changing the fire return interval; and to discuss the results from a conservation perspective. A more general aim is {{to assess the impact}} of fire as a natural factor influencing the vegetation of the southern slopes of the Alps. Locations: Alps, southern Switzerland. Methods: Presence-absence data to fit the model were obtained from the most recent field mapping of C. salviifolius. The quantitative environmental predictors used in this study include topographic, climatic and disturbance (fire) predictors. Models were fitted by logistic regression and evaluated by jackknife and bootstrap approaches. Changes in fire regime were simulated by increasing the time-return interval of fire (simulating longer periods without fire). Two scenarios were considered: no fire in the past 15 years; or in the past 35 years. Results: Rock cover, slope, topographic position, potential evapotranspiration and time elapsed since the last fire were selected in the final model. The Nagelkerke R- 2 of the model for C. salviifolius was 0. 57 and the Jackknife area under the curve evaluation was 0. 89. The bootstrap evaluation revealed model robustness. By increasing the return interval of fire by either up to 15 years, or 35 years, the modelled C. salviifolius population declined by 30 - 40 %, respectively. Main conclusions: Although fire plays a significant role, topography and rock cover appear to be the most important predictors, suggesting that the distribution of C. salviifolius in the southern Swiss Alps is closely related to the availability of supposedly competition-free sites, such as emerging bedrock, ridge locations or steep slopes. Fire is more likely to play a secondary role in allowing C. salviifolius to extend its occurrence temporarily, by increasing germination rates and reducing the competition from surrounding vegetation. To maintain a viable dormant seed bank for C. salviifolius, conservation managers should consider carrying out vegetation clearing and managing wild fire propagation to reduce competition and ensure sufficient recruitment for this species...|$|E
40|$|In Mediterranean ecosystems, {{wildfires}} are a {{key factor}} that affects vegetation and landscapes. In particular, recurrent wildfires are dramatically dangerous because they can compromise ecosystem resilience. In this view, the present work aimed to {{study the effects of}} fire events on the Mediterranean vegetation of Castellare Mount (Pisa). Castellare Mount seemed an interesting study place since two wildfires occurred in 2008 and 2009. The study area was divided into three sites: one site interested by the wildfire event occurred in 2009, another site interested by the wildfire event occurred in 2008, and a control site. Seven dominant plant species (Arbutus unedo L., Daphne gnidium L., Erica arborea L., Myrtus communis L., Phillyrea angustifolia L., Pinus pinaster Aiton and Quercus x morisii Borzì) were selected in each study site. For each species an index of flammability (IF) was calculated, following a non-destructive protocol that took into account seven functional traits related to leaves, twigs, canopy branching, standing litter, and volatile oils production. Moreover, a global flammability index was calculated for each study site. Results showed that all the plant species had quite high values of flammability, which could be explained by their adaptations to fire. In fact, all the taxa examined were active <b>pyrophytes,</b> whose regeneration are stimulated by fire events. However, vegetation survey highlighted a slower process of plant community recovery in the first year after the wildfire event than those observed in the subsequent years. In conclusion, recurrent wildfires are confirmed extremely dangerous because they compromise the recovery of Mediterranean vegetation...|$|R
50|$|Many of the Proteaceae have {{specialised}} proteoid roots, {{masses of}} lateral roots and hairs forming a radial absorptive surface, {{produced in the}} leaf litter layer during seasonal growth, and usually shrivelling {{at the end of}} the growth season. They are an adaptation to growth in poor, phosphorus-deficient soils, greatly increasing the plants' access to scarce water and nutrients by exuding carboxylates that mobilise previously unavailable phosphorus. They also increase the root's absorption surface, but this is a minor feature, as it also increases competition for nutrients against its own root clusters. However, this adaptation leaves them highly vulnerable to dieback caused by the Phytophthora cinnamomi water mould, and generally intolerant of fertilization. Due to these specialized proteoid roots, the Proteaceae are one of few flowering plant families that do not form symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. They exude large amounts of organic acids (citric acid and malic acid) every 2-3 days in order to aid the mobilization and absorption of phosphate. Many species are fire-adapted (<b>pyrophytes),</b> meaning they have strategies for surviving fires that sweep through their habitat. Some are resprouters, and have a thick rootstock buried in the ground that shoots up new stems after a fire, and others are reseeders, meaning the adult plants are killed by the fire, but disperse their seeds, which are stimulated by the smoke to take root and grow. The heat was previously thought to have stimulated growth, but the chemicals in the smoke have now been shown to cause it.|$|R
