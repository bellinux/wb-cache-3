2500|$|The first <b>palletizing</b> robot was {{introduced}} in 1963 by the Fuji Yusoki Kogyo Company. In 1973, a robot with six electromechanically driven axes was patented [...] by KUKA robotics in Germany, and the programmable universal manipulation arm was invented by Victor Scheinman in 1976, and the design was sold to Unimation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Palletizing</b> {{is one of}} {{the more}} popular {{applications}} for robots,and is accomplished by combining a series of commands into a <b>palletizing</b> routine. A RoboLogix <b>palletizing</b> routine consists of five program instructions, or lines. The first instruction is the Palletize instruction, which is followed by a linear motion instruction to move to the stack point. The stack point is the top-center of the workpiece, and a group of stack points forms a stacking pattern, as shown in the adjacent image. The first stack point in a stacking pattern is located at (1,1,1) (row,column, layer) and is incremented each time the <b>palletizing</b> routine is executed.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimitedOne of the Fast Combat Support Ship's (AOE) functions is {{the delivery of}} dry, freeze, and chill provisions to afloat combat units. The present ship characteristics do not provide for handling and stowage of <b>palletized</b> provision cargo. Significant savings in material handling time and cost can be realized from handling cargo in <b>palletized</b> units. A comparison is made between the present handling procedure on AOEs 1 and 2 and five alternative systems. Three of the alternatives will {{be shown to be}} infeasible because of the dimensions and physical constraints of the AOE hull. Comparison measures of effectiveness include total elapsed loading time, loading cost per measurement ton of cargo and qualitative considerations. In conclusion, recommendations for modification of the AOEs 1 and 2 to permit <b>palletized</b> handling of provisions cargo are prioritized. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
