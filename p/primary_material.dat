5|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>material</b> used {{to create}} the bricks for the castle was margosa {{limestone}} (a type of sedimentary rock composed of limestone and clay). The front of the castle is oriented to the east, {{and there was a}} ditch around the entire perimeter, including between the castle and the Plaza de Armas (Weapons Square). As of 2008 the building had lost its parapets and shelters, but the main defensive structures and walls have been preserved. The fort housed a garrison of 250 soldiers, and was the residence of the governor of the Province of Cumaná.|$|E
5|$|Victoria was {{physically}} unprepossessing—she was stout, dowdy {{and only about}} five feet tall—but she succeeded in projecting a grand image. She experienced unpopularity during {{the first years of}} her widowhood, but was well liked during the 1880s and 1890s, when she embodied the empire as a benevolent matriarchal figure. Only after the release of her diary and letters did the extent of her political influence become known to the wider public. Biographies of Victoria written before much of the <b>primary</b> <b>material</b> became available, such as Lytton Strachey's Queen Victoria of 1921, are now considered out of date. The biographies written by Elizabeth Longford and Cecil Woodham-Smith, in 1964 and 1972 respectively, are still widely admired. They, and others, conclude that as a person Victoria was emotional, obstinate, honest, and straight-talking.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the dozens}} of extant wasp families, only the family Vespidae {{contains}} social species, primarily in the subfamilies Vespinae and Polistinae. With their powerful stings and conspicuous warning coloration, often in black and yellow, social wasps are frequent models for Batesian mimicry by non-stinging insects, and are themselves involved in mutually beneficial Müllerian mimicry of other distasteful insects including bees and other wasps. All species of social wasps construct their nests using some form of plant fiber (mostly wood pulp) as the <b>primary</b> <b>material,</b> though this can be supplemented with mud, plant secretions (e.g., resin), and secretions from the wasps themselves; multiple fibrous brood cells are constructed, arranged in a honeycombed pattern, and often surrounded by a larger protective envelope. Wood fibers are gathered from weathered wood, softened by chewing and mixing with saliva. The placement of nests varies from group to group; yellow jackets such as D. media and D. sylvestris prefer to nest in trees and shrubs; P. exigua attaches its nests {{on the underside of}} leaves and branches; Polistes erythrocephalus chooses sites close to a water source. Other wasps, like A. multipicta and V. germanica, like to nest in cavities that include holes in the ground, spaces under homes, wall cavities or in lofts. While most species of wasps have nests with multiple combs, some species, such as Apoica flavissima, only have one comb. The length of the reproductive cycle depends on latitude; Polistes erythrocephalus, for example, has a much longer (up to 3 months longer) cycle in temperate regions.|$|E

These were more complex products for a labor structure driven by a densely populated craft guild environment. These characteristics were not as prevalent in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Because Penderecki {{understood}} timbre {{primarily as}} a function of the materials, the timbral categories in his sonorism are based upon the most common materials used in the assembly of instruments and accessories of traditional symphonic orchestras: metal, wood, leather, felt, and hair. Though any of these materials can act as both vibrators and inciters, felt and hair are the least effective vibrators due to the fact that they would be inaudible when vibrated. This then means that at least one of the two sound-generating bodies must be made of metal, wood, or leather, referred to as <b>primary</b> <b>materials.</b> In Penderecki’s timbre system, the three <b>primary</b> <b>materials</b> may (and do) interact with one another, whereas felt and hair can only interact with one of the <b>primary</b> <b>materials</b> and not themselves.|$|R

In this research project an estimation is made of the environmental implications when <b>primary</b> <b>materials</b> (natural materials) are replaced by secondary materials (waste materials) in road constructions and building materials. Moreover the results will be used in order to contribute to the normalization of the application of secondary materials. This report concerns the sampling and sample preparation of 21 secondary and 15 <b>primary</b> <b>materials.</b> The sampling and sample preparation were carried out by the Department of Inorganic Chemistry of the National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection (RIVM).

500|$|The nest {{is built}} in the {{understorey}} shrubs, relatively close to the ground. Nests have been recorded in prickly coprosma (Coprosma quadrifida), Cassinia, tea-trees (Melaleuca), eucalypts, and acacias, {{as well as in}} garden shrubs. The nest is a fragile, cup-shaped structure, swollen at the sides and narrower at the rim. The female builds the nest, but is often accompanied by the male as she gathers nesting material. Most nests are built of greenish material which varies with the location; in coastal areas grass is the <b>primary</b> <b>material,</b> while in mountain forests the nest is often covered with moss. One bird was recorded repeatedly flying between the nest and a koala [...] away and plucking the long hair near its ears to incorporate in the nest. The nests are very fine, with the eggs visible through the gauze-like walls, and they sometimes fall apart. They have been known to disintegrate with eggs and nestlings falling through the bottom.|$|E
500|$|The carpet (kilim) {{industry}} remains {{dominant in}} the town. Carpets have been crafted according to traditional designs, {{but in recent years}} {{it is up to the}} customers to decide the pattern of the carpet they have ordered. The production of a single [...] carpet takes about 50 days; primarily women engage in carpet weaving. Work is entirely manual and all used materials are natural; the <b>primary</b> <b>material</b> is wool, coloured using plant or mineral dyes. The local carpets have been prized at exhibitions in London, Paris, Liège and Brussels. The municipality has also invested in the development of tourism and many private houses have been turned into small family hotels or guesthouses. In 2004, 65 people were engaged in the tourism industry; in the same year, the municipality was visited by 2,350 tourists, of whom were 254 foreigners. In terms of economic indicators, the municipality ranks around the high average: it is 113th of 264 municipalities in Bulgaria by GDP per capita and 67th by Human Development Index.|$|E
