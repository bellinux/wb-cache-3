5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, {{after the end}} of the Second World War, Hergé was {{continuing}} to produce new instalments of The Adventures of Tintin for the Belgian magazine Tintin, of which he was the artistic director. After completing serialisation of Prisoners of the Sun in April 1949, he ordered his staff to re-serialise one of his old stories, Popol and Virginia, while he took a three-month break. At this point, Hergé was depressed and suffering from a range of physical ailments, including boils and eczema on his hands. Although fed up with The Adventures of Tintin, he felt great <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> to continue producing the series for Tintin magazine.|$|E
5|$|D'Oliveira {{was aware}} of the {{political}} discussions surrounding him during 1968, and the <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> was intensified by the scrutiny of his supporters and opponents in England and South Africa. Conscious of his failure in the West Indies, he made a concerted effort to improve his batting. He scored runs consistently and was chosen for England's first Test of 1968, against Australia in early June. He was very successful, scoring 87 not out and taking two wickets. After England lost, however, D'Oliveira was blamed in some sections of the press. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that he failed as a bowler, and his innings was difficult to evaluate as England had effectively lost the match by that stage. Even so, most observers expected him to retain his place, including the watching South Africans.|$|E
5|$|During the 2007 season, Lee {{failed to}} reach {{the final of the}} Malaysia Open {{for the first time in}} five years. He also {{suffered}} an early exit in five competitions afterward. Later on that season he took the Indonesia Open crown, his first title since the 2006 Malaysia Open after reuniting with former coach Misbun Sidek from Li Mao. His performance at the second half of the year was solid, as he achieved three titles in the Philippines Open, the Japan Open, and the French Open. He also managed to reach the final of the China Open and Hong Kong Open, despite his knee injury haunting him on both occasions. Lee won all matches he played in the Sudirman Cup in June, despite Malaysia finishing just fifth in the tournament. Lee's low point of the year was in the World Championships, despite the tournament being held in front of his home crowd and his solid performance during the second half of the year, he was defeated in the third round by Indonesia's Sony Dwi Kuncoro. Lee criticised the chief coach, Yap Kim Hock for treating him indifferently and putting <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> before the world championships. While the chief of Badminton Association of Malaysia, Datuk Nadzmi Mohd Salleh encouraged Lee and the chief coach, Yap Kim Hock to improve their relationship.|$|E

5|$|In 1974 Boycott's form dipped, when {{he scored}} only 75runs {{in the first}} innings of the season, other than a non-championship century against Cambridge University. He did, however, score 152* against Worcestershire on 15 May to {{complete}} his tour of centuries against every first-class county. Both he and Yorkshire suffered through 1975 and 1976, as did his international career, since he refused to play for England from 1974 until 1977. During the summer of 1978 Boycott broke a finger, so John Hampshire temporarily took over as captain. Boycott returned later in the season, scoring 968runs at 50.94, but this was second to Hampshire's 1,463 at 54.18. A poll of the dressing room showed that 95% of the players wanted a permanent change in the captaincy. On 15 September 1978 Boycott's mother, to whom he was very close, died of cancer, placing further <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>him.</b> On 29 September, the Yorkshire club committee met with Boycott to discuss terminating his captaincy. A statement by the club outlined Yorkshire's intention to retain Boycott as a player while giving the captaincy to Hampshire. Boycott, in response, attacked the Yorkshire club and its decision in an appearance on the BBC's flagship chatshow Parkinson on 7 October, prompting both strong criticism from the club and strong public support for his own position.|$|E
25|$|So {{they decided}} to upset our captain, Nick, by {{basically}} making the game one long physical fight. It worked...

25|$|Major {{concern was}} raised in England after a {{dramatic}} capitulation just 15 months after winning the coveted urn. As a result, many criticised Andrew Flintoff's captaincy and the resultant <b>pressure</b> placed <b>on</b> <b>him</b> in lieu of Michael Vaughan being injured.|$|R

Moss resents Williamson and agency owners Mitch and Murray for putting such <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> {{and plans to}} strike back at them by stealing all their best sales leads and selling them to a competitor. Moss sees Aaronow as a potential accomplice, but eventually convinces Levene {{to work with him}} in selling the leads to Jerry Graff, a local competitor. During his final rant against Roma, his indignation reveals that his jealousy extends towards even his fellow salesmen, and he decides to go to Wisconsin to avoid further questioning.|$|E
25|$|O'Keefe's tenure with Six O'Clock Rock {{ended in}} mid-1961, and in October {{he moved to}} ATN-7 as compere of the Johnny O'Keefe Show. The show was a major success, but this only added to his already hectic {{workload}} and increased the <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>him.</b> In August 1962 he suffered another breakdown and spent two months in the psychiatric ward at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, beginning {{what was to become}} a repeating cycle of much-publicised breakdowns, hospitalisation and recovery. During his convalescence the TV show was renamed Sing, Sing, Sing and he was temporarily replaced as host by folk singer Lionel Long.|$|E
25|$|Nadezhda von Meck {{saw things}} very differently. To her, filling {{the roles of}} mother, nurse, governess, dressmaker, housekeeper, and valet was far easier to bear than the humiliation of seeing her husband as a cog in the machine of a {{government}} organization. Neither did fulfilling all those domestic duties lower her resolve or weaken her energy in urging {{him to make a}} break. Russia, desperately short of railways, was expanding its communications network rapidly, and Nadezhda was far-sighted enough to see that a future for her husband lay there. She continually exerted <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> to find a partner with capital and to join the boom in Russian railway construction.|$|E

In 1964 he won the David Murray Landscape Award from the Royal Academy, and started a course at the Royal College of Art, but soon gave it up and took up manual work in mines and {{building}} sites. At the age of 21, he featured in a BBC TV documentary, The Quiet Rebel, in which he described his commitment to his art and the <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> to get a [...] "real job".

25|$|Prior to Árbenz's {{election}} in 1950, {{a handful of}} U.S. corporations controlled Guatemala's primary electrical utilities, the nation's only railroad, and the banana industry, which was Guatemala's chief agricultural export industry. By the mid-1940s, Guatemalan banana plantations {{accounted for more than}} one quarter of all of United Fruit Company's production in Latin America. Land reform was the centerpiece of Árbenz's election campaign. The revolutionary organizations that had helped put Árbenz in power put constant <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> {{to live up to his}} campaign promises regarding land reform. Árbenz continued Arévalo's reform agenda and in June 1952, his government enacted an agrarian reform program. Árbenz set land reform as his central goal, as only 2% of the population owned 70% of the land.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 Rosenblat and {{his wife}} had run into serious {{financial}} problems after the Rosenblat family were victims of an armed robbery that left his son, Kenneth Rosenblat, in a wheelchair and left Rosenblat critically injured. Rosenblat invented the story in the hospital while recovering. Rosenblat stated that his mother had appeared to him at the hospital and had told him to tell his story to the world. In 1994 Rosenblat had a tax lien placed on him by the IRS for unpaid payroll taxes dating back to 1988, which must have increased the financial <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>him.</b> According to Holocaust historian Kenneth Waltzer, Rosenblat changed his own story, replacing it with the love story, and then it must have become difficult to turn back. After he had won Oprah's contest of love stories he had to keep lying and live with it.|$|E

Gradually, they {{open up to}} each other and reveal their deepest personal secrets: Allison is a compulsive liar; Andrew cannot easily think for himself; Bender comes from an abusive household; Brian was planning suicide with a flare gun due to the inability to cope with a bad grade; and Claire is a virgin who feels constant pressure from her friends to be a certain way. They also discover that they all have strained relationships with their parents, which are a key cause for their personal issues as well: Allison's parents ignore her due to their own problems; Andrew's father constantly criticizes his efforts at wrestling and pushes him as hard as possible; Bender's father verbally and physically abuses him; Brian's overbearing parents put immense <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> to earn high grades; and Claire's parents use her to get back at each other during frequent arguments.

50|$|Michaels assured Gallagher and Brandon Tartikoff, NBC vice {{president}} for comedy programming, who was also present, that Franken would nevertheless comply with her request and tone the commentary down. Lorne suggested that they still might want to warn Silverman that the attack was coming, as the show had done in past seasons with the Belushi sketches. But whereas in those situations one of Michaels' assistants had called one of Silverman's, on a Saturday night {{the only way to}} warn Silverman would have been to call him at his own home and speak to him personally, which neither of them did. Michaels believed that both Gallagher and Tartikoff were afraid to talk to Silverman, who as the <b>pressures</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> increased with NBC's failures had been screaming at his subordinates more and more frequently.|$|R
25|$|For years, Watterson battled against {{pressure}} from publishers to merchandise his work, {{something that he}} felt would cheapen his comic. He refused to merchandise his creations {{on the grounds that}} displaying Calvin and Hobbes images on commercially sold mugs, stickers, and T-shirts would devalue the characters and their personalities. Watterson said that Universal kept putting <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> and said that he had signed his contract without fully perusing it because, as a new artist, he was happy to find a syndicate willing to give him a chance (two syndicates had denied Watterson). He added that the contract was so one-sided that, if Universal really wanted to, they could license his characters against his will, and could even fire him but continue Calvin and Hobbes with a new artist. Watterson's position eventually won out {{and he was able to}} renegotiate his contract so that he would receive all rights to his work, but later added that the licensing fight exhausted him and contributed to the need for a nine-month sabbatical in 1991.|$|E
25|$|Operation Nifty Package was an {{operation}} launched by Navy SEALs to prevent Noriega's escape. They sank Noriega's boat and destroyed his jet, {{at a cost}} of four killed and nine wounded. Military operations continued for several weeks, mainly against military units of the Panamanian army. Noriega remained at large for several days, but realizing he had few options {{in the face of a}} massive manhunt and a $1 million reward for his capture, he obtained refuge in the Vatican diplomatic mission in Panama City. The U.S. military's psychological <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> and diplomatic pressure on the Vatican mission, however, was relentless, as was the playing of loud rock-and-roll music day and night in a densely populated area. The report of the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff maintains that the music was used principally to prevent parabolic microphones from being used to eavesdrop on negotiations, and not as a psychological weapon based around Noriega's supposed loathing of rock music. Noriega finally surrendered to the U.S. military on 3 January 1990. He was immediately put on an MC-130E Combat Talon I aircraft and flown to the U.S.|$|E
25|$|From 1958 onwards, white settler {{politics}} consolidated and ossified {{around one}} issue – resistance to majority rule. The 1961 Constitution governed Southern Rhodesia, and later independent Rhodesia, up until 1969. It used the Westminster Parliamentary System modified {{by a system}} of separate voter rolls with differing property and education qualifications. The system ensured that whites had the majority of Assembly seats. In 1962 the Rhodesia Front Party (RF) won the elections {{under the leadership of}} Winston Field. It soundly rejected an accommodationist solution and sharpened racial polarisation. The black majority hoped that the British government would end white minority rule. Against this background the government wanted to pursue independence to forestall black majority rule. Field's Cabinet colleagues, considered him too weak to give Britain an ultimatum on independence and put <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> to go. He resigned in April 1964 and was succeeded by Ian Smith, an ardent advocate of unconditional independence. In the 1965 general election, Smith received his mandate to pursue independence vigorously and if necessary illegally and unilaterally. The Rhodesian Front swept 79.3 percent of the vote (up from 56.5 percent in 1962), and its victory confirmed that the old UFP—now the Rhodesia party—was a spent force.|$|E

25|$|The flanker's role is {{to tackle}} the {{opposition}} and try to steal the ball. The openside flanker binds {{to the side of}} the scrum that covers the greatest area, while the blindside covers the side nearest the side-line. They bind loosely {{to the side of the}} scrum, but still play an important role in keeping the props tight by pushing at an angle. They should be the first forward to a breakdown from a scrum or line-out and are expected to link with the backline or secure the ball at the tackle. Both positions have a high workrate, meaning the players need to be fit, fast and good at reading the opposition's attacking plays. During open play if they have not made the tackle they usually stand in the loose next to the ruck or maul. This allows them to arrive quickly at the next tackle. The blindside is generally the larger of the two and usually acts as a third jumping option at the line-out. The openside flanker is usually faster than the blindside, with good opensides excellent at turning over the ball at the tackle. Teams often use their openside flankers to 'charge' the opposition fly-half, putting <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> and forcing him to rush his decision making, kicking or passing. Blindside flankers also have the task of stopping any attempt by the opposition eighth-man to run with the ball around the blindside of a scrum.|$|E
