5|$|Madagascar {{is one of}} the <b>poorest</b> <b>countries</b> in the world, with a high {{population}} growth rate of 2.5%per year and nearly 70% of the population living in poverty. The country is also burdened with high levels of debt and limited resources. These socioeconomic issues have complicated conservation efforts, even though the island of Madagascar has been recognized by IUCN/SSC as a critical primate region for over 20years. Due to its relatively small land area—587,045km2 (226,659sq mi)—compared to other high-priority biodiversity regions and its high levels of endemism, the country {{is considered one of the}} world's most important biodiversity hotspots, with lemur conservation being a high priority. Despite the added emphasis for conservation, there is no indication that the extinctions that began with the arrival of humans have come to an end.|$|E
5|$|On the {{national}} level, sanctions and suspension of donor aid amounting to 50 percent of {{the national}} budget and 70 percent of public investments obstructed the Rajoelina administration's management of state affairs and its ability to systematically combat poverty on a wider scale. A United Nations envoy concluded in 2011 that Rajoelina's controversial accession to the presidency had reduced food security, with Madagascar ranking among the worst in the world for child nutrition. The frequent non-payment of civil servant and military salaries resulted in regular school and hospital closures, general strikes and widespread increases in corruption. Crime and insecurity grew dramatically, with a sharp upswing in violent crime and theft in Antananarivo and increasingly frequent and deadly incidences of armed cattle rustling in the central southern region of the island. Key development indicators steeply declined between 2009 and 2013, including maternal and child mortality, education enrollment and completion, per capita income and employment rates. In 2010 the United Nations ranked Madagascar among the ten <b>poorest</b> <b>countries</b> in the world, noting that economic gains made under Ravalomanana had been lost following Rajoelina's unconstitutional rise to power. In 2011, Forbes magazine ranked Madagascar as the worst economy in the world, faulting its political instability and poor governance.|$|E

50|$|The Bhagwati-Kravis-Lipsey view {{provides}} {{a somewhat different}} explanation from the Balassa-Samuelson theory. This view states that price levels for nontradables are lower in <b>poorer</b> <b>countries</b> because of differences in endowment of labor and capital, not because of lower levels of productivity. <b>Poor</b> <b>countries</b> have more labor relative to capital, so marginal productivity of labor is greater in rich <b>countries</b> than in <b>poor</b> <b>countries.</b> Nontradables tend to be labor-intensive; therefore, because labor is less expensive in <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> and is used mostly for nontradables, nontradables are cheaper in <b>poor</b> <b>countries.</b> Wages are high in rich countries, so nontradables are relatively more expensive.|$|R

30|$|Going {{back to the}} {{individual}} data, when splitting {{the individual}} data by rich and <b>poor</b> <b>countries,</b> {{we also found that}} individual desire to emigrate is more sensitive to SWB in rich <b>countries</b> than in <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> (Figure  1 A and Models 4 – 9 in Table  2). This is consistent with the earlier result when estimating Equation (1) separately for each country in Figure  3 A, that SWB is not significantly associated with migration desire in some <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> – although 87.0 % of <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> have negative relationship between migration desire and SWB, only 55.1 % of <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> have a significant and negative relationship (at the 5 % significance level). Interestingly, another result from the cross-country analysis – <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> have a stronger effect of GDP per capita on national average desire to emigrate – could not be replicated when individual data is analyzed. Instead, we found that household income has a less significant relationship with the desire to emigrate in <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> than in rich countries (Table  2). One explanation might be that some rich people in <b>poor</b> <b>countries,</b> unsatisfied that they are staying in a poor society, desire to emigrate as much as poor people. On the other hand, poor people in <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> might be trapped in places where they have insufficient resources to move (Foresight 2011), which may even diminish their migration desires. Besides, a survey conducted in <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> might yield less accurate income data. These factors may weaken the effect of household income on the desire to emigrate in <b>poor</b> <b>countries.</b> When the country-level data are used, since there is no within-country variation, we are able to identify a strong effect of income on the national migration desire for <b>poor</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{positive}} correlation between PPP investment rates and PPP income levels across countries {{is one of the}} most robust findings of the empirical growth literature.

We find that the high relative price of investment in <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> is solely due to the low price of consumption goods in <b>poor</b> <b>countries.</b> Investment prices are no higher in <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> than in rich countries. These facts suggest that the low PPP investment rates in <b>poor</b> <b>countries</b> are not due to low savings rates or to high tax or tariff rates on investment. <b>Poor</b> <b>countries</b> instead appear to be plagued by low efficiency in producing investment goods and in producing exportables to trade for machinery and equipment. ...|$|R
