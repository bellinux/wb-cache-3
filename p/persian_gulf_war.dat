5|$|After World War II ended, the U.S. Navy {{entered the}} 45 year long Cold War {{and participated in}} the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the First <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>War,</b> and the Second <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>War</b> / Iraq War. Following the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in 1990-91, the Soviet Red Navy fell apart, which made the United States the world's undisputed naval superpower. Nuclear power and ballistic missile technology led to new ship propulsion and weapon systems, which were used in the s and s. By 1978, the number of ships had dwindled to less than 400, many of which were from World War II, which prompted Ronald Reagan to institute a program for a modern, 600-ship Navy. Today, the United States is the world's undisputed naval superpower, with the ability to engage and project power in two simultaneous limited wars along separate fronts.|$|E

5|$|A {{supply of}} 929 M249 SAWs was issued to {{personnel}} from the U.S. Army and Marine Corps during the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>War.</b> Although exposure to combat was scarce, M249 gunners {{who were involved}} in fighting mainly used their weapons to provide cover fire for friendly maneuvering troops from fixed positions, rather than maneuvering with them. There were many complaints about the weapons clogging up with sand after prolonged use in the desert environment.|$|E
5|$|After its {{deployment}} in the Korean War, {{the division}} {{was active in}} Europe and the United States during the Cold War, but saw relatively little combat until the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>War,</b> when it faced the Iraqi military. A few years after that conflict, it was inactivated {{as part of the}} post-Cold War U.S. military drawdown of the 1990s. The division was reactivated in October 1999 as a formation for training and deploying U.S. Army National Guard units before its deactivation in October 2006.|$|E
5|$|First {{activated}} as a {{customs unit}} in post-World War II Germany, the brigade {{has a long}} history with United States Army Europe. Its duties as a customs unit meant that the unit was garrisoned in Germany for over forty years from 1950 until 1990, never seeing action in the American operations in the Korean War, Vietnam War, or the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>War.</b> It was deactivated during the post-Cold War drawdown of the U.S. military.|$|E

While Josepho thinks of them as guardian angels, they are revealed to be the almost-indestructible Super Soldiers. In the present, Josepho stands above the wreckage of a spacecraft in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Super Bowl XXV {{took place}} amidst a {{background}} of war and patriotism. The <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>War</b> had begun {{less than two weeks}} previous, and the nation rallied around the Super Bowl as a symbol of America. The Giants got off to a quick 3â€“0 lead; however, the Bills scored the next 12 points. The Giants responded by running a nearly eight-minute drive, which culminated in a 14-yard touchdown pass from Hostetler to Stephen Baker.|$|E

Its heritage thus includes the Second World War, the Vietnam War, and the Cold War, {{as well as}} the first and the second <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>wars,</b> encompassing a total of 34 deployments to the Western Pacific Ocean and <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{practice}} of long-distance radio listening {{began in the}} 1920s when shortwave broadcasters were first established in the US and Europe. Audiences discovered that international programming was available on the shortwave bands of many consumer radio receivers, {{and a number of}} magazines and listener clubs catering to the practice arose as a result. Shortwave listening was especially popular during times of international conflict such as World War II, the Korean War and the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>War.</b>|$|E
5|$|On August 1, 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein {{sent the}} invading Iraqi forces into {{neighboring}} Kuwait, a small petroleum-rich state long claimed by Iraq {{as part of}} its territory. This invasion sparked the initiation of the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>War</b> and it brought worldwide condemnation. An estimated 140,000 Iraqi troops quickly took control of Kuwait City and moved on to the Saudi Arabia/Kuwait border. The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia by the U.S. Central Command, headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf, because of its important petroleum reserves.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Uncle Tupelo's signing, Giant Records {{changed its}} name to Rockville Records. The band's first album for Rockville No Depression, was {{recorded}} over ten days in January 1990, at Fort Apache South recording studio in Boston, Massachusetts. The album's thematic structure revolved around their lives as adolescents in Belleville; examples are songs about wanting to avoid factory work and songs about fearing a potential <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>War</b> military draft. Impressed by their previous work on Dinosaur Jr.'s Bug, the band wanted Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade to produce the album. Slade let Farrar play on the same 1961 Gibson Les Paul SG Junior that J. Mascis originally played on Bug. The album was released on June 21, 1990, and the band celebrated by playing at Cicero's for two nights.|$|E

Since then, it has been exported to more than 30 countries and is certified on 25 aircraft. The Maverick served during the Vietnam, Yom Kippur, Iran-Iraq, and <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>Wars,</b> along with other smaller conflicts, destroying enemy forces and installations {{with varying degrees of}} success.|$|R
50|$|From 1978 until 1983, Bergman was a producer, {{reporter}} and then executive {{in charge of}} investigative reporting at ABC News. He {{was one of the}} original producers of 20/20. In 1983, Bergman joined CBS News as a producer for the weekly newsmagazine 60 Minutes, where over the course of 14 years he produced more than 50 stories, ranging from organized crime, international arms dealing and drug trafficking to the Iran-Iraq and <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>wars.</b> He also produced the first U.S. television interviews with Lebanon's Hezbollah leadership.|$|R
5|$|The 5-inch/38 gun {{would remain}} on the battleships for the ships' entire service life; however, {{the total number of}} guns and gun mounts was reduced from 20 guns in ten mounts to 12 guns in six mounts during the 1980s' {{modernization}} of the four Iowas. The removal of four of the gun mounts was required for the battleships to be outfitted with the armored box launchers needed to carry and fire Tomahawk missiles. At the time of the 1991 <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>War,</b> these guns had been largely relegated to littoral defense for the battleships. Since each battleship carried a small detachment of Marines aboard, the Marines would man one of the 5-inch gun mounts.|$|E
5|$|At {{the launch}} of the Iraq War dozens of 12-member Special Forces teams {{infiltrated}} southern and western Iraq to hunt for Scud missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of Navy SEALs seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast. Air Force combat controllers flew combat missions in MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It {{was a far cry from}} the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>war</b> of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. But it would not be a replay of Afghanistan, where Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders. From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and Al-Qaeda terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training the Iraqi security forces.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{investment}} in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity, but {{in large part by}} the interests of massive party and state bureaucracies dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges. The Soviet Armed Forces became the largest in {{the world in terms of}} the numbers and types of weapons they possessed, in the number of troops in their ranks, and in the sheer size of their militaryâ€“industrial base. However, the quantitative advantages held by the Soviet military often concealed areas where the Eastern Bloc dramatically lagged behind the West. For example, the <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>War</b> demonstrated how the armor, fire control systems and firing range of the Soviet's most common main battle tank, the T-72, were drastically inferior to the American M1 Abrams, yet the USSR fielded almost three times as many T-72's as the US deployed M1's.|$|E
