5|$|Similarly, the pyramid-like {{mountain}} of Rtanj, in the Serbian Carpathians, attracted much apocalyptic attention, as many believed an artificial pyramid structure buried within it would emit {{a powerful force}} shield on the day, protecting those within it. Hotels around the base received up to 500 bookings a <b>piece</b> <b>for</b> rooms.|$|E

5|$|The {{prolific}} {{opera and}} ballet composer Adolphe Adam composed the music. Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot created the choreography. The role of Giselle {{was intended for}} Carlotta Grisi as her debut <b>piece</b> <b>for</b> the Paris public. She became the first to dance the role and was the only ballerina to dance it at the Opéra for many years.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's qualities as {{a pianist}} and {{composer}} were recognized {{by many of}} his fellow musicians. Schumann named a <b>piece</b> <b>for</b> him in his suite Carnaval, and Chopin later dedicated his Ballade No. 2 in F major to Schumann. Elements of Chopin's music can be traced in many of Liszt's later works. Liszt later transcribed for piano six of Chopin's Polish songs. A less fraught friendship was with Alkan, with whom he discussed elements of folk music, and who was deeply affected by Chopin's death.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to their appearance in the film, Green Day recorded {{its own version of}} the Simpsons theme, and released it as a single. Zimmer turned the Spider-Pig song into a choral piece, which was a joke he never intended to be put into the film. Zimmer also had to write foreign-language lyrics for the 32 dubbed versions of the song when the film was released internationally. He found translating the song into Spanish the hardest to write. The same choir learned to sing the <b>piece</b> <b>for</b> each of the foreign-language dubs.|$|E
5|$|Offenbach's first <b>piece</b> <b>for</b> the company's {{new home}} was Ba-ta-clan (December 1855), a well-received piece of mock-oriental frivolity, to a {{libretto}} by Halévy. He followed it with 15 more one-act operettas {{over the next}} three years. They were all for the small casts permitted under his licence, although at the Salle Choiseul he was granted an increase from three to four singers.|$|E

5|$|Two {{drawings}} {{on paper}} in the British Museum and the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts were at times thought to be studies for the Munich Nativity. The lines of the folds in the garments closely match those of the painting, although the technical ability does not. The Paris drawing has blotches of paint indicating {{that it was a}} study <b>piece</b> <b>for</b> workshop members. The London piece is superior, but its lines are more rigid, lacking Lochner's fluidity, and so its attribution has been relegated to a draughtsman closely associated with Lochner.|$|E
5|$|When in 1952 Messiaen {{was asked}} to provide a test <b>piece</b> <b>for</b> flautists at the Paris Conservatoire, he {{composed}} the piece Le merle noir for flute and piano. While he had long been fascinated by birdsong, and birds had made appearances in several of his earlier works (for example La Nativité, Quatuor and Vingt regards), the flute piece was based entirely on {{the song of the}} blackbird.|$|E
5|$|Written by Barry Letts, the storyline {{for this}} four-part story was {{commissioned}} on 21 January 1975. It {{was based on}} an audition <b>piece</b> <b>for</b> the role of Sarah Jane Smith that Letts had written in 1973 and was initially known as Time Lord Story. Scripts were requested, but Hinchcliffe was unhappy with the draft of the first part and ultimately the story was dropped.|$|E

50|$|Since Europe, figurines {{based on}} actual units used in World War II {{are used in}} the game; the Nova Games edition {{included}} cardboard <b>pieces</b> <b>for</b> the units, while Classic only had unique <b>pieces</b> <b>for</b> infantry (with early sets having them in 1/76 scale as opposed to 1/72 scale found since Europe) and generic <b>pieces</b> <b>for</b> all other units.|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from his}} operas, Wagner {{composed}} relatively {{few pieces of}} music. These include a symphony in C major (written {{at the age of}} 19), the Faust Overture (the only completed part of an intended symphony on the subject), some overtures, and choral and piano pieces. His most commonly performed work that is not an extract from an opera is the Siegfried Idyll for chamber orchestra, which has several motifs in common with the Ring cycle. The Wesendonck Lieder are also often performed, either in the original piano version, or with orchestral accompaniment. More rarely performed are the American Centennial March (1876), and Das Liebesmahl der Apostel (The Love Feast of the Apostles), a <b>piece</b> <b>for</b> male choruses and orchestra composed in 1843 for the city of Dresden.|$|E
5|$|For Carlotta Grisi's {{performances}} as Giselle {{with the}} Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg, Perrot commissioned the composer Cesare Pugni {{to score a}} new pas de cinq for the ballerina that {{was added to the}} first tableau. This pas was only retained for Grisi's performances and never performed again after her departure from St. Petersburg. Marius Petipa would also commission an additional <b>piece</b> <b>for</b> the first tableau of the ballet. This was a pas de deux from the composer Ludwig Minkus that was added to the choreographer's 1884 revival for the ballerina Maria Gorshenkova. As with Pugni's 1850 pas de cinq for Grisi, Gorshenkova's 1884 pas de deux by Minkus never became part of the performance tradition of Giselle.|$|E

Bohumil Makovsky, Past Grand President and Chairman of the Board of Trustees, conducted his march, Kappa Kappa Psi, and F. Lee Bowling conducted J. DeForest Cline's Kappa Kappa Psi march. The 1947 NIB was recognized as the first-ever intercollegiate band assembled with a national scope in the United States. Since 1947, the fraternity has presented the F.

5|$|In 2002, Miller's discography {{as leader}} began to expand again, as Maxjazz started to release {{recordings}}. A series of four concert recordings were released {{over the following}} years: Live at The Kennedy Center Vol. 1 and Live at The Kennedy Center Vol. 2 (recorded in 2002), with Derrick Hodge (bass) and Rodney Green (drums); and Live at Yoshi's Vol. 1 and Live at Yoshi's Vol. 2 (recorded in 2003), with Hodge and Karriem Riggins (drums).

Brown, Miller and his band played the <b>piece</b> <b>for</b> performances by the company.|$|E
5|$|She is now {{best known}} as a fashion guru and style advisor. Her fashion career started when she worked for many years as a shop girl in America for Giorgio Armani. She later came back to London with the hope of {{securing}} a job with Armani but ended up working for designers such as Richard James, Patrick Cox, Alistair Blair and John Galliano which gained her an even greater understanding of fashion, providing an in depth knowledge of how a garment progresses from a sketch. She then started working with the British Brain and Spine Foundation and consequently met the sports editor of The Daily Telegraph. Whilst doing a <b>piece</b> <b>for</b> GMTV, he asked Constantine to report the women's World Cup Final in cricket on finding out that it was her passion. She proceeded to write about cars and then fashion.|$|E
