500|$|Whatever the privations, the St Kildans were {{fortunate}} in some respects, for their isolation spared them {{some of the}} evils of life elsewhere. Martin noted in 1697 that the citizens seemed [...] "happier than the generality of mankind as being almost the only <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>who</b> feel the sweetness of true liberty", and in the 19th century their health and well being was contrasted favourably with conditions elsewhere in the Hebrides. Theirs was not a utopian society; the islanders had ingenious wooden locks for their property, and financial penalties were exacted for misdemeanours. Nonetheless, no resident St Kildan {{is known to have}} fought in a war, and in four centuries of history, no serious crime committed by an islander was recorded there.|$|E

500|$|Band {{originally}} planned {{to produce a}} sequel called Laserblast II, with production work to begin in August 1986 and a theatrical release expected to follow shortly thereafter. A tagline released for the film read, [...] "The ultimate alien weapon is back." [...] When plans for the sequel were announced, Atlanta-based film critic Scott Journal wrote, [...] "I {{am one of the}} few <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>who</b> saw the original and, believe me, it did not merit a followup." [...] However, Charles Band Productions fell into financial difficulties shortly after the production of Laserblast, and the project was eventually scrapped. However, the premise and elements of the abandoned sequel were later used in the 1988 Charles Band film, Deadly Weapon, which, like Laserblast, was about a bullied teenager who finds a powerful weapon and uses it to seek revenge against his enemies. Band continued to make films and eventually formed Empire Pictures.|$|E
500|$|On 13 May 2002, [...] "Without You" [...] was {{released}} {{as the second}} single. It peaked at number eight in Australia, but dropped to number twenty-nine the following week, only spending five weeks on the chart. The song was first announced by Silverchair bass guitarist Chris Joannou in November 1999, when he told fans the band had [...] "a very small cache of recorded material stored away", including [...] "Without You". [...] "Without You" [...] was followed by [...] "Luv Your Life", which peaked at number twenty in Australia after its 20 September release. The inspiration for the song came to Johns during a therapy session, {{based on the idea}} that [...] "there were <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>who</b> needed treatment but couldn't afford therapy." [...] Johns composed most of the song's lyrics while listening to a therapist. In a performance at London's Shepherds Bush Empire, Johns jokingly said [...] "Luv Your Life" [...] was dedicated [...] "to all my ladies".|$|E
500|$|... "Creative evolution", Shaw's {{version of}} the new science of eugenics, became an {{increasing}} theme in his political writing after 1900. He introduced his theories in The Revolutionist's Handbook (1903), an appendix to Man and Superman, and developed them further during the 1920s in Back to Methuselah. A 1946 Life magazine article observed that Shaw had [...] "always tended to look at people more as a biologist than as an artist". By 1933, {{in the preface to}} On the Rocks, he was writing that [...] "if we desire a certain type of civilization and culture we must exterminate the sort of people who do not fit into it"; critical opinion is divided on whether this was intended as irony. In an article in the American magazine Liberty in September 1938, Shaw included the statement: [...] "There are many <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>who</b> ought to be liquidated". Many commentators assumed that such comments were intended as a joke, although in the worst possible taste. Otherwise, Life magazine concluded, [...] "this silliness can be classed with his more innocent bad guesses".|$|E

500|$|A {{factor of}} great {{conflict}} all over Eora is the recent scientific discovery that souls are not mere metaphysical abstractions, but quantifiable, measurable objects {{that can be}} transferred, stored, or molded. Souls are the basis of magic, as accessing their power is what allows certain people to use it. Souls leave the body upon death, and go through a largely unknown process before reincarnating into a newborn body. Every soul does, however, have embedded memories from their previous lives, and through certain processes a person's soul can be [...] "Awakened," [...] meaning they gain awareness of these past lives. There are also <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>who</b> have the supernatural ability to perceive people's souls, which allows them to access past memories, among other things; these individuals are called [...] "Watchers." [...] Though the study of souls, called animancy, is still a young field of science, the implications for society at large has been vast, led to rapid advances in technology, and caused several rifts and clashes in the different religious communities, which has marked the era as {{a time of great}} turmoil.|$|E
500|$|Townsend had {{asserted}} {{in chapter}} {{one that the}} cause of China's present misery lies in the fundamental defects that exist in the ethnic characteristics of the Chinese people and in chapters three and four he explains what he believes these defects are. Townsend states that dishonesty is [...] "the most prominent characteristic in the Chinese mentality as opposed to our own". Townsend gives many examples of him being lied to by Chinese employees, coolies, shopkeepers, and government officials, and notes that many other consuls were driven out of the service by this relentless and [...] "aimless lying, with each lie merely a pretext for another". The other highly salient trait of the Chinese is their [...] "indifference to fellow suffering". Through a large number of personal and second-hand anecdotes, Townsend argues that the Chinese may be the only <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>who</b> are completely unable to comprehend the basic human impulses of sympathy or gratitude toward other people. Because the Chinese feel no empathy toward others, they behave in an unbelievably sadistic and cruel fashion toward one another, and they view altruistic foreigners as targets to be mercilessly taken advantage of. Other traits Townsend identifies as being typically Chinese are cowardice, [...] lust for money, lack of a sense of personal hygiene, lack of critical thinking skills, insincerity, and obsession with hollow rites. Townsend believes that these traits are as notable among China's leaders and educated strata as much as they are in the poor masses, and his analysis of historical documents leads him to believe that they are not a recent product of the present chaos, but rather are deeply ingrained traits of China's national character. He concludes that the [...] "outstanding characteristics" [...] of the Chinese people [...] "neither enable other peoples to deal satisfactorily with them, nor enable the Chinese to deal satisfactorily with themselves." ...|$|E

2500|$|In late 2000, Simard {{said that}} he would not serve {{alongside}} Yves Michaud, a candidate for the PQ nomination in an upcoming Montreal by-election. Michaud had characterized Jewish support for the Canadian federalist option in the 1995 Quebec referendum as an [...] "ethnic vote against the sovereignty of the Quebec people" [...] and described B'nai Brith Canada as [...] "anti-sovereigntist extremists." [...] He was also quoted as saying that Jews believed themselves to be [...] "the only <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>who</b> have suffered." [...] Simard described Michaud's comments as [...] "an old anti-Semitic throwback that leave me no choice but to condemn." [...] Michaud, in turn, contended that he was [...] "falsely demonized" [...] by the reporting of his comments and was not anti-Semitic. This controversy exposed divisions in the ranks of the PQ and is widely believed to have provoked Lucien Bouchard's resignation as premier shortly thereafter.|$|E
