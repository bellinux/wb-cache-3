50|$|In December 2016, Hogan {{proposed}} {{state legislation}} to require large companies (those with 50 or more employees) to provide {{five days a}} year of paid sick leave. Hogan's bill was less expansive than legislation passed by the Democratic-controlled House of Delegates; it also would have preempted local legislation that was more generous to employees, such as mandated paid sick leave required by Montgomery County. In the legislature, Hogan's proposal failed to advance out of committee, and the House of Delegates passed more expansive legislation that would require companies with 15 employees or more to give seven <b>paid</b> <b>sick-leave</b> days a year, requires companies with fewer than 15 employees to provide five days of unpaid sick leave, and would afford benefits for part-time employees.|$|E
