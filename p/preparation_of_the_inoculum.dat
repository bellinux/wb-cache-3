40|$|<b>The</b> optimal {{production}} <b>of</b> P. haemolytica leukotoxin in <b>the</b> culture supernatant <b>of</b> a fluid {{medium is}} dependent on a number <b>of</b> factors. <b>The</b> leukotoxin has to be produced by using a strain that {{is known for its}} ability to produce high quantities of leukotoxin, inoculated into the most suitable type <b>of</b> medium at <b>the</b> correct culture density containing the necessary supplements and harvested after a certain growth period. The volume in which it is produced may also have an influence. Two different procedures are described to produce the leukotoxin in 5 to 15 -ℓ quantities in RPMI 1640 medium. The first method used to produce leukotoxin is one that has been repeatedly described since <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leukotoxin was first established in 1978. Using this method seven batches of leukotoxin were produced in litre quantities with leukotoxin activity ranging from 23 - 67 u/mℓ. <b>The</b> seed culture <b>inoculum</b> is prepared in brain heart infusion broth, which is centrifuged before the organisms are inoculated into RPMI 1640 medium containing 3, 5 % foetal calf serum and incubated for only 1 h in a fermenter, after, which the leukotoxin is harvested. An improved alternative method was devised which yielded higher levels of leukotoxin activity by utilising <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> P. haemolytica organisms to grow and produce leukotoxin during the logarithmic growth phase in a fermenter. A seed culture harvested in the log phase was prepared in brain heart infusion broth by means of a series of cultures and inoculated into RPMI 1640 containing 3, 5 % foetal calf serum. Three hours of active growth were allowed during which the leukotoxin was measured by its biological activity and an ELISA assay, and the increase in cell mass by means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optical density every 30 min. The average leukotoxin biological activity measured 260 u/mℓ and by means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ELISA test the leukotoxin concentration measured 315 u/ℓ which is a substantial increase in leukotoxin production. In comparison the average optical density only measured 0, 469 at 650 nm. Previous findings were substantiated that the highest cell density was not reflected in the highest leukotoxin activity.

40|$|In <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> {{several years}} of use of {{lyophilization}} for long term preservation of oxytetracycline producing Streptomyces strains, their morphogenetic stability and <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> their antibiotic yields were verified. <b>The</b> described process <b>of</b> lyophilization, as regards the viability and morphogenetic stability of both sporogenous and the asporogenous forms, has been proved very successful, with few exceptions. Data are given in Table II. Viable spore counts of 40 — 90. 8 % were satisfactory. <b>The</b> growth <b>of</b> lyophilized cultures on agar medium (P— 1) did not differ much from <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> non-lyophilized (control) cultures: <b>the</b> populations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cultures invariably retained all essential »starting« morphological characteristics. Only in {{a small number of}} cases alterations in some lyophilized cultures in comparison with the »starting« cultures were observed (e. g. T 6 — 429, T 6 — 483 and BIM— 197 in Table II). These differences were manifested by <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> small colonies (5 %), <b>the</b> disappearance <b>of</b> drops <b>of</b> exudate from <b>the</b> colonies center, or by differences in intensity of soluble pigment in the medium. No reliable explanation has been found for this phenomenon. It can probably be ascribed to microecological conditions (different composition of medium, temperature and the like). <b>The</b> growth <b>of</b> lyophilizates in a liquid medium (P— 2) owing to the almost complete anabiosis, was obviously somewhat slower (it averaged 10 — 16 hours) in comparison to the control cultures; the lyophilized asporogenous cultures, however, grew faster (4 — 6 hours) than the lyophilized sporogenous ones (see Table II). It has been proved that the remaining moisture in the lyophilizates is the limiting factor in attaining anabiosis and that, therefore, it is necessary to maintain the moisture within a narrow range and at a low level. <b>The</b> quality <b>of</b> cotton plugs considerably influences <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> lyophilization, especially at <b>the</b> stage <b>of</b> drying in <b>the</b> vacuum, so that full attention must be paid to <b>the</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> these plugs, particularly to their hardness. With regard to the stability in Oxytetracycline antibiotic yields (Table III), the tested lyophilizates have given different yields in comparison to the control cultures, in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same testing conditions in <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> experiments, especially in the laboratory. Tests with some lyophilized cultures were repeated, and results obtained showed approximately the same differences (Table III, figures in brackets). The yields were often higher than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control. The obtained Oxytetracycline yields on a production scale were very favourable and uniform, even in <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> prolonged use of lyophilized cultures for <b>the</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>inoculum.</b> <b>The</b> following conclusions are <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> many years of work and of data presented here: 1) <b>The</b> described process <b>of</b> lyophilization, as a whole, is suitable for a long term preservation of tested Oxytetracycline producing Streptomyces strains. 2) Both apparatuses used for lyophilization are suitable for the purpose described and produce lyophilizates <b>of</b> uniform quality. <b>The</b> model DELTA I/a is of higher capacity and therefore more suitable for production purposes, and for <b>the</b> maintaining <b>of</b> larger collections <b>of</b> cultures. 3) <b>The</b> optimum freezing temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cultures is — 50 to — 55 °C. 4) <b>The</b> remainder <b>of</b> moisture in <b>the</b> lyophilizates — because it is a determinant factor in attaining anabiosis on which <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> cultures depends — must be kept at the same, previously verified level. 5) Lyophilized cultures retained constant Oxytetracycline yields in <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four-year storage. 6) The porousness and <b>the</b> hardness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microbiological cotton plugs must be standardized for <b>the</b> sake <b>of</b> more successful lyophilization process...|$|R

The studies were performed on 8 - 12 week old inbred CBA mice. The tumors investigated were grown from freshly excised and cultured CCH 1 and T 3 fibrosarcoma tumor cells. The RIATs developed were based on isotopic antiglobulin tests which {{had been used in}} this department to determine circulating anti¬ tumor antibodies in tumor-bearing mice. They were modified and improved in order to be used to detect in vivo bound TAIgs in solid tumors. The indirect RIAT developed was used in both quantitative and qualitative TAIg studies. The more sensitive direct RIAT was used solely in quantitative studies on TAIgs. In order to optimize the test a number of variableswere investigated. These included <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> tumor cell <b>preparation</b> and <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> reagent concentration, tumor cell number, and <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> incubation. Furthermore, attempts were made to reduce nonspecific binding of reagents by precoating the plastic plates and tubes with various protein containing media. As a result of these investigations, techniques were developed which were sufficiently sensitive for semi-quantitative and semi-qualitative studies. In vivo bound TAIgs in solid tumors and its variation with age and size of tumors was assessed by both the {{direct and indirect}} RIATs. The more immunogenic CCH 1 tumors were found to possSss higher levels <b>of</b> TAIgs than <b>the</b> less immunogenic T 3 tumors. Moreover, tumors produced by <b>the</b> injection <b>of</b> tumor cells contaminated with host cells were found to possess higher levels of TAIgs than tumors produced by cultured tumor cells which are devoid of host cells. Similarly, tumor cells prepared in different ways(enzyme vs mechanical) were found to produce tumors of different TAIg content. In addition, the in vivo binding of TAIgs was found in general to vary positively with the age and size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tumors. <b>The</b> injection <b>of</b> 1 - 5 million tumor cells was found to produce larger tumors ?of higher TAIg content than <b>the</b> injection <b>of</b> 0. 1 - 0. 5 million tumor cells. Similar effects were noted whether the tumors were compared in different mice or on opposite limbs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same mouse. Comparative results were also obtained by a double radio—immunoassay test which was carried out in parallel with the RIATs. <b>The</b> amount <b>of</b> in vivo bound TAIg in solid tumors was thus found to be dependent on immunogenicity, method of maintenance (ie. in vivo or in vitro), and <b>the</b> method or <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tumor cell <b>inoculum.</b> <b>The</b> cellular basis <b>of</b> TAIgs was studied in immuno-stimulated and immuno-deficient mice. Intraperitoneal G. parvum (CP) administration resulted in an increase of TAIgs in both CCK 1 and T 3 tumor models, though this effect was more marked in the former. Moreover, additional studies revealed that CP treated CCH 1 tumors had higher levels of cell-surface bound IgA, IgG 2 b, and IgG 3 than non-treated CCH 1 tumors. Parallel qualitative studies on CCH 1 tumor extracts showed that CP treated tumors also had more IgGl, IgA and IgM. Studies were also performed in thymectomized and nude mice in order to assess <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> T-cell deprivation on the in vivo binding <b>of</b> TAIgs. <b>The</b> TAIg content in tumors grown in T-cell deficient mice was shown not to differ from tumors grown in normal mice. Preliminary experiments were also conducted on mice treated with gold salts in order to determine <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> macrophages in TAIg binding.

40|$|AbstractMicrobial {{fuel cell}} (MFC) {{is one of}} {{promising}} fuel cell technologies. MFC utilizes biochemical activity of microorganism to convert the substrate to produce electricity through metabolism processes. Although the generation of the electricity is still in mW scale, MFCs has a great potential for the future application. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the performance of MFCs with and without the methylene blue (MB) as an electron mediator utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae as biocatalysts and glucose as substrate to generate electricity. Methods performed comprise of the S. cerevisiae yeast culture rejuvenation, <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inoculum,</b> preparation of the MFC reactor, preparation of MFC medium with 2 % of glucose with and without MB mediator, periodical sampling, determination of growth curve, measurement of current, potential, calculation of power density, energy, glucose consumption, and production of bioethanol. MFC with mediator generated 5. 5 × 10 - 5 A of current, 0. 886 V of potential, 4. 48 × 10 - 3 W/m 2 of power density, 4. 14 × 10 - 3 J of energy, 95. 0 % of glucose consumption and 0. 74 % (v/v) of bioethanol produced during the MFC process, while MFC without mediator generated 4. 5 × 10 - 5 A of current, 0. 689 V of potential, 2. 12 × 10 - 3 W/m 2 of power density, 1. 96 × 10 - 3 J of maximum energy, 96. 3 % of glucose consumption and 0. 74 % (v/v) of bioethanol produced. Power density yields from both type of MFC are still very low and not differ significantly.

40|$|Increasing {{attention}} has been paid to dietary fibre (DF) fermentation in the large intestine of pigs during the past years in pig nutrition. The bacterial growth supported by DF intestinal fermentation induces a shift of N excretion from urea in urine to bacterial protein in faeces that reduces NH 3 emission from the manure. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the relationship between DF fermentability, intestinal bacteria growth and the N excretion. In the first part, an in vitro gas-test method using a living bacterial inoculum developed for ruminants was adapted to the pig. The use of pig colonic content was compared to faeces for the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inoculum</b> and it was concluded that faeces could replace intestinal content, avoiding the use of cannulated animals. Secondly, the influence of a pespin-pancreatin hydrolysis prior to the fermentation in order to simulate digestion in the stomach and the small intestine was demonstrated. Finally, the influence of the faeces donnor bodyweight and the dietary fibre content of its diet on the gas production kinetics was shown. When studying a topic related to a specific category of pig, it is recommended to use animals from the same category as faeces donors to prepare the inoculum. In the second part of the thesis, the amount of protein synthesis (PS) by faecal microbes fermenting different sources of purified carbohydrates, or ingredients differing in DF content, was measured using 15 N-labelled NH 4 Cl in the inoculum. PS ranged between 9. 8 and 22. 9 mg N g- 1 fermented carbohydrate according to the rate of fermentation of the carbohydrate and its soluble fibre content. These in vitro observations were confirmed through in vivo experiments with diets containing increasing levels of soluble DF: in vitro PS passed from 1. 51 to 2. 35 mg N g- 1 diet while in vivo urinary- N:fecal–N excretion ratio decreased from 2. 171 to 1. 177...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether a chlamydial isolate recovered from nasal swabs from swine with pneumonia could cause pneumonia and rhinitis in gnotobiotic pigs. The identity of the isolate currently is unknown, but it shares characteristics with Chlamydia trachomatis. After propagation in Vero cells and <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inoculum</b> (2. 5 x 1010 inclusion-forming units/ml), Chlamydiae were instilled into nostrils (1. 0 ml/nostril) and lungs (2. 0 ml intralaryngeally) of 15 anesthetized 3 -day-old gnotobiotic piglets. Five age-matched gnotobiotic piglets were anesthetized and sham infected with uninfected cell culture lysates. Two treated piglets were moribund and 2 were severely dyspneic prior to necropsy 7 days postinfection (DPI), whereas remaining treated piglets showed mild dyspnea upon exertion throughout the study. All treated piglets developed diarrhea. All treated piglets necropsied 7 - 21 DPI had extensive consolidation in cranial, middle, and accessory lung lobes; a majority of these piglets also had extensive consolidation in the caudal lobes. Treated piglets necropsied 28 and 35 DPI had a lobular pattern of consolidation in all lung lobes. Histologically, lesions in lungs from treated piglets necropsied 7, 14, and 21 DPI were characterized by bronchointerstitial pneumonia with foci of type II pneumocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia; pneumocytes and bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells were markedly vacuolated. Alveolar macrophages, peribronchitis, peribronchiolitis, and perivasculitis were seen in lungs from treated piglets necropsied 28 and 35 DPI; those necropsied 28 DPI also had foci of lymphohistiocytic and plasmacytic infiltrates. Turbinate lesions in all treated piglets were characterized by mild multifocal lymphoplasmacytic and occasionally neutrophilic rhinitis. Immunohistochemistry detected chlamydial antigen in bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells, pneumocytes, and inflammatory cells in treated piglets necropsied 7, 14, and 21 DPI. Positive staining was limited to alveolar macrophages in treated piglets necropsied 28 and 35 DPI. Chlamydial antigen was detected in turbinate epithelial cells at all necropsy intervals. Ultrastructurally, chlamydiae were seen with glycogen particles in vacuoles or free in the cytoplasm of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells and pneumocytes...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION The genus Phaseolus is {{attacked}} by soil fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Phaseol, which causes wilt or yellowing (Nunes, 2003), and once introduced to crops, has its most viable and effective control {{with the use}} of resistant cultivars (Sartorato 2 ̆ 6 Rava, 1994). Considering that obtaining disease-resistant cultivars {{is one of the most}} efficient ways to avoid considerable losses of productivity (Pereira 2 ̆ 6 Ribeiro, 2012), this work aimed to evaluate the performance of snap bean of determined growth as resistance to Fusarium Oxysporum f. sp. Phaseoli during the development of plants. MATERIAL AND METHODS Four strains of bean pods of determined growth habit were evaluated, using as a control the cultivar UEL 1. The sowing occurred on 04 / 03 / 2011, with five seeds per pot. For sowing, ceramic vessels with a capacity of five liters were used, with spacing of 0. 1 m x 0. 6 m between vessels. The soil used consisted of a clay soil with a clay texture, corrected through the formulated fertilizer 08 - 28 - 16 at the dose of 0. 05 kg per pot. After the emergency, thinning was performed, maintaining one plant per pot. In the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inoculum</b> the modified methodology of inoculation with colonized sorghum grains was used (Gasperi, 2000; Klingelfuss et al., 2002). Following the methodology, maize grains colonized with Fusarium were used for inoculation of the bean-pod strains, performed on 01 / 04 / 2011, when the plant reached the V 4 development stage. In this procedure, two colonies of corn colonized on the substrate of each vessel were introduced. At the end of the crop cycle the yellowing symptoms caused by Fusarium were evaluated, and there were no lesions in the plant colon. In this evaluation, grades were assigned according to Gasperi 2 ̆ 7 s methodology (2000) : resistant 0 - 1, 0; Moderately resistant 1. 1 - 1. 5; Moderately susceptible 1. 6 - 2. 0; Susceptible 2. 1 - 2. 5 and highly susceptible 2. 6 - 3. 0. In the harvest performed on 06 / 05 / 2011, pods, roots and aerial part of the plants were weighed. The experimental design was completely randomized, in a 5 x 2 factorial scheme (five lines and two treatments, inoculated with Fusarium and without inoculation), with four replications. The data were submitted to analysis of variance and the means of the treatments compared by the Tukey test at 5...|$|E
