A state <b>parastatal</b> which could procure arms in a direct manner while circumventing the army's cumbersome tender process was perceived as necessary for the war effort. Colonel Ian Stansfield, former Quartermaster-General and chief of the ZNA's Procurement Office, was appointed to lead the new effort. Stansfield aimed to build on the once-vibrant defence industry generated by the Rhodesian Bush War. He thus contracted with the separate firms that had once manufactured armoured vehicles, munitions, and small arms during that conflict and offered them an inroad into the export market under the auspices of a united Zimbabwe Defence Industries.|$|E

It also surfaced that the minister had not even placed a bid of their own. The minister defended his actions by claiming his firm was eligible to receive SDF money.|$|E
25|$|When Malawi’s {{agricultural}} sector was liberalised, {{it was expected}} that the role of the <b>parastatal</b> ADMARC would be taken over by private traders, and that the private sector would create an efficient marketing system that would stimulate the use of fertilizer and hybrid maize, which in turn would lead to expanded distribution networks. Liberalisation, it was hoped, would create an efficient and responsive private sector marketing system that would stimulate agricultural production. In Malawi, the withdrawal of ADMARC from most areas contributed to widespread food insecurity among smallholder farmers, especially those in remote areas. To fill up the vacuum created following the withdrawal of ADMARC, the Ministry of Agriculture launched a development programme to train agro-dealers preferably rural shop owners. This started in 2001 with financial support from the USAID, but the programme had limited success as the majority of those trained ceased to be active agro-dealers within a few years of training, and most continuing agro-dealers were not rural based small-businessmen, as to start a successful dealing business required more capital than these possessed.|$|E

40|$|This study {{sought to}} develop a {{governance}} model {{to assess the impact}} of corporate governance on the performance of state enterprises and <b>parastatals</b> in Zimbabwe. The study first did a literature review on corporate government systems around the world and in Zimbabwe. The background of state enterprises and <b>parastatals</b> in Zimbabwe was explored to understand the problems facing these state corporations. The challenge was how to turn around the fortunes of these corporations and make them more viable through better corporate governance. The research question was: To what extent will good corporate governance in state enterprises and <b>parastatals</b> enhance their performance? The research used quantitative methodology for data gathering and analysis and the questionnaire was used as the research instrument. The sample contained a mixture of 20 state enterprises and <b>parastatals</b> covering commercial, regulatory and economic and social. A questionnaire was selfâ€“administered to the respondents and collected by the researcher after completion. The study found that there are very weak linkages between the corporate governance variables such as the role of the minister, the role of the board, board tenure, expertise and performance of state enterprises and <b>parastatals.</b> This means that there should be a more robust model to better understand the relationship between corporate governance and improved performance. The various recommendations made should improve corporate governance in SEPs and enhance their performance. Since some linkages were found between performance and remuneration and board composition it shows that corporate governance has some impact on performance of state enterprises and <b>parastatals.</b> It will be necessary in future research to develop a model which includes the contextual factors such as political, economic, social, environmental and legal. The timing of the study could also have influenced the outcome. It may be useful to carry out another study at a different time when there is no turbulence in SEPs...|$|R

25|$|Cotton {{was first}} {{planted in the}} Shire valley by Eugene Sharrer, and the British Central Africa Company {{continued}} to grow cotton on its Chelumbo and Chikwawa estates. From 1903 the company also encouraged cotton cultivation by African smallholders in the Upper Shire District, by distributing cheap Egyptian cotton seed. The company gave instruction on the method of cultivation and agreed to buy the future crop at a guaranteed (but low) price. There was no significant shortage of land for peasant farming in the Upper Shire Valley, as the British Central Africa Company only exploited {{a small proportion of}} its land and, until the 1930s, the company tolerated squatters who did not pay rent on its land. Its tenants had to perform labour thangata or grow cotton for sale to the company, but in general there was plenty of land available for food production. The efforts of the colonial administration to introduce cotton as a peasant cash-crop were largely unsuccessful, as the prices paid to the peasants were low, so they concentrated on growing food. The British Central Africa Company Ltd also had a cotton ginnery for processing its own and smallholder cotton until at least 1961. In 1971, the purchase and processing of smallholder cotton was taken over by a <b>parastatal</b> body.|$|E

25|$|State {{intervention}} in marketing peasant produce was justified in colonial times as protecting farmers against commodity price fluctuations. However, in ADMARC, development and profit-making were given priority of over price stabilization. At first, ADMARC accumulated substantial profits and re-invested {{them in a}} range of private companies and statutory corporations. Compared to those its neighbours Tanzania, Zambia, and later Mozambique and Zimbabwe, Malawi’s <b>parastatal</b> bodies were less bureaucratic and aimed to be business-like and profitable. In particular, its ADMARC was considered efficient until 1980. With an economic decline {{at the start of the}} 1980s, the flaws in its strategy became apparent. Profit accumulation had reduced the economic well-being of the peasant producers. The main beneficiaries of this strategy were the political elite who controlled organisations sponsored by ADMARC, the urban population obtaining subsidised food and the employees of ADMARC and other state bodies. Transferring resources away from smallholders to the state led to corruption and abuse of office. In 1977, a long serving ADMARC chairman was convicted for misusing corporation property in his private businesses and of making large unauthorised loans to a private company in which he and family were involved. Corruption and general inefficiency in statutory corporations including ADMARC resulted in a 1980 law limiting their holding office for a renewable two year period. This was not followed by any change in ADMARC's business activities or its conflicting roles as a marketing organization and provider of development finance.|$|E

40|$|Since South Africa is a {{developing}} state, {{the roles of}} the <b>parastatals</b> in stimulating economic growth and contributing to the alleviation of unemployment and poverty eradication are inevitable. South African <b>parastatals</b> find themselves with numerous initiatives that become projects as part of these initiatives. The projects vary from small to large capital investments. <b>Parastatals</b> are strategic assets that need to account for taxpayers’ funds. This thesis considers that the executed projects can add value only if there is a link to the strategic objectives. The effectiveness of this link can be established by having benefit realisation metrics. The metrics should have a process of measuring performance of projects based on strategic objectives. The thesis views projects that are executed outside strategic objectives as not viable. Without a clear process of using strategic objectives as a guide to measure success of projects, the expenditure in <b>parastatals</b> will remain unaccounted for, resulting in what could lead to a PFMA issue. The argument in this thesis, as well as its theoretical concept, is that the lack of strategic leadership has resulted in the challenges facing <b>parastatals</b> with regard to capital expansion and small projects that are executed without linking them to strategic objectives. Aggravating this situation is the blind loyalty to the PMBOK framework used by <b>parastatals</b> in executing projects; yet the framework has a gap regarding the knowledge areas of leadership and change management. The development of the thesis is through in-depth interviews carried out in two <b>parastatals,</b> namely, Eskom and Transnet. The interviews were conducted with respondents who are involved in projects, ranging from senior executives down to project administrators. The research was done in order to assess whether the projects executed in <b>parastatals</b> do, indeed, support strategic objectives. The effectiveness of the link between projects and strategy was {{based on the premise that}} when strategic leadership components are practised by the leadership, an execution process requiring proof of value add to the business through a link to the strategic objectives will be the basis for executing projects. The research found organisational structures that were rigid, and bureaucracy was the norm. The PMBOK framework that had been adopted was inadequate. Major findings were that most projects were not linked to strategic objectives and that there was poor strategic leadership at all levels. In view of this, there is a need to get the right leadership and have a rigorous process of ensuring that initiatives that become projects are, indeed, linked to the strategic objectives. 1...|$|R
