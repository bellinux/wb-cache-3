40|$|Background: <b>Patient</b> <b>chart</b> {{review is}} the gold {{standard}} for detection of potential patient hazards (i. e. medication errors or failure to follow up actionable results) in both routine clinical care and patient safety research. However, advanced medical students ’ ability to read patient charts and to identify patient hazards is rather poor. We therefore investigated whether it is possible to teach advanced medical students how to identify patient hazards independent of context (i. e. cancer versus cardiac failure) in patient charts. Methods: All fifth-year medical students in one semester (n = 123) were randomized into two groups. One group (IC) received a <b>patient</b> <b>chart</b> review-training first and then a control-intervention and the other group (CI) received the control-intervention first and then the <b>patient</b> <b>chart</b> review-training. Before and after the teaching sessions, students reviewed different scenarios with standardized fictional patient charts containing 12 common patient hazards. Two blinded raters rated the students ’ notes for any patient hazard addressed in the notes using a checklist. The students were blinded to the study question and design. There was no external funding and no harm for the participating students. Results: A total of 35 data sets had to be excluded because of missing data. Overall, the students identified 17 % (IQR 8 – 29 %) of the patient hazards before the training and 56 % (IQR 41 – 66 %) of the patient hazards after the training. At th...|$|E

40|$|We {{conducted}} an experiment {{to determine if}} the terms recorded by nurses in the <b>patient</b> <b>chart</b> to describe patient problems could be represented using SNOMED III terms. The data sources for the patient problems were the nurses' progress notes and nursing care plans from 485 patient encounters in three diverse settings (NR 02215). We entered the nursing terms into a relational database. We loaded the SNOMED III terms into a relational database and created a word index. We determined matches by identifying the English description of the SNOMED III term that best matched the term charted by the nurses. Sixty-nine percent of the nursing terms in the test subset were matched using one or more SNOMED III terms. We identified redundant SNOMED III terms for several nursing terms including fear and diarrhea. Our results suggest that terms recorded by nurses in the <b>patient</b> <b>chart</b> can be represented using SNOMED III terms. Further enhancement and refinement will improve the domain completeness of SNOMED III as a controlled healthcare vocabulary and decrease redundancies...|$|E

40|$|In 1999, the Institute of Medicine {{released}} its report on building a safer health system. Since then, safety in patient care {{has become a}} paramount interest. Given the growing support for increasing patient safety, simulation training has become a common part of novice nurses 2 ̆ 7 orientation program. This simulation training is designed to mimic situations in the acute care setting where novice nurses can practice in a patient safe environment. In this DNP project, a stroke simulation scenario and supporting <b>patient</b> <b>chart</b> was developed as an addition to a novice nurses 2 ̆ 7 orientation program. The National League for Nursing simulation template was used to ensure successful incorporation of the League 2 ̆ 7 s standards and evidence-based practices. Five local experts were chosen to review the developed stroke simulation and corresponding <b>patient</b> <b>chart.</b> After reviewing, the experts were given a Likert-types evaluation survey to complete. The results of these surveys revealed that all experts strongly agreed that the simulation scenario was easy to follow and that the simulation <b>patient</b> <b>chart</b> provided the supporting information needed for the scenario. All experts strongly agreed that the simulation scenario {{would be easy to}} incorporate into the existing simulation programs and that the simulation scenario would enhance the critical thinking and decision making of the novice nurse. Lastly, all five of the participants strongly agreed the simulation scenario would increase patient safety when novice nurses are faced with similar situations in the acute care setting. The products of this project have been made available to the local healthcare facility for incorporation into its existing orientation program for novice nurses. The purpose of developing this simulation training is to improve the novice nurse ability and confidence to make a positive social change...|$|E

40|$|In this article, I {{will discuss}} the {{connections}} between narrativity, embodiment and relationality in the practise of doctoring and nursing. In particular, I will elucidate these connections by discussing the <b>patient</b> <b>chart</b> as a diagnostic tool that also determines the kind of relationship the doctor or nurse adopts vis-à-vis the patient and thus what kind of embodiment becomes the subject of examination. This becomes a way to seek the ill body; the body to which medicine devotes its care. The perspective is derived primarily from contemporary philosophy, the history of ideas and the medical humanities. The task of the article is critical {{in the sense that}} I aim to analyse the connections mentioned to shed light on their historical and philosophical foundations and thus be able to suggest possible alternatives to accepted practice. I will begin by discussing the narrative basis of diagnosis and showing the philosophical differences between the inanimate body and the lived body. I will thereafter discuss what may be called ‘bodily absence’ before returning to the <b>patient</b> <b>chart</b> and how the chart can stage various connections between narrativity, embodiment and relationality in doctoring and nursing.
