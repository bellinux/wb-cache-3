The evidence suggests that the invading Arctic wolves arrived into east Greenland by unintentional human mediated jump dispersal.

40|$|The {{dispersal}} of mangrove <b>propagules</b> in the Normanby River estuary {{is dominated by}} secondary estuarine circulation. On flood tides, an axial surface convergence forms midstream, generated by a density-driven circulation cell. Floating material including mangrove <b>propagules</b> is trapped in the convergence, and moves upstream. On ebb tides, the circulation cell reverses, and <b>propagules</b> move towards the banks, where water velocities are much smaller than midstream. Over a tidal cycle, a net upstream drift of <b>propagules</b> occurs. This displacement effect occurs throughout the tropical dry season.

50|$|<b>Propagule</b> {{pressure}} (also termed introduction effort) is {{a composite}} measure {{of the number of}} individuals of a species released into a region to which they are not native. It incorporates estimates of the absolute number of individuals involved in any one release event (<b>propagule</b> size) and the number of discrete release events (<b>propagule</b> number). As the number of releases or the number of individuals released increases, <b>propagule</b> pressure also increases. <b>Propagule</b> pressure can be defined as the quality, quantity, and frequency of invading organisms (Groom, 2006). <b>Propagule</b> pressure is a key element to why some introduced species persist while others do not (Lockwood, 2005). Species introduced in large quantities and consistent quantities prove more likely to survive, whereas species introduced in small numbers with only a few release events are more likely to go extinct (Lockwood, 2005). <b>Propagule</b> pressure {{is a composite}} measure to the number of individuals released into a non-native region (Lockwood, 2005). Three approaches are used to study and measure <b>propagule</b> pressure. One approach introduces a specific amount of propagules into controlled plots. A second approach allows introduced species to mature and colonize naturally while observing native and non-native species during the colonization. The final approach used to study and measure <b>propagule</b> pressure utilizes past records of the numbers of individuals introduced, including natural introductions and intentional introductions (Colautti et al., 2003).|$|E

While <b>propagules</b> from different estuaries showed big variations in buoyancy, generally mangroves in the north produced {{a high proportion of}} ‘floaters’ while those in the south produced mainly ‘sinkers’. The buoyancy of <b>propagules</b> appeared to be determined by the relative densities of the different parts of the cotyledons.

Some of the ‘sinkers’ were found to become buoyant after a period of submersion, although <b>propagules</b> from all estuaries did not behave in this way.

This study {{compiled}} {{available information}} on the dispersal distance of the <b>propagules</b> of benthic marine organisms and used this information {{in the development of}} criteria for the design of marine reserves. Many benthic marine organisms release <b>propagules</b> that spend time in the water column before settlement. During this period, ocean currents transport or disperse the <b>propagules.</b> When considering the size of a marine reserve and the spacing between reserves, one must consider the distance which <b>propagules</b> disperse. We could find estimates of dispersal distance for 32 taxa; for 25 of these, we were also able to find data on the time the <b>propagules</b> spent dispersing. Dispersal distance ranged from meters to thousands of kilometers, and time in the plankton ranged from minutes to months.

40|$|The saltmarsh-mangrove {{interface}} generally {{constitutes the}} landward boundary for the grey mangrove Avicennia marina var. australasica, {{the most widespread}} species on southeast Queensland shores. A. marina produces buoyant <b>propagules,</b> which are dispersed by tidal waters, only infrequently transported to saltmarsh by the highest spring tides. We predicted that runnelling, a form of habitat modification for mosquito control, transports and deposits mangrove <b>propagules</b> to saltmarsh because the runnels carry low-amplitude tides that would not normally inundate higher regions of the marsh. To test this, groups of marked A. marina <b>propagules</b> were released at three runnelled saltmarshes in southeast Queensland during high-amplitude, flooding and low-amplitude, non-flooding tidal events. The distance <b>propagules</b> were transported from their original starting positions on the saltmarsh-mangrove interface was measured and analysed to detect differences among groups at different distances from runnels. Groups of <b>propagules</b> released within 10 m of a runnel were always transported significantly further from the starting position and further up the saltmarsh shore after both flooding and non-flooding tides than any other groups. In addition, the pattern of stranding on saltmarsh for significantly different groups was {{closely associated with the}} path of runnel construction so that <b>propagules</b> were located either in the runnel or in depressions linked to the runnel that had been isolated mosquito-breeding pools prior to runnelling. Observations of A. marina plants at other runnelled sites suggest that <b>propagules</b> transported by runnels can establish and develop to maturity, at least in depressions and runnels, in saltmarsh. The fact that runnels transport <b>propagules</b> to regions of the saltmarsh beyond their normal limits of dispersion suggests a possible advantage for landward extension of the intertidal distribution of A. marina at runnelled sites and should be considered in saltmarsh management and mosquito control programmes in southeast Queensland.
