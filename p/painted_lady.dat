5|$|Many butterflies, {{such as the}} <b>painted</b> <b>lady,</b> monarch, {{and several}} danaine migrate for long distances. These migrations take place {{over a number of}} generations and no single {{individual}} completes the whole trip. The eastern North American population of monarchs can travel thousands of miles south-west to overwintering sites in Mexico. There is a reverse migration in the spring. It has recently been shown that the British <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> undertakes a 9,000-mile round trip in a series of steps by up to six successive generations, from tropical Africa to the Arctic Circle — almost double the length of the famous migrations undertaken by monarch. Spectacular large-scale migrations associated with the monsoon are seen in peninsular India. Migrations have been studied in more recent times using wing tags and also using stable hydrogen isotopes.|$|E
5|$|In summer, the {{dragonfly}} pond {{can hold}} up to ten species of dragonflies and damselflies. The nationally scarce moth flame wainscot has bred at Titchwell since 1996; other Lepidoptera may include migrants such as the <b>painted</b> <b>lady,</b> the diamondback moth, and especially the silver Y, which can occur in huge numbers; 90,000 were recorded on the reserve in July 2010, feeding on sea lavender.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{recorded}} visiting white-flowered plants {{include the}} Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> (Vanessa kershawi) and yellow admiral (V. itea), {{as well as}} bees. Field work in southern Tasmania showed that the introduced bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) sometimes robbed nectar by piercing {{the base of the}} tube. This then allowed honeybees (Apis mellifera) to retrieve nectar the same way. Epacris impressa is host to the scale insect Lecanodiaspis microcribraria.|$|E

50|$|In American architecture, <b>painted</b> <b>ladies</b> are Victorian and Edwardian {{houses and}} {{buildings}} painted {{in three or}} more colors that embellish or enhance their architectural details. The term was first used for San Francisco Victorian houses by writers Elizabeth Pomada and Michael Larsen in their 1978 book <b>Painted</b> <b>Ladies</b> - San Francisco's Resplendent Victorians.|$|R
5|$|The brightly {{coloured}} bracts act as petals {{to attract}} insects such as hoverflies, native bees, and small beetles that pollinate the florets. Grasshoppers also visit the flower heads. The caterpillars of Tebenna micalis {{have been recorded}} on this species, as have those of the Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> (Vanessa kershawi). The tiny fruits are dispersed by wind, and germinate and grow after fire or on disturbed ground.|$|E
5|$|The green hairstreak, purple hairstreak, hummingbird hawk-moth and {{ghost moth}} are {{sometimes}} seen, {{particularly in the}} woods at Holkham, along with the common butterfly and moth species. In some years the clouded yellow, Camberwell beauty, <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> or diamondback moth may be seen, and the silver Y can sometimes occur in huge numbers. The dune tiger beetle is a nationally rare denizen of moist sand dunes.|$|E
5|$|A survey {{completed}} in November 2009 found 50 types {{of trees in}} the gardens.

Species of birds observed in the gardens have included song thrush, jay, wren, robin, kingfisher and tawny owl. Mammals regularly observed include hedgehogs, grey squirrels and foxes. Butterflies including the holly blue and <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> have been recorded.|$|E

5|$|Girlschool are a British {{rock band}} that {{formed in the}} new wave of British heavy metal scene in 1978 and {{frequently}} associated with contemporaries Motörhead. They are the longest running all-female rock band, still active after more than 35 years. Formed from a school band called <b>Painted</b> <b>Lady,</b> Girlschool enjoyed strong media exposure and commercial success in the UK in the early 1980s with three albums of 'punk-tinged metal' and a few singles, but lost their momentum in the following years.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{are often}} polymorphic, and many species {{make use of}} camouflage, mimicry and aposematism to evade their predators. Some, like the monarch and the <b>painted</b> <b>lady,</b> migrate over long distances. Many {{butterflies}} are attacked by parasites or parasitoids, including wasps, protozoans, flies, and other invertebrates, or are preyed upon by other organisms. Some species are pests because in their larval stages they can damage domestic crops or trees; other species are agents of pollination of some plants. Larvae of a few butterflies (e.g., harvesters) eat harmful insects, and a few are predators of ants, while others live as mutualists in association with ants. Culturally, butterflies are a popular motif in the visual and literary arts.|$|E
5|$|Fuller painted {{other works}} for the Hacketts. In a 1937 piece {{reflecting}} on early twentieth-century art in Western Australia, a reviewer recalled:Dr. (later Sir Winthrop) Hackett was a great patron of Miss Fuller, {{and he was a}} constant visitor to her dignified studio, above his office in the old West Australian Chambers. The first portrait I saw Miss Fuller working on was of Mrs. E. Chase... The portrait was a commission from Dr. Hackett, and was destined to hang in his gallery. Miss Fuller <b>painted</b> <b>Lady</b> Hackett both before and after her marriage, and one particularly happy picture of her is as a young girl gathering wildflowers in the Darlington hills. Her portraits of the first Hackett babies were charming studies of childhood.|$|E

25|$|The Australian {{painted and}} the <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> have very similar lifestyles and behaviours, but the Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> {{lives in an}} arid and {{stressful}} environment. Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> colouration could be induced in <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> butterflies by injecting the larvae with stress-inducing hormones and subjecting them to lowered temperatures. This demonstrates the phenotypic plasticity, or the tendency for visible traits to vary with changing environmental conditions, of the <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> butterflies. It also suggests that the <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> is the ancestral form, and environmental stress slowly drove speciation by adaptation into the Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady.</b> In other words, the Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> most likely evolved from the <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> due to the environmental conditions in Australia.|$|E
25|$|The Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> {{belongs to}} the family Nymphalidae and genus Vanessa, which compromises 22 species, which are {{strongly}} migratory. The Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> {{is similar to the}} near-cosmopolitan <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> (V. cardui), so it considered by some to be a subspecies of that. However, throughout its range, the <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> does not exhibit much variation, but the male genitalia of the Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> is distinct from that of the <b>painted</b> <b>lady,</b> which suggests that it is a separate species. The Australian species' four ventral eyespots are less clearly defined, and it always sports at least three (often four) conspicuous blue pupil spots on each dorsal hindwings' eyespots. V. cardui has either a few tiny pupil spots, or more often, none at all.|$|E

25|$|Observations of the Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> {{migration}} {{date back}} to the 1960s. In 1963, a large migration took place in a south-easterly direction from late August to late September. It was characterized by the species becoming suddenly common in certain areas where the it had previously been sparse. That year was noted to have been unusually wet in Australia. This could be a trait shared with V. cardui, which migrates in Europe during the wet season. The Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> migrates south in the spring and summer, and north in the autumn and winter.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} of the Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> lasts around 53 days in the summer. The females lay eggs in {{the centre of the}} leaf of food plants. The eggs are green and hatch in about three days. As a caterpillar, the Australian <b>painted</b> <b>lady</b> is only active at night, during which its main {{activity}} is feeding. During the day, it hides in a curled leaf or {{at the foot of a}} food plant. The pupa hangs vertically from the underside of the leaf of a food plant, and the duration of the pupal stage is about two weeks.|$|E
