The study covered oats cultivated on plots after potatoes (in crops rotation system with 25 % share of oats) and twice after oats (75 % share of oats in the rotation system) during the years 1990 - 2000. Simpson's species domination ratio and domination structure in the association identifying groups of: dominants, subdominants, influents and accessory species, were computed and studied. Relations between the studied <b>phytocenosis</b> features and weather conditions and oats yield were also determined. It was shown that quantitative relations in the assessed competitor associations were characterized by high variability between years and vegetation periods while no major {{differences were found between}} positions in the crop rotation systems. The density of spring <b>phytocenosis</b> during 11 years of studies increased resulting from increasing numbers of weeds appearing; during the late vegetation period they changed the density of associations slightly. In the spring, the groups competitive to the group of dominants consisted usually of the crop and Thlaspi arvense as well as Chenopodium album; with the passage of years their position strengthened. The enrichment of species in <b>phytocenosis</b> was represented mainly by an increase in numbers of accessory species. At the end of vegetation the importance of oats as a dominant increased significantly; during some seasons Chenopodium album co-dominated, however, with the passage of years the group of subdominants grew. Domination ratios for the studied competitor groups decreased with the passage of years, parallel to decrease of oats share in them. The studied features of <b>phytocenosis</b> showed a stronger correlation to the passage of years than the weather development. Invasiveness of weeds increased during consecutive seasons of cultivation while it showed less correlation with the density of oats. Oats yields showed a slight decreasing trend from year to year and was highly determined by the density of the entire weeds assemblage and in the spring by density and share of dominating species...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} the author’s {{attention}} is focused on the role and position of the <b>phytocenosis</b> in the ecosystem and the importance of phytoceno- logical investigations for the ecological, zoocenological and microbioceno- logical researches, and for the complex (teamwork) research of the ecosystem. The vegetable kingdom, as the only transformator of solar energy and the only of organic matter on the earth, constitutes a primarly, basic component not only of the biosphere, but also of every concrete biogeocenosis (ecosystem) on the earth. All the components of biosphere and particular ecosystems are, however, linked together with interrelations of conditionality and constant dependence (phyto-, zoo- and microbiocenosis and the biotope) in the unique process of matter and energy circulation. Thanks to this circulation, the survival and permanent regeneration of the ecosysten as a unique whole and of each of its components are made possible. Therefore, the true and complete ecological reality on the earth are only the biosphere and biogeocenosis (ecosystem), and not the phytosphere, <b>phytocenosis</b> and other components. When the position and role of one of the ecosystem components is separately determined, {{this does not mean that}} other components are underrated or that this is done by a conscious phylosophical or practical (research) dismemberment of the ecosystem, but that this is a methodically justified and necessary analysis of the significance of each of individual components for other components and the ecosystem as a whole. This may undoubtedly be useful not only in specialized (phytocenological, zoocenological, microbio- cenological) investigations, but also in complex investigations of the ecosystem. In addition to its basic and primary role in the metabolism of the ecosystem, the <b>phytocenosis</b> also represents a structurally most organized, most complex, most stable and most durable component of the ecosystem. As such, it constitutes its basis not only as regards the metabolism and structure but also the dynamics and succession. The vertical and horizontal differentiation of the ecosystem is to a large measure determined by the differentiation of the phytomass and the whole structure of the <b>phytocenosis.</b> Thus, for instance, the <b>phytocenosis</b> strata constitute the basis of biogeocenotic synusiae (Sukachev), that is, the basic structural parts of the ecosystem. But these may by further differentiated into biogeocenotic horizonts on the basis of animal and microbic species, groups and communities (Bjalovic). The time (seasonal and many-year) structure of <b>phytocenosis</b> and their historical successive development represent the basis for the dynamic and succession of zoo- and microbiocenoses and biotope, despite the <b>phytocenosis</b> dependence on other ecosystem components which obey their own laws of development and variability. As indicators of general climate, microclimate, phytoclimate and soil climate, and of other conditions of the biotope, the plant species, their cenotic groups (synusiae, micro- and macrocenotic complexes) and whole phytocenoses, may help analyze and differentiate the biocenosis and biotope. The bounderies of phyto-, zoo- and microbiocenoses often do not coincide, because the animal species and microorganisms and their communities are more variable and dynamic and with different manners of life and different reaction norms than the plant species and communities. In spite of this, a <b>phytocenosis,</b> (association) may serve as a basis for singling out, analyzing and classifying biogeocenoses, and provided that a teamwork system is employed in biocenotical investigations of concrete biogeocenoses, each particular case by itself may be solved, and in this way unique biogeocenotic types may gradually be formed. Investigations made no for by the local and foreign researches are eharakterized, on the one hand, by a very limited utilization of the results of phytocenological investigations, and on the other, by an insufficient collaboration of ecologists of different specialities in the complex study of ecosystem. And this is the task of the contemporary biocenology...|$|E

40|$|Aim. The {{aim was to}} {{identify}} the possibility of recycling the carbon in the atmosphere and the efficient use of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) coming to the soil surface {{by means of the}} formation of highly natural <b>phytocenosis</b> in the back half of the summer and to minimize soil preparation period for the next crop in the rotation. Methods. We studied two systems of soil management in the stubble period, they cause: Firstly, CO 2 emissions from the soil under the existing soil cultivation methods for crop rotation in the region. Secondly, the accumulation of CO 2  in the organic mass of natural <b>phytocenosis</b> followed by plowing the green mass in the stage of milk-wax ripeness of the seeds – the dominants, and minimizing the period of preparing the ground for the next crop rotation. Result. According to the obtained data, it shows that a nutritious regime of soil under the winter wheat during plowing of green mass of natural <b>phytocenosis</b> is substantially improved compared to the tillage system. Similar findings were obtained by other researchers that justify the fact that the green manure crops, in this case natural phytocoenosis, throughout its life involves hard compound subarable soil layers in the biological cycle which is used to create organic matter. Conclusion. We provide a scientific rationale for the inexpediency of the use of existing tillage systems in agricultural landscapes, which are causing systematic destruction of weed - field vegetation during the periods free from agrocenoses. </p...|$|E

These results allow to postulate that the uncontrolled grazing practiced in that microregion of Paraíba State, is leading to an environmental degradation of the "caatinga" <b>phytocenosis</b> (a set of plants with ecological similar preferences, {{living in the same}} biotope) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the results of studies of the young growth of main forest-forming coniferous species in four types of native cedar forest of the Sikhote-Alin nature reserve. The following types of young growth were measured: Manchurian fir (Abies nephrolepis), Ajan spruce (Picea ajanensis), Japanese yew (Taxus cuspidata), and Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis). The research was conducted during 5 field seasons from 2008 to 2012 at 4 permanent study areas. For each species, the common silvicultural parameters, distribution of height, age of young growth and dynamics of the average apical growth data for the twenty-year period were identified and analysed. It was established that the size and strength of young growth are affected by complex forest site conditions that are determined by: the composition of the parent canopy, stand age, and position in the landscape. The growing conditions for young growth conifers are more favourable in mountain cedar forests compared to cedar forests in a valley. A parent canopy of a specific <b>phytocenosis</b> forms a unique microclimate, significantly weakening and softening the impact of macro-climate indicators of the growing area on the value of the apical growth of young growth. Spruce young growth is the most responsive to changes in climatic parameters and Korean pine young growth is the least responsive...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The study {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the cormophyte diversity that constitutes aquatic <b>phytocenosis</b> and swamp wetlands of the main lake areas of Timis County: Surduc, Liebling, Pișchia and Sânandrei (meanwhile, the Lake Sânandrei was drained). The vegetation in these locations {{has been the subject of}} a doctoral thesis (NEACȘU, 2008). This work is based on a number of 134 (phytosociological) surveys, as well as 29 vegetal associations (sensu COLDEA et al., 1997, SANDA et al., 1998). Among these, 7 are aquatic and 22 paludicolous or others. Number of phytocenoses sampled from each association varies by coenosis ’ occupied area and uniformity, ranging from 1 (e. g. associations Lemno minoris – Spirodeletum W. Koch 1954, Agrostidetum stoloniferae (Ujvárosi 1941) Burduja et al. 1956, Alopecuretum pratensis Regel 1925) and 15 (e. g. association Caricetum ripario – acutiformis Kobenza 1930). Specific diversity variables are shown in the number of species per surveying, species average per surveying, number of species per association, the number of species per site. It was observed that aquatic phytocoenosis are either monospecific or consist of a small number of species, while others have a higher specific diversity. The number of species per surveying is between 1 (e. g. association Najadetum minori...|$|E
40|$|Ecology of {{expansion}} species {{is still a}} hot topic. The antropogenic landscape gradually occurred since the Neolithic. The {{result has been a}} change in the structure of plant communities and the successful expansion of species such as Calamagrostis epigejos. C. epigejos is expansive, perennial, long-stemmed, rhizomatous grass. Its important characteristic are very large ecological amplitude, high biomass production and a ability adjust habitat conditions. Experiments and studies that are included in dissertation, have the following basic objectives: (1) Investigate the expansion of C. epigejos in plant community. (2) Investigate the theoretical degree of stability of this <b>phytocenosis.</b> (3) Determine the response of C. epigejos to nutrients availability. (4) Test of possibility eliminating of C. epigejos. (5) Suggest a practical use of C. epigeos. Primarily, we monitored the reaction of interest species to management (aplication of N, P, K nutrients, mowing in various combinations). We were interested in its behavior in the plant community. It founded field and pot experiment. Results of field experiment were also used to calculate the theoretical measure of the stability of individual variants. Further research has been directed at eliminating C. epigejos using wireworms (Elateridae larvae species). The study which uses C epigejos for monitoring of deposition of heavy metals, has shown that aspects of the global expansion of the grass are not always negative...|$|E
40|$|Dynamics {{of annual}} {{increments}} of green moss Hylocomium splendens (Hedw.) Schimp. in B. S. G. in the Khakassia forest-steppe zone has been studied. The {{values of the}} moss linear and phytomass increments were investigated in different habitats for 6 years. The aboveground annual production of the H. splendens in <b>phytocenosis</b> was estimated. Linear increments of the H. splendens growing under the tree canopy and opening between trees were not significantly different. Phytomass increments under the tree canopy are significantly {{higher than in the}} openings between trees. The density of moss mats, proportion between leaves and stems were calculated. It was revealed that climatic factors have a different degree and duration influence on the moss increments in different habitats. Linear increments of H. splendens in different habitats synchronously respond to weather factor changes. The air temperature was the most important at {{the beginning and the end}} of the vegetation period; the amount of precipitation was more important in the middle of the growth period. Phytomass increments of H. splendens in different habitats respond differently to influence of weather conditions. Phytomass increments under the tree canopy are not sensitive to air temperature, and more sensitive to precipitations in the middle of growth period than one of opening between trees. The specificity of the climatic factors’ influence on the biomass growth depends on habitat conditions...|$|E
