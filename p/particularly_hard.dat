5|$|For {{wives and}} {{families}} of prisoners of war, life under the occupation was <b>particularly</b> <b>hard.</b> In pre-war France, the husband was generally the household's chief wage earner, so many households saw {{a sharp drop}} in income and living standards.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., about 28% of the {{population}} became infected, and 500,000 to 675,000 died. Native American tribes were <b>particularly</b> <b>hard</b> hit. In the Four Corners area alone, 3,293 deaths were registered among Native Americans. Entire village communities perished in Alaska. In Canada 50,000 died.|$|E
5|$|Adopted {{children}} are children that were given up at birth, abandoned or {{were unable to}} be cared for by their biological parents. They may have been put into foster care before finding their permanent residence. It is <b>particularly</b> <b>hard</b> for adopted children to get adopted from foster care: 50,000 children were adopted in 2001. The average age of these children was 7, which shows that fewer older children were adopted.|$|E

5|$|Native Americans in {{northern}} California suffered greatly {{at the hands}} of European-Americans in {{the last half of the}} 19th century, and their population decline is often characterized as genocide. The Wiyot people, who lived around Humboldt Bay, were <b>particularly</b> <b>hard</b> hit. Their population declined from about 1,500-2,000 in 1850 to about 200 in 1860.|$|E
5|$|A {{shipbuilding}} boom in {{the early}} part of the 20th century became massive during World War I, making Seattle somewhat of a company town; the subsequent retrenchment led to the Seattle General Strike of 1919, the first general strike in the country. A 1912 city development plan by Virgil Bogue went largely unused. Seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was <b>particularly</b> <b>hard</b> hit in the Great Depression, experiencing some of the country's harshest labor strife in that era. Violence during the Maritime Strike of 1934 cost Seattle much of its maritime traffic, which was rerouted to the Port of Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Betances {{returned}} to Puerto Rico in April 1856. At the time, a cholera epidemic was spreading across the island. The epidemic {{made its way}} to Puerto Rico's western coast in July 1856, and hit the city of Mayagüez <b>particularly</b> <b>hard.</b> At the time, Betances was one of five doctors that would {{have to take care of}} 24,000 residents. Both he and Dr. José Francisco Basora (who became lifelong friends and colleagues from that point on) would alert the city government and press the city managers into taking preventive action.|$|E
50|$|Within the Diablo II {{community}} {{the expansion}} caused some controversy when Blizzard patched the original game {{with an update}} that made Nightmare and Hell difficulties <b>particularly</b> <b>harder</b> than before; some players felt that Blizzard was effectively forcing them to upgrade to the expansion {{in order to find}} the items and gain the abilities necessary to deal with the new challenges.|$|R

50|$|<b>Particularly</b> <b>hardest</b> hit by {{economic}} problems were the industrial and mining {{areas in the}} north of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Unemployment reached 70% in some areas {{at the start of the}} 1930s (with more than 3 million out of work nationally) and many families depended entirely on payments from local government known as the dole. Politically the Conservative Party dominated the era and the Labour Party was seriously hurt.|$|R
5|$|High winds {{brought down}} {{telegraph}} wires {{and left the}} city almost entirely cut off from communication with outside locations. At Coney Island, the storm completely destroyed many buildings, walkways, piers, and beach resorts. Brighton Beach was hit <b>particularly</b> <b>hard.</b> The raging seas swept inland, washing out tracks of the Marine Railway. Bathing houses were moved a great distance by the cyclone. Near the Sheepshead Bay, Emmons Avenue was heavily damaged. Further to the east, at Greenport, numerous yachts were wrecked and scattered. Corn crops on land were ruined and fruit trees lost their fruits.|$|E
5|$|Life in {{proximity}} to humans and other domestic animals {{has led to}} a symbiotic social adaptation in cats, and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animals. Ethologically, the human keeper of a cat may function as a sort of surrogate for the cat's mother, and adult housecats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny. The high-pitched sounds housecats make to solicit food may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them <b>particularly</b> <b>hard</b> for humans to ignore.|$|E
5|$|Engineers laid {{wire mesh}} on the beaches, felled trees, built roads and {{established}} supply dumps. While the LSTs were unloaded quickly enough, the seven bulk loaded LCTs were not, due to insufficient troops being designated to help unloading. The last was not unloaded until 14:30. At 13:00, six LSTs heading for Red Beach {{were attacked by}} a force of about 70 Japanese aircraft. Some 48 Lockheed P-38 Lightnings were vectored to assist. USS LST-473 was rocked by two bomb hits and two near misses from Val dive bombers. Eight Americans were killed and 37 Americans and Australians wounded. USS LST-471 was torpedoed {{on the port side}} aft by a Betty bomber; 43 Americans and Australians were killed and 30 were wounded. <b>Particularly</b> <b>hard</b> hit were the commandos of the 2/4th Independent Company, which lost 34 dead and 7 wounded.|$|E
50|$|Shovell's action brought Tourville's ships {{under fire}} from both sides; Soleil Royal <b>particularly</b> was <b>hard</b> pressed until Coetlogon, with Magnifique 86 (Blue 3) and Prince 56 (blue 2) interposed.|$|R

50|$|<b>Particularly</b> <b>hardest</b> hit {{were the}} north of England and Wales, where {{unemployment}} reached 70% in some areas. The General Strike was called during 1926 {{in support of the}} miners and their falling wages, but it failed. The strike market the start of the slow decline of the British coal industry. In 1936 two hundred unemployed men walked from Jarrow to London in a bid to show the plight of the industrial poor, but the Jarrow March, had little impact and it was not until 1940 that industrial prospects improved. George Orwell's book The Road to Wigan Pier gives a bleak overview of the hardships of the time.|$|R
5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, {{preparations}} were extensive; residents boarded up homes and businesses, while evacuations were recommended in some coastal areas. In the Bahamas, where winds reached , the storm killed three people. The city of Nassau was struck <b>particularly</b> <b>hard.</b> In Florida, damage was relatively severe, and included the deaths of several people. High winds brought down trees and power lines, though the storm was characterized by highly unusual rainfall patterns. In the Everglades region, a storm surge flooded local streets. As the storm progressed northward, the city of Tallahassee suffered widespread power outages and damage to numerous vehicles. Throughout the state, the hurricane inflicted $675,000 USD ($ 2011 USD) in damage. The cyclone later killed one person in Georgia.|$|E
5|$|New York City {{was struck}} <b>particularly</b> <b>hard</b> by the storm. It is {{estimated}} that 42 people perished, and several hundred more people were injured. The storm disrupted the city for days, and forced schools to close. Streets throughout Queens became impassable; mail service, buses, taxis, delivery vehicles, and trash collection were all disrupted. Thousands of motorists became trapped on the New York State Thruway. A snow emergency was issued in the city, and the Long Island Rail Road suspended all service at the time. The snowstorm left approximately 6,000 travelers stranded at Kennedy Airport. They slept on chairs and floors. Over 1,000 vehicles were stalled or abandoned on the Tappan Zee Bridge; most of these were removed within a day.|$|E
5|$|On June 10, a {{powerful}} squall line of thunderstorms with embedded supercells developed across New York and moved northeast through parts of northern New England and Quebec. <b>Particularly</b> <b>hard</b> hit was the Montreal region and its southern suburbs including Longueuil, Châteauguay, Brossard and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. Barns were reported damaged and other structures sustained roof and siding damage; {{particularly in the}} Saint-Blaise-sur-Richelieu area where one home was pushed from its foundation. In Sainte-Catherine, the roof of an office was blown into a nearby residence punching a large hole on the back wall. On Montreal's Champlain Bridge, eight tractor trailers were overturned forcing {{the closure of the}} entire bridge in both directions. In addition, a window washing platform tumbled from a high rise building in downtown Montreal. The workers were able to get inside.|$|E

30|$|A trade {{model by}} Egger and Kreckmeire (2009) relies on workers’ {{preference}} for a “fair” wage, which is tied to firm performance. Trade openness under this assumption leads to wage inequality as wages rise significantly in highly productive firms that enter into export markets. Non-export firms face stiff competition from imported final goods while experiencing pressure {{to keep up with}} high wages in export firms. Unemployment in the Egger and Kreckmeire (2009) model increases because the combined effect reduces profit margins of non-export firms forcing them to either cut jobs or exit the market. Davis and Harringa (2011) add an efficiency wage argument to a Melitz-type model where large firms pay higher than the market-clearing wage to elicit effort from their workers as it is <b>particularly</b> <b>harder</b> to monitor effort in large firms. While Davis and Harringa (2011) predict a rise in unemployment rate following trade openness, it is expected to be moderate as compared to the volume of job reallocation across firms.|$|R
5|$|Preparations for {{the storm}} were extensive; {{residents}} boarded up homes and businesses, while evacuations were recommended in some coastal areas. In the Bahamas, where winds reached , the storm killed three people. The city of Nassau was struck <b>particularly</b> <b>hard,</b> though damage elsewhere in the islands was also severe, with many homes reported destroyed. In Florida, damage was relatively severe, and included the deaths of several people. High winds brought down trees and power lines, and wind-driven salt water damaged vegetation well inland across Dade County, though the storm was characterized by unusually light rainfall. Storm surge in the Everglades region flooded local streets, particularly at Everglades City. As the storm progressed northward, the city of Tallahassee suffered widespread power outages and damage to numerous vehicles. Throughout the state, the hurricane inflicted $675,000 (1941USD) in damages. The cyclone later killed one person in Georgia.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch were ill-prepared {{to resist}} such an invasion. When Hitler came to power, the Dutch {{had begun to}} re-arm, but more slowly than France or Belgium; only in 1936 did the defence budget start to be {{gradually}} increased. Successive Dutch governments tended to avoid openly identifying Germany as an acute military threat. Partly this {{was caused by a}} wish not to antagonise a vital trade partner, {{even to the point of}} repressing criticism of Nazi policies; partly it was made inevitable by a policy of strict budgetary limits with which the conservative Dutch governments tried in vain to fight the Great Depression, which hit Dutch society <b>particularly</b> <b>hard.</b> Hendrikus Colijn, prime minister between 1933 and 1939, was personally convinced Germany would not violate Dutch neutrality; senior officers made no effort to mobilise public opinion in favour of improving military defence.|$|E
5|$|The First World War hit {{the slate}} {{industry}} badly, particularly in Blaenau Ffestiniog where exports to Germany {{had been an}} important source of income. Cilgwyn, the oldest quarry in Wales, closed in 1914, though it later reopened. In 1917, slate quarrying was declared a non-essential industry and a number of quarries were closed {{for the remainder of the}} war. The demand for new houses after the end of the war brought back a measure of prosperity; in the slate mines of Blaenau Ffestiniog production was almost back to 1913 levels by 1927, but in the quarries the output was still well below the pre-war level. The Great Depression in the 1930s led to cuts in production, with exports <b>particularly</b> <b>hard</b> hit.|$|E

5|$|A complete, consistent, hardworking and {{versatile}} midfielder, Alonso {{is regarded as}} one of the best players of his generation, and is effective both creatively and defensively. Gifted with good technique, excellent vision, and varied passing range, he excels in the centre in a deep-lying playmaking role, where he can best use his accurate long passing ability to create goal scoring chances for teammates; he also possesses a powerful and accurate shot from distance, and he is an effective set-piece and penalty kick taker. Due to his height, positioning, and physical characteristics, Xabi Alonso is also effective in the air, often contributing with headed goals from set pieces when advancing into more offensive positions. In addition to his creative attributes, he is also capable of excelling as a defensive midfielder due to his strength and powerful physique, combined with his tenacity, tactical intelligence, aggressive tackling and his ability to read the game. He has at times been criticised, however, for occasionally committing rash challenges and for his tendency to lose his composure and pick up unnecessary cards for <b>particularly</b> <b>hard</b> fouls.|$|E
5|$|Beetles {{typically}} have a <b>particularly</b> <b>hard</b> exoskeleton including the elytra, though {{some such as}} the rove beetles have very short elytra while blister beetles have softer elytra. The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform and typical of insects, although there are several examples of novelty, such as adaptations in water beetles which trap air bubbles under the elytra for use while diving. Beetles are endopterygotes, {{which means that they}} undergo complete metamorphosis, with a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes in body structure between hatching and becoming adult after a relatively immobile pupal stage. Some, such as stag beetles, have a marked sexual dimorphism, the males possessing enormously enlarged mandibles which they use to fight other males. Many beetles are aposematic, with bright colours and patterns warning of their toxicity, while others are harmless Batesian mimics of such insects. Many beetles, including those that live in sandy places, have effective camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Farm incomes {{have fallen}} {{over the years}} as a result of cheap food {{policies}} in the United Kingdom, the lowering of world commodity prices and the removal of production-based subsidies. <b>Particularly</b> <b>hard</b> hit have been the incomes of hill farms in Wales which averaged £15,000 in 2014, as against £23,000 for lowland livestock farms and £59,000 for dairy farms. The labour force has been dwindling for many years as a result of increased mechanisation and changes in farming practices. Fewer farmers are needed today because they are able to produce more food from their land. Hay is no longer the main source of winter feed for livestock and has largely been replaced by silage, particularly baled silage wrapped in film that can be handled mechanically. This has reduced the manpower needed on farms, and there has been an increase of use by farmers of specialised contractors who provide services in silage making, harvesting and fencing. Another problem facing Welsh farmers is their distance from the main distribution centres used by supermarkets which are mostly located near centres of population in England.|$|E
