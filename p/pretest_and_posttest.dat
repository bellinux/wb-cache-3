However, Monte Carlo studies, and subsequent asymptotic studies found that the rank transformation is inappropriate for testing interaction effects in a 4x3 and a 2x2x2 factorial design. As the number of effects (i.e., main, interaction) become non-null, and as {{the magnitude of the}} non-null effects increase, there is an increase in Type I error, resulting in a complete failure of the statistic with as high as a 100% probability of making a false positive decision. Similarly, {{it was found that the}} rank transformation increasingly fails in the two dependent samples layout as the correlation between <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> <b>posttest</b> scores increase.

Some type of memory dysfunction could be treated by training; therefore this study was carried out {{with the aim of}} assessing the effect of musical activities on the memory of patients with schizophrenia. Materials and Methods: 56 patients, who were members of Iranian Association of Patients with Schizophrenia, randomly divided into two groups of 30 intervention groups and 26 control groups. The experimental group took part in 24 music therapy sessions. Memory scores were gathered using Wexler memory test and backward counting test board in the <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> <b>post</b> test stages. Results: There was a significance difference in Post-test of Wexler memory test in both experimental and control groups. In control group, there was a slight increase in memory scores (P= 0. 002), however, this increase was greater in the intervention group (P= 0. 0001).

The p values resulting from both tests (all ps < . 001) disproved the notion of one uniform (prior instruction-independent) Rasch model. The item-specific Wald test and the graphical model test, with 95 % confidence regions, indicated that particularly for one item (item 2 “Book”), parameter estimations differed markedly (p < . 001) between <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> <b>posttest.</b> This item, which addresses normal force {{and its effect on}} a book lying on a table, was difficult for all of the students to solve correctly without instruction, but it was easy to solve correctly after instruction. In their everyday lives, students usually do not consciously recognize phenomena related to normal force. Without being introduced to this type of force in physics instruction, most students seem to have no idea about it. After this item was excluded, Andersen’s conditional likelihood ratio test and the non-parametric T 10 -statistic suggested conformity in the item parameter estimations between <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> <b>posttest</b> (all ps ≥ . 10). With the exception of item 2 (“Book”), the test therefore measures conceptual understanding of basic Newtonian mechanics on the same scale, or on the same latent dimension, for <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> <b>posttest</b> data. Consequently, changes between <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> <b>posttest</b> should be assessed with the 11 -item version of the bMCU test.

This study is an quasy experimental design by nonrandomized pretest-posttest control group design conducted in the department of Biology in State University of Malang in 2015. The data was collected from <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> <b>posttest.</b> The result showed that there was significant influence of critical thinking skills on general Biology among Socio-Biological Case Based Learning and conventional model. The average difference in conventional model for <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> <b>posttest</b> is 18, 21 while in Socio-Biological Case Based Learning is 36, 92. Based on gain score, the increase in conventional model is 62, 80 % while Socio-Biological Case Based Learning model is 74, 03 %...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study of student {{understanding}} of induced EMF. Students enrolled in a physics lab course completed a <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> <b>posttest</b> that included questions about induced EMF. Following the posttest, some of those students participated in interviews in which they elaborated on their ideas. <b>Pretest</b> <b>and</b> <b>posttest</b> data are presented in the article, as well as sample interview text. After instruction in the lab course, most {{students were able to}} identify that moving a magnet near a coil would induce a current. However, nearly half were unable to correctly determine the direction of the induced current. Many students also demonstrated difficulty with the idea that an EMF is induced by a changing magnetic flux, not just a changing magnetic field. Comment: 10 pages including appendi...|$|E

The students worked in groups to assemble information about the 2008 Economic Stimulus Plan. Assessment methods included <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> <b>posttest.</b> Results were improvement in the posttest scores and dynamic interpersonal interactions...|$|E

In these items, {{students were asked}} to draw a graph or to reproduce an equation that they viewed briefly. Students completed two equation-encoding items and two graph-encoding items at <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> at <b>posttest.</b>|$|R
40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{the development of}} instruction to address identified difficulties students have in introductory physics courses. Tests were designed to investigate students 2 ̆ 7 conceptual understanding and use of mathematical tools in an electromagnetism context, and students {{understanding of the relationship}} between position, velocity, and acceleration, and the graphing of these quantities with time in the context of simple harmonic motion. The resulting instruction specifically tackles difficulties discovered after initial testing, and takes the form of structured worksheets which students complete in small groups, with tutors acting as facilitators. Through the comparison of students answers to <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> <b>post</b> test questions the effectiveness of the developed instruction has been assessed...|$|R
40|$|Climate Change is a technology-supported {{middle school}} science inquiry {{curriculum}}. This curriculum focuses on essential climate literacy principles {{with an emphasis}} on weather and climate, Earth system energy balance, greenhouse gases, paleoclimatology, and how human activities influence climate change. Students use geospatial information technology tools (Google Earth), Web-based tools (including an interactive carbon calculator and geologic timeline), and inquiry-based lab activities to investigate important climate change topics. Climate Change is aligned to the Essential Principles of Climate Literacy in addition to national science and environmental education standards. The unit takes 21 days which include <b>pretest</b> <b>and</b> <b>post</b> test.
