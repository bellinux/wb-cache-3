50|$|Among {{healthcare}} consumers—i.e., patients—satisfaction is {{best understood}} as a multi-attribute model with different aspects of care determining overall satisfaction. Importantly, lower <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> an attribute creates much more dissatisfaction than the satisfaction generated by higher <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> an attribute; in other words, negative performance is more consequential than positive performance. Thus, ensuring overall patient satisfaction, {{it is more important}} reduce negative <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> the patient-care dimension with the worst perceived performance than to maximize positive <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> another dimension. A fruitful solution can be measuring patient dissatisfaction instead of satisfaction.|$|R
5|$|Dartmouth is {{well known}} for its variety of long-standing student traditions, many of which are {{centered}} on the Green. At Homecoming each fall, a bonfire is constructed on the Green by the freshman class; students and community members gather to watch the freshmen run around it as it burns. The wintertime celebration of Winter Carnival sees the construction of a snow sculpture on the Green. In the springtime, Green Key Weekend is marked by concerts and <b>performances</b> <b>on</b> the Green, which until 1984 was also the site of fiercely competitive Green Key chariot races.|$|E

50|$|In his distraction-conflict hypothesis, Robert Baron {{proposed}} {{that the level of}} <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> a task is predicted by the amount of distractions in the environment surrounding the task. The hypothesis states that distraction leads to arousal, so the presence of others always impedes <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> difficult tasks, but the number of distractions in the environment either improves or impedes the <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> simple tasks.|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the claim that}} correct <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> unexpected transfer false-belief tasks specifically involves mental-state understanding, two experiments were carried out with children with autism, intellectual disabilities, and typical development. In both experiments, children were given a standard unexpected transfer false-belief task and a mental-state-free, mechanical analogue task in which participants had to predict the destination of a train based on true or false signal information. In both experiments, <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> the mechanical task was found to correlate with that on the false-belief task for all groups of children. Logistic regression showed that <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> the mechanical analogue significantly predicted <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> the false-belief task even after accounting {{for the effects of}} verbal mental age. The findings are discussed in relation to possible common mechanisms underlying correct <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> the two tasks...|$|R

5|$|Allen Lanier, Joe Bouchard and Donald Roeser contributed {{instrumental}} {{parts and}} backing vocals to the tracks as guests. These remain Lanier's and J. Bouchard's only contributions to Imaginos. Columbia Records' complaints about Albert Bouchard's lead vocals pushed him to finance multiple recordings with try-outs of singers, including Jon Rogers and Joey Cerisano, whose <b>performances</b> <b>on</b> some songs {{were used for}} the final mix of the album in 1988. The new recordings, overdubs by other uncredited musicians, and mixing lasted until 1984. Musicians involved in this second phase of recording included future BÖC keyboard player Tommy Zvoncheck, who had already played with Clarence Clemons, Public Image Ltd and The Dream Syndicate.|$|E
40|$|Adolescents {{demonstrate}} impaired decision-making in emotionally arousing situations, {{yet they}} appear to exhibit relatively mature decision-making skills in predominately cognitive, low-arousal situations. In this study we compared adolescents’ (13 - 15 years) <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> matched affective and cognitive decision-making tasks, {{in order to determine}} (1) their <b>performance</b> level <b>on</b> each task and (2) whether <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> the cognitive task was associated with <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> the affective task. Both tasks required a comparison of choice dimensions characterized by frequency of loss, amount of loss, and constant gain. Results indicated that in the affective task, adolescents performed suboptimally by considering only the frequency of loss, whereas in the cognitive task adolescents used relatively mature decision rules by considering two or all three choice dimensions. <b>Performance</b> <b>on</b> the affective task was not related to <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> the cognitive task.

40|$|Background: The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the prevalence of neurocognitive impairment among HIV-positive individuals in Botswana, using the International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS). We also compared <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> the IHDS with <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> tests of verbal learning/memory and processing speed, and investigated the association between <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> the IHDS and such variables as depression, age, level of education and CD 4 count. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 120 HIV-positive individuals randomly selected from an outpatient HIV clinic in Gaborone, Botswana. Patients provided a detailed clinical history and underwent neuropsychological testing; measures of depression, daily activities and subjective cognitive complaints were recorded. Results: Despite the fact that 97. 5 % of subjects were receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), 38 % met criteria for dementia on the IHDS, and 24 % were diagnosed with major depressive disorder. There was a significant association between neurocognitive impairment as measured by the IHDS and <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> the other two cognitive measures of verbal learning/memory and processing speed. Level of education significantly affected <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> all three cognitive measures, and age affected processing speed and <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> the IHDS.

5|$|Booth was {{selected}} for the New South Wales hockey team in 1955 and toured New Zealand in 1956. Good <b>performances</b> <b>on</b> this tour led to his selection in the Australian Olympic squad for the 1956 Summer Olympics, but he had an anxious wait following media claims that he had received out of pocket expenses for playing cricket, which would make him a professional and therefore ineligible {{to participate in the}} Olympics. Eventually, Booth and fellow first-class cricketers Ian Dick and Maurice Foley were cleared to play for Australia. Booth then missed the 195657 Sheffield Shield season because {{he was part of the}} Australian field hockey team that finished fifth at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. Booth {{was selected}} as an inside left, but was not utilised in any of Australia's matches. In his absence, New South Wales won a fourth consecutive domestic title.|$|E
5|$|Cedar Lane Cinema {{had been}} the township's lone movie theater, and had also hosted live <b>{{performance}}s</b> <b>on</b> its stage by local performance groups, until it closed its doors in November 2012, with theater operator Majestic Entertainment citing costs that could run {{to as much as}} $500,000 to modernize the projection systems on all four screens to use digital technology rather than 35mm reels of film. New owner Matthew Latten signed a lease in April 2013 and undertook extensive renovations that included new seating, modern digital projection systems and digital signage. After hosting the Teaneck International Film Festival in November, the reopening of the renamed Teaneck Cineams was delayed until December 2013, with added time needed to complete the work needed to add modern features and conveniences while retaining the Art Deco character of a theater first constructed in 1937.|$|E
30|$|The {{finding of}} the Demakis [4] meta-analysis, that the WCST was not {{sensitive}} to lateralized frontal lobe dysfunction, {{is not surprising}} given the equivocal findings that have been reported. Whereas <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> the WCST is sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction [5, 6], demonstration of lateralized frontal dysfunction has been quite problematic. Unilateral left or right dorsolateral frontal dysfunction {{has been associated with}} impaired <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> the WCST [6]. Fallgatter and Strik [7] found bilateral frontal lobe activation during performance of the WCST. However, other imaging studies have found right lateralized frontal lobe activation [8] and left lateralized frontal activation [9] in response to <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> the WCST. Further, left frontal lobe alpha power is negatively correlated with <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> the WCST [10]. Finally, patients with left frontal lobe tumors exhibit more impaired <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> the WCST than those with right frontal tumors [11].|$|R
40|$|Differences in <b>performance</b> <b>on,</b> and {{preference}} for, different {{plant parts}} were studied on cucumber plants.

We assessed if differences in suitability of leaves of different age could explain the distribution of thrips on cucumber plants. Evidence was obtained for a correlation between preference and <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> cucumber leaves of different age. Differences in <b>performance</b> <b>on,</b> and preference for, different host plant species were studied with selected isofemale lines.

5|$|Chambers {{lamented the}} effects of his drug use and noted the irony that the drugs did not do much to improve the {{consistency}} of his <b>performances.</b> <b>On</b> his return to international competition his times were significantly worse than he achieved prior to drug use: in the 100m final at the 2006 European Championships, Chambers ran a sub-par 10.24s and finished in fifth place. He {{was part of the}} gold medal-winning British 4×100m team, but Darren Campbell, who was angry about losing his 2002 and 2003 relay medals due to Chambers' ban, refused to join the team in a celebratory lap. After the competition, Chambers again expressed an interest in switching to American football and completed a week-long NFL Europa training camp in Cologne that November.|$|E
