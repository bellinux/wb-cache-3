The researcher wanted to determine whether specific combinations of color and images on wine labels reflect greater aesthetic content and relate to their recommended price. Fifty wine labels {{were randomly selected from}} a given sample and several researchers evaluated each label looking specifically at the design elements listed above. A regression analysis was performed to determine if there was an overall relationship between <b>price</b> <b>and</b> all of the variables.

It summarizes microeconomic data on <b>price</b> <b>and</b> wage setting behavior, and argues that staggered <b>price</b> <b>and</b> wage setting models provide the most satisfactory match with the data. Research in this area has been very active in the 1990 's with a remarkable number of studies using, estimating, or testing models of staggered <b>price</b> <b>and</b> wage setting. A new generation of econometric models incorporating staggered <b>price</b> <b>and</b> wage setting with rational expectations has been built. Researchers have begun to incorporate staggered wage <b>and</b> <b>price</b> setting into real business cycle models. Close links have been discovered between the parameters of people's utility functions and the parameters of <b>price</b> <b>and</b> wage setting equations. There is now a debate about whether standard calibrations of utility functions prevent staggered price models, at least those with frequent price changes, from explaining long persistence of real output.
