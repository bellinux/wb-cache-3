25|$|Many {{species of}} Passiflora {{have been found}} to contain beta-carboline harmala {{alkaloids}}, some of which are MAO inhibitors. The flower and fruit have only traces of these chemicals, but the leaves and the roots often contain more. The most common of these alkaloids is harman, but harmaline, harmalol, harmine, and harmol are also present. The species known to bear such alkaloids include: P. actinea, P. alata (winged-stem <b>passion</b> <b>flower),</b> P. alba, P. bryonioides (cupped <b>passion</b> <b>flower),</b> P. caerulea (blue <b>passion</b> <b>flower),</b> P. capsularis, P. decaisneana, P. edulis (passion fruit), P. eichleriana, P. foetida (stinking <b>passion</b> <b>flower),</b> P. incarnata (maypop), P. quadrangularis (giant granadilla), P. suberosa, P. subpeltata and P. warmingii.|$|E
25|$|During the Victorian era {{the flower}} (which {{in all but}} a few species lasts only one day) was very popular, and many hybrids were created using the winged-stem <b>passion</b> <b>flower</b> (P. alata), the blue <b>passion</b> <b>flower</b> (P. caerulea) and other {{tropical}} species.|$|E
25|$|The bracts of the stinking <b>passion</b> <b>flower</b> {{are covered}} by hairs which exude a sticky fluid. Many small insects get stuck to this and get digested to nutrient-rich goo by proteases and acid phosphatases. Since the insects usually killed are rarely major pests, this <b>passion</b> <b>flower</b> {{seems to be a}} protocarnivorous plant.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some species are {{endangered}} due to unsustainable logging {{and other forms}} of habitat destruction. For example, the Chilean <b>passion</b> <b>flower</b> (P. pinnatistipula) is a rare vine growing in the Andes from Venezuela to Chile between 2,500 and 3,800 meters altitude, and in Coastal Central Chile, where it occurs in woody Chilean Mediterranean forests. P. pinnatistipula has a round fruit, unusual in Tacsonia group species like banana <b>passion</b> <b>flower</b> and P. mixta, with their elongated tubes and brightly red to rose-colored petals.|$|E
25|$|Yellow <b>passion</b> <b>flower</b> (P. lutea) pollen is {{apparently}} the only pollen eaten by the unusual bee Anthemurgus passiflorae. However, these bees simply collect the pollen, {{but do not}} pollinate the flowers.|$|E
25|$|Passion flowers {{have been}} a subject of studies {{investigating}} extranuclear inheritance; paternal inheritance of chloroplast DNA has been documented in this genus. The plastome of the two-flowered <b>passion</b> <b>flower</b> (P. biflora) has been sequenced.|$|E
25|$|Passiflora, known also as the <b>passion</b> <b>flowers</b> or <b>passion</b> vines, is a genus {{of about}} 500 species of {{flowering}} plants, the type genus {{of the family}} Passifloraceae.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>passion</b> <b>flowers</b> have {{a unique}} [...] structure, which in most cases {{requires}} a large bee to effectively pollinate. In the American tropics, wooden beams are mounted very near passionfruit plantings to encourage carpenter bees to nest. The size and structure of flowers of other Passiflora species is optimized for pollination by hummingbirds (especially hermits like Phaethornis), bumble bees, Carpenter bees (Xylocopa varipuncta), wasps or bats, while others are self-pollinating. The sword-billed hummingbird (Ensifera ensifera) with its immensely elongated bill has co-evolved with certain <b>passion</b> <b>flowers,</b> such as P. mixta.|$|R
2500|$|The {{leaves are}} used as food plants by the larva {{of a number of}} lepidoptera. [...] To prevent the {{butterflies}} from laying too many eggs on any single plant, some <b>passion</b> <b>flowers</b> bear small colored nubs which resemble the butterflies' eggs and seem to fool them into believing that more eggs have already been deposited on a plant than actually is the case. Also, many Passiflora species produce sweet nutrient-rich liquid from glands on their leaf stems. These fluids attract ants which will kill and eat many pests that they happen to find feeding on the <b>passion</b> <b>flowers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Some {{species of}} Passiflora have been naturalised beyond their native ranges. For example, blue <b>passion</b> <b>flower</b> (P. caerulea) now grows wild in Spain. The purple passionfruit (P. edulis) and its yellow {{relative}} flavicarpa {{have been introduced}} in many tropical regions as commercial crops.|$|E
25|$|Many cool-growing Passiflora {{from the}} Andes Mountains {{can be grown}} {{successfully}} for their beautiful flowers and fruit in cooler Mediterranean climates, such as the Monterey Bay and San Francisco in California and along the western coast of the U.S. into Canada. One blue <b>passion</b> <b>flower</b> or hybrid even grew to large size at Malm√∂ Central Station in Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Other {{compounds}} {{found in}} passion flowers are coumarins (e.g. scopoletin and umbelliferone), maltol, phytosterols (e.g. lutenin) and cyanogenic glycosides (e.g. gynocardin) which render some species, i.e. P. adenopoda, somewhat poisonous. Many flavonoids and their glycosides {{have been found}} in Passiflora, including apigenin, benzoflavone, homoorientin, 7-isoorientin, isoshaftoside, isovitexin (or saponaretin), kaempferol, lucenin, luteolin, n-orientin, passiflorine (named after the genus), quercetin, rutin, saponarin, shaftoside, vicenin and vitexin. Maypop, blue <b>passion</b> <b>flower</b> (P. caerulea), and perhaps others contain the flavone chrysin. Also documented to occur at least in some Passiflora in quantity are the hydrocarbon nonacosane and the anthocyanidin pelargonidin-3-diglycoside.|$|E

500|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey {{is an important}} seed disperser and a pollinator of certain flowers, including the <b>passion</b> <b>flower.</b> [...] While {{it is not a}} significant agricultural pest, it does sometimes eat corn, coffee, bananas and mangos. [...] Other fruits eaten include cecropias, legumes, figs, palms, cerillo, quiubra, yayo flaco and wild cashew fruits.|$|E
500|$|The 1880s Seddon high altar has a fine reredos {{across the}} east wall in red {{sandstone}} and white marble. There is red stone outer wall-panelling in squares of rose and vine, in a moulded frame. A white marble shelf or Retable on brackets over pink marble framing {{is behind the}} altar, with outer panels of white marble with a cross on vine background. The frame is stepped over the main reredos. Five white marble inner panels are separated by short half-octagonal red stone columns. There are Alpha and Omega symbols at each end and three long panels, two of vine and a centre <b>passion</b> <b>flower.</b> Above these latter three are three white marble lettered panels, two with [...] "Laus Deo" [...] ("Praise be to God"), and the centre with [...] "Gloria in excelsis Deo" [...] ("Glory to God in the highest"), also red stone framed.|$|E

2500|$|Banana <b>passion</b> <b>flower</b> or [...] "banana poka" [...] (P. tarminiana), {{originally}} from Central Brazil, is an invasive weed, {{especially on the}} islands of Hawaii. It is commonly spread by feral pigs eating the fruits. It overgrows and smothers stands of endemic vegetation, mainly on roadsides. Blue <b>passion</b> <b>flower</b> (P. caerulea) is holding its own in Spain these days, and it probably needs to be watched so that unwanted spreading can be curtailed.|$|E
2500|$|An iris [...] species {{unspecified}} [...] {{is one of}} {{the state}} flowers of Tennessee. Tradition holds that the particular iris symbolizing Tennessee is a purple cultivar, to go alongside the wild-growing Purple <b>Passion</b> <b>Flower</b> (Passiflora incarnata), which is the state's other floral emblem.

5|$|Some plants {{mimic the}} {{presence}} of insect eggs on their leaves, dissuading insect species from laying their eggs there. Because female butterflies {{are less likely to}} lay their eggs on plants that already have butterfly eggs, some species of neotropical vines of the genus Passiflora (<b>Passion</b> <b>flowers)</b> contain physical structures resembling the yellow eggs of Heliconius butterflies on their leaves, which discourage oviposition by butterflies.|$|R
