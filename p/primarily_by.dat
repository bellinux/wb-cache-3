5|$|The {{long-lived}} isotopes,146Sm, 147Sm, and 148Sm, <b>primarily</b> decay <b>by</b> {{emission of}} alpha particles to isotopes of neodymium. Lighter unstable isotopes of samarium <b>primarily</b> decay <b>by</b> electron capture to isotopes of promethium, while heavier ones convert through beta decay to isotopes of europium.|$|R

5|$|Twenty-nine radioisotopes {{have also}} been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 138 to 173. The most stable of these is 154Dy, with a {{half-life}} of approximately 3years, followed by 159Dy with a half-life of 144.4days. The least stable is 138Dy, with a half-life of 200ms. As a general rule, isotopes that are lighter than the stable isotopes tend to decay <b>primarily</b> <b>by</b> β+ decay, while those that are heavier tend to decay by β− decay. However, 154Dy decays <b>primarily</b> <b>by</b> alpha decay, and 152Dy and 159Dy decay <b>primarily</b> <b>by</b> electron capture. Dysprosium also has at least 11 metastable isomers, ranging in atomic mass from 140 to 165. The most stable of these is 165mDy, which has a half-life of 1.257minutes. 149Dy has two metastable isomers, the second of which, 149m2Dy, has a half-life of 28ns.|$|E
5|$|Yttrium {{isotopes}} {{with mass}} numbers {{at or below}} 88 decay <b>primarily</b> <b>by</b> positron emission (proton → neutron) to form strontium (Z = 38) isotopes. Yttrium isotopes with mass numbers at or above 90 decay <b>primarily</b> <b>by</b> electron emission (neutron → proton) to form zirconium (Z = 40) isotopes. Isotopes with mass numbers at or above 97 are also known to have minor decay paths of β− delayed neutron emission.|$|E

5|$|Andrés Torrón of El Observador noted a {{similarity}} between Almendra and Pink Floyd's 1967 album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Almendra lyrics (<b>primarily</b> <b>by</b> Spinetta) {{have been widely}} studied for their lyricism, poetic quality, precise use of language, and rich visual imagery; {{as well as the}} innovation of singing them in Spanish.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{migration}} is the regular seasonal movement, often {{north and south}} along a flyway, between breeding and wintering grounds. Many species of bird migrate. Migration carries high costs in predation and mortality, including from hunting by humans, and is driven <b>primarily</b> <b>by</b> availability of food. It occurs mainly in the northern hemisphere, where birds are funnelled on to specific routes by natural barriers such as the Mediterranean Sea or the Caribbean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Box {{lacrosse}} is {{the most}} popular version of the sport in the Czech Republic. It is also played to a marginal degree in Australia, <b>primarily</b> <b>by</b> players who have played field lacrosse.

5|$|Catalytic {{variants}} employing stoichiometric diallylcarbonate {{and other}} allylic carbonates {{have also been}} developed, <b>primarily</b> <b>by</b> Jiro Tsuji.
