5|$|The {{experiment}} {{had previously}} been considered, but rejected, by Isaac Newton as a <b>practical</b> <b>demonstration</b> of his theory of gravitation. However, a team of scientists, notably Nevil Maskelyne, the Astronomer Royal, {{was convinced that the}} effect would be detectable and undertook to conduct the experiment. The deflection angle depended on the relative densities and volumes of the Earth and the mountain: if the density and volume of Schiehallion could be ascertained, then so could the density of the Earth. Once this was known, then this would in turn yield approximate values for those of the other planets, their moons, and the Sun, previously known only in terms of their relative ratios. As an additional benefit, the concept of contour lines, devised to simplify the process of surveying the mountain, later became a standard technique in cartography.|$|E

25|$|While {{small in}} scale, the Battle of Hamel {{was to have}} {{far-reaching}} consequences for trench warfare, because, like the Battle of Cambrai in 1917, it provided a <b>practical</b> <b>demonstration</b> of tactics for attacking an entrenched enemy using combined arms tactics. The strategy employed at Hamel was then successful on a much larger scale in the Battle of Amiens and was {{a major factor in}} Allied successes later in the war. The result received strong praise from French Premier Georges Clemenceau, who later toured the battlefield and addressed the troops that had taken part. Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, the World War II British army commander, later described Monash as the best World War I general on the Western Front in Europe.|$|E
25|$|On the {{philosophy}} behind {{the process of}} reservation itself, the people in favour of reservation feel that reservation is necessary to undo and counter the 'evils' of centuries of caste system that prevailed in the country. Reservation proponents also contend that merit as it is defined today {{is something that is}} achieved with the help of cramming, tutoring, constant guidance, quality schooling and knowledge of English and poor Dalits, poor MBC's lack most of these. This (the argument cnetering on cramming, tutoring, etc.) the anti-reservationists do not accept, pointing out that not all high-scorers at the exams can hope to eventually succeed in translating their knowledge into skills, but low-scorers especially in higher education will also score badly on the skill ladder proportionately much more than high-scorers. They also suggest that the examination-based approach to merit evaluation calls for a modification to better reflect meritorious performance in <b>practical</b> <b>demonstration</b> of skills, but casteist reservation does not have anything to offer as a solution in this regard. Which, they add, only goes to expose the foul game of the politicians of India many of whom have a record of strongly alleged offences and crimes of numerous types.|$|E

500|$|Wright {{helped the}} {{mathematician}} and globe maker Emery Molyneux to plot coastlines on his terrestrial globe, and translated {{some of the}} explanatory legends into Latin. Molyneux's terrestrial and celestial globes, {{the first to be}} manufactured in England, were published in late 1592 or early 1593, and Wright explained their use in his 1599 work Certaine Errors in Navigation. He dedicated the book to Cumberland, to whom he had presented a manuscript of the work in 1592, stating in the preface it was through Cumberland that he [...] "was first moved, and received maintenance to divert my mathematical studies, from a theorical speculation in the Universitie, to the <b>practical</b> <b>demonstration</b> of the use of Navigation".|$|E
500|$|Decades later, {{after the}} <b>practical</b> <b>demonstration</b> of motorjets and turbojets, Coandă {{began to tell}} various {{conflicting}} stories about how his early experiments were precursors to the jet, even that his turbo-propulseur was the first motorjet engine with fuel combustion in the airstream. He also claimed {{to have made a}} single brief flight in December 1910, crashing just after takeoff, the aircraft being destroyed by fire. Two aviation historians countered Coandă's version of events, saying there was no proof that the engine had combustion in the airstream, and no proof that the aircraft ever flew. In 1965, Coandă brought drawings forward to prove his claim of combustion ducting but these were shown to be reworked, differing substantially from the originals. Many aviation historians were dismissive, saying that Coandă's turbo-propulseur design involved a weak stream of [...] "plain air", not a powerful jet of air expanding from fuel combustion.|$|E

2500|$|Improperly banked road curves {{increase}} the risk of run-off-road and head-on crashes. A 2% deficiency in superelevation (say, 4% superelevation on a curve that should have 6%) can be expected to increase crash frequency by 6%, and a 5% deficiency will increase it by 15%. Up until now, highway engineers have been without efficient tools to identify improperly banked curves and to design relevant mitigating road actions. A modern profilograph can provide data of both road curvature and cross slope (angle of incline). A <b>practical</b> <b>demonstration</b> of how to evaluate improperly banked turns was developed in the EU Roadex III project. [...] See the linked referenced document below.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the same}} period two schemes of {{wireless}} signaling were put forward by William Henry Ward (1871) and Mahlon Loomis (1872) that {{were based on the}} erroneous belief that there was an electrified atmospheric stratum accessible at low altitude. Both inventors' patents noted this layer connected with a return path using [...] "Earth currents"' would allow for wireless telegraphy as well as supply power for the telegraph, doing away with artificial batteries, and could also be used for lighting, heat, and motive power. A more <b>practical</b> <b>demonstration</b> of wireless transmission via conduction came in Amos Dolbear's 1879 magneto electric telephone that used ground conduction to transmit over a distance of a quarter of a mile.|$|E

2500|$|While {{at school}} in London, White made one close friend, Ronald Waterall, an older boy who shared similar interests.

When Waterall left school, White withdrew again. He asked his parents if he could leave school to become an actor. The parents compromised and allowed him to finish school early if he came home to Australia to try life on the land. His parents felt that he should work on the land rather than become a writer and hoped that his work as a jackaroo would temper his artistic ambitions.|$|E

2500|$|A koan (literally [...] "public case") is a {{story or}} dialogue, {{generally}} related to Chan or other Buddhist history; the most typical form is an anecdote involving early Chinese Chan masters. These anecdotes involving famous Chan teachers are a <b>practical</b> <b>demonstration</b> of their wisdom, {{and can be used}} to test a student's progress in Chan practice. Koans often appear to be paradoxical or linguistically meaningless dialogues or questions. But to Chan Buddhists the koan is [...] "the place and the time and the event where truth reveals itself" [...] unobstructed by the oppositions and differentiations of language. Answering a koan requires a student to let go of conceptual thinking and of the logical way we order the world, so that, like creativity in art, the appropriate insight and response arises naturally and spontaneously in the mind.|$|E
2500|$|Campbell was {{struggling}} {{to set up a}} <b>practical</b> <b>demonstration</b> over a real telephone route with the budget he had been allocated. [...] After considering that his artificial line simulators used lumped components rather than the distributed quantities found in a real line, he wondered if he could not insert the inductance with lumped components instead of using Stone's distributed line. [...] When his calculations showed that the manholes on telephone routes were sufficiently close together to be able to insert the loading coils without the expense of either having to dig up the route or lay in new cables he changed to this new plan. [...] The very first demonstration of loading coils on a telephone cable was on a 46-mile length of the so-called Pittsburgh cable (the test was actually in Boston, the cable had previously been used for testing in Pittsburgh) on 6 September 1899 carried out by Campbell himself and his assistant. [...] The first telephone cable using loaded lines put into public service was between Jamaica Plain and West Newton in Boston on 18 May 1900.|$|E
2500|$|Transmission {{of color}} images using {{mechanical}} scanners had been conceived {{as early as}} the 1880s. A <b>practical</b> <b>demonstration</b> of mechanically-scanned color television was given by John Logie Baird in 1928, but the limitations of a mechanical system were apparent even then. Development of electronic scanning and display made an all-electronic system possible. [...] Early monochrome transmission standards were developed prior to the Second World War, but civilian electronics developments were frozen during much of the war. In August 1944, Baird gave the world's first demonstration of a practical fully electronic color television display. In the United States, commercially competing color standards were developed, finally resulting in the NTSC standard for color that retained compatibility with the prior monochrome system. Although the NTSC color standard was proclaimed in 1953 and limited programming became available, {{it was not until the}} early 1970's that color television in North American outsold black and white or monochrome units. [...] Color broadcasting in Europe was not standardized on the PAL format until the 1960s.|$|E
