40|$|The ultrasonic-imposed {{metal forming}} {{processes}} apply ultrasonic energy on the <b>punch</b> <b>die,</b> {{and then use}} the <b>punch</b> <b>die</b> to deform the workpiece. These processes decrease the interface friction and flow stress, {{and are able to}} achieve forming limits that traditional forming processes can’t do. In this study, the focuses were the experiment design and finite element analysis for ultrasonic-imposed double-cup-extrusion test (DCET) to investigate material property, material flow, and mechanism of interface friction under DCET which {{is considered to be a}} new protocol for friction evaluation. In the research, the experiment design was conducted together with the construct of an apparatus for ultrasonic-imposed metal forming processes. The friction factor calibration curve was first obtained through the finite element software “DEFORM ” in order to evaluate the interface friction factor of ultrasonic-imposed DCET processes. The results show that in the DCET, the ratio of the height of the upper cup to the height of the lower cup is extremely sensitive to friction. With smaller diameter of the workpiece, the sensitivity of the cup height ratio gets higher. Further, under the effect of ultrasonic vibration, the forming force will be decreased, because the ultrasonic vibration increased the temperature of the workpiece. Meanwhile, the friction factor was also increased. With the lubrication of Blue Moly, the observed friction factors of the traditional and ultrasonic-imposed metal forming processes were 0. 03 and 0. 1 respectively.

Experiment shave been conducted using different material, <b>punch</b> <b>die</b> clearances and different cutting speeds. In {{order to determine the}} reachable cutting speeds and calculate the energy required for blanking, velocity stroke cures were obtained. The quality of the part edges shows that higher cutting speeds can improve the part edge quality, resulting in smaller burr height and rollover, and a larger shear zone. Furthermore, it could be observed that the part quality improvement when blanking with high cutting speeds is much more distinct for stele than for copper or aluminum. According to blanking theory, this improvement was expected because copper and aluminum have much higher heat conduction coefficients. Therefore, the at dissipates faster and the desired stress relief effect does not take place to the same degree as for stele...|$|E

However, the inherent dynamics {{of such a}} process {{makes it difficult to}} develop a practical high speed punch press. The fracture phenomenon governing the blanking process has to be well understood to correctly design the machine support and the tooling. To observe this phenomenon at various controlled blanking speeds a specific experimental device has been developed. The goal is to measure accurately the shear blanking forces imposed on the specimen during blanking. In this paper a new method allowing the blanking forces to be measured and taking into account the proposed test configuration is explained.

40|$|Purpose: Punching process {{currently}} {{plays an}} important role in industrial mass production. The current study focuses on increasing accuracy, performance and extending service life of <b>punches</b> and <b>dies.</b> Optimizing the design of the <b>punch</b> and <b>die</b> has been a common topic for scholars. Design/methodology/approach: The input parameters (punching times, clearance) and output results (wear) were used to construct a training database. The abductive network formulation established a relationship between input parameters and output results. By using the abductive modeling technique, the complicated and uncertain relationships between the input and output variables can be formulated into a useful mathematical model. Once the abductive network model was constructed, the relationships between input and output parameters variables became available. A simulated annealing algorithm (SA) with a performance index was established to optimize this process and find the best result as compared with the actual experiment values. Findings: This study aims to establish the relationship between punching times, clearance and wear of micro punches using the abductive network, and to find relational model involving input parameters and output result of <b>punching</b> <b>die</b> in composite blanking processes. This model can be used to estimate wear between <b>punch</b> and <b>die</b> for industrial applications. Research limitations/implications: Setting up the relational expression of punching times, clearance and wear requires a well-established database covering sufficient relevant parameters and data. In training the database, it is helpful to establish a good relational model among punching parameters. Incorrect data will cause abnormal wear. As a result, the mathematics model is difficult to converge and the neural network will inaccurately predict wear. In addition, the <b>punching</b> <b>die</b> may be changed prematurely, which increases production costs. Delay in replacing a worn <b>punching</b> <b>die</b> can result in poor quality of products. Originality/value: As electronic production becomes increasingly smaller, the opportunity to use micro <b>punches</b> and <b>dies</b> will expand accordingly. This study established the relational expression of input and output, which can be used to correctly estimate any wear condition. This result is based on an abductive network and SA method...|$|R

The {{temperature}} remarkably elevates and the material softens in the thin severely deformed layer. The cut faces are contacted each other with sliding motion immediately after shearing. Sheet materials are a pure aluminum A 1050 and its alloy A 5052. Two similar sets of circular shearing <b>punch,</b> <b>die</b> and sheet are concentrically stacked in the device for performing the simultaneous shearing. The upper sheared circular sheet slides into the hole of the lower one for joining shortly after the shearing. Strain-rate order was about 104 /s in shearing, where the punches were driven by a drop-weight. Quasi-static test was also conducted for comparison. Joining was achieved only in the high-speed test. Joining boundary was not visible at the central portion in thickness, though the gap openings were seen near both sheet surfaces. Joining efficiency was evaluated as the relative strength to the tensile strength of the material. It was improved as the shearing clearance becomes smaller. The maximum efficiency was about 30 % for A 1050 material. It is about 25 % for A 5052. It was at most 10 % in the joining of A 1050 and A 5052...|$|E

Finite element results are presented with different working condition parameters, such as material thickness, punch speed, friction coefficient between <b>punch,</b> <b>die</b> and sheet metal, and blank holder force. Then, a two-layer back propagation network is developed to best fit this discrete engineering problem. Different number of neurons in the hidden layer, three commonly used training algorithms, and two performance functions are adopted and compared to choose the suitable one to minimize the error between the predictive value and the simulation results (one with ideal output). After comparison, the neuron number in the hidden layer is determined to be 12 and the appropriate learning algorithm is Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The difference between two performance algorithms is small. The mean square error between the predicted value and targeted one is less than 0. 2 %. Finally, five sheet metal forming processes under various working conditions are predicted and compared with the finite element method (FEM) result to verify the validity of this neural network model.

40|$|Electrolytic cells convert {{chemical}} energy directly into electrical energy cleanly and efficiently. An integral {{component of a}} fuel cell and an electrolytic cell is the electrolyte, a material that conducts ions. Liquid electrolytes can be aqueous as in the phosphoric acid and alkaline fuel cells, or molten, as in the molten carbonate fuel cells. A solid electrolyte is preferable because it allows sturdier, more efficient and corrosion resistant systems to be built. The main objective of this work {{is to develop a}} solid electrolyte for hydrogen production by electrolysis of hydrogen sulfide. Barium Hydrogen Phosphate, Barium Dihydrogen Phosphate, Cesium Hydrogen Carbonate, and Ammonium Iodide received brief attention but Cesium Hydrogen Sulfate was the primary candidate considered. Initial investigation has verified that Cesium Hydrogen Sulfate undergoes an impressive first-order phase transition at approximately 140 °C at which the proton conductivity increases by almost four orders of magnitude. An electrochemical cell was designed and developed by Erik Todd for the production of hydrogen. Hydrogen sulfide can electrolyzed into hydrogen and sulfur in an electrochemical cell. Sulfur is in a low viscosity molten state at a temperature of 150 °C. A cell with cesium hydrogen sulfate electrolyte canoperate at this temperature where liquid sulfur and gaseous hydrogen can move out of the cell as they are formed. Consequently, the electrolyte must possess a high conductivity at this temperature to facilitate the migration of hydrogen ions to the negative electrode through the electrolyte. Cesium Hydrogen Sulfate is known to act as an insulator at room temperature and a protonic conductor at 140 °C. Hence it comes as an obvious choice as an electrolyte in a hydrogen sulfide electrochemical cell. The structural and chemical properties of Cesium Hydrogen Sulfate were investigated.  The CsHSOâ electrolyte was prepared by the reaction of cesium carbonate and cesium sulfate with sulfuric acid respectively.  A <b>punch,</b> <b>die</b> and base were designed and fabricated to 0. 52 ̆ 2 and 2. 02 ̆ 2 diameter pellets for that purpose.  X-ray diffraction was performed on the 0. 52 ̆ 2 diameter pellets to identify and characterize the polycrystalline phases of the solid acid electrolyte.  Differential Scanning Calorimetry was performed so as to ascertain the phase transition temperature.  The temperature at which the phase transition occurs was further confirmed by impedance measurements. A test setup was built in order to perform impedance measurements. An experiment to measure the impedance of a 0. 52 ̆ 2 diameter pellet of silver iodide was performed in order to test the validity of the setup.  An infrared analysis was performed on the prepared sample CsHSOâ in order to identify the bond environment of the electrolyte.  Differential scanning calorimetry was performed with Barium Hydrogen Phosphate, Barium Dihydrogen Phosphate, Cesium Hydrogen Carbonate and Ammonium Iodide to identify their phase transition temperatures.  A successful electrolysis of steam experiment was carried out using the CsHSOâ electrolyte to evaluate its performance.  Finally, the CsHSOâ electrolyte was tested in the hydrogen sulfide electrochemical cell for the production of hydrogen and sulfur...|$|E
