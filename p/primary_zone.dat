The {{metallurgical}} {{observations of}} microstructure {{characteristics of the}} adiabatic shear bands(ASB) within the <b>primary</b> shear <b>zones</b> of the serrated chips produced during high speed machining high strength steel have been performed by using optical microscope, SEM and TEM. The observations showed that the microstructure between the matrix {{and the center of}} the ASB gradually was changed, the fine equiaxed grains appeared with size of about 0. 4 ～ 0. 6 µm {{in the center of the}} adiabatic shear band. The serrated chip formation was likely due to material softening that occurred in the <b>primary</b> shear <b>zones.</b> The microstructural development of dynamic recovery and rotational dynamic recrystallization is the dominant metallurgical process leading to material softening in <b>primary</b> shear <b>zone</b> during high speed machining.

50|$|A colony {{is founded}} by a larva which settles and metamorphoses into a zooid, the ancestrula. In Cyclostomata it may be of two types: holoancestrula and artroancenstrula (in crisiids) The ancestrula {{gives rise to a}} second {{generation}} of zooids, which in turn gives rise to a third, and so on, in a process called astogeny. Generational variation among zooids is called astogenetic differentiation. In all species, there is a <b>primary</b> <b>zone</b> of differentiation, which is limited to the first few generations and followed by a much longer zone of repetition of nearly identical zooids. In some species, however, there is a secondary differentiated zone, which can take various forms. In species in which the colony branches, new branches normally arise by division of a distal growing tip of an existing branch. An adventitious branch, in contrast, is one that arises from the side of an existing branch, beginning with a short series of differentiated zooids, a secondary zone. Subsequent generations of zooids along the branch then typically return to the normal colony budding pattern.|$|E

50|$|The treated ore is {{introduced}} to a water-filled aeration tank containing surfactant such as methylisobutyl carbinol (MIBC). Air is constantly forced through the slurry and the air bubbles attach to the hydrophobic copper sulfide particles, which are conducted to the surface, where they form a froth and are skimmed off. These skimmings are generally subjected to a cleaner-scavenger cell to remove excess silicates and to remove other sulfide minerals that can deleteriously impact the concentrate quality (typically, galena), and the final concentrate sent for smelting. The rock which has not floated off in the flotation cell is either discarded as tailings or further processed to extract other metals such as lead (from galena) and zinc (from sphalerite), should they exist. To improve the process efficiency, lime is used to raise the pH of the water bath, causing the collector to ionize more and to preferentially bond to chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) and avoid the pyrite (FeS2). Iron exists in both <b>primary</b> <b>zone</b> minerals. Copper ores containing chalcopyrite can be concentrated to produce a concentrate with between 20% and 30% copper-in-concentrate (usually 27-29% copper); {{the remainder of the}} concentrate is iron and sulfur in the chalcopyrite, and unwanted impurities such as silicate gangue minerals or other sulfide minerals, typically minor amounts of pyrite, sphalerite or galena. Chalcocite concentrates typically grade between 37% and 40% copper-in-concentrate, as chalcocite has no iron within the mineral.|$|E

Cerebral oxygen saturation was measured either ipsilaterally (three seizures) or contralaterally (four seizures) to the <b>primary</b> epileptogenic <b>zone.</b> Since NIRS measures cerebral tissue oxygenation in a depth of only few centimetres, it did not record within the <b>primary</b> epileptogenic <b>zone</b> in our patients.
