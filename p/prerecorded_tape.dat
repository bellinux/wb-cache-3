50|$|Whereas loops {{are usually}} a phrase {{played on a}} musical instrument, this type of sample is usually a single note. Music {{workstations}} and samplers use samples of musical instruments {{as the basis of}} their own sounds, and are capable of playing a sample back at any pitch. Many modern synthesizers and drum machines also use samples as the basis of their sounds. (See sample-based synthesis for more information.) Most such samples are created in professional recording studios using world-class instruments played by accomplished musicians. These are usually developed by the manufacturer of the instrument or by a subcontractor who specializes in creating such samples. There are businesses and individuals who create libraries of samples of musical instruments. Of course, a sampler allows anyone to create such samples. Possibly the earliest equipment used to sample recorded instrument sounds are the Chamberlin, which was developed in the 1940s, and its better-known cousin, the Mellotron, marketed in England in the 1960s. Both are tape replay keyboards, in which each key pressed triggers a <b>prerecorded</b> <b>tape</b> recording of a single note.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1980s, {{scholars}} and musicians began to take {{a fresh look at}} Giraud's original texts, thereby initiating an implicit interrogation of the superiority of the Hartleben translations. Two works are especially illustrative of this development. The first, the volume Pierrot Lunaire, of 1982, is a retranslation of the Hartleben versions back into French by the poets Michel Butor and Michel Launay, who conclude their work with poems of their own inspired by Giraud. The second, Variations: Beyond Pierrot (1995), is a work by the American composer Larry Austin. Each of its three ten-minute sections features a Sprechstimme soprano who sings fragments of Schoenberg's 21 selections accompanied by flute, clarinet, violin, cello, and piano. She sometimes renders those fragments in Giraud's original French, sometimes in Hartleben's German, at other times in English and Japanese. Drawing upon live computer-processed sound and computer-processed <b>prerecorded</b> <b>tape,</b> the composition attempts (in Austin's words) to go [...] "beyond Schoenberg's musical melodrama" [...] to create a [...] "multi-lingual dream of the essences of the poems".|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} noise {{reduction}} and other schemes {{are used to}} increase fidelity, with Dolby B being almost universal for both <b>prerecorded</b> <b>tapes</b> and home recording. Dolby B was designed to address the high-frequency noise inherent in cassette tapes, and along with improvements in tape formulation it helped the cassette win acceptances as a high-fidelity medium. At the same time, Dolby B provided acceptable performance when played back on decks that lacked Dolby circuitry, meaning there was little reason not to use it if it was available.|$|R
50|$|On <b>prerecorded</b> <b>tapes,</b> the {{information}} about album artist, album title, and track titles and lengths is recorded in the auxiliary ninth track continuously {{for the length of}} the entire tape. This makes it possible for players to recognize immediately what the tape position is and how to get to any of the other tracks (including which side of the tape to turn to), as soon as a tape is inserted and playback is started, regardless of whether the tape was rewound before inserting or not.|$|R
50|$|The compact {{cassette}} {{became a}} major consumer audio format and advances in electronic and mechanical miniaturization {{led to the development}} of the Sony Walkman, a pocket-sized cassette player introduced in 1979. The Walkman was the first personal music player and it gave a major boost to sales of prerecorded cassettes, which became the first widely successful release format that used a re-recordable medium: the vinyl record was a playback-only medium and commercially <b>prerecorded</b> <b>tapes</b> for reel-to-reel tape decks, which many consumers found difficult to operate, were never more than an uncommon niche market item.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cases that}} DCCs come in {{generally}} {{do not have the}} characteristic folding mechanism of those for analog compact cassettes. Instead, DCC cases tend to be simply plastic boxes that are open on one of the short sides. The front side has a hole that is almost the size of the cassette, so that any label on the cassette is exposed even when the cassette is in its case. This allows the user to slide the cassette {{into and out of the}} case with one hand, and it reduced production costs, especially for prerecorded cassettes, because a label is needed only for the cassette rather than for the case. Format partner Matsushita does, however, produce blank cassettes (under their Panasonic brand) with a clam-shell-style case. Because DCCs have no [...] "bulges" [...] near the tape access holes, there is more space in the case behind the cassette to insert, for example, a booklet for a <b>prerecorded</b> <b>tape,</b> or a folded up card on which users could write the contents of the tape. In spite of the differences, the outside measurements of the standard DCC cases are exactly identical to the cases of analog compact cassettes, so they can be used in existing storage systems. The Matsushita-designed clam-shell case is slightly thinner than an analog compact cassette case is.|$|E
40|$|The term 'standard' {{can refer}} to any social {{convention}} (standard of conduct, legal standards), but it most often refers to conventions that require exact uniformity (standards of measurement, computer operating systems). Current efforts to control the development of high-resolution television, multitasking computer-operating systems, and videotaping formats have heightened interest in standards. The economic literature on standards has focused recently {{on the possibility of}} market failure with respect to the choice of a standard. In its strongest form, the argument is essentially this: an established standard can persist over a challenger, even where all users prefer a world dominated by the challenger, if users are unable to coordinate their choices. For example, each of us might prefer to have Beta-format videocassette recorders as long as prerecorded Beta tapes continue to be produced, but individually we do not buy Beta machines because we don't think enough others will buy Beta machines to sustain the <b>prerecorded</b> <b>tape</b> supply. I don't buy a Beta format machine because I think that you won't you don't buy one because you think that I won't. In the end, we both turn out to be correct, but we are both worse off than we might have been. This, of course, is a catch- 22 that we might suppose to be common in the economy. There will be no cars until there are gas stations there will be no gas stations until there are cars.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of auditory background interference on test performance on a group of schizophrenics as well as with a normal group and to ascertain if subgroups of each type could be differentiated on neuopsychological measures from the WMS-R particularly sensitive to left-hemispheric functions. There were 60 subjects, 30 normals and 30 schizophrenics, who volunteered to participate in the study. The schizophrenics, all hospitalized at Logansport State Hospital, had a diagnosis of chronic undifferentiated schizophrenia. The normals were students at Logansport High School enrolled in a senior psychology class. The research utilized a counterbalanced design in which subjects were administered items from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised in both a normal administration condition and in the presence of auditory background information provided by a <b>prerecorded</b> <b>tape.</b> The relationship between auditory background interference and diagnosis was examined using an analysis of variance (MANOVA) of the difference between means. The overall mean for groups did not differ significantly, F (1, 58) =. 087. No test was identified as being able to differentiate left-hemispheric functions for either group in either testing condition, F (4, 55) = 1. 09, p. 37. There also was no statistically significant difference between the test performance of males and females in the presence of auditory background interference. The results indicate that neither group evidenced much change in perfromance in the presence of auditory background information. This would suggest that the testing conditionn had little influence on test results. It also suggests that internal differences, as opposed to the external environment, contributed much more to the differences in test performance. The lack of significant differences on the subtests that are considered measures of left-hemispheric functioning may have been due to the significant cognitive impairments of the schizophrenics. The normals may have been more able to increase their attentional and concentration skills in the presence of auditory background interference so that no decreases in performance resulted.

5000|$|Entrepreneur Earl [...] "Madman" [...] Muntz of Los Angeles, California saw a {{potential}} in these broadcast carts {{for an automobile}} music tape system, and in 1962 introduced his [...] "Stereo-Pak 4-Track Stereo Tape Cartridge System" [...] and <b>prerecorded</b> <b>tapes,</b> initially in California and Florida. He licensed popular music albums from the major record companies and duplicated them on these 4-track cartridges, or CARtridges, as they were first advertised. Previously, music in the car had been restricted mostly to radios. Records, due to their methods of operation and size, were not practical {{for use in a}} car, although several companies tried to market an automobile record player including the Highway Hi-Fi.|$|R
50|$|Reel-to-reel {{magnetic}} tape recorders posed a new challenge to the LP in the 1950s, but the higher cost of <b>prerecorded</b> <b>tapes</b> {{was one of several}} factors that confined tape to a niche market. Cartridge and cassette tapes were more convenient and less expensive than reel-to-reel tapes, and they became popular for use in automobiles beginning in the mid-1960s. However, the LP was not seriously challenged as the primary medium for listening to recorded music at home until the 1970s, when the audio quality of the cassette was greatly improved by better tape formulations and noise-reduction systems. By 1983, cassettes were outselling LPs in the US.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{format for}} magnetic tape sound reproduction was the reel-to-reel tape recorder, first {{available in the}} US in the late 1940s, but too expensive and bulky to be practical for amateur home use {{until well into the}} 1950s. Loading a reel of tape onto the machine and threading it through the various guides and rollers proved daunting to some casual users—certainly, it was more difficult than putting a vinyl record on a record player and flicking a switch. Because in early years each tape had to be dubbed from the master tape in real-time to maintain good sound quality, <b>prerecorded</b> <b>tapes</b> were more expensive to manufacture, and costlier to buy, than vinyl records which could be stamped much quicker than their own playing time.|$|R

50|$|The {{heyday of}} <b>prerecorded</b> reel <b>tapes</b> was the mid-1960s, {{but after the}} {{introduction}} of less complicated cassette tapes and 8-track tapes, the number of albums released on <b>prerecorded</b> reel <b>tape</b> dropped dramatically despite their superior sound quality. By the latter 1960s, their retail prices were considerably higher than competing formats, and musical genres were limited—classical, soundtracks, original cast albums, major pop stars—to those most likely to appeal to well-heeled audiophiles willing {{to contend with the}} cumbersome threading of open-reel tape. The introduction of the Dolby noise-reduction system narrowed the performance gap between cassettes and open-reel, and by 1973 the prerecorded open-reel offerings had almost completely disappeared, even from record stores and audio equipment shops. Columbia House advertisements in 1978 showed that only 1/3 of new titles were available on reel-to-reel; they continued to offer a select number of new releases in the format until 1984.|$|R

5000|$|The next {{important}} innovation {{was small}} cartridge-based tape systems, {{of which the}} compact cassette, commercialized by the Philips electronics company in 1964, is the best known. Initially, a low-fidelity format for spoken-word voice recording and inadequate for music reproduction, {{after a series of}} improvements it entirely replaced the competing formats, the larger 8-track tape (used primarily in cars) and the fairly similar [...] "Deutsche Cassette" [...] developed by the German company Grundig. This latter system was not particularly common in Europe and practically unheard-of in America. The compact cassette became a major consumer audio format and advances in electronic and mechanical miniaturization {{led to the development of}} the Sony Walkman, a pocket-sized cassette player introduced in 1979.

50|$|Despite its {{convenience}} the RCA {{tape cartridge}} {{was not much}} of a success. RCA was slow to produce machines for the home market. They were also slow to license <b>prerecorded</b> music <b>tapes</b> for home playback. Cost was also an issue, with a single cartridge costing US$4.50 in 1960 ($ with inflation today) compared to a 1,200 foot reel of tape, which cost $3.50 ($ today). The format disappeared from retail stores by 1964.|$|R
2500|$|Rather than {{destroying}} film studios, videotape sales {{became increasingly}} {{important to their}} revenue. The press discussed the VCR [...] "and the viewing habits it has engendered — the Saturday night trip down to the tape rental store to pick out {{for a couple of}} bucks the movie you want to see when you want to see it". Film studios opened new divisions to produce <b>prerecorded</b> <b>tapes,</b> and by 1985 their sales were about the same as box office revenue; the Associated Press reported that [...] "because of the VCR, even a bad movie can make money". Although the VCR received blame for a 25% decline in the summer 1985 box office compared to 1984's, and closing movie theaters, by 1987 it was credited with causing a record-high box office, as videotapes' popularity encouraged consumers' interest in films and watching them in theaters. Cable movie channels worried about VCRs affecting subscriptions, but began to offer more films for owners who wanted to build a home library, even encouraging time shifting by broadcasting the movies during the night so VCRs could record them while their owners slept.|$|R

5000|$|The first <b>prerecorded</b> reel-to-reel <b>tapes</b> were {{introduced}} in the USA in 1949; the catalog contained fewer than ten titles with no popular artists.

RCA Victor joined the reel-to-reel business in 1954. In 1955, EMI released 2-track [...] "stereosonic" [...] tapes, although the catalog took longer to be published. Since these EMI tapes were much more expensive than a vinyl LP record, sales were poor; still, EMI released over 300 [...] "stereosonic" [...] titles.
