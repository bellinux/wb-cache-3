40|$|The enzymatic transformations during {{storage of}} <b>pomaces</b> greatly affect the {{composition}} of Italian Grappa. This study examines the impact of pectin methylesterase (PME), β- glucosidase (βG) and esterases (ESTs) on {{the composition of}} Moscato and Prosecco Grappa. Grape <b>pomaces</b> were fermented for differing periods of time. After protein extraction, the enzymatic activities were detected by spectrophotometric and electrophoretic methods. To determine by gas chromatography the evolution of methanol, terpenes, ethyl acetate and lactate in <b>pomaces</b> and Grappa samples, distillations by Cazenave equipment and a traditional copper alambic were performed. Sensorial evaluation was carried out. There is a close relationship between the PME activity of grape <b>pomaces,</b> the degree of pectin methylation, and the concentration of methanol before distillation. The results obtained suggest that inhibition of grape <b>pomaces</b> PME may be adopted to control methanol concentration. The glycosidases of grape and/or yeast {{seem to have a}} limited effect on the release of volatile compounds from glycosides located in grape skins. As regards the contribution of grape and microorganism esterase, several hypotheses are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{composition}} of four selected fruit <b>pomaces</b> (agro-industrial wastes) was evaluated. The effect of temperature, time, acid concentration and solid:liquid (S:L) ratio on dilute-acid hydrolysis of selected <b>pomaces</b> were investigated using 24 factorial and central composite design and optimum hydrolysis conditions were determined. A preliminary study was initiated using apple hydrolysate and the fungus Tricoderma harzianum {{in order to}} explore and demonstrate their potential uses in bioethanol production. Chemical {{composition of}} <b>pomaces</b> was promising as fermentation media. The highest reducing sugar yield from the optimization step was 31 %, 49 %, 56 % and 52 % for apple, apricot, orange and peach <b>pomaces,</b> respectively under optimum hydrolysis conditions. Neither furfural nor hydroxmethylfurfural (HMF) were detected in hydrolysates. The highest bioethanol production (1. 67 g/L) was obtained in 6 days in a non-static incubator using Tricoderma harzianum pregrown in minimal medium. It was demonstrated that selected <b>pomaces</b> holds potential for bioethanol production and can be eliminated without being potential waste problem to the environment, with economical return. Although, this work is an initial study in showing the potential of these <b>pomaces</b> and T. harzianum in bioethanol production, an extensive study on the optimization of fermentation parameters is recommended for further increase of bioethanol production.

40|$|SUMMARY. Existing laws in Italy propose olive mill <b>pomaces</b> (OMP), {{produced}} by the two phase system, as a soil amendant. The direct supply of such a raw material poses sorne problems due to the rainy season and its phytotoxicity. The bioremediation of olive mill <b>pomaces</b> can be an useful and economic technology to overcome those backdowns. Composting has been performed in a forced aerated static pile, mixing OMP with chopped wheat straw. During the process moisture content, pH, EC, organic carbon, nitro gen and phytotoxicity were determined. The thermophilic phase lasted 60 days. The phytotoxicity disappeared {{at the end of}} the thermophilic phase. The final product has been examined to determine its physical, chemical and biological characteristics. At the end of the process a C/N = 31 was determined. This high value depends on the presence ofthe grinded stones, hardly to be microbiologically degraded.

25|$|During this period, rakı was {{produced}} by distillation of grapes <b>pomace</b> (cibre) obtained during wine fermentation. When the amount of <b>pomace</b> was not sufficient, alcohol imported from Europe would be added.

25|$|As {{with many}} Bordeaux estates, the basket press {{has come back}} into vogue but with modern {{elements}} such as pneumatic controls.

40|$|Grape extract rich in {{polyphenols}} (∼ 129 ± 32 mg of {{gallic acid}} equivalents per g of dry extract) {{was obtained from}} the <b>pomaces</b> of Cannonau grapes by homogenization in an ethanol/water mixture. The efficacy of ultrasounds in speeding up the extraction kinetics of polyphenols was demonstrated. The extract was incorporated in liposomes and PEVs (penetration enhancer containing vesicles) with Labrasol® or Labrasol®/ethanol. All the vesicles were spherical and predominantly unilamellar: liposomes were large (∼ 927 nm) and polydispersed (PI ∼ 0. 56), while PEVs were small (∼ 140 nm) and fairly homogeneous (PI ∼ 0. 3). Moreover, PEVs were able to incorporate a high amount of the extract (∼ 98 % of the extract used for their preparation, 50 mg/ml). The formulations were highly cytocompatible and were able to promote the proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts. In addition, thanks to their antioxidant activity, grape extract formulations provided a cytoprotective effect against oxidative stress damage. Therefore, an efficient, environmentally-friendly extraction strategy is proposed to obtain an extract with high phenolic content from waste grape <b>pomaces,</b> which was incorporated in vesicular systems to maximize the antioxidant power in a cell model of oxidative stres...|$|R

25|$|In Europe {{during the}} Middle Ages, beer, often of very low strength, was an {{everyday}} drink for all classes and ages of people. A document {{from that time}} mentions nuns having an allowance of six pints of ale each day. Cider and <b>pomace</b> wine were also widely available; grape wine was the prerogative of the higher classes.|$|E
25|$|Cretan wine came to {{prominence}} later. A secondary wine made from water and <b>pomace</b> (the residue from squeezed grapes), mixed with lees, {{was made by}} country people for their own use. The Greeks sometimes sweetened their wine with honey and made medicinal wines by adding thyme, pennyroyal and other herbs. By the first century, if not before, they were familiar with wine flavoured with pine resin (modern retsina). Aelian also mentions a wine mixed with perfume. Cooked wine was known, {{as well as a}} sweet wine from Thásos, similar to port wine.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans {{developed}} {{large wooden}} wine presses that utilized large beams, capstans and windlasses to exert {{pressure on the}} <b>pomace.</b> That style of wine press would eventually evolve into the basket press used in the Middle Ages by wine estates of the nobility and Catholic Church. There are many church records that showed feudal land tenants {{were willing to pay}} a portion of their crop to use a landlord's wine press if it was available. This was likely because added volume of wine (anywhere from 15-20%) that pressing could produce versus manual treading was substantial enough to justify the cost.|$|E
40|$|Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most harmful soilborne pathogens, which reduces productivity of horticultural crops. Currently used chemical or biological methods for the eradication of S. sclerotiorum from a soil are not very effective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of eradication of S. sclerotiorum sclerotia from a soil using the Trichoderma isolates, which were multiplied on the organic carriers prepared from agro-industrial wastes and by-products: WsA (wheat straw + apple <b>pomaces),</b> WsP (wheat straw + potato pulp) and T-GRAN (dry onion rind, apples and strawberry <b>pomaces,</b> rapeseed meal). The results showed that soil amendment with organic materials overgrown with the Trichoderma fungi had a significant reducing effect on S. sclerotiorum. Especially effective was the carrier WsA overgrown with T. virens TRS 114, which completely prevented the survival of sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum regardless of the dose of application. Less effective was the WsP carrier. However, addition WsP overgrown with T. atroviride TRS 40 at the 5 % w/v, resulted in survival only 6. 7 % of sclerotia. In the greenhouse experiments with lettuce, the application of granulates T-GRAN into the soil had different impact on S. sclerotiorum depending on the conditions to the pathogen development. In conducive conditions, an addition of the organic substances without Trichoderma significantly decreased the yield of lettuce plants. A positive effect on the growth of plants was observed after the application of T-GRAN overgrown with Trichoderma...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, many efforts {{were focused on}} the {{thermochemical}} transformation of agricultural and industrial residues to generate energy, chemicals or activated carbons. The present study concerns olive <b>pomaces</b> (O. P) materials coming from the Region of Meknès – Tafilalet. These residues result from the olive oil extraction process (pulp and stones). The studied samples are raw and pressed O-P, dried at various temperatures (40 °C- 60 °C- 80 °C) in using thermal solar energy. The physico-chemical characteristics of these samples and of hemicellulose (H.), cellulose (C.) and lignin (L.) compounds are compared, before and after their carbonization. The thermal treatments of such materials lead to chars {{which can be used}} as precursors for the synthesis of activated carbons...|$|R
25|$|In the vineyard, {{nitrogen}} {{is taken}} up by the grapevine as nitrate (NO3−), ammonium or urea which gets reduced into ammonia. Through additional reactions the nitrogen is incorporated into glutamine and glutamate and eventually used in the synthesis of other amino acids and nitrogenous compounds. After harvest, the majority (around 80%) of available nitrogenous compounds found in the grapes are concentrated in the skins and seeds. These compounds get released into the must during the process of crushing and during maceration/skin contact. Even after pressing up to 80% of initial nitrogen content within each grape berry will be left behind in the <b>pomace.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} {{nutrients}} {{are available in}} the must and skins of the grapes themselves but sometimes are supplemented by winemakers with additions such as diammonium phosphate (DAP), freeze-dried micro-nutrients (such as Go-Ferm and Ferm-K) and even the remnant of dead or extracted yeast cells such that the fermenting yeast can break down to mine for available nitrogen and nutrients. One historical winemaking tradition that is still practiced in some Italian wine regions is the ripasso method of adding the leftover <b>pomace</b> from the pressing of other wines into a newly fermenting batch of wine as an additional food source for the yeast.|$|E
25|$|Galicia has 30 {{products}} with Denominación de orixe (D.O.), {{some of them}} with Denominación de Orixe Protexida (D.O.P.).

Galicia produces a number of high-quality Galician wines, including Albariño, Ribeiro, Ribeira Sacra, Monterrei and Valdeorras. The grape varieties used are local and rarely found outside Galicia and Northern Portugal. Just as notably from Galicia comes the spirit Augardente—the name means burning water—often referred to as Orujo in Spain and internationally or as caña in Galicia. This spirit is made from the distillation of the <b>pomace</b> of grapes.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the active}} {{components}} of grape <b>pomaces</b> were first extracted by maceration in ethanol and propylene glycol, then in {{extra virgin olive}} oil. The main components of the hydrophilic extractive solutions were flavonoids, while monounsaturated fatty acids were the most abundant constituents of the extractive oil, {{with high levels of}} oleic acid, which were identified by HPLC/DAD and GC/MS, respectively. The hydrophilic extractive solutions and the lipophilic extractive oil were used to prepare phospholipid vesicles, avoiding the energetically and economically expensive steps required to obtain solid matrixes or pure compounds. The obtained grape bioactive enriched penetration enhancer containing vesicles (PEVs) were multilamellar, around 200  nm in size, and more viscous than the corresponding solutions. The antioxidant activity, evaluated by the Folin-Ciocalteu and DPPH assays, was potentiated when the extractive solutions were loaded in PEVs. Further, the grape enriched PEVs were able to ensure an optimal protection against oxidative stress in an ex vivo human erythrocytes-based model...|$|R
40|$|An {{approach}} for the integrated utilization of grape skins from white grape <b>pomaces</b> has been proposed. This consists of consecutive or simultaneous extraction of grape skins with neutral organic solvent and water under reflux. Organic extract {{is a valuable}} raw material for the isolation of oleanolic acid. The aqueous extract (ca 50 %, w/w) is composed of essentially hexoses and suitable for the high yield (till 51 %) bioethanol production at a maximum specific cell growth rate (mu(max)) of 0. 29 h(- 1). The remained extracted grape skins are the complex of structural polysaccharides embedded into cutinous matrix. Extracted grape skins were {{shown to be a}} prospective raw material for the production of low-density boards (d <= 0. 40) for insulation needs. The boards produced from grape skins and bind of 8 % urea-formaldehyde resin revealed reasonable tensile strength (0. 4 MPa) and a low thermal conductivity (0. 09 - 0. 12 W (m K) (- 1)) over a wide range of temperatures (40 - 200 degrees C).

40|$|The {{extraction}} of anthocyanin-based pigments from fruit berries and grapes is normally accomplished using ethanol or aqueous-based ethanol solutions, and occasionally ethyl acetate, acetone, or methylene chloride. Although ethanol {{is classified as}} a GRAS (Generally-Recognized-As-Safe) solvent, its utilization must be strictly accounted for under legal statues. Subcritical water under modest compression above the boiling point of normal water is an alternative medium to ethanol due to its temperature-dependent dielectric constant and cohesional energy density. In this study, subcritical water under pressure, and held at temperatures between 110 - 160 °C was utilized for the {{extraction of}} anthocyanin-based pigments from fruit berries (both wet and dry), such as elderberry, raspberry, bilberry, chokeberry; and their associated stems, skins, and <b>pomaces.</b> Extraction and screening experiments were executed using a home-built, flow through extraction system in which water and acidified water solutions were fed at a high velocity {{with the aid of}} liquid booster pump in an attached Spe-ed unit module. Additional screening experiments were conducted utilizing a Dionex Model 300 ASE (Accelerated Solven...|$|R
25|$|Screw press- Grapes {{are loaded}} into an input where a large helical screw {{transfers}} the grape across perforated cylinder {{that allows the}} release juice to escape. As screw moves further down, the cake <b>pomace</b> is subjected to increasing pressure. While the advantage is the high throughput, the harsh pressing and lots of movement causes substantial tearing and grinding of the grape skins and seeds. This causes more minerals (such as potassium, which can affect pH), tannins and natural gums to be extracted into the juice. As much as 4% v/v of the pressed juice from a screw press could be suspended solids that {{may need to be}} treated by clarification and fining agents to be stable and filterable.|$|E
25|$|The {{more modern}} {{idea of a}} piece of a {{winemaking}} equipment used to extract the juice from the skins probably emerged during the Greco-Roman periods where written accounts by Cato the Elder, Marcus Terentius Varro, Pliny the Elder and others described wooden wine presses that utilized large beams, capstans and windlasses to exert pressure on the <b>pomace.</b> The wines produced by these presses were usually darker, with more color extracted from the skins but could also be more harsh with bitter tannins also extracted. That style of wine press would eventually evolve into the basket press used in the Middle Ages by wine estates of the nobility and Catholic Church leading to the modern tank batch and continuous presses used in wineries today.|$|E
25|$|Italian Stravecchio {{has been}} {{produced}} since the 1700s in the North of Italy, especially in Emilia-Romagna and Veneto, using grapes popular in winemaking such as Sangiovese and Grignolino.

Northern Italy is also noted since the Middle Ages for another type of wine spirit, Grappa, which is generally colourless but has some top-shelf varieties called barrique which are aged in oak casks and achieve the same caramel colour as regular brandies. There is a vast production of Stravecchios and Grappas in Italy, with more than 600 large, medium or small distilleries in operation.

40|$|Virgin olive oil, {{the main}} fat of the Mediterranean diet, is per se {{considered}} as a functional food—as stated by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) —due to its content in healthy compounds. The daily intake of endogenous bioactive phenolics from virgin olive oil is variable due {{to the influence of}} multiple agronomic and technological factors. Thus, a good strategy to ensure an optimal intake of polyphenols through habitual diet would be to produce enriched virgin olive oil with well-known bioactive polyphenols. Different sources of natural biological active substances can be potentially used to enrich virgin olive oil (e. g., raw materials derived from the same olive tree, mainly olive leaves and <b>pomaces,</b> and/or other compounds from plants and vegetables, mainly herbs and spices). The development of these functional olive oils may help in prevention of chronic diseases (such as cardiovascular diseases, immune frailty, ageing disorders and degenerative diseases) and improving {{the quality of life for}} many consumers reducing health care costs. In the present review, the most relevant scientific information related to the development of enriched virgin olive oil and their positive human health effects has been collected and discussed...|$|R
50|$|Industrial use of K. marxianus is chiefly in the {{conversion}} of lactose to ethanol as a precursor {{for the production of}} biofuel. The ability for K. marxianus to reduce lactose is useful because of the potential to transform industrial whey waste, a problematic waste product for disposal, into useful biomass for animal feed, food additives or fuel. Certain strains of the fungus {{can also be used to}} convert whey to ethyl acetate, an alternative fuel source. K. marxianus is also used to produce the industrial enzymes: inulinase, β-galactosidase, and pectinase. Due to the heat tolerance of K. marxianus, high heat fermentations are feasible, reducing the costs normally expended for cooling as well as the potential for contamination by other fungi or bacteria. In addition, fermentations at higher temperatures occur more rapidly, making production much more efficient. Due to the ability of K. marxianus to simultaneously ustilize lactose and glucose, the prevalence of K. marxianus in industrial settings is high as it decreases production time and increases productivity. Recent efforts have attempted to use K. marxianus in the production of food flavourings from waste products tomato and pepper <b>pomaces</b> as substrata.|$|R
40|$|Investigation into clean {{energies}} {{has been}} focused on finding an alternative to fossil fuels in order to reduce global warming {{while at the same time}} satisfying the world’s energy needs. Biomass gasification is seen as a promising thermochemical conversion technology as it allows useful gaseous products to be obtained from low-energy-density solid fuels. Air–steam mixtures are the most commonly used gasification agents. The gasification performances of several biomass samples and their mixtures were compared. One softwood (pine) and one hardwood (chestnut), their torrefied counterparts, and other Spanish-based biomass wastes such as almond shell, olive stone, grape and olive <b>pomaces</b> or cocoa shell were tested, and their behaviors at several different stoichiometric ratios (SR) and steam/air ratios (S/A) were compared. The optimum SR was found to be in the 0. 2 – 0. 3 range for S/A = 75 / 25. At these conditions a syngas stream with 35 % of H 2 + CO and a gas yield of 2 L gas/g fuel were obtained, which represents a cold-gas efficiency of almost 50 %. The torrefaction process does not significantly affect the quality of the product syngas.
