5|$|In 1915 the 8th Battalion {{joined the}} British Army in France {{as part of}} the 3rd Canadian Division. At the Second Battle of Ypres his troops faced the brunt of the German assault, {{involving}} the first use of <b>poison</b> <b>gas</b> in modern warfare. Lipsett is credited with issuing the first order to counteract the effects of <b>poison</b> <b>gas,</b> when he ordered his men to urinate on strips of cloth and tie them to their faces to neutralise the chlorine. Lipsett's battalion was instrumental in holding the line during the action and he was consequently rewarded by being made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, promoted to acting brigadier-general and given command of the Canadian 2nd Brigade, which he trained during the spring of 1916 to conduct major trench raids on German lines.|$|E
5|$|Potassium bromide {{and sodium}} bromide {{were used as}} {{anticonvulsants}} and sedatives in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but were gradually superseded by chloral hydrate {{and then by the}} barbiturates. In {{the early years of the}} First World War, bromine compounds such as xylyl bromide were used as <b>poison</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|E
5|$|A later {{attempt by}} the Canadian Corps to extend its {{position}} into the city of Lens failed but the German and Canadian assessments of the battle concluded that it succeeded in its attrition objective. The battle was costly for both sides and many casualties were suffered from extensive use of <b>poison</b> <b>gas,</b> including the new German Yellow Cross shell containing the blistering agent sulfur mustard (mustard gas).|$|E
5000|$|The {{decision}} to award the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Fritz Haber in 1918 was, and still remains, controversial because of Haber's {{involvement in the}} development of <b>poison</b> <b>gases</b> for warfare during World War I.|$|R

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to further deceive the Germans, minor {{operations}} were conducted {{in an effort to}} suggest a forthcoming attack by the British First Army south of La Bassée Canal. This included an attack by the 9th Canadian Brigade against units of the German 36th Reserve Division at Mericourt Trench and a British First Army <b>poison</b> <b>gas</b> attack north of Loos, both in late July 1917.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, a few units arranged ceasefires but the truces {{were not}} nearly as widespread as in 1914; this was, in part, due to strongly worded orders from the high commands of both sides prohibiting fraternisation. Soldiers were no longer amenable to truce by 1916. The war had become increasingly bitter after devastating human losses suffered during the battles of the Somme and Verdun, and the incorporation of <b>poison</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{incendiary}} liquids of {{the ancient}} and medieval periods were also developed, and have their modern equivalents. World War I saw {{the development of the}} flamethrower, a modern version of the Byzantine siphons, which used gas under pressure to squirt a mixture of inflammable oil and petrol, ignited by a burning taper. Similarly, the carcass projectile found new use in the Livens Projector, a primitive mortar that could throw a large canister of inflammable liquid (it was soon used for <b>poison</b> <b>gas</b> instead).|$|E
25|$|He {{had been}} a chronic heart patient and died in Lebanon in 1963 due to a cardiac arrest. His death was officially due to {{complications}} from heart problems, though some have alleged he was <b>poisoned,</b> <b>gassed</b> or subjected to blunt-trauma in his bedroom, although is no proof of this.|$|R
50|$|The use of <b>poison</b> <b>gases,</b> {{including}} mustard agent, during warfare {{is known}} as chemical warfare, {{and this kind of}} warfare was prohibited by the Geneva Protocol of 1925, and also by the later Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. The latter agreement also prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and sale of such weapons.|$|R

5|$|When the First World War {{began in}} 1914, both of Gardiner's {{brothers}} enlisted and were sent overseas. Gardiner's father John also enlisted, but he died May 30, 1916 {{before he was}} sent overseas. Both his brothers returned home after the war ended; while Alex was unharmed, John {{had been involved in}} a <b>poison</b> <b>gas</b> attack, and was seriously ill. To help provide for the family Gardiner began working for the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Company at the age of twelve. In December 1928 John began to develop an illness {{as a result of his}} <b>poison</b> <b>gas</b> attack in the war, and died December 13. Edith had planned to get married on December 31, but wanted to delay the marriage because of John's death, though her family convinced her to continue with the original plan. Gardiner married Myrtle Brooks August 6, 1927 at Grace United Church in Winnipeg. Their first son, Robert Roy, was born May 20, 1929. They also had a girl on May 7, 1931, but she died the same day.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine, {{a common}} {{industrial}} chemical, {{is outside the}} scope of the disarmament agreement; however, its use as a <b>poison</b> <b>gas</b> would violate the Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria joined in 2013. Various parties, including Western governments, have accused Assad of conducting illegal chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. A late disclosure in 2014 regarding Syria's ricin program raised doubts about completeness of the government's declaration of its chemical weapons stockpile, and in early May 2015, OPCW announced that inspectors had found traces of sarin and VX nerve agent at a military research site in Syria that had not been declared previously by the Assad regime.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Charlotte Staples Lewis is {{a fictional}} {{character}} on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) television series Lost, played by Rebecca Mader. Charlotte is {{introduced in the}} second episode of season four and is a cultural anthropologist {{on a mission to}} the island where Oceanic Flight 815 crashed. On the island she is initially held hostage by one of the plane crash survivors, John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), but is freed when another person from her team switches place with her. She helps prevent <b>poison</b> <b>gas</b> from being released over the island, and develops a relationship with Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies). Charlotte dies in Daniel's arms after the frequent time traveling causes her headaches to worsen into something unexplainable.|$|E
50|$|The Germans {{waited until}} 6 August {{for the right}} wind conditions. At 4 am, at the same times as regular {{artillery}} started their bombardment, German forces used <b>poison</b> <b>gases</b> against the defenders.Thinking {{that all of the}} defenders were dead, fourteen battalions of Landwehr - at least 7000 infantry men - began advancing. When German infantry reached the first line of defense, they encountered what was left of 13th company of the 226th Zemlyansk regiment (about 100 men). Being unprepared for resistance and seeing the bloody clothing the remaining defenders wore (Russian soldiers were coughing blood up because {{of the effects of the}} <b>poison</b> <b>gases)</b> put the Germans in a state of shock and caused them to break and run. The five remaining Russian guns subsequently opened fire on the retreating Germans. European papers afterwards called this «».|$|R

50|$|During World War I, Fritz Haber {{became a}} staunch {{supporter}} of the German military effort and {{played an important role}} in the development of chemical weapons (particularly <b>poison</b> <b>gases).</b> His efforts would culminate in his supervision of the first successful deployment of a weapon of mass destruction in military history, in Flanders, Belgium on 22 April 1915.|$|R
5|$|Government {{officials}} {{stood on}} trucks, using loudspeakers {{to call out}} above the noise, urging the Buddhists — primarily high school and university students who had arrived on bicycles — to disperse. The announcements were met by jeers when the government spokesperson blamed the unrest on the Vietcong. At 18:30, the military personnel at the scene dispersed the crowd by emptying vials of brownish-red liquid on the heads of praying protestors, resulting in 67 Buddhists being hospitalized for chemical injuries. The symptoms consisted of severe blistering of the skin and respiratory ailments. The crowd responded angrily to the apparent use of <b>poison</b> <b>gas,</b> and the incident became a public relations disaster for Diệm.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF used Vengeance {{aircraft}} for {{a variety}} of tasks following their withdrawal from combat roles. The type was operated by Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 Communication Units, which were responsible for light transport and training tasks. No. 1 Air Performance Unit employed Vengeances as target tugs and for trials purposes. No. 7 Operational Training Unit, which was responsible for converting aircrew to Liberator bombers, was issued with Vengeance target tugs. Vengeances were also used in trials of <b>poison</b> <b>gas</b> conducted by the 1st Australian Field Experimental Station, Royal Australian Engineers, near Proserpine, Queensland, during 1944. In May 1944, Vengeances from No. 21 Squadron were used to impersonate German Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers during the production of the movie The Rats of Tobruk. For this task the aircraft were painted with Luftwaffe markings.|$|E
5|$|The game world's {{design and}} the game's {{attention}} to detail were well received by critics. Game Informers Andrew Reiner said the game's setting had a taut and mesmerizing atmosphere, and {{was a place of}} wonder and inexplicable horror. Miller called it the right mix of creepy and cool, and appreciated the gradual damage reflected on Batman's suit as the story progressed, but said that pixelated CGI and lip synching issues diminished the presentation. Whitehead said that the impressive animation makes Batman feel alive, but wrote that the world itself was lifeless and lacking in interactive objects. He criticized segments in which character logic was sacrificed for video game tropes, citing repeated use of <b>poison</b> <b>gas</b> and electric floors as obstacles.|$|E
50|$|In 1915 {{his friend}} Fritz Haber {{asked him to}} join in the {{development}} of <b>poison</b> <b>gasses.</b> Willstätter would not work on poisons but agreed to work on protection. He and his coworkers developed a three layer filter that absorbed all of the enemy’s gasses. Thirty million were manufactured by 1917 and Willstätter was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class.|$|R

5|$|Dobell {{launched}} the Second Battle of Gaza in April 1917 {{with a full}} scale frontal assault supported by naval gunfire, tanks and <b>poison</b> <b>gas.</b> It ended even more unsatisfactorily, and Dobell was relieved of command of Eastern Force on 19 April. His place was taken by Chetwode, while Chauvel took over the Desert Column, thereby becoming the first Australian to reach the rank of lieutenant general. Command of the Anzac Mounted Division passed to Chaytor. In June, during the Stalemate in Southern Palestine, General Sir Edmund Allenby took over the EEF from Murray. Allenby moved his headquarters to Palestine and re-organised his command along more regular lines. Eastern Force was abolished and two corps headquarters were formed, XX Corps under Chetwode and XXI Corps under Lieutenant General Edward Bulfin. The three corps commanders were professional soldiers, none of whom had graduated from a military college or a staff college, {{they had all been}} commissioned from the militia or volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Hughes, in {{his speech}} at the opening session of the conference on November 12, 1921, made the American proposal—the U.S would {{decommission}} or not build 30 warships if Great Britain did the same for 19 vessels, and Japan 17 ships. The secretary was generally successful, and agreements were reached on this and other points, including settlements to disputes over islands in the Pacific, and limitations {{on the use of}} <b>poison</b> <b>gas.</b> The naval agreement was limited to battleships and to some extent aircraft carriers, and in the end did not prevent rearmament. Nevertheless, Harding and Hughes were widely applauded in the press for their work. Harding had appointed Senator Lodge and the Senate Minority Leader, Alabama's Oscar Underwood, to the U.S. delegation; they helped ensure that the treaties made it through the Senate mostly unscathed, though that body added reservations to some of the treaties.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the ship}} Virginia Maid arrives in England from the New World, {{carrying}} the young Virginia Dare, {{the first child}} born in Roanoke colony, {{as well as her}} hulking, fair-skinned, blond Native American bodyguard Rojhaz. They are taken to meet the Queen only for a vulture-like assassin to snatch Virginia. Rojhaz quickly disables the attacker, but Virginia has transformed into a white gryphon. Rojhaz subdues Virginia, and Stephen Strange bespells her to human form before Fury sees her transformed. She has strange shapeshifting powers, and Strange suspects she is the cause of the disastrous weather. Fury interrogates one of the assassins to learn who sent him. He is told that it is Otto von Doom, ruler of Latveria, but Fury is too late to stop one of Doom's machines from killing Elizabeth with a <b>poison</b> <b>gas</b> released by dropping a pill into aqua regia.|$|E
5|$|Vergniaud {{became a}} target ship {{and was used}} to {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>poison</b> <b>gases</b> and bombs until 1926.

5|$|Ryouta, {{searching for}} a way into the medical center basement, seeks out Nageki in the library {{to ask him about}} his death. Upon {{discovering}} documents revealing that Operation Hatoful was a Hawk Party project into developing biological weapons for use against humans using the school as an experimental facility—with a focus on a strain of H5N1 almost immediately lethal to humans dubbed the Charon virus—Nageki recalls that the fire was caused by his committing suicide by self-immolation after months of forced experimentation in order to destroy and remove any trace of the virus, which was isolated in his body, and that researchers often went in through the chemistry preparation room. Ryouta, Kazuaki, and Anghel make their way into the medical center's basement through the chemistry lab and encounter Labor 9, electrocuting it using a stun gun given to Ryouta earlier by Mister One. They confront Shuu, who imprisons Kazuaki and Anghel, leaving them to die of <b>poison</b> <b>gas</b> before leading Ryouta away. Meanwhile, San comforts Sakuya, {{and the two of them}} arrive to break Anghel and Kazuaki out of the prison.|$|E
5|$|The killing {{process at}} Treblinka {{differed}} {{significantly from the}} method used at Auschwitz and Majdanek, where the <b>poison</b> <b>gas</b> Zyklon B (hydrogen cyanide) was used. At Treblinka, Sobibór, Chełmno, and Bełżec, the victims died from suffocation and carbon monoxide poisoning. After visiting Treblinka on a guided tour, Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss concluded that using exhaust gas was inferior to the cyanide used at his extermination camp. The chambers became silent after 12 minutes and were closed for 20 minutes or less. According to Jankiel Wiernik, who survived the 1943 prisoner uprising and escaped, when {{the doors of the}} gas chambers had been opened, the bodies of the dead were standing and kneeling rather than lying down, due to the severe overcrowding. Dead mothers embraced the bodies of their children. Prisoners who worked in the Sonderkommandos later testified that the dead frequently let out a last gasp of air when they were extracted from the chambers. Some victims showed signs of life during the disposal of the corpses, but the guards routinely refused to react.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorials}} to World War I {{were shaped}} by the traumatic nature of the conflict {{and its impact on}} individuals and communities. The experience of the different nations varied considerably, but common themes emerged. The war required a mass call to arms, with a significant percentage of the population mobilised to fight, either as volunteers or through conscription. Campaigns were conducted on multiple fronts across Europe and beyond. The fighting was mechanised and conducted on an industrial scale; existing weapons, such as machine guns and artillery, were combined with the innovative deployment of aircraft, submarines and <b>poison</b> <b>gas.</b> In many theatres of operation, mobile campaigns degenerated into static trench warfare, depending on the slow attrition of the enemy over many years for victory. The battles spread across larger areas than ever before, with key engagements, such as that at Verdun etched on the memories of the nations involved.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} gas masks of World War I, it was {{initially}} found that wood charcoal {{was a good}} absorbent of <b>poison</b> <b>gases.</b> Around 1918, {{it was found that}} charcoals made from the shells and seeds of various fruits and nuts such as coconuts, chestnuts, horse-chestnuts, and peach stones performed much better than wood charcoal. These waste materials were collected from the public in recycling programs to assist the war effort.|$|R
50|$|Siemienowicz {{considered}} {{the use of}} <b>poison</b> <b>gases</b> dishonorable. In his work, he wrote:"and most of all, they shall not construct any poisoned globes, nor other sorts of pyrobolic inventions, in which he shall introduce no poison whatsoever, besides which, they shall never employ them for the ruin and destruction of men, because the first inventors of our art thought such actions as unjust among themselves as unworthy of a man of heart and a real soldier.|$|R
