40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the association between}} <b>pollution</b> disclosures <b>and</b> <b>pollution</b> performance <b>and</b> between <b>pollution</b> disclosures <b>and</b> economic performance for firms in highly polluting industries. An index of pollution disclosures is developed and correlated with indices of <b>pollution</b> performance <b>and</b> economic performance. The results confirm earlier findings {{that there is no}} association between <b>pollution</b> disclosures <b>and</b> <b>pollution</b> performance. As far as the association between economic performance <b>and</b> <b>pollution</b> disclosures is concerned, the results show that the subgroup of large firms with poor economic performance provides the most detailed pollution information. For smaller firms there is no association between economic performance <b>and</b> <b>pollution</b> disclosures. ...|$|R
