2500|$|In the Bretton Woods system put {{in place}} in 1944, [...] US dollars were {{convertible}} to gold. In France, it was called [...] "America's exorbitant privilege" [...] as it resulted in an [...] "asymmetric financial system" [...] where foreigners [...] "see themselves supporting American living standards and subsidizing American multinationals". As American economist Barry Eichengreen summarized: [...] "It costs only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a $100 bill, but other countries had to <b>pony</b> <b>up</b> $100 of actual goods {{in order to obtain}} one". In February 1965 President Charles de Gaulle announced his intention to exchange its [...] US dollar reserves for gold at the official exchange rate. He sent the French Navy across the Atlantic to pick up the French reserve of gold and was followed by several countries. As it resulted in considerably reducing [...] US gold stock and [...] US economic influence, it led [...] US President Richard Nixon to unilaterally end the convertibility of the dollar to gold on 15 August 1971 (the [...] "Nixon Shock"). This {{was meant to be a}} temporary measure but the dollar became permanently a floating fiat money and in October 1976, the [...] US government officially changed the definition of the dollar; references to gold were removed from statutes.|$|E

It should also have a well-formed head and neck, sloping shoulders and prominent withers. Its back should be muscular, as should its thighs. Traditionally, the predominant color was gray, but over time and with crossbreeding, Danish Sport Ponies are also bay, chestnut, and black. Since the Danish Sport Pony {{is meant to be}} used as a mount for children, it should have a good temperament; calm and obedient.|$|R

Falk wrote that military intervention was illegal under international law, and that [...] "the Gaddafi government, however distasteful on humanitarian grounds, remains the lawful diplomatic {{representative of a}} sovereign state". Falk also wrote that any intervention would be pro-insurgency rather than counter-insurgency, and criticized politicians who supported intervention, arguing that [...] "it seems {{that many of the}} Republicans focused on the deficit although cutting public expenditures punishes the poor at a time of widespread unemployment and home foreclosures would not mind <b>ponying</b> <b>up</b> countless billions to finance acts of war in Libya".|$|R

60|$|Then {{somehow they}} slid down a bank, {{and there was}} a splash that told her the cayuse was in the water. Ingleby seemed to be {{struggling}} with the beast, but she could not make out why he did so. Nor did it seem of any moment. She was dazed and bewildered and intolerably cold. There was a further splashing, a plunge, and a flounder; the water rose to her stirrup, and for a few horrible moments she felt that the beast was going downstream with her. It was evident by the depth that they were in the Sault. She fancied she cried out in her terror and that Ingleby shouted in answer, but the roar of the river drowned the sound. In another few seconds, however, the horse apparently struck rock with its hoofs again; then the water that had lapped about her skirt seemed to fall away, and in a frantic scrambling Ingleby dragged the <b>pony</b> <b>up</b> the bank. The cayuse stood still, trembling, at the top of it, and Ingleby was apparently quivering, too, for his voice shook a little as he answered her half-coherent questions.|$|E

[...] About the character of Paula, Shriver deplores that the [...] "apologetic, alternatingly gushy and beseeching style seems artificially female—like a man's idea of a woman's voice. This is disconcerting, since Swift has crafted persuasive female characters before. But Paula is female with such a vengeance that she borders on parody. This woman is dull, trying, and signally incapable of <b>ponying</b> <b>up</b> the sharp lines and insightful asides that make a novel enjoyable along the way.

6000|$|An English officer joined {{company with}} him, and a muleteer {{undertook}} their transport to Shiraz. It {{was a terrible}} journey up the parching mountain paths of Persia, where Alexander's army had suffered so much, with the sun glaring down upon them, never, in that rainless belt around the Persian Gulf, tempered by a cloud. They travelled only by night, and encamped by day, sometimes without a tree to spread their tents under. The only mode of existing was to wrap the head in a wet cloth, and the body in all the heavy clothing to be had, to prevent the waste of moisture; but even thus Martyn says his state was [...] "a fire within my head, my skin like a cinder, the pulse violent." [...] The thermometer rose to 126 degrees {{in the middle of}} the day, and came down to about 100 degrees in the evening. When exhausted with fever and sleeplessness, but unable to touch food, it was needful to mount, and, in a half-dead state of sleepiness, be carried by the sure-footed mountain <b>pony</b> <b>up</b> steep ascents, and along the verge of giddy precipices, with a general dreamy sense that it was magnificent scenery for any one who was in a bodily condition to admire it.|$|E

I should like to see if there's another tenant besides Poyser as 'ud put up wi' never having a bit o' repairs done till a place tumbles down--and not then, on'y wi' begging and praying and having to pay half--and being strung up wi' the rent as it's much if he gets enough out o' the land to pay, for all he's put his own money into the ground beforehand. See if you'll get a stranger to lead such a life here as that: a maggot must be born i' the rotten cheese to like it, I reckon. You may run away from my words, sir," [...] continued Mrs. Poyser, following the old squire beyond the door--for after the first moments of stunned surprise he had got up, and, waving his hand towards her with a smile, had walked out towards his pony.
