5|$|Such {{measures}} impelled Pericles' {{critics to}} hold him responsible for the gradual degeneration of the Athenian democracy. Constantine Paparrigopoulos, a major modern Greek historian, argues that Pericles sought for the expansion and stabilization of all democratic institutions.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Political</b> <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> {{technology}} are interdependent and influence each other. On the one hand, <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> leaders aim at influencing the technological development and benefiting from technological progress; on the other, technological development has a considerable proportion {{of its own}} dynamics and potential to influence society <b>and</b> <b>political</b> <b>systems.</b> This chapter particularly focuses on electronic democracy and virtual communities and accordingly discusses recent ideas and plans of political leaders, derives requirements for technology, presents <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> prototypes, and reports cases demonstrating how and what technology is really used. ...|$|R
5|$|By 23BC, {{some of the}} un-Republican {{implications}} {{were becoming}} apparent concerning the settlement of 27BC. Augustus' retention of an annual consulate drew attention to his de facto dominance over the Roman <b>political</b> <b>system,</b> <b>and</b> cut in half the opportunities for others to achieve what was still nominally the preeminent position in the Roman state. Further, he was causing political problems by desiring to have his nephew Marcus Claudius Marcellus follow in his footsteps and eventually assume the Principate in his turn, alienating his three greatest supporters– Agrippa, Maecenas, and Livia. Feeling pressure from his core group of adherents, Augustus turned to the Senate for help.|$|E
5|$|Edward's grandson, {{the young}} Richard II, faced {{political}} and economic problems, many resulting from the Black Death, including the Peasants' Revolt that broke out across the south of England in 1381. Over the coming decades, Richard and groups of nobles vied for power and control of policy towards France until Henry of Bolingbroke seized the throne {{with the support of}} parliament in 1399. Ruling as Henry IV, he exercised power through a royal council and parliament, while attempting to enforce political and religious conformity. His son, Henry V, reinvigorated the war with France and came close to achieving strategic success shortly before his death in 1422. Henry VI became king at the age of only nine months and both the English <b>political</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> the military situation in France began to unravel.|$|E
5|$|The {{years of}} {{conflict}} which {{resulted from the}} Theban attempts to reorganise Greece had left {{much of the country}} war-weary and exhausted; a general peace (excluding only a recalcitrant Sparta) was therefore concluded between all the states of Greece in the aftermath of Mantinea. With the death of Epaminondas and significant loss of manpower at Mantinea, the Thebans returned to their more traditional defensive policy, and within a few years, Athens had replaced them at the pinnacle of the Greek <b>political</b> <b>system,</b> <b>and</b> Theban influence faded quickly in the rest of Greece. It was the Athenians, and their second confederacy, who would be Macedon's main rivals for control of the lands of the north Aegean, and a major theme during the period was the regular state of war between Macedon and Athens.|$|E

5|$|In the Junta, Alberti {{was aligned}} {{with most of}} the reformist {{proposals}} of Mariano Moreno, as well as Juan Larrea and Juan José Castelli. He signed most of the rulings that shaped the new political system, such as those related to popular sovereignty, representative and republican principles, separation of powers, publicity of the government actions, freedom of speech and the bases of political federalism. However, he did not support the actions of the Junta that contradicted his religious formation, regardless of the context. He refused to sign the death penalty for Santiago de Liniers, captured after the defeat of his counter-revolution. He signed the harsh commands given to Castelli for the first Upper Peru campaign, but noticing next to his signature that he made an exception with the articles involving capital punishment. He was also concerned by the role of the church in the new <b>political</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> headed a dispute against the Cabildo about it. He considered that the Cabildo should not have any authority over the Junta in ecclesiastic topics, to prevent the former abuses of the absolutist governments.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} Latin American intellectuals, Vargas Llosa was {{initially}} {{a supporter of}} the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro. He studied Marxism in depth as a university student and was later persuaded by communist ideals after the success of the Cuban Revolution. Gradually, Vargas Llosa came to believe that socialism was incompatible with what he considered to be general liberties and freedoms. The official rupture between the writer and the policies of the Cuban government occurred with the so-called 'Padilla Affair', when the Castro regime imprisoned the poet Heberto Padilla for a month in 1971. Vargas Llosa, along with other intellectuals of the time, wrote to Castro protesting the Cuban <b>political</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> its imprisonment of the artist. Vargas Llosa has identified himself with liberalism rather than extreme left-wing political ideologies ever since. Since he relinquished his earlier leftism, he has opposed both left- and right-wing authoritarian regimes.|$|E

25|$|Democrats 66 {{was founded}} on 14 October 1966 by 44 people. Its founders were {{described}} as homines novi, although 25 of the 44 had previously been members of a political party. The initiators were Hans van Mierlo, a journalist for the Algemeen Handelsblad and Hans Gruijters, a municipal councillor in Amsterdam. Van Mierlo became the party's political leader and Gruijters the party's chair. The foundation of the party was preceded by the Appeal 1966 on October 10, in which the founders appealed {{to the people of}} the Netherlands to re-take their democratic institutions. The party renounced the 19th-century political ideologies, which dominated the <b>political</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> wanted to end pillarisation. It called for radical democratisation of the Dutch society and its <b>political</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> it called for pragmatic and scientific policy-making.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the influence of}} <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> rights in patterns of agricultural protection across commodities, countries, and over time. Four <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> a qualitative index of political rights account for differences in political institutions. The analysis incorporates the effects of development, of constraints on tax collection feasibility, and of comparative advantages and terms of trade. Pluralistic systems are associated with higher agricultural protection levels, although in a nonlinear fashion. Access to pluralism appears to be important, although further democratization partly dissipates protection. Copyright 1994 by MIT Press. ...|$|R

40|$|Extant {{research}} {{on the relationship between}} <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> state punitiveness has so far paid little attention to the impact that transition from one <b>political</b> <b>system</b> to another may have upon levels and patterns of state punitiveness.

25|$|To {{integrate}} immigrants {{into the}} Dutch society, each person {{who wants to}} immigrate into the Netherlands must pass an integration test, except for those who come from other European Union-member states, United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand (such immigrants must still take a year of integration classes after entry). It tests knowledge of the Dutch language, <b>political</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> social conventions. The test must be taken before entering the Netherlands, preferably in a Dutch embassy in the person's country of origin.

25|$|African Americans {{emerged from}} the Civil War with the {{political}} experience and stature to resist attacks, but disfranchisement and imposition of Jim Crow in the South {{at the turn of}} the 20th century closed them out of the <b>political</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> judicial system in many ways. Advocacy organizations compiled statistics and publicized the atrocities, as well as working for enforcement of civil rights and a federal anti-lynching law. From the early 1880s, the Chicago Tribune reprinted accounts of lynchings from other newspapers, and published annual statistics. These provided the main source for the compilations by the Tuskegee Institute to document lynchings, a practice it continued until 1968.|$|E
