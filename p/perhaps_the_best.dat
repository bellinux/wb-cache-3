5|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known herbals were {{produced}} in Europe between 1470 and 1670. The invention in Germany of {{printing from movable type}} in a printing press c. 1440 {{was a great}} stimulus to herbalism. The new herbals were more detailed with greater general appeal and often with Gothic script and the addition of woodcut illustrations that more closely resembled the plants being described.|$|E
5|$|The {{so-called}} discoverer of Cleveland Ironstone, {{the mining}} engineer John Vaughan, ran a rolling mill {{for the company}} before leaving to found the major rival firm Bolckow Vaughan. The other key figure in the company was Lowthian Bell, son of Thomas Bell; he became <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known ironmaster in England.|$|E
5|$|According to many observers, {{including}} Ray Ferraro {{and teammates}} Brendan Gallagher and Connor McDavid, Tanev was <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> defenceman {{in the tournament}} {{in terms of his}} defensive play - he and his defence partner, Morgan Rielly, were not on the ice for a single goal against at even-strength. Tanev also played a major role on Canada’s tournament-best penalty kill that allowed just two goals against in 29 opportunities. He registered one assist during the tournament.|$|E

5|$|English {{folklore}} {{developed over}} many centuries. Some {{of the characters}} and stories are present across England, but most belong to specific regions. Common folkloric beings include pixies, giants, elves, bogeymen, trolls, goblins and dwarves. While many legends and folk-customs {{are thought to be}} ancient, for instance the tales featuring Offa of Angel and Wayland the Smith, others date from after the Norman invasion; Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood and their battles with the Sheriff of Nottingham being, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known.|$|E
5|$|Historian James Gunn's {{assessment}} of Amazing in the 1980s is that Mavor, Scithers and Price, who between them edited Amazing for a decade, {{were unable to}} sustain the standards established by Ted White in the 1970s. Brian Stableford, by contrast, comments that both Scithers and Price made efforts to publish good material, and that the packaging, from 1991 onwards, was <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> presented of any science fiction magazine.|$|E
5|$|Mobile's French and Spanish colonial {{history has}} {{given it a}} culture {{distinguished}} by French, Spanish, Creole, African and Catholic heritage, in addition to later British and American influences. It is distinguished from all other cities {{in the state of}} Alabama. The annual Carnival celebration is <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> example of its differences. Mobile is the birthplace of the celebration of Mardi Gras in the United States and has the oldest celebration, dating to the early 18th century during the French colonial period.|$|E

5|$|No written {{contemporary}} {{description of}} Shakespeare's physical appearance survives, and no {{evidence suggests that}} he ever commissioned a portrait, so the Droeshout engraving, which Ben Jonson approved of as a good likeness, and his Stratford monument provide <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> evidence of his appearance. From the 18th century, the desire for authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare. That demand also led {{to the production of}} several fake portraits, as well as misattributions, repaintings, and relabelling of portraits of other people.|$|E
5|$|However, Shakespeare {{soon began}} to adapt the {{traditional}} styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III {{has its roots in}} the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays. No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with Romeo and Juliet <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> example of the mixing of the styles. By the time of Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and A Midsummer Night's Dream in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Dodson raised two {{objections}} to Horner's hypothesis. Firstly, {{the possession of}} just one pair of main spikes seemed more basal than the presence of three pairs, as with Styracosaurus albertensis. This suggested {{to him that the}} Einiosaurus-Achelousaurus lineage was a separate branch within the Centrosaurinae. Secondly, he was concerned that Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus were a case of sexual dimorphism, one type being the males, the other the females. This would be suggested by the short geological time interval between the layers their fossils had been found in, which was estimated by him at about 250,000 years. But if the hypothesis were true, it would be <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> example of fast evolution in the Dinosauria.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the architects}} {{training}} and working in Douglas's office were influenced by him. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known of these were Edmund Kirby and Edward Ould. Kirby is best remembered for his Roman Catholic churches. Ould went on to design a number of buildings in Chester and further afield in a Douglas-like style, including notably Wightwick Manor and various buildings at Port Sunlight. Other architects who did not work in his office were also influenced by him; these include Thomas Lockwood, Richard Thomas Beckett, Howard Hignett, A. E. Powers, James Strong and the Cheshire County Architect, Henry Beswick.|$|E
5|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known nativity {{scene in}} America is the Neapolitan Baroque Crèche {{displayed}} {{annually in the}} Medieval Sculpture Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Its backdrop is a 1763 choir screen from the Cathedral of Valladolid and a twenty-foot blue spruce decorated {{with a host of}} 18th-century angels. The nativity figures are placed at the tree's base. The crèche was the gift of Loretta Hines Howard in 1964, and the choir screen was the gift of The William Randolph Hearst Foundation in 1956. Both this presepio and the one displayed in Pittsburgh originated from the collection of Eugenio Catello.|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{advanced}} to the NBA Finals {{for the first time}} in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers, who had Magic Johnson and James Worthy, two formidable opponents. The Bulls won the series four games to one, and compiled an outstanding 15–2 playoff record along the way. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket. In his first Finals appearance, Jordan posted per game averages of 31.2 points on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 assists, 6.6 rebounds, 2.8 steals, and 1.4 blocks. Jordan won his first NBA Finals MVP award, and he cried while holding the NBA Finals trophy.|$|E

5|$|The pieces {{relating}} to Ireland {{are those of}} a public nature; in which the Dean appears, as usual, in the best light, because they do honour to his heart {{as well as to}} his head; furnishing some additional proofs, that, though he was very free in his abuse of the inhabitants of that country, as well natives as foreigners, he had their interest sincerely at heart, and perfectly understood it. His sermon upon Doing Good, though peculiarly adapted to Ireland and Wood's designs upon it, contains <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> motives to patriotism that were ever delivered within so small a compass.|$|E
5|$|While {{balloons}} are <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known use of helium, {{they are}} a minor part of all helium use. Helium is used for many purposes that require some of its unique properties, such as its low boiling point, low density, low solubility, high thermal conductivity, or inertness. Of the 2014 world helium total production of about 32 million kg (180 million standard cubic meters) helium per year, the largest use (about 32% of the total in 2014) is in cryogenic applications, most of which involves cooling the superconducting magnets in medical MRI scanners and NMR spectrometers. Other major uses were pressurizing and purging systems, welding, maintenance of controlled atmospheres, and leak detection. Other uses by category were relatively minor fractions.|$|E
5|$|The version by Aiken is <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known stage adaptation, {{released}} just a {{few months}} after the novel was published. This six-act behemoth also set an important precedent by being the first show on Broadway to stand on its own, without the performance of other entertainments or any afterpiece. Most of Aiken's dialogue is lifted verbatim from Stowe's novel and it included four full musical numbers written by the producer, George C. Howard. Another legacy of this adaptation is its reliance upon very different locations all portrayed on the same stage. This reliance led to large sets and set a precedent for the future days of film. By focusing on the stark and desperate situations of his characters, Aiken appealed to the emotions of his audiences. By combining this melodramatic approach with the content of Stowe's novel, Aiken helped to create a powerful visual indictment against the institution of slavery.|$|E

5|$|As Khalid was the {{architect}} {{of most of the}} early Muslim military doctrines, he was also the pioneer of almost every major tactic that Muslims used during Early Islamic conquests. One of Khalid's major achievements in this context was utilizing the individual skills of Arab Bedouin warriors to a larger scale. He is believed to have developed them into an almost regular unit called Mubarizun ("champions"), who would issue personal challenges to the enemy officers. These were highly trained and skilled swordsmen, whom Khalid utilized effectively to slay as many enemy officers as possible, giving a psychological blow to enemy morale. The Battle of Ajnadayn is <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> example of this form of psychological warfare. Moreover, his biggest achievement was the conversion of Arab tactical doctrine into a strategic system. Until Khalid, the Arabs were basically raiders and skirmishers. Khalid turned those skirmishing tactics into something that could be used anywhere. Thus he would skirmish the enemy to death: he would bring his army in front of his enemies and wait until the whole battle degenerated into a skirmishing affair between small units. Then, after exhausting the enemy units, he would launch his cavalry at their flanks employing Hammer and Anvil tactics.|$|E
