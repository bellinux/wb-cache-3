40|$|An {{automated}} {{leak test}} system for tritium shipping containers {{has been developed}} at Westinghouse Savannah River Co. (WSRC). The leak detection system employs a computer controlled helium detector which allows an operator to enter key information when prompted. The software for controlling the tests and the equipment apparatus were both designed and manufactured at the Savannah River Technology Center within WSRC. Recertification Test: Every twelve months, the <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> portion of the shipping container itself must undergo a rigorous recertification leak test. After an empty <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> (shipping <b>container)</b> is assembled, it is placed into one of six stainless steel belljars for helium leak testing. The belljars are fashioned in row {{much the same as}} assembly line arrangement. Post-load Test: A post-load leak test is performed upon reservoirs that have been filled with tritium and placed inside the shipping containers mentioned above. These leak tests are performed by a rate-of-rise method where the area around the shipping container seals is evacuated, valved off from the vacuum pump, and then the vacuum pressure is monitored over a two-minute period. The Post Load Leak Test is a quality verification test to ensure that the shipping container has been correctly assembled. 2 figs...|$|R
