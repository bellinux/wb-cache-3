A decade-long state of oversupply underpinned this result and while <b>plant</b> <b>capital</b> costs had been rising, the cost of capital had been declining.

40|$|Abstract—The {{utilization}} {{of renewable energy}} sources in electric power systems is increasing quickly because of public apprehensions for unpleasant environmental impacts and increase in the energy costs involved {{with the use of}} conventional energy sources. Despite the application of these energy sources can considerably diminish the system fuel costs, they can also have significant influence on the system reliability. Therefore an appropriate combination of the system reliability indices level and capital investment costs of system is vital.

50|$|Because of {{the large}} capital costs for the initial nuclear power plants built {{as part of a}} {{sustained}} build program, and the relatively long construction period before revenue is returned, servicing the capital costs of first few nuclear power plants can be the most important factor determining the economic competitiveness of nuclear energy. The investment can contribute about 70% to 80% of the costs of electricity. The discount rate chosen to cost a nuclear power <b>plant's</b> <b>capital</b> over its lifetime is arguably the most sensitive parameter to overall costs. Because of the long life of new nuclear power plants, most of the value of a new nuclear power plant is created for the benefit of future generations.|$|R

This volatility complicates analysis of potential <b>plant</b> <b>capital</b> investments to reduce energy usage, in particular those that involve consideration of alternate energy sources, since traditional financial investment valuation assumes that future cash flows are known exactly. Yet, this is clearly not the case for many energy saving investments. In addition, future price probability functions may be best characterized as non symmetric and economic objective functions as non-linear further complicating investment analysis. Failure to recognize these effects can result in incorrectly valuing the potential financial return of the investment.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{employs a}} Monte Carlo based {{decision-support}} tool {{to assess the}} expected overall generation costs and risks of different thermal plant portfolios with high wind power penetrations. In particular, we present {{a case study of}} an electricity industry with Coal, CCGT, OCGT and Wind generation options that faces uncertain future fuel prices, carbon pricing, demand, and <b>plant</b> <b>capital</b> costs. The tool uses half-hourly demand and wind generation data from South Eastern Australia, and Australian estimates of new-build thermal plant costs. It incorporates a Monte-Carlo extension to standard optimal generation mix methods combined with risk weighting techniques from portfolio theory. The implications of different wind penetration levels on the expected costs and risks, and associated emissions of different thermal plant portfolios are explored. Results from the case study highlight the potentially complex interactions between high levels of intermittent generation and the costs, risks and emissions of future electricity industries with different portfolios of Coal and Gas-fired plants.

40|$|An unusual {{consensus}} {{has developed}} among economists that the ‘long boom’ before 2008, {{and the subsequent}} crisis and recession, resulted from a global excess of capital. Over-supply of saving drive down capital costs, encouraging excessively risky investment and preventing the scrapping of outmoded <b>plant.</b> <b>Capital’s</b> inexorable growth is also blamed for a prolonged squeeze on wages, rising elite wealth and worsening global inequality. This book explores the obvious clash between such arguments and actual measurements of capital, which show a small and shrinking ‘productive’ component, and a deepening disconnection between capital accumulation and economic growth. It traces the conflict to the continued absence of consistent definitions or measurements of capital, and neglect of the complex connection between aggregate capital and wealth. Capital ‘gains’ and ‘losses’, and the growing domination of income statements by balance sheets, undermine attempts to sidestep the problem by reconstituting economics as a system of flows...|$|R
