25|$|Bring Me the Horizon {{then moved}} even {{further away from}} deathcore in their third album There Is a Hell, with the {{incorporation}} of electronica, classical music and <b>pop</b> <b>into</b> their metalcore style. This required more ambitious production feats, such as using a full choir, a synthesised orchestra and glitched out vocals and breakdowns (that were also toned down, favouring quiet atmospheric passages in song breaks). For the writing of Sempiternal, the band pooled far broader influences such as post-rock acts like This Will Destroy You and Explosions In The Sky and from pop music.|$|E
25|$|Shania Twain {{became the}} best selling female country {{artist of the}} decade. This was {{primarily}} due {{to the success of}} her breakthrough sophomore 1995 album, The Woman in Me, which was certified 12x platinum sold over 20 million copies worldwide and its follow up, 1997's Come On Over, which was certified 20x platinum and sold over 40 million copies. The album became a major worldwide phenomenon and became one of the world's best selling albums of 1998, 1999 and 2000; it also {{went on to become the}} best selling country album of all time. Unlike the majority of her contemporaries, Twain enjoyed large international success that had been seen by very few country artists, before or after her. Critics have noted that Twain enjoyed much of her success due to breaking free of traditional country stereotypes and for incorporating elements of rock and <b>pop</b> <b>into</b> her music. In 2002, she released her successful fourth studio album, titled Up!, which was certified 11x platinum and sold over 15 million copies worldwide. Twain has been credited with breaking international boundaries for country music, as well as inspiring many country artists to incorporate different genres into their music in order to attract a wider audience. She is also credited with changing the way in which many female country performers would market themselves, as unlike many before her she used fashion and her sex appeal to get rid of the stereotypical 'honky-tonk' image the majority of country singers had in order to distinguish herself from many female country artists of the time.|$|E
500|$|Mehldau's trio was, in Hobart's words, [...] "the first {{successfully}} to add post-Beatles <b>pop</b> <b>into</b> the jazz repertoire without trivialising either", and shifted the [...] "traditional emphasis on bravura technique and group dynamics [...] to {{a focus on}} subtleties of touch and where-my-fancy-takes-me musings." [...] Such differences in repertoire and approach became common in small-group jazz. His combining of right- and left-hand playing, {{moving away from the}} more typical right-hand dominated playing, also influenced pianists.|$|E

500|$|... "Sober" [...] is a midtempo synthpop power ballad, which {{incorporates}} {{elements of}} electro, R and <b>pop</b> <b>into</b> its production. The [...] "booming" [...] and [...] "emotive" [...] track features a big, 1980's-influenced song structure. Its [...] "studded" [...] and [...] "shimmering" [...] production consists of [...] "chunky" [...] "insistent" [...] percussive beats, hand-claps, and dark 80's-influenced synthesizers. The chorus {{is characterized by}} [...] "catchy" [...] shimmering vocal melodies, [...] "insistent" [...] drums, [...] "slamming" [...] synth stabs, and [...] "girlie" [...] yelps. During the intro and outro of [...] "Sober", the producers utilize a digitally manipulated, chopped and screwed vocal sample.|$|E
500|$|Patton {{had also}} been {{inspired}} by the music of Italian composer Ennio Morricone. Patton's record label Ipecac Recordings had previously released Crime and Dissonance, a two-disc retrospective of Morricone's work. The singer has described his admiration for Morricone's writing, feeling that the composer turned [...] "what could be banal, surface-style <b>pop</b> <b>into</b> really deep, orchestrated, tense and compelling music". Several of the album's songs had been written by Morricone, including [...] "Deep Down", written for the 1968 Mario Bava film [...] Patton had {{been aware of the}} song for some time, having been a fan of the film and Morricone's score; however, the two musicians have not actually met or worked together before.|$|E
500|$|Patton, {{founder of}} Ipecac Recordings, has {{described}} {{his admiration for}} Morricone's writing, feeling that the composer turned [...] "what could be banal, surface-style <b>pop</b> <b>into</b> really deep, orchestrated, tense and compelling music". Patton considers Morricone {{to be one of}} his favorite composers, and wanted the compilation to serve as a fitting tribute. He felt it was [...] "imperative" [...] for Crime and Dissonance to focus on Morricone's lesser-known work, as it had to compete with a large back catalogue of similar compilations. To this end, Patton and Bishop focused on Morricone's more experimental work, which Patton has compared to the music of Brazilian tropicália group Os Mutantes. Patton has praised Bishop's work on the project, calling him [...] "a big Morricone scholar", and has described Crime and Dissonance as one the Ipecac releases he is most proud of.|$|E

500|$|... "Boiling", {{which starts}} The Face, {{opens with a}} R-infused {{landscape}} of [...] "bruised color" [...] synths, which are mostly associated with the works of future garage artists such as Jacques Greene, backing alto vocals by Sinéad Harnett. Big keyboard sounds, a deep house bassline, percussion including finger snaps and hi-hats commonly found in early 1990s garage music then <b>pop</b> <b>into</b> the song, as well as reverb effects on the vocals, before some bubbly synth textures [...] "unravel" [...] the song. [...] "What's In Your Head" [...] contains chops of high-pitched voice samples, a [...] "distorted-beyond-recognition orgasm sample," [...] and [...] "spacey" [...] "sun-bleached" [...] synthesizers. The later part of the track consists of a harsh drum beat, stuttering vocal chops and [...] "vamping" [...] synth lines. According to The 405's James West, the song includes pop music elements {{similar to those in}} Be Strong, an album by duo The 2 Bears. Writing for Resident Advisor, Phillip Sherburne described the song's vocal snippets as cleaner versions of those found in the 1997 track [...] "Fly Life" [...] by Basement Jaxx.|$|E
500|$|With {{a variety}} of writers and {{producers}} and its new musical direction for Carey, the album was always {{likely to be a}} commercial success. Carey and Combs wrote the lead single, [...] "Honey." [...] Combs believed this to be a good song but was uncertain how successful it would be as a release owing to its heavy hip hop influence. The remix for [...] "Honey" [...] featured rapping lead vocals from Da Brat, The LOX and Mase, and some verses were rapped by Combs himself. The track was very different from Carey's previous recordings, and was described by author Chris Nickson as [...] "street Hip-Hop music, with a booming bass." [...] The song's melody was driven by Q-Tip's drum programming and Stevie J's keyboard notes. Combs's production gave the song a [...] "light and airy" [...] effect, further distancing it from Carey's contemporary sound. [...] "Honey" [...] featured musical samples from Treacherous Three's [...] "The Body Rock", and [...] "Hey DJ" [...] by The World's Famous Supreme Team. The track used both hip hop and R with traces of pop music and was described as a [...] " [...] catchy chorus, combining hip hop and <b>pop</b> <b>into</b> something that simply wasn't going to be denied by anyone, and offering a powerful start to a record." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Work" [...] was {{positively}} reviewed by writers of Entertainment Weekly; Kyle Anderson opined that the track was [...] "a thoroughbred {{entry in the}} song of summer race", while Ray Rahman called it a [...] "bulletproof party banger". Devone Jones of PopMatters viewed Azalea's [...] "sombre thought-processing" [...] as [...] "well-executed", and appreciated her for [...] "picking gritty [...] beats over EDM and dance music as well as deciding to rap about her life before her new-found fame as opposed to her fame". Likewise, Craig Mathieson of The Sydney Morning Herald explained that the song highlighted Azalea's [...] "ability to meld the club music sounds that are permeating American hip-hop and <b>pop</b> <b>into</b> something unexpected and affecting". In an October 2013 publication, Kitty Empire of The Observer wrote that [...] "Work" [...] was [...] "ear-catching", and contained Azalea's [...] "best-known zing"; [...] "Valley girls giving blowjobs for Louboutins / What do you call that? / Head over heels?". In 2014, Nolan Feeney of Time said [...] "Work" [...] was [...] "by far the best thing she's done", and highlighted Azalea's conviction and [...] "rapid-fire" [...] delivery, while Digital Spy's Lewis Corner felt the song [...] "remains one of [...] finest moments". In 2015, NME ranked [...] "Work" [...] third in their list of Azalea's best songs, behind [...] "Fancy" [...] and [...] "1 800 Bone".|$|E

2500|$|The {{music critic}} Johnny Loftus wrote, [...] "Rock critics usually reserve {{a special place}} for Deftones above or at least away {{from the rest of}} the turn-of-the-century metal {{movement}} [...] Deftones have always seemed more curious, more willing to incorporate traditionally revered sounds like D.C. hardcore and dream <b>pop</b> <b>into</b> their Northern California alt-metal". Peter Buckley, the author of The Rough Guide to Rock, called the band [...] "one of the most primal, powerful, and experimental" [...] bands in the alternative metal scene.|$|E

The group's third album, Celebrity Skin, incorporated power <b>pop</b> <b>into</b> their hard rock sound, and was heavily inspired by California bands; Love was also influenced by Fleetwood Mac and My Bloody Valentine while writing the album. The group's 2010 release, Nobody's Daughter, featured a more folk rock-oriented sound, utilizing acoustic guitar and softer melodies.|$|E
