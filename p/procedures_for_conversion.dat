25|$|The ancestry of most American Jews {{goes back}} to Ashkenazi Jewish {{communities}} that immigrated to the US {{in the course of}} the 19th and 20th centuries, as well as more recent influxes of Persian and other Mizrahi Jewish immigrants. The American Jewish community is considered to contain the highest percentage of mixed marriages between Jews and non-Jews, resulting in both increased assimilation and a significant influx of non-Jews becoming identified as Jews. The most widespread practice in the U.S is Reform Judaism, which doesn't require or see the Jews as direct descendants of the ethnic Jews or Biblical Israelites, but rather adherents of the Jewish faith in its Reformist version, in contrast to Orthodox Judaism, the mainstream practice in Israel, which considers the Jews as a closed ethnoreligious community with very strict <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>conversion.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A well {{established}} advantage of using contrast-enhanced CT in dual-modality PET/CT imaging is the possibil-ity to obtain diagnostic quality CT images, thus allowing to increase patient throughput and reduce patient absorbed dose. However, {{the use of}} CT data following intravenous (IV) injec-tion of contrast media for attenuation correction might bias the attenuation-map (µmap) and generate visible artifacts on reconstructed PET images owing to the misclassification of contrast-medium with high density bone when using standard <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>conversion</b> of CT numbers to linear attenuation coefficients at 511 keV.

Despite the recommendations made by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) in 1967 [1] and 1979 [2], and the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1977 [3], to use molar units to report clinical laboratory data, many countries have not yet made a commitment to do this. However, the situation may change in the near future: Australia, Scandinavia and the United Kingdom have been largely committed to the recommended SI units, with a variablecommitment in the remainder of Europe, ranging from virtually 100 % in Switzerland to 20 % in Italy and 5 % in Germany. Canada converted in 1982 and the USA plans {{to do so in the}} future [4].

Delimiting the object of study for understanding the conversion of analog bibliographic records to MARC 21 Bibliographic format, from the syntactic and semantic analysis of records described in patterns of descriptive metadata structure and content standards. The thesis of this research is that the syntactic and semantic principles of bibliographic records, defined by schemas describing and cataloging the display, in the standards of descriptive metadata structure and content standards, determine the process of converting bibliographic records MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic. Based on this context, the proposition of this research is to develop a theoretical study of the syntax and semantics of bibliographic records, by the Linguistic bias, with Saussure and Hjelmslev, which subsidize the conversion of analog bibliographic records to MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic a computational interpreter. With this proposal, it is stated, as a general goal, develop a theoretical-conceptual model of syntax and semantics in bibliographic records from Saussureano hjelmslevianos and linguistic studies of the manifestations of human language, which is applicable to a computational interpreter aimed to conversion bibliographic records to MARC 21 Bibliographic format. To reach this goal it is through the following specific objectives, divided in two groups and directed respectively to the theoretical-conceptual model of syntactic structure and semantics of bibliographic records, and the conversion of their records process: explain the relationship between syntax and semantics of bibliographic in the light of linguistic aspects studied by Saussure and Hjelmslev, applicable to analog and digital media records; submit characteristic principles of syntax and semantics in bibliographic records; look through the available literature, the methods and <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>conversion</b> of bibliographic records to MARC 21 Bibliographic format; set method of image processing bibliographic records in analog optical character recognition (OCR) software; present computational interpretation technique that is focused on the conversion of analog bibliographic records to MARC 21 Bibliographic Format to consider the syntactic and semantic schemas. In view of the outlined objectives, the methodological approach of the research is based on a qualitative approach, exploratory, descriptive and experimental basis and uses the literature. As a result, it is expected to contribute significantly to the Information Science Similarly, considering social, inherent in human knowledge and the solution of the problem presented aspects. The greatest social benefit occasioned by this research relates closely, the aspects of sharing bibliographic records, and the possibility of extending access to the metadata of information resources represented by the various units of information. Contributions theoretically can be glimpsed on the development of issues related to syntactic and semantic aspects of bibliographic records, and involve, at one time, the interdisciplinary Information Science, Computer Science and Linguistics.
