40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} process by which conservation <b>photographers</b> do conservation photography as they generate visual material as part of environmental social change initiatives. Using interviews, I study <b>photographers</b> associated with the International League of Conservation <b>Photographers.</b> Focusing on {{the process by}} which <b>photographers</b> do culture, I examine the boundaries that <b>photographers</b> invoke in their work, how the <b>photographers</b> became conservation <b>photographers,</b> how conservation <b>photographers</b> manage tensions among logics in their work, and how conservation <b>photographers</b> relate to emerging technologies. I demonstrate that technological and economic changes create tensions among professional <b>photographers</b> who attempt to integrate social change efforts into their professional work. This dissertation shows the importance of considering occupational identity when studying individuals who engage in social change activities...|$|R
