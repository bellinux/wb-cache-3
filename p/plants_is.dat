50|$|Male {{and female}} flowers of the hop plant usually develop on {{separate}} <b>plants</b> (that <b>is,</b> the <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> dioecious), although fertile monoecious individuals appear occasionally. Because viable seeds are undesirable for brewing beer, only female <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> grown in hop fields, thus preventing pollination. Female <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> propagated vegetatively, and male <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> culled if <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> grown from seeds.|$|R

50|$|This <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> first {{collected}} in the 19th century and was not seen again until 1993, when a single <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> found. Three more were found later that year. Four additional <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> found in 1999 and five immature <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> located in 2001. There may be up to fifty plants remaining in unsurveyed areas.|$|R
5|$|Although early humans {{gathered}} uncultivated {{plant materials}} {{for food and}} employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing, most modern human use of <b>plants</b> <b>is</b> through agriculture. The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth {{has led to a}} significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.|$|E
5|$|Another myth {{surrounding}} this species {{is that it}} occasionally catches small monkeys and other large animals in its pitchers. Such tales have persisted {{for a very long}} time, but can probably be explained as rodents being mistaken for other species. It {{is interesting to note that}} one common name for Nepenthes <b>plants</b> <b>is</b> 'Monkey Cups'. The name refers to the fact that monkeys have been observed drinking rainwater from these plants.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine-derived melanin {{probably}} {{appears in}} at least some other biological systems as well. Some of the dopamine in <b>plants</b> <b>is</b> likely {{to be used as a}} precursor for dopamine-melanin. The complex patterns that appear on butterfly wings, as well as black-and-white stripes on the bodies of insect larvae, are also thought to be caused by spatially structured accumulations of dopamine-melanin.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1860–1948) {{published}} his book On Growth and Form. His description of phyllotaxis and the Fibonacci sequence, the mathematical {{relationships in the}} spiral growth patterns of <b>plants,</b> <b>is</b> classic. He showed that simple equations could describe all the apparently complex spiral growth patterns of animal horns and mollusc shells.|$|E
5|$|One {{prevailing}} {{idea is that}} carnivory in <b>plants</b> <b>is</b> not a {{black and}} white duality, but rather a spectrum from strict non-carnivorous photoautotrophs (a rose, for example) to fully carnivorous plants with active trapping mechanisms like those of Dionaea or Aldrovanda. However, passive traps are still considered fully carnivorous. Plants that fall between the definitions in the strict carnivorous/non-carnivorous demarcation can be defined as being protocarnivorous.|$|E
5|$|There are 27 known populations {{within this}} region, but only nine of these populations contain more than 10 {{individual}} plants, and only five populations {{have more than}} 100.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} Cereal Crops Research Institute Pirsabak Nowshera during 2002 - 03 on six wheat cultivars/advance lines to identify the best suitable time of planting in the central agro-ecological zone of NWFP. Randomized complete block design was used with 3 replications. Six <b>planting</b> dates <b>were</b> used from October 25 th to December 15 th with 10 days increment. Data were recorded on Days to 50 % heading, Days to maturity, Plant height and Grain yield. Maximum number of days (132) to 50 % heading <b>were</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on October 25 th Minimum number of days (114) <b>were</b> reported when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on December, 15 th. Maximum number of days (178) to maturity <b>were</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on October 25 th. Number of days to maturity decreased as <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed with 10 days increment. Minimum number of days (130) <b>were</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed till 15 th of December. Highest plant height (98 cm) <b>was</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on October 25 th and November 05 th. Plant Height decreased as <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed. Minimum <b>Plant</b> height (85 cm) <b>was</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed till 15 th of December. Maximum grain yield (3937 kg ha - 1) <b>was</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on November 05 th. Grain yield decreased as <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed with 10 days increment. Minimum grain yield (2274 kg ha - 1) <b>was</b> observed when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on 15 th of December. A negative correlation <b>was</b> recorded between <b>planting</b> dates and days to 50 % heading, days to maturity, Plant height and Grain yield. The yield losses due to late <b>planting</b> recorded <b>were</b> 8 % when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on November 15 th, 22 % loss when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on 25 th November, 34 % losses <b>were</b> incurred when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on December 5 th and 42 % losses <b>were</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> further delayed till December 15 th.

5|$|This {{being the}} case, however, {{it appears that}} the genetic {{variability}} of cultivated N. rajah <b>plants</b> <b>is</b> very small, as all commercially available tissue-cultured plants are thought to belong to just four clones originating from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London, England.|$|E
5|$|Typhula quisquiliaris fruit {{bodies are}} {{typically}} found in rows, growing from plant detritus. The species favours bracken, especially Pteridium aquilinum, but the colonisation of dead matter from other <b>plants</b> <b>is</b> not unknown. Upon these substrates, it feeds as a saprotroph, {{breaking down the}} dead organic matter in order to sustain itself. The species has been recorded in Europe and northern Africa. In Europe, the fruit bodies can be encountered from April to December.|$|E
5|$|A {{good example}} of {{convergence}} in <b>plants</b> <b>is</b> the evolution of edible fruits such as apples. These pomes incorporate (five) carpels and their accessory tissues forming the apple's core, surrounded by structures from outside the botanical fruit, the receptacle or hypanthium. Other edible fruits include other plant tissues; for example, the fleshy part of a tomato is {{the walls of the}} pericarp. This implies convergent evolution under selective pressure, in this case the competition for seed dispersal by animals through consumption of fleshy fruits.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 {{the once}} {{widespread}} but now rare tall thrift <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> discovered in Ancaster churchyard, {{one of only}} two locations within the country where the <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> found.

5|$|Armillaria species form fleshy, white-spored {{mushrooms}} with a cottony or membranous veil {{that typically}} forms a distinct annulus on the stem. The fruit bodies usually occur in autumn in large clusters {{at the base}} of the stem or roots. Armillaria species can produce rhizomorphs—rootlike aggregations of hyphae—that can form massive, long-lasting underground networks. The growth of the rhizomorph networks allows for tree-to-tree spread of the fungus even when direct contact between diseased and healthy <b>plants</b> <b>is</b> not possible.|$|E
5|$|Basalt, mostly {{covered by}} silt in the uplands and {{sediment}} in the lowlands, underlies the Balch Creek watershed. The {{upper part of}} the watershed includes private residential land, the Audubon Society of Portland nature sanctuary, and part of Forest Park. Mixed conifer forest of Coast Douglas-fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock with a well-developed understory of shrubs and flowering <b>plants</b> <b>is</b> the natural vegetation. Sixty-two species of mammals and more than 112species of birds use Forest Park. A small population of coastal cutthroat trout resides in the stream, which in 2005 was the only major water body in Portland that met state standards for bacteria, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Climatic and osmotic {{pressure}} places physiological constraints on organisms, {{especially those that}} fly and respire at high altitudes, or dive to deep ocean depths. These constraints influence vertical limits of ecosystems in the biosphere, as organisms are physiologically sensitive and adapted to atmospheric and osmotic water pressure differences. For example, oxygen levels decrease with decreasing pressure and are a limiting factor for life at higher altitudes. Water transportation by <b>plants</b> <b>is</b> another important ecophysiological process affected by {{osmotic pressure}} gradients. Water pressure {{in the depths of}} oceans requires that organisms adapt to these conditions. For example, diving animals such as whales, dolphins, and seals are specially adapted to deal with changes in sound due to water pressure differences. Differences between hagfish species provide another example of adaptation to deep-sea pressure through specialized protein adaptations.|$|E

5|$|Drosera anglica {{grows in}} open, non-forested habitat with wet, often calcium-rich soils. These include bogs, marl fens, quaking bogs, cobble shores, and other {{calcareous}} habitats. This tolerance of calcium is relatively {{rare in the}} rest of the genus. D. anglica is often associated with various sphagnum mosses, and many times grows in a soil substrate that is entirely composed of living, dead, or decomposed sphagnum. The sphagnum wicks moisture to the surface while simultaneously acidifying it. What soil nutrients are not seeped away by the constant moisture are often used up by the sphagnum or made unavailable by the low soil pH. Since nutrient availability is low, competition from other <b>plants</b> <b>is</b> diminished, allowing the carnivorous English sundew to flourish.|$|E
5|$|Green {{is common}} in nature, as many plants are green because of a complex {{chemical}} known as chlorophyll, which is involved in photosynthesis. Chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by <b>plants</b> <b>is</b> enriched in green. Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis. Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using bacteriorhodopsin. The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria.|$|E
5|$|Historically, insects {{have been}} the most {{significant}} herbivores, and the evolution of land <b>plants</b> <b>is</b> closely associated with the evolution of insects. While most plant defenses are directed against insects, other defenses have evolved that are aimed at vertebrate herbivores, such as birds and mammals. The study of plant defenses against herbivory is important, not only from an evolutionary view point, but also in the direct impact that these defenses have on agriculture, including human and livestock food sources; as beneficial 'biological control agents' in biological pest control programs; {{as well as in the}} search for plants of medical importance.|$|E
