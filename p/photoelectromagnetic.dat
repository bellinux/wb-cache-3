50|$|Detectors used in LWR {{are usually}} {{based on a}} {{semiconductor}} photodetector array, which is typically cryogenically or thermal-electric cooled. Sometimes avalanche photodiodes (APD), photoconductivity, <b>photoelectromagnetic,</b> or photodiffusion devices are used even without cooling. Some devices detect only the main beam of foreign lasers while others detect even scattered rays.|$|E
50|$|HgCdTe {{can be used}} as a {{heterodyne}} detector, {{in which}} the interference between a local source and returned laser light is detected. In this case it can detect sources such as CO2 lasers. In heterodyne detection mode HgCdTe can be uncooled, although greater sensitivity is achieved by cooling. Photodiodes, photoconductors or <b>photoelectromagnetic</b> (PEM) modes can be used. A bandwidth well in excess of 1 GHz can be achieved with photodiode detectors.|$|E
40|$|The <b>photoelectromagnetic</b> {{investigations}} of graphene has been performed using noncontact technique. The dependence of <b>photoelectromagnetic</b> response on magnetic field induction, illumination intensity for differ-ent photon energies, {{and frequency of}} illumination chopping is presented. We anticipate our paper to be {{a starting point for}} {{investigations of}} carrier diffusion length in this material. Such investigations should be essential for development of graphene electronic and optoelectronic devices...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1963 This thesis {{presents}} a limited {{investigation of the}} effects of various etches on the surface properties of silicon. Surface recombination velocities of silicon under different etching treatments are compared by using the <b>photoelectromagnetic</b> effect. A measure of the minority carriers lifetime by the photoconductive decay method provides another means of comparing various surface treatments and ambient atmospheres. CP- 4 etch yields the smallest surface recombination velocity in silicon; while sodium dichromate solution has the pronounced effect of reducing the minority carrier lifetimes in silicon. Ambient atmospheres have no obvious influence on the surface recombination velocity of silicon...|$|E
40|$|Conceiving {{detectors}} and/or cameras, {{which can}} monitor the {{spatial and temporal}} beam distribution of very short and powerful CO 2 laser pulses {{is an important issue}} in the mid-IR region. A theoretical and experimental feasibility study was performed on novel detectors based on electron temperature gradients in resonant plasmas in GaAs based devices. Close to the plasma resonance, free carrier absorption can be sufficiently large leading to very strong electron temperature gradients, and hence substantial induced currents or voltages depending on the terminating resistor value. We measured responsivities of our novel and cheap detectors, which are equal to these of existing commercial detectors. From the large variety of detector principles (pyroelectric, photoconductive, <b>photoelectromagnetic)</b> that do exist only the photon drag effect can be used to detect ultrafast (deep sub-ns) mid-IR laser pulses having large optical power densities (> 1 MWcm- 2). The photon drag effect has a very low responsivity per unit length due th...|$|E
40|$|The <b>photoelectromagnetic</b> (PEM) {{effect was}} used to perform {{experiments}} on photocarriers' transport properties in GaAs substrates and epitaxial layers. For the undoped semi-insulating substrate, the carriers' mobility μ at T = 77 K was measured by PEM effect method, giving a value of μ = 40, 000 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1. It {{was found that the}} carriers' diffusion length is L D = 0. 27 μm at T = 300 K and L D = 0. 44 μm at T = 77 K. For the 3. 4 μm thick epitaxial layer grown by metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD), the carriers' diffusion length was measured to be L D = 2. 6 μm at T = 300 K, L D = 3. 1 μm at T = 77 K and L D ≈ 3. 5 μm at T = 5 K. A photocurrent (PC) spectroscopy study of In xGa 1 -xAs/GaAs quantum wells on Cr-doped and undoped substrates has been performed. Several well-resolved structures related to inter-subband transitions are observed in the photoconductivity spectra for both T = 300 K and T = 77 K, and they are in good agreement with calculation taking into account the strain-induced splitting of the bands. Both Cr-doped and undoped substrates have been found to influence the results, as shown by optical quenching techniques...|$|E
