40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} work, zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films are {{deposited}} by the ultrasonic spray method. In order {{to study the}} influence {{of the nature of the}} precursor solution, zinc acetate and zinc nitrate salts dissolved in methanol are used respectively to prepare two non-aqueous starting solutions. The influence of substrate temperature on the structural growth kinetics and optical properties of ZnO films is also investigated. For this purpose, the substrate temperature is varied in the range of 250 – 400 C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals that at low temperature the films that are grown contain nanocrystallites with a <b>privileged</b> <b>orientation</b> depending on the nature of the starting precursor; these privileged orientations correspond to the plane (100) for the films deposited with zinc acetate and (002) for films prepared with zinc nitrate precursor. However, with increasing deposition temperature, the <b>privileged</b> <b>orientation</b> disappears. The growth kinetics is closely related to the substrate temperature and to the nature of the starting solution. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations suggest that the liquid droplets react once they reach the substrate surface when zinc acetate precursor is used. However, in the case of zinc nitrate solution, the droplets spread first on the substrate surface followed by the subsequent surface reaction. This difference is explained in terms of the dis-sociation enthalpy of both solutions...|$|E

Flow direction is inferred from the plane determined by Kmax/Kint axes of the anisotropy ellipsoid. This plane reflects the characteristics (orientation and tilting) of the sediment fabric. Usually, solely the Kmax that parallels sand grains long axis is used to retrieve the sediment fabric and by then, the flow direction (Winkler et al. 1997; Wassmer et al. 2010; Wassmer and Gomez 2011).|$|E
40|$|If {{you wanted}} to take a good picture of an object, which {{orientation}} (i. e., viewpoint) would you choose? A typi-cal answer is the three-quarter view, the view in which an object’s orientation is oblique between front and side. Pictures of products in advertisements and catalogues also tend to favor the three-quarter view. In fact, a high subjective “goodness ” for a three-quarter view has been empirically documented; when people are asked to take the best pictures of objects, they choose the three-quarter view for most objects (Blanz, Tarr, & Bülthoff, 1999; Palmer, Rosch, & Chase, 1981; see also Verfaillie & Boutsen, 1995). These studies have also suggested that each familiar object has a <b>privileged</b> <b>orientation,</b> referred to as the canonical view, which yields substantial advantages for a variety of cognitive tasks, including object recognition...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{deformation}} behaviour and {{fracture of}} an open-cell nickel foam were analysed using X-ray microtomography at the ESRF, Grenoble, France. In situ tensile and compression tests were performed at {{a resolution of}} 2 and 10 b. mum. The initial morphology of the foam was studied using 3 D image analysis. Parameters such as the cell volume and strut length distributions, number of faces per cell, number of nodes per face and {{the shape of the}} most representative cells were determined. The cells are shown to be non-spherical due to the initial geometrical anisotropy of the polyurethane foam template and to the load applied to the nickel foam during processing. This geometrical anisotropy is shown {{to be related to the}} observed anisotropy of the elastic properties of the material using a simple beam model. In tension, bending, stretching and alignment of struts are observed. A tensile test in the longitudinal direction is shown to reinforce the <b>privileged</b> <b>orientations</b> of the cells. In contrast, a tensile test in the transverse direction leads to a more isotropic distribution of the cells. These features are illustrated by pole figures of the three axes of equivalent ellipsoids for all cells at different strain levels. Compression tests are associated with strain localization phenomena due to the buckling of struts in a weaker region of the foam. Finally, study of open-cell nickel foam fracture shows that cracks initiate at nodes during tensile tests and that the damaged zone is about five cells wide. Free edge effects on crack initiation are also evidenced...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOrientation {{perception}} {{is known to}} be anisotropic, with cardinal axes (i. e., horizontal and vertical) being <b>privileged.</b> Indeed, <b>orientation</b> sensitivity is greater near the cardinals, and small deviations from cardinal axes may be illusorily perceived in an exaggerated manner. Here, we quantified this illusory deviation from the cardinals at various visibility levels, by having participants reproduce the orientation of oriented Gabor stimuli whose visibility was manipulated by duration and masking. We found, first, that participants could reproduce quite accurately the orientation of very brief stimuli presented at lowest visibility levels. Second, the magnitude of the deviation followed a non-monotonic pattern, being maximal for stimuli of intermediate visibility, and lower for both the lowest and highest visibility levels. Thus, orientation processing at lowest visibility levels is noisier but paradoxically more faithful to the physical input. This counterintuitive result suggests that categorical processing of sensory information depends on perceptual awareness...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: Extracting {{geometrical}} {{information from}} large 2 D or 3 D biomedical images {{is important to}} better understand fundamental phenomena such as morphogenesis. We {{address the problem of}} automatically analyzing spatial organization of cells or nuclei in 2 D or 3 D images of tissues. This problem is challenging due to the usually low quality of microscopy images as well as their typically large sizes. Results: The structure tensor is a simple and robust descriptor that was developed to analyze textures orientation. Contrarily to segmentation methods which rely on an object based modelling of images, the structure tensor views the sample at a macroscopic scale, like a continuum. We propose an original theoretical analysis of this tool and show that it allows quantifying two important features of nuclei in tissues: their <b>privileged</b> <b>orientation</b> as well as the ratio between the length of their main axes. A quantitative evaluation of the method is provided for synthetic and real 2 D and 3 D images. As an application, we analyze the nuclei orientation and anisotropy on multicellular tumor spheroids cryosections. This analysis reveals that cells are elongated in a privileged direction that is parallel to the boundary of the spheroid. Availability: Source codes are available at [URL]...|$|E
40|$|AbstractStructural {{properties}} of CuIn(1 −x) AlxS 2 layers obtained by spray pyrolysis on various substrates were studied using X Ray Diffraction, Atomic Force Microscopy and Scanning electron microscopy. The concentration of Al in the spray solution, {{represented by the}} ratio z (z=[Al 3 +]/[In 3 +]), was varied from 0 to 3. 2 %. The different substrates are: glass, ZnO/glass, SnO 2 /glass, ZnO/SnO 2 /glass and In 2 S 3 /Glass. All the layers were deposited by spray. The ZnO used in the substrates was doped with indium. The concentration of indium in the ZnO sprayed solution is [In]/[Zn]= 3 %. The X-ray diffraction spectra revealed that, different values of the ratio z, the CuIn(1 −x) AlxS 2 thin films were well crystallized in the tetragonal structure of the CuInS 2 material with the <b>privileged</b> <b>orientation</b> (112) whatever the substrate. The surface topography of the CuIn(1 −x) AlxS 2 thin films, deduced from the Atomic Force Microscopy, proved that the grain size {{in the top of}} the layers depends both on the z value and on the substrate. The Auger analysis has been done in order to get information on the surface layer composition, the measurement show that the surface chemical composition where improved by annealing. In this work the performances of the solar cell CuIn(1 −x) AlxS 2 (p) /CuInS 2 (p) /In 2 S 3 (n) /ZnO, realized with optimized value of Al concentration, is also presented...|$|E
40|$|Most {{intracranial}} aneurysms morphologic studies {{focused on}} characterization of size, location, aspect ratio, {{relationship to the}} surrounding vasculature and hemodynamics. However, the spatial orientation {{with respect to the}} gravity direction has not been taken into account although it could trigger various hemodynamic conditions. The present work addresses this possibility. It was divided in two parts: 1) the orientations of 18, 3 D time-of-flight MRI (3 D TOF MRI), scans of saccular aneurysms were analyzed. This investigation suggested that there was no <b>privileged</b> <b>orientation</b> for cerebral aneurysms. The aneurysms were oriented in the brain as follows: 9 – down, 9 – up; 11 – right, 7 – left; 6 – front, 12 – back. 2) Based on these results, subsidiary in vitro experiments were performed, analyzing the behavior of red blood cells (RBCs) within a silicone model of aneurysm before and after flow diverter stent (FDS) deployment in the parent vessel. These experiments used a test bench that reproduces physiological pulsatile flow conditions for two orientations: an aneurysm sack pointing either up (opposite to gravitational force) and down (along the gravitational force). The results showed that the orientation of an aneurysm significantly affects the intra-aneurysmal RBCs behavior after stenting, and therefore that gravity can affect the intra-aneurysm behavior of RBCs. This suggests that the patient׳s aneurysm orientation could impact the outcome of the FDS treatment. The implementation of this effect in patient-specific numerical and preoperative decision support techniques could contribute to better understand the intrasaccular biological and hemodynamic events induced by FDS.

40|$|Synthetic {{peptides}} reproducing the proteolytic processing site of pro-ocytocin {{were studied}} by different spectroscopic techniques, including circular dichroism, Fourier transform infrared absorption, and mono and bidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance, {{in order to}} ascertain the possible role of three-dimensional structure in the recognition process by maturation enzymes. Experimental results were compared with energy minimization calculations and suggest that: (i) the region situated on the N-terminus of the Lys-Arg doublet may form a beta-turn; (ii) the sequential organization of the residues participating in the beta-turn determines the <b>privileged</b> relative <b>orientation</b> of the basic amino acid sidechains and the subtype of turn; and (iii) the peptide segment situated on the C-terminal side of the dibasic doublet may assume a helix arrangement. These findings, {{in spite of the}} limitations connected to the flexibility of linear peptides, seem to substantiate the hypothesis that structural motifs around the cleavage site could be important for recognition and processing. however, a straightforward correlation between details of the secondary structure and the in vitro reactivity toward a putative convertase is not yet possible...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} thermal (tSZ) and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect {{associated}} with superclusters of galaxies using the MareNostrum (MNU) universe smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation. In particular, we consider superclusters with characteristics (total mass, overdensity and number density of cluster members) {{similar to those}} of the Corona Borealis Supercluster (CrB-SC). This paper has been motivated by the detection at 33 GHz of a strong temperature decrement in the cosmic microwave background towards the core of this supercluster (Genova-Santos et al.). Multifrequency observations with Very Small Array (VSA) and Millimetre & Infrared Testa Grigia Observatory (MITO) suggest the existence of a tSZ effect component in the spectrum of this cold spot, with a Comptonization parameter value of y = 7. 8 + 4. 4 (- 5. 3) x 10 - 6 (Battistelli et al.), which would account for roughly 25 per cent of the total observed decrement. From the SPH simulation, we identify nine (50 h- 1 Mpc) 3 regions containing superclusters similar to CrB-SC, obtain the associated SZ maps and calculate the probability of finding such SZ signals arising from hot gas within the supercluster. Our results show that the warm/hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) lying in the intercluster regions within the supercluster produces a tSZ effect much smaller than the observed value by MITO/VSA. Neither can, summing the contribution of small clusters and galaxy groups (M < 5 x 1013 h- 1 M(circle dot)) in the region, explain the amplitude of the SZ signal. Our synthetic maps show peak y-values significantly below the observations. Less than 0. 3 per cent are compatible at the lower end of the 1 Sigma level, even when considering <b>privileged</b> <b>orientations</b> in which the filamentary structures are aligned along the line of sight (LOS). When we take into account the actual posterior distribution from the observations, the probability that WHIM can cause a tSZ signal like the one observed in the CrB-SC is < 1 per cent, rising up to a 3. 2 per cent when the contribution of small clusters and galaxy groups is included. If the simulations provide a suitable description of the gas physics, then we must conclude that the tSZ component of the CrB spot most probably arises from an unknown galaxy cluster along the LOS. On the other hand, the simulations also show that the kSZ signal associated with the supercluster cannot provide an explanation for the remaining 75 per cent of the observed cold spot in CrB...|$|R
40|$|By {{studying}} pearlitic steels using a scanning {{electron microscope}} it can be observed that pearlite is a two-phase material with cementite lamellae embedded in a matrix of ferrite. The cementite is commonly described as being stiff and brittle {{in comparison to the}} ferrite which is considered to have a soft and ductile mechanical behavior. The observed macroscopic mechanical behavior of a pearlitic steel {{is a result of the}} individual behavior of these two constituents as well as of how they interact. It can also be noted that the cementite lamellae appear in so called colonies within which the cementite lamellae have a <b>privileged</b> <b>orientation.</b> Based on this observation it is natural to assume that the average stress-strain behavior of such a colony is anisotropic. Despite this, the macroscopic behavior of a pearlitic steel (virgin material) is considered to be isotropic which is explained by the fact that the individual orientations of these colonies are randomly distributed such that the local anisotropy is canceled out on average. It is well known, however, that subjecting a pearlitic steel to severe loads will cause the cementite lamellae to align. An example of such type of loading is the contact between a railway wheel and the rail where a large contact force is distributed over a small area. The cyclic loading causes an increasing alignment of the lamellae which results in an evolution of macroscopic anisotropy which in turn is known to also play an important role for other phenomena such as crack initiation and propagation. In this thesis the feasibility of using the concept of MultiScale Modeling (MSM) to model the mechanical behavior of a pearlitic steel is investigated. The proposed model explicitly includes the colonies as well as the cementite lamellae and the ferrite matrix. The drawback of MSM is its increased computational cost compared to traditional macroscopic constitutive modeling. However, a number of benefits of MSM are worth highlighting. To begin with, it offers a possibility to predict the anisotropic mechanisms discussed above (both the initial local subscale anisotropy and the evolving macroscopic anisotropy). It can also help to increase the understanding of the mechanical behavior of the material. Additionally, once the model is calibrated it can be used for virtual material testing in which the subscale features of the material are modified and the resulting impact on the mechanical behavior of the material can be studied. In addition to the modeling efforts presented in this thesis experimental data from tensile testing, micropillar testing and in-situ SEM images (analyzed using digital image correlation) is used to further increase the knowledge about the observed mechanical behavior of pearlite...|$|E
40|$|Bioactivation of pro-proteins by limited {{proteolysis}} is {{a general}} mechanism in the biosynthesis of hormones, receptors and viral protein precursors. This proceeds by cleavage of peptide bonds {{at the level of}} single or pairs of basic residues in the proforms. Examination of a number of cleavage loci in various precursors failed to reveal any consensus primary sequence around the dibasic cleavage sites. Thus it has been proposed, on the basis of secondary structure predictions [Rholam, M., Nicolas, P. and Cohen, P. (1986) FEBS Lett., 207, 1 - 6], that those basic residues which operate as signal loci for the proteolytic enzyme machinery are situated in, or next to, privileged precursor regions most often constituted by flexible and exposed motifs, e. g. beta-turns and/or loops. Peptides reproducing the N-terminal processing domain of the hormone precursor, pro-ocytocin-neurophysin, were examined by a combination of spectroscopical techniques including circular dichroism, infrared Fourier transform and one- and two-dimensional proton NMR. The results indicate that: (i) the region situated on the N terminus of the Lys-Arg doublet is organized as a beta-turn in solution; (ii) the sequential organization of the residues participating in the beta-turn determines the <b>privileged</b> relative <b>orientation</b> of the basic amino acid side chains and the subtype of turn; (iii) the peptide segment situated on the C-terminal side of the dibasic, corresponding to the N-terminal octapeptide of neurophysin, is organized as an alpha-helix.

30|$|Anisotropy of inelastic behaviors, or {{in a more}} broad sense, the {{dependence}} of inelastic behaviors {{on the type of}} loading and direction is common for many high-temperature materials (Naumenko and Altenbach 2016). Important features of plastic anisotropy and asymmetry can be related to different length scales, like grain/subgrain scale, phase/lamellar scale, crystal lattice scale, dislocations and atomic scales, etc. <b>Privileged</b> crystallographic <b>orientation</b> or texture development can be associated with grain scale. Similarly many other origins of the anisotropy like defects inclusions-cavities in metals and multiphase alloys, directional distribution of a particular phase, anisotropy of individual grains, etc., can be related to different scale dependent phenomena. In order to understand different macroscopic behaviors including the plastic anisotropy and asymmetry in Ti-Al alloys, it is necessary to understand their origins at the lower length scales. Regular misfit dislocations along the lamellar interfaces, formation of faulted dipoles of superdislocations, changes in deformation modes due to the appearance of some superstructures, domination of climb at high temperature, etc., for the Al-rich TiAl family are few of them at the smaller scales. Various macroscopic behaviors of this family, like anomalous yielding and hardening, recovery, increasing brittleness with the increase of Al-content, etc. are also deserved to be investigated in order to understand different inelastic phenomena. This knowledge is in turn instrumental {{to the understanding of the}} mechanisms responsible for the anomalous behavior, plastic anisotropy and tension compression asymmetry, etc. (Gregori and Veyssiere 2000). In general, it is believed that the plastic behaviors in Al-rich TiAl alloys depend on the formation of superstructural phases and the activated slip systems varied (Nakano et al. 1999).|$|R

The multi/plural turn parallels postcolonial theory in that they both support hybridity and fluidity while problematizing the essentialist under-standing of language and identity. However, postcolonial theory, which has been influenced by poststructuralism, met criticisms in the 1990 s in cultural studies. The notion of hybridity has been especially criticized for its <b>privileged</b> status, individual <b>orientation,</b> and disparity between theory and practice. Furthermore, the conceptual features of the multi/plural turn overlap with neo-liberalism and neoliberal multiculturalism, which uncritically support diversity, plurality, flexibility, individualism, and cosmopolitanism, while perpetuating color-blindness and racism. The multi/plural turn also neglects the ways in which neoliberal competition and the dominance of English affect scholars. This article examines the multi/plural trend by drawing on some critiques of postcolonial theory and neoliberal ideologies and proposes an increased atten-tion to power and inequalities as well as collective efforts to resist the neoliberal academic culture underlying the multi/plural turn...|$|R
40|$|Catharine MacKinnon's {{work has}} been a shaping force in the {{development}} of feminist legal theory {{as well as on the}} course of legal reform. Although few feminist scholars accept her views on gender and sexuality in their entirety, her preeminent contribution to feminist legal theory is generally acknowledged. MacKinnon's most signal legal reform success has been in identifying sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination prohibited by federal employment law. More recently, attended by greater controversy and less material success, she has been active in the feminist antipornography campaign. This chapter has two objectives. The first is simply the journeywoman task of understanding MacKinnon's theory of gender and especially the methodology she employs. The second objective is to defend an aspect of MacKinnon's methodology that has of late come under political and philosophical attack. She has been accused of gender essentialism, a vice that is variously defined but is most commonly understood to mean treating the concept of gender as a transcultural and transhistorical universal. The price of gender essentialism, according to its critics, is the imposition of false uniformity on the disparate experience of women of different classes, races, ethnicities, and sexual <b>orientations.</b> <b>Privileged</b> white intellectuals read their own experience as that of women as such. In doing so we falsify the experience of those whom we call sisters but whose voices we ignore. In my view, these deplorable consequences do not necessarily overtake the theorist who seeks to generalize about gender. The impulse that animates MacKinnon's work, the desire to formulate a theory that speaks from and to the experience of all women, should not be easily relinquished. Generalizing about gender, at least in the modest form in which it is done by this bold theorist, need not be philosophically or politically pernicious...|$|R
