[...] After hours of waiting, a representative of ABC arrived and relocated each of the 160 frustrated applicants to other scheduled screening.

[...] Corrales later clarified in the Wildcard Round that she said such a statement because of the low turnout in the Davao auditions and the even lower Gold Pass output.

It's the same for videogames. While Itchy and Scratchy appeared in a hilarious cameo on the Super NES and Mega Drive/Genesis game Bart's Nightmare, here they duke it out in an interminable, multistage whackfest."

2500|$|The CMST {{researchers}} believe that the most likely explanation of the hydroacoustic data is that {{they come from the}} same event, but unrelated to Flight 370. They note that [...] "the characteristics of the [...] are not unusual, it is only their arrival time and to some extent the direction from which they came that make them of interest". If the data relates to the same event, related to Flight 370, but the arc derived from analysis of the aircraft's satellite transmission is incorrect, then the most likely <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> the aircraft would be along a line from HA01 at a bearing of 301.6° until that line reaches the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge (approximately 2.3°S, 73.7°E). In the latter possibility, if the acoustic recordings are from the impact of the aircraft with the ocean, they likely came from a location where water is less than 2,000m deep and the seabed slopes downwards towards the east or southeast; if they came from debris imploding at depth, the source location along this line is much less certain. The lead CMST researcher believed the chance the acoustic event was related to Flight 370 to be very slim, perhaps as low as 10%. The audio recording of the suspect detection was publicly released on 4 June 2014; the ATSB had first referenced these signals in a document posted on its website on 26 May.|$|E

60|$|The {{varieties}} of the banana are infinite in number, and, {{as in most}} other plants of ancient cultivation, they shade off into one another by infinitesimal gradations. Two principal sorts, however, are commonly recognised--the true banana of commerce, and the common plantain. The banana proper is eaten raw, as a fruit, and is allowed accordingly to ripen thoroughly before being picked for market; the plantain, which is the true food-stuff of all the equatorial region in both hemispheres, is gathered green and roasted as a vegetable, or, to use the more expressive West Indian negro phrase, as a bread-kind. Millions of human beings in Asia, Africa, America, and the islands of the Pacific Ocean live almost entirely on the mild and succulent but tasteless plantain. Some people like the fruit; to me personally it is more suggestive of a very flavourless over-ripe pear than of anything else in heaven or earth or the waters that are under the earth--the latter being the most probable <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> it, as its taste and substance are decidedly watery. Baked dry in the green state 'it resembles roasted chestnuts,' or rather baked parsnip; pulped and boiled with water it makes 'a very agreeable sweet soup,' almost as nice as peasoup with brown sugar in it; and cut into slices, sweetened, and fried, it forms 'an excellent substitute for fruit pudding,' having a flavour much like that of potatoes à la maítre d'hótel served up in treacle.|$|E
