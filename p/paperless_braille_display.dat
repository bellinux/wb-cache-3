50|$|NFB has {{partnered with}} Kurzweil Educational Systems, a company founded by noted {{inventor}} and futurist Ray Kurzweil, {{to develop a}} completely portable reading machine: the Kurzweil-National Federation of the Blind Reader. A digital camera takes {{a picture of the}} printed material to be read, and an attached personal digital assistant (PDA) reads the text aloud. The text is also stored as a text file, which can be saved and moved to a computer or portable notetaker {{so that it can be}} sent to a Braille embosser (sometimes called a Braille printer) or read on a <b>paperless</b> <b>Braille</b> <b>display.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a computer interface for visually handicapped people, which has an ASCII text to speech converter, a <b>paperless</b> <b>braille</b> <b>display</b> and an IBM/compatible PC. The system is simple to use and cost effective, as it has minimum hard and software, just enough to meet the requirements. Since it is built around a PC, many of its features can be made available to the visually handicapped. It can be used to teach braille codes, programming, word processing, etc...|$|E

5000|$|A BrailleNote is a {{computer}} made by HumanWare for persons with visual impairments. It has either a braille keyboard or a Qwerty Keyboard, a speech synthesizer, and a 32- or 18-column refreshable <b>Braille</b> <b>display,</b> depending on model. The [...] "VoiceNote" [...] is the same device without a <b>braille</b> <b>display.</b> The BrailleNote GPS is an 18 or 32 cell BrailleNote with an External GPS module. BrailleNote GPS.|$|R
50|$|A refreshable <b>braille</b> <b>display</b> or <b>braille</b> {{terminal}} is an electro-mechanical {{device for}} <b>displaying</b> <b>braille</b> characters, usually {{by means of}} round-tipped pins raised through holes in a flat surface. Blind computer users who cannot use a computer monitor {{can use it to}} read text output. Speech synthesizers are also commonly used for the same task, and a blind user may switch between the two systems or use {{both at the same time}} depending on circumstances. Deafblind computer users may also use refreshable <b>braille</b> <b>displays.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A rotating-wheel <b>Braille</b> <b>display</b> was {{developed}} in 2000 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and another at the Leuven University in Belgium. Both wheels {{are still in the}} process of commercialization. In these units, braille dots are put on the edge of a spinning wheel, which allows the user to read continuously with a stationary finger while the wheel spins at a selected speed. The braille dots are set in a simple scanning-style fashion as the dots on the wheel spin past a stationary actuator that sets the braille characters. As a result, manufacturing complexity is greatly reduced and rotating-wheel <b>braille</b> <b>displays,</b> when in actual production, should be less expensive than traditional <b>braille</b> <b>displays.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>Braille</b> <b>Displays</b> for iOS {{program was}} {{announced}} by Apple {{coinciding with the}} release of the iPhone 3GS, iPad and iPod Touch (3rd Generation). This program added support for more than 50 Bluetooth wireless <b>braille</b> <b>displays</b> that work with iOS out of the box. The user only needs to pair the keyboard to the device to start using it to navigate the iOS device with VoiceOver without any additional software. iOS supports braille tables for more than 25 languages.|$|R
50|$|The {{base of a}} refreshable <b>braille</b> <b>display</b> often {{integrates}} a pure braille keyboard. There, {{the input}} is performed by two sets of four keys on each side, while output is via a refreshable <b>braille</b> <b>display</b> consisting of a row of electro-mechanical character cells, each of which can raise or lower a combination of eight round-tipped pins. Other variants exist that use a conventional QWERTY keyboard for input and braille pins for output, as well as input-only and output-only devices.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the optimum}} design and dynamic {{analysis}} of {{a new type of}} piezoelectric <b>Braille</b> <b>display</b> cell are studied by computer aided engineering software. At first, the design parameters of piezoelectric actuator are analyzed by finite element method to determine the position of fixed end and minimum voltage to actuate 0. 7 mm displacement and 15 g output force. Then, the optimum design is performed according to the electric displacement 0. 7 mm, output force 15 g, actuator length, position of fixed end and minimum voltage. Finally, <b>Braille</b> <b>display</b> cell is analyzed by dynamic simulation software. It shows that actuators take 0. 0002 sec to upward achieve 0. 7 mm displacement. The result of optimum design is reasonable in this paper which can be the reference for related research...|$|R
