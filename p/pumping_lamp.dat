Still, they show disadvantages by means of thermo mechanics and design complexity. Where <b>lamp</b> <b>pumped</b> rod systems got two <b>pump</b> <b>lamps</b> per high power head, the same rod has to be pumped using up to 100 high power diode lasers instead. All diode lasers have to to be cooled and electrically connected, while each diode laser can be observed as a single resistance in the flow system and the pressure drop item is even increasing in scaling power by using several laser heads in series.

Once the vapor pressure of P4 is low enough either filler gas is admitted to the bulb prior to sealing off or, if a vacuum atmosphere is desired the bulb is sealed off at that point. The high decomposition temperature of P3N5 allows sealing machines to run faster and hotter than was possible using red phosphorus.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in eye-safe, short wavelength solid-state lasers offer real {{potential for the}} development of compact, reliable, light-weight, efficient coherent lidar. Laser diode pumping of these devices has been demonstrated, thereby eliminating the need for flash <b>lamp</b> <b>pumping,</b> which has been a major drawback to the use of these lasers in space based applications. Also these lasers now have the frequency stability required to make them useful in coherent lidar, which offers all of the advantages of non-coherent lidar, but with the additional advantage that direct determination of target velocity is possible by measurement of the Doppler shift. By combining the Doppler velocity measurement capability with the inherent high angular resolution and range accuracy of lidar it is possible to construct Doppler images of targets for target motion assessment.

40|$|There {{has been}} much recent {{interest}} {{in the production of}} high‐peak power laser pulses by regeneration switching. Organic dyes have been used as saturable filters for both the ruby (cyanine dyes) and neodymium (a polymethine dye) to produce single high‐power spikes. The cyanine dye, in suitable concentration and path length, {{can also be used to}} produce a long train of slightly enhanced (gain about 10) regular Q‐switched spikes from the ruby laser, but the neodymium laser can apparently only be operated in the single‐pike mode. This paper reports the discovery of saturable filter action in a common dye, rose bengal, a derivative of fluorescein, which permits the production of an extremely regular sequence of enhanced spikes from the neodymium laser. Unlike the previous dyes, the transition corresponding to the saturable absorption occurs between two excited states, not between the ground state and an excited state.

TEM_ 0 _ 0 beam diameter of more than 7 mm were possible. With this resonator concept the beam quality of the fundamental mode operation of better than M" 2 < 1. 2 with different SBS materials, different pump geometries, different rod sizes and average output powers could be realized. Both, Nd:YAG and Nd:YALO as active material allowed average output powers between 45 and 47 W. By using the phase conjugating SBS mirrors {{it was possible to}} realize a Nd:YALO laser with 50 W average output power and an efficiency of 1. 6 %. 100 W average output power could be realized with a beam quality of better than M" 2 = 3. 7. Efficiencies of the flash <b>lamp</b> <b>pumped</b> laser were in all cases better than the published values. By choosing a special wave guide geometry in optical fibers a new phase conjugating mirror could be realized. Thus, a very low threshold in combination with a high fidelity of the phase conjugation and very high reflectivities over a large dynamic range could be realized. This is the precondition for using this type of SBS mirrors in laser resonators.
