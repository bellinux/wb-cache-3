25|$|The butler’s mosaic {{dating from}} the middle of the 3rd century CE {{features}} a drinking scene. Two characters are serving two others, who are much smaller, from amphoras on their shoulders. The two amphoras bear the letters PIE (“Drink!” in Ancient Greek) and ZHCHC (“You will live” in Ancient Greek). The amphora bearers are flanked by another two characters, one of whom is carrying another amphora, the other of whom is carrying a branch of laurel and a basket of roses. This depiction is a greeting to all guests and a promise of hospitality. The same is true of another mosaic held at the museum which bears the phrase Omnia tibi felicia (May everything <b>please</b> <b>you).</b>|$|E

500|$|LaVey {{explains}} {{his reasons for}} writing The Satanic Bible in a short preface. He speaks skeptically about volumes written by other authors {{on the subject of}} magic, dismissing them as [...] "nothing more than sanctimonious fraud" [...] and [...] "volumes of hoary misinformation and false prophecy". He complains that other authors do no more than confuse the subject. He mocks those who spend large amounts of money on attempts to follow rituals and learn about the magic shared in other occult books. He also notes that many of the existing writings on Satanic magic and ideology were created by [...] "right-hand path" [...] authors. He tells that The Satanic Bible contains both truth and fantasy, and declares, [...] "What you see may not always <b>please</b> <b>you,</b> but you will see!" ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings to the [...] "sexual teasing" [...] lyrics, which are {{addressed}} to the men looking at her: [...] "I can be a tease, but I really wanna <b>please</b> <b>you</b> [...] Oohhh you watchin me shake it, [...] Ya can't take it, it’s blazin ...". The chorus lines; [...] "Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight" [...] are sung in a very quick and breathless manner by Beyoncé. Bret McCabe noted that her pace could be {{compared to that of}} American singer Donna Summer. Slim Thug appears again after the second verse to perform another different verse rap: [...] "I’m checking on you boo, do what’chu do / And while you dance I’ma glance at this beautiful view / I’m keep my hands in my pants, I need to glue ’em with glue ...". Before the song ends, Beyoncé repeats the chorus lines four times as additional vocals of hers are played in the background.|$|E
500|$|Increasing {{territorial}} {{conflict between}} the Sioux and the Ojibwe on the western frontier, particularly along the Mississippi river, led the U.S. government to attempt to mediate the conflicts. President Andrew Jackson's policy toward the tribes ultimately was to either pacify them sufficiently to allow westward expansion of American settlers, or else remove the tribes from {{the areas in which}} they prevented settlement. The First Treaty of Prairie du Chien (1825), among its provisions established southern Minnesota as well as much of modern North and South Dakota as the homeland of the Dakota Sioux. The Ojibwe were given northern Minnesota and much of Wisconsin. The U.S. government, though, failed to enforce the treaty agreements leading to Little Crow's pronouncement to Indian agent Taliaferro in 1829: [...] "We made peace to <b>please</b> <b>you,</b> but if we are badly off we must blame you for causing us to give up so much of our lands to our enemies." ...|$|E
500|$|After Alexander's {{death in}} 323BC, Demosthenes again urged the Athenians to seek {{independence}} from Macedon in {{what became known}} as the Lamian War. However, Antipater, Alexander's successor, quelled all opposition and demanded that the Athenians turn over Demosthenes and Hypereides, among others. Following his request, the ecclesia adopted a decree condemning the most prominent anti-Macedonian agitators to death. Demosthenes escaped to a sanctuary on the island of Kalaureia (modern-day Poros), where he was later discovered by Archias, a confidant of Antipater. He committed suicide before his capture by taking poison out of a reed, pretending he wanted to write a letter to his family. When Demosthenes felt that the poison was working on his body, he said to Archias: [...] "Now, as soon as you <b>please</b> <b>you</b> may commence the part of Creon in the tragedy, and cast out this body of mine unburied. But, O gracious Neptune, I, for my part, while I am yet alive, arise up and depart out of this sacred place; though Antipater and the Macedonians have not left so much as the temple unpolluted." [...] After saying these words, he passed by the altar, fell down and died. Years after Demosthenes's suicide, the Athenians erected a statue to honour him and decreed that the state should provide meals to his descendants in the Prytaneum.|$|E

As Horthy stalled, the politicians gave in to his demands and granted him [...] "the general prerogatives of the King, {{with the exception of the}} right to name titles of nobility and of the patronage of the Church." [...] The prerogatives he was given included the power to appoint and dismiss prime ministers, to convene and dissolve parliament, and to command the armed forces.

2500|$|The film {{observes the}} Beatles (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr) from a [...] "fly on the wall" [...] perspective, without narration, scene titles, or {{interviews}} with the main subjects. The first portion of the film shows the band rehearsing on a sound stage at Twickenham Film Studios. The songs are works in progress, with discussions among the band members about ways to improve them. At one point, McCartney and Harrison have an uncomfortable exchange, with McCartney criticising a guitar riff played by Harrison on [...] "Two of Us". Harrison responds: [...] "I'll play whatever {{you want me to}} play, or I won't play at all if you don't want me to play. Whatever it is that will <b>please</b> <b>you,</b> I'll do it." [...] Also appearing are Mal Evans, providing the hammer blows on [...] "Maxwell's Silver Hammer", and Yoko Ono, dancing with Lennon.|$|E
2500|$|On Monday, 6 January 1969, {{during the}} Get Back {{sessions}} at Twickenham Film Studios, Harrison presented the song {{to the other}} Beatles, announcing that he had written it over the weekend. Like [...] "Let It Down", [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] and other compositions of his around this time, it was met with little enthusiasm from bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The band barely rehearsed [...] "Hear Me Lord" [...] that day, during which Harrison and McCartney engaged in an on-camera argument culminating in Harrison's resigned comment [...] "Whatever it is that will <b>please</b> <b>you,</b> I'll do it." [...] Even after the location had been moved to the Apple basement later that month and keyboard player Billy Preston brought in – two developments Harrison instigated {{in an attempt to}} improve the atmosphere – he would not play the song again at any Beatles session.|$|E

[...] Yum-Yum appears with Ko-Ko's other two wards, Peep-Bo and Pitti-Sing ("Comes a train of little ladies", [...] "Three little maids from school"). Pooh-Bah does not think that the girls have shown him enough respect ("So <b>please</b> <b>you,</b> sir"). Nanki-Poo arrives and informs Ko-Ko of his love for Yum-Yum. Ko-Ko sends him away, but Nanki-Poo manages to meet with his beloved and reveals his secret to Yum-Yum: he is the son and heir of the Mikado, but travels in disguise to avoid the amorous advances of Katisha, an elderly lady of his father's court. They lament that the law forbids them to flirt ("Were you not to Ko-Ko plighted").|$|E

2500|$|At Olivia's {{first meeting}} with [...] "Cesario" [...] (Viola) in I.V she asks her [...] "Are you a comedian?" [...] (an Elizabethan term for [...] "actor"). Viola's reply, [...] "I am not that I play", epitomising her {{adoption}} {{of the role of}} Cesario, is regarded as one of several references to theatricality and [...] "playing" [...] within the play. The plot against Malvolio revolves around these ideas, and Fabian remarks in Act III, Scene iv: [...] "If this were play'd upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction". In Act IV, Scene ii, Feste (The Fool) plays both parts in the [...] "play" [...] for Malvolio's benefit, alternating between adopting the voice of the local curate, Sir Topas, and his own voice. He finishes by likening himself to [...] "the old Vice" [...] of English Morality plays. Other influences of the English folk tradition can be seen in Feste's songs and dialogue, such as his final song in Act V. The last line of this song, [...] "And we'll strive to <b>please</b> <b>you</b> every day", is a direct echo of similar lines from several English folk plays.|$|E
2500|$|Chhattisgarh has a {{significant}} role in the life of lord Rama. Lord Rama along with his wife Sita and his younger brother Lakshaman had started his Vanvas (exile) in the Bastar region (more precisely Dandakaranya region) of Chhattisgarh. They lived more than 10 of their 14 years of Vanvas in different places of Chhattisgarh. One of the remarkable place is Shivrinarayan which is nearby Bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh. Shivrinarayan was named after an old lady Shabari. When Ram visited Shabari she said [...] "I do not have anything to offer other than my heart, but here are some berry fruits. May it <b>please</b> <b>you,</b> my Lord." [...] Saying so, Shabari offered the fruits she had meticulously collected to Rama. When Rama was tasting them, Lakshmana raised the concern that Shabari had already tasted them and therefore unworthy of eating. To this Rama said that of the many types of food he had tasted, [...] "nothing could equal these berry fruits, offered with such devotion. You taste them, then alone will you know. Whomsoever offers a fruit, leaf, flower or some water with love, I partake it with great joy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Woolf {{wrote about}} meeting Sackville-West in 1925: [...] "Vita shines in the grocer's shop in Sevenoaks...pink growing, grape clustered, pearl hung...There is her {{maturity}} and full-breastedness; her being so much full in sail {{on the high}} tides, where I am coasting down backwaters; her capacity I mean to take the floor in any company, to represent her country, to visit Chatsworth, to control silver, servants, chow dogs, her motherhood...her in short being (what I have never been) a real woman". [...] Sackville-West greatly admired Woolf's writings, declaring in a 1925 letter: [...] "My darling, last night I went to bed early and read Mrs. Dalloway-It was a very curious sensation: I thought {{you were in the}} room...I was very unhappy because I had a row with my mother and very happy because of you; so it felt like being two different people at the same time...I felt quite light, as though I was falling through my bed, like when one has a high fever. Today I am quite solid again and my boots are quite muddy. They weigh me down. Yet I am not solid as usual-not quite an oaf-because there is {{at the back of my}} mind all the time...a glow, a sort of nebula, which only when I examine it hardens into a shape; as soon as I think of something else it dissolves again, remaining there like the sun through a fog and I have to reach out again, to take it into my hands & feel its contours: then it hardens, [...] "Virginia is coming on Saturday!". Sackville-West considered Woolf to be the better writer, telling Woolf in one letter: [...] "I contrast my illiterate writing with your scholarly one, and I am ashamed". Though Woolf envied Sackville-West's ability to quickly turn out books compared to her laborious efforts to turn out a novel, she was inclined to agree with this assessment, writing in her diary that A Passenger to Tehran was written too much in haste as [...] "Vita's prose is too fluent". Before going on her second trip to Persia in 1927, a chastened Sackville-West, after receiving several letters from Woolf telling her not to churn out books, wrote to Woolf: [...] "I shall work so hard , partly to <b>please</b> <b>you</b> and partly to please myself...I treasure your sudden discourse on literature yesterday morning, a send-off to me, rather like Polonius to Laertes. It is quite true that you have had infinitely more influence on me intellectually than anyone else, and for this alone, I love you...You do like me to write well, don't you? And I do hate writing badly-and having written so badly in the past. But now, like Queen Victoria, I will be good".|$|E
