5|$|This pyramid was {{the last}} pyramid ever built {{as part of a}} {{mortuary}} complex in Egypt. The pyramid would be abandoned by subsequent pharaohs of the New Kingdom, for both practical and religious reasons. The Giza plateau offered plenty of room for building pyramids; but {{this was not the case}} with the confined, cliff-bound geography of Thebes and any burials in the surrounding desert were vulnerable to flooding. The <b>pyramid</b> <b>form</b> was associated with the sun god Re, who had been overshadowed by Amun in importance. One of the meanings of Amun's name was the hidden one, which meant that it was now theologically permissible to hide the Pharaoh's tomb by fully separating the mortuary template from the actual burial place. This provided the added advantage that the resting place of the pharaoh could be kept hidden from necropolis robbers. All subsequent pharaohs of the New Kingdom would be buried in rock-cut shaft tombs in the Valley of the Kings.|$|E
25|$|Djoser’s Step Pyramid complex {{has several}} {{structures}} pivotal to its function in both {{life and the}} afterlife. Several are discussed below with attention paid to function and form.

The symbolism of the step <b>pyramid</b> <b>form,</b> which did not survive the 3rd Dynasty, is unknown, but {{it has been suggested that}} it may be a monumental symbol of the crown, especially the royal mortuary cult, since seven small step pyramids (not tombs) were built in the provinces.

Lieutenant Colonel Nangle offered a location overlooking Y Ravine within the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial site. The Y ravine had been the scene of fierce fighting for the division on 13 November 1916. The selected sculptor for the 51st Division Monument was George Henry Paulin. The base of the monument consists of rough blocks of Rubislaw granite which were produced by Garden & Co. in Aberdeen, Scotland, and are assembled in a <b>pyramid</b> <b>form.</b> Company Sergeant Major Bob Rowan of the Glasgow Highlanders was used as the model for the kilted figure atop {{the memorial}}. The figure faces east towards the village of Beaumont-Hamel. On the front is a plaque inscribed in Gaelic: [...] which in English translates as [...] "Friends are good on the day of battle". The 51st Division Monument was unveiled on 28 September 1924 by Marshal of France Ferdinand Foch, the former Allied Supreme Commander. The memorial was rededicated on 13 July 1958, the front panel now referring to not only those who died during the First World War but the Second as well. A wooden Celtic cross directly across the track from the memorial was originally sited at High Wood and subsequently moved to the Newfoundland site. The cross commemorates the men of the 51st Highland Division who fell at High Wood in July 1916.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} sputter-induced {{topographical}} development {{have shown that}} it is possible to <b>form</b> <b>pyramids</b> on single-crystal fcc metals oriented in the crystallographic direction. These <b>pyramids</b> <b>form</b> when the surface is bombarded with relatively large (> 1 x 1019 cm- 2) doses of Ar+, Kr+ or Xe+ ions in the energy range 20 - 41 keV. Until recently most of the work was con to pure fee metals (Cu, Pd, Ir, Ag, Au), all of which exhibit similar pyramid formation on bombardment. Later studies involving Cu, however, showed that, although <b>pyramids</b> <b>form</b> with inert-gas ion (e. g. Ar+ on Cu) or self-ion (Cu+ on Cu) bombardment, they are not produced when either Br+, Fe+ or Ni+ ions are used. This observation led to further investigations of alloying effects on topographic evolvement during sputtering. We report here a study of the influence of alloying on pyramid formation on single crystals, through comparison of that of Ni and Cu with that of Ni- 8 %Cu. We find that bombardment with Ar+ ions can produce pyramids on Ni- 8 %Cu but that the conditions necessary are different from those for pure metals. We have looked for sputter-induced segregation effects in the alloy but none have been observed...|$|R

The balance theory of garment simulation integrally studies the complex system of human body–fabric–environment. At the same time, the method of obtaining the heat and moisture transfer balance equations is also based on the mass conservation law, the energy conservation law and the Fish law of capillarity. A finite volume method is employed to solve the ICAD-balance equations...|$|E
