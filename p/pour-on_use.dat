40|$|The broad {{spectrum}} of endectocides and the easy use mode of their pour-on formulations are factors that have stimulated a higher frequency of use these drugs in cattle. In this study was evaluated the efficacy of ivermectin <b>pour-on</b> <b>using</b> the dose of 500 mcgkg(- 1), against nematodes in naturally infected cattle from different herds. Twelve calves were brought {{from each of the}} four farms selected. All the 48 calves used showed mean of eggs per gram of feces (EPG) greater than 500 considering three consecutive counts. Subsequently, animals from each herd were divided into two groups of six animals each, one treated pour-on with ivermectin 500 mcgkg(- 1) and other kept as untreated control. Calves were euthanized 14 days after treatment for counting the endoparasites. Ivermectin showed null effect against H. placei in all the herds evaluated. The drug was also ineffective against C. punctata in the herds from Jaboticabal, SP and Formiga, MG, and reached efficacy of 75. 8 % and 58. 4 % in herds from Sao Jose do Rio Pardo, SP and Sao Sebastiao do Para so, MG, respectively. Efficacies of 94. 2 % (Jaboticabal), 0. 0 % (Sao Jose do Rio Pardo), 94. 2 % (Formiga) and 39. 2 % (Sao Sebastiao do Para so) were detectedagainstO. radiatum. Based on these results obtained on the present study, the four populations of Haemonchus placei and Cooperia punctata evaluated were resistant to ivermectin <b>pour-on</b> <b>using</b> a dose of 500 mcgkg(- 1). Ivermectin-resistant strains of Oesophagostomum radiatum were found in two of the four herds evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Animal {{trypanosomosis}} {{is particularly}} important in Ethipia where 7 - 10 million cattle are at risk. A geo-referenced census of over 5000 households was conducted between March and July 1996 to better understand factors affecting demand of the a cypermethrin <b>pour-ons</b> <b>used</b> since January 1991 to control tsetse in Ghibe, Ethiopia. Since December 1992, farmers have paid 3 Ethiopian Birr (US$ 0. 50) for each pour-on treatment offered once a month at 9 supply centres. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and econometrics were used to identify and quantify effects of different economic, demographic and spatial factors on farmer demand for the pour-ons. Results show that household-level demand for the pour-on depends upon season, characteristics of the household head, structure of the cattle herd, distance to the nearest supply point and characteristics of the household's neighbours. Demand is highest in the wet season and lowest in the dry season. Female-headed households {{were more likely to}} treat their cattle than male-headed households, while households located farther from the treatment centres were less likely to treat. Households whose neighbours treated a large number of animals were more likely to treat, while households, with a large number of cattle-owning neighbours were less likely to treat. These results suggest that there is a type of informal collective action occurring supported by peoples' observation of their neighbours' behaviour...|$|R
40|$|To {{eliminate}} {{the potential for}} insect borne diseases and improve productivity in cow-calf operations, many producers <b>use</b> <b>pour-on</b> pyrethroids. However, popular press literature has identified potential links between use of pyrethroids and reproductive function failures in bulls. While literature in mice and rats have reported potential endocrine disruption of sex steroids resulting from pyrethroid exposure, effects of pyrethroid use on bull fertility is still questionable. The objective {{of this study was}} to measure reproductive parameters in peripubertal Angus bulls using a commonly <b>used</b> pyrethroid <b>pour-on.</b> We hypothesized that use of a pyrethroid pour-on at labeled dose would have limited effects on semen and testicular characteristics. Results from this study revealed pyrethroid-treated bulls had greater spermatozoa head and midpiece abnormalities compared to controls, resulting in higher primary morphological abnormalities. Although some morphological semen parameters appear to be negatively affected by use of pyrethroid administration in bulls, biological relevance of this result needs to be further elucidated as the ability to pass a breeding soundness exam was not affected. Moreover, further research should be conducted to determine the effects of pyrethroid pour-ons on fertility when used with other pyrethroids such fly tags or perimeter sprays. Based on these results, <b>pour-on</b> pyrethroid <b>use</b> in yearling bulls is still recommended for label dose administration...|$|R
40|$|These days one of {{the real}} {{problems}} that cause the prejudice economic in animal farms yearly is parasitic diseases. For that reason to prevent these problems the use of antiparasitic drugs is necessary. Ivermectin is a broad spectrum antiparasitic agent and different dosage forms such as injection, oral and <b>pour-on</b> <b>used.</b> The aims of this study were evaluation of the efficacy of ivermectin pour-on administration against natural dictyocaulus viviparous nematode infections in cattle and also determine the prevalence rate of this parasite in Tabriz area. In this study in 120 heads of male and female hybrid cattle were carried out LPG (larves per gram of feces) feces test. Willis method was applied for feces test and Stoll method was used for counting nematode larves (LPG). After confirm worm contamination and counting dictyocaulus viviparous nematode larves in feces in infected animals, ivermectin (0. 5 mg kg - 1) pour-on was administrated. Feces test was repeated in 1, 7, 21 and 28 day after treatment. Results showed that total prevalence of dictyocaulus viviparous nematode infections was 5 % cattle’s of Tabriz area. The effects of ivermectin pour-on on dictyocaulus viviparous nematode were 42. 18, 54. 68, 90. 62 and 99. 21 % in 1, 7, 21 and 28 day, respectively. In conclusion because the effect of this drug against dictyocaulus viviparous nematode was > 99 % (p< 0. 05) so in cattle can use this drug in antiparasitic program.

40|$|In {{this study}} the parasitological status of two herds of beef suckler cows {{successively}} grazed on different pastures was investigated. In both herds bulls were present the whole summer {{so that the}} calving period lasted for almost the whole year. The first herd consisted of 218 pregnant Irish Hereford heifers which had been imported from Ireland. Their pasture of 187 ha was dry with sandy soil. At {{the beginning of this}} study the animals showed a low infestation with gastrointestinal nematodes, tapeworms, liver flukes, lungworms and coccidia. The second herd consisted of 127 crossbred animals of Galloway with SMR-cattle, Limousin and Piemontese. They were kept on 270 ha of marshy pasture. They were infested with gastrointestinal nematodes, tapeworms and coccidia. A representative number of dams and all female calves were examined for parasites at regular intervals. Depending on the results of these examinations, a treatment regime for parasite control was carried out. The first prophylactic treatment of all animals against ectoparasites, lungworms and gastrointestinal nematodes was carried out with Ivomec® pour-on and took place in autumn 1993. It was necessary because the animals, especially those on the marshy pasture, showed a relatively high parasite infestation. This treatment eliminated all lungworms. The second strategic treatment in May 1994, again with Ivomec® pour-on, was combined with a change of pasture and aimed at keeping the gastrointestinal nematodes at a low level. At the same time the Irish Hereford dams were treated with Rafoxanid (Raniden®) in order to eliminate liver flukes. Because of a sharp increase in the fly population a single treatment with Bayofly® pour-on was carried out in July 1994. At the end of the growing season all animals were strategically treated for the third time, again <b>using</b> Ivomec® <b>pour-on.</b> <b>Using</b> this treatment strategy enabled the parasite infestations in all animals, including calves, to be kept on a subclinical level.

40|$|The {{prophylactic}} {{efficacy of}} microdoses of injectable and pour-on ivermectin formulations against larval stages of Przhevalskiana silenus was assessed in naturally infected goats {{in the region}} of Calabria (southern Italy). Sixty-eight goats from two goat farms were divided into five groups: one group remained untreated, while the other four groups were treated with microdoses of ivermectin (5 and 10 microg/kg injectable formulation and 10 and 20 microg/kg pour-on formulation). The microdoses of ivermectin were fully effective in the treatment of goat warble fly infestation (GWFI) as no larvae emerged from the warbles in the treated groups, while all the larvae emerged in the control groups. Irrespective of the type of formulation used, the difference between the treated groups and the control group was statistically significant (P< 0. 001). By contrast, no statistical {{differences were found between the}} goats treated with the injectable formulation and those receiving the pour-on applications, and between the two doses of the injectable and <b>pour-on</b> formulations <b>used.</b> Given the plasma concentrations it attains at its lowest dose (0. 052 - 0. 042 ng/ml for the injectable formulation and 0. 030 ng/ml for the pour-on) the injectable formulation seems to offer the most reliable route for the administration of ivermectin microdoses and it is acceptable for milk consumption. The introduction of ivermectin in the early eighties and the use of microdoses in some cases have made it possible to control cattle hypodermosis in large areas of Europe. As with cattle hypodermosis, the administration of ivermectin microdoses in goats is particularly interesting because of the low costs involved and the low levels of residues found in goat milk; it may thus constitute the basis for GWFI control campaigns in areas where the disease is prevalent...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background This study {{aimed at}} {{determining}} {{the extent of}} tick infestations in extensively grazed cattle and assess the efficacy of Ecotix ® acaricide (2. 5 % high cis cypermethrin) in Mvomero district in Tanzania. A total of 1200 Tanzanian short horn Zebu (TSHZ) from two farms in two villages were qualitatively assessed for tick infestations and 40 animals (grouped in 10 s from each farm) were separated in their herds and quantitatively examined to establish the tick load. The animals were grouped in treatment regime groups (TxRG 1, 2, 3, and 4), TxRG 1 being the control group was treated with water. Ecotix ® was applied on day 0 for TxRG 2, days 0 and 7 for TxRG 3 and days 0, 7 and 14 for TxRG 4 and tick load was monitored for 28 days. Results All the animals examined were infested with ticks. The identified ticks were Rhipicephalus appendiculatus (55 %), Amblyomma variegatum (18 %), R. (Boophilus) microplus (12. 9 %), R. (B) decoloratus (7. 1 %), R. evertsi evertsi (4. 4 %) and R. composites (2. 6 %). The overall mean (mean ± SEM) tick density on day zero was 63 ± 30 ticks per animal (ranging from 20 – 160). The mean tick density on day zero was 44. 6 ± 25. 4, 74. 6 ± 30. 3, 55. 0 ± 26. 2 and 77 ± 33. 5 for groups one, two, three and four respectively. Post-treatment quantitative assessment of tick burden revealed that the TxRG 1 animals maintained a tick load throughout the study period. A significant decrease in tick load in animals in groups TxRG 2, 3 and 4 (P= 0. 0001) with increasing frequency of Ecotix ® application was recorded. There was however {{no significant difference in}} tick reduction between TxRG 3 and 4 (P= 0. 0986). Thus TxRG 3 would be sufficient for the monthly tick treatment and with this regime, the farmer would save up to 2. 5 USD per animal during six months of dry season. Conclusions The study revealed a high tick infestation among the TSHZ kept in extensive grazing systems in Mvomero district and that when treated with Ecotix ® as <b>pour-on</b> preparation <b>using</b> a two application regime per month, the tick control strategy was effective. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chemical {{control method}} using {{different}} acaricides as spray, dipping solution or <b>pour-on</b> is routinely <b>used</b> for controlling ticks. Biological control agents are favorable {{due to their}} safety for animals and environment. Entomopathogenic fungi such as Beauveria bassiana are well known for controlling ticks. In this study, two Iranian indigenous strains of B. bassiana (B. bassiana 5197 and B. bassiana Evin) were selected and grown on specific me&shy;dia. The pathogenic effects of these strains were evaluated on adult stages of two Iranian Ixodidae members (H. anatolicum anatolicum Koch 1844, and H. marginatum Koch 1844) by dipping method. "nMethods: Two Iranian strains of Beauveria bassiana (Beauveria bassiana 5197 and Beauveria bassiana Evin) were selected and were grown successfully on specific media. The pathogenic effects of these strains were evaluated on adult stages of Iranian Ixodidae members such as, Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum and H. marginatum by dipping method (these ticks were grown up at laboratory conditions during 2002 up to 2003 and still it is continued). "nResults: There was no effect of strain 5197 on mortality or fecundity rates for ticks. There was acute phase sign of paralysis in test group after dipping ticks in suspension made from Evin strain of B. bassiana. In addition, the test groups were totally died after four months, but the control groups survived for six months.

40|$|Apilot survey using a {{structured}} questionnaire {{was conducted in}} Tororo and Busia districts of Uganda on the knowledge and attitudes of cattle owners regarding tsetse fly and trypanosomosis control, {{in order to understand}} factors that hindered their full participation. A total of 81 cattle owners was randomly selected and interviewed, of which 92. 5 % were aware of tsetse flies and trypanosomosis and 87. 6 %recognised animal trypanosomosis as a problem in the area. Most cattle owners were aware of tsetse fly trapping (76. 5 %), isometamidium chloride use (55. 5 %), diminazene aceturate use (48 %) and pour-on applications (18. 5 %). However, knowledge did not coincide with the application of control measures. Despite the widespread awareness, tsetse fly trapping and <b>pour-on</b> applications were <b>used</b> by {{only a small percentage of}} cattle owners (7. 5 % applied tsetse fly trapping while 76. 5 %were aware of it; 1. 2 %applied pour-oninsecticides while 18. 5 %were aware of them). Differences between awareness and application were highly significant for tsetse fly trapping (c 2 = 67. 8, d. f. = 1, P&lt; 0. 001) and pour-on applications (c 2 = 10. 8, d. f. = 1, P&lt; 0. 05), but not for isometamidium chloride use (c 2 = 0. 08, d. f. = 1, P = 0. 77) and diminazene aceturate use (c 2 = 0. 00, d. f. = 1, P = 1. 00). Most cattle owners (97. 5 %) were willing to participate in future control programmes, but preferred participating on a group basis (85. 2 %) rather than individually (14. 8 %). The 4 most favoured control options in order of importance were: fly traps supplied by the government and maintained by cattle owners; contribution of labour by cattle owners for trap deployment; self-financing of trypanocidal drugs and self-financing of pour-on insecticide. The control options that should be selected in order to elicit full participation by cattle owners are discussed...|$|R
