5|$|Mechanical {{pest control}} {{is the use}} of {{hands-on}} techniques as well as simple equipment and devices, that provides a protective barrier between plants and insects. This is referred to as tillage {{and is one of the}} oldest methods of weed control as well as being useful for pest control; wireworms, the larvae of the common click beetle, are very destructive pests of newly <b>ploughed</b> grassland, and repeated cultivation exposes them to the birds and other predators that feed on them.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ploughing</b> {{includes}} tilling of soil, intercultural <b>ploughing</b> {{and summer}} <b>ploughing.</b> <b>Ploughing</b> uproots weeds, {{causing them to}} die. In summer <b>ploughing</b> is done during deep summers. Summer <b>ploughing</b> also helps in killing pests.|$|R
25|$|It {{seemed an}} obvious {{progression}} to use Fowler’s latest steam-driven <b>plough</b> for normal <b>ploughing,</b> {{rather than just}} drainage channels. However normal <b>ploughing</b> was much lighter work that could be achieved perfectly well {{by a team of}} horses and in comparison the steam-driven <b>plough</b> was rather cumbersome. One way of improving the <b>plough’s</b> efficiency would be to design a <b>plough</b> that could <b>plough</b> in either direction without having to be turned round. Fowler achieved this by designing a frame for the <b>plough</b> that had two <b>ploughs</b> attached as a kind of see-saw. One of the two <b>plough</b> blades would be swung down to make contact with the soil, depending on the direction the <b>plough</b> was to travel. At the end of each furrow the anchored pulleys would be moved slightly ready for the next furrow.|$|R
40|$|A {{long-term}} {{experiment was}} established to examine the crop yield and the weed infestation, focussed on Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), as effect of different intensity of primary tillage (mouldboard <b>plough</b> deep or shallow, double-layer <b>plough,</b> chisel <b>plough)</b> in combination with or without stubble tillage. The most effective ways to keep the infestation of C. arvense at a low level were deep mouldboard <b>ploughing</b> {{and the use of}} a double-layer <b>plough.</b> After the experiment had run seven years, the thistle biomass was < 2 g DM m- 2 in these treatments, compared to 23 – 26 g DM m- 2 in the treatments with chisel <b>ploughing</b> or shallow <b>ploughing.</b> In all treatments, stubble tillage in addition to primary tillage significantly reduced the thistle biomass by 30 – 80 %. A high density of lucerne/grass re-growth occurred in the chisel <b>plough</b> treatment. The soil seed bank of thistles ranged between 220 (deep <b>plough)</b> and 6, 400 seeds m- 2 (chisel <b>plough)</b> in the sixth year of the experiment. Stubble tillage is essential if the chisel <b>plough</b> or shallow <b>ploughing</b> is used for conservation tillage in organic farming. The double-layer <b>plough</b> can control C. arvense comparable to deep <b>ploughing...</b>|$|R

5|$|An even {{checkerboard}} plot model {{dominates the}} green landscape {{during the rainy}} season, which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ {{only in terms of}} soil type and location. Where mangroves are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice paddy fields between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Rice farmers must therefore build levees, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and shrimp which subsequently become trapped are harvested {{at the end of the}} rainy season, when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and <b>ploughed.</b> Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil.|$|E
25|$|Early steel <b>ploughs,</b> {{like those}} for {{thousands}} of years prior, were walking <b>ploughs,</b> directed by the ploughman holding onto handles {{on either side of the}} <b>plough.</b> The steel <b>ploughs</b> were so much easier to draw through the soil that the constant adjustments of the blade to react to roots or clods was no longer necessary, as the <b>plough</b> could easily cut through them. Consequently, it was not long after that the first riding <b>ploughs</b> appeared. On these, wheels kept the <b>plough</b> at an adjustable level above the ground, while the ploughman sat on a seat; whereas, with earlier <b>ploughs</b> the ploughman would have had to walk. Direction was now controlled mostly through the draught team, with levers allowing fine adjustments. This led very quickly to riding <b>ploughs</b> with multiple mouldboards, dramatically increasing <b>ploughing</b> performance.|$|R

5|$|Keynsham rugby {{football}} club play at Crown Field. The club's most notable and tragic event occurred on 24 December 1992, {{when there was}} a fatal road accident outside the club's ground. A Ford Fiesta car <b>ploughed</b> into 11 people leaving the annual festive disco. One woman, 21-year-old Sarah Monnelle, died at the scene. A second person, 24-year-old rugby player Richard Barnett, died in hospital two days later from his injuries.

5|$|To date, the {{excavation}} project at Fort Tanjong Katong has ended {{and only the}} south-eastern bastion, which was nearly fully excavated, has been cordoned off indefinitely (the south-western bastion was left untouched). Except for the cordoned off bastion, other exposed fort remains were reburied again in December 2005 by the National Parks Board, which runs the park, to protect them against the elements for future archaeologists to discover. It was also done because the dug-out pits could well breed mosquitoes; there were also fears that someone might {{fall into one of}} the 2 m-deep holes. The remaining funds, about S$150,000, were <b>ploughed</b> back into bursaries and scholarships for the constituency's students.|$|E
5|$|Commander Alfred Godsal led {{the assault}} in HMS Brilliant {{and it was}} he who {{stumbled}} into the most effective German counter-measure first. As Brilliant staggered through the murk, the lookout spotted the buoy ahead and Godsal headed directly for it, coming under even heavier fire as he did so. Passing the navigation marker at speed, the cruiser was suddenly brought to a halt with a juddering lurch, throwing men to the decks and sticking fast in deep mud well outside the harbour mouth. Before warnings could be relayed to the Sirius following up close behind, she too passed the buoy and her captain Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy was shocked to see Brilliant dead ahead. With no time to manoeuvree, Sirius <b>ploughed</b> into the port quarter of Brilliant, the blockships settling into the mud in a tangle of wreckage.|$|E

50|$|The Scotch <b>plough</b> or Scots <b>plough</b> (not to be {{confused}} with the Scottish hand <b>plough)</b> was a wood and iron, animal draft, primary tillage implement (<b>plough)</b> for use on heavy ground invented in the 19th century by James Anderson.|$|R
5|$|During the Second World War, matches at heavily {{attended}} grounds {{were initially}} prohibited {{due to the}} fear of aerial bombing by the Luftwaffe. Scottish national league and cup competitions were suspended {{for the duration of}} the war, but regional league and cup competitions were established in their place. Attendance was initially restricted to 50 percent of capacity; therefore, when 75,000 attended a wartime cup final in May 1940, it was the maximum permitted. The Parashots, a forerunner of the Home Guard, set up a command post at Lesser Hampden in 1940. A government official presented an order demanding that both the Hampden and Lesser Hampden pitches be <b>ploughed</b> and used to plant vegetables, but the Queen's Park committee chose to ignore the order and the government did not pursue it. Wartime internationals were played at Hampden, and 91,000 saw Scotland beat England 5–4 on 18 April 1942.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{takes place}} {{mostly on the}} ground in open areas and to some extent in trees. Landfill sites, bins, streets, and gardens are also visited, more often early in the morning when there are fewer people about. Various feeding methods are employed, such as jumping, pecking, clod-turning and scattering, probing the soil, and occasionally, digging. Flies around cow pats are caught by jumping from the ground or at times by {{dropping}} vertically from a few metres onto the cow pat. Earthworms are not usually extracted from the ground by western jackdaws but are eaten from freshly <b>ploughed</b> soil. Jackdaws will ride on the backs of sheep and other mammals, seeking ticks as well as actively gathering wool or hair for nests, and will catch flying ants in flight. Compared with other corvids, the western jackdaw spends more time exploring and turning over objects with its bill; it also has a straighter and less downturned bill and increased binocular vision which are advantageous for this foraging strategy.|$|E
5|$|Like all Australasian robins, {{the flame}} robin is a perch and pounce hunter, mainly eating insects, and often {{returning}} to a favourite low perch several times to stand erect and motionless, scanning the leaf-litter for more prey. They are typically seen in pairs (during {{the spring and summer}} breeding season) or in loose companies in more open country in winter, when they more commonly feed on the ground. A field study in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales found no significant difference in foraging behaviour between male and female flame robins. Birds have been recorded foraging for insects in furrows in freshly <b>ploughed</b> fields. In Deniliquin, a flame robin was observed holding one foot forward and pattering the ground repeatedly to disturb ground-dwelling insects, and then watching and snapping up any which emerged; this behaviour is otherwise seen in waders.|$|E

25|$|The {{advent of}} the mobile steam engine allowed steam power {{to be applied to}} <b>ploughing</b> from about 1850. In Europe, soil {{conditions}} were often too soft to support the weight of heavy traction engines. Instead, counterbalanced, wheeled <b>ploughs,</b> known as balance <b>ploughs,</b> were drawn by cables across the fields by pairs of <b>ploughing</b> engines on opposite field edges, or by a single engine drawing directly towards it at one end and drawing away from it via a pulley at the other end. The balance <b>plough</b> had two sets of <b>ploughs</b> facing each other, arranged so when one was in the ground, the other set was lifted into the air. When pulled in one direction, the trailing <b>ploughs</b> were lowered onto the ground by the tension on the cable. When the <b>plough</b> reached the edge of the field, the other engine pulled the opposite cable, and the <b>plough</b> tilted (balanced), putting the other set of shares into the ground, and the <b>plough</b> worked back across the field.|$|R
25|$|Modern {{competitions}} {{take place}} for <b>ploughing</b> enthusiasts like the National <b>Ploughing</b> Championships in Ireland.

5|$|Round {{the rims}} of deserts, where more {{precipitation}} occurred and conditions were more suitable, some groups took to cultivating crops. This {{may have happened}} when drought caused the death of herd animals, forcing herdsmen to turn to cultivation. With few inputs, {{they were at the}} mercy of the weather and may have lived at bare subsistence level. The land they cultivated reduced the area available to nomadic herders, causing disputes over land. The semi-arid fringes of the desert have fragile soils which are at risk of erosion when exposed, as happened in the American Dust Bowl in the 1930s. The grasses that held the soil in place were <b>ploughed</b> under, and a series of dry years caused crop failures, while enormous dust storms blew the topsoil away. Half a million Americans were forced to leave their land in this catastrophe.|$|E
5|$|Under Henry's son, King Richard I, a {{new land}} tax was collected, {{the first since}} 1162. It was {{organised}} by Hubert Walter, the Justiciar of England {{who was in charge}} of governing England while the king was gone. Like the geld, the carucage was based on the amount of land owned, thus targeting free men rather than serfs, who owned no land and were therefore exempt. First collected in 1194, and the first land tax collected in England since the geld, carucage was based on the size of the estate as measured in either hides or carucates (a unit of land that could be <b>ploughed</b> by an eight-ox plough-team in a year, which was normally considered equivalent to a hide). The original property assessment of the carucage was based on the Domesday Survey, a survey of land holdings in England that was completed by 1087.|$|E
5|$|Young {{birds are}} {{initially}} mainly fed on invertebrates, often collected from low foliage or under bushes {{rather than in}} the grassland preferred by the adults. Adults will roam up to 1km (1000yd) from the nest on pasture or <b>ploughed</b> land. After fledging the young may accompany their parents until the onset of winter. Individuals or pairs will defend one or more fruit-bearing trees throughout the winter, mistletoe being preferred where available, with holly as the first choice elsewhere. Although the thrush normally feeds on the ground or other trees, the defence of this resource conserves the fruit for later in the season when other food items are becoming scarce. The trees are defended against conspecifics, other thrushes and species such as the bullfinch and great spotted woodpecker. In years when there is an abundance of winter fruit, this strategy may be abandoned, with the mistle thrushes foraging in flocks. Conversely, in hard winters, the defender may be overwhelmed by large flocks of fieldfares, redwings or Bohemian waxwings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Ploughing</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} power {{consuming}} and expensive processes in agricultural production. It is known that the draft resistance of <b>ploughs,</b> the energy requirement for <b>ploughing,</b> the quality of <b>ploughing</b> and expenses depend on the <b>plough</b> body design, which is determined by the share-mouldboard parameters and the parameters of its supporting surfaces, as well as on such soil properties as its hardness, density, friction and adhesion, values of which are depending on soil mechanical composition, structure and humidity. Studies are carried out to determine the impact of the soil humidity on the <b>ploughing</b> resistance of the main soil types: sandy soil, loam and clay soils. It was cleared up that humidity most of all impacts the soil hardness and cutting resistance which considerably dominates in the summary resistance of the <b>plough</b> body. Increase in the soil humidity leads to decrease in the <b>ploughing</b> resistance that is more remarkable on clay soils. The working speed of the <b>plough</b> influences also the <b>ploughing</b> resistance. The optimum humidity of sticky clay soils when <b>ploughing</b> at the speed 2 … 2. 5 m s- 1 is 18 … 22 %. Key words: <b>ploughing</b> resistance, impact of soil humidity, soil hardness, soil density, soil friction, soil adhesion, dynamics of soil properties...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. If basal-water {{discharge}} {{and pressure}} are sufficiently high, a soft-bedded glacier will slip over its bed by <b>ploughing,</b> {{the process in}} which particles that span the ice–bed interface are dragged across the bed surface. Results of laboratory experiments indicate that resistance to <b>ploughing</b> can decrease with increasing <b>ploughing</b> velocity (velocity weakening). During <b>ploughing</b> at various velocities (15 – 400 ma– 1), till was compacted in front of idealized particles, causing pore pressures there that were orders of magnitude higher than the ambient value. This excess pore pressure locally weakened the till in shear, thereby decreasing <b>ploughing</b> resistance {{by a factor of}} 3. 0 – 6. 6 with a six-fold increase in <b>ploughing</b> velocity. Characteristic timescales of pore-pressure diffusion and compaction down-glacier from <b>ploughing</b> particles depend on till diffusivity, <b>ploughing</b> velocity and sizes of <b>ploughing</b> particles. These timescales accurately predict the ranges of these variables over which excess pore pressure and velocity weakening occurred. Existing <b>ploughing</b> models do not account for velocity weakening. A new <b>ploughing</b> model with no adjustable parameters predicts <b>ploughing</b> resistance to no worse than 38 % but requires that excess pore pressures be measured. Velocity weakening by this mechanism may affect fast glacier flow, sediment transport by bed deformation and basal seismicity. 1...|$|R
5|$|Carpender was not inflexible, {{and reached}} a {{compromise}} with Mackay to transport a battalion to Finschhafen in high speed transports (APDs). Herring was in Dobodura, lunching with Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell, {{when he heard}} this news. He decided to fly to Milne Bay {{to discuss the matter}} of resupply in general with Barbey. On 28 September, Herring and two of his staff officers, Brigadiers R. B. Sutherland and R. Bierwirth, boarded a U.S. Fifth Air Force B-25 Mitchell bomber at Dobodura. As the plane was about to take off, the undercarriage collapsed and the plane <b>ploughed</b> into the Marston Mat runway. A propeller shattered, splinters ripped through the fuselage into the cabin and Sutherland, who was sitting in the navigator's compartment next to Herring, was struck by a flying fragment that killed him instantly. The crew, Herring and Bierwirth escaped shaken but unscathed. The trip to Milne Bay was cancelled. Brigadier Sutherland was buried with full military honours at Soputa the next day, with a fly past by B-25s. When next he flew, Herring once again took a B-25 and made a point of requesting the major who had been in charge of the crashed plane to be his pilot.|$|E
5|$|Formal gardens {{were laid}} out around the house by W. A. Nesfield in around 1840–50 for Hungerford Crewe. Nesfield's design {{included}} statuary, gravelled walks and elaborate parterres realised using low box hedges and coloured minerals. Balustraded terraces were also constructed on {{the north and south}} sides of the hall, probably designed by E. M. Barry, and incorporating statues of lions, griffins and other heraldic beasts, echoing the interior staircase. Military usage during the Second World War, however, destroyed parts of the gardens; army buildings were erected near the house, and the area in front of the hall served as a parade ground and later was <b>ploughed</b> up to grow potatoes. The grounds were further neglected while the house was used as offices, and little has survived except the terraces, gates and statues. In 2009, English Heritage placed the hall on the Heritage at Risk Register as highly vulnerable, considering that the historic character of the gardens and park is compromised by recent developments to the hotel complex, in particular the conference centre, spa and associated parking area.|$|E
5|$|Page and MacLachlan flew to No. 96 Squadron RAF {{which was}} then flying de Havilland Mosquito night fighters.

MacLachlan and Page flew to Tangmere on 15 July. On his next mission on 18 July 1943 MacLachlan's Mustang FD442 was probably hit by ground fire when crossing the French coast near Dieppe. Page noticed MacLachlan's Mustang suddenly pull up sharply from their tree-top height by about 1,000 feet. He saw MacLachlan pull back the canopy but apparently {{changed his mind about}} bailing out as the aircraft leveled out and descended. The Mustang then headed towards a small field. MacLachaln touched down three-quarters the way across and the Mustang <b>ploughed</b> into an orchard at the field's edge which ripped off the wings. Page orbited the crash site several times and considered landing to rescue him but the space was too confined. Page dived at the wreck and took gun-camera footage but could see no signs of life and then headed home. The Operations Record was unable to determine the cause of the crash. MacLachlan made no radio broadcast. It was possibly the result of enemy small-arms fire or mechanical failure. On 30 July MacLachlan was awarded a second Bar to his DFC.|$|E

40|$|The {{reduction}} of soil tillage depth is {{of special interest}} in organic farming.

Peas and cereals were grown as sole crops and intercrops under shallow and deep <b>ploughing</b> in experiments on a sandy loam soil in Northern Germany in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Semi-leafless spring peas-oats, semi-leafless winter peas-triticale and regular-leaf type winter peas-triticale intercrops were examined. At harvest, weed shoot biomass in semi-leafless spring and winter pea sole crops under deep <b>ploughing</b> were slightly higher than those of the corresponding intercrops under shallow <b>ploughing.</b> Whereas weed shoot biomass in semi-leafless winter peas-triticale intercrops under deep <b>ploughing</b> was comparable to shallow <b>ploughing,</b> the cultivation of spring peas-oats intercrops under shallow <b>ploughing</b> led to a significantly higher weed growth than did deep <b>ploughing.</b> The regular-leaf type winter pea grown as a sole crop, or an intercrop with triticale, showed a higher weed suppressive ability than the semi-leafless peas. The tillage system had no significant influence on the weed infestation of sole and intercropped regular-leaf type winter peas. Semi-leafless spring peas-oats and winter peas-triticale intercrops could compensate for weed infestation differences under shallow <b>ploughing</b> compared to the corresponding pea sole crops under deep <b>ploughing.</b> Due to the high weed suppressive ability of regular-leaf type winter peas, shallow <b>ploughing</b> and deep <b>ploughing,</b> as well as sole cropping and intercropping, led to comparable weed infestation...|$|R
