40|$|Recently, {{reversible}} <b>photoswitching</b> in {{bulk samples}} or in individual molecules of Dronpa, a mutant {{of a green}} fluorescent protein (GFP) -like fluorescent protein, has been demonstrated. Intense irradiation at 488 nm changed Dronpa in a dim protonated form, and weak irradiation at 405 nm restored it to the bright deprotonated form. Here, {{we report on the}} mechanism of <b>photoswitching</b> of Dronpa by means of ensemble and single-molecule spectroscopy. Ensemble spectroscopy shows that the <b>photoswitching</b> can be described, in first approximation, by a three-state model including a deprotonated (B), a protonated (A(1)), and a <b>photoswitched</b> protonated (A(2)) forms of the chromophore. While the B and the A 1 forms are in a ground state acid-base equilibrium, the B and the A 2 forms are reversibly <b>photoswitched</b> upon irradiation with 488 and 405 nm light. At the single-molecule level, the on-times in fluorescence intensity trajectories excited at 488 nm decrease with increasing the excitation power, consistent with the <b>photoswitching</b> from the B to A(2) form. The on-times agree well with expected values, which are calculated based on the ensemble spectroscopic properties of Dronpa. The fluorescence trajectory obtained with simultaneous dual-color excitation at 488 and 405 nm demonstrates reversible <b>photoswitching</b> between the B and the A(2) forms at the single-molecule level. The efficency of the <b>photoswitching</b> from the A(2) to B form increased with increasing the excitation power of the 405 nm light.

Optical actuation of nanomechanical systems through {{the conversion of}} light to mechanical motion is particularly desirable because it promises reversible, ultra-fast, remote operation. Past studies in this area have mainly focused on solution-based molecular machine ensembles, but surface-bound photomechanical molecules {{are expected to be}} important for future applications in molecular machines, molecular electronics, and functional surfaces. Cryogenic ultra-high-vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy has been employed to study the surface-based photomechanical switching properties of a promising class of photomechanical molecule called azobenzene. In the case of tetra-tert-butyl-functionalized azobenzene (TTB-AB) molecules adsorbed on Au(111) reversible switching by means of ultraviolet and visible excitation is experimentally observed at the single-molecule level.

5000|$|Photopharmacology is an {{emerging}} approach in medicine in which drugs are activated and deactivated with light.

This is done to ultimately achieve control when and where drugs are active in a reversible manner, to prevent side effects and exposure to the environment of antibiotics. Switching drugs 'on' and 'off' is achieved by introducing photoswitches such as azobenzene, spiropyran or diarylethene into the drug. By introducing the <b>photoswitch,</b> the drug has two different states between which can be switched with light.

40|$|AbstractPhotoswitches are {{traditional}} pharmacologic agonists, antagonists, or channel blockers that are covalently modified with an azobenzene derivative. Azobenzene undergoes wavelength-dependent isomerization between cis and trans conformation. For some photoswitches, {{only one of}} these configurations is biologically active, resulting in light-dependent activation or inhibition of function. Photoswitches that feature a quaternary ammonium coupled to the azobenzene moiety cause light-dependent neuronal depolarization due to blockage of voltage-gated potassium channels. Two <b>photoswitch</b> strategies have been pursued. In the one-component strategy, the <b>photoswitch</b> is applied to native receptors; in the two-component strategy, the <b>photoswitch</b> is combined with virally-mediated expression of a genetically modified receptor, to which the <b>photoswitch</b> may covalently bind. The former approach is simpler but the latter allows precise anatomic targeting of <b>photoswitch</b> activity. Acrylamide-azobenzene-quaternary ammonium (AAQ) is the prototypical first-generation one-component <b>photoswitch.</b> When applied to retinas with outer retinal degeneration, ganglion cell firing occurs in response to blue light, and is abrogated by green light. In vivo, AAQ restored pupillary light responses and behavioral light responses in blind animals.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fluorescent {{proteins}} photoswitchable with noncytotoxic {{light irradiation}} and spectrally distinct from multiple available photoconvertible green-to-red probes are in high demand. We {{have developed a}} monomeric fluorescent protein, called PSmOrange 2, which is photoswitchable with blue light from an orange (ex. /em. at 546 nm/ 561 nm) to a far-red (ex. /em. at 619 nm/ 651 nm) form. Compared to another orange-to-far-red photoconvertable variant, PSmOrange 2 has blue-shifted <b>photoswitching</b> action spectrum, 9 -fold higher photoconversion contrast, and up to 10 -fold faster <b>photoswitching</b> kinetics. This results in the 4 -fold more PSmOrange 2 molecules being photoconverted in mammalian cells. Compared to common orange fluorescent proteins, such as mOrange, the orange form of PSmOrange has substantially higher photostability allowing its use in multicolor imaging applications to track dynamics of multiple populations of intracellular objects. The PSmOrange 2 photochemical properties allow its efficient <b>photoswitching</b> with common two-photon lasers and, moreover, via Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from green fluorescent donors. We have termed the latter effect a FRET-facilitated <b>photoswitching</b> and demonstrated it using several sets of interacting proteins.

Photorelease {{is the use}} of light to induce a moiety attached to the nanoparticle surface to detach. UCNPs of lanthanide-doped NaYF4 have been applied as remote control <b>photoswitches.</b> UCNPs are useful <b>photoswitches</b> because they can be irradiated with low-cost NIR radiation and convert it into UV radiation extremely locally. Photocatalytic systems can be enhanced with UCNPs by the same principle as solar cells. In titania coated with YF3:Yb/Tm UCNPs, degradation of pollutants was observed under NIR radiation. Normally low-energy NIR radiation cannot induce photocatalysis in titania, which has a band gap in the UV range. The excitation in titania results in a surface redox reaction which decomposes compounds near the surface. UCNPs enable cheap low-energy NIR photons to replace expensive UV photons. In biological contexts UV light is highly absorbed and causes tissue damage. However NIR is weakly absorbed and induces UCNP behavior in vivo.
