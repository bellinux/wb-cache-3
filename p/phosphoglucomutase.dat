40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Phosphoglucomutases</b> {{catalyze}} the interconversion of D-glucose 1 -phosphate and D-glucose 6 -phosphate, {{a reaction}} central to energy metabolism in all cells {{and to the}} synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides in bacterial cells. Two classes of <b>phosphoglucomutases</b> (R-PGM and β-PGM) are distinguished {{on the basis of}} their specificity for R- and β-glucose- 1 -phosphate. β-PGM is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily, which includes the sarcoplasmic Ca 2 +-ATPase, phosphomannomutase, and phosphoserine phosphatase. β-PGM is unusual among family members in that the common phosphoenzyme intermediate exists as a stable ground-state complex in this enzyme. Herein we report, for the first time, the three-dimensional structure of a β-PGM and the first view of the true phosphoenzyme intermediate in the HAD superfamily. The crystal structure of the Mg(II) complex of phosphorylated β-phosphoglucomutase (β-PGM) from Lactococcus lactis has been determined to 2. 3 Å resolution by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) phasing on selenomethionine, and refined to an Rcryst) 0. 24 and Rfree) 0. 28. The active site of β-PGM is located between the core and the cap domain and is freely solvent accessible. The residues within a 6 Åradius of the phosphorylated Asp 8 include Asp 10, Thr 16, Ser 114, Lys 145, Glu 169, and Asp 170.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>phosphoglucomutases</b> (PGM) Pgm 1, Pgm 2, and Pgm 3 of {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae were tested {{for their ability}} to interconvert ribose- 1 -phosphate and ribose- 5 -phosphate. The {{purified}} proteins were studied in vitro with regard to their kinetic properties on glucose- 1 -phosphate and ribose- 1 -phosphate. All tested enzymes were active on both substrates with Pgm 1 exhibiting only residual activity on ribose- 1 -phosphate. The Pgm 2 and Pgm 3 proteins had almost equal kinetic properties on ribose- 1 -phosphate, but Pgm 2 had a 2000 times higher preference for glucose- 1 -phosphate when compared to Pgm 3. The in vivo function of the PGMs was characterized by monitoring ribose- 1 -phosphate kinetics following a perturbation of the purine nucleotide balance.

2500|$|If {{blood glucose}} levels are high, the body needs {{a way to}} store the excess glucose. [...] After being {{converted}} to G6P, the molecule {{can be turned into}} glucose-1-phosphate by <b>phosphoglucomutase.</b> [...] Glucose-1-phosphate can then be combined with uridine triphosphate (UTP) to form UDP-glucose, driven by the hydrolysis [...] of UTP, releasing phosphate. [...] Now, the activated UDP-glucose can add to a growing glycogen molecule with the help of glycogen synthase. [...] This is a very efficient storage mechanism for glucose since it costs the body only 1 ATP to store the 1 glucose molecule and virtually no energy to remove it from storage. [...] It {{is important to note that}} glucose-6-phosphate is an allosteric activator of glycogen synthase, which makes sense because when the level of glucose is high the body should store the excess glucose as glycogen. [...] On the other hand, glycogen synthase is inhibited when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase during times of high stress or low levels of blood glucose, via hormone induction by glucagon or adrenaline.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} step, {{galactose}} mutarotase facilitates {{the conversion of}} β-D-galactose to α-D-galactose since this is the active form in the pathway.

In the third step, D-galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase converts galactose 1-phosphate to UDP-galactose using UDP-glucose as the uridine diphosphate source. Finally, UDP-galactose 4-epimerase recycles the UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose for the transferase reaction. Additionally, <b>phosphoglucomutase</b> converts the D-glucose 1-phosphate to D-glucose 6-phosphate.|$|E
