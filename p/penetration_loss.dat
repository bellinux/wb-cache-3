The trial will operate as a SFN in VHF band III on Channel 13F on a frequency of 239.200 MHz. This will happen after coverage verification at transmitter powers of 2 kW, 5 kW, and 10 kW. The total area covered by the trial is 21185km2 and the total gross population covered is 10 705 387 (21.5% of total SA population). It is envisaged that between 18 and 20 radio from the Public, Commercial and Community sectors will participate in the trial. The trial will allow the testing of:End-to-end technical functionalityExtent of portable mobile coverageSignal permeabilityDemonstrate digital radio services and value-added servicesPerformance in the field using typical consumer equipment and professional test and measurement equipment.The effects of vehicle <b>penetration</b> <b>loss,</b> building <b>penetration</b> <b>loss</b> and clutter (e.g. buildings and vegetation) on coverage.Testing of the various encoding methods (stereo, para stereo, mono) for different audio types and at different bit rates to get a good understanding of what bit rates/encoding to use for the different program types.Investigate the delivery of PAD within these tests, synchronisation with the audio and rate of change of the images. In July 2013 over 200 radio industry representatives came together at the South African Broadcasting Corporation’s (SABC) facility in Johannesburg to attend a landmark workshop on the rollout of DAB+ digital radio and to discuss plans for a high-powered DAB+ trial transmission extending from Pretoria to Johannesburg by end 2013. The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA), indicated that it stands ready to support broadcasting innovation in South Africa, which will be the first country to exploit opportunities for delivery of educational services via DAB+, as well as services for those with disabilities. Broadcasting radio via DAB+ will also allow ICASA to license new entrants where FM bandwidth is congested.|$|E
30|$|Studies {{indicate}} that {{a significant proportion of}} data traffic originates indoors [3]. Poor signal reception caused by <b>penetration</b> <b>losses</b> through walls severely hampers the operation of indoor data services in state-of-the-art systems. Recently, the concept of 3 rd generation (3 G) and beyond 3 G (B 3 G) femto-cells, in which HeNBs are placed indoors, has therefore attracted considerable interest. HeNBs are low-cost, low-power, short-range, plug-and-play base stations that are directly connected to the backbone network. HeNBs aim at extending broadband coverage to authorized UEs located indoors where it is most needed [3]. HeNBs therefore offload indoor users from the macro-cell, thus potentially enhancing the capacity both indoors by bypassing wall <b>penetration</b> <b>losses,</b> as well as outdoors by freeing up resources [4, 5]. Moreover, femto-cell deployment could potentially lead to an overall reduced energy consumption as <b>penetration</b> <b>losses</b> due to walls are circumvented [6].|$|R

In response to this, a field study in an unoccupied, single-story residence in Clovis, California has been conducted. Real-time particle monitors were used both outdoors and indoors to quantify PM 2. 5 nitrate, sulfate, and carbon.

Overall, 21 different locations were measured for 6 different materials such that {{the same type of}} material was tested in at least two locations in order to characterize the effect of <b>penetration</b> <b>loss</b> for materials with similar composition. As shown here, attenuation through common materials ranged between 0. 8 dB/cm and 9. 9 dB/cm for co-polarized antennas, while cross-polarized antennas exhibited similar attenuation for most materials, but up to 23. 4 dB/cm of attenuation for others.

30|$|A major {{distinguishing}} {{factor in}} mmWave is the propagation environment. As {{a result of}} the blockage effect associated with mmWave, outdoor mmWave base stations (BSs) are more likely to serve outdoor users since mmWave signals suffer severe <b>penetration</b> <b>losses</b> [10]. Also, it has been revealed via the channel measurement in [1, 8] that blockages result in {{a significant difference between the}} line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) pathloss characteristics. The measurement showed that mmWave signals propagate with pathloss exponent of 2 in LOS paths and a much higher pathloss exponent with additional shadowing in NLOS paths [1, 8]. Furthermore, the NLOS pathloss exponent tends to be more dependent on the scattering environment [11], with typical measured values ranging from 3.2 to 5.8 [1, 8].|$|R

Therefore, a cognitive repeater is implemented as a real-time hardware prototype in an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay and deployed in a real LTE-A testbed.

Future mobile wireless networks call for higher data rate for providing more high quality services and better user experience. Recent studies have suggested that this rapidly increasing demand for high data rate is chiefly generated from indoor environments [1], where exist more than 50 % voice calls and 70 % data traffic [2]. However, indoor radio coverage is generally poor due to the wall <b>penetration</b> <b>losses</b> inside buildings especially when the user is located in the cell edge. This clear discrepancy between high data rate demand and low received signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) leads to many research discussions.
