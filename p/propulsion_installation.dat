Seven propulsion system concepts have been considered to date and comparatively evaluated on a first-order basis using takeoff gross weight (TOGW) as the main discriminator. Only two concepts have been screened out thus far and {{it is apparent that}} TOGW is not a strong discriminator.

Thus, the same series of loading scenarios for an entire range of turning azimuth angles of a twin pod configuration are considered. The approach is rather generic as only nameplate data of the motor drives are required while, as the simulations focus on the electric motors, the rest of the ship electric system considered, including generator sets, is represented by a simplified network. Two different sets of simulations are considered, one comprisng a synchronous ac motor drive and one with an asynchronous motor motor of similar rating.

40|$|A {{trend toward}} {{replacement}} of parametric model testing with parametric {{analysis for the}} design of aircraft is driven by the rapidly escalating cost of wind tunnel testing, the increasing availability of large fast computers, and powerful numerical flow algorithms. In connection with the complex flow phenomena characteristic of propulsion installations, it is now necessary to employ both parametric analysis and testing for design procedures. Powerful flow analysis techniques are available to predict local flow phenomena. However, the employment of these techniques is very expensive. It is, therefore, necessary to link these analyses with less powerful and less expensive procedures for an accurate analysis of <b>propulsion</b> <b>installation</b> flowfields.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{more efficient}} aircraft configurations which have less environmental impact, this paper develops a multidisciplinary analysis framework {{integrated with the}} airframe and propulsion analysis modules. The characteristics for propulsion, aerodynamics, weight, performance, cost, emissions, and noise can be rapidly predicted by the framework. The impact of <b>propulsion</b> <b>installation</b> with large diameter engines on aircraft weight and drag are considered in the framework. A wide-body aircraft was taken as an example for the optimization to investigate the tradeoffs between the cost metric and the environmental performance metrics. Several cases for single objective and multiobjective optimizations were performed. In the single objective optimizations, the direct operating cost, the cumulative noise, the oxides of nitrogen emissions during landing-takeoff cycle, and the mission oxides of nitrogen emissions were considered as an objective and minimized, respectively. The different objectives resulted in designs with different airframe parameters and engine cycle parameters. In the multiobjective optimizations, the direct operating costs and environmental performances were considered as the objectives simultaneously. The optimization results were the Pareto fronts for the minimum direct operating costs and environmental performances, which illustrate the quantitative relationships between the economic metric and the environmental performances...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{operation}} {{cost and}} environmental concerns, there is ongoing {{effort to reduce}} the fuel consumption and emissions in all transportation sectors including marine transportation. In the last decade, the development of diesel electric propulsion system {{have made it possible}} to be installed on many offshore installation vessels. Electric <b>propulsion</b> <b>installation</b> becomes a prevailing trend mainly due to increased demands for energy-efficient and low emission vessels with high availability and reliability. Combining gensets with ESD has shown through different usage strategies to have a potential for improving the fuel economy as well as enhancing the genset dynamics which reduces fuel consumption, emissions, wear and tear, and maintenance cost. This thesis has presented optimization methods to find optimal operating point for gensets under different power demands, with regard to fuel consumption and NOx emission. Three power system configurations for an offshore construction vessel will be explored in this study, 1) marine power plant with large gensets, 2) marine power plant with small gensets which has the same cylinder characteristic with 1), and 3) marine power plant with small gensets which has different cylinder characteristic with 1) and 2). Optimization simulations were accomplished in Matlab. A typical power demand step-wise from 10 % to 100 % MCR has been tested in all configurations, and results have illustrated good fuel economy in configuration 2 over configuration 1. Fuel consumption was also high in configuration 3, however, it was caused by its higher optimum specific fuel consumption feature. Monte Carlo method was applied to test the sensitivity of cost function with slightly varying optimum engine operating points for one case, where it gave consistent fuel consumption and has shown the validity of optimization results. Considering AC/DC converter efficiency degrades especially at low load percentage, a study has shown that fuel efficiency is even better in configuration 2 than one in configuration 1. Multi-objective simulations on configuration 2 was presented with 3 different load condition, 20 %, 45 % and 70 %. It illustrates different shape of pareto front, which is a group of non-dominating optimums. Generally, it showed that {{in order to reduce the}} NOx emission, fuel consumption is required to be compromised. Due to the limitation of accessible specific NOx map, limited case study was accomplished. However, the same optimization method can apply to these maps when it is accessible. Besides, results have indicated by integrating ESD led to fuel consumption by 5. 9 %, 4. 8 % and 6. 7 % in configuration 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Furthermore, configuration 1 has shown a lower fuel consumption by 6. 5 % and 12. 7 % before using ESD, and 4. 9 %, while 10. 9 % after integrating ESD during a certain operational profile. The fuel saving potential was proved to be larger in low-power engine configuration for an assumed offshore construction vessel. The performance of the proposed technique was validated through simulation results, and its advantages were demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Rectangular nozzles are {{increasingly}} used for modern military aircraft <b>propulsion</b> <b>installations,</b> including the roll nozzles on the F- 35 B vertical/short take-off and landing strike fighter. A peculiar {{phenomenon known as}} axis-switching is generally observed in such non-axisymmetric nozzle flows during which the jet spreads faster along the minor axis compared to the major axis. This might affect the under-wing stores and aircraft structure. A computational fluid dynamics study was performed to understand the effects of changing the upstream nozzle geometry on a rectangular free jet. A method is proposed, involving the formulation of an equation based upon a statistical model for a rectangular nozzle with an exit aspect ratio (ARe) of 4; the variables under consideration (for a constant nozzle pressure ratio (NPR)) being inlet aspect ratio (ARi) and length of the contraction section. The jet development was characterised using two parameters: location of the cross-over point (Xc) and {{the difference in the}} jet half-velocity widths along the major and minor axes (ΔB 30).

Many considerations influence the integration, such as structural, aerodynamic, and maintenance factors. In regard to the acoustics of an aircraft, the integration can have significant effects on the net radiated noise.

40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} test program was {{conducted}} to acquire flow-field data during a supersonic propulsion system compressor stall and inlet unstart sequence. The propulsion system consisted of a mixed-compression, two-dimensional bifurcated inlet coupled to a General Electric J 85 - 13 turbojet engine.

Open rotor engines have unique problems relative to turbofans. The rotors are open, exposed to flow conditions outside of the engine. The flow field that the rotors are immersed in may be higher than the free stream flow and it may not be uniform, both of these characteristics could increase noise and decrease performance. The rotors sometimes cause changes in the flow conditions imposed on aircraft surfaces. At high power conditions such as takeoff and climb out, the stream tube of air that goes through the rotors contracts rapidly causing the boundary layer on the body upper surface to go through an adverse pressure gradient which could result with separated airflow. The BWB / Open Rotor configuration must be designed to mitigate these problems...|$|R

40|$|Aircraft noise {{mitigation}} {{is an ongoing}} challenge for the aeronautics research community. In response to this challenge, low-noise aircraft concepts have been developed that exhibit situations where the jet exhaust interacts with an airframe surface. Jet flows interacting with nearby surfaces manifest a complex behavior in which acoustic and aerodynamic characteristics are altered. In this paper, the variation of the aerodynamics, acoustic source, and far-field acoustic intensity are examined as a large at plate is positioned relative to the nozzle exit. Steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes solutions are examined to study the aerodynamic changes in the field-variables and turbulence statistics. The mixing noise model of Tam and Auriault is used to predict the noise produced by the jet. To validate both the aerodynamic and the noise prediction models, results are compared with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and free-field acoustic data respectively. The variation of the aerodynamic quantities and noise source are examined by comparing predictions from various jet and at plate configurations with an isolated jet.

The primary {{objective of the}} study was to determine the {{aircraft system}} level noise given the significant impact of installation effects including shielding the open rotor noise by the airframe. The aircraft was designed to carry a payload of 100, 000 lbs on a 6, 500 nautical mile mission. An experimental database was used to establish the <b>propulsion</b> airframe aeroacoustic <b>installation</b> effects including those from shielding by the airframe planform, interactions with the control surfaces, and additional noise reduction technologies. A second objective of the study applied the impacts of projected low noise airframe technology and a projection of advanced low noise rotors appropriate for the NASA N+ 2 2025 timeframe. With the projection of low noise rotors and installation effects, the aircraft system level was 26. 0 EPNLdB below Stage 4 level with the engine installed at 1. 0 rotor diameters upstream of the trailing edge. Moving the engine to 1. 5 rotor diameters brought the system level noise to 30. 8 EPNLdB below Stage 4. At these locations on the airframe, the integrated level of installation effects including shielding can be as much as 20 EPNLdB cumulative in addition to lower engine source noise from advanced low noise rotors. And finally, an additional set of technology effects were identified and the potential impact at the system level was estimated for noise only without assessing the impact on aircraft performance. If these additional effects were to be included it is estimated that the potential aircraft system noise could reach as low as 38. 0 EPNLdB cumulative below Stage 4...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} performed to study the <b>propulsion</b> airframe aeroacoustic <b>installation</b> effects of a separate flow jet nozzle with a Hybrid Wing Body aircraft configuration where the engine is installed above the wing. Prior understanding of the jet noise shielding effectiveness was extended to a bypass ratio ten application {{as a function of}} nozzle configuration, chevron type, axial spacing, and installation effects from additional airframe components. Chevron types included fan chevrons that are uniform circumferentially around the fan nozzle and T-fan type chevrons that are asymmetrical circumferentially. In isolated testing without a pylon, uniform chevrons compared to T-fan chevrons showed slightly more low frequency reduction offset by more high frequency increase. Phased array localization shows that at this bypass ratio chevrons still move peak jet noise source locations upstream but not to nearly the extent, as a function of frequency, as for lower bypass ratio jets. For baseline nozzles without chevrons, the basic pylon effect has been greatly reduced compared to that seen for lower bypass ratio jets. Compared to Tfan chevrons without a pylon, the combination with a standard pylon results in more high frequency noise increase and an overall higher noise level. Shielded by an airframe surface 2. 17 fan diameters from nozzle to airframe trailing edge, the T-fan chevron nozzle can produce reductions in jet noise of as much as 8 dB at high frequencies and upstream angles. Noise reduction from shielding decreases with decreasing frequency and with increasing angle from the jet inlet. Beyond an angle of 130 degrees there is almost no noise reduction from shielding. Increasing chevron immersion more than what is already an aggressive design is not advantageous for noise reduction. The addition of airframe control surfaces, including vertical stabilizers and elevon deflection, showed only a small overall impact. Based on the test results, the best overall nozzle configuration design was selected for application to the N 2 A Hybrid Wing Body concept that will be the subject of the NASA Langley 14 by 22 Foot Subsonic Tunnel high fidelity aeroacoustic characterization experiment. The best overall nozzle selected includes T-fan type chevrons, uniform chevrons on the core nozzle, and no additional pylon of the type that created a strong acoustic effect at lower bypass ratios. The T-fan chevrons are oriented azimuthally away from the ground observer locations. This best overall nozzle compared to the baseline nozzle was assessed, at equal thrust, to produce sufficient installed noise reduction of the jet noise component to enable the N 2 A HWB to meet NASA s noise goal of 42 dB cumulative below Stage 4...|$|R
