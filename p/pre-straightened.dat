40|$|In this {{investigation}} a DoE (Design of Experiments) analysis of distortion {{for a typical}} manufacturing process of <b>pre-straightened,</b> cold drawn and induction hardened AISI 1045 cylindrical steel bars was carried out. A careful characterization of the material, including residual stress states and geometrical changes, was done for the different manufacturing steps. In order to identify effects and correlations on distortion behavior, the investigated variables included the drawing process itself with two different drawing angles, a stress relief treatment, which was applied to {{one part of the}} samples, and, finally, induction hardening with two different case depths. Main and statistically significant effects on the distortion of the induction hardened samples were found to be in this order, the drawing angle, the stress relief treatment and the induction hardening depth. It was also found that the distortion potentials are transmitted from the drawing process to further manufacturing steps and, consequently, from one production site to the next...|$|E
