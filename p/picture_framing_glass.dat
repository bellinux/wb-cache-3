25|$|Diasec is {{a process}} which uses acrylic glass as a {{substitute}} for normal glass in picture frames. This is done for its relatively low cost, light weight, shatter-resistance, aesthetics and because it can be ordered in larger sizes than standard <b>picture</b> <b>framing</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{pigments}} and dyes absorb UV {{and change}} colour, so paintings and textiles may need extra protection both from sunlight and fluorescent bulbs, two common sources of UV radiation. Window glass absorbs some harmful UV, but valuable artifacts need extra shielding. Many museums place black curtains over watercolour paintings and ancient textiles, for example. Since watercolours can have very low pigment levels, they need extra protection from UV. Various forms of <b>picture</b> <b>framing</b> <b>glass,</b> including acrylics (plexiglass), laminates, and coatings, offer {{different degrees of}} UV (and visible light) protection.|$|E
50|$|The {{picture frame}} may contain a pane of <b>picture</b> <b>framing</b> <b>glass</b> or an acrylic glass {{substitute}} such as acrylite or plexiglas {{to protect the}} picture. In some instances where the art in the frame is dispensable or durable, no protection may be necessary. Glass is common over watercolors and other artwork on paper, but rare over oil paintings, except very valuable ones in some museums. <b>Picture</b> <b>framing</b> <b>glass</b> may be treated with anti-reflective coatings to make the glass virtually invisible under certain lighting conditions. When a picture frame {{is expected to be}} exposed to direct sunlight, or harsh lighting conditions such as fluorescent lights, UV filtering may be added to slow down the photocatalytic degradation of organic materials behind <b>picture</b> <b>framing</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Electrochromic glass {{provides}} visibility even in {{the darkened}} state and thus preserves visible {{contact with the outside}} environment. It has been used in small-scale applications such as rearview mirrors. Electrochromic technology also finds use in indoor applications, for example, for protection of objects under the glass of museum display cases and <b>picture</b> <b>frame</b> <b>glass</b> from the damaging effects of the UV and visible wavelengths of artificial light.Electrochromic glass can be programmed to automatically tint according to the weather or the sun's position or user preferences. It can also be controlled via mobile applications and even via popular voice assistants.|$|R
50|$|Using a {{flatbed scanner}} to scan items other than paper {{documents}} exceeds the original {{purpose of the}} scanner, so special {{care must be taken}} with the process. The bed of the scanner is typically made of glass, and care needs to be taken that the glass not be scratched or cracked when placing or removing items on the bed. Since the items to be captured are often placed directly on the bed, dust and other particles will often land on the glass, and care must be taken to keep the glass clean. Scanners will also hold only a limited amount of weight, and items that may damage the scanner, such a liquids or items that might scratch the glass, should be placed on a plastic barrier to protect the bed. Alternatively, <b>picture</b> <b>frame</b> <b>glass</b> cut a few inches larger than the scanner housing will protect the platen and the device from weeping botanical specimens, paints, melting ice, burning leaves or whatever the challenge.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{widespread}} availability and low cost, Soda Lime Glass is {{most commonly used}} for <b>picture</b> <b>framing</b> <b>glass.</b> Glass thicknesses typically range from thin 2.0 mm, to 2.5 mm. Clear glass has light transmission of ~ 90%, absorption of ~ 2%, and reflection of ~ 8%. Whereas absorption can be reduced by using low-iron glass, reflection can only be reduced by an anti-reflective surface treatment.|$|E
5000|$|In the <b>picture</b> <b>framing</b> industry, {{a fillet}} (also {{referred}} to as a slip) is a small piece of moulding which fits inside a larger frame or, typically, underneath or in between matting, used for decorative purposes. The <b>picture</b> <b>framing</b> term is probably related to, though not necessarily derived from, the engineering term, which it is frequently pronounced similarly to; however, unlike the use of fillets in mechanical engineering, the use of [...] "fillets" [...] in <b>picture</b> <b>frames</b> is wholly decorative.|$|R

5000|$|Indoor lighting, {{especially}} fluorescent lighting, {{is considered}} to contain some UV Light. GELighting.com asserts that [...] "UV exposure from sitting indoors under fluorescent lights at typical office light levels for an eight-hour workday is equivalent to just over one minute {{of exposure to the}} sun in Washington D.C. on a clear day in July. Additionally, the relative damage of incandescent light is 3 times less than that of fluorescent light. Since UV filtering <b>picture</b> <b>framing</b> <b>glass</b> does not protect against all damage factors, it is important to display framed artwork in a well controlled environment to reduce the effects of heat, humidity, and visible light.|$|E
50|$|Light {{transmission}} (for this article, the perceivable {{visible spectrum}} between 390 nm and 750 nm is considered) through glass is diminished either by light reflection or light absorption of the glazing material. The total light transferred through the glazing material (light transmission) {{is reduced by}} reflection and/or absorption. In art framing, light reflection causes glare, while light absorption also may cause the transmitted colors to be dulled or distorted. While type of the glass substrate will affect the light absorption of the glazing, the surface treatment can affect light scattering, light reflection and in some cases, light absorption. There are various glazing options {{to achieve this goal}} as explained in the following sections on Types of <b>Picture</b> <b>Framing</b> <b>Glass.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Picture</b> <b>frames</b> have {{traditionally}} been made of wood, which {{is still the most}} common material, although other materials are used including silver, bronze, aluminum, and plastics such as polystyrene. A <b>picture</b> <b>frame</b> may be of any color or texture, but gilding is common, especially on older wooden <b>frames.</b> Some <b>picture</b> <b>frames</b> have elaborate molding which may relate to the subject matter. Complicated older frames are often made of moulded and gilded plaster over a plain wood base. <b>Picture</b> <b>frames</b> {{come in a variety of}} profiles, but generally the lengths of moulding feature a [...] "lip" [...] and rabbet, the function of which is to allow a space to hold in the materials in the frame. The lip extends usually about a quarter of an inch past the edge of the rabbet.|$|R
