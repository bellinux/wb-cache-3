25|$|Mark L. Strauss, in a <b>paper</b> <b>presented</b> <b>at</b> the 2008 {{annual meeting}} of the Evangelical Theological Society, criticized the ESV for using dated {{language}} and stated it is unsuited for mainstream use. On the other hand, he has defended gender-inclusive language in translation and claims the ESV uses similar gender-inclusive language and speculated that criticism of the ESV by competing Bible translations is contrived for marketing purposes. ESV translator Wayne Grudem has responded that, while on occasion the ESV translates person or one where previous translations used man, it keeps gender-specific language and does not go as far as other translations; the ESV website makes a similar statement. ESV translator William D. Mounce has called these arguments against the ESV ad hominem.|$|E

25|$|Previous {{modifications}} to the original protocols, like False Start (adopted and enabled by Google Chrome) or Snap Start, reportedly introduced limited TLS protocol downgrade attacks or allowed {{modifications to}} the cipher suite list sent by the client to the server.

A <b>paper</b> <b>presented</b> <b>at</b> an Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) conference on computer and communications security in 2012 demonstrated that the False Start extension was at risk: in certain circumstances it could allow an attacker to recover the encryption keys offline and to access the encrypted data.|$|E
