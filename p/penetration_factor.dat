The methane puffs are adjusted to a measurable signal, but global plasma parameters are only weakly affected (line average density, increases by < 10 %, energy confinement time, {tau}{sub E} drops by < 10 %). The total carbon content is derived from C{sup + 6 } density profiles in the core measured {{as a function of}} time using charge exchange recombination spectroscopy.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Much {{of human}} {{exposure}} to ambient ozone and ozone reaction byproducts occurs inside buildings. However, {{there are currently}} no experimental data {{on the ability of}} ozone to penetrate through building envelopes and into residences. This paper presents a method to determine the <b>penetration</b> <b>factor</b> for ozone in buildings, and applies it in an unoccupied test house and seven single-family residences. The mean (±SD) ozone <b>penetration</b> <b>factor</b> was measured as 0. 79 ± 0. 13 in the eight homes using this method, ranging from 0. 62 ± 0. 09 to 1. 02 ± 0. 15. An analysis of tests across the homes revealed that ozone penetration was significantly higher in homes with more painted wood envelope materials, homes with larger air leakage exponents from fan pressurization tests, and older homes. The test method utilizes a large calibrated fan to elevate air exchange rates and steady-state indoor ozone concentrations to levels that can be accurately measured, so there is a potential for overpredicting ozone penetration factors. However, evidence suggests that this bias is likely small in most of the homes, and, even if a bias exists, the measured ozone penetration factors were lower than the usual assumption of unity in seven of the eight tested homes. ■ INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Elevated concentrations of ambient ozone have been associate...|$|E

40|$|Continuous, size {{resolved}} particle {{measurements were}} performed in two houses {{in order to}} determine size-dependent particle penetration and deposition in the indoor environment. The experiments consisted of three parts: (1) measurement of the particle loss rate following artificial elevation of indoor particle concentrations, (2) rapid reduction in particle concentration through induced ventilation by pressurization of the houses with HEPA-filtered air, and (3) measurement of the particle concentration rebound after house pressurization stopped. During the particle concentration decay period, when indoor concentrations are very high, losses due to deposition are large compared to gains due to particle infiltration. During the concentration rebound period, the opposite is true. The large variation in indoor concentration allows the effects of penetration and deposition losses to be separated by the transient, two-parameter model we employed to analyze the data.

40|$|To {{systematically}} describe evaporation spectra {{for light}} and heavy compound nuclei {{over a large}} range of excitation energies, {{it was necessary to}} consider three ingredients in the statistical model. Firstly, transmission coefficients or barrier <b>penetration</b> <b>factors</b> for charged-particle emission are typically taken from global fits to elastic-scattering data. However, such transmission coefficients do not reproduce the barrier region of evaporation spectra and reproduction of the data requires a distributions of Coulomb barriers. This is possibly associated with large fluctuations in the compound-nucleus shape or density profile. Secondly for heavy nuclei, an excitation-energy dependent level-density parameter is required to describe the slope of the exponential tails of these spectra. The level-density parameter was reduced at larger temperatures, consistent with the expected fadeout of long-range correlation, but the strong $A$ dependence of this effect is unexpected. Lastly to describe the angular-momentum dependence of the level density in light nuclei at large spins, the macroscopic rotational energy of the nucleus has to be reduced from the values predicted with the Finite-Range Liquid-Drop model.

Observed rates well below the Coulomb barrier are considerably lower than estimates obtained from <b>penetration</b> <b>factors.</b> One approach in the analysis of the data invokes coupling to non-elastic channels in the scattering as the source of the depletion. Another is to analyze those data in terms of tunneling in semi-classical models, with the observed depletion being taken as evidence of a ``friction'' under the barrier. A complementary approach is to consider such tunneling in terms of a fully quantal model. We investigate tunneling with both one-dimensional and three-dimensional models in a fully quantal approach to investigate possible sources for such a friction. We find that the observed phenomenon may not be explained by friction. However, we find that under certain conditions tunneling may be enhanced or diminished by up to 50 %, which finds analogy with observation, without the invocation of a friction under the barrier.
