Designed for extreme reliability, DD 1 uses quasi-delay-insensitive (QDI) asynchronous logic and contains full-custom radiation-hard memories and logic cells. The chip was found fully functional on first silicon over {{a range of}} operating voltages from near-threshold (500 mV) to above the nominal V_(DD) (1. 1 V). It qualifies as both ultra-low power (<; 100 μW/MHz) and radiation-hard by design. At 550 mV the MCU operates at 1 MIPS with a power consumption of 18 μW/MIPS. At 1. 1 V it runs at 20 MIPS consuming 75 μW/MIPS (1. 5 mW total).

40|$|Detector {{description}} {{is a key}} component of detector design studies, test beam analyses, and most of particle physics experiments that require the simulation of more and more different detector geometries and event types. This <b>paper</b> describes <b>DD</b> 4 hep, which is an easy-to-use yet flexible and powerful detector description framework {{that can be used for}} detector simulation and also extended to specific needs for a particular working environment. Linear collider detector concepts ILD, SiD and CLICdp as well as detector development collaborations CALICE and FCal have chosen to adopt the DD 4 hep geometry framework and its DDG 4 pathway to Geant 4 as its core simulation and reconstruction tools. The DDG 4 plugins suite includes a wide variety of input formats, provides access to the Geant 4 particle gun or general particles source and allows for handling of Monte Carlo truth information, e. g. by linking hits and the primary particle that caused them, which is indispensable for performance and efficiency studies. An extendable array of segmentations and sensitive detectors allows the simulation of a wide variety of detector technologies. This <b>paper</b> shows how <b>DD</b> 4 hep allows to perform complex Geant 4 detector simulations without compiling a single line of additional code by providing a palette of sub-detector components that can be combined and configured via compact XML files. Simulation is controlled either completely via the command line or via simple Python steering files interpreted by a Python executable. It also discusses how additional plugins and extensions can be created to increase the functionality...|$|R

To overcome the drawbacks {{of the constant}} weighting factor adopted in DD, strong robustness of the energy entropy is utilized in DDBSE to identify speech and noise, and then, different αs are assigned to them. DDBSE can do well in adverse environments because the value of α only depends on the information of observations, without using any estimated parameter.|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} routing {{protocols}} [1] {{have been proposed}} for wireless sensor networks in recent years. Considering energy-efficiency as the primary objective, most of routing protocols focus on {{reducing the number of}} packet transmissions by clustering, leveraging geographical information, and so on. These routing protocols in sensor networks have the limitation of lacking application contexts for filtering or aggregation. To remedy this, Directed Diffusion (DD) [2], which utilizes application contexts in data dissemination, is proposed. However, DD cannot support time-sensitive traffic nor perform energy-balancing to increase network lifetime. To bridge this gap, this <b>paper</b> extends <b>DD</b> as follows: (1) real-time (RT) filters to provide better end-to-end (ETE) delay performance for real-time traffic, (2) best-effort (BE) filters to achieve global energy balance and to prolong network lifetime, (3) RT-repairs to fast recover node/link failure for RT traffic. The extended DD is dubbed energy-efficient differentiated directed diffusion (EDDD). Comprehensive simulation experiments show that EDDD has the following advantages: (1) differentiates dissemination service for RT and BE traffic, (2) achieves lower delay for RT traffic than DD, (3) exhibits substantially longer network lifetime than DD...|$|R
40|$|This <b>paper</b> {{introduces}} <b>DD</b> calculus {{and describes}} the basic calculus concepts of derivative and integral {{in a direct}} and non-traditional way, without limit definition: Derivative is computed from the point-slope equation of a tangent line and integral {{is defined as the}} height increment of a curve. This direct approach to calculus has three distinct features: (i) it defines derivative and (definite) integral without using limits, (ii) it defines derivative and antiderivative simultaneously via a derivative-antiderivative (DA) pair, and (iii) it posits the fundamental theorem of calculus as a natural corollary of the definitions of derivative and integral. The first D in DD calculus attributes to Descartes for his method of tangents and the second D to DA-pair. The DD calculus, or simply direct calculus, makes many traditional notations and procedures unnecessary, a plus when introducing calculus to the non-mathematics majors. It has few intermediate procedures, which can help dispel the mystery of calculus as perceived by the general public. The materials in this paper are intended for use in a two-hour introductory lecture on calculus. Comment: 19 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
40|$|Directed Diffusion (DD) is an {{energy-efficient}} {{data dissemination}} scheme {{in order to}} extending the lifetime of the wireless sensor networks. However, original DD is based on shortest path routing, which will deplete quickly the energy of nodes lying along the often used optimal paths. To avoid this, this <b>paper</b> extends <b>DD</b> {{based on the idea}} of energy equivalence. A source routing Directed Diffusion (SR-DD) is proposed in order to avoid local "hotspots" which DD possibly forms. The sink chooses one from several paths based on the residual energy along them. The basic idea behind our routing selecting algorithm is that when all nodes in all possible paths have sufficient residual energy, a path with minimum total transmission energy among these paths is chosen and if all paths have nodes with low energy, max-min residual energy path is chosen, which tries {{to strike a balance between}} the minimum transmission energy and the energy consumption equivalence. The label switching technique is used to route the reinforcement messages to the source, which avoids the overhead of transmitting all nodes identifiers along the path. Simulation results show that SR-DD outperforms DD in uniform energy utilization...|$|R
40|$|This <b>paper</b> {{presents}} <b>DD</b> * Lite, {{an efficient}} incremental search algorithm for {{problems that can}} capitalize on state dominance. Dominance relationships between nodes are used to prune graphs in search algorithms. Thus, exploiting state dominance relationships can considerably speed up search problems in large state spaces, such as mobile robot path planning considering uncertainty, time, or energy constraints. Incremental search techniques are useful when changes can occur in the search graph, such as when re-planning paths for mobile robots in partially known environments. While algorithms such as D * and D * Lite are very efficient incremental search algorithms, they cannot be applied as formulated to search problems in which state dominance is used to prune the graph. DD * Lite extends D * Lite to seamlessly support reasoning about state dominance. It maintains the algorithmic simplicity and incremental search capability of D * Lite, while resulting in orders of magnitude increase in search efficiency in large state spaces with dominance. We illustrate the efficiency of DD * Lite with simulation results from applying the algorithm to a path planning problem with time and energy constraints. We also prove that DD * Lite is sound, complete, optimal, and efficient. Keywords: Search, Dominance, Path-plannin...|$|R
40|$|Frequency domain single-channel speech {{enhancement}} methods are often dened {{in terms of}} the a priori SNR. A widely used method to determine the a priori SNR from noisy speech is the decision directed (DD) approach. An important characteristic of the DD approach is the dependency on previously enhanced frames. This results in biased estimates of the a priori SNR dur-ing speech transitions. To overcome this problem we dene in this <b>paper</b> a forward-backward <b>DD</b> approach that uses a reversed order of frame processing with a user-denable delay. With the forward-backward DD approach increased subjective and objec-tive performances are obtained. Averaged segmental SNR is in-creased with more than 0. 75 dB and 1. 1 dB for speech degraded with white noise at SNRs of 5 dB and 15 dB, respectively. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Maximally linear digital {{differentiators}} (DDs) {{are known}} for high accuracy in narrow frequency bands centered at the frequency {{for which they are}} designed. In this <b>paper,</b> designs of <b>DDs</b> of odd and even lengths having maximal linearity at the middle of the frequency band are presented. Applying the maximal linearity constraints to the magnitude response of a differentiator gives a system of linear equations, which can be solved for the impulse response coefficients of the differentiator. It is observed that the coefficient matrices of these equations are Vandermonde matrices, and this helps in finding the solution of the equations in closed form. Design examples are presented to show the accuracy of the presented designs, and it is observed that even-length designs are more accurate in a significantly wider frequency band as compared with odd-length designs.

40|$|Abstract. The {{abstract}} syntax of a graphical modeling language is typically defined with a metamodel while its concrete syntax (diagram) is informally defined with text and figures. Recently, the Object Management Group (OMG) released a beta specification, called Diagram Definition (DD), to formally define both the interchange syntax and the graphical syntax of diagrams. In this <b>paper,</b> we validate <b>DD</b> by {{using it to}} define {{a subset of the}} UML class diagram. Specifically, we define the interchange syntax with a MOF-based metamodel and the graphical syntax with a QVT mapping to a graphics metamodel. We then run an experiment where we interchange and render an example diagram. We highlight various design decisions and discuss challenges of using DD in practice. Finally, we conclude that DD is a sound approach for formally defining diagrams that is expected to facilitate the interchange and the consistent rendering of diagrams between tools...|$|R
40|$|The {{principles}} of the Double Difference (DD) method, applied to the neutron spectrometer VESUVIO, are discussed. VESUVIO, an inverse geometry spectrometer operating at the ISIS pulsed neutron source in the eV energy region, has been specifically designed to measure the single particle dynamical properties in condensed matter. The width of the nuclear resonance of the absorbing filter, used for the neutron energy analysis, provides the most important contribution to the energy resolution of the inverse geometry instruments. In this <b>paper,</b> the <b>DD</b> method, {{which is based on}} a linear combination of two measurements recorded with filter foils of the same resonance material but of different thickness, is shown to improve significantly the instrumental energy resolution, as compared with the Single Difference (SD) method. The asymptotic response functions, derived through Monte-Carlo simulations for polycrystalline Pb and ZrH 2 samples, are analysed in both DD and SD methods, and compared with the experimental ones for Pb sample. The response functions have been modelled for two distinct experimental configurations of the VESUVIO spectrometer, employing Li- 6 -glass neutron detectors and NaI gamma detectors revealing the gamma-ray cascade from the (n, gamma) reaction, respectively. The DD method appears to be an effective experimental procedure for Deep Inelastic Neutron Scattering measurements on VESUVIO spectrometer, since it reduces the experimental resolution of the instrument in both Li- 6 -glass neutron detector and gamma detector configurations.

40|$|Objective: The aims of {{this thesis}} were to {{evaluate}} the influence of ethnicity and other sociodemographic factors on the rate of diverticular disease (<b>DD)</b> (<b>Paper</b> I), to compare findings specific for DD and acceptance of CT Colonography (CTC) and conventional Colonoscopy (CC) in patients examined after diverticulitis (AD) (Paper II), {{to evaluate the}} value of antibiotics in conservative treatment of patients with mild AD (Paper III) and to study patients with diverticular fistulas to the female genital tract (Paper IV). Methods: In paper I, Swedish national registers with information about health and socio-demographic indicators were used to study ethnicity and other socio-demographic factors {{and the risk of}} hospital admission due to DD in a national cohort (4. 4 millions) followed prospectively over a period of ten years. Paper II was a prospective comparative study of 57 patients examined with CTC and CC respectively. Paper III was an observational study of 311 patients; all treated for AD and included mailed questionnaires. Paper IV reviewed evaluation, management, morbidity and outcome in 60 women treated for DD fistulas to the genital tract. Results: In all 25, 123 patients were hospitalized because of DD during 1991 - 2000. The risk ratio (RR) of DD, after adjustment for age, sex and socio-economic indicators, was lower in non-western immigrants (RRs 0. 5 - 0. 7) compared with indigenous patients. The risk increased with time after settlement in Sweden. Women had a higher risk compared with men (R-R 1. 50, CI 95 % 1. 46 - 1. 54, p< 0. 001) and the difference increased with age. (<b>Paper</b> I) <b>DD</b> was found in 96 % of patients at CTC and in 90 % at colonoscopy. Eight suspected polyps sized ¡Ý 5 mm were found in six patients. Patients experienced colonoscopy more discomforting (p< 0. 03), painful (p< 0. 001) and difficult (p< 0. 01) than CTC Seventyfour % of patients preferred CTC. (Paper II) During first hospitalisation, patients treated with antibiotics had a more pronounced inflammation compared with patients treated without antibiotics. If initially treated with antibiotics three patients (3 %) failed to respond to medical management and had surgery. Seven patients (4 %) treated without antibiotics failed to respond and antibiotics were then added. In all, 29 % of patients treated with antibiotics had further events (recurrent AD and/or subsequent surgery) during EU (mean 30 months, range 16 - 45), compared with 28 % (N. S.), if treated without antibiotics. In a multivariate analysis, antibiotics did not influence the risk for a further event (OR 1. 03, Cl 95 % 0. 61 - 1. 74). (Paper III) The most common presenting symptoms in women with a DD fistula to the genital tract were vaginal discharge of faeces or gas (95 %) and 75 % of them had previously had a hysterectomy. 57 / 60 patients had surgery, sigmoid resection and anastomosis was performed in 51 and a Hartmann's procedure with colostomy in six patients. In all, 26 % of the patients experienced morbidity after surgery, including anastomotic dehiscence (n= 4) and ureteric injury (n= 3). All operated patients were cured from their fistulas and outcome was satisfactory in 86 %. (<b>Paper</b> IV) Conclusions: <b>DD</b> appears to be an acquired disorder and acculturation to a Western lifestyle has an impact on the risk for DD. Potential socio-demographic confounders, such as socio-economic status, residency and housing situation don't influence the risk. The diagnostic findings of CTC are comparable to colonoscopy in patients investigated after AD. CTC is less discomforting and preferred by a majority of patients. Thus, CTC seems to be a good alter-native in the follow-up of patients after AD. To omit antibiotics in the treatment of mild AD appears safe and does not influence the rate of further events. DD fistulas to the female genital tract mostly occur in elderly patients with a prior hysterectomy. Sigmoid resection and primary anastomosis is done safely in the majority of patients...|$|R
30|$|In most instances, {{especially}} to those voiced frames, {{the energy of}} speech sparser than noise, namely the absolute of DFT coefficients of noise (except periodic noise) (This paper takes no account of periodic noise.), is more balanced {{than that of the}} speech because those voiced frames are quasi-periodic in time domain and robust in noisy environments [21]. Therefore, according to the characteristics of entropy, the energy of the R continuous frames in each frequency point also follows: when speech appears in some of the R continuous frames, the entropy always becomes smaller than that in the case where all of the R continuous frames are noise frame. Therefore, it is reasonable to track the speech via the change of entropy. So in this <b>paper,</b> a modified <b>DD</b> approach based on the change of entropy (DDBSE) is proposed for a priori SNR estimation. Moreover, considering the importance of noise estimation for speech enhancement, a noise estimation approach based on unbiased MMSE and VAD (UMVAD) is presented.|$|R
40|$|Difference in {{differences}} (DD) is {{a popular}} way of finding treatment effects with observational data. DD relies on the key identifying condition that the untreated response variable would have grown equally across the control and treatment groups (i. e., the time effects across the groups is the same). This key condition can be rewritten as the group effects across the time points being the same, with which this <b>paper</b> generalizes <b>DD</b> to difference in generalized-differences (DG). DG is indexed by a parameter η, and includes DD as a special case when η = 1. This feature {{makes it possible to}} use DG as a sensitivity analysis for DD by trying values of η other than one. Going further from sensitivity analysis, one may desire to fix the value of η. For this, we provide a way to get a benchmark value of η using a dynamic panel data model for the control group. An empirical analysis is provided for the effects of moving from private to public school on various test scores. In the empirical analysis, (i) DD magnitude is fairly sensitive to changes in η around one, but its statistical significance is not, (ii) η is significantly smaller than one in math score (and possibly in science score), and (iii) DG yields a significant negative effect of about 3 - 5 % for reading score, but the effects are ambiguous or insignificant for the other scores. η being less than 1 means that, had the movers to public school stayed, the score gap between the movers and stayers would have narrowed. That is, the move to public school is likely to have been involuntary. Key Words: treatment effect, difference in differences, panel data, private-school effect. * The author is grateful to the Editor, Associate Editor, two reviewers for their detailed comments which led to a substantial improvement of the paper.

40|$|Most Difference-in-Difference (<b>DD)</b> <b>papers</b> rely on {{many years}} of data and focus on {{serially}} correlated outcomes. Yet almost all these papers ignore the bias in the estimated standard errors that serial correlation introduce 4 s. This is especially troubling because the independent variable of interest in DD estimation (e. g., the passage of law) is itself very serially correlated, which will exacerbate the bias in standard errors. To illustrate the severity of this issue, we randomly generate placebo laws in state-level data on female wages from the Current Population Survey. For each law, we use OLS to compute the DD estimate of its 'effect' {{as well as the}} standard error for this estimate. The standard errors are severely biased: with about 20 years of data, DD estimation finds an 'effect' significant at the 5 % level of up to 45 % of the placebo laws. Two very simple techniques can solve this problem for large sample sizes. The first technique consists in collapsing the data and ignoring the time-series variation altogether; the second technique is to estimate standard errors while allowing for an arbitrary covariance structure between time periods. We also suggest a third technique, based on randomization inference testing methods, which works well irrespective of sample size. This technique uses the empirical distribution of estimated effects for placebo laws to form the test distribution. ...|$|R
40|$|Ouyed et al. (1998) {{proposed}} Deuterium (DD) fusion at the core-mantle interface {{of giant}} planets {{as a mechanism}} to explain their observed heat excess. But rather high interior temperatures (10 ^ 5 K) and a stratified D layer are needed, making such a scenario unlikely. In this <b>paper,</b> we re-examine <b>DD</b> fusion, {{with the addition of}} screening effects pertinent to a deuterated core containing ice and some heavy elements. This alleviates the extreme temperature constraint and removes the requirement of a stratified D layer. As an application, we propose that, if their core temperatures are a few times 10 ^ 4 K and core composition is chemically inhomogeneous, the observed inflated size of some giant exoplanets ("hot Jupiters") may be linked to screened DD fusion occurring deep in the interior. Application of an analytic evolution model suggests that the amount of inflation from this effect can be important if there is sufficient rock-ice in the core, making DD fusion an effective extra internal energy source for radius inflation. The mechanism of screened DD fusion, operating in the above temperature range, is generally consistent with the trend in radius anomaly with planetary equilibrium temperature T_ eq, and also depends on planetary mass. Although we do not consider the effect of incident stellar flux, we expect that a minimum level of irradiation is necessary to trigger core erosion and subsequent DD fusion inside the planet. Since DD fusion is quite sensitive to the screening potential inferred from laboratory experiments, observations of inflated hot Jupiters may help constrain screening effects in the cores of giant planets.

40|$|We {{showed that}} a well {{established}} epidemic in rural Bangladesh represented a low rate of recent transmission. A majority of the strains belonged to the ancient East African- Indian (EAI) lineage (Paper I). Our {{study found that the}} total resistance among new cases to any drug was 31 %, 2 % were MDR. The NTP in Sunamganj is still effective, although the high resistance to INH is alarming (Paper II), and DST services were possible and highly needed. Due to the low rate of transmission in the high-incidence area, it was likely that most patients had been infected a long time ago. We thus wanted to measure the impact DD could have in similar high incidence settings (Paper IV). In order to study the impact of DD, an introductory review of published studies describing DD in numerous countries was conducted (Paper III). We found the core problem in DD to be a vicious cycle of repeated visits at the same healthcare level, resulting in non-specific antibiotic treatment and failure to access specialized TB services. To reduce the DD there is an urgent need for alternative means to monitor the epidemic at the local level. We found that a systematic registration of treatment delay in the TB program records of the Amhara Region of Ethiopia could be utilized to estimate the infectious pool of TB. By recording the treatment delay for new TB cases, retreatment cases and failures, and by estimating the number of undiagnosed cases, the total number of infectious days and, hence, an estimate of the infectious pool could be calculated (<b>Paper</b> IV). Since <b>DD</b> was considerable in the high-incidence setting we wanted to compare to risk-groups in developed countries with a low-rate of TB (Paper V). Health care workers exposed to TB at three Norwegian hospitals as well as a non-exposed control group were tested with both TST and the INF-ã test T-SPOT. TB. Our data indicate that the frequency of latent TB in the total cohort of HCWs is 3 % whereas the rate of transmission of TB to exposed individuals is around 2 % and occurs through short time exposure.
