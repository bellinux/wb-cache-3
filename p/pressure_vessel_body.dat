40|$|Burst disks, {{commonly}} used in pressure relief applications, were studied as single-use valves. A dual-burst disk design was chosen for primary investigation for systems involving separation of gases of two significantly different pressures. The two disks are used to seal either end of a piston cavity that has a different cross-sectional area on each side. Different piston surface areas are used to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium, P{sub 1 }A{sub 1 } = P{sub 2 }A{sub 2 }. The single-use valve functions when the downstream pressure is reduced to approximately atmospheric pressure, creating a pressure differential that causes the burst disks to fail. Several parameters were studied to determine the optimum design of the burst disk. These parameters include thickness, diameter, area/pressure ratio, scoring, and disk geometry. The disk material was limited to 304 L stainless steel. Factors that were considered essential to the optimization of the design were robustness, manufacturability, and burst pressure variability. The thicknesses of the disks that were studied range from 0. 003 in. to 0. 010 in. A model for predicting burst pressures of the burst disks was derived. The model combines membrane stress theory with force/displacement data to predict the burst pressure of various designs to within {+-} 10 %. This model results from studies that characterize the behavior of individual small and large disks. Welding techniques used to join the dual-disk assembly are discussed. Laser welds are used to join and seal the disks to the bulkhead. These welds were optimized for repeatability and robustness. Resistance upset welding is suggested for joining the dual-disk assembly to the <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>body.</b> Resistance upset weld parameters were developed for this particular design so as to minimize the side effects on the burst-disk performance and to provide high-quality welds...|$|E
40|$|High-temperature gas-cooled {{reactors}} (HTGR) are passively safe, efficient, {{and economical}} {{solutions to the}} world??s energy crisis. HTGRs are capable of generating high temperatures during normal operation, introducing design challenges related to material selection and reactor safety. Understanding heat transfer and fluid flow phenomena during normal and transient operation of HTGRs is essential to ensure the adequacy of safety features, such as the reactor cavity cooling system (RCCS). Modeling abilities of system analysis codes, used to {{develop an understanding of}} light water reactor phenomenology, need to be proven for HTGRs. RELAP 5 - 3 D v 2. 3. 6 is used to generate two reactor plant models for a code-to-code and a code-to-experiment benchmark problem. The code-to-code benchmark problem models the Russian VGM reactor for pressurized and depressurized pressure vessel conditions. Temperature profiles corresponding to each condition are assigned to the pressure vessel heat structure. Experiment objectives are to calculate total thermal energy transferred to the RCCS for both cases. Qualitatively, RELAP 5 - 3 D??s predictions agree closely with those of other system codes such as MORECA and Thermix. RELAP 5 - 3 D predicts that 80 % of thermal energy transferred to the RCCS is radiant. Quantitatively, RELAP 5 - 3 D computes slightly higher radiant and convective heat transfer rates than other system analysis codes. Differences in convective heat transfer rate arise from the type and usage of convection models. Differences in radiant heat transfer stem from the calculation of radiation shape factors, also known as view or configuration factors. A MATLAB script employs a set of radiation shape factor correlations and applies them to the RELAP 5 - 3 D model. This same script is used to generate radiation shape factors for the code-toexperiment benchmark problem, which uses the Japanese HTTR reactor to determine temperature along the outside of the pressure vessel. Despite lacking information on material properties, emissivities, and initial conditions, RELAP 5 - 3 D temperature trend predictions closely match those of other system codes. Compared to experimental measurements, however, RELAP 5 - 3 D cannot capture fluid behavior above the pressure vessel. While qualitatively agreeing over the <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>body,</b> RELAP 5 - 3 D predictions diverge from experimental measurements elsewhere. This difference reflects the limitations of using a system analysis code where computational fluid dynamics codes are better suited...|$|E
40|$|Evaluation of {{localized}} peak strains at {{stress concentration}} zones under transient thermal loading {{is essential for}} the determination of low cycle fatigue life of a number of <b>pressure</b> <b>vessels</b> like steam turbine components and reactor vessels. Finite element analysis is a powerful technique but there are some difficulties in using the method for inelastic analysis of large-sized components. Several investigators have proposed approximate methods to determine inelastic strains at notches and other stress concentration zones from elastically calculated stress distributions. The accuracy of three of these methods, namely the Neuber rule, the Molski-Glinka rule and GLOSS analysis under thermal loading for axisymmetric <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>bodies</b> was investigated. A parametric study with geometry and material parameters as variables was carried out for three sizes of spheres with nozzles for the determination of peak strains and stresses under transient thermal loading using thermoelastoplastic finite element analyses and also by approximate methods. The same analyses have also been carried out for a steam turbine valve body for the same thermal loading, which is normally encountered by the valve body under start-up conditions. It has been found that GLOSS analysis is more accurate and the use of approximate methods has been recommended, especially for preliminary analyses in the development of new components.

These conditions affect hydrodynamic forces {{acting on the}} vessel and in consequence they affect their operation. There are several hydrodynamic effects present in {{inland waterways}}.
