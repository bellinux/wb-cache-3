5|$|For {{internal}} broaching {{the sides of}} the broach are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for external broaching the sides are drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the broach from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the work piece rotates, the broach is pressed against it, is driven by it, and rotates synchronously with it. If the tool holder rotates, the broach is <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> workpiece, but is driven by the tool holder.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{is similar}} in shape to that of M.mystacinus and M.brandtii, but the front part of the braincase is higher. The second and third upper premolars (P2 and P3) are tiny and <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> upper canine (C1) and fourth premolar (P4). The canine is less {{well-developed}} than in M.mystacinus. There is a clear cusp present {{on the side of}} the P4. The accessory cusp known as the protoconule is present on each of the upper molars when they are unworn. M.mystacinus lacks the P4 cusp and the protoconules on the molars, but M.brandtii has an even larger cusp on P4.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocus had an {{extremely}} long tail, composed of about 80 caudal vertebrae, which are {{almost double the}} number some of the earlier sauropods had in their tails (such as Shunosaurus with 43), and far more than contemporaneous macronarians had (such as Camarasaurus with 53). Some speculation exists {{as to whether it}} may have had a defensive or noisemaking (by cracking it like a coachwhip) function. The tail may have served as a counterbalance for the neck. The middle part of the tail had 'double beams' (oddly shaped chevron bones on the underside, which gave Diplodocus its name). They may have provided support for the vertebrae, or perhaps prevented the blood vessels from being crushed if the animal's heavy tail <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> ground. These 'double beams' are also seen in some related dinosaurs.|$|E

50|$|Several tactile illusions {{are caused}} by dynamic {{stimulus}} sequences that <b>press</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> stationary skin surface.|$|R
5000|$|These {{headaches}} can {{be brought}} on by such innocuous sources as wearing a halter top (<b>presses</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> neck), earplugs (<b>presses</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> jaw and inner ear), or wearing even a tiny hair clip (compresses the scalp). There is no known preventative treatment except to avoid the offending trigger. However, once symptoms arise and the trigger is removed, [...] "Triptan"-type migraine treatment is effective.|$|R
5|$|Mating is {{initiated}} when {{up to five}} males follow closely {{behind a}} female and bite at her fins and body, possibly cued by pheromones indicating the female's readiness. Each male attempts to seize the female by engulfing one of her pectoral fins; at times two males might grasp a female on both sides simultaneously. Once engaged, the sharks sink to the bottom, whereupon the male (or males) rotates one of his claspers forward, inflates the associated siphon sac (a subcutaneous abdominal organ that takes in seawater {{that is used to}} flush sperm into the female), and attempts to make contact with the female's vent. In many cases, the female resists by pressing her belly against the bottom and arching her tail; this may reflect mate choice on her part. The male has a limited time in which to achieve copulation, as while he is holding the female's pectoral fin in his mouth he is being deprived of oxygen. On the other hand, if the female is willing, the pair settles side-by-side with their heads <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bottom and their bodies at an upward angle.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouthpiece}} {{and reed}} {{are surrounded by}} the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on the reed and form an airtight seal. Air is blown past the reed and down the instrument. In {{the same way a}} flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past the reed causes it to vibrate. As air pressure from the mouth increases, the amount the reed vibrates increases until the reed hits the mouthpiece. At this point the reed stays <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> mouthpiece until either the springiness of the reed forces it to open or a returning pressure wave 'bumps' into the reed and opens it. Each time the reed opens, a puff of air goes through the gap, after which the reed swings shut again. When played loudly, the reed can spend up to 50% of the time shut. The 'puff of air' or compression wave (around 3% greater pressure than the surrounding air) travels down the cylindrical tube and escapes {{at the point where the}} tube opens out. This is either at the closest open hole or at the end of the tube (see diagram: image 1).|$|E
5|$|The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers on {{the upper}} lips) reach {{the tips of the}} ears when <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> head. The short, rounded ears {{themselves}} are naked on the inside, but covered with short brown hairs on the outer surface. Females have three pairs of mammae. The digits and metapodials are mostly covered by white hairs. Short ungual tufts of hairs surrounding the bases of the claws are present. There are five pads on the forefeet and six on the hindfeet. On the hindfeet, the fifth digit is nearly as long as the middle three and the first (the hallux) is much shorter. The tail is longer than the head and body and appears naked for most of its length, but fine hairs are visible near the tip. Although the lower side is slightly lighter, there is no clear difference in coloration between the upper and lower sides. The skin of the tail is gray, and it is covered lightly by fine hairs that are dark brown over most of the length of the tail, but white near the tip.|$|E
50|$|Henry {{settled on}} a farm in {{northern}} Vermont, and also studied law. Here he remained five years studying law and, occasionally, writing articles for <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> republican form of government.|$|R
50|$|The Westwood pattern rim {{was one of}} {{the first}} rim designs, and rod-actuated brakes, which <b>press</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> inside surface of the rim were {{designed}} for this rim. These rims cannot be used with caliper rim brakes.|$|R
50|$|A {{drum brake}} is a vehicle brake {{in which the}} {{friction}} {{is caused by a}} set of brake shoes that <b>press</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> inner surface of a rotating drum. The drum is connected to the rotating roadwheel hub.|$|R
25|$|A useful way of {{analyzing}} solid samples {{without the need}} for cutting samples uses ATR or attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy. Using this approach, samples are <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> face of a single crystal. The infrared radiation passes through the crystal and only interacts with the sample at the interface between the two materials.|$|E
25|$|Wooden {{brake blocks}} between the wheels that are <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> track when the gripman pulls a lever, {{bringing}} {{the car to}} a halt. The four blocks are made of Douglas fir (pine) and can produce a smell of burning wood when in operation. They {{have to be replaced}} after just a few days.|$|E
25|$|The Stun Gun {{comes in}} several voltage options ranging from 2.5 Million to 4.5 Million volts, giving the {{opportunity}} to choose how strong the user wants the shock to be. Depending on the voltage {{and the length of}} time the device is <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> attacker, the effects can last several for several minutes, up to half an hour.|$|E
50|$|The head may {{be pulled}} back in some way, such as in head bondage. However, some purists argue that this goes <b>against</b> <b>the</b> idea of binding into a ball. Alternatively, the head can be pulled forward to force <b>the</b> chin to <b>press</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> chest.|$|R
5000|$|The Tarphyceratidae are tightly coiled, evolute Tarphycerida with ventral siphuncles. The dorsum is {{characteristically}} impressed where <b>the</b> whorl <b>presses</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> venter of the previous. The Tarphyceratidae {{are derived}} from Bassleroceras or possibly from some member of the Estonioceratidae.|$|R

25|$|In some instances, images or designs can be {{transferred}} to metal surfaces via mechanical process. One such process is roll stamping or roller-die engraving. In this process, a hardened image die is <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> destination surface using extreme pressure to impart the image. In the 1800s pistol cylinders were often decorated via this process to impart a continuous scene around its surface.|$|E
25|$|The tibia of {{each leg}} bears a single tibial spur. The tarsal claws are double and unequal, with one weak, slender claw <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> larger, {{stronger}} claw. The claws of the hind legs are particularly large. In males the hind legs {{are also more}} strongly developed than in females, swollen and more robust through the femora, tibiae, and tarsi.|$|E
25|$|When {{actively}} fishing, the angler {{may want}} to keep the fly line lightly <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> rod handle with the index finger of the casting arm. The free arm is used to pull line from the reel or to retrieve line from the water. If a fish strikes, the angler can pinch the line with the index finger against the rod handle and lift the rod tip, setting the hook.|$|E
50|$|Lug, lateen and settee sails have an {{efficient}} tack and an inefficient tack, in which <b>the</b> sail <b>presses</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> mast, spoiling its aerodynamics. Some swing their yards around the mast to make both tacks efficient, {{but this is}} difficult with larger sails.|$|R

50|$|In each case, {{to print}} a line, {{precisely}} timed hammers strike <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{back of the}} paper at the exact moment that the correct character to be printed is passing {{in front of the}} paper. <b>The</b> paper <b>presses</b> forward <b>against</b> a ribbon which then <b>presses</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> character form and the impression of the character form is printed onto the paper.|$|R
25|$|Another ancient {{method of}} holding the work is the hold fast or {{holdfast}}. A holdfast looks like a shepherd's crook. The shank goes into {{a hole in the}} bench top and the tip of the hook is <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> work from above. The holdfast is set by rapping the top with a mallet, and released by hitting the back side. A good holdfast works remarkably well, and is inexpensive and easy to install.|$|E
25|$|Karl Drais {{included}} a pivoting brake shoe {{that could be}} <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> rear iron tyre of his 1817 Laufmaschine. This was continued on the earliest bicycles with pedals, such as the boneshaker, which were fitted with a spoon brake to press onto the rear wheel. The brake was operated by a lever or by a cord connecting to the handlebars. The rider could also slow down by resisting the pedals of the fixed wheel drive.|$|E
25|$|The {{antennae}} {{always have}} two grooves on the underside; {{the club is}} variable in shape. Throughout the family, the front pair of legs in the male, and with three exceptions (Libythea, Pseudergolis, and Calinaga) in the female also, is reduced in size and functionally impotent; in some, the atrophy of the forelegs is considerable, e.g., the Danainae and Satyrinae. In many of the forms of these subfamilies, the forelegs are kept <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> underside of the thorax, and are in the male often very inconspicuous.|$|E
25|$|However, inward-hinged doors {{can also}} {{escalate}} an accident by preventing people from escaping the building: people inside <b>the</b> building may <b>press</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> doors, and thus prevent the doors from opening. This was partly {{the case in}} the Grue Church fire in Norway in 1822.|$|R
25|$|While at Grenoble, Bishop Ginoulhiac {{wrote and}} {{published}} several letters and pastorals, {{especially on the}} condition of the Pontifical States (1860), on Ernest Renan's Life of Jesus (1863) and on the accusations of <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Encyclical of 8 December 1864 and the Syllabus (1865).|$|R
50|$|The trigger {{should be}} pulled with the {{forefinger}}. If the trigger is pulled {{with the second}} finger, the forefinger extending {{along the side of}} the receiver is apt to <b>press</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> projecting pin of the slide stop and cause a jam when the slide recoils.|$|R
25|$|Other {{anomalies}} of {{the classic}} Potter sequence infant include a parrot beak nose, redundant skin, and the most common characteristic of infants with BRA which is a skin fold of tissue extending from the medial canthus across the cheek. The ears are slightly low and <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> head making them appear large. The adrenal glands often appear as small oval discs <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> posterior abdomen due {{to the absence of}} upward renal pressure. The bladder is often small, nondistensible and may be filled with a minute amount of fluid. In males the vas deferens and seminal vesicles may be absent, while in females the uterus and upper vagina may be absent. Other abnormalities include anal atresia, absence of the rectum and sigmoid colon, esophageal and duodenal atresia, and a single umbilical artery. Presence of a diaphragmatic hernia is also common in these fetuses/infants. Additionally, the alveolar sacs of the lungs fail to properly develop {{as a result of the}} reduced volume of amniotic fluid. Labor is often induced between 22 and 36 weeks of gestation (however, some of these pregnancies may go to term) and unaborted infants typically survive for only a few minutes to a few hours. These infants will eventually die as either a result of pulmonary hypoplasia or renal failure.|$|E
25|$|Conversion to an AGT {{system was}} {{relatively}} straightforward. The steel wheels were replaced with rubber ones, which ran {{in a narrow}} concrete guideway structure instead of the I-beam rails. The guideway was roughly {{the size and shape}} of a pedestrian sidewalk, with short vertical extension on either side to form a U-shape. Small horizontal wheels at the front of the cars <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> vertical sections and guided the main wheels around corners. Power was provided via a third rail system attached to the top of the right vertical extension (as seen in the direction of travel).|$|E
25|$|In reptiles, {{sound is}} {{transmitted}} to the inner ear by the stapes (stirrup) bone of the middle ear. This is <b>pressed</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> oval window, a membrane-covered opening {{on the surface of}} the vestibule. From here, sound waves are conducted through a short perilymphatic duct to a second opening, the round window, which equalizes pressure, allowing the incompressible fluid to move freely. Running parallel with the perilymphatic duct is a separate blind-ending duct, the lagena, filled with endolymph. The lagena is separated from the perilymphatic duct by a basilar membrane, and contains the sensory hair cells that finally translate the vibrations in the fluid into nerve signals. It is attached at one end to the saccule.|$|E

5000|$|However, by {{the time}} {{fighting}} started again in early December 1961, a lively campaign had been launched in <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> military acts and methods of the UN, causing Kennedy to adopt a more peaceful strategy of 'quiet diplomacy' [...] and to support cease-fire demands.|$|R
2500|$|Hudal was {{particularly}} close to von Papen, who as the Reich's ambassador in Vienna prepared the German-Austrian agreement of 11 July 1936, which some claim {{paved the way}} for the Anschluss. This agreement was backed by Hudal in <b>the</b> Austrian <b>press,</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> position of several Austrian Bishops.|$|R
