5|$|Alastair Campbell was the Labour Party's <b>Press</b> Secretary and led a {{strategy}} to neutralise {{the influence of the}} <b>press</b> (which had weakened former Labour leader Neil Kinnock) and create allies for the party.

He was a valued news source for journalists because he was close to Blairâ€“ he was the first <b>press</b> secretary to regularly attend cabinet meetings.|$|E

In addition to this political coverage, the network broadcasts <b>press</b> conferences and meetings of various news media and nonprofit organizations, including those at the National <b>Press</b> Club, public policy seminars and the White House Correspondents' Dinner. While C-SPAN does not have video access to the Supreme Court, the network has used the Court's audio recordings accompanied by still photographs of the justices and lawyers to cover the Court in session on significant cases, and has covered individual Supreme Court justices' speaking engagements.|$|E
