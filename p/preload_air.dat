5000|$|Furthermore, {{there are}} also air {{bearings}} with integrated vacuum or magnetic <b>preloads,</b> <b>air</b> bearings for high temperatures with more than 400 °C, as well as ones manufactured with alternative materials.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A small scale, high {{precision}} co-ordinate table was developed {{as part of}} a project to solve measurement problems originating from microtechnic. Construction with a single reference surface was selected and vacuum <b>preloaded</b> <b>air</b> bearing applied in order to enable smooth motion and eliminate stick slip. Laser interferometers were applied to measure both the displacement and the angular error. The paper describes the mathematical evaluation of the measuring system’s error and how that is taken into account in the evaluation software...|$|R
50|$|The XV920R had {{a unique}} {{enclosed}} chain final drive, a large, 8 in headlamp, a high-capacity sculpted fuel tank, and rear-set controls and footpegs. Like the Virago, {{it had a}} stamped-steel backbone frame, also serving {{as part of the}} air-induction system. It had a mono-shock rear suspension, with (<b>air)</b> <b>preload</b> and damper adjustments. The front suspension had <b>air</b> <b>preload</b> adjustment only.|$|R
40|$|Considerations and {{approaches}} to the ground testing of large space structures are discussed. The large size combined with the loading due to gravity makes testing of the complete structure difficult. Gravitational stiffening, suspension effects, virtual <b>air</b> mass, <b>preloads,</b> and <b>air</b> damping alter the dynamic characteristics. Low resonant frequencies and high modal densities within the frequency range of interest combine with small motions and accelerations to make testing difficult. Mechanism complexities and nonlinearities associated with space-erected/assembled structures cause structural complexity regardless of other considerations. Ground test approaches include scale models, element and substructure tests, and structural linearization. Analytical approaches are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|Beside the performance, the {{reliability}} {{is extremely important}} for a production machine. The air-guided solution {{is designed to be}} statically determined. The iron-core linear motor and piston bearings achieve the <b>preload</b> for the <b>air</b> bearings. Thereby, the drive is easy to assemble and insensitive against geometric variations, for instance through temperature influences or the disposition of the machines.|$|R
40|$|Cyclic-load {{crack growth}} {{measurements}} {{were performed on}} ASME SA- 105 Grade 2 steel specimens exposed to 10, 000 - and 15, 000 -psi hydrogen and to 5000 -psi helium, all at ambient temperatures. The cyclic-load crack growth rate {{was found to be}} faster in high-pressure hydrogen than in helium. Cyclic-load crack growth rates in this steel were not reduced by <b>preloading</b> in <b>air</b> to a stress intensity of 1. 5 times the cyclic K sub max in hydrogen. There are indications that holding under load in hydrogen, and loading and unloading in helium retards hydrogen-accelerated cyclic-load crack growth. Cyclic frequency and R (ratio of K sub min/k sub max) were important variables determining crack growth rate. The crack growth rate increased as a logarithm of the cycle duration and decreased with increasing R...|$|R
50|$|The drive {{package on}} the Venture Royale {{includes}} a liquid-cooled V-4 engine. It has four valves per cylinder, overhead camshafts with shim over bucket valve adjustment. The five speed transmission {{is integral with}} the engine case. The engine and transmission share lubricating oil. The drive shaft and final drive assembly are built into {{the left side of}} the double sided swing arm. Swing arm motion is damped by an <b>air</b> <b>preloaded</b> monoshock mounted in the center of the frame. The clutch is of the wet plate design and is hydraulically activated by the left hand lever.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} the {{measurement}} of wafers and flat panels, {{it is very important}} to place the sensor chip precisely and without any contact along the surface. Therefore, the chip is integrated directly into the bearing’s surface. The maximum distance tolerance to the surface which refers to the gap variation of the air bearing, is smaller than 0.5 µm. When placing the air bearing with the sensor chip, they must not touch the wafer surface being measured. As for the up-and-down movement, a pneumatic piston is used which is, for repeatability reasons, also air-guided. The <b>preload</b> of the <b>air</b> bearing and thus the gap height are also adjusted with this piston.|$|R
50|$|Besides {{the engine}} configuration, the bike had water cooling, a {{six-speed}} transmission for good economy at highway speed, and common on other middleweight bikes for Honda {{in the early}} 1980s, shaft drive. While the shaft drive is very convenient with virtually no maintenance required (and no oil getting slung around), it also robbed some power from where it was more evidently lacking on in town or lower speed riding. Features like twin horns, hydraulic clutch, and an engine temperature gauge add nice touches to the bike. A coil sprung, oil bath, <b>air</b> <b>preload</b> front fork with anti-dive valving was an improvement, although the Magna did not benefit from the linkage based single shock {{that was on the}} Sabre and Interceptor.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of heel pressure ulcers after hip surgery {{is not entirely}} understood. The purpose of this one-group, prospective, repeated-measures design {{study was to examine}} how the external pressure of the bed surface affects heel skin oxygen tension in adults on the first 3 days after hip surgery. Transcutaneous oxygen sensors were placed on the plantar surface of each foot, close to the heels. Measures were taken on room air and with an oxygen challenge with the heels (1) suspended above the bed surface (preload), (2) on the bed surface for 15 minutes (loading), and (3) again suspended above the bed surface for 15 minutes (unloading). Eighteen hip surgery patients (mean age 58. 3 ± 16. 1 years) from two hospitals participated. When compared with <b>preload</b> on room <b>air,</b> both loading and unloading on all 3 days resulted in a reduction in heel oxygen tension bilaterally (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). Heel oxygenation decreased without the anticipated hyperemic response, raising the question of whether this is a sign of increased pressure ulcer risk. Further work is needed to understand why this short period of external pressure results in decreased oxygenation and why oxygen tension does not return to baseline when pressure is removed...|$|R
