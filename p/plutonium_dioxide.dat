25|$|While water-insoluble {{forms of}} {{plutonium}} such as <b>plutonium</b> <b>dioxide</b> are very {{harmful to the}} lungs, this toxicity is not relevant during a Loss Of Coolant Accident (LOCA) because plutonium is very involatile and unlikely to leave the reactor in large amounts. <b>Plutonium</b> <b>dioxide</b> has a very high boiling point. The toxic effect of the plutonium to the public under these conditions is much {{less than that of}} iodine-131 and caesium.

25|$|Casting {{and then}} {{machining}} plutonium is difficult {{not only because}} of its toxicity, but also because plutonium has many different metallic phases. As plutonium cools, changes in phase result in distortion and cracking. This distortion is normally overcome by alloying it with 30-35 mMol (0.9–1.0% by weight) gallium, forming a plutonium-gallium alloy, which causes it to take up its delta phase over a wide temperature range. When cooling from molten it then has only a single phase change, from epsilon to delta, instead of the four changes it would otherwise pass through. Other trivalent metals would also work, but gallium has a small neutron absorption cross section and helps protect the plutonium against corrosion. A drawback is that gallium compounds are corrosive and so if the plutonium is recovered from dismantled weapons for conversion to <b>plutonium</b> <b>dioxide</b> for power reactors, there is the difficulty of removing the gallium.|$|E

40|$|In this report, Los Alamos {{scientists}} characterize properties {{relevant to}} storage of an impure plutonium oxide (74 mass % plutonium) {{in accordance with}} the Department of Energy (DOE) standard DOE-STD- 3013 - 96. This oxide is of interest because it is the first impure plutonium oxide sample to be evaluated and it is similar to other materials that must be stored. Methods used to characterize the oxide at certain points during calcination include surface-area analyses, mass loss-on-ignition (LOI) measurements, elemental analysis, moisture-adsorption measurements, and quantitative supercritical-CO{sub 2 } extraction of adsorbed water. Significant decreases in the LOI and surface area occurred as the oxide was calcined at progressively increasing temperatures. Studies indicate that supercritical-CO{sub 2 } extraction is an effective method for removing adsorbed water from oxides. We extracted the water from powdered oxides (high-purity ZrO{sub 2 }, pure PuO{sub 2 }, and impure plutonium oxide) using CO{sub 2 } at 3000 psi pressure and 75 {degrees}C, and we quantitatively determined it by using gravimetric and dew-point procedures. The effectiveness of the extraction method is demonstrated by good agreement between the amounts of water extracted from pure zirconium and <b>plutonium</b> <b>dioxides</b> and the mass changes obtained from LOI analyses. However, the amount of moisture (0. 025 mass %) extracted from the impure plutonium oxide after it had been calcined at 950 {degrees}C and stored for a period of months is much less than the LOI value (0. 97 mass %). These results imply that the impure plutonium oxide is free of adsorbed water after calcination at 950 {degrees}C, even though the sample does not satisfy the LOI requirement of < 0. 50 mass % for storage...|$|R
5000|$|Thorium dioxide (thoria) {{can be used}} {{in nuclear}} {{reactors}} as ceramic fuel pellets, typically contained in nuclear fuel rods clad with zirconium alloys. Thorium is not fissile (but is [...] "fertile", breeding fissile uranium-233 under neutron bombardment); hence, it must be used as a nuclear reactor fuel in conjunction with fissile isotopes of either uranium or plutonium. This can be achieved by blending thorium with uranium or plutonium, or using it in its pure form in conjunction with separate fuel rods containing uranium or <b>plutonium.</b> Thorium <b>dioxide</b> offers advantages over conventional uranium dioxide fuel pellets, because of its higher thermal conductivity (lower operating temperature), considerably higher melting point, and chemical stability (does not oxidize in the presence of water/oxygen, unlike uranium dioxide).|$|R

40|$|The common oxides of <b>plutonium</b> are the <b>dioxide</b> (PuO 2) and the {{sesquioxide}} (Pu 2 O 3). The {{nature of}} an oxide on plutonium metal under air {{at room temperature}} is typically described as a thick PuO 2 film at the gas-oxide interface with a thinner Pu 2 O 3 film near the oxide-metal substrate interface. In a reducing environment, such as ultra high vacuum, the dioxide (Pu 4 +; O/Pu= 2. 0) readily converts to the sesquioxide (Pu 3 +; O/Pu= 1. 5) with time. In this work, the growth and evolution of thin plutonium oxide films is studied with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) under varying conditions. The results indicate that, like the dioxide, the sesquioxide is not stable on a clean metal substrate under reducing conditions, resulting in substoichiometric films (Pu 2 O 3 -y).

40|$|Test L 5 {{simulated}} {{a hypothetical}} loss-of-flow accident in an LMFBR using three (<b>plutonium,</b> uranium) <b>dioxide</b> fuel {{elements of the}} FTR type. The test elements were irradiated before TREAT Test L 5 in the General Electric Test Reactor to 8 at. % burnup at about 40 kW/m. The pre-irradiation in GETR caused a fuel-restructuring range characteristic of moderate-power structure relative to the FTR. The test transient was devised so that a power burst would be initiated at incipient cladding melting after the loss of flow. The test simulation corresponds to a scenario for FTR in which fuel in high-power-structure subassemblies slump, resulting in a power excursion. The remaining subassemblies are subjected to this power burst. Test L 5 addressed the fuel-motion behavior of the subassemblies in this latter category. Data from test-vehicle sensors, hodoscope, and post-mortem examinations were used to construct {{the sequence of events}} within the test zone. From these observations, the fuel underwent a predominantly dispersive event just after reaching a peak power six times nominal at, or after, scram. The fuel motion was apparently driven by the release of entrained fission-product gases, since fuel vapor pressure was deliberately kept below significant levels for the transient. The test remains show a wide range of microstructural evolution, depending on the extent of heat deposition along the active fuel column. Extensive fuel swelling was also observed {{as a result of the}} lack of the cladding restraint.

A systematic analysis of the An- 5 f states is performed which provides intuitive connections between the electronic structures and the local crystalline fields of the f states in the AnO 2 series. Particularly the mechanisms leading to the experimentally observed insulating ground states are investigated. These are found to be caused by the strong spin-orbit and Coulomb interactions of the 5 f orbitals; however, as a result of the different configurations, this mechanism works in distinctly different ways for each of the AnO 2 compounds. In agreement with experimental observations, the nonmagnetic states of <b>plutonium</b> and curium <b>dioxide</b> are computed to be insulating, whereas those of uranium, neptunium, and americium dioxides require additional symmetry breaking to reproduce the insulator ground states, a condition which is met with magnetic phase transitions.

However <b>plutonium</b> <b>dioxide</b> containing a natural abundance of oxygen emits ~23x103 n/sec/g of plutonium-238. This emission rate is relatively high compared to the neutron emission rate of plutonium-238 metal. The metal containing no light element impurities emits ~2.8x103 n/sec/g of plutonium-238. These neutrons are produced by the spontaneous fission of plutonium-238. The difference in the emission rates of the metal and the oxide is due mainly to the alpha, neutron reaction with the oxygen-18 and oxygen-17 present in the oxide. The normal amount of oxygen-18 present in the natural form is 0.204% while that of oxygen-17 is 0.037%. The reduction of the oxygen-17 and oxygen-18 present in <b>plutonium</b> <b>dioxide</b> will result in a much lower neutron emission rate for the oxide; this can be accomplished by a gas phase 16O2 exchange method. Regular production batches of 238PuO2 particles precipitated as a hydroxide were used to show that large production batches could be effectively 16O2-exchanged on a routine basis. High-fired 238PuO2 microspheres were successfully 16O2-exchanged showing that an exchange will take place regardless of the previous heat treatment history of the 238PuO2. Emission Rate Reduction in PuO2 This lowering of the neutron emission rate of PuO2 containing normal oxygen by a factor of 5 was discovered during the Cardiac Pacemaker research at Mound in 1966, due in part to Mound's experience with production of stable isotopes beginning in 1960. For production of the large heat sources the shielding required would have been prohibitive without this process.

The US Department of Energy has conducted seawater tests and determined that the graphite casing, which was designed to withstand reentry, is stable and no release of plutonium should occur. Subsequent investigations have found no increase in the natural background radiation in the area.
