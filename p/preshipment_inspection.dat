40|$|Many {{developing}} countries use <b>preshipment</b> <b>inspection</b> (PSI) firms {{to counter the}} adverse effects on their foreign trade of certain pricing and business practices. These firms may also perform some national customs functions, but their key responsibility is normally to verify that imports (and sometimes exports) meet quality and quantity standards and that prices are within established norms. Developing countries make substantial payments for PSI - charges appear to average about 1 percent {{of the value of}} the goods inspected - but have undertaken no comprehensive cost-benefit studies of PSI. Using data from Madagascar's experience, the author analyzes the impact of PSI on Madagascar's relative import prices. The results suggest that Madagascar paid considerably higher prices than other developing and industrial countries both before and after PSI was adopted. In other words, <b>preshipment</b> <b>inspection</b> failed to reduce Madagascar's import prices to the level of those paid by other importers. Extreme prices occur for all types of goods imported by Madagascar but are clustered in chemicals and basic manufactures. Evidence suggests that collaborative false invoicing by Madagascar importers and industrial country exports is one reason for the excessive prices both before and after adoption of PSI.

40|$|Can governments improve bureaucratic {{performance}} by "hiring integrity" {{from the private}} sector? In the past 2 decades, a number of developing countries have hired private firms to conduct <b>preshipment</b> <b>inspections</b> of imports, generating independent data on the value and tariff classification of incoming shipments. I find that countries implementing such inspection programs subsequently experience large increases in import duty collections. By contrast, {{the growth rate of}} other tax revenues does not change appreciably. Additional evidence suggests that declines in falsification of import documentation are behind the import duty improvements; the programs also lead to declines in undervaluation and misreporting of goods classifications. Historically, this hired integrity appears to have been cost-effective, with improvements in import duty collections in the first 5 years of a typical inspection program amounting to 2. 6 times the program's costs.

40|$|Can governments {{successfully}} combat {{bureaucratic corruption}} by “hiring integrity” {{from the private}} sector? This paper examines the impact of hiring private firms to collect information for government anti-corruption efforts. In the past two decades, a number of developing countries have hired private firms to conduct <b>preshipment</b> <b>inspections</b> of imports, generating data that governments can use to fight corruption in customs agencies. I find that countries implementing such inspection programs subsequently experience large increases in {{the growth rate of}} import duties, by 6 to 8 percentage points annually. By contrast, the growth rate of other tax revenues does not change appreciably. Additional evidence suggests that declines in customs corruption are behind the import duty improvements: the programs also lead to increases in imports (potentially reflecting lower bribe payments) and to declines in mis-reporting of goods classifications. Historically, this hired integrity appears to have been cost-effective: accumulated improvements in import duty collections in the fifth year of a typical inspection program were roughly 5 times accumulated costs. corruption, crime, bribery, enforcement, tax evasion, customs...|$|R
40|$|<b>Preshipment</b> <b>inspection</b> (PSI) {{programmes}} {{are implemented}} {{in many developing}} countries to assist governments in the collection of revenue at their borders. These programmes consist of the delegation of the inspection of imports to a private firm. To study these PSI programmes, we develop a hierarchical agency model in which the government authority can rely on two supervisors, namely the private inspection firm and the customs administration, to control importers' declarations. The government's optimal contract is fully characterized. We devote some attention to the inspection policy and its comparative statics properties. In particular, we identify the situations in which PSI programmes are revenue enhancing. We also discuss the reconciliation policy, i. e. what to do in case of conflicting inspection reports by the inspection firm and the customs administration. In the optimal mechanism, mutual supervision between the inspection firm and the customs administration is used to provide adequate incentives to all parties...|$|E
