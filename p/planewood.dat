50|$|In 1349 Hnanishoʿ's {{remains were}} exhumed by the Nestorians of Mosul. The patriarch {{had been buried}} in the monastery of Jonah, on the east bank of the Tigris {{opposite}} Mosul, and when the tomb was opened his body, lying in a coffin of <b>planewood,</b> {{was found to be}} in a miraculous state of preservation. The historian ʿAmr, who saw the body for himself, said that crowds came to view the dead patriarch, who seemed to be only sleeping. The monastery was confiscated and turned into a place of Muslim pilgrimage shortly afterwards, and when Timur Leng visited it in 1393 it had undergone a remarkable transformation. Hnanishoʿ was no longer remembered and Timur was shown the tomb of the prophet Jonah himself. The 'tomb of Jonah' still exists, and visitors are still shown a heavy <b>planewood</b> coffin, reverently shrouded with a green cloth, in which the prophet supposedly lies buried. Some historians suspect that for the past six centuries the Muslim faithful have been paying their devotions to the petrified corpse of a Christian patriarch.|$|E
