ClyA formed oligomeric pore assemblies in the OMVs, and the cytotoxic activity toward mammalian cells was considerably {{higher than that of}} ClyA protein purified from the bacterial periplasm. The redox status of ClyA correlated with its ability to form the oligomeric pore assemblies.

The other mutant is blocked at stage IV to V and has a long temperature-sensitive period that starts during stage III and precedes the stage at which the mutational defect is <b>phenotypically</b> <b>expressed.</b> The behavior of this mutant in temperature-shift experiments suggests that synthesis of the product of the defective gene commences long before it assumes its physiological function...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe fitness {{effects of}} {{mutations}} {{on a given}} genotype are rarely constant across environments to which this genotype {{is more or less}} adapted, that is, between more or less stressful conditions. This can have important implications, especially on the evolution of ecological specialization. Stress is thought to increase the variance of mutations' fitness effects, their average, or the number of <b>expressed</b> <b>mutations.</b> Although empirical evidence is available for these three mechanisms, their relative magnitude is poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a simple approach to discriminate between these mechanisms, using a survey of empirical measures of mutation effects in contrasted environments. This survey, across various species and environments, shows that stress mainly increases the variance of mutations' effects on fitness, with a much more limited impact on their average effect or on the number of <b>expressed</b> <b>mutations.</b> This pattern is consistent with a simple model in which fitness is a Gaussian function of phenotypes around an environmentally determined optimum. These results suggest that a simple, mathematically tractable landscape model may not be quantitatively as unrealistic as previously suggested.

Importantly, however, for mutants carrying the M 184 V mutation or M 41 L+T 215 Y mutations, a defect could be detected by using target cells in which dATP pools had been reduced by pretreatment with hydroxyurea. Based on these observations, we developed a recombinant-virus assay to assess the effects of hydroxyurea pretreatment on infectivity of viruses carrying plasma-derived RT sequences from patients with nucleoside resistance. Using this assay, we found that many, but not all, viruses carrying RT resistance mutations display an increased sensitivity to hydroxyurea, suggesting that the impact of RT resistance mutations on viral replication may be more profound in cell populations characterized by smaller dNTP pools...|$|R

The totally inactive chromosome of a stable Ncd can be activated after PEG-induced self fusion. DNA-mediated transformation studies using crude stable Ncd lysates as DNA donors show low frequencies for the genetic markers from the 'silent' chromosome. Contrary to the unstable Ncd situation, however, these frequencies remain low even with purified donor DNA. The differences in the transformation properties of the non-expressed markers are correlated to Ncd clone stability. These facts suggest that chromosome inactivation in PEG-induced fusion involves at least a two-stage process.

Restoration of pollen fertility in T-cytoplasm maize is controlled by dominant alleles at two unlinked, complementary, nuclear-encoded genes, rf 1 and rf 2. As a first step in the molecular isolation of the rf 2 gene, 178, 300 gametes derived from plants that carried the Mutator, Cy or Spm transposon families were screened for rf 2 mutant alleles (rf 2 -m) via their inability to restore pollen fertility to T-cytoplasm male-sterile maize. Seven heritable rf 2 -m alleles were recovered from these transposon populations. Pedigrees and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) -based analyses indicated that all seven rf 2 -m alleles were derived independently. The ability to obtain rf 2 -m derivatives from Rf 2 suggests that Rf 2 alleles produce a functional product necessary to restore pollen fertility to cmsT. Molecular markers flanking the rf 1 and rf 2 loci were used to decipher segregation patterns in progenies segregating for the rf 2 -m alleles.

Under low levels of oxygen (hypoxia), cells expressing wild-type p 53 undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis), whereas cells <b>expressing</b> <b>mutations</b> in the p 53 gene may survive and express angiogenic growth factors that stimulate tumour vascularization. Given that cells <b>expressing</b> <b>mutations</b> in the p 53 gene have been observed in many forms of human tumour, it is important to understand how both wild-type and mutant cells react to hypoxic conditions. In this paper a mathematical model is presented to investigate the effects of alternating periods of hypoxia and normoxia (normal oxygen levels) on a population of wild-type and mutant p 53 tumour cells. The model consists of three coupled ordinary differential equations that describe the densities of the two cell types and the oxygen concentration and, as such, may describe the growth of avascular tumours in vitro and/or in vivo. Numerical and analytical techniques are used to determine how changes in the system parameters influence the time at which mutant cells become dominant within the population. A feedback mechanism, which switches off the oxygen supply when the total cell density exceeds a threshold value, is introduced into the model to investigate the impact that vessel collapse (and the associated hypoxia) has on the time at which the mutant cells become dominant within vascular tumours growing in vivo. Using the model we can predict the time it takes for a subpopulation of mutant p 53 tumour cells to become the dominant population within either an avascular tumour or a localized region of a vascular tumour. Based on independent experimental results, our model suggests that the mutant population becomes dominant more quickly in vivo than in vitro (12 days vs 17 days) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMutational (genetic) {{robustness}} is phenotypic constancy in {{the face}} of mutational changes to the genome. Robustness is critical to the understanding of evolution because <b>phenotypically</b> <b>expressed</b> genetic variation is the fuel of natural selection. Nonetheless, the evidence for adaptive evolution of mutational robustness in biological populations is controversial. Robustness should be selectively favored when mutation rates are high, a common feature of RNA viruses. However, selection for robustness may be relaxed under virus co-infection because complementation between virus genotypes can buffer mutational effects. We therefore hypothesized that selection for genetic robustness in viruses will be weakened with increasing frequency of co-infection. To test this idea, we used populations of RNA phage phi 6 that were experimentally evolved at low and high levels of co-infection and subjected lineages of these viruses to mutation accumulation through population bottlenecking. The data demonstrate that viruses evolved under high co-infection show relatively greater mean magnitude and variance in the fitness changes generated by addition of random mutations, confirming our hypothesis that they experience weakened selection for robustness. Our study further suggests that co-infection of host cells may be advantageous to RNA viruses only in the short term. In addition, we observed higher mutation frequencies in the more robust viruses, indicating that evolution of robustness might foster less-accurate genome replication in RNA viruses...|$|R

The authors investigate whether this well-defined model for variation in circadian period exhibits associated changes in energy metabolism. In hamsters of the three genotypes (SS, S+, and wild type [WT]), oxygen consumption measurements were performed at 28 °C (thermoneutral), 18 °C, and (after acclimatization) 10 °C. After correction for body mass, SS tau mutant hamsters had a higher overall metabolic rate (average oxygen consumption per hour over 24 h) and a higher resting metabolic rate (the lowest 30 -min oxygen consumption in the subjective day) than did WT hamsters at all ambient temperatures. S+ hamsters were intermediate in both after taking body mass into account. The differences in metabolism among the three genotypes indicate that the increase in metabolic rate was statistically indistinguishable from a proportional increase in circadian frequency. The oxygen consumption totals per circadian cycle (24 h for WT, 22 h for S+, and 20 h for SS mutants) were not statistically different among the genotypes after correcting for body mass. The possible roles of pleiotropic effects, of linkage to genes involved in growth and metabolism, and of early ontogenetic influences are briefly discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} bursts- related EEG signals in a focal hand dystonia patient. Despite of considering time domain and frequency domain techniques as mutually exclusive analysis, in this contribution we have taken advantage from both of them: particularly, in the frequency domain, coherence was used to identify the most likely frequency bands of interaction between brain and muscles, then, in the time domain, cross-correlation was exploited to verify the physiological reliability of such a relationship in terms of signal transmission delay from the centre to the periphery. Our preliminary results suggest - in line with recent literature - that activity in the high beta band (around 30 Hz) could represent an electroencephalographic correlate for the pathological electromyographic bursts affecting the focal hand dystonia condition. Even though a future study on a larger sample is needed to statistically support these preliminary findings, this contribution allows to think of new kinds of rehabilitation from focal hand dystonia that could target the actual electroencephalographic correlate of the pathology, i. e. <b>phenotypically</b> <b>expressed</b> by bursts, with the consequence of a relevant functional improvement.
