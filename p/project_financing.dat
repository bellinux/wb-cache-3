40|$|The {{academic}} research into <b>Project</b> <b>Finance</b> lags {{far behind the}} practice of it. <b>Project</b> <b>Finance,</b> with limited or non recourse debt as its defining characteristic, has been growing tremendously since 2001 and is set to grow even further.

40|$|AbstractThe {{nature of}} <b>project</b> <b>finance</b> is risk {{allocation}}. Effective risk allocation can improve project performances.

However, during the risk allocation of actual <b>project</b> <b>finance,</b> the participants’ degree of risk tolerance is very abstract and difficult to be measured. According to the elements of risk allocation, the method and procedure of risk allocation is put forward in this study based on the rule of risk allocation in <b>project</b> <b>finance.</b> The rule and method of risk allocation proposed in this paper {{could serve as a}} guide for the development of <b>project</b> <b>finance</b> on theory and practice in China...|$|R

40|$|Compared {{to other}} areas of Finance, the field of <b>Project</b> <b>Finance</b> is a {{relatively}} unexplored area for both empirical and theoretical research. And in particular, most of the research to date has focused more narrowly on risk management through financial instruments. From another point of view and by looking at different types of projects, Cross Border projects are usually considered 'high risk', mostly {{due to a lack of}} adequate overseas environmental information and overseas project experience. Given this setting, this research aims to explore risks attributed to Cross Border <b>Project</b> <b>Financed</b> <b>projects</b> and understand why South African companies should or should not use <b>Project</b> <b>Finance</b> for their Cross Border projects. There were two phases to the research. The first phase consisted of an analysis of literature on <b>Project</b> <b>Finance,</b> the Cross Border project context and Risk Management processes and, the further analysis of fourteen case studies where Cross Border projects have used <b>Project</b> <b>Finance.</b> This was with the aim of extracting risks and relevant allocation and mitigation methods. The second phase consisted of ten interviews with South African <b>Project</b> <b>Finance</b> experts, based on findings from phase one. This phase’s aim was to explore the practical risk allocation and mitigation methods and compare them to what was said in theory, making recommendations for further research into <b>Project</b> <b>Finance</b> in South Africa. The first phase resulted in a broad description of the theory of risks associated with Cross Border <b>Project</b> <b>Financed</b> <b>projects</b> and those specific risks and allocation or mitigation methods addressed in Cross Border projects that have used <b>Project</b> <b>Finance</b> as their financing vehicle. The second phase produced a comparative scheme between what is being addressed in theory as risk allocation and mitigation methods and what is being exercised in South African <b>Project</b> <b>Financed</b> <b>projects.</b> This comparison showed that <b>Project</b> <b>Finance</b> is a recommended financing vehicle for Cross Border projects provided that required due diligence and homework are done upfront. It was concluded that there is a gap between theory and practice in terms of risk allocation and mitigation methods developed for Cross Border <b>Project</b> <b>Financed</b> <b>projects.</b> This research provided a framework to introduce similarities and differences between theory and practice and ended up with a set of recommendations for further research into <b>Project</b> <b>Finance.</b> Dissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013.

40|$|<b>Project</b> <b>finance</b> is {{the process}} of {{financing}} a specific economic unit that the sponsors create, in which creditors share much of the venture’s business risk and funding is obtained strictly for the <b>project</b> itself. <b>Project</b> <b>finance</b> creates value by reducing the costs of funding, maintaining the sponsors financial flexibility, increasing the leverage ratios, avoiding contamination risk, reducing corporate taxes, improving risk management, and reducing the costs associated with market imperfections. However, <b>project</b> <b>finance</b> transactions are complex undertakings, they have higher costs of borrowing when compared to conventional financing and the negotiation of the financing and operating agreements is time-consuming. In addition to describing the economic motivation for the use of <b>project</b> <b>finance,</b> this paper provides details on <b>project</b> <b>finance</b> characteristics and players, presents the recent trends of the <b>project</b> <b>finance</b> market and provides some statistics in relation to <b>project</b> <b>finance</b> lending activity between 2000 and 2014. Statistical analysis shows that <b>project</b> <b>finance</b> loans arranged for U.

40|$|In {{the view}} of the {{economic}} conditions and infrastructural needs of the Polish economy <b>project</b> <b>finance</b> as an investment strategy should certainly gain in popularity in the coming years in Poland. What makes this method especially desirable is above all insufficient investment capital in Polish companies. Additionally, this deficit deprives companies of possible support from the State. <b>Project</b> <b>finance</b> gives real benefits to project sponsors, who have an opportunity to make investments outside their own companies. Because whole businesses are founded from scratch in the process, such investments create jobs at a number of stages. Beside businesses and the State Treasury, also banks can benefit as lenders from <b>project</b> <b>finance</b> by earning profits from loan interests.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to show the {{importance}} of using <b>project</b> <b>finance</b> in infrastructure investments in developing countries. The paper will be focused only on one infrastructure sector, which is energy. Structurally, power <b>project</b> <b>finance</b> has involved largely buildown-transfer (BOT) project structures and long-term contracts. The projects largely reflect a rational allocation of risks among public and private participants. Private sponsors and lenders generally assume risks for completion and performance. Governments assume substantial risks in nearly all projects, mostly in areas in which they have control, such as utility performance, currency convertibility, fuel costs, inflation, and political event. The aim of this research is to empirically examine a financing and governance structure called <b>Project</b> <b>Finance</b> that typically funds large scale, capital intensive, infrastructure investments in risky countries. The methodology used in this paper is literature review of the main theories for <b>project</b> <b>finance.</b> I will empirically test the propensity of the firms to use <b>project</b> <b>finance,</b> using data of some projects in South –East countries.

40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>Project</b> <b>Finance</b> as {{a private}} response to ine ¢ ciencies created by weak legal protection of outside investors. In the context of large investment <b>projects,</b> <b>Project</b> <b>Finance</b> o¤ers a contractual and organizational substitute for investor protection laws by making cash ‡ows veri…able, thereby enhancing debt capacity. <b>Project</b> <b>Finance</b> makes cash ‡ows veri…able through: (i) contractual arrangements made possible by structuring the Project Company as a single, discrete project legally separate from the sponsor; and (ii) private enforcement of these contracts through a network of project accounts that ensures lender control of project cash ‡ows.

40|$|The study set out {{to explore}} the concept of Islamic <b>Project</b> <b>Finance</b> (IPF) and to examine its main legal and {{regulatory}} challenges in Saudi Arabia (KSA). Having as a primary objective the development and improvement of IPF in the <b>project</b> <b>finance</b> market in KSA, the thesis consists of a theoretical, conceptual study of Islamic <b>project</b> <b>finance,</b> before examining the current performance of IFIs in <b>project</b> <b>finance,</b> and eventually identifying the most prominent legal and regulatory challenges of IPF. The theoretical part, which spreads {{in the first three}} chapters, examines the concept of conventional <b>project</b> <b>finance</b> and how close it is to the principle and philosophy of Islamic finance. It is argued that the <b>project</b> <b>finance</b> mechanism is the most suitable financial tool for the objectives of Islamic finance. It is established that not only both mechanisms share similar underlying philosophies in different aspects, for instance the risk-sharing and profit generation methods, but also, in terms of principle, none of the rules of Islamic finance would be breached or violated by <b>project</b> <b>finance,</b> and most of its rules could be easily adapted. In the examination of the current performance of IPF and its regulatory and legal challenges in KSA, this study argues that the absence of sound regulation and standardisation for the Islamic finance industry has been having a detrimental impact on the efficiency and productivity of Islamic <b>finance</b> in the <b>project</b> <b>finance</b> market. The legal limbo the industry has found itself into not only creates a number of serious challenges, including sharia-compliance, inconsistency among SSBs, and sharia governance over IFI products in the event of dispute, but also hinders any ambition to operate in the highest level, while holding its principles and philosophy. From the analysis emerges the conclusion that three essential strategies will allow the IPF industry to develop and thrive in the <b>project</b> <b>finance</b> market: the increase of equity finance investments, the reconsideration of the traditional <b>project</b> <b>finance</b> structure, and the standardisation and regulation of the Islamic finance industry...|$|R
