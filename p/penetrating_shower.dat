The 48 " magnet-cloud chamber has been {{controlled by a}} gated proportional counter and photographs taken of 5313 expansions have been analyzed. The proportional counter was found to (1) select events of lower energy than <b>penetrating</b> <b>shower</b> detectors; and (2) select {{at a much lower}} hourly rate interactions in which V-particles were produced. However, the V-particles detected appeared on the average to be of lower energy, hence, could be measured with maximum cloud-chamber accuracy. The [mu]-meson-induced electron showers detected by the proportional counter have been analyzed. Experimental and theoretical frequencies were obtained for the production of showers with a minimum of 40, 100, and 200 electrons. The frequencies for showers of 100 and 200 electrons were found to be the most reliable. These experimental frequencies are [ [...] . ] per second and [ [...] . ] per second, respectively.

40|$|The {{existence}} of extra {{degrees of freedom}} beyond the electroweak scale may allow the formation of black holes in nearly horizontal neutrino air showers. In this paper we examine the average properties of the light descendants of these black holes.

Naturally occurring black holes in horizontal neutrino showers could be detected and studied with the Auger air shower array.

5000|$|In 1945, at the {{invitation}} of the Rockefeller Foundation, Damy spent nine months at the University of Illinois. where he worked with Prof. Donald William Kerst, inventor of the betatron. Returning once again to Brazil, Damy accepted an assistant professorship at the Department of Physics of USP, and helped install there in 1950 a betatron, the first particle accelerator operating in Latin America. He also developed and installed the first nuclear reactor in Brazil, still in working order today. Another area of research of Damy was cosmic rays, particularly aimed at assessing the nature of the <b>penetrating</b> <b>showers</b> of cosmic rays. He demonstrated that these showers had atomic particles such as mesons, which had a great penetrating power without losing considerably part of its energy. Along with Gleb Wataghin and Paulus Aulus Pompéia he found that these showers are more energetic than previously supposed. This work was published internationally.|$|R

His name is linked to Geiger's coincidence detector development with special application to cosmic-ray secondary components created in the upper layers of the atmosphere (mesons such as kaons, muons, gamma rays). He demonstrated how primary cosmic rays colliding with the Earth's atmosphere produced secondary <b>penetrating</b> <b>showers</b> cascading {{to the surface of the}} earth (1940-1941). [...] From an early age to his death, he had a wide-ranging interest in the mathematical and statistical aspects of physical analysis, and, in particular, the application of probability and calculus to experimental results in nuclear physics and particle physics. He is known for his statistical analysis methods for cosmic rays. Specifically, during his stay in Dublin, he completed his classic monograph on cosmic rays (1948) and published important monographs on particle showers (1950), introducing the eponymous joint probability densities—now called Jánossy densities—in the theory of random point processes.|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of cosmic rays with energies above 10 ** 6 GeV {{have to be}} deduced from the spacetime structure and particle content of the air showers which they initiate. In this review we summarize the phenomenology of these giant air showers. We describe the hadronic interaction models used to extrapolate results from collider data to ultra high energies, and discuss the prospects for insights into forward physics at the LHC. We also describe the main electromagnetic processes that govern the longitudinal shower evolution, {{as well as the}} lateral spread of particles. Armed with these two principal shower ingredients and motivation from the underlying physics, we provide an overview of some of the different methods proposed to distinguish primary species. The {{properties of}} neutrino interactions and the potential of forthcoming experiments to isolate deeply <b>penetrating</b> <b>showers</b> from baryonic cascades are also discussed.

In {{a set of}} 23, 000 cloud chamber photographs taken {{in a study of}} <b>penetrating</b> <b>showers,</b> 134 examples of the decay of neutral V-particles were observed. These have been analyzed in an endeavor to determine the properties associated with this phenomenon. It is apparent in the great majority of cases that the two charged decay products are protons and negative [pi]-mesons. There is, however, a significant number of data available to indicate the existence of other charged decay-products; the poor quality of these events has unfortunately prevented an interpretation in terms of a decay scheme. No direct evidence has been observed which indicates the existence of neutral secondary particles, and the statistical data are consistent with a two-body decay scheme. Q-values have been calculated under the assumption of a two-body decay into a negative [pi]-meson and a proton; these values range from 10 ? 3 Mev to about 87 ? 15 Mev. It is exceedingly difficult to reconcile the observed results with any unique Q-value. Other interesting events which were observed in these experiments included charged V-particles and heavy mesons.

40|$|In {{this work}} we explore the {{possibility}} that the formation of Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) during the first interactions of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) may result in observable signatures in ground profile and shower particle composition that could conceivably be detectable by an air shower array experiment such as the Pierre Auger Observatory. Knowledge of whether QGP formation affects the properties of UHECR development will further the understanding of both UHECR behavior and high energy hadronic interaction behavior. We find that {{for the vast majority of}} showers signals of QGP do not manifest themselves in ways that are observable, but on rare occasion, such as within deeply <b>penetrating</b> <b>showers,</b> observable signals can be seen. Results show potential for QGP detection at 100 PeV initial energy at an initial interaction event height of 12 km through a μ^± excess at 10 GeV between 100 - 300 m from the shower core favoring QGP forming events. In contrast, higher initial interaction heights of 24 and 36 km at 100 PeV initial energy show no significant potential for QGP detection. Unfortunately at present, the 12 km observable signals cannot be seen with current detectors, such as the Pierre Auger Observatory[1]; however, there may be potential for detection in future experiments.

40|$|If extra spacetime {{dimensions}} and low-scale gravity exist, black holes will {{be produced in}} observable collisions of elementary particles. For the next several years, ultra-high energy cosmic rays provide the most promising window on this phenomenon. In particular, cosmic neutrinos can produce black holes deep in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to quasi-horizontal giant air showers. We determine the sensitivity of cosmic ray detectors to black hole production and compare the results to other probes of extra dimensions. With n > 4 extra dimensions, current bounds on deeply <b>penetrating</b> <b>showers</b> from AGASA already provide the most stringent bound on low-scale gravity, requiring a fundamental Planck scale M_D > 1. 3 - 1. 8 TeV. The Auger Observatory will probe M_D as large as 4 TeV and may observe {{on the order of}} a hundred black holes in 5 years. We also consider the implications of angular momentum and possible exponentially suppressed parton cross sections; including these effects, large black hole rates are still possible. Finally, we demonstrate that even if only a few black hole events are observed, a standard model interpretation may be excluded by comparison with Earth-skimming neutrino rates.

The Observatory is sensitive not only to hadrons and photons, but can in principle detect ultrahigh energy neutrinos in the cosmic radiation. Interestingly, {{it may be possible}} to uncover new physics by analyzing characteristics of the neutrino flux at the Earth. By comparing the rate for quasi-horizontal, deeply <b>penetrating</b> air <b>showers</b> triggered by all types of neutrinos, with the rate for slightly upgoing showers generated by Earth-skimming tau neutrinos, we determine the ratio of events which would need to be detected in order to signal the existence of new non-perturbative interactions beyond the TeV-scale in which the final state energy is dominated by the hadronic component. We use detailed Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the effects of interactions in the Earth and in the atmosphere. We find that observation of 1 Earth-skimming and 10 quasi-horizontal events would exclude the standard model at the 99 % confidence level. If new non-perturbative physics exists, a decade or so would be required to find it in the most optimistic case of a neutrino flux at the Waxman-Bahcall level and a neutrino-nucleon cross-section an order of magnitude above the standard model prediction.

40|$|We {{discuss in}} some detail the {{production}} of extremely high energy (EHE) neutrinos with energies above 10 ^ 18 eV. The most certain process for producing such neutrinos results from photopion production by EHE cosmic rays in the cosmic background photon field. However, using assumptions for the EHE cosmic ray source evolution which are consistent with results from the deep QSO survey in the radio and X-ray range, the resultant flux of neutrinos from this process is not strong enough for plausible detection. A measurable flux of EHE neutrinos may be present, however, if the highest energy cosmic rays which have recently been detected well beyond 10 ^ 20 eV {{are the result of}} the annihilation of topological defects which formed in the early universe. Neutrinos resulting from such decays reach energies of the grand unification (GUT) scale, and collisions of superhigh energy neutrinos with the cosmic background neutrinos initiate neutrino cascading which enhances the EHE neutrino flux at Earth. We have calculated the neutrino flux including this cascading effect for either massless or massive neutrinos and we find that these fluxes are conceivably detectable by air fluorescence detectors now in development. The neutrino-induced showers would be recognized by their starting deep in the atmosphere. We evaluate the feasibility of detecting EHE neutrinos this way using air fluorescence air shower detectors and derive the expected event rate.

40|$|In {{a set of}} 23, 000 cloud-chamber {{photographs}} taken {{in a study of}} <b>penetrating</b> <b>showers,</b> 134 examples of the decay of neutral V-particles, and 18 of the decay of charged V-particles, were observed. An analysis of the 152 examples leads to the following principal conclusions: (1) V-particles result from the impact of mesons and probably also of nucleons, upon nuclei. (2) V-particles are generally produced singly and not in pairs. (3) Two independent kinds of data, one based on measurements of angles and other purely spatial relationships, and the other based on measurements of momentum and specific ionization, lead to the conclusion that more than 80 percent of these neutral V-particles decayed by the production of a heavy positive and a light negative particle. The mass of the heavy positive particle in most instances was consistent with that of a proton, but in a few cases may have been somewhat less. The negative particle appeared most often to be a π-meson, although in a few cases a μ-meson was indicated. In about 7 percent of the cases, the positive particle was light and had a mass consistent with that of a π- or μ-meson. In these cases the mass of the negative particle was not well determined. So far, therefore, in these investigations, there is no direct evidence that a neutral V-particle decays into two π-mesons, or into a positive π-meson and a negatively charged proton, although a few cases may be so interpreted. (4) The data are consistent with the assumption of a two-body decay for a majority of the neutral V-particles, and therefore a rather extensive analysis is given based upon this assumption. (5) The energy release, or Q-value, of the decay of neutral V-particles was computed, on the assumption of a two-body decay, for those cases in which the production of a heavy positive particle was clearly indicated, and where momentum measurements were possible. On the assumption of a decay into a proton and a π- meson, the Q-values obtained ranged from 10 Mev to about 100 Mev. The great majority of cases however, may be described in terms of discrete Q-values at 35 ± 3 Mev, and 75 ± 5 Mev, although, of course, the data are consistent with distributions about these values. For the same set of cases, if the positive particle is assumed to be as light even as 1250 me, and/or the negative particle is assumed to be a μ-meson, the distribution of Q-values is not greatly changed, and the apparent necessity for at least two different Q-values remains. In those few cases mentioned in (3) above, in which the positive particle was light, and in which the mass of the negative particle was undetermined, the energy release, computed {{on the basis of a}} two-body decay, depends upon the assumed identity of the decay products, and is about 100 - 130 Mev for the assumption that two π-mesons are produced, about 50 - 80 Mev for a positive π-meson and a negative τ-meson, and about 30 - 80 Mev for a positive π-meson and a negative proton. (6) The rest mean lifetime of V 0 particles, which appear to yield protons and π [...] mesons as decay products, was found to be 1. 6 × 10 - 10 sec for 26 cases having Q-values greater than 50 Mev, and 2. 9 × 10 - 10 sec for 48 cases having Q-values less than 50 Mev, on the assumption of a two-body decay. In view of the rather poor statistics, the above two lifetimes are consistent with a single value, and lead to an average of 2. 5 ± 0. 7 × 10 - 10 sec. The above lifetimes are not appreciably changed if a multibody decay of the neutral V-particle is assumed. (7) The data are not adequate to distinguish conclusively between a two-body and a multi-body decay, and, therefore, a discussion is also given in terms of a variety of possible decay schemes of the neutral V-particle...|$|R

We will also briefly review how observation and analysis of GCR interactions with planetary atmospheres and surfaces and reveal important compositional and geophysical data on earth and elsewhere. About 1000 GCR particles enter every square meter of Earths upper atmosphere every second, roughly the same number striking every square meter of the International Space Station (ISS) and every other low- Earth orbit spacecraft. GCR particles are high energy ionized atomic nuclei (90 % protons, 9 % alpha particles, 1 % heavier nuclei) traveling {{very close to the}} speed of light.
