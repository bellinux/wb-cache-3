5|$|Also, {{perching}} bird. Any bird of {{the order}} <b>Passeriformes,</b> which includes {{more than half of}} all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. The order has roughly twice as many species as Rodentia, the largest order of mammals. There are more than 110 families of passerine birds, the second-most of any tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles).|$|E
5|$|Nearly 200 {{parasitic}} Plasmodium {{species have}} been identified that infect birds, reptiles, and other mammals, and about 30 species naturally infect non-human primates. Some malaria parasites that affect non-human primates (NHP) serve as model organisms for human malarial parasites, such as P.coatneyi (a model for P.falciparum) and P.cynomolgi (P.vivax). Diagnostic techniques used to detect parasites in NHP {{are similar to those}} employed for humans. Malaria parasites that infect rodents are widely used as models in research, such as P.berghei. Avian malaria primarily affects species of the order <b>Passeriformes,</b> and poses a substantial threat to birds of Hawaii, the Galapagos, and other archipelagoes. The parasite P.relictum is known {{to play a role in}} limiting the distribution and abundance of endemic Hawaiian birds. Global warming is expected to increase the prevalence and global distribution of avian malaria, as elevated temperatures provide optimal conditions for parasite reproduction.|$|E

25|$|As no {{evidence}} indicates passerines were flightless {{when they arrived}} on New Zealand (that apomorphy is extremely rare and unevenly distributed in <b>Passeriformes),</b> they are not required by present theories to have been distinct in the Mesozoic. As unequivocal <b>Passeriformes</b> are known from Australia some 55 Mya, the acanthisittids' ancestors likely arrived in the Late Paleocene from Australia or the then-temperate Antarctic coasts. Plate tectonics indicate that the shortest distance between New Zealand and those two continents was roughly 1,500km (1,000 miles) at that time. New Zealand's minimum distance from Australia {{is a bit more}} today – some 1,700km/1,100 miles - whereas it is now at least 2,500km (1,550 miles) from Antarctica.|$|E
25|$|Bird song is best {{developed}} in the order <b>Passeriformes.</b> Some groups are nearly voiceless, producing only percussive and rhythmic sounds, such as the storks, which clatter their bills. In some manakins (Pipridae), the males have evolved several mechanisms for mechanical sound production, including mechanisms for stridulation not unlike those found in some insects.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{knowledge}} about the living passerines' interrelationships (see the list of families below) suggests that the last common ancestor of all living <b>Passeriformes</b> was a small forest bird, probably with a stubby tail and an overall drab coloration, but possibly with marked sexual dimorphism. The latter trait {{seems to have been}} lost and re-evolved multiple times in songbird evolution alone, judging from its distribution among the extant lineages.|$|E
25|$|The {{foot of a}} {{passerine}} {{has three}} toes directed forward and one toe directed backward, called anisodactyl arrangement. This arrangement enables the passerine birds to perch upon vertical surfaces, such as trees and cliffs. The toes have no webbing or joining, but in some cotingas, {{the second and third}} toes are united at their basal third. The hind toe joins the leg at the same level as the front toes. The <b>passeriformes</b> have this toe arrangement in common with hunting birds like eagles and falcons.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} passerine families and the relationships among them remained rather mysterious until the late 20th century. In many cases, passerine families were grouped together {{on the basis of}} morphological similarities that, it is now believed, are the result of convergent evolution, not a close genetic relationship. For example, the wrens of the Americas and Eurasia; those of Australia; and those of New Zealand look superficially similar and behave in similar ways, and yet belong to three far-flung branches of the passerine family tree; they are as unrelated as it is possible to be while remaining <b>Passeriformes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Wieslochia was {{possibly}} {{not a member}} of any extant suborder. That not only the Passeri expanded much beyond their region of origin is proven by an undetermined broadbill (Eurylaimidae) from the Early Miocene (roughly 20mya) of Wintershof, Germany, and the indeterminant Late Oligocene suboscine from France listed above. Even very basal <b>Passeriformes</b> might have been common in Europe until the Middle Miocene, some 12mya. Extant Passeri superfamilies were quite distinct by that time and are known since about 12–13 mya when modern genera were present in the corvoidean and basal songbirds. The modern diversity of Passerida genera is known mostly from the Late Miocene onwards and into the Pliocene (about 10–2mya). Pleistocene and early Holocene lagerstätten (<1.8nbsp&mya) yield numerous extant species, and many yield almost nothing but extant species or their chronospecies and paleosubspecies.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species of}} birds are tetrachromatic, with {{dedicated}} cone cells for perceiving wavelengths in the ultraviolet and violet regions of the light spectrum. These cells contain a combination of short wave sensitive (SWS1) opsins, SWS1-like opsins (SWS2), and long-wave filtering carotenoid pigments for selectively filtering and receiving light between 300 and 400 nm. There {{are two types of}} short wave color vision in birds: violet sensitive (VS) and ultraviolet sensitive (UVS). Single nucleotide substitutions in the SWS1 opsin sequence are responsible blue-shifting the spectral sensitivity of the opsin from violet sensitive (λmax = 400) to ultraviolet sensitive (λmax = 310-360). This is the proposed evolutionary mechanism by which ultraviolet vision originally arose. The major clades of birds that have UVS vision are Palaeognathae (ratites and tinamous), Charadriiformes (shorebirds, gulls, and alcids), Trogoniformes (trogons), Psittaciformes (parrots), and <b>Passeriformes</b> (perching birds, representing {{more than half of all}} avian species).|$|E

500|$|Red foxes are omnivores with {{a highly}} varied diet. In the former Soviet Union, up to 300 animal and a few dozen plant species {{are known to be}} {{consumed}} by them. They primarily feed on small rodents like voles, mice, ground squirrels, hamsters, gerbils, woodchucks, pocket gophers and deer mice. Secondary prey species include birds (with <b>passeriformes,</b> galliformes and waterfowl predominating), leporids, porcupines, raccoons, opossums, reptiles, insects, other invertebrates and flotsam (marine mammals, fish and echinoderms). On very rare occasions, foxes may attack young or small ungulates. They typically target mammals up to about [...] in weight, and they require [...] of food daily. Red foxes readily eat plant material, and in some areas fruit can amount to 100% of their diet in autumn. Commonly consumed fruits include blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, cherries, persimmons, mulberries, apples, plums, grapes, and acorns. Other plant material includes grasses, sedges and tubers.|$|E

2500|$|Perching bird osteology, {{especially}} of the limb bones, is rather diagnostic. However, the early fossil record is poor because the first <b>Passeriformes</b> were apparently on the small side of the present size range, and their delicate bones did not preserve well. Queensland Museum specimens F20688 (carpometacarpus) and F24685 (tibiotarsus) from Murgon, Queensland, are fossil bone fragments initially assigned to <b>Passeriformes.</b> However, the material is too fragmentary and their affinities have been questioned. Several more recent fossils from the Oligocene of Europe that are more complete definitely represent early passeriforms, although their exact position in the evolutionary tree is not known.|$|E

2500|$|The New Zealand wrens [...] are {{a family}} (Acanthisittidae) of tiny passerines endemic to New Zealand. They were {{represented}} by six known species in {{four or five}} genera, although only two species survive in two genera today. They are understood to form a distinct lineage within the passerines, but authorities differ on their assignment to the oscines or suboscines (the two suborders that between them make up the <b>Passeriformes).</b> More recent studies suggest that they form a third, most ancient, suborder Acanthisitti and have no living close relatives at all. They are called [...] "wrens" [...] due to similarities in appearance and behaviour to the true wrens (Troglodytidae), but are not members of that family.|$|E
2500|$|The tanagers (singular [...] ) {{comprise}} the bird family Thraupidae, {{in the order}} <b>Passeriformes.</b> The family has an American distribution. The Thraupidae are the second-largest family of birds and represent about 4% of all avian species and 12% of the Neotropical birds. Traditionally, about 240 species of tanagers have been described, but the taxonomic treatment of this family's members is currently {{in a state of}} flux. As more of these birds are studied using modern molecular techniques, some genera are expected to be relocated elsewhere. Already, species in the genera Euphonia and Chlorophonia, which were once considered part of the tanager family, are now treated as members of Fringillidae, in their own subfamily (Euphoniinae). Likewise, the genera Piranga (which includes the scarlet tanager, summer tanager, and western tanager), Chlorothraupis, and Habia appear to be members of the cardinal family, and have been reassigned to that family by the American Ornithologists' Union.|$|E
