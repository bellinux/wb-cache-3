5|$|Testaroli is {{sometimes}} served with <b>pesto</b> sauce, {{which is a}} common addition {{to it in the}} Liguria and Tuscany regions of Italy. Another dressing method includes the addition of olive oil, Pecorino cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano, garlic and basil. Significant amounts of sauce may absorb into testaroli.|$|E
5|$|Testaroli is {{prepared}} from a batter that is cooked {{on a hot}} flat surface, after which it may be consumed. It is traditionally cooked on a testo, a flat terra cotta or cast iron cooking surface from which the food's name is derived. It is sometimes cooked further in boiling water and then served. Testaroli is {{sometimes referred to as}} a bread, similar to focaccia in composition, and is sometimes referred to as a crêpe. It may be dressed with <b>pesto</b> sauce or other ingredients such as olive oil, Pecorino cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and garlic. Falsi testaroli al ragu is a similar dish prepared using sliced pasta dough and a ragù sauce.|$|E

Gene ends up using the bathroom at <b>Pesto's</b> and clogs the toilet leading to it overflowing and flooding the restaurant with sewage. At the end of the episode, we see that Sandy was also in a noodle commercial with the same catch phrase. We also see Bob's new commercial featuring his family.|$|R

25|$|Pasta is {{generally}} served with {{some type of}} sauce; the sauce {{and the type of}} pasta are usually matched based on consistency and ease of eating. Northern Italian cooking uses less tomato sauce, garlic and herbs. In Northern Italy white sauce is more common. However Italian cuisine is best identified by individual regions. Pasta dishes with lighter use of tomato are found in Trentino-Alto Adige and Emilia Romagna. In Bologna, the meat-based Bolognese sauce incorporates a small amount of tomato concentrate and a green sauce called <b>pesto</b> originates from Genoa. In Central Italy, there are sauces such as tomato sauce, amatriciana, arrabbiata and the egg-based carbonara.|$|E
25|$|Pasta is {{generally}} a simple dish, but comes in many varieties {{due to its}} versatility. Some pasta dishes are served as a first course in Italy because the portion sizes are small and simple. Pasta is also prepared in light lunches, such as salads or large portion sizes for dinner. It can be prepared by hand or food processor and served hot or cold. Pasta sauces vary in taste, color and texture. When choosing which type of pasta and sauce to serve together, {{there is a general}} rule regarding compatibility. Simple sauces like <b>pesto</b> are ideal for long and thin strands of pasta while tomato sauce combines well with thicker pastas. Thicker and chunkier sauces have the better ability to cling onto the holes and cuts of short, tubular, twisted pastas. The extra sauce left on the plate after all of the pasta is eaten is often mopped up with a piece of bread. Pasta is largely carbohydrates (mainly as starch), with moderate amounts of protein and manganese.|$|E

2500|$|Corrigan's [...] "error" [...] {{caught the}} {{imagination}} of the depressed American public and inspired many jokes. The nickname [...] "'Wrong Way' Corrigan" [...] passed into common use (sometimes confused with the memory of 1929's [...] "Wrong Way" [...] Riegels football incident) and is still mentioned (or used as satire) when someone has the reputation for taking the wrong direction. For example: Corrigan was directly referenced in the 1938 Three Stooges short Flat Foot Stooges. Curly states, [...] "Hey, we're doing a Corrigan!" [...] after realizing they are heading in the wrong direction to get to the fire they need to extinguish. A character named [...] "Wrong Way Feldman" [...] was portrayed by Hans Conreid in two episodes of Gilligan's Island in the 1960s. Also, in the short 'Birds on a Wire', part of the last episode (1998) of Animaniacs, <b>Pesto</b> the Goodfeather pigeon expresses outrage by exclaiming [...] "Are you saying that I don't know my directions?

However, a fully clothed Hugo enters the restaurant, saying {{that he wants to}} be the one to someday close down the restaurant; until he does, Bob’s Burgers will stay open.

5000|$|Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a A-, saying, [...] "'Can’t Buy Me Math' {{is a classic}} Bob’s Burgers episode, one in which I don’t even need to mention Bob’s climactic striptease to get across its general brilliance. But still: Bob’s striptease! Once again, chaos reigns over the show, as the admittedly limited sexiness of Bob’s dancing is enough to revolt the patrons at Jimmy <b>Pesto’s</b> and the {{assorted}} passersby (which of course includes Edith). That scene nails down the general brilliance of the Bob’s Burgers approach, as the situation once again spirals out of control, {{to the point that}} even a simple act as closing the curtains feels like a cosmic impossibility." ...|$|R
50|$|Bob {{finishes}} {{making his}} burger only {{to realize that}} his family went to Jimmy <b>Pesto's.</b> Bob goes over, wearing Gene's burger suit with the burgers as samples.

Mr. Fischoeder arrives after Bob and Jimmy have stopped fighting, and he lets them and the others go to Bob's Burgers to get the rent. Bob claims {{that he does not}} have the rent money, so Mr. Fischoeder announces the restaurant lease will not be renewed. However, as he is doing so, he smells the Meatsiah burgers and tastes them. Mr. Fischoeder realizes that Bob does not care about high-volume business, but rather, cares about the quality of his food, so he lets the restaurant lease be extended under some circumstances.|$|R

It’s a {{reliably}} funny, charming episode that builds to a terrific crescendo, with the kids’ storefront concert actually bringing together usual Belcher nemeses like Edith and Jimmy <b>Pesto’s</b> lackey Trev {{in support of the}} kids. Taken with the reprise of “Burgers And Fries” over the closing credits, it all adds up to a fine reaffirmation that Bob’s Burgers just doing what comes naturally represents one of the most enjoyable half-hours on TV." [...] The episode received a 0.9 rating and was watched by a total of 2.04 million people.

[...] Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10, saying [...] "So, while it’s charming and funny to see the Belchers trying to make a commercial to air on Super Bowl Sunday in hopes of roping customers away from <b>Pesto’s,</b> you know from the get-go that it’s going to be a failed endeavor.

Which is a great plan, until it means that Louise sets him up on a hot mortician's date and gets all the adults out of the building to explore the morgue. Hilarity most definitely ensues. It's not deep, and it's not quite as delirious as “Art Crawl”, but gags like Jimmy <b>Pesto's</b> Jamaican night are consistent winners. I think episodes like this are Bob's Burgers' baseline moving forward - weird, funny, and occasional springboards to episodes of sheer genius." ...|$|R
