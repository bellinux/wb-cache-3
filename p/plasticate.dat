40|$|The work {{is devoted}} to the {{analysis}} and development of effective types of plasticizers {{for a wide range of}} finishing (linoleum) and insulating building materials (insulation tape, cable plastic) with improved mechanical and technical characteristics. In connection with the growth of consumption of finishing and insulating materials, the development of new formulations of PVC compositions for construction with the use of new plasticizers is not only an urgent task, but also within the framework of construction it allows solving the problems of effective quality control of a finished PVC composition. This paper presents the results of the tests of ctylphenoxyethylphtalates as a new chemical additivies for plasticizing PVC in the formulation of the upper and middle layers of linoleum, adhesive film and cable compound О- 40 rec. ОМ- 40 (black). It is noted, that obtained samples of adhesive tape with their main characteristics (tensile strength at break, extension coefficient, shatter point, thermostability) correspond to technical specification (TS) 2245 - 001 - 00203312 - 2003. Obtained samples of <b>plasticate</b> were analyzed according to GOST 5960 - 72 rev. 1 - 9 (PVC <b>plasticate</b> for isolation and protective covers of wires and cables), by main characteristics (specific insulation resistance, tensile strength at break, breaking elongation, shatter point) are not inferior to commercial prototypes, and such characteristics as «Weight loss at 160 о С» and «Water absorption» are significantly lower. It is noted that, in case of using octylphenoxyethyl phtalates, obtained samples of films of upper and middle layers of linoleum analyzed according to norms of STI 00203312 - 100 - 2006 have a higher melt flow rate.

40|$|The {{possibilities}} {{to increase}} the static conductivity of PVC compared to the initial antistatic level, for PVC <b>plasticate</b> obtained with effective plasticizer - a so called modifier of type A, and partial thermal dehydrochlorination for formation of a copolymer with a system of conjugated double bonds are investigated. To analyze the dependence of electrical conductivity from double conjugated bonds the doping method is proposed, in which a chemically active dopant is embedded between two thin films of the polymer sample, not touching, and, accordingly, not interacting with the metal electrodes. In this scheme it is found, that the for folding of two layers of partly dehydrochlorinated PVC {{on the border between}} them the barrier layer is formed, which can be eliminated by doping with iodine giving significant increase in electrical conductivity. This layer does not arise in the case of type A modifier plasticized PVC. The presence of such layer can be interpreted {{as a sign of the}} near-surface spatial heterogeneity associated with the presence of conduction mechanism of double conjugated bonds.

40|$|Abstract: Polymer vane {{extruder}} is a {{new type}} of extrusion machine, whose <b>plasticating</b> and conveying method is based on elongational rheology. The vane extruder has many advantages over conventional <b>plasticating</b> method, such as shortening thermo-mechanical experience of <b>plasticating</b> and conveying, reducing the energy consumption of <b>plasticating</b> and conveying, and improving adaptability to diverse materials. Currently, research for characteristics of vane extruder is mostly focused on theoretical derivation and experiments. However, these methods lead to high consumption of time and energy, and cannot provide an intuitive view of the flow. In this paper, 3 D finite element numerical simulation was performed to investigate the flow in one of the vane units with POLYFLOW. The elongation flow was investigated by analyzing velocity field, pressure field, local-shear-rate distribution and mixing index distribution. The results show that numerical simulation is an efficient method to optimize process parameters and the structure of vane extruder...|$|R

The screws used are three zone screws with different compression ratios, screws with pineapple or Maddock/Egan mixing elements, {{with one or two}} channel barrier sections, with static mixers mounted in the valve or in the nozzle, or with combinations of these different elements. The best mixing quality is obtained with multi-channel Maddock sections. The highest <b>plasticating</b> capacity and, consequently, the shortest cycle times are achieved with the barrier screws.

The <b>plasticating</b> process in single screw polymer extrusion is one of the areas where this research can help to increase the existing knowledge.

Two boundary conditions are considered: a) open-discharge, implying that no compaction of the solids occurs and b) close-discharge, leading to a pressure increase.

40|$|International audienceTo be able {{to predict}} the {{throughput}} of a single-screw extruder or the metering time of an injection moulding machine for a given screw geometry, set of processing conditions and polymeric material is important both for practical and designing purposes. The model is based on viewing the entire screw simply as a pump, conveying a solid and a molten fraction. The evolution of the solid fraction {{is the essence of}} the plastication process, but under a particular hypothesis on solid bed acceleration, its influence on the throughput is nil. This allows getting a good estimate on the throughput and pressure development along the screw. Calculations are compared to a large set of experiments available from the literature. Consistent agreement with these published results is obtained, both for throughput and pressure along the screw. The effect of the <b>plasticating</b> process on the throughput is non-existent if the plastication length is short, and more visible if the plastication length takes {{a good part of the}} screw length (for instance, at higher screw rotation frequency). This diminishes the throughput value and widens the pressure peak.

40|$|Owing to {{the higher}} {{requirements}} on dosage accuracy and material strength for products with microfeatures, {{the analysis of the}} solid conveying process in a microinjection moulding machine becomes more important. A discrete element modelling method discrete element modelling (DEM) for simulating polymer particles moving in an inclined narrow screw channel is developed. Adhesion and its effects on normal contact force and rolling friction are taken into account in the modelling, allowing considerations of more influencing factors on the solid conveying process, such as temperature. The straight gravity field in the real world is transformed into the twisted time dependent gravity field in an unfolded straight channel, avoiding the calculation expensiveness induced by the complex geometry of the screw channel, which is important for DEM simulations. These have not been carried out previously. Using the developed programmes, effects of screw axis inclination on the specific throughput of the solid pellets are investigated. It is found that a larger inclination angle can induce higher specific throughput, especially when the screw rotational speed is lower. However, a smaller inclination angle is beneficial for easier throughput control. The results can be used to optimise the design of the <b>plasticating</b> unit as well as the operation parameters of the microinjection moulding machine.

Current practices are reviewed and the need for a unifying framework to identify and strengthen the underlying core principles is postulated. Intelligent control is redefined to make explicit use of human systems in control as a reference model. Psychological theories of intelligent behaviour reveal certain basic attributes. From these a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for intelligent control are derived. Learning ability is identified as a crucial element. Necessary attributes for learning are prediction capabilities, internal world model, estimation of the model parameters, and active probing to reduce uncertainties. This framewoik is used to define a Learning Based Predictive Control (LBPC) strategy. LBPC is derived from Predictive Functional Control techniques with an adaptive layer implemented by recursive least squares. Improved performance above conventional adaptive control is demonstrated.
