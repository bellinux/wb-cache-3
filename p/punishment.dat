It is only in the epilogue that he realizes his formal <b>punishment,</b> having decided to confess and end his alienation from society.|$|E

40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis {{is the issue}} of {{physical}} <b>punishments</b> in the Czech Republic. This topic is still very serious, often discussed, timeless and unresolved. Physical <b>punishments</b> are still extensively used as an educational tool in the Czech Republic. This demonstrates the tolerance of our society to accept physical <b>punishments</b> or the fear of adopting a law that would prohibit the use of physical <b>punishments.</b> The current situation has been mapped by the use of surveys, opinions and views of students and their awareness regarding alternative ways of upbringing. All research questions were fully saturated and the conclusions of the investigation came up as expected. It {{is not surprising that the}} results of the study point to the harmfulness of physical <b>punishments,</b> which were confirmed earlier in analogous researches. It is not even startling that relatively large number of respondents, who described their own experience with physical <b>punishments</b> during their lifetime in various degree. This phenomenon is attributed to the low awareness of the older generation, which transmits it´s experiences from the time long gone. The outcome of the survey and the attitude of students to physical <b>punishments</b> can be described as interesting or even surprising. Most of the respondents said that they will apply physical <b>punishments</b> during of their childrens upbringing. The cause is considered to their own experience with moderate physical <b>punishments</b> and these practices which carried to the next generation. The surveyed respondents, who stated that they will not use physical <b>punishments,</b> have their own experiences with a higher intensity of physical <b>punishments.</b> However, the intensity of physical <b>punishments</b> didn't reach such high level that this could pathologically affect the structure of the personality. These partners tend to avoid physical <b>punishments</b> all together. It would emerge as an aggressive and violent behaviour in the case of pathological manifestations that would be considered by them as standard norm of upbringing...|$|R
5|$|The {{concept for}} Eternal <b>Punishment</b> {{emerged during the}} writing for Persona 2: Innocent Sin. Halfway through writing the latter's script, Tadashi Satomi felt that the draft gave him the {{impression}} of needing an alternate point of view {{to that of the}} main hero. This concept formed the basis for Eternal Punishments plot. To foreshadow this, the team showed the main characters from Eternal <b>Punishment</b> through minor roles in Innocent Sin. Eternal <b>Punishment</b> began full development after the release of Innocent Sin. Innocent Sin and Eternal <b>Punishment</b> both used the same game engine and structure. Kouji Okada, Innocent Sins producer, returned in the same role. When developing Eternal <b>Punishment,</b> the development team took what they learned from Innocent Sin and used it to improve the gameplay and the Rumor system. One of the biggest concerns when making Eternal <b>Punishment</b> was how much the development staff wanted to include, which went well beyond their original plans.|$|E

5|$|According to Cloud {{and other}} modern {{professional}} historians of Roman history, {{a fundamental shift}} in the <b>punishment</b> of murderers may have occurred {{towards the end of}} the third century BCE, possibly spurred on by specific incidents like that of Lucius Hostius' murder of his father, and, more generally, occasioned by the concomitant brutalization of society in the wake of the protracted wars with Hannibal. Previously, murderers would have been handed over to the family of the victim to exact their vengeance, whereas from the second century BCE and onwards, the <b>punishment</b> of murderers became the affair of the Roman state, rather than, that is, that the offended family was given full licence in how to mete out what they deemed to be an appropriate <b>punishment</b> to the murderer of a family member. Within that particular context, Cloud points out, specifically, that certain jokes contained in the plays of the early 2nd century dramatist Plautus may be read to refer to the recent introduction of the <b>punishment</b> by the sack for parricides in particular (without the animals involved).|$|E

40|$|Economic Criminal Law in Nazi Germany adopted "Ordnungsstrafe," the {{administrative}} penalties for {{violation of the}} order that authorized {{the administrative}} agencies to impose criminal <b>punishments</b> without going through the criminal procedure.

Today, it is not permissible to impose criminal <b>punishments</b> without criminal procedure, in terms of separation of the powers and due process.

The research applies a qualitative study in one junior high school in Bandung. The data are taken from interviews, observations, and questionnaire. This study shows that kinds of rewards implemented by the teacher in English learning are verbal and tangible rewards, whereas for <b>punishments</b> are verbal, action, and penalty <b>punishments.</b> The students respond the implementation of rewards and <b>punishments</b> positively when it is delivered properly. The result shows that when rewards are applied appropriately, they can enhance students’ motivation. In addition, the implementation of <b>punishments</b> in proper way can also increase both students’ discipline and motivation in learning English. This study suggests that the appropriate application of rewards and <b>punishments</b> can be an alternative way that enhances students’ motivation.
