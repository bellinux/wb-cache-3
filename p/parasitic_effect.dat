40|$|Subject of Research. The paper proposes an {{original}} method {{for studying the}} <b>parasitic</b> <b>effects</b> in the electro-optic modulator of the fiber optic gyroscope. Proposed method {{is based on the}} usage of a special waveform phase modulation signal. Method. The essence of the proposed method lies in modification of serrodyne modulation signal, thereby providing a periodic displacement of the phase difference signal to the maximum of the interference curve. In this case, the intensity level reflects the influence of <b>parasitic</b> <b>effects</b> with the degree of manifestation being determined by the sequence of voltage control signals applied to the modulator. Enumeration of combinations of control signals and the corresponding intensity levels gives the possibility to observe an empirical dependence of the <b>parasitic</b> <b>effects</b> and use it later for compensation.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of <b>parasitic</b> <b>effects</b> {{is essential to}} maximize {{the performance of a}} Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC). Using a circuit simulator, we are able to model mode conversion at the interface between straight and bent waveguides, parasitic reflections in multi-mode interference couplers (MMIs), interference between multiple modes, residual facet reflections, and reflections at junctions between components. Even though these effects are usually low in intensity, around - 20 dB to - 30 dB from the main signal level, they can still have a strong influence on the circuit performance. This is because the mentioned <b>parasitic</b> <b>effects</b> are coherent with the desired signal and interference between them is therefore a field effect. By analyzing three different circuits, and comparing the results to measurements, we show that these effects need to be carefully managed in order to ensure circuit performance. The circuits we investigate are a Fabry-Perot cavity, a Mach- Zehnder interferometric structure, and a Michelson interferometer. Especially residual reflections coming from angled facets and back-reflections in MMIs are shown to be the main <b>parasitic</b> <b>effects</b> in the investigated circuits. © (2013) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).
