5|$|Squab pie is a mutton <b>pie</b> <b>with</b> a shortcrust pastry lid. It {{should be}} made {{with at least one}} layer of onions, {{followed}} by alternating layers of sliced apples and mutton chops.

5|$|When Marge and the {{children}} arrive at El Chemistri, Homer unknowingly arrives at an illegal meth lab that he thinks is the actual restaurant. While the trio eat their meal (deconstructed Caesar salad) with other foodies, Marge feels guilty about misdirecting Homer. Meanwhile, Homer meets the meth dealer and other drug addicts, whom he believes to be food hipsters. Just as {{he is about to}} have a taste of the meth (which he thinks is food produced with the help of molecular gastronomy), the police burst in and a gunfight ensues between them and the drug addicts. At El Chemistri, Marge receives a panicked text message from Homer requesting help, and she asks the other foodies to help save her husband. They refuse, so she, Bart, and Lisa head by themselves towards the meth lab after receiving doggie bags from the chef who is angry that they are leaving. After arriving, Marge throws apple pie from her doggie bag into the mouth of the meth dealer. This causes a flashback inside his mind to his childhood days when his mother used to make apple <b>pie.</b> <b>With</b> the help of this distraction, the police subdue him. After Marge apologizes to Homer, they and their children decide to have fun together as a whole family from now on.|$|E

50|$|In July 2010, Mansfield 103.2 revived a 70-year-old Mansfield Tradition of a Gooseberry Pork Pie. Years ago in Mansfield, {{the town}} would {{celebrate}} {{with a giant}} Pork <b>Pie</b> filled <b>with</b> Gooseberrys. The <b>pie</b> wasn't made {{since the end of}} the second world war, but in July 2010 The Breakfast Show brought back the tradition, by creating a batch of small gooseberry filled <b>pies</b> <b>with</b> the help of local butchers.|$|R

50|$|Whilst {{the filling}} of the Pithivier {{is often a}} sweet frangipane of almond paste (optionally {{combined}} with fruit such as cherry or plum), savoury <b>pies</b> <b>with</b> a meat or cheese filling can also be labelled as a Pithivier.|$|R
50|$|The {{favorite}} dish was a layered <b>pie</b> stuffed <b>with</b> sheep's milk {{cheese and}} soaked {{with sour cream}} before baking. Other delicacies were <b>pies</b> <b>with</b> crumbled pumpkin and sweet <b>pies</b> made <b>with</b> the first milk of a cow that had just calved. The traditional ritual dish called kurban combined bulgar wheat porridge with a slaughtered (or sacrificed) ram and is {{further evidence of the}} origins of the Gagauz in both the Balkan world and the steppe-pastoral complex. Peppered meat sauces are especially important: one combines onion and finely granulated porridge, while another is tomato-based. A red house wine is served with dinner and supper. Head cheese is an indispensable component of holiday meals.|$|R
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{proposed}} strategies for reducing the federal deficit. These may include policy choices regarding taxation and spending, along with policies designed to increase economic growth and reduce unemployment. For example, a fast-growing economy offers the win-win outcome of a larger proverbial economic <b>pie,</b> <b>with</b> higher employment and tax revenues, lower safety net spending and a lower debt-to-GDP ratio. However, most other strategies represent a tradeoff scenario in which money or benefits are taken from some and given to others. Spending can be reduced from current levels, frozen, or the rate of future spending increases reduced. Budgetary rules can also be implemented to manage spending. Some changes can take place today, while others can phase in over time. Tax revenues can be raised in a variety of ways, by raising tax rates, the scope of what is taxed, or eliminating deductions and exemptions ("tax expenditures"). Regulatory uncertainty or barriers can be reduced, as these may cause businesses to postpone investment and hiring decisions.|$|E

500|$|Up to World War I, cakes, {{including}} plum cakes, were baked {{along with}} loaves of bread. [...] "A smaller cake or pasty might be slipped in or pulled {{out after the}} baking had begun, but a raised <b>pie</b> <b>with</b> well-protected sides, or a large plum cake, would take at least {{the same time as}} the loaves, and experienced housewives made them in sizes to do so." ...|$|E
50|$|Pot <b>pies</b> <b>with</b> a flaky {{crust and}} bottom {{are also a}} popular American dish, {{typically}} with a filling of meat (particularly beef, chicken, or turkey), gravy, and mixed vegetables (potatoes, carrots, and peas). Frozen pot pies are often sold in individual serving size.|$|R

Complications arise when Duchess tries to replace Ribby's mouse <b>pie</b> <b>with</b> her own veal and ham pie, and then believes she has swallowed a small tin pastry form called a patty-pan. Its themes are etiquette and social relations in a small town.|$|E

According to Touré of The New York Times in 1994, Wallace's lyrics [...] " [...] autobiographical details about crime and violence with emotional honesty". Marriott of The New York Times (in 1997) believed his lyrics were not strictly autobiographical and wrote he [...] "had a knack for exaggeration that increased sales". Wallace described his debut as [...] "a big <b>pie,</b> <b>with</b> each slice indicating a different {{point in my life}} involving bitches and niggaz... from the beginning to the end".|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{buildings at}} Watford Gap {{were designed by}} Harry W Weedon and Partners, already well known for their work for Odeon Cinemas. The restaurant opened in September 1960, but the Ministry were unhappy about the services' reputation as a truck-stop, dating back to Blue Boar's popularity with HGV drivers. They consequently redesigned the restaurant in 1964 to accommodate a waitress service, which they hoped would [...] "lose {{at least some of}} the stigma of having been started in 1959 as primarily a commercial driver's facility". Food was criticised for being expensive, though Tam Galbraith disputed this, noting he could buy steak and kidney <b>pie</b> <b>with</b> chips, buttered roll and a cup of tea at Watford Gap for 4s 2d (£ today).|$|E

2500|$|Among the [...] "firsts" [...] by Marshall Field's was {{the concept}} of the {{department}} store tea room. In the 19th century, ladies shopping downtown returned home for lunch; having lunch at a downtown restaurant unescorted by a gentleman was not considered ladylike. But after a Marshall Field's clerk shared her lunch (a chicken pot <b>pie)</b> <b>with</b> a tired shopper, Field's hit on the idea of opening a department store tea room, so that women shoppers would not feel the need to make two trips to complete their shopping. To this day, the Walnut Room serves the traditional Mrs. Herring's chicken pot pie.|$|E

In a review of Dope's album Felons and Revolutionaries, NME said [...] "In American Pie, a boy puts his cock in an apple pie, to let us know that there's something rotten {{at the heart of the}} American Dream. Ex-con brothers Edsel and Simon Dope, though, would probably put someone else's cock in the apple pie, cut it off, lace the <b>pie</b> <b>with</b> strychnine, and serve it up at the Clinton dinner table." ...|$|E
