5|$|Built as the Mont Dore Hotel in 1881, Bournemouth Town Hall was {{designated}} a Grade II listed building in 2001. Designed by Alfred Bedborough in the French, Italian and neo-classical styles, the foundation stone was laid by King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway {{and the hotel}} opened in 1885. The buff brick exterior features Bath stone dressings and terracotta friezes. The main entrance is sited within a projected façade that reaches to the eaves and is topped with a pediment, while above sits a belvedere with turrets and a <b>pavilion</b> <b>roof.</b> During the First World War the hotel {{was used as a}} hospital for British and Indian soldiers and after as a convalescent home. It never opened as a hotel again and was purchased by Bournemouth Borough Council in 1919.|$|E
25|$|The {{octagonal}} pavilion supports an {{arched roof}} that is, in turn, surmounted by a clerestory and dome. The clerestory {{is supported by}} eight free-standing, wood-clad, cast-iron columns located within the rotunda and grouped in pairs. Projecting from the <b>pavilion</b> <b>roof</b> on the east, west, and south elevations are dormer windows with peak roofs. Between major arched structural framing members are wood muntins that hold the glass lights on their sides. The lights lap one over one another like shingles and follow {{the curve of the}} arches.|$|E
25|$|A short asphalt walkway, {{lined with}} white stones, leads from Mackenzie to the church's main {{entrance}} pavilion. It {{is joined by}} a narrower one, similarly treated, that comes in from the east, connecting to the unpaved parking lot the church shares with the commercial building next door. Surrounding the church is a planting bed, also lined with white stone. The church's sign stands in its lawn to the south; a stone marker protesting legalized abortion is in the western quadrant. Two mature black spruce grow to {{the height of the}} <b>pavilion</b> <b>roof</b> on its north side; another one grows {{at the end of the}} row of shrubs along the utilidor at the east corner of the lot.|$|E

5000|$|Pevsner {{compared}} the remodelled Marbury Hall with Wellington College, completed in 1859, describing it as [...] "quite a document of architectural history". The architecture mixed Louis XIII <b>pavilion</b> <b>roofs</b> and French dormers with {{parts in the}} Queen Anne style; there were turrets and a dome.|$|R
25|$|On 27 August, the Australians came to Hove and Bartlett hit 157 in two hours. He scored his 50 in 33 minutes, 100 in 57 {{minutes and}} 150 in 110 minutes. A pull off Frank Ward early on {{landed on the}} <b>pavilion</b> <b>roof.</b> Later he hit two fours and two sixes off {{successive}} balls from Ward in an over that went for 22 runs. The century won Bartlett the Lawrence trophy for the fastest hundred {{of the season and}} included six sixes and eleven fours. He scored 104 runs before lunch in just over an hour before slowing down. The fourth wicket partnership with James Langridge contributed 195 in 120 minutes – Bartlett 152, Langridge 39. The innings included six sixes and eighteen fours. Once again he fell to an extraordinary catch, this time by Sid Barnes low down at long on.|$|E
500|$|Place des Nations, {{where the}} opening and closing ceremonies were held remains, however in an {{abandoned}} and deteriorating state. The Jamaican, Tunisian and partial remains of the Korean <b>pavilion</b> (<b>roof</b> only) also survive, {{as well as the}} CIBC banking centre. In Cite du Havre the Expo Theatre, Administration and Fine Arts buildings remain. Other remaining structures include sculptures, lampposts and landscaping. [...] The Montreal Metro subway station Berri Uqam still has an original [...] "Man and His World" [...] welcome sign with logo above the pedestrian tunnel entrance to the Yellow Line. La Ronde survives, and since 2001 it has been leased to the New York amusement park company Six Flags.|$|E
500|$|Rod Pont (also {{known as}} Steve Day in Steve Day and the Drifters) remembered Storm {{arriving}} at the Orrell Park Ballroom for a concert with a boil on his face. When told about it, Storm pulled out a black velvet hood which had slits for his eyes and mouth, and played the whole concert with the hood on. At one concert at Bankfield House Youth club, Garston, Liverpool, in 1965, the stage lighting failed between sets. Storm was upset until someone walked in with a torch, which Storm used to finish the concert. He occasionally used a pet monkey {{in some of the}} group's performances, as it attracted more people. At a New Brighton swimming baths performance for 1,600 people in 1963, Storm climbed to the top diving board, undressed to a pair of swimming trunks, and then dived into the water {{at the end of a}} song. In January 1964, during a performance at the Majestic Ballroom, Birkenhead, he climbed up one of the columns supporting the balcony, but slipped and fell [...] to the floor below, fracturing his leg. At another performance on the New Brighton Pier, Storm made his way onto the <b>Pavilion</b> <b>roof</b> but fell through the glass skylight.|$|E

These panels are flanked by semi-octagonal towers crowned by two open octagonal pavilions. Red sandstone adorns the gate while the <b>pavilion</b> <b>roofs</b> are in white stone. Between the two pavilions is a screen of miniature chhatris with seven miniature marble domes. Flame-shaped battlements encompass the wall.|$|R
2500|$|Five {{home runs}} {{have been hit}} {{completely}} out of Dodger Stadium. [...] Outfielder Willie Stargell of the Pittsburgh Pirates hit two of those home runs. [...] Stargell hit a 507-foot home run off the Dodgers' Alan Foster on August 6, 1969 that completely cleared the right field pavilion and struck a bus parked outside the stadium. [...] Stargell then hit a 470-foot home run off Andy Messersmith on May 8, 1973 that landed on the right field <b>pavilion</b> <b>roof</b> and bounced into the parking lot. [...] Dodger catcher Mike Piazza hit a 478-foot home run off Frank Castillo of the Colorado Rockies on September 21, 1997 that landed on the left field <b>pavilion</b> <b>roof</b> and skipped under the left field video board and into the parking lot.

2500|$|The cricket writer Ray Robinson {{suggests}} that Scott's batting [...] "was noted for grit rather than gaiety" [...] {{but he did}} sometimes reveal an adventurous streak as shown when he landed a ball from A. G. Steel onto the <b>pavilion</b> <b>roof</b> at The Oval and by his assault on Saul Wade's bowling at Bramall Lane. In 1884, England found that Scott was the hardest man to bowl out in the Australian team.|$|E

50|$|In November 2011, Commonwealth Roofing gave an {{estimate}} of $35,895 to repair the <b>pavilions</b> <b>roof</b> which reflected a donation of the overhead and profit, {{as well as a}} portion of the labor. Included were Metro Parks approved high-end dimensioned asphalt shingles that would mimic the current wood shake, but have a longer warranty, require less maintenance, and last longer in the conditions present in the Ohio Valley.|$|R
500|$|The {{exterior}} is both structurally {{and visually}} Franco-American in style with little trace of English architecture, and is {{heavily influenced by}} the architectural traditions of Paris. The facade on the Piccadilly side is roughly , [...] on the Arlington Street side, and [...] on the Green Park side. At {{the corners of the}} <b>pavilion</b> <b>roofs</b> of the Ritz are large green copper lions, the emblem of the hotel. The Ritz has 111 rooms and 23 suites.|$|R
500|$|The {{steel frame}} of the {{building}} was made in Germany {{and is based on}} a model made in the early 1880s in Chicago to increase fire resistance. It was erected by Messrs Potts & Co. of Oxford Street. Fireproofing of the walls were conducted by the Columbian Fireproofing Company Ltd. of Pittsburgh and London, with steel-ribbed bars allowing for ventilation, while remaining sound proof and free from vibration. The internal walls consist of [...] "hollow, porous, terra-cotta blocks" [...] covered with plaster, and the hotel's flooring was also made fireproof. At the corners of the <b>pavilion</b> <b>roofs</b> of the Ritz are large green copper lions, the emblem of the hotel.|$|R
2500|$|The phases are: Phase 1, the {{restoration}} of the North Front and Colonnades, started in the summer of 2000 and completed in July 2002, much of the money coming from the Heritage Lottery Fund, English Heritage, the Getty Grant Programme and Shanks First Fund. Phase 2, {{the restoration}} of the Central Pavilion and South Portico, took place from July 2003 to July 2006, thanks to funding by an anonymous U.S. philanthropist; the interior of the Marble Saloon was also undertaken. Phase 3, {{the restoration of}} the South Front, commenced in the autumn of 2009 and has been divided into sub-phases A, The Large Library roof, facades and ceiling completed July 2010; B, The Eastern <b>Pavilion</b> <b>roof,</b> facades and garden, completed July 2010; C, The Western <b>Pavilion</b> <b>roof,</b> and facades; D, The State Dining room, roof, facades, ceiling and garden. If the funds can be raised it is hoped to complete Phase 3 in 2011 or 2012. Phase 4, {{the restoration of the}} West court and building range. Phase 5, the restoration of the Eastern court and building range. Phase 6, the restoration of the State Rooms (the Marble Saloon, Ante-Library [...] and Large Library have been restored, as were the Music Room and Egyptian Hall in 2012).|$|E
2500|$|Surrey made 1964 Barrington's Benefit {{year and}} {{with a variety of}} cricket and {{football}} matches, dances other fundraisers he made £10,702, the sixth highest earning benefit at the time, and enough money to buy a newly built four bedroom detached house in Feltham. Barrington's great friend Bobby Simpson led the Australian cricket team in England in 1964, strong in batting, but weak in bowling. The first two Tests were rain-soaked draws and they went to Headingley for the Third Test with Barrington having done little – his last 10 innings in England had produced 200 runs. Ted Dexter was back in charge and famously removed Fred Titmus from the attack just after he had taken 3 wickets. He gave the new ball to Fred Trueman who served up short-balls to Peter Burge who hooked and pulled his way to 160 to give Australia a 121 run lead in the first innings. England's reply depended heavily on Barrington who made 85 (the next highest score was 32) until he had an unlucky lbw decision and they were all out for 229. Australia easily made 111/3 to win and go 1–0 up in the series. The Fourth Test at Old Trafford saw Simpson winning the toss and making the first Test century of his career, 311 in Australia's 656/8. In reply Barrington made his first Test century in England and his highest Test score; 256 in 683 minutes with 26 fours and adding 246 for the third wicket with Dexter; [...] "It was a spirited reply that captured the imagination, but the inevitable draw meant that the Ashes stayed with Australia". It is the third highest score for England against Australia after Len Hutton's 364 and R.E. Foster's 287 and is the highest since the Second World War. Before he started his innings his wife had sent him a telegram Vincit qui patitur (he who endures conquers). He was lbw to McKenzie and England made 611, the first time that two teams had made 600 runs in an innings in the same Test. A few days later his smashed 83 in 27 minutes at Reading in one of his benefit matches, hitting 7 sixes, breaking the <b>pavilion</b> <b>roof</b> and followed this up with 207 against Nottinghamshire to give him back-to-back first-class double centuries. In the Fifth Test Trueman took his 300th Test wicket, Geoff Boycott made his maiden Test century and Barrington made 47 and 54 not out, but the rain guaranteed a draw and Australia won the series 1–0. Barrington made 531 runs (75.85) – more than anyone else on either side and only Simpson averaged higher with his 458 runs (76.33) – as he began the most fruitful period of his career.|$|E
