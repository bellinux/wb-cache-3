2500|$|The duty of {{care was}} codified in the Trustee Act 2000 section 1, as the [...] "care and skill that is reasonable" [...] to expect, {{regarding}} any special skills of the trustee. In practice this means that a trustee must be judged by what should be reasonably expected from another person in such a position of responsibility, being mindful not to judge decisions {{with the benefit of}} hindsight, and mindful of the inherent risk involved in any property management venture. As long ago as 1678, in Morley v Morley Lord Nottingham LC held that a trustee would not be liable if £40 of the trust fund's gold was robbed, so long as he otherwise performed his duties. Probably one of the main parts of the {{duty of care}}, in managing trust property, will relate to a trustee's investment choices. In Learoyd v Whiteley, Lindley LJ elaborated the general <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> <b>rule,</b> that in investments one must 'take such care as an ordinary prudent man would take if he were minded to make an investment for the benefit of other people for whom he felt morally bound to provide'. This meant a trustee who invested £5000 in mortgages of a brick field and four houses with a shop, and lost the lot when the businesses went insolvent, was liable for the losses on the brick field, whose value must have known to be bound to depreciate as bricks were taken out. Bartlett v Barclays Bank Trust Co Ltd suggests investments must be actively monitored, particularly by professional trustees. This duty was broken when the Barclays corporate trustee department, where trust assets held 99 per cent of a company's shares, failed to get any information or board representation before a disastrous property speculation. In making investments, TA 2000 section 4 requires that [...] "standard investment criteria" [...] must be observed, essentially along the lines of modern portfolio theory about diversification of investments to reduce risk. Section 5 suggests advice be sought on such matters if needed, but otherwise may invest anything that an ordinary property owner would. Additional restrictions, however, may be imposed depending on the how courts view the purpose of the trust, and the scope of a trustee's discretion.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the rationale, nature and financial consequences of two alternative approaches to portfolio regulations {{for the long-term}} institutional investor sectors life insurance and pension funds. These approaches are, respectively, <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> <b>rules</b> and quantitative portfolio restrictions. The argument draws on the financial-economics of investment, the differing characteristics of institutions’ liabilities, and the overall case for regulation of financial institutions. Among the conclusions are: · regulation of life insurance and pensions need not be identical; · <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> <b>rules</b> are superior to quantitative restrictions for pension funds except in certain specific circumstances (which may arise notably in emerging market economies), and; · although in general restrictions may be less damaging for life insurance than for pension funds, <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> <b>rules</b> may nevertheless be desirable in certain cases also for this sector, particularly in competitive life sectors in advanced countries, and for pension contracts offered by life insurance companies. These results have implications inter alia for an appropriate strategy of liberalisation. 1 The author is Professor of Economics and Finance, Brunel University, Uxbridge, Middlesex UB 3 4 PH, United Kingdom (e-mail ‘e_philip_davis@msn. com’, website: ‘www. geocities. com/e_philip_davis’).

40|$|In this article, {{the history}} of {{regulation}} in pensions in the United Kingdom is analysed, in particular with respect to defined benefit occupational pension schemes. A framework of criteria for effective legislation is developed. The original <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> <b>rule</b> provided a good framework for legislation, but most subsequent regulation that has been enacted does not meet our criteria. Recently regulation has increased the cost and risk of individual schemes and the systemic risk in {{the system as a}} whole. The article finds that, in totality, regulation has been disastrous for these schemes, contributing to their demise. The article concludes by briefly outlining how effective regulation might have developed to produce a flexible and resilient system. © 2012 The Authors. Economic Affairs...|$|E
40|$|Trusteed {{pension funds}} {{are one of}} the most {{important}} sources of retirement income for Canadians. They have also been one of the fastest-growing sectors of the Canadian financial market. Trusteed pension funds play an important role in capital markets, channelling billions of dollars of their members' contributions into investments in financial and real assets. This article presents an overview of the trusteed pension funds sector. It provides a context for this overview by briefly presenting other sources of retirement income in Canada. It then examines the sources of the sector's rapid growth, including regulatory developments that have affected it, namely the increase in allowable foreign content and the adoption of the <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> <b>rule.</b> Finally, it looks at the evolution of the sector's asset mix and how the sector interacts with capital markets. ...|$|E
40|$|Executive summary Pension fund {{assets in}} OECD {{countries}} have increased rapidly {{over the past}} decades (OECD 2007 a), and {{it is evident that}} such trend will continue. Against this background the issue of how to invest such a large amount of assets has become increasingly important, and also has policy implications. Broadly speaking pension funds around the globe have been subject to two approaches, i. e. quantitative asset restrictions (QAR) and the <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> <b>rule</b> (PPR). In this paper we first review how pension funds are regulated in both OECD and non-OECD countries. Next, the existing regulatory framework of funded pensions in China is reviewed (consisting of the mandatory personal account and Enterprise Annuities- i. e. voluntary occupational pensions). Finally, we conduct a simple empirical study, investigating quantitatively the extent to which potential benefits could be achieved if the current QAR approach in China is shifted towards a more liberalised regulatory approach. Given our empirical results which support the PPR in China, a number of policy recommendations are proposed in order to strengthen the existing pension regulations. They include a removal of lower limits on certain asset classes, consideration of allowing pension assets to be invested abroad etc...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} Canadian pension funds relative to those from the UK and US, {{in the light of}} the ongoing quantitative asset restrictions that still apply in Canada, compared with the purer <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> approach in the UK and US. We find that although Canadian funds often obtain better combinations of return and risk, returns are often less than could be obtained given financial market conditions, as shown by dummy portfolios split evenly between bonds and equities, or diversified into real estate, as well as mean-variance optimal portfolios. In contrast, UK and US funds typically outperform such benchmarks. Combined with criticisms of specific Canadian regulations in the light of finance theory and empirical evidence, the paper makes a case for removal of residual quantitative restrictions in Canada, and their replacement by sole <b>prudent</b> <b>person</b> regulations...|$|R
