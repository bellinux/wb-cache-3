25|$|Memorabilia are {{singular}} objects {{which are}} passed {{down through the}} family with the stories and memories about events or individuals attached to them. In one family a doll, given once as a Christmas present, continued to be brought out each year to celebrate Christmas and have her <b>picture</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> the (changing) family. For her hundredth birthday, a birthday cake for the doll {{was included in the}} Christmas celebration. Like the doll, almost any object imbued with family stories and memories can become a family heirloom. As such, it holds in the family a value often unrelated to its monetary value. As the stories and memories enveloping the object are slowly lost, the object itself becomes a simple hand-me-down, usually in poor condition and ready to be discarded.|$|E

That same year Price appeared as himself in Mooch Goes to Hollywood, a film written by Jim Backus. Price was an admirer of the works of Edgar Allan Poe and in 1975 visited the Edgar Allan Poe Museum (Richmond, Virginia), where he had his <b>picture</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> the museum's popular stuffed raven. Price recorded dramatic readings of Edgar Allan Poe's short stories and poems, which were collected together with readings by Basil Rathbone. In 1975, Price and his wife Coral Browne appeared together in an international stage adaptation of Ardèle which played in the USA as well as in London at the Queen's Theatre. During this run, Browne & Price starred together in a BBC Radio play Night of the Wolf first airing in 1975.|$|E

After the photograph was published in newspapers across the United States, Hartnett received a telegram from Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis instructing him not to have his photograph taken with Capone in the future. Hartnett replied with a telegram to the Commissioner whimsically stating, [...] "OK, but if you don't want me to have my <b>picture</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> Al Capone, you tell him." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's music video, {{directed}} by Dave Meyers, follows {{the theme of}} the lyrics. It shows the band on a tour bus, stopping at a party at Club Poonani. The members separate when three girls approach the male band members. Kanal has his <b>picture</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> several women, paying for it by taking money that drummer Adrian Young earns by hanging from gymnastics rings naked. Dumont defeats a woman, portrayed by Sonya Eddy, in an endurance drinking game, and Stefani dances, eventually joining Bounty Killer on stage.

Today the word fluoroscopy is widely understood to be a hypernym of all the aforementioned terms, which explains why {{it is the most}} commonly used and why the others are declining in usage. The newest term is four-dimensional CT (4D CT). As CT-generated video imagery, 4D CT is the newest form of moving <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> X-rays.

500|$|It is {{tradition}} for some alumni and other Spartan fans {{to have a}} <b>picture</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> the Spartan statue to mark major life events. During graduation season there is {{a steady stream of}} recent graduates and their families posing with the statue. On weekends {{it is not uncommon to}} see newlywed couples doing the same. During the week before the annual football game against the University of Michigan Wolverines, members of the marching band take turns each guarding the statue against vandalism by fans of the rival school. The tradition is known as [...] "Sparty Watch"; a similar vigil takes place at the Michigan Diag, where the inlaid [...] "M" [...] is defended against MSU fans. During the full team walk from Kellogg Center to Spartan Stadium that takes place prior to each home football game, players and coaches toss or place pennies at the statue as they proceed past it. [...] After the final home football game the Spartan Marching Band circles the statue once before heading home to Adams Field.|$|E
500|$|Storm and the Hurricanes {{performed}} at the Liverpool Stadium on 3 May 1960, on the same bill as Gene Vincent. Larry Parnes {{became interested in the}} Hurricanes, and invited them to audition at the Wyvern Club as a backing group for Billy Fury. Storm turned up at the audition, but only so he could have his <b>picture</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> Fury. In July 1960, the group secured a residency at Butlins holiday camp in Pwllheli (playing in the Rock 'n' Calypso Ballroom) for £25 each per week (equivalent to £ in [...] ). Starr was not sure about giving up his job as an apprentice at Henry Hunt's, where he made climbing frames for schools, until Storm put forward the idea of [...] "Starr-time" [...] (a solo spot) with Starr singing songs like [...] "Boys" [...] by the Shirelles.

30|$|Stereoscopy is a {{technique}} which produces a three-dimensional image of palatal rugae morphology. The principle is the comparison of two <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> the same device but in different angles (Mahajan et al., 2014).|$|R
50|$|Because {{the size}} of objects is {{increased}} {{in proportion to the}} enhanced depth, there is no miniaturization effect as with hyperstereo, but the same telephoto compression seen in extreme zoom flat photographs also occurs. Specifically, there is a reduction in the relative sizes of objects at different distances so that objects that are further away appear to be larger than closer objects that are actually the same size. Note that this effect is negligible at lower zoom levels and most observers cannot distinguish between telephoto <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> wide base and normal <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> a normal base at an equivalent distance. So <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> at 40 feet with a 4x zoom and a 10-inch base will appear similar to <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> at 10 feet with no zoom and a 2.5-inch base.|$|R

And Fort Collins is the home to the Clydesdales West Coast Team. When the horses are not touring, they can be seen as part of a tour and visitors can have a <b>picture</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> them. There are ten horses that travel on each team. [...] Eight are in harness when performing at any one time and the other two horses provide alternates for the hitch as needed. Several professional handlers accompany each team. Often, one handler has night duty to provide round-the-clock care for the horses. Transportation for each hitch requires three 50-foot semis. Two carry the horses, the third transports a red, white and gold beer wagon and other equipment. The horses' comfort is enhanced with air-cushion suspension and thick rubber flooring, and cameras in the trailers enable the drivers to watch the horses during transport. The team stops each night at local stables.|$|E

[...] A few minutes later, Nancy Pelosi arrived and photos of a ceremonial reenactment oath were taken. There were so many of Ellison’s family in attendance that the ceremony was done in two takes.

Clida Ellison noted that she is a practicing Roman Catholic who goes to Mass every day. Ellison expressed his satisfaction that the controversy was behind him, [...] "It was good, we did it, it's over, and now it's time to get down to business...maybe we don't have to talk about it so much anymore. Not that I'm complaining, but the pressing issues the country is facing are just a little bit more on my mind right now." ...|$|E
