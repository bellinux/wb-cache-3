40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{modeling}} issue of the nearfield coupling of an unshielded twisted-wire pair on a nearby single wire. It introduces {{a discussion about the}} appropriate modeling method for predicting the induced current on the victim wire and proposes a cost-effective approach to deal with either ideal or nonideal <b>twisted</b> <b>pair.</b> A nonideal <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> consists of a <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> whose ends are left untwisted for connection to equipment. We show that the current distribution may follow a specific spatial distribution on the nearby wire. These coupling effects are evidenced through the analysis of an equivalent circuit under the low-frequency assumption. These behaviors are illustrated for the case of both an ideal <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> and a nonideal <b>twisted</b> <b>pair.</b> For the latter, the ideal bifilar helix may be modeled by a simple equivalent model bifilar cable...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedDean vortices in curved channels with 40 to 1 aspect ratios were measured and studied {{over the range}} of Dean numbers from 50 to 450. At low Dean numbers (50) the flow is fully laminar. At higher Dean numbers, the development of vortex pairs as the primary instability was a function of Dean number and the angle of curvature. Higher Dean numbers required less curvature to produce the vortices. At Dean numbers from 75 to 200, secondary instabilities developed {{in the form of}} vortex pair modulations, vortex <b>pair</b> <b>twisting,</b> and in the form of events where vortex pair undulations, vortex <b>pair</b> <b>twisting,</b> and in the form of events where vortex pairs appear and disappear. The secondary instabilities are also a function of Dean number and curvature. Twisting leads to increase in longitudinal fluctuating intensities, particularly in the upwash region from the concave wall, which are especially significant at Dean numbers above 150.
