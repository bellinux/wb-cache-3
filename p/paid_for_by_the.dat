40|$|This paper {{takes an}} {{additional}} step toward analyzing {{the demand for}} insurance {{in the context of}} a portfolio model. An investor is endowed with a portfolio containing a risky and riskless asset that can be augmented by purchasing insurance. Here, insurance is <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>by</b> reducing <b>the</b> quantity of the risky insurable asset, holding the quantity of the riskless asset fixed. In the standard insurance demand model, insurance is <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>by</b> reducing <b>the</b> amount of the riskless asset. This distinction leads to a different insurance demand function because the opportunity cost of purchasing insurance is now random.
