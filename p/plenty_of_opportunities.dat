5|$|There are <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> in {{the county}} for hiking, observing {{wildlife}} and admiring the scenery. These include Brechfa Forest, the Pembrey Country Park, the Millennium Coastal Park at Llanelli, the WWT Llanelli Wetlands Centre and the Carmel National Nature Reserve.

25|$|Much of the Kandy Kingdom's {{territory}} {{was located}} in Sri Lanka's mountainous and thickly forested interior, with mountain passes to the capital providing <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> for defenders to stage ambushes. Routes to the city were kept secret, and spreading information concerning them could often result in death. Many routes into the hill country became impassable during the annual monsoon, and malaria was rife. Throughout its existence Kandyan forces used the land to their advantage, engaging in guerrilla warfare against invading forces, and evacuating major urban centres when enemy forces drew near – a tactic used with particular effect during the Kandyan Wars. Though the kingdom had intermittent access to the port of Batticaloa it had no naval forces and could not prevent the Portuguese and Dutch maintaining a strong presence in lowland areas.|$|E

25|$|Prisoners {{were able}} to buy a small range of {{provisions}} from their captors at Japanese prices, which escalated as the war went on. Black marketeering was sometimes tolerated by the guards, as they themselves were involved in the buying or exchanging of goods, and at other times punished severely. Although {{contact with the outside world}} was forbidden, there were <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> to communicate with the locals. Firewood-gathering gangs in the jungle {{were able to}} make contact and arrange purchases when the guards were not paying attention; at other times these transactions were permitted with the permission of and in the presence of a lenient Japanese guard. Gold, in the form of rings and jewellery, and British pounds were in demand by the Japanese guards. Such was the desperation of the prisoners towards the end of their internment that two soldiers disinterred a recently buried body in order to retrieve the dead man's wedding ring.|$|E
500|$|At {{some point}} – Professor J. S. Roskell has {{suggested}} due to [...] "a bellicose engagement" [...] – Stafford lost {{a hand and}} used a prosthesis; the antiquarian William Dugdale later called him [...] "Humphrey Stafford with the Silver Hand." [...] Although the date of this occurrence is unknown, he was an active soldier {{at the turn of}} the fifteenth century; there were, therefore, <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> for him to have lost a limb. He served as a Lancer for the Earl of Stafford, and in January 1400 he joined his uncle Ralph Stafford in suppressing the Epiphany Rising against the new king, King Henry IV. He took part in the English invasion of Scotland later that summer, and by 1403 had been retained by the Prince of Wales. Present at the Battle of Shrewsbury, he fought with the Prince in a party of 'four esquires and 100 archers.' Possibly as a result of this service, he was granted an annuity by Henry in 1406, and Humphrey continued serving Henry in Wales in the long campaign against Owain Glyndŵr's rebellion, for instance taking part in the siege of Aberystwyth in 1407. Most recently it has been suggested that it was in Henry's Welsh service – possibly at this siege – that he lost his hand, and replaced it [...] "with an artificial one made out of silver".|$|E
