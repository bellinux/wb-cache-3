Absorption and desorption experiments are also possible. The new apparatus {{consists of two}} vacuum chambers, an upstream chamber and a downstream chamber, separated by a specimen membrane. Both chambers are evacuated by turbo-molecular pumps and sputter-ion pumps. The upstream chamber is equipped with Ta filaments serving as atomizers in atom-driven <b>permeation</b> <b>experiments</b> and cathodes in plasma-driven <b>permeation</b> <b>experiments.</b> The specimen membrane is formed into a tubular and electrically isolated from the chamber. Hence, ohmic heating of the membrane is possible, and this feature of the membrane is suitable for surface cleaning by high-temperature heating and impurity doping for the control of surface chemical composition through surface segregation. Both chambers were evacuated to 1 x 10 - 7 Pa after baking. The main component of residual gas was H 2, and the partial pressures of impurity gases other than H 2 were ca. 1 x 10 - 8 Pa.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine the amount of terbinafine, which permeates through the human nail plate, from liquid formulations containing enhancers, namely hydrophobins A-C in the concentration of 0. 1 % (w/v). The used reference solution contained 10 % (w/v) of terbinafine in 60 % (v/v) ethanol/water without enhancer. Permeability studies have been performed on cadaver nails using Franz diffusion cells modified to mount nail plates and filled with 60 % (v/v) ethanol/water in the acceptor chamber. Terbinafine was quantitatively determined by HPLC. The amount of terbinafine remaining in the nail was extracted by 96 % ethanol from pulverized nail material after <b>permeation</b> <b>experiment</b> and presented as percentage of the dry nail weight before the milling test. Permeability coefficient (PC) of terbinafine from reference solution was determined to be 1. 52 E- 10 cm/s. Addition of hydrophobins improved PC in the range of 3 E- 10 to 2 E- 9 cm/s. Remaining terbinafine reservoir in the nail from reference solution was 0. 83 % (n= 2). An increase of remaining terbinafine reservoir in the nail was observed in two out of three tested formulations containing hydrophobins compared to the reference. In all cases, known minimum inhibitory concentration of terbinafine for dermatophytes (0. 003 mug/ml) has been exceeded in the acceptor chamber of the diffusion cells. All tested proteins (hydrophobins) facilitated terbinafine permeation after 10 days of <b>permeation</b> <b>experiment,</b> however one of them achieved an outstanding enhancement factor of 13. 05 compared to the reference.

This review focuses on presenting the asymptotic solution of the mass balance diffusion equations and includes applications of time lag analysis, in order to give a critical and broad perspective of this method as a tool for characterisation. It includes much of the previously published literature in order to show that for most cases the asymptotic solution of the transport equations is simple, and for more complex cases that an analytical solution is possible hence avoiding cumbersome numerical techniques...|$|E

The results showed that BO {{has the potential to}} be used as a transdermal penetration enhancer to help osthole (OST) penetrate into the bilayer. With the increasing temperature, the stratum corneum (SC) becomes more flexible, proving to be synergistic with the permeation enhancement of BO, and the lag time (TLag) of BO and OST are shortened. However, when the temperature increased too much, with the effect of BO, the structure of SC was destroyed; for example, a water pore was formed and the micelle reversed. Though there were a number of drugs coming into the SC, the normal bilayer structure was absent. In addition, through comparing the simulation, in vitro experiment, and TEM study, we concluded that the computer simulation provided some visually detailed information, and the method plays an important role in related studies of permeation...|$|E
