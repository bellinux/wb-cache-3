40|$|The central aim of {{this thesis}} is to support the efforts to {{counteract}} certain environmental problems caused by emissions of volatile organic compounds. The purpose of this work was (1) to develop a method to establish the amount of emitted substances from dryers, (2) {{to determine the effect}} of drying medium temperature and end moisture content of the processed material on emissions of monoterpenes and other hydrocarbons, (3) to examine the emissions of monoterpenes during production of pellets, and (4) to examine the natural emissions from forests with an eye to implications for modelling. The measurement method (1) resolves the difficulties caused by diffuse emissions, and also solves the problems associated with high moisture content of the drying medium. The basic idea is to use water vapour to determine the exhaust flow, while a dry ice trap is used both to preconcentrate emitted volatile organic compounds and to determine the moisture content of the drying medium. The method as used in this paper has an uncertainty of 13 % using a 95 % confidence interval. Emissions from a spouted bed (2) in continuous operation drying Norway spruce sawdust at temperatures of 140 °C, 170 °C or 200 °C was analysed with FID and GC-MS. When the sawdust end moisture content was reduced below 10 %wb, emissions of terpenes and volatile organic compounds per oven dry weight increased rapidly. Increased temperature of the drying medium increased the amounts of emitted monoterpenes when sawdust moisture content was below the fibre saturation point. Examination of sawdust and wood pellets from different <b>pellets</b> <b>producers</b> (3) revealed that most of the terpene emissions happened during the drying step, with rotary dryers causing higher emissions than steam dryers. Almost all of the volatile terpenes remaining in wood after drying were released during pelleting. When sawdust with higher moisture content was used in the pellets press, the terpene emissions were increased. Terpenes emitted naturally from vegetation can have an adverse environmental impact. Factors affecting terpene emissions from tree species in Sweden were reviewed (4). Models for prediction of terpene fluxes should include not only temperature but also light intensity, seasonal variation, and a base level of herbivory and insect predation. Prediction of high concentrations of ambient terpenes demand sufficient resolution to capture emission peaks e. g. those caused by bud break...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to enable}} Canadian wood <b>pellet</b> <b>producers</b> with the {{opportunity}} to offer competitive pricing through optimization of their value chains and supply chains, by employing an operational-level decision support tool (DST). Improving the competitiveness of Canada?s individual wood pellet manufacturers will ultimately improve Canada?s position amidst the rapidly developing global wood pellet market. Primary information is used from a case study of Industries Lacwood (ILW), in Hearst, ON; a firm that produces wood pellets using residue generated from processing of its primary wood items. The specific objectives of this study are to: 1) Determine how to optimize the operations of a wood <b>pellet</b> <b>producer,</b> through a comparison of three different gross margin (GM) optimization models, given uncertain demand conditions. These three models will illustrate why it is important to utilize inventory and a variable production rate, in order to most effectively optimize the GM of a <b>pellet</b> <b>producer,</b> given uncertain consumer demand. 2) Produce 100 demand datasets (to satisfy the Central Limit Theorem) for pellet 1 and pellet 2 and run these datasets through each of the three models created for objective 1. Compare the GM results of the three models and demonstrate why the operational environment specified in model 2 should be used for GM optimization of wood <b>pellet</b> <b>producers,</b> and will be used for further analysis. 3) Generate stochastic demand schedules for pellets by averaging the 100 demand datasets produced for objective 2. Use these stochastic demand schedules as the base case demand input values for model 2, along with other standard input values (obtained from ILW). Benchmark output values of production, inventory and unfulfilled demand generated from these standard inputs are compared with output values of production, inventory and unfulfilled demand generated from the variable inputs of 11 different scenarios. These comparisons will illustrate how model 2 is a comprehensive DST that the operational-level managers of wood <b>pellet</b> <b>producers</b> may use to achieve optimal GMs for the producer, under uncertain demand conditions and with other variable input factors.

The aim of this thesis is to investigate to what degree increased use of new raw materials for pellet production will affect the general pellet prices in Sweden and to survey what plans Swedish <b>pellet</b> <b>producers</b> have concerning new raw materials. To investigate the raw material situation of the Swedish <b>pellet</b> <b>producers</b> an industry survey was performed. Literature studies were also made on previous research in the subject field. Calculations of the production costs for pellets were done for the raw materials sawdust, wet sawmill chips and energy wood respectively.                  New raw materials are already used by the large-scale <b>pellet</b> <b>producers</b> in Sweden. It is mainly the large-scale producers that have started to use new raw materials such as energy wood, wet sawmill chips and dry chips. Around 65 % of the respondents of the survey were planning for new raw materials. Most commonly planned for was energy wood. Most of the <b>pellet</b> <b>producers</b> in the survey were planning for raw materials that give high quality pellets. The minimum price for pellets is in the long run set by the production costs. The raw material costs are {{the most important part of}} the production costs and according to results from the survey they also affect the pellet prices most. For pellets made of sawdust the raw material costs were typically 2 / 3 of the total production costs in 2009. In calculations of production costs, wet sawmill chips resulted in a decreased cost by 4 % compared to sawdust, mainly because of less expensive raw material. Energy wood also resulted in decreased production costs by 4 % compared to sawdust, assuming that the thermal energy needed for drying could be entirely produced with the bark from the debarking process. Both energy wood and wet sawmill chips could hence decrease the production costs and thereby the price for pellets. Even though there is a much greater maximum pellet production potential for wet sawmill chips than for sawdust the amounts of available raw material will, among other factors, depend on the development in the pulp industry...|$|R

40|$|Wood pellet {{production}} in the southern United States {{has more than doubled}} in the past three years, surpassing western Canada as the region in North America with the greatest production. Most of this increase is caused by a few large plants being built specifically for export to Europe where the pellets are burned for electricity. The economics for producers in the region are helped by the decline in manufacture of traditional wood products including structural panels, lumber, and pulp and paper. Demand for wood pellets is set to continue its rapid rise though some of the traditional wood products are also set to rebound. Of concern for <b>pellet</b> <b>producers</b> is both U. S. made pellets? future position in the world energy market as well as their place in the fiber market of the southern United States. In addition, when pellets are stored in large volumes, there is a heating effect. This effect is exacerbated by a hot and humid subtropical climate as well as the feedstock of choice of large producers (Southern Yellow Pine). This heating can cause great expense to producers who are shipping overseas as bulk carriers and European buyers usually have a threshold temperature for biological materials shipped overseas. In addition, this heating often exacerbates convection currents and water deposition inside storage piles before loading. This water can quickly degrade pellets. The first chapter of this thesis looks at the pellet markets worldwide as well as the state of the wood fiber markets in the southern U. S. which made it possible for wood pellet production to get a foothold in the region. It is concluded that use of wood pellets worldwide will grow, with most growth localized in northern Europe and North America. Production in the Southeast will continue to expand, taking much of the fiber that would have been taken by the now shrinking pulp and paper industries though also utilizing residues from sawmilling and possibly harvest residues. The second chapter is a factorial analysis in which production factors such as drying temperature and aging are varied between different production runs at the plant of a large wood <b>pellet</b> <b>producer.</b> Quality attributes such as bulk density, durability, and moisture content of pellets going into storage were also monitored. It was then assessed whether these factors had any effect on the temperatures attained in storage. It was found that the most significant factor in the self heating of pellets was the starting temperature of pellets. Therefore, wood <b>pellet</b> <b>producers</b> may do well by investing in consistent and effective methods of cooling pellets after the production runs. Drying temperature also seemed to have a negative correlation to temperature increase though more research is needed as to whether this effect remains when controlling for start temperature...|$|R

Fecal pellets > 100 um in trap samples were classified according to morphology as tabular, ellipsoidal, or cylindrical.

Most pellets arrived at the traps in short-lived, high-flux events {{from the end of}} January through early March. Numerically, tabular pellets dominated pellet flux to 250 meters, and ellipsoidal pellets dominated pellet flux to the sea floor. This change suggests the presence of an active mid-depth zooplankton community that intercepts and repackages settling material. The different physical properties and settling velocities of the pellet types indicate that changes in <b>pellet</b> <b>producer</b> populations might significantly affect vertical flux and could modify regional biogeochemical cycles...|$|R

In this paper, the pellet markets, raw materials and supply structures are analyzed for Sweden and Finland, based on a database of the current location and production capacity of the <b>pellet</b> <b>producers,</b> complemented with existing reports and literature. In Sweden, a total of 94 pellet plants/producers were identified, producing 1. 4 Â million tonnes of pellets, while the domestic consumption was 1. 7 Â million tonnes, and about 400, 000 Â t of pellets were imported to fulfil the demand in 2007. In Finland, 24 pellet plants/producers were identified and the production was around 330, 000 Â t while the domestic consumption was 117, 000 Â t in 2007. In Finland, pellet market has been long time export oriented, whereas domestic consumption has been growing mainly in the small scale consumer sector, estimated 15, 000 households had pellet heating systems in 2008.

The calculation of the production costs before starting a pellet plant is essential for an economic operation.

The production costs for wood pellets are mainly influenced by the raw material costs and, in the case of using wet raw materials, by the drying costs. Depending on the framework conditions these two parameters can contribute up to one-third of the total pellet production costs. Other important parameters influencing the pellet production costs are the plant utilisation (number of shifts per week) as well as the availability of the plant. For an economic production of wood pellets at least three shifts per day at 5 days per week are necessary. An optimum would be an operation at 7 days per week. A low plant availability also leads to greatly increased pellet production costs. A plant availability of 85 – 90...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{renewable}} forms of energy, such as bioenergy produced from wood pellets, {{can serve to}} offset fossil fuel use and, hence, reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union is the world's largest user of wood pellets and British Columbia {{has been one of}} its largest external suppliers. British Columbia is currently grappling with the largest mountain pine beetle outbreak in its history.

Here we evaluate estimates of the amount of biomass available for bioenergy production in British Columbia and quantify the effects of the mountain pine beetle infestation on wood pellet feedstock supply chains. Our results, though subject to significant uncertainties, suggest that mountain pine beetle-killed wood is unlikely to be a substantial constituent of wood pellet feedstocks unless substantial subsidies are provided to offset higher harvesting costs. Even if such subsidies are implemented, it is likely that harvest residues will constitute an increasing proportion of wood pellet feedstocks as the volume of beetle-killed wood becomes depleted. Therefore, it is imperative that wood <b>pellet</b> <b>producers</b> improve the cost efficiency of harvest residue collection if they are to remain competitive in the European marketplace...|$|R

While much work has been done in the past to utilize fly ash rather than disposing of it, we nevertheless do not find widespread examples of successful industrial utilization. This is because past work has tended to find uses only for high-quality, easily-utilized fly ashes, which account for less than 25 % of the fly ash that {{is produced}}. The main factor which makes fly ashes unusable is a high unburned carbon content. In this project, physical separation technologies are being used to remove this carbon, and to convert these unusable fly ashes into usable products. The main application being studied for the processed fly ash is as a binder for inorganic materials, such as iron-ore pellets. The project began in the current quarter.

The results revealed strong regional and seasonal variations of pellet carbon input related to differences in structure and dynamics of the zooplankton communities in the regions studied. In the deep regions of the White Sea, maximum daily pellet carbon flux from the 0 - 50 m layer was observed in the spring. It reached 98 mg Corg m- 2 day- 1 and coincided with a strong predominance of the large arctic herbivorous copepod Calanus glacialis in the surface layers. In summer and fall, it decreased by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude due to migration of this copepod to its overwintering depths. In contrast, in the shallow coastal regions, the pellet production was low in spring, gradually increased during summer and reached its maximum of 138 mg Corg m- 2 day- 1 by late summer to beginning of autumn. Such a seasonal pattern was {{in accordance with the}} seasonal variation of abundance of major <b>pellet</b> <b>producers,</b> the small boreal copepods Acartia bifilosa, Centropages hamatus, and Temora longicornis. In the estuarine zone of the Kara Sea, the pellet flux was mostly formed by pellets of brackish-water omnivorous copepods. It varied from 35 mg Corg m- 2 day- 1 in 1997 to 96 mg Corg m- 2 day- 1 in 1999. In the central Kara Sea with its typical marine community, the daily flux reached 125 mg Corg m- 2 day- 1 in summer.

40|$|In 2014, Portugal was {{the seventh}} largest <b>pellets</b> <b>producer</b> in the World. Since the {{shortage}} of raw material {{is one of the}} major obstacles that the Portuguese pellets market faces, the need for a good assessment of biomass availability for energy purposes at both country and regional levels is reinforced. This work uses a Geographical Information System environment and remote sensing data to assess the availability and sustainability of forest biomass residues in a management unit with around 940 ha of maritime pine forest. The period considered goes from 2004 to 2015. The study area is located in Southwestern Portugal, close to a pellets factory; therefore the potential contribution of the residual biomass generated in the management unit to the production of pellets is evaluated. An allometric function is used for the estimation of maritime pine above ground biomass. With this estimate, and considering several forest operations, the residual biomass available was assessed, according to stand composition and structure. This study shows that, when maritime pine forests are managed to produce wood, the amount of residues available for energy production is small (an average of 0. 37 t/ha/year were generated in the study area between 2004 and 2015). As a contribution to the sustainability of the Portuguese pellets industries, new management models for maritime pine forests may be developed. The effect of the pinewood nematode on the availability of residual biomass can be clearly seen in this study. In the management unit considered, cuts were made to prevent dissemination of the disease. This contributes to a higher availability of forest residues in a specific period of time, but, in the medium term, they lead to a decrease in the amount of residues that can be used for energy purposes.

40|$|With {{respect to}} the use of {{densified}} biomass fuels in fully automatic heating systems for the residential sector a high quality of these fuels is required. Several European countries already have implemented standards for such fuels. In other countries such standards are in preparation or planned. Furthermore, in some countries also standards from associations are existing (e. g. from the Austrian Pellets Association). In addition to these national standards, European standards for solid biomass fuels are under development. For producers of densified biomass fuels, especially for <b>pellet</b> <b>producers,</b> it is therefore very important to produce high-quality fuels keeping the limiting values of the standards addressed. However, in this context it has to be considered that as a high fuel quality as is necessary for the combustion of densified biomass fuels in automatic small-scale furnaces is not necessary if these fuels are used in larger industrial furnaces as they are equipped with more sophisticated flue gas cleaning, combustion and process control systems. Two pellet qualities, one for industrial and one for small-scale consumers seem to be more meaningful. Within the framework of the EU-ALTENER-project 2 ̆ 2 An Integrated European Market for Densified Biomass Fuels (INDEBIF) 2 ̆ 2 a questionnaire survey of European producers of densified biomass fuels was performed. In this connection the possibility was offered to the producers to participate in an analysis programme with their fuels. An overview was obtained of the qualities of densified biomass fuels offered in the European market, covering pellets and briquettes from Austria, Italy, Sweden, Spain, Norway and the Czech Republic. The parameters analysed were the dimensions of the fuels, the bulk and the particle density, the water and the ash content, the gross and the net calorific value, the abrasion, the content of starch (as an indication for the use of biological binding agents), the concentrations of C, H, N, S, Cl, K {{as well as of the}} heavy metals Cd, Pb, Zn, Cr, Cu, As and Hg. These parameters have been chosen following the Austrian, German, Swiss and Swedish standards for densified biomass fuels. The results showed that a majority of the participating producers produce fuels of high quality. However, wood <b>pellets</b> of some <b>producers</b> show a high abrasion, one of the most important quality parameters for pellets. An increased amount of fines often causes failures in the feeding systems used in the residential heating sector. In order to decrease abrasion, the addition of small amounts of biological binding agents (e. g. maize or rye) is possible. This kind of additive is most common in Austria. Moreover, some producers obviously use not only chemically untreated raw materials or additives, which increase the content of pollutants. Such fuels cause problems regarding emissions, deposit formation and corrosion. Emission problems are expected due to increased contents of N, Cl, S as well as heavy metals. Increased concentrations of heavy metals additionally contaminate the ash, increased Cl concentrations raise the risk of corrosion. Moreover, an increased content of K has a negative effect on the ash melting behaviour and causes higher aerosol formation, which enhances deposit formation and particulate emissions...|$|R

Objective of the research was to produce scientifically and professionally founded conclusions and the related adequate recommendations to the decision makers in order to improve the situation on wood pellets market in Serbia and eliminate the existing problems which significantly burden and slow down this development. Special objective of the research was to observe the contributions of wood pellets to the mitigation of climate changes using Serbia as the example. Results of the conducted research show that the expansion of the consumption (demand) increase in the European Union countries in the last fifteen years and the related increase of export from Serbia are the most significant factors which have influenced the development of wood pellets production in Serbia. Parameters of econometric model of the impact of export on the increase of production show that production increase of 1. 17 % can be expected with the increase of export of 1 %. Thus, the number of wood <b>pellet</b> <b>producers</b> has rapidly increased in the last ten years, from 2 producers in 2006 to 52 active producers in 2016. Increase of the number of producers was also accompanied by the increase of the installed capacities. At the end of 2015, total installed capacities for wood pellet production in Serbia reached 550 thousand tons, and the realized production was 229 thousand tons, or 41. 6 % of the installed capacity. Consumption of wood pellets in Serbia {{in the last four years}} achieved significant increase and reached the level of 89 thousand tons in 2015. However, concerning the segment of wood pellets consumption in Serbia, the situation is still unsatisfactory despite the fact that the consumption has been increasing year after year. Average price of 1 kWh of energy from wood pellets exported from Serbia was in the range 20 - 44 ¢$, which is 2. 1 to 3. 2 times less than the price of 1 kWh of energy from the natural gas which was imported in Serbia in the observed period.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this project is to assess the {{environmental}} impacts associated with the wood pellet production. The study has extended to the entire life cycle of wood pellet, which includes the up- and down-stream processes. Therefore it leaves the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) the best method to carry out such study. LCA is a popular tool for evaluating environmental impacts of products or services. In this study, the mainstream LCA methodology is adopted, which includes four steps starting from goal and scope definition, life cycle inventory analysis, to life cycle impact assessment, and interpretation. The {{results of the study}} will be used for the wood <b>pellet</b> <b>producer</b> to communicate with its customers and also facilitate a better environmental management. The entire life cycle of wood pellet can be divided into eight main processes. According to the results of inventory analysis, the Silviculture is the most fossil fueldependant process, while the Pellet Production is, however, the most energy-intense process. Regarding the emissions, the final Combustion process contributes most to the air emissions, but the Pellet Production has a remarkably high emission of hydrocarbons, which can be explained as incomplete combustion of a mass of biofuel. The resources use, on the other hand, is close related to the consumption of electricity, since the electricity production is included in the system. The process with bigger demand of electricity results in bigger amount of resources use. When it comes to the characterisation level, the inventory data have been aggregated and translated into real environmental impacts. There are at least six different environmental impacts are possible to be initiated from the wood pellets production. It is noted that the Silviculture and the final Combustion are the least environmental preferable processes, due to the relatively big environmental impacts potential in relation to these two processes. There are three valuation methods involved in the report to weigh the importance of the environmental impacts against from one to another. The results of the three valuation methods are somehow different, which is, however, only because the methods tend to weight the importance of the environmental impacts from different perspective, and there is no such best weighting method exits.

These problems can be partially solved by ensuring a continuous and reliable flow of information regarding the quality parameters of wood <b>pellets</b> from the <b>producers</b> to the final users. The aim of this work is to define a metric index for quality parameters that can detect the certifiability of analyzed samples compared with those on the market. The model is built on measured quality parameters of certified and non-certified wood pellet samples taken from products on the market applying a multivariate class modelling methodology (soft independent modelling of class analogy, SIMCA). Results showed that the model can predict the general quality of some test samples and that its precision, already fairly high, can be constantly improved by adding new model samples. The output of the model is also the relative influence (modelling power) of each variable in the prediction of certifiability. The SIMCA model could be easily integrated and implemented on the most common digital platforms where users (private, laboratories, agencies, etc.) could test their samples and verify if the index of their pellet falls within the area defined by the model for certified sample...|$|R

För att möta utmaningarna som klimatavtalet kräver behöver samhället en omställning från ett beroende av fossil energi. Förbränning av biobränslen har god {{potential}} att konkurrera ut fossila bränslen. Pellets av stamved har ett högt energivärde och har goda framtidsutsikter till att bli en stark konkurrent till fossilbaserad energi, främst för små- och mellanskalig värme- och kraftproduktion. För att göra pellets mer attraktivt på marknaden gäller det att den levereras med hög kvalitet, med fokus på energivärde, hållbarhet och avsaknaden av driftproblem vid förbränning. Härjeåns Energi i Sveg vill veta mer om driftproblemet slaggbildning och hur det kan undvikas genom åtgärder i hela kedjan från råvaruhantering till pelletsproduktion och förbränning. Det övergripande syftet med projektet var att kartlägga askrelaterade problem vid förbränning av träpellets i rosterpannor med fokus på sintring och slaggning samt att ge rekommendationer på åtgärder hur producenten och privatpersoner kan undvika sådana problem. Arbetet med detta examensarbete delades upp i två delar, dels en genomgång av forskningen på området, och dels en utredning av hanteringen hos Härjeåns Energi samt dess underleverantörer.

To face the challenges of a required conversion to renewable energy, the dependence of fossil fuels need to be drastically reduced. Combustion of biomass has a god potential to replace fossil fuels in many applications. Pellets made from stemwood has a high energy value and is a good candidate to replace fossil fuels in small and medium scale heat and power production. To make pellets more attractive on the market, the delivered pellets need to have high quality and enable low maintenance and operational problems during combustion. Härjeåns Energi in Sveg {{would like to know}} more about the ash related issues like slagging and sintering, and how it can be avoided be measures related to handling, pellet production and end use (combustion). The overall objectives of the present work was to identify ash related problems during combustion of wood pellets in heating boilers, focusing on sintering and slagging, and to provide recommendations on measures how to avoid such problems for producers and individuals. This work with the report was divided into two parts. The first part included a research review on the subject. The second part included an investigation of the handling by Härjeåns Energi and their subcontractors. The research review was carried out by reading the research, mainly in scientific peer- review papers from the last 25 years. The investigation of the handling was carried out by evaluating analysis data of pellets, raw material and slagg samples. The results showed that the most important factor that influence slag formation is the concentrations of certain ash forming elements in fuel, such as silicon, potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium aluminum and iron. Also ash content, combustion technology and combustion temperature are of importance. Substances in the fuels that are associated with slagging tendencies originate mainly from different kinds of contaminations, e. g. sand, soil and clay. This is most likely the case for Härjeåns Energi. The results also showed that the ash fusion temperatures of the raw material ash where constantly high during the weeks of the summer 2016. The remaining weeks of the year showed more varying ash melting temperatures. The produced pellets from Härjeåns Energi 2016 had a high ash molting temperature during the year of 2016, except in October. The exact reason behind the relative low ash melting temperatures is difficult to point out specifically in this work, and need more careful investigations. Overall, it is the <b>pellets</b> <b>producer,</b> the subcontractors and the manufacturer of the heating devices that have the possibilities to develop product and measures which avoid or reduces slagging related problems. The end users (customers) have very small opportunities to influence the outcome of the combustion of pellets. ...|$|R

A total of 192 pigs (initially 13. 2 ± 1. 9 lb and 21 ± 3 d of age) were used, with 6 pigs per pen and 6 pens per treatment. Pigs were randomly allotted in a 2 × 2 factorial to pens, blocked by weight, and randomly allotted to one of four dietary treatments. The main effects were diet form, meal or pellet, and either irradiated SDAP or nonirradiated SDAP. The experimental treatments consisted of a single diet that was fed in either meal or pelleted form, with or without irradiation of SDAP for Phase 1 (d 0 to 11), and a common diet for Phase 2 (d 11 to 25). Pig fed pelleted diets from d 0 to 3 had a greater ADG, ADFI, and improved F/G (P< 0. 03) than did pigs fed meal diets. Irradiation of SDAP had no effect on performance from d 0 to 3; for d 3 to 11, however, there was a diet form × SDAP irradiation interaction (P < 0. 01), and for d 0 to 11 there was interaction for ADG and F/G (P< 0. 07). Pigs fed irradiated SDAP in meal form had similar growth performance to those fed <b>pelleted</b> treatments. For <b>producers</b> that manufacture their own Phase 1 diet in meal form, use of irradiated SDAP can result in performance equal to that of nursery pigs fed a pelleted diet...|$|R
40|$|A {{review was}} made of the current and past use of {{long-term}} supply contracts in the forestry, coal, and natural gas industries to assess the applicability of long-term supply contracts in bioenergy and why they are not prevalent. To assess past use, an extensive literature review was undertaken. In determining the current use of long-term supply contracts, professionals throughout woody biomass supply chain were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Participants represented forest landowners (non-industrial and industrial), <b>pellet</b> and biofuel <b>producers,</b> forestry management consultants, procurement firms, and energy producers (Biomass facilities, investor-owned utilities, and electric cooperatives). Participants were asked about their experiences with long-term supply contracts, willingness to enter into future long-term supply contracts, and factors that impact the decision-making process for decided whether to sell on the spot market or enter a long-term contract. Current use of long-term supply contracts was mixed, with only a few participants having willingly entered into a long-term supply contract. Several participants, who currently did not utilize long-term supply contracts, believed they had a system that worked and saw no need to change what “wasn’t broken. ” At the same time, many of these participants were open to considering long-term supply contracts in the future. Participants indicated several factors that were important to them when considering long-term supply contracts. Loss of control was particularly important for nonindustrial private timberland owners. Control was also important to other stakeholders in the bioenergy supply chain. These stakeholders believed long-term contracts could help them control the market by minimizing risk. Other important factors mentioned were the scale of operations to back a contract, pricing, use of long-term offtake agreements, building mills in areas with less competition, and the higher costs of bioenergy. Results from this study suggest the current lack of long-term supply contracts is attributable to a combination of relatively easy availability of wood, consumers not willing to pay a premium for a less efficient energy source as compared to coal, and stakeholders in the bioenergy supply chain being satisfied with their current system to procure/sell fiber. So is the current status quo likely to change? The answer is complicated. Due to the inefficiencies of woody biomass for energy and the efficiencies of using fossil fuels, bioenergy is not likely to gain significant market share without consumers being willing to pay more for energy. In places where it has expanded in use, contracts have usually been backed by subsidies. In the end, possibly the most important factor is how stakeholders view long-term contracts as a strategy. Buyers in this study mentioned them being financial undesirable due to their higher costs associated with price premiums. Sellers, on the other hand, said they felt long-term contracts would limit their ability to receive maximum value for their timber. Is it possible for them to be both? Well if the contract includes a rolling average pricing mechanism, it’s possible that at times it will be the highest priced/cost timber, and at other times the lowest priced/cost timber. It will however, never reach the market peaks or troughs that parties might experience in the spot market. Thus, if layered appropriately, it’s possible to keep your revenue/expenses relatively flat compared to participating in the spot market. This strategy is utilized by many Utilities and allows them to focus on eliminating inefficiencies elsewhere in their business while guaranteeing a steady supply/price. Thus, if parties looked at long-term contracts as a way to minimize market risk, via lowering market swings, we could see an increased future use of long-term contracts in the bioenergy and forestry industries...|$|R

Chicken manure is one of our by-products which is disregarded and sell cheaply (five baht per six kilograms) to middlemen who sell it to fertilizer factories. The factory sells their fertilizers three to seven baht per kilogram. To increase our profitability and generate the effective fertilizer to farmers for developing Thailand’s agriculture, we have planned to establish Neugjamnong Fertilizer under Neungjamnong Company to produce and sell fertilizers that are derived from our by-products. The amount of additional funding, that we need to invest in our capital assets, run business and generate net profits of 4. 1 million baht in the second year, is three million baht. This business plan is created to plan our business strategic, operating, marketing and a financial scheme based on the realistic market. The Company Neungjamnong Fertilizer is a <b>pelleted</b> bio-organic fertilizer <b>producer</b> for the crop grown in Thailand. The company is located in Chonburi, Eastern Thailand which is one of most significant industrial and agricultural province in Thailand. It has rubber, sugarcane, pineapple, cassava plantation and rice farming. The project leader is Natthaphat Neungjamnong who is good at business management and micro-organism understanding that is an advantage for business. The propose of our company is to encourage the growth of agricultural fundamentals of Thailand, organic farming and consumer health as well as help farmers to make more profitability. The Product Our non-chemical fertilizer is developed specifically from natural ingredients and organic compost with effective micro-organism for maximising the productivity of plantation, increase crop yield and boost the growth of the plant. The main ingredient of our fertilizer is poultry faeces that is from our standard chicken farms. Our product is processed from the mix between chicken manure, effective micro-organisms (EM) and dolomite lime. Although our bio-organic fertilizer's price is slightly higher when compared with normal organic fertilizer, bio-organic fertilizer is more effective than organic fertilizer due to micro-organism. Our product is created in pellets that are no unpleasant odour, easily to store and use with the fertilizer spreader. This fertilizer’s formula is appropriated for crops such as rubber, cassava and sugarcane. We have planned to create three more products which are specific to another type of plants and lunch each product every six months. Corporate Strategy To attract target customers who own over 50 rai (19 acres) of the plantation in Thailand, we plan to introduce our reasonable price fertilizers to farmers, provide free trials to customers who are interested in our products for 0. 4 acres during a cycle of harvest and also give one-kg free fertilizers to attendants at agricultural events. Moreover, we have planned to promote our fertilizers through a website, Social Media, magazines and agricultural events to increase brand recognition and brand awareness.
