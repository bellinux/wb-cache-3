60|$|Now {{in the big}} {{silence of}} the snow is born, perhaps, not {{a little of that}} New England {{conscience}} which her children write about. There is much time to think, and thinking is a highly dangerous business. Conscience, fear, undigested reading, and, it may be, not too well cooked food, have full swing. A man, and more particularly a woman, can easily hear strange voices--the Word of the Lord rolling between the dead hills; may see visions and dream dreams; get revelations and an outpouring of the spirit, and end (such things have been) lamentably enough in those big houses by the Connecticut River which have been tenderly christened The Retreat. Hate breeds as well as religion--the deep, instriking hate between neighbours, that is born of a hundred little things added up, brooded over, and hatched by the stove when two or three talk together in the long evenings. It would be very interesting to get the statistics of revivals and murders, and find how many of them have been committed in the spring. But for undistracted people winter is one long delight of the eye. In other lands one knows the snow as a nuisance that comes and goes, and is sorely man-handled and messed at the last. Here it lies longer on the ground than any crop--from November to April sometimes--and for three months life goes to the tune of sleigh-bells, which are not, as a Southern visitor once hinted, ostentation, but safeguards. The man who drives without them is not loved. The snow is a faithful barometer, foretelling good sleighing or stark confinement to barracks. It is all the manure the stony pastures receive; it cloaks the ground and prevents the frost bursting pipes; it is the best--I had almost written the only--road-maker in the States. On the other side it can rise up in the night and bid the people sit still as the Egyptians. It can stop mails; wipe out all time-tables; extinguish the lamps of twenty towns, and kill man within sight of his own door-step or hearing of his cattle unfed. No one who has been through even so modified a blizzard as New England can produce talks lightly of the snow. Imagine eight-and-forty hours of roaring wind, the thermometer well down towards zero, scooping and gouging across a hundred miles of newly fallen snow. The air is full of stinging shot, and at ten yards the trees are invisible. The foot slides on a reef, polished and black as obsidian, where the wind has skinned an exposed corner of road down to the dirt ice of early winter. The next step ends hip-deep and over, for here an unseen wall is banking back the rush of the singing drifts. A scarped slope rises sheer across the road. The wind shifts a point or two, and all sinks down, like sand in the hour-glass, leaving a <b>pot-hole</b> of whirling whiteness. There is a lull, {{and you can see the}} surface of the fields settling furiously in one direction--a tide that spurts from between the tree-boles. The hollows of the pasture fill while you watch; empty, fill, and discharge anew. The rock-ledges show the bare flank of a storm-chased liner for a moment, and whitening, duck under. Irresponsible snow-devils dance by the lee of a barn where three gusts meet, or stagger out into the open till they are cut down by the main wind. At the worst of the storm there is neither Heaven nor Earth, but only a swizzle into which a man may be brewed. Distances grow to nightmare scale, and that which in the summer was no more than a minute's bare-headed run, is half an hour's gasping struggle, each foot won between the lulls. Then do the heavy-timbered barns talk like ships in a cross-sea, beam working against beam. The winter's hay is ribbed over with long lines of snow dust blown between the boards, and far below in the byre the oxen clash their horns and moan uneasily.|$|E

40|$|Long {{held to be}} {{reasonably}} well understood, the process of ecological succession has recently come under attack.

In particular, several communities are presently recognized as having 2 ̆ 2 cyclic succession 2 ̆ 2 (Ricklefs 1973), in which the process is continually repeating. Such communities include heaths (Watt 1947), prairie <b>pot-hole</b> marshes (Vander Valk and Davis 1978), spruce-fir forests (Sprugel 1976, Sprugel and Bormann 1981), and intertidal communities (Levin and Paine 1974).

40|$|With {{the object}} of obtaining a current insight into the {{relationship}} of crows to waterfowl on their breeding grounds, a study was inaugurated {{in the spring of}} 1934 and continued through the nesting season of that and the following year. As originally planned, it called for field studies both in Canada and in the northern United States, but drought conditions had so drastically reduced the breeding population of ducks within our borders by the spring of 1934 that, after a futile effort to locate suitable areas in this country, plans were changed and the studies were restricted to Canadian areas in Saskatchewan and Alberta, where ducks and crows could be found in reasonable abundance and in close association. The scenes of the studies cover three rather circumscribed areas- two in Saskatchewan and one in Alberta-and, although the writer believes that the facts revealed and the conclusions reached are reasonably accurate for these areas, no claim is made that the findings represent a cross-section of crow-waterfowl relationships throughout Canada. As a matter of fact the results obtained in the two areas in Saskatchewan clearly show that there may be great variation in the degree of pressure exerted by the crow at points only 50 miles apart. Much less can the results be construed as representative of what takes place in the Northern States of this country, where as yet {{there is a lack of}} adequate information regarding 2 ̆ 2 average 2 ̆ 2 conditions on duck-nesting grounds.

40|$|In 1991, {{reacting}} to public concern about its disappearing wetlands, the State of Minnesota initiated the Wetland Conservation Act (WCA), {{one of the}} most sweeping wetland protection laws in the country. The purpose of the WCA is to maintain and protect Minnesota’s wetlands and the benefits they provide. With its goal of no-net-loss of wetlands, the Wetland Conservation Act (WCA) requires anyone proposing to drain or fill a wetland first to try to avoid disturbing the wetland; second, to try to minimize any impact on the wetland; and, finally, to replace any lost wetland acres, functions, and values. The WCA allows and encourages the replacement of impacted wetlands from public transportation projects through the establishment of wetland banks. In 1996, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) and the Minnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources began planning the development of a joint agency wetland bank project. The project area is approximately 1, 800 acres in size and is the largest wetland bank site in the state. When the third and final phase of the project is completed in 2003, approximately 1, 500 acres of wetland credits will be established. The project restores about 150 prairie <b>pot-hole</b> basins and their surrounding uplands using diverse local ecotype seed mixes. Located in northwestern Minnesota, the wetland complex is within the North American migratory bird flyway, and is also in the naturally occurring range of the North American Prairie chicken. The project was funded by Mn/DOT and BWSR at a cost of a little over $ 2. 0 million. The net cost per acre of wetland credit will be in the neighborhood of $ 1, 500.

Nesse contexto esta pesquisa objetiva a descriÃÃo das formas topogrÃficas de fundos de vale no Planalto de Cascavel. O mÃtodo para o reconhecimento dessas formas topogrÃficas consiste no mapeamento de seÃÃes transversais em trechos distintos do canal localizados no alto, mÃdio e baixo curso. O mapeamento Ã realizado com um conjunto de nÃvel Ãtico e mira. Foram mapeados quatro canais fluviais, sendo dois canais em Ãreas com cotas altimÃtricas inferiores a 400 metros e, outros dois canais com cotas superiores a 700 metros. Os canais apresentam planÃcies de inundaÃÃo com extensÃes variadas. Foram encontradas formas topogrÃficas como diques, barras em pontal, bacias de inundaÃÃo, soleiras e depressÃes.

O meandramento de canais Ã uma caracterÃstica do Planalto de Cascavel. A formaÃÃo de barras em pontal estÃ associada diretamente a erosÃo marginal, enquanto que os diques sÃo resultantes da decantaÃÃo de sedimentos.

The modeling occurs through the processes of erosion and deposition of sediments, which depend on variables such as lithological composition, slope, and flooding. The processes that originate topographic forms are widely described {{in the literature of}} alluvial-bed rivers, however {{little is known about the}} occurrence of these forms in mixed bed channels (alluvial-rock) and bedrock channel. In this context, this research aims to describe the topographic forms of the valleys on the Cascavel Plateau. The method for the recognition of these forms is the topographic mapping of cross sections in different parts of the channel located at the top, middle and lower course. The mapping is performed with a set level and optical sights. Were mapped four fluvial channels, two channels in areas with altimetric elevations below 400 meters, and two other channels with elevations above 700 meters. The channels have floodplains with varying lengths. Topographic forms were found as dikes, point bars, flood inundation basins, pools and riffles. The data collected show strong channel incision in the sections corresponding to the upper parts of the channels, and that in the course stretches of low flood plains are well developed. Channel meandering is a characteristic feature of the Cascavel Plateau. The formation of point bars is directly associated with the channel marginal erosion, whereas the dikes are the result of sediment settling. The pool-riffle sequences occur by the reduction of the flow velocity in some places, and, in others, by the presence of woody debris. In some parts of the river where are rock outcrop was observed the formation of <b>pot-hole...</b>|$|E
