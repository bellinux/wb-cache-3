To be considered as a [...] "quality wine", the wine must come from a specified region and be associated with a [...] "geographical indication" [...] or appellation: indeed, the technical term used in the Regulation is quality wine psr, with the [...] "psr" [...] standing for [...] "produced in a specified region".

In this paper we propose that one feasible and fair way to address this problem is to tax animal <b>products</b> <b>obtained</b> with the use of antibiotics. We argue that such tax is supported both by a) deontological arguments, which are based on the duty individuals have to compensate society for the antibiotic resistance to which they are contributing through consumption of animal <b>products</b> <b>obtained</b> with the use of antibiotics; and b) a cost-benefit analysis of taxing such animal products and of using revenue from the tax to fund alternatives to use of antibiotics in animal farming.

40|$|Background. In Italy, the {{financial}} reimbursement for labile blood components exchanged between Regions is regulated by national tariffs defined in 1991 and updated in 1993 - 2003. Over {{the last five}} years, the need for establishing standard costs of healthcare services has arisen critically. In this perspective, {{the present study is}} aimed at defining both the costs of production of blood components and the related prices, as well as the prices of plasma-derived medicinal <b>products</b> <b>obtained</b> by national plasma, to be used for interregional financial reimbursement. Materials and methods. In order to analyse the costs of production of blood components, 12 out 318 blood establishments were selected in 8 Italian Regions. For each step of the production process, driving costs were identified and production costs were. To define the costs of plasma-derived medicinal <b>products</b> <b>obtained</b> by national plasma, industrial costs currently sustained by National Health Service for contract fractionation were taken into account. Results. The production costs of plasma-derived medicinal <b>products</b> <b>obtained</b> from national plasma showed a huge variability among blood establishments, which was much lower after standardization. The new suggested plasma tariffs were quite similar to those currently in force. Comparing the overall costs theoretically sustained by the National Health Service for plasma-derived medicinal <b>products</b> <b>obtained</b> from national plasma to current commercial costs, demonstrates that the national blood system could gain a 10...|$|R
