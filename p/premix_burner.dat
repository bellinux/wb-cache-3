As for the <b>premixed</b> <b>burner,</b> pollutant emissions have been related with thermal characterization of the reactant zone performed by thin thermocouples.

40|$|In Part I of this paper, a multiple-input, single-output (MISO) {{model for}} the {{dynamics}} of practical premixed flames has been proposed. A corresponding method for identification of model coefficients was developed and validated against test data generated with a linear time-domain model, designed to be qualitatively representative of a practical <b>premix</b> <b>burner.</b> The method for system identification of a MISO model is now applied to time series data generated with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation {{in the presence of}} broadband forcing. The CFD model represents a generic, practical premixed swirl burner with multiple fuel injection stages. Fuel injectors are assumed to be acoustically “non-stiff”, such that pressure fluctuations will modulate the fuel mass flow rates. The flame dynamics is therefore influenced by fluctuations of the equivalence ratio as well as the mass flow rate of premixture at the burner exit. Results obtained demonstrate that system identification based on correlation analysis is well capable of differentiating between the various interaction mechanisms. Unit impulse and flame transfer functions corresponding to different signal-response relations can be determined in a quantitative manner from a single CFD run. A detailed analysis and physical interpretation of the response functions has been carried out.

40|$|Large Eddy Simulation (LES) {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} useful tool for the prediction of turbulent reactive flows with the increasing availability of cheaper and faster computing power. In the context of premixed combustion, LES encounters the challenge of resolving the flame thickness, which is normally smaller than the filter width used in typical engineering applications. This thesis considers the Flame Surface Density (FSD) approach to provide closure to the filtered LES reaction rate. The FSD can either be modelled algebraically (FSDA) or determined through a transport equation (FSDT) and both approaches are investigated in the LES of three different test cases. The first case explores the response of different FSDA models towards changes in turbulence levels, and compares the instantaneous flame structures and reaction rates predicted by FSDA and FSDT methods. The remaining cases examine the LES of two turbulent <b>premixed</b> <b>burners.</b> A relatively large range of FSDA models are tested under the same operating conditions for the first time, and the LES-FSDT equation is applied to premixed flames that involve {{a higher level of}} geometric complexity than earlier work. Generally, the results show that the performance of some FSDA models are inconsistent between the two <b>premixed</b> <b>burners,</b> suggesting that the models may operate optimally under different turbulent conditions. By contrast, the consistently good agreement of the FSDT results with experiments suggests that the method has much potential in the LES modelling of turbulent premixed flames. However, the improved FSDT predictions were dependent on the value of the model constant within the sub-grid curvature model, and the value yielded an additional dependency on filter width. For these reasons {{as well as for the}} higher computational expense, the effective use of FSDT requires further development, while the application of the FSDA models remains a viable alternative to the FSDT approach.

40|$|The {{effect of}} bluff body on {{stabilization}} of {{liquid petroleum gas}} (LPG) - air <b>premixed</b> <b>burner</b> flame has been experimentally investigated. One of the objectives of this experimental work was to perform an analysis {{on the effect of}} the bluff-body shape on flame stabilization. A method of aerodynamically stabilizing lean premixed natural gas flames on a conventional burner was investigated. The analysis of premixed flames stabilization process was focusing mainly on the shape and sizes of flame holders. To study the influence of the bluff-body shape on the stabilization process, four flame-holders were considered: a rod, a wire and rings of several diameters. Flames were anchored in the wake behind a small ring placed in the exit plane of a conventional burner. The stabilization conditions were based on the description of the stability domain and of the characteristic flame modes. Direct visualizations allow a better knowledge of these different regimes: laminar stable flame, transition and unstable flame. An aerothermodynamic description of the reacting flow in the bluff-body wake was performed over a range of Reynolds numbers and mixture equivalence ratios. The objective was to extract from this analysis, the differences in the flame structure due to the bluff-body geometry and their consequences on the stabilization diagram. Results show the existence of various types of flames, according to the classical <b>premixed</b> <b>burner</b> flame, but the influence of the bluff-body shape on these stabilization regimes is also demonstrated. Comparison between the flow without bluff body and with bluff body on flow as well as flame stabilization was discussed. It was found that the stabilization of the flame is improved by having bluff bodies on downstream of the flow. Without bluff body the stability region of the flame is limited or in general the flame is easier to blow off and flashback. The overall with bluff body stability regime of the burner was significantly increased, permitting stable lean premixed combustion. The influence of the ring with different diameters on flame stability limit was also investigated...|$|R

We find that significant turbulent fluctuations are introduced mainly in the energy-containing range and partially also in the inertial subrange. These additional fluctuations represent up to 25 % of the total energy and are not caused by pulsations of the mean flow.

Specifically the aims are set at flame stability and pollutions. Important part of this paper is a novel design procedure dealing with <b>premixed</b> <b>burners.</b> Further, by exploiting the results of testing program enabled one to design burners exhibiting low level of nitrogen oxides emissions. On the basis of aerodynamic analysis of <b>premixed</b> <b>burners</b> flow path several recommendations on the geometry resulted in proposing two ejectors, which transport the combustion air. In the first ejector the fuel jet, generated by flow through a nozzle, draws the specified part of the combustion air, and then the mixture is a driving agent of the second ejector. The remaining part of combustion air flows first through the radial curved vanes, and second its tangential velocity component is augmented by axial vanes prior it enters mixing part of the second ejector. For the additional contribution to the rotating motion the inclined axial vanes built inside the nozzle of the second ejector are responsible. The resulting swirling number reaches the values up to 2. 6. For the burner so arranged fire stability and low NOx emissions in the wide operating conditions can be expected. Within the frame of extensive testing program in the field of diffusion burners several modifications have been carried out such as setting of axial vanes which secure the swirling motion, changes of combustion air flows path, and modifications of secondary nozzles, these resulted in extending zone of stabilized flame and reducing the formation of NOx, e. g.

Flame stabilisation {{has been one of}} the main issues in small scale combustion systems due to higher surface to volume ratio associated with small size of the combustor. Previous research has shown that catalytic combustion is one way of improving flame stabilisation, however employing a catalyst into the system increases the manufacturing cost which can be a significant downside. This research work studies flame stabilisation mechanisms in meso-scale burner which mainly focuses on Backward Facing Step or Sudden Expansion Step and secondary air addition into the combustion chamber. A 250 W <b>premixed</b> <b>burner</b> was developed which was classified as a meso scale burner whose operating parameters were in a range of micro-combustors whereas the size was comparatively bigger due to its integration with standard size thermoelectric modules. The first phase of the research was concerned with development of the burner which included optimisation of the design to achieve a stable enclosed premixed flame as per the design and operational requirements. It was found that flame blowoff can be prevented by addition of secondary air into the combustion chamber downstream of the step. The second phase of the research focused on the integration of the burner with thermoelectric power generators. This involved investigation of various configurations to optimise the electrical power output. The burner integrated thermoelectric unit was then tested in the actual field to validate the concept of integrating combustion and thermoelectrics for small scale power generation applications. The final phase of the research involved a study on the effect of secondary air addition on flame stabilisation in burners employing backward facing step.

In {{the first part of this}} study, the Authors present the future scenario of the grid gas composition and the implications on gas fed appliances. Given that the widely used <b>premixed</b> <b>burners</b> are currently designed mainly by trial and error, a broader fuel gas quality range means an additional hitch on this design process. A better understanding and structuring of this process is helpful for future appliance-oriented developments. The Authors present an experimental activity on a premixed condensing boiler setup. A test protocol highlighting the burners' flexibility in terms of mixture composition is adopted and the system fuel flexibility is characterized around multiple reference conditions...|$|R
