25|$|The {{official}} {{investigation by}} the Civil Aeronautics Board concluded that a failure in the <b>propeller</b> <b>governor</b> of engine No. 3 caused the propeller to go into reverse during climb-out. The engine was left running at high power, while engine No. 4 was mistakenly feathered. Under such conditions, the aircraft was {{no longer able to}} maintain altitude and descended into the ground.|$|E

50|$|Several {{scenarios}} were {{suggested in}} the inquiry. One such suggestion was an engine failure, however after {{an investigation of the}} power plants and the <b>propeller</b> <b>governors,</b> this idea was eliminated. It was also suggested that the landing gear may have been operated incorrectly, however the inquiry established that the nose wheel and starboard undercarriage were up and locked, and whilst they could not definitely prove that the port undercarriage was up and locked, the board decided that it was likely up and locked.|$|R
50|$|The journey {{began in}} Rockford, Illinois in 1870 with Amos W. Woodward's {{invention}} of a noncompensating mechanical waterwheel governor (U.S. patent No. 103,813). Thirty years later his son, Elmer, patented {{the first successful}} mechanical compensating governor for hydraulic turbines (U.S. patent No. 583,527). In 1933, the company became more diversified by expanding its product line to include diesel engine controls (U.S. patent No. 2,039,507) and aircraft <b>propeller</b> <b>governors</b> (British patent No. 470,284). Woodward governors followed the rapid advancement of diesel engine applications for railroads, maritime and electrical generation in many fields. The advent of gas turbine engines for aircraft and industrial uses offered still more opportunities for Woodward designed fuel controls. And, of course, the science of electronics has added impetus to this industry.|$|R

5000|$|The {{power of}} both engines was {{controlled}} by a single [...] "power lever" [...] in all flight regimes. To provide crisp thrust control during hover, movement of the power lever caused a direct adjustment of blade angle, analogous to the collective pitch control of a helicopter, with the <b>propeller</b> cpu <b>governor</b> making a follow-up adjustment of blade angle to maintain the selected rpm. The direct adjustment of blade angle was faded out automatically as the blade angle increased with increasing forward speed.|$|R
50|$|Osaka was {{the second}} largest city in Japan, with a {{population}} of 3,252,340 in 1940. Traditionally, it was the most important industrial concentration in the Far East. Osaka was one of the principal centers of heavy industry, noted for its shipbuilding, iron, steel, rolling stock works, as well as non-ferrous metals enterprises (notably copper and aluminum). In addition, it was outstanding for its production of aircraft <b>propellers</b> and <b>governors,</b> munitions and ordnance, textiles, special steels, wires, electrical equipment, chemicals, instruments, and machines and machine tools, particularly anti-friction bearings. It had also become a transportation center, and ranked third as a port. Much work had been done to develop its naturally shallow harbor. Lastly, it was the center of an extensive system of railways.|$|R

2500|$|The non-fatal {{incident}} occurred on 8 May 1951. It involved a Hunting Air Travel Vickers 639 Viking 1 (registration: G-AHPD) operating an international scheduled passenger flight from Bordeaux Mérignac to RAF Bovingdon. Following an uneventful takeoff from Mérignac, the no. 1 engine suddenly {{began to lose}} power when the aircraft climbed through [...] and the pilot in command throttled down to initial climbing speed. The pilot then shut down the malfunctioning engine, feathered the propeller and applied full power to the no. 2 engine {{to compensate for the}} loss of engine no. 1. However, this was insufficient to maintain altitude and led to the flightdeck crew's decision to execute a gear-up landing. When the aircraft touched the ground, it slid for about [...] before coming to a halt. There were no fatalities among the 32 occupants (five crew and 27 passengers). Accident investigators established the probable cause as the disconnecting of the articulated control rod of the <b>propeller</b> <b>governor</b> {{due to the lack of}} a split pin on the governor spindle, and due to the nut of the ball joint of the control spindle having been unscrewed by force.|$|E

50|$|Propeller Control - Used to set {{the desired}} {{propeller}} speed.

50|$|A constant-speed unit (CSU) or <b>propeller</b> <b>governor</b> is {{the device}} fitted {{to one of}} these {{propellers}} to automatically change its pitch so as to attempt to keep engine speed constant. Most engines produce their maximum power in a narrow speed band. The CSU can be said to be to an aircraft what the CVT is to the motorcar: the engine can be kept running at its optimum speed, no matter at what speed the aircraft is flying through the air. The advent of the CSU had another benefit: it allowed the designers of aircraft engines to keep ignition systems simple; the automatic spark advance seen in motor vehicle engines is simplified in aircraft engines.|$|E
