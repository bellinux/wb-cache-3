50|$|The Three-Roll Push Bending (TRPB) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used freeform-bending process to manufacture bending geometries consisting of several <b>plane</b> <b>bending</b> curves. Nevertheless, a 3D-shaping is possible. The profile is guided between bending-roll and supporting-roll(s), while being pushed through the tools. The position of the forming-roll defines the bending radius. The bending point is the tangent-point between tube and bending-roll. To change the bending plane, the pusher rotates the tube around its longitudinal axis. Generally, a TRPB tool kit can be applied on a conventional rotary draw bending machine. The process is very flexible since with a unique tool set, several bending radii values Rm can be obtained, although the geometrical precision of the process is not comparable to rotary draw bending. Bending contours defined as spline- or polynomial-functions can be manufactured.|$|E

Deep beam effect is not seen in bending theory based on assumptions that transverse sections which are <b>plane</b> before <b>bending</b> remain <b>plane</b> after <b>bending.</b> MIF gives correct result for both shallow and deep beams. In this method we need not apply corrections. Also in this method {{it is not necessary to}} assume the position of neutral axis; it incorporates the position of neutral axis by itself.

Unfortunately, gas quality is expected to affect metrological performance of thermal mass flow-meters (TMFs), as far as flow disturbances and such conditions often occur in modern networks. In this paper the authors investigate the sensitivity of TMFs with natural gas quality changes and different flow disturbances. To this end, a metrological test campaign {{has been carried out}} through specifically designed laboratory test bench and facilities. The results of the tests with gas quality changes show the capillary TMFs are able to recognize the natural gas flowing strictly included in the EN 437 group H and to consequently apply specific correction factors. On the other hand, capillary TMFs have been found sensitive to high contents of CO 2 and N 2, like in biogas and natural gases at the borders of group H.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the thermomechanical phenomena during the laser bending process, a simulation is performed. The governing thermoelastic-plastic equations are integrated by the finite element method. The results are related to predictions as given by the so-called temperature gradient mechanism (TGM), which is often used {{in the context of}} laser bending. It turns out that approximative identical temperature time cycles result in a plane and a prebended sheet in completely different forming behavior, whereby the forming behavior for the bended sheet depends on which side is laser treated. This means that a quantification of the extension and homogeneity of laser generated temperature field is insufficient for the prediction of forming behavior.

CBS results were obtained by extrapolating a power function (two-parameter formula) to the results calculated with polarization-consistent basis sets. Anharmonic corrections using the second order perturbation treatment (PT 2) and hybrid B 3 LYP functional combined with polarization consistent pc-n (n[*]=[*] 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) and several Pople’s basis sets were analyzed for all fundamental formamide vibrational modes in the gas phase and solution.
