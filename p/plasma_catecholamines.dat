40|$|International audienceAbstract Excess {{body fat}} in obese {{individuals}} {{can affect the}} catecholamine response to various stimuli. Indeed, several studies report lower <b>plasma</b> <b>catecholamine</b> concentrations in obese subjects compared with nonobese subjects in response to submaximal or maximal exercise. This low catecholamine response reflects decreased sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. Although {{the relationship between the}} SNS and obesity is not well established, some authors have suggested that low SNS activity may {{contribute to the development of}} obesity. A decreased catecholamine response could affect ?- and ?-adrenoceptor sensitivity in adipose tissue, reducing lipolysis and increasing fat stores. Few studies have examined the effects of obesity on the <b>plasma</b> <b>catecholamine</b> response at rest and during exercise in adolescents. It is interesting to note that the effects of age, sexand degree of obesity and the impact of very intense exercise on the catecholamine response have not yet been well examined. Moreover, the hormonal concentrations measured in the majority of obesity studies did not take into account plasma volume changes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Contrast-enhanced {{computed}} tomography (CT) {{is useful for}} localizing pheochromocytoma. However, in patients with suspected pheochromocytoma, CT is often canceled or not performed because of the strong belief that intravenous contrast may induce hypertensive crisis. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether intravenous low-osmolar contrast administration during CT induces catecholamine release that increases blood pressure or heart rate. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. PARTICIPANTS: 22 patients with pheochromocytoma (15 nonadrenal and 7 adrenal) and 8 unmatched control participants without pheochromocytoma. MEASUREMENTS: <b>Plasma</b> <b>catecholamine</b> levels, blood pressure, and heart rate. RESULTS: <b>Plasma</b> <b>catecholamine</b> levels within and between groups did not significantly differ before and after intravenous administration of low-osmolar CT contrast. Patients with pheochromocytoma experienced a clinically and statistically significant increase in diastolic blood pressure that was not accompanied by corresponding increases in <b>plasma</b> <b>catecholamine</b> levels. The difference became non-statistically significant after adjustment for use of alpha- and beta-blockers. Limitation: The study lacked a placebo group, and the sample was relatively small. CONCLUSION: Intravenous low-osmolar contrast-enhanced CT can safely be used in patients with pheochromocytoma who are not receiving alpha- or beta-blockers.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the frequency of}} pheochromocytoma in patients with incidentally discovered adrenal masses (incidentalomas) and to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of the Glucagon test in comparison with resting <b>plasma</b> <b>catecholamines,</b> 89 patients with adrenal incidentalomas (age range 23 - 80 yr; 41 males and 48 females) were studied. Fifty-seven patients were normotensive (SBP 130 ± 1. 8 mmHg; DBP 80 ± 0. 7 mmHg, mean ± SE) and 32 had stable hypertension (SEP 155 ± 3. 3 mmHg, DBP 93 ± 1. 4 mmHg) : no patient complained of typical signs or symptoms of pheochromocytoma. Resting plasma samples for noradrenaline and adrenaline determination and, at appropriate intervals, the Glucagon test(1 mg i. v.), were performed in all subjects. Diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was {{made on the basis}} of humoral evaluations and/or surgical intervention in 6 patients (6. 7 %), of whom 3 hypertensives and 3 normotensives. Resting <b>plasma</b> <b>catecholamines</b> revealed 5 out of 6 patients with pheochromocytoma: in 3 cases both catecholamines were above the normal range, in 1 only adrenaline was elevated and in 1 case only noradrenaline.
