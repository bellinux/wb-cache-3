500|$|Sadie's Story {{was created}} by Fourth Wall Studios in {{partnership}} with Staten and artist Ashley Wood. Fourth Wall Studios was formed by former members of 42 Entertainment, who produced the highly successful I Love Bees alternate reality game to promote Halo 2. Recalled Staten, [...] "we realized that in Halo we do a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> describing the clash of these military industrial complexes, {{but it really is}} the soldiers' story," [...] and Halo 3: ODST offered a chance {{to take a look at}} the unexplored civilian story.|$|E
500|$|In The Curse of Monkey Island, Elaine realises that Guybrush is {{her true}} love, and marries him. However, Ron Gilbert {{did not intend}} for the {{relationship}} between the characters to develop in this way, stating that Elaine [...] "never really liked Guybrush and thought of him as more of a little brother". Gilbert was not involved in the production of The Curse of Monkey Island; while thinking that the new development team [...] "did a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> capturing [...] what Monkey Island was about", the relationship between Elaine and Guybrush [...] "was the thing that bugged [...] the most about The Curse of Monkey Island".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{critical}} success, the third season of Parks and Recreation continued to suffer in the Nielsen ratings, {{just as it}} had during the second season. The average viewership for the 16 episodes of season three were 4.75 million household viewers, a slight increase over season two's 4.68 million average, but lower than season one's average of 5.45 million households. Michael Schur partially attributed the continually low viewership to a decline in ratings for NBC in general, as well as changing viewer trends due to a large amount of available channels. He added: [...] "I would love it if our ratings went up and up, and we've done a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> making our show inviting and friendly, welcoming to new viewers. Other than that, I'm not sure what else we can do. It’s very disconcerting." ...|$|E
5000|$|Years later, Dave Stewart {{described}} Davis as the [...] "best fifth starter Stewart {{had ever}} seen....Davis pitched 165-170 innings (actually 169), won 19 games (19-7) and {{spent some time}} doing a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> out <b>of</b> the bullpen, too. Storm was the perfect fifth starter." [...] Stewart's high opinion of Davis' 1989 season is not shared by sabermetrician Bill James, who cites Davis' 19-7 winning record as a canonical example of how a pitcher's won-lost record can be misleading.|$|R

The AI aircraft are up to the task and do a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> - but at the same time, the enemy aircraft AI are also doing a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> attacking the allies.|$|R

500|$|There {{are fewer}} reviews from {{newspapers}} outside the United Kingdom and United States, but those available are generally positive. Writing for Australia's The Sydney Morning Herald Alexander Downer, {{who served as}} Foreign Minister in the Government of John Howard gave A Journey a favourable review: [...] "His [...] commitment to humanity is sincere and convincing, and his personality infectiously amiable with a delightful sense of self-deprecating humour." [...] Konrad Yakabuski, a senior political writer for Canada's The Globe and Mail was also positive: [...] "If Tony Blair has not continued to agonize over the tough decisions of his prime ministership, he does a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> persuading otherwise in A Journey." [...] India's English language daily The Hindu said of the book, [...] "It {{is by no means}} a confessional memoir but a brave attempt with only patchy success at self-justification." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{garnered}} generally mixed {{to positive}} reception from music critics, {{most of whom}} noted that the song may be taken offensively because of its stereotypical lyrics. The song {{has been described as}} a [...] "plaintive ballad" [...] by Joseph Woodard of Entertainment Weekly. San Francisco-based non-profit organization, Common Sense Media gave the song a mixed review, stating that it should remain an album track rather than a single. They stated, [...] "With Beyoncé doing a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> phonetically singing in Spanish (the occasional verb phrase doesn't blend), this is more about novelty than about being a great single." [...] Agustin Gurza of the Los Angeles Times gave the song a positive review, naming it a stand-out track off of Alejandro's Viento a favor. Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic complimented the writing as well as the production on the song and called it [...] "over-bearing in a positive way." [...] As a positive spoof of the song's premiere on Zorro: La Espada y la Rosa, Billboard created a wanted poster for Fernández, which stated he was wanted [...] "for stealing the hearts of millions" [...] with his performance in the song.|$|E
2500|$|Brian Tallerico, from RogerEbert.com, {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four: [...] "It's a movie {{designed}} to simultaneously challenge viewers, move them and get them talking. For the most part, it succeeds." [...] At Time.com, Sam Lansky described it as [...] "sophisticated, grownup sci-fi: a movie about aliens for people who don't like movies about aliens." [...] IGN reviewer Chris Tilly gave it a score of 8.5 out of 10, saying: [...] "Arrival is a language lesson masquerading as a blockbuster, though much more entertaining than that sounds...it's smart, sophisticated sci-fi that asks BIG questions, and does a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> answering them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter {{said that}} Oonga [...] "does a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> {{explaining}} why the regional {{police and the}} Naxalites, Maoist-inspired guerrillas coming from native tribes, are in a standoff in modern India"; she also praised the cinematography and the actors.|$|R

2500|$|The {{album cover}} {{received}} widespread attention when, at a February 1970 gig in Copenhagen, the band were billed as [...] "The Nobs" [...] {{as the result}} of a legal threat from aristocrat Eva von Zeppelin (a relative of the creator of the Zeppelin aircraft). Von Zeppelin, upon seeing the logo of the Hindenburg crashing in flames, threatened to have the show pulled off the air. In 2001, Greg Kot wrote in Rolling Stone that [...] "The cover of Led Zeppelin … shows the Hindenburg airship, in all its phallic glory, going down in flames. The image did a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> encapsulating the music inside: sex, catastrophe and things blowing up." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Hanson gave {{a mostly}} {{favorable}} review {{to the book}} Colossus by the British historian Niall Ferguson, where Ferguson argued that the United States should be an imperial power {{in the sense of}} preserving the post war order of global free trade, communications, and commerce, and the principal problem with Americans was that they were unwilling to embrace global leadership {{in the same way that}} people in 19th century Britain did. Hanson found much to approve of in Ferguson's book, writing: [...] "In reality, we should be natural imperialists, given our wealth and expertise. Americans are also endowed with an exceptional moral sense. We are a generous people, whose checkered imperial interventions in the past rarely proved profitable or exploitive." [...] Hanson agreed with Ferguson that the principle problem with Americans was an unease at playing the role of an imperialistic power, argued that post-1945 histories of Germany and Japan proved the beneficial results of American occupation and predicted that Iraq under American occupation would become just as much a prosperous and democratic society as Germany and Japan are. Hanson praised Ferguson for his defense of the British Empire as a benevolent force and his thesis that the United States should play the same role in the world as the British Empire, writing: [...] "Does Ferguson propose a new American liberal empire? In fact, he does almost, but not before noting that the British Victorians themselves got a bad rap as exploitive colonialists. In fact, the record of the 18th and 19th centuries prove exactly the opposite: Former and once-prosperous colonies, following autonomy, quickly turned into self-induced miseries, while Britain itself thrived as never before once free of these costly obligations. Empire turns out not to be a means of making money, but instead an idealist pursuit to keep sea lanes open, bullies at bay and nations trading rather than fighting. The world has been lucky to have the Americans fill this vacuum, inasmuch as the British once did a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> it as well." [...] Hanson, well before the immigration and financial crises of the EU, also praised Ferguson for his very negative picture of the European Union as being both [...] "busy triangulating with our enemies" [...] and [...] "running huge trade deficits with us as we supply their own security needs." [...] He cites appears to agree with Ferguson that Europe is undemocratic, and statist, but that with a population in decline and even worse entitlement overspending than the US, a more broken melting pot, and socialist response to these issues ensuring Europe will be unable generate the unity or idealism required to supplant the US.|$|E

60|$|It wasn't {{necessary}} for your chairman {{to apologize for}} me in Germany. It wasn't necessary at all. Instead of {{that he ought to}} have impressed upon those poor benighted Teutons the service I rendered them. Their language had needed untangling for a good many years. Nobody else seemed to want to take the job, and so I took it, and I flatter myself that I made a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> it. The Germans have an inhuman way of cutting up their verbs. Now a verb has a hard time enough of it in this world when it's all together. It's downright inhuman to split it up. But that's just what those Germans do. They take part of a verb and put it down here, like a stake, and they take the other part of it and put it away over yonder like another stake, and between these two limits they just shovel in German. I maintain that there is no necessity for apologizing for a man who helped in a small way to stop such mutilation.|$|E

If your luck has equalled mine the thing is done, and Wheal Dooem, as I have named the sweet little thing, will be going full swing {{in a couple of}} weeks--costing, perhaps, a few hundreds to put it in working order, with a trifle thereafter in the shape of wages to a man and a boy to coal the fire, and keep the thing moving with as much noise as possible to make a show, and leaving a pretty little balance of some twenty or thirty thousand at the credit of the Company, for you and me to enjoy in the meantime--minus a small sum for rent of office, clerk's salary, gas and coal, etcetera, as long as the bubble lasts." ...|$|E

I didn't exactly want {{to show it to}} Mrs. Lynde. Mrs. Lynde is a good, kind woman, but she isn't the sort of person you want to show your mother's picture to. YOU know, teacher. But of course I obeyed Grandma. Mrs. Lynde said she was very pretty but kind of actressy looking, and must have been an awful lot younger than father. Then she said, 'Some of these days your pa will be marrying again likely. How will you like to have a new ma, Master Paul?' Well, the idea almost took my breath away, teacher, but I wasn't going to let Mrs. Lynde see THAT. I just looked her straight in the face [...] . like this [...] . and I said, 'Mrs. Lynde, father made a <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> picking out my first mother and I could trust him to pick out just as good a one the second time.' And I CAN trust him, teacher. But still, I hope, if he ever does give me a new mother, he'll ask my opinion about her before it's too late. There's Mary Joe coming to call us to tea.
