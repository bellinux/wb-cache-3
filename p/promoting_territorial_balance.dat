40|$|Using {{annual data}} for 13 European {{countries}} {{over the period}} 1980 - 2008, we {{assess the impact of}} national fiscal consolidations on the income inequality of European regions. Regional dispersion increases in the outcome of consolidation episodes, particularly, when packages are more severe and implemented through spending cuts rather than tax rises. From a policy perspective, these findings suggest that fiscal consolidations driven by reductions in government spending can exacerbate regional disparities and may ultimately counteract the European policy efforts to <b>promote</b> <b>territorial</b> cohesion. Our results are robust to alternative inequality measures, the occurrence of crisis episodes and the exclusion of fiscal outliers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{development}} of any region or territory stems {{from its own}} dynamic nature. Economic activity and employment are stimulated {{by the number of}} local initiatives plus the cross-fertilisation of those same initiatives. Globalisation, external constraints and technological change are therefore not really obstacles to be overcome but rather opportunities to be seized. In our experience, participatory foresight exercise using simple and appropriate methods {{has proved to be a}} powerful lever for <b>promoting</b> <b>territorial</b> dynamics. G iven the overwhelming popularity of the term, globalisation should be defined here as integration within the major regions of the world. Yet integration in those regions may not be all that new; for example, French companies may well export 25 per cent of their production...|$|R
