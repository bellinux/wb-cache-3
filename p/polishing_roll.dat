50|$|The {{finish of}} the rolled product is {{controlled}} by using rolls having a variety of surface finishes designed to impart the desired finish to the product. Roll finishes range from ground and <b>polished</b> <b>rolls</b> to impart a bright finish, to shot-blasted or electric-discharged textured rolls that produce a dull, velvety finish on the steel surface.|$|R
60|$|Upon {{the island}} still stand noble beeches, oaks, and chestnuts--trees {{that long ago}} have covered up their bullet-scars, but they could tell, had they the power to speak, many a wild thrilling tale. Beautiful parks and stately mansions grace the island; and <b>polished</b> equipages <b>roll</b> over the ground that once knew naught save the soft tread of the deer and the moccasin.|$|R

50|$|This is {{a limited}} run (35 units) of the Phantom Coupé, {{inspired}} by Supermarine S6B (powered by a Rolls-Royce R Type engine). It included Aviator Grey body colour, a contrasting matt bonnet, window and grille surround, Thommen aviation-grade clock with blood orange needle tips embedded in the metal foil upper fascia and matt black dials, mahogany lower fascia with Sapele contrast, polished stainless steel veneer 'onlays' with bullet-shaped ends, leather-lined glove compartment, centre console chrome plaque describing Charles <b>Rolls,</b> <b>polished</b> aluminium cup holders.|$|R
5000|$|... "Bulke" [...] or [...] "Bilke" [...] (the final [...] "e" [...] is pronounced) is the Yiddish {{word for}} a small roll made with fine wheat flour and kneaded with eggs. [...] "Bulkie" [...] is also a <b>Polish</b> word for <b>rolls,</b> from which the Yiddish term may be derived given the large pre-World War II Jewish {{population}} in Poland. But, whatever the etymological overlap among Eastern European dialects’ word for “Roll,” the [...] "Bulkie" [...] is undeniably a Polish working-class culinary delight and a Polish contribution to the vast New England food culture.|$|R
50|$|The {{function}} of Nok terracotta sculptures is still unknown. For the most part, the terracotta is {{preserved in the}} form of scattered fragments. That is why Nok art is well known today only for the heads, both male and female, whose hairstyles are particularly detailed and refined. The statues are in fragments because the discoveries are usually made from alluvial mud, in terrain made by the erosion of water. The terracotta statues found there are hidden, <b>rolled,</b> <b>polished,</b> and broken. Rarely are works of great size conserved intact making them highly valued on the international art market.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a tribute}} to the 1968 California Special, Ford added a limited {{production}} factory GT/California Special in 2007. The GT/CS is based on a Mustang GT with a 4.6 liter engine. The GT/CS option adds 2 tone seats (Dove or Parchment inserts), unique floor mats, side stripes (with GT/CS behind the front wheel RH and LH), side scoops (behind doors), 18" [...] <b>polished</b> aluminum wheels, <b>rolled</b> exhaust tips, faux gas cap (with words [...] "California Special"), lowered front bumper/valance and unique rear bumper. The GT/CS was available as a coupe or convertible, with manual or automatic transmission. The GT/California Special package had an MSRP of $1,895.00.|$|R
60|$|For half an {{hour after}} the <b>Polish</b> leader had <b>rolled</b> himself in his cloak and gone off to sleep, the boys chatted {{together}} as to the course they should adopt, and finally resolved to throw in their fortunes with those of the Polish patriots. They saw that it would be impossible for them to make their way on to the frontier alone, and considered that their chance of life was no less if captured in action by the Russians than if found in a village with a number of wounded insurgents. The wrongs of Poland were in those days a subject which moved men's hearts in England, and the midshipmen rejoiced at the thought of striking a blow in so good a cause.|$|R
5000|$|Variety {{gave the}} film a mixed review stating the film had a [...] "cold, steely blue, black and gray 'Matrix'-y look" [...] {{going on to}} say Daybreakers [...] "emerges as a {{competent}} but routine chase thriller that lacks attention-getting dialogue, unique characters or memorable setpieces that might make it a genre keeper rather than a <b>polished</b> time-filler." [...] <b>Rolling</b> Stone gave the film {{two and a half}} out of four stars and called the film a B movie and a [...] "nifty genre piece". Roger Ebert also gave the film {{two and a half stars}} stating the [...] "intriguing premise ... ends as so many movies do these days, with fierce fights and bloodshed." [...] Richard Roeper gave the film a B+ and called it [...] "a bloody good time." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas living near the east coast used pieces of shell as wampum. The channeled whelk (Busycotypus canaliculatus) and the quahog (Mercenaria mercenaria) were used to make white and purple traditional patterns. The shells were cut, <b>rolled,</b> <b>polished</b> and drilled before being strung together and woven into belts. These were used for personal, social and ceremonial purposes and also, at a later date, for currency. The Winnebago Tribe from Wisconsin had numerous uses for freshwater mussels including using them as spoons, cups, ladles and utensils. They notched them to provide knives, graters and saws. They carved them into fish hooks and lures. They incorporated powdered shell into clay to temper their pottery vessels. They used them as scrapers for removing flesh from hides and for separating the scalps of their victims. They used shells as scoops for gouging out fired logs when building canoes and they drilled holes in them and fitted wooden handles for tilling the ground.|$|R
40|$|Equilibrium {{equation}} of state theory predicts that the free surface release temperature of shock loaded tin will show a plateau of 505 K in the pressure range from 19. 5 to 33. 0 GPa, corresponding to the solid-liquid mixed-phase region. In this paper we report free surface temperature measurements on shock-loaded tin from 15 to 31 GPa using multi-wavelength optical pyrometry. The shock waves were generated by direct contact of detonating high explosive with the sample. The pressure in the sample was determined by free surface velocity measurements using Photon Doppler Velocimetry. The emitted thermal radiance was measured at four wavelength bands in the near IR region from 1. 5 to 5. 0 {micro}m. The samples {{in most of the}} experiments had diamond-turned surface finishes, with a few samples being <b>polished</b> or ball <b>rolled.</b> At pressures higher than 25 GPa the measured free surface temperatures were higher than the predicted 505 K and increased with increasing pressure. This deviation could be explained by hot spots and/or variations in surface emissivity and requires a further investigation...|$|R
500|$|Anastasia's daring {{occasionally}} {{exceeded the}} limits of acceptable behavior. [...] "She undoubtedly held the record for punishable deeds in her family, for in naughtiness she was a true genius", said Gleb Botkin, son of the court physician Yevgeny Botkin, who later died with the family at Yekaterinburg. Anastasia sometimes tripped the servants and played pranks on her tutors. As a child, she would climb trees and refuse to come down. Once, during a snowball fight at the family's <b>Polish</b> estate, Anastasia <b>rolled</b> a rock into a snowball and threw it at her older sister Tatiana, knocking her to the ground. A distant cousin, Princess Nina Georgievna, recalled that [...] "Anastasia was nasty {{to the point of}} being evil", and would cheat, kick and scratch her playmates during games; she was affronted because the younger Nina was taller than she was. She was less concerned about her appearance than her sisters. Hallie Erminie Rives, a best-selling American author and wife of an American diplomat, described how 10-year-old Anastasia ate chocolates without bothering to remove her long, white opera gloves at the St. Petersburg opera house.|$|R
