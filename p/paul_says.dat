Diana tells him that she {{will have a lot}} of job offers in New York, but <b>Paul</b> <b>says</b> that no one will be interested as she is toxic. Diana's plane ticket is cancelled and she is thrown out of the hotel by Paul. She asks Declan for help and he tells her that Paul keeps his business papers in the home safe. Diana kisses Paul, {{and at the same time}} she takes his house keys from his pocket and she breaks into his house. Diana does not find anything and, in anger, she smashes Paul's possessions. Diana calls a mystery person and arranges for them to hurt Paul. She then goes to Rebecca and tells her about her husband's affair. Someone goes to the Lassiter's mezzanine and pushes Paul from it. Detective Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) discovers one of Diana's earrings at the scene and he stops her at the airport. During questioning, Diana tells him to speak to Rebecca again after revealing her affair with Paul. Andrew, Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) and Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) follow Diana and see her meeting with Jack Ward (Peter Lowrey), a hitman she called on the night Paul was pushed. Natasha retrieves Jack's phone and the group listen to a message left by Diana, telling him to leave town. Andrew confronts Diana at her hotel and Mark arrives to arrest her for conspiracy to commit murder. Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) receives some emails telling her that Diana did not push Paul and she goes to see her. Diana tells Susan that she has been formally charged, but insists that she is innocent. She realises that Susan believes her and she begs Susan to help. Diana is later released.|$|E

25|$|<b>Paul</b> <b>says</b> that {{contrary}} to what most Americans believe, {{access to health care}} is not a right, but a good whose value should be determined by the free market. In his view, government has no business in the delivery of health care. When government becomes involved, he says, costs rise and quality of care falls.|$|E

25|$|<b>Paul</b> <b>says</b> that a righteousness from God {{has made}} itself known {{apart from the}} law, to which the law and prophets testify, and this righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus to all who believe. He {{describes}} justification – legally clearing the believer of the guilt and penalty of sin – as a gift of God, and not the work of man (lest he might boast), but by faith.|$|E
25|$|The eternal {{election}} of God, however, vel praedestinatio (or predestination), that is, God's ordination to salvation, {{does not extend}} at once over the godly and the wicked, but only over the children of God, who were elected and ordained to eternal life before {{the foundation of the}} world was laid, as <b>Paul</b> <b>says,</b> Eph. 1:4. 5: He hath chosen us in Him, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|This episode {{featured}} a continuity error {{made in the}} final edit, in which Paul was shown to be fired after James, when in reality {{it had been the}} other way around, as James' luggage was still visible in reception when Paul left, yet Paul's was not when James departed. A further example of this mistake was that James could be still seen in the boardroom when <b>Paul</b> <b>says</b> his goodbyes to Tim, while James' departure reveals Paul's seat to be empty.|$|E
60|$|Paul said {{he thought}} not. Tozer replied that he thought not also, judging from Paul's looks, {{and that it was}} a pity, for it need be. He then asked Paul if he were going to begin with Cornelia; and on <b>Paul</b> <b>saying</b> 'yes,' all the young gentlemen (Briggs excepted) gave a low groan.|$|R

25|$|Paul {{additionally}} {{argues that}} government contributes to rising healthcare costs through yet other ways, such as through government regulations, one example being restrictions {{imposed by the}} Food and Drug Administration on the manufacture and sale of medications and dietary supplements, and through licensing of physicians and other healthcare practitioners, which <b>Paul</b> <b>says</b> interferes with market-based competition for healthcare services. He also criticizes the legal system's approach to the handling of medical malpractice claims, which he says needlessly inflates the cost of healthcare further still.|$|E
25|$|<b>Paul</b> <b>says</b> {{that when}} he entered medical {{practice}} in the early 1960s, before the Medicare and Medicaid programs were established, {{the poor and the}} elderly were hospitalized at about the same rates as they have been under Medicare and Medicaid in the 2000s, and that they received good care. He says further that in those days, doctors and hospitals provided cut-rate or free care to people who did not have health insurance – “every physician understood that he or she had a responsibility toward the less fortunate, and free medical care for the poor was the norm” – and that this was possible because healthcare costs were much lower. At a church charity hospital where he worked in his early years of practice, “nobody was turned away” for lack of ability to pay.|$|E
500|$|He terms himself [...] "strongly pro-life", [...] "an unshakable foe of abortion", and {{believes}} regulation or ban on medical decisions about maternal or fetal health is [...] "best handled {{at the state}} level". His abortion-related legislation, such as the Sanctity of Life Act, is intended to negate Roe v. Wade and to get [...] "the federal government {{completely out of the}} business of regulating state matters." [...] <b>Paul</b> <b>says</b> his years as an obstetrician led him to believe life begins at conception.|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{most common}} theodicy is the free will theodicy." [...] It lays {{the blame for}} all moral evil and some natural evil on {{humanity}}'s misuse of its free will. This article shows that the free will theodicy interacts with the Bible at its core: what Jesus and <b>Paul</b> <b>say</b> about {{the freedom of the}} will and with what kind of freedom of the will God endowed humanity at the Creation.|$|R
50|$|Having {{remained}} calm during Nora's distraction {{with a new}} man, Paul {{returns to}} the U.S. and proposes marriage to her. Nora realizes she is {{not in love with}} him and says so. Anne surprisingly declares her own love for <b>Paul,</b> <b>saying</b> {{when it comes to the}} heart, money shouldn't matter. Nora comes to her senses and returns to Roberto, saying she still intends to give all her money away, but to him.|$|R
5000|$|He quoted St <b>Paul</b> <b>saying</b> {{that young}} girls should marry, arguing that they [...] "should bear {{children}} to be mothers of families". Augustine {{was one of the}} first and most important Church fathers who wrote, that contraception is wrong: [...] "Intercourse even with one's legitimate wife is unlawful and wicked where the conception of the offspring is prevented. Onan, the son of Juda, did this and the Lord killed him for it." ...|$|R
500|$|Gregory {{seems to}} have {{believed}} in the universal salvation of all human beings. Gregory argues that when <b>Paul</b> <b>says</b> that God will be [...] "all in all" [...] (1 Cor. 15:28), this means that though some may need long time of purification, eventually [...] "no being will remain outside {{the number of the}} saved" [...] and that [...] "no being created by God will fall outside the Kingdom of God". Due to the unity of human nature in Christ “all, thanks to the union with one another, will be joined in communion with the Good, in Jesus Christ Our Lord”. By his incarnation, death and resurrection Christ achieves [...] "the common salvation of human nature".|$|E
500|$|The band is not musically polished. Paul has joked that, if {{they had}} known of the band’s popularity, they might have made [...] "an effort to sing in tune. But it’s hard to {{anticipate}} {{that sort of thing}} when you’re just writing silly songs and recording them in your living room over a weekend.". While musicianship is not the strength of the band, <b>Paul</b> <b>says</b> that the fans [...] "know we're not the best singers and keyboard players, but we're okay. And they think, well, I could do that, too. I think that’s really encouraging to people..." [...] Paul sees the brothers as a [...] "bridge between this mainstream phenomena of Harry Potter and the indie rock underground. Plus, we’re also pretty strong adherents to the DIY ideal." [...] The two brothers promote this ideal of making music independently and have fused the legions of fans on to the DIY free-for-all of indie rock and punk music, albeit of the silly kind.|$|E
500|$|Gifted {{players in}} the 1940s and the 1950s {{included}} centre-back Louis Carré and attackers Jef Mermans, Pol Anoul and Rik Coppens; at the 1954 World Cup, Anoul shone with three goals, and newspaper L'Équipe named Coppens the event's best centre forward. The 1960s and the early 1970s were {{the glory days of}} forward and four-time Belgian Golden Shoe Paul Van Himst, later elected Belgian UEFA Golden Player of 1954–2003 and Belgium's Player of the Century by IFFHS. At the 1965 Ballon d'Or, Van Himst ranked fourth, achieving Belgium's highest ever position at the European football election. Decades after Coppens and Van Himst had retired from playing football, a journalist on a Flemish television show asked them [...] "Who [...] was the best, actually?". Coppens replied: [...] "I will ask Paul that... If <b>Paul</b> <b>says</b> it was me, then he's right". In 1966, striker Raoul Lambert and defending midfielder Wilfried Van Moer joined the national team; while the UEFA praised Lambert for his skills at Euro 1972, Van Moer won three Golden Shoes and equalled Van Himst's fourth rank at the Ballon d'Or in 1980.|$|E
5000|$|Pope Francis {{visited the}} Great Synagogue on 17 January, 2016. During his visit, the pope denounced all {{violence}} {{committed in the}} name of God, and joined in the diaspora as a sign of interfaith friendship. Pope Francis repeated several times the words first spoken by Pope John <b>Paul,</b> <b>saying</b> that Jews were the [...] "elder brothers" [...] of Christians. Pope Francis added Christian [...] "elder sisters" [...] of the Jewish faith to his words.|$|R
6000|$|But {{some one}} will say--"Die?--of course we shall all die--good and bad alike." [...] Is it so, my friends? Then why does our Lord say, [...] "He that liveth and believeth in me shall never die?" [...] And why does St. <b>Paul</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "If ye through the spirit do mortify," [...] that is crush, {{and as it}} were kill, [...] "the deeds of the body," [...] all those low animal passions and vices, [...] "ye shall live." ...|$|R
6000|$|For one moment, Gabriel saw {{his father}} {{trembling}} violently from head to foot--then his limbs steadied again--stiffened suddenly, as if struck by catalepsy. His lips parted, but without quivering; his eyes glared, but without moving in the orbits. The lovely moonlight itself looked ghastly and horrible, shining on the supernatural panic deformity of that face! Gabriel turned away his head in terror. He heard the voice of Father <b>Paul</b> <b>saying</b> to him: [...] "Wait here till I come back." ...|$|R
500|$|Paul {{built the}} members a cabana style house on his pool deck with air conditioning, a TV, and beds so the members felt {{comfortable}} while recording. Paul produced {{the record and}} Gray felt Paul [...] "facilitated the whole thing". The album was completed in roughly a month, with three recording sessions. The band worked on the record for eight days and returned home for a break. A 14-day session, followed the break and then another 10 days in the studio. Gray asserts the breaks in between recording sessions were to [...] "re charge the batteries", and [...] "get a fresh head". As the line-up was complete, the band started to brainstorm names. When a member thought of a name they would write it {{on a piece of}} paper and put it in an amp box outside the studio. Someone wrote [...] "Hellyeah", and the band thought it was a perfect choice. <b>Paul</b> <b>says</b> it's [...] "very affirmative and full of attitude. When your buddy asks if you want to get a beer tonight, you don't just say 'yes,' you say, [...] "Hell yeah!". Gray attributes the name to [...] "late teens, keggers and chicks and AC/DC and Metallica".|$|E
500|$|Paul's sixteenth CD, The Day After Everything Changed, was {{released}} on January 12, 2010. Rather than work with a record label, Paul invited fans to help finance the recording by offering donors various premiums determined by the level of donation. [...] Although Paul wasn't sure {{what to expect when}} the United States economy collapsed, the fan-funding initiative resulted in more than $100,000 being collected - more, according to Paul, - than any label had ever spent on him. Recorded in Nashville with a guest appearance by Kristian Bush that includes a duet on the track, [...] "Paper Dolls", <b>Paul</b> <b>says</b> the fan support inspired him to make [...] "the best record I could". One reviewer wrote: [...] "This is such a tuneful, beautifully drawn set of songs played and sung with authority that it reminds you how much we need storytellers back in pop music—storytellers with empathy, fine eyes and an understanding that even though we live in a soulless, indifferent world our music doesn't have to reflect our culture." [...] In her review for the Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz said that the CD is [...] "a masterwork filled with the best music and lyrics of his career." ...|$|E
