25|$|Ordinary, {{untreated}} eyeglasses {{give some}} protection.

2500|$|The {{first batch}} of PlayStations used a KSM-440AAM laser unit whose case and all movable parts were {{completely}} {{made out of}} plastic. Over time, friction causes the <b>plastic</b> <b>lens</b> sled rail to wear out—usually unevenly. The placement of the laser unit close to the power supply accelerated wear because of the additional heat, which makes the plastic even more vulnerable to friction. Eventually, {{one side of the}} lens sled can become so worn that the laser can tilt, no longer pointing directly at the CD. [...] This would cause data read errors and games would no longer load. [...] One common fix is to turn the PlayStation upside down, making the lens sled rest on the unworn top rails. [...] Sony eventually fixed the problem by making the sled out of die-cast metal and placing the laser unit slightly farther away from the power supply on later models of the PlayStation.|$|E

40|$|Although produceable at low costs, <b>plastic</b> <b>lenses</b> are {{not used}} in {{precision}} optics unitl now, because of following reasons: - they are sensitive to mechanical influences (scratches [...] .) - there is no possibility to deposit optical coatings.

50|$|<b>Plastic</b> <b>lenses</b> are {{currently}} {{the most commonly}} prescribed lens, owing to their relative safety, low cost, ease of production, and high optical quality. The main drawbacks of many types of <b>plastic</b> <b>lenses</b> are the ease by which a lens can be scratched, and the limitations and costs of producing higher-index lenses. CR-39 lenses are an exception in that they have inherent scratch resistance.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two types}} of LEDs: colored LEDs and white LEDs. Colored LEDs emit a {{specific}} color light (monochromatic light), regardless of the color of the transparent <b>plastic</b> <b>lens</b> that encases the LED's chip.

In 1936, optometrist William Feinbloom introduced <b>plastic</b> in <b>lenses,</b> making them lighter and more convenient. These lenses were a combination of glass and plastic.
