Johnson says the PPACA [...] "will lead to rationed care, lower the quality of care, increase medical costs and severely limit medical innovation… this law will add trillions of dollars to our nation’s debt and deficit".

The current <b>suspend</b> <b>implementations</b> writes the entire memory space to disk at the moment-of-suspend. However, {{a large portion of}} this memory is rarely modified over time and therefore could be written early. We present a novel system to improve the performance of suspend operations. We utilize a generational garbage collector to hint where old data exists in a process’s virtual address space and then write that memory to disk early. Then, at the moment-of-suspend, only the remaining portion of memory is written to disk. Our preliminary evaluation improves suspend performance directly proportional to the amount of old data that is written early, in the best case. 1...|$|R
5000|$|When the new {{constitution}} was drafted lessons had been learned from the Free State constitution. It too granted the Oireachtas a temporary power to make constitutional amendments by ordinary law, but, unlike the Free State constitution, it expressly forbade the legislature from using this power to extend the transitional period. Article 46 of the {{new constitution}} required that constitutional amendments be approved by referendum while Article 51 of the Transitory <b>Provisions</b> <b>suspended</b> this requirement for an initial three years (beginning when the first president assumed office). However Article 46 forbade the legislature from amending either itself or Article 51. In the event the Oireachtas used its transitional power only twice, when it adopted the First Amendment and the Second Amendment. The new constitution then settled down and was not amended again for thirty years. Another difference from the Free State constitution is that the modern constitution requires constitutional amendments to be expressly identified as such. Every amendment must have the long title [...] "An Act to amend the Constitution".|$|R

50|$|President Clinton {{attended}} {{the funeral of}} assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in Jerusalem in November 1995. Following a March 1996 visit to Israel, President Clinton offered $100 million in aid for Israel's anti-terror activities, another $200 million for Arrow anti-missile deployment, and about $50 million for an anti-missile laser weapon. President Clinton disagreed with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policy of expanding Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, and {{it was reported that}} the President believed that the Prime Minister delayed the peace process. President Clinton hosted negotiations at the Wye River Conference Center in Maryland, ending with the signing of an agreement on 23 October 1998. Israel <b>suspended</b> <b>implementation</b> of the Wye agreement in early December 1998, when the Palestinians violated the Wye Agreement by threatening to declare a state (Palestinian statehood was not mentioned in Wye). In January 1999, the Wye Agreement was delayed until the Israeli elections in May.|$|R
50|$|On October 7, 2014, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals {{reversed}} {{the decision of}} the federal district court in Nevada and remanded it back to the district court, ordering it to immediately issue an injunction to bar enforcement of the Nevada same sex marriage ban amendment. It immediately made its holdings final and issued its mandate. On October 8, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, apparently by mistake, ordered the Ninth Circuit's mandate temporarily stayed as part of his response to a request from Idaho officials in a related case. He amended his order to exempt this case from that stay. The same day, the Coalition for the Protection of Marriage asked the U.S. Supreme Court to <b>suspend</b> <b>implementation</b> of its ruling, referencing the arguments made by Idaho state officials in Sevcik. It withdrew that request the next day and then renewed it on October 13.|$|R

5|$|The {{government}} of Malaysia in 2007 outlawed {{usage of the}} term Allah in any other but Muslim contexts, but the Malayan High Court in 2009 revoked the law, ruling that it was unconstitutional. While Allah had been used for the Christian God in Malay {{for more than four}} centuries, the contemporary controversy was triggered by usage of Allah by the Roman Catholic newspaper The Herald. The government appealed the court ruling, and the High Court <b>suspended</b> <b>implementation</b> of its verdict until the appeal was heard. In October 2013, the court ruled in favor of the government's ban. In early 2014, the Malaysian government confiscated more than 300 bibles for using the word to refer to the Christian God in Peninsular Malaysia. However, the use of Allah is not prohibited in the two Malaysian state of Sabah and Sarawak. The main reason it is not prohibited in these two states is that usage has been long-established and local Alkitab (Bibles) have been widely distributed freely in East Malaysia without restrictions for years. Both states also do not have similar Islamic state laws as those in West Malaysia.|$|R
