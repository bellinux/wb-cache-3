5|$|The Spotted Saddle Horse is a horse breed {{from the}} United States that was {{developed}} by crossing Spanish-American type gaited pinto ponies with gaited horse breeds, such as the Tennessee Walking Horse. The result was a colorful, smooth-gaited horse, used in the show ring and for pleasure and trail riding. Two registries have been created for the breed, one in 1979 {{and the other in}} 1985. The two have similar registration requirements, although one has an open stud book and the other is slightly more strict with regard to parentage requirements, having a semi-closed stud book. The Spotted Saddle Horse is a light riding horse, always pinto in color. Solid-colored foals from registered <b>parents</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> registered for identification purposes, so their pinto-colored foals have documented parentage. They always perform an ambling gait, rather than a trot, in addition to the gaits of walk and canter, performed by all breeds.|$|E

25|$|Some {{types of}} {{albinism}} affect only {{the skin and}} hair, while other types affect the skin, hair and eyes, and in rare cases only the eyes.

25|$|Some {{parents want}} to try to have a baby very soon after the miscarriage. The {{decision}} of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult. Reasons exist that may prompt parents to consider another pregnancy. For older mothers, there may be some sense of urgency. Other parents are optimistic that future pregnancies are likely to be successful. Many are hesitant and {{want to know about the}} risk of having another or more miscarriages. Some clinicians recommend that the women have one menstrual cycle before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception may be hard to determine. Also, the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected. <b>Parents</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage, molar pregnancy or are undergoing tests.

25|$|An {{interesting}} {{aspect of}} cultural capital that sometimes {{comes into play}} in immigrant families is familiarity with American laws. Parents may find that U.S. law is in conflict with their traditional means of disciplining their children. While <b>parents</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> accustomed to certain parental rights in their home country, these rights may not be protected in American society. There may be cases in which outside agents—either school officials, police officers, or government officials—become involved in conflicts between parents and children. This is particularly true in cases of alleged physical abuse. Children, who may be more familiar with American laws, can use this knowledge to gain assistance from individuals outside of the family. The involvement of outside agents may tip the traditional power balance within the family and affords family members who are {{more familiar with the}} rules and norms of the United States a certain degree of power over family members who are not as familiar with these laws. Among immigrants who come from cultures with strict hierarchies based on age, such interventions can be devastating to parents who may feel that their authority has been undermined. Family members who are better assimilated into American culture are more able, and probably more likely, to utilize their knowledge of American laws to change the dynamics of family relations. This generates inequality based on degree of assimilation since those who are less assimilated are more likely to lose face {{as the result of the}} penetration of such laws into the traditionally private domain of the family.|$|E

2500|$|The word '' means 'substitute'. It is coded in the DSM-IV under Factitious Disorder NOS (not {{otherwise}} specified). Münchausen {{by proxy}} is the involuntary use of another individual {{to play the}} patient role. For example, false symptoms are produced [...] in children by the caregivers or parents, to produce the appearance of [...] illness, or they may give misleading medical histories about their children. The parent may falsify the child's medical history or tamper with laboratory tests to make the child appear sick. Occasionally, in Münchausen by proxy, the caregiver actually injures the child or makes it sick {{to ensure that the}} child is treated.

2500|$|Today's {{military}} brat faces {{some additional}} challenges. For example, {{it is estimated}} that approximately 50,000 military families have both parents serving in the armed forces; this creates the possibility that both <b>parents</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> deployed at the same time. Another significant difference is the speed of communication. With the advent of the Internet it is possible for family members to communicate with servicemen in combat zones. This allows brats to remain in closer contact with their military parent(s), but it also increases tension as more details reach the military families. Round-the-clock news agencies, such as CNN and Fox News, spread news faster than the military bureaucracy can process the details. This means that military families know that servicemen have died before official word reaches the family. Military psychiatrist Colonel Stephen Cozza says that a [...] "sense of fear" [...] accompanies news of the death of a service member until confirmation that the service member was not a loved one.|$|E
