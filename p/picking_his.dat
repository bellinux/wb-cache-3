25|$|Even so, Velázquez's {{power within}} the PRI slipped in the 1990s as his own health declined. While in the past every President of Mexico {{consulted}} Velázquez before <b>picking</b> <b>his</b> successor, Velázquez was not consulted {{in the selection of}} Luis Donaldo Colosio as the PRI's presidential candidate in 1994. Even after Colosio's assassination Velázquez was only told that Ernesto Zedillo was the new Presidential candidate a few minutes before the formal announcement.|$|E
25|$|One {{race was}} left in the season. A week after the San Antonio, Seabiscuit and Kayak II both took the gate for the Santa Anita Handicap and its $121,000 prize. 78,000 paying spectators crammed the racetrack, most backing Seabiscuit. Pollard found his horse blocked almost from the start. <b>Picking</b> <b>his</b> way through the field, Seabiscuit briefly led. As they thundered down the back straight, Seabiscuit became trapped in third place, behind leader Whichcee and Wedding Call on the outside.|$|E
25|$|Bedser {{served as}} a {{national}} team selector from 1962 to 1985, and was chairman of selectors from 1968 to 1981. He was {{on the board of}} selectors who controversially left Basil d'Oliveira out of the England team for 1968's tour of South Africa. England won ten of the 18 series while Bedser was chairman of selectors. Bedser also managed two England overseas tours. Bedser was made president of Surrey in 1987 in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the county's cricketing fortunes over the previous five decades. He was knighted for his services to cricket in the 1997 New Year Honours. In October 2004 Bedser was selected in 'England's Greatest Post-War XI' by The Wisden Cricketer, an authoritative monthly cricket magazine. In May 2009, Christopher Martin-Jenkins ranked Bedser 29th in <b>picking</b> <b>his</b> 100 greatest cricketers of all time.|$|E

25|$|Unwilling {{to accept}} that Oogway's {{decision}} was intentional, Shifu tries {{to get rid of}} Po through a torturous and agonizing training regime. The Furious Five also scorn and disparage Po as an upstart with no skill or potential in kung fu. However, after receiving encouragement from Oogway, Po endures his training and slowly begins to befriend the Five with his tenacity, culinary skill, and good humor. Meanwhile, Tai Lung escapes from prison as foreseen by Oogway, ironically <b>picking</b> <b>his</b> locks with one of Zeng's fallen feathers. Shifu learns of Tai Lung's escape from Zeng and informs Oogway, who extracts a promise from Shifu to believe in Po, and then passes on to the heavens in a stream of peach blossoms. Still unable to grasp the basics of kung fu, Po despairingly admits that he has no chance of defeating Tai Lung. Shifu, however, discovers that Po is capable of impressive physical feats when motivated by food. Using this as positive reinforcement, Shifu successfully trains Po to incorporate these feats into an effective kung fu style.|$|E
25|$|Diaz {{was signed}} to a two-fight {{deal with the}} PRIDE Fighting Championships with the first {{scheduled}} to be against Lightweight Champion Takanori Gomi in a non-title fight on February 24 in Las Vegas. PRIDE 33 was Diaz's first fight in the PRIDE organization and at the weight of 160lb. While Gomi started the fight strong, once knocking Diaz to the ground, and twice ending up in his guard, the Californian dominated the standup battle with his boxing style, <b>picking</b> <b>his</b> opponent apart with quick and accurate jabs and looping punches. At {{the end of the}} first round, apparently due to poor cardio on Gomi's part, the Japanese fighter was clearly stunned, throwing much wilder punches and barely maintaining his defense. At one point though, the fight was stopped to check a cut suffered under Diaz' eye. The second stanza saw a continuation of wild punches by Gomi, then eventually taking the fight to the ground and leaving himself open to a Gogoplata submission by Diaz and tapping at 1:46 of the round. This was the second successful Gogoplata attempt in PRIDE's history (the first performed by future DREAM Lightweight Champion Shinya Aoki on Joachim Hansen less than two months earlier at PRIDE's New Year's event).|$|E
500|$|Falstaff and his servants, Bardolfo and Pistola, are {{drinking}} at the inn. Dr Caius bursts in and accuses Falstaff of burgling {{his house and}} Bardolfo of <b>picking</b> <b>his</b> pocket. He is ejected. Falstaff hands a letter to each of his servants for delivery to Alice Ford and Meg Page, two wealthy married women. In these two identical letters, Falstaff professes his love {{for each of the}} women, although it is access to their husbands' money that he chiefly covets. Bardolfo and Pistola refuse, claiming that honour prevents them from obeying him. Falstaff dispatches his page, Robin, to deliver the letters. Falstaff delivers a tirade at his rebellious followers (L'onore! Ladri... ! [...] / [...] "Honour! You rogues... !") telling them that honour is a mere word and is of no practical value. He chases them out of his sight.|$|E

2500|$|According to Wilferd Madelung, during Uthman’s reign, “grievances {{against his}} {{arbitrary}} acts were substantial by standards of his time. Historical sources mention a lengthy {{account of the}} wrongdoings he was accused of... It was only his violent death that came to absolve him in Sunni ideology from any ahdath and make him a martyr and the third Rightly Guided Caliph.” [...] According to Keaney Heather, Uthman, as a caliph, relied solely on his own volition in <b>picking</b> <b>his</b> cabinet, which led to decisions that bred resistance within the Muslim community. Indeed, his style of governance made Uthman {{one of the most}} controversial figures in Islamic history.|$|E

[...] After several weeks on the road, they reached Boston, by which time Bankhead was ready to dismiss him.

Bankhead had recommended him to Williams for the role of Stanley, thinking he was perfect for the part.|$|E
