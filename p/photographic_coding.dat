Clement, Jr. Advancements in technology, architecture, landscape, {{planning}} and design, and education are being pursued in the 21 st century. Unfortunately, the campuses {{of higher education}} institutions, which promote such advancements, {{do not reflect the}} vision of innovation and creativity. Rather, the exterior environments on college campuses portray a 19 th century gardenesque landscape aesthetic, which emphasizes a “park-like” appearance and discounts ecological functions. The Kansas State University campus evidences a gardenesque aesthetic that arguably is not performing socially or ecologically to its fullest potential. This Master’s Project and Report uses an open space on K-State’s campus, Coffman Commons, to challenge its aesthetic performance. Campus landscape aesthetic performance can be improved by designing a community amenity that celebrates ecological processes, especially regarding stormwater, and involves the campus community in the design process. A conceptual framework, rooted in the Vitruvian Triad, directs the project’s methodology. Methods of photojournalism and design are conducted. Photojournalism is used to collect aesthetic responses of Coffman Commons from K-State students, faculty, and staff. Their photographic and textual responses inform the design process. The photography method allows each participant to confer importance to aspects of the landscape that moved them. Through <b>photographic</b> <b>coding</b> and content analysis, commonalities are discovered in the landscape with which each person identifies. The participants’ written descriptions further inform an understanding of expectations and hopes for Coffman Commons. Influenced by the photographic research and guided by set goals and objectives, the design method allows the innovation of a contextually specific and personable design solution for Coffman Commons. The design exhibits two community amenities which invite social activity to Coffman Commons. The amenities incorporate visible water systems (rain gardens and dry swales) - increasing the ecological performance of the Commons, and provide research opportunities for piezoelectric technology. The design also features inscriptions which honor Dr. Coffman and K-State Distinguished Faculty. This Master’s Project and Report transforms a gardensque campus landscape into a high-performance landscape that responsibly manages stormwater and enriches user experience...|$|E

40|$|The study {{deals with}} the {{experience}} of displacement. It treats the subject through the <b>photographic</b> <b>codes</b> of Chukchi migrants and tourists who have one way or another transcended rather notional boundaries of cultural configurations. Methodologically, the study combines visual anthropology, phenomenology of body and space, and surrealist approach to reality. Visuality is not seen as a mere tool of anthropological knowledge but a disposition for new epistemology. The study reveals the interrelation between the transformation of Chukchi from tourists to migrants while gradually integrating themselves in a culturally new milieu of Saint Petersburg, and their way of seeing. It is then also the character of their snapshots which changes: photography of remarkable is replaced by the photography of observed and later on by the photography of an observer...|$|R
40|$|My thesis {{examines}} the nexus between secrecy, death, photography and the psychoanalytic dynamic of projective identification, {{which is an}} unconscious psychoanalytic interaction which translates and potentially transforms rejected or denied experiences. The visual codes of secrecy, evident through the content and form of photographic images, exist as a nuanced means of social communication. I write about how social secrecy regarding death translates into the visual image. I have isolated social issues of taboos around {{the representation of the}} dead in contemporary western culture to explore the dynamics of cultural secrecy. My argument is that photography is the most appropriate form of artistic visual expression because of its links to truthfulness and revelation. It allows a fresh perspective on secrecy through the analysis of images from the difficult genre of postmortem photographs by artists such as Jeffrey Silverthorne, Sue Fox and Andre Serrano. The thesis exposes the concealment/revelation paradox indexical of secrecy. I focus in particular on the photographic treatment of the dead body by artists Sebastio Salgado and Joel Peter Witkin, referencing their work in relation to projective identification. Some of the images of the corpse in my thesis are disturbing and confronting - my argument identifies some of the reasons this is so. This study breaks apart collusive patterns of thinking which adhere around the <b>photographic</b> <b>codes</b> of secrecy...|$|R
50|$|The Kroger {{house was}} full of spying equipment, {{including}} large sums of money, <b>photographic</b> material, <b>code</b> pads for coding messages and a long-range radio transmitter-receiver for communicating with Moscow. It took several days to unearth all the equipment, and other items including fake passports were not found until after the police had left. The MI5 intelligence officer Peter Wright has stated that the Krogers' radio transmitter was only located after nine days of searching. Over the years, during subsequent renovations several other radio transmitters were unearthed. Large amounts of money were {{also found in the}} homes of Houghton, Gee and Lonsdale.|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to situate}} Andy Warhol's {{work from the}} 1960 s in its cultural, {{material}} and critical context. The first chapter follows Hal Foster's influential "traumatic realist" interpretation of Warhol to identify its strengths and limits. Foster's engagement with both the cultural theory of trauma and aspects {{of the work of}} Roland Barthes and Jacques Lacan are considered. In light of this assessment a case is made for the cultural studies approach to Warhol's work advocated by Douglas Crimp. The second chapter explores how Warhol's manipulation of images from Life 's archive engages the artist's work in a public discourse [...] structured by the <b>photographic</b> <b>codes</b> of the illustrated press [...] on the issues of his day. In the framework of Allan Sekula's "archival paradigm" a measure of political agency for Warhol {{in the context of a}} public visual domain emerges. This understanding of Warhol's intervention is supported by Barthes's analyses of signifying practices in the cultural sphere and Walter Benjamin's description of the reproductive imaging technologies, on which such practices depend. The third chapter focuses on the philosophical status of Warhol's work, as discussed by Arthur Danto and his critics. Warhol's artistic description seems to issue a prescription as well, to intervene in the public sphere by means of its own communicative resources. The political stakes of this prescriptive aspect of Warhol's work are examined in the context of the artist's involvement in the gay underworld of the 1960 s and its representation in the popular pres...|$|R
40|$|The Years of the North Atlantic Humpback (YoNAH) project {{collected}} {{photographs of}} flukes of humpback whales to identify individuals for estimating abundance using capture-recapture techniques. Data were {{collected during the}} winter breeding and summer feeding seasons in 1992 and 1993. Smith et al. (in prep) identified possible violations {{in three of the}} assumptions needed for unbiased abundance estimators: closed population, equal probabilities of capture, and the identification of marks. ^ To evaluate the assumption that all animals were recognized when photographed again, methods for <b>coding</b> <b>photographic</b> quality and the distinctiveness of whales were developed and applied to the YoNAH photographic database. Analytical methods were then developed to evaluate the effects of photographic quality and whale distinctiveness on the abundance estimates produced from this database. To evaluate the assumptions of a closed population and equal probabilities of capture, a model of the probability of sampling individual humpback whales was developed. ^ The error rate of the <b>photographic</b> quality <b>coding</b> process for the YoNAH database was found to be a function {{of the quality of the}} photographs, such that poor quality photographs were less likely to change code on a second coding. Poor quality photographs were found to cause a potential positive bias in the abundance estimates. Analyses indicated that removing photographs of the lowest quality level and images of partial and right or left half flukes provided the optimum balance between precision and bias. ^ The coding of whale distinctiveness independently of photographic quality proved difficult for some coders. The distinctiveness of whales represented by at least one high quality photograph did not significantly affect their recapture rate. ^ Simulations of the YoNAH sampling project indicated that estimators that compared data collected during a breeding season to data collect during a feeding season within the same year were more robust than other estimators to violations of the equal probability of capture assumption and the closed population assumption. However, variability in the individual probability of sampling significantly affected all estimators. Areas where additional data are needed to measure the bias in these abundance estimates are identified. ...|$|R
5000|$|The 25th's 654th Squadron {{conducted}} night <b>photographic</b> reconnaissance missions (<b>code</b> named Joker) {{to detect}} German operations being conducted {{under the cover}} of darkness as well as daytime and mapping missions over Occupied Europe using a variety of aircraft. Some missions were conducted to provide target imagery for H2X radars to be used on later strikes. [...] The group also performed post-strike visual reconnaissance and prestrike electronic warfare, distributing chaff ahead of attacking formations. Experiments had shown that Mosquitoes equipped with an electric dispensing system in their bomb bays provided the optimum coverage of chaff and three of the group's aircraft were specially equipped for this mission. [...] The squadron also had two Martin B-26 Marauders assigned for special operations with the Office of Strategic Services.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{recording}} of color still images into magneto–optical video disks has been increasingly {{used as a}} method for recording electronic endoscopic images. In this case, image compression {{is often used to}} reduce the volume and cost of recording media and also to minimize the time required for image recording and playback. With this in mind, we recorded 8 images into a magneto-optical video disk in 4 image compression modes (no compression, weak compression, moderate compression, and strong compression) using the Joint <b>Photographic</b> Image <b>Coding</b> Experts Group (JPEG) system, which is a widely used and representative method for compressing color still images, {{in order to determine the}} relationship between the degree of image compression and the color information in electronic endoscopic images. The acquired images were transferred to an image processor using an offline system. A total of 10 regions of interest (ROls) were selected, and red (R), green (G), and blue (B) images were obtained using different compression modes. From histograms generated for these images, mean densities of R, G, and B in each ROI were measured and analyzed. The results revealed that color changes were greater for B, which had the lowest density, than for R or G as the degree of compression was increased...|$|R
40|$|This studio-centred {{doctoral}} project {{questions the}} logic of photography as both natural and authentic based upon its ontology as the material trace of light. Where {{the logic of}} photography supports its prevailing identification as the language of light, certainty and realism, I discover the medium to have a paradoxical foundation in darkness, mystery, and melancholy. I establish evidence for this at photography’s nascence in the two ‘first’ photographs by inventors Nicéphore Niépce (Point de Vue du Gras, 1827) and William Henry Fox Talbot (Latticed Window, 1835). I produce new artworks – Wail (2007); Grail (2008), and Black Sun (2009) – inspired by my close reading of these photographs and my renovated account of their themes. In Niépce’s heliograph, I find evidence for photography’s foundation in heliolatry. I compare the photograph {{to a variety of}} heliolatric objects based in the sun’s insecurity rather than its fidelity. I discuss Niépce’s heliograph as an object of reflection, projection and ritual function. I trace the relationship between photography and the black sun of alchemy. I note the prevalence of melancholia amongst the inventors of photography and explore Julia Kristeva’s use of the black sun as a metaphor to describe depression. I compare the raw trace of photography with that of the pre-symbolic psyche to argue that both must first be understood as language in order to be meaningful. Meaning arrives in the photograph like light from a distant star: a projection of desire by the viewing subject, justified retrospectively in the logic of the ‘real’. It is by this same process that we recognise the moment indicated by photography as a lost one, based upon the perceived distance of a photograph from its referent. Against photography’s identity as a medium of instantaneity, precision, stability and clarity, I argue that photography has a powerful capacity to encode multiple, latent, concealed and occult meanings. I consider Talbot’s Latticed Window photograph exemplary of this potential and propose multiple possibilities for its motivation. I note Talbot’s polymathic interests in languages and secret codes. I discover occult emblems of Freemasonry in many of Talbot’s photographs and suggest his Latticed Window can be read as illustrative of Masonic beliefs and rituals. My aim is not to supplant existing readings of Talbot’s photographs but to draw attention to these supplements and the capacity of the <b>photographic</b> <b>code</b> to conceal and reveal even as it persistently defies closure. I note than through its ease of reproduction, photography presents new opportunities to confer meaning on previously unrelated artworks. I present a picture essay juxtaposing photographs by Talbot and artworks by Marcel Duchamp to highlight the intriguing occult visual language that they share. I contend that photography has an affinity with mystery. I speculate that photography’s hidden ontology in darkness, mystery and melancholy fuels the medium’s enormous psychic power like a black sun. Out of darkness, photography gives light to the losses and limitations of knowledge, the transitory experience of awareness, and the contingencies of self-hood in an illusory experience of the ‘real’.
