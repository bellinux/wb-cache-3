25|$|In semibullvalene (C8H8), one {{ethylene}} arm {{is replaced}} by a single bond. The compound was first prepared by photolysis of barrelene in isopentane with acetone as a <b>photosensitizer</b> in 1966.|$|E
25|$|Methylene blue {{is also a}} <b>photosensitizer</b> used {{to create}} singlet oxygen when exposed to both oxygen and light. It is used in this regard to make organic {{peroxides}} by a Diels-Alder reaction which is spin forbidden with normal atmospheric triplet oxygen.|$|E
25|$|The {{generation}} of CIDNP {{in a typical}} photochemical system (target + <b>photosensitizer,</b> flavin in this example) is a cyclic photochemical process shown schematically in Figure 1. The chain of reactions is initiated by a blue light photon, which excites the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) <b>photosensitizer</b> to the singlet excited state. The fluorescence quantum yield of this state is rather low, and {{approximately half of the}} molecules undergo intersystem crossing into the long-lived triplet state. Triplet FMN has a remarkable electron affinity. If a molecule with a low ionization potential (e.g. phenols, polyaromatics) is present in the system, the diffusion-limited electron transfer reaction forms a spin-correlated triplet electron transfer state – a radical pair. The actual kinetics are rather complicated and may involve multiple (de)protonations and hence exhibit pH dependence.|$|E

We found that nanoscale <b>photosensitizers</b> were more efficient in HepG 2 cell inhibition compared with conventional <b>photosensitizers.</b> In addition, levels of activated caspase- 3 and caspase- 9 were significantly higher in cells treated with Photosan-II loaded in nanoparticles than free Photosan-II. Finally, treatment with nanoscale <b>photosensitizers</b> increased mouse survival and reduced tumor volume in mice {{to a greater extent}} compared with free <b>photosensitizers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Fluorescence spectra and {{fluorescence}} lifetime images of talaporfin sodium and sodium-pheophorbide a, {{which can be}} regarded as <b>photosensitizers</b> for photodynamic therapy, were measured in normal and cancer cells. The reduction of the fluorescence intensity by photoirradiation was observed for both <b>photosensitizers</b> in both cells, but the quenching rate was much faster in cancer cells than in normal cells. These results are explained in terms of the excessive generation of reactive oxygen species via photoexcitation of these <b>photosensitizers</b> in cancer cells. The {{fluorescence lifetime}}s of both <b>photosensitizers</b> in cancer cells are different from those in normal cells, which originates from the different intracellular environments around the <b>photosensitizers</b> between normal and cancer cells...|$|R
30|$|To {{respond to}} the light, <b>photosensitizers</b> have to be {{incorporated}} into the liposomes to trigger the release. Although there are a wide range of <b>photosensitizers</b> to choose including photosensitive lipids/surfactants, photosensitive molecular dyes, or photosensitive nanoparticles, the following criteria should be met: (1) the incorporation of <b>photosensitizers</b> does not disturb the physical and chemical properties of the liposomes; (2) under the stimulus, the <b>photosensitizers</b> disrupt the liposomes effectively and efficiently; and (3) the stimulus has minimal damage to the tissue and organ.|$|R
25|$|While past cancer {{research}} has involved radiation therapy, photodynamic therapy {{is important to}} study because breakthroughs in treatments for tumor cells will give more options to patients with different conditions. Recent experiments using HeLa cells in {{cancer research}} involves {{the development of new}} photosensitizers with increased ability to be absorbed by cancer cells and still trigger cell death. It is also important that a new <b>photosensitizer</b> does not stay in the body {{for a long time to}} prevent unwanted cell damage.|$|E
25|$|Chlorophyll {{itself is}} bound to {{proteins}} and can transfer the absorbed energy in the required direction. Protochlorophyllide, however, occurs mostly in the free form and, under light conditions, acts as a <b>photosensitizer,</b> forming highly toxic free radicals. Hence, plants need an efficient mechanism of regulating the amount of chlorophyll precursor. In angiosperms, this is done at the step of δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), one of the intermediate compounds in the biosynthetic pathway. Plants that are fed by ALA accumulate high and toxic levels of protochlorophyllide, as do mutants with a disrupted regulatory system.|$|E

40|$|The present work is {{focussed}} on {{the principles}} of photodynamic therapy (PDT), emphasizing the photochemical mecha-nisms of reactive oxygen species formation and the consequent biochemical processes generated by the action of reactive oxygen species on various biological macromolecules and organelles. This paper also presents some of the most used <b>photosensitizers,</b> including Photofrin, and the new prototypes of <b>photosensitizers,</b> analysing their physicochemical and spectroscopic properties. At this point, the review discusses the therapeutic window of absorption of specific wavelengths involving first- and second-generation <b>photosensitizers,</b> as well as the principal light sources used in PDT. Additionally, the aggregation process, which consists in a phenomenon common to several <b>photosensitizers,</b> is studied. J-aggregates and H-aggregates are discussed, along with their spectroscopic effects. Most <b>photosensitizers</b> have a significant hydro-phobic character; thus, the study of the types of aggregation in aqueous solvent is very relevant. Important aspects of the coordination chemistry of metalloporphyrins and metallophthalocyanines used as <b>photosensitizers</b> are also discussed. The state-of-the-art in PDT is evaluated, discussing recent articles in this area. Furthermore, macrocyclic <b>photosensitizers,</b> such as porphyrins and phthalocyanines, are specifically described. The present review is an important contribution, because PDT {{is one of the most}} auspicious advances in the therapy against cancer and other non-malignant diseases...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of <b>photosensitizers</b> on lipid peroxidation in the retina was investigated. Porcine retinal {{homogenate}} was exposed to illumination from a fluorescent lamp with or without <b>photosensitizers</b> such as hematoporphyrin, rose bengal, and fluorescein for 60 min. The control, which was exposed to illumination without <b>photosensitizers,</b> did not show {{a significant increase in}} lipid peroxidation. However, lipid peroxidation in the homogenates exposed to illumination with <b>photosensitizers</b> increased significantly and in a dose-dependent manner. For concentrations of more than 100 μM of all three <b>photosensitizers,</b> lipid peroxidation in the retina homogenates increased to a level approximately 2 - 3 times higher than that in the sample before illumination, and to a level 10 times higher than that of the control. α-Tocopherol inhibited hematoporphyrin-induced lipid peroxidation in a dose-dependent manner, but superoxide dismutase did not show an inhibitory effect...|$|R

40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) {{has already}} been a {{multifunctional}} modality for various tumors and nontumorous diseases. However, the development of <b>photosensitizers</b> is relatively delayed, compared with the tremendous progress in laser technology. Elsinochrome A (EA), a perylenequinonoid pigment from China, has all the typical advantages of perylenequinones. Moreover, singlet oxygen quantum yield of EA is superior to other kinds of <b>photosensitizers</b> and EA could be artificially biosynthesized at present, which make it an alternative candidate for PDT. In this review, the photophysics, photochemistry, photobiology and chemical or biological syntheses of EA <b>photosensitizers</b> are briefly presented.

40|$|SummaryPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) is {{emerging}} as a potential therapeutic modality in the clinical management of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). In order to establish a rationale for effective PDT of CL, we investigated {{the impact of the}} molecular charge and structure of <b>photosensitizers</b> on the parasitic phototoxic response. Two <b>photosensitizers</b> from the benzophenoxazine family that bear an overall cationic charge and two anionic porphyrinoid molecules were evaluated. The photodynamic activity of the <b>photosensitizers</b> decreases in the following order: EtNBSe > EtNBS > BpD > PpIX. The studies suggest that compared to hydrophobic anionic <b>photosensitizers,</b> the hydrophilic cationic benzophenoxazine analogs provide high effectiveness of PDT possibly due to (1) their strong attraction to the negatively charged parasitic membrane, (2) their hydrophilicity, (3) their high singlet oxygen quantum yield, and (4) their efficacy in targeting intracellular organelles...|$|R

40|$|Photodynamic {{therapy is}} a {{well-established}} and clinically approved treatment for {{several types of}} cancer. Antineoplastic photodynamic therapy is based on <b>photosensitizers,</b> i. e., drugs that absorb photons translating light energy into a chemical potential that damages tumor tissues. Despite the encouraging clinical results with the approved <b>photosensitizers</b> available today, the prolonged skin phototoxicity, poor selectivity for diseased tissues, hydrophobic nature, and extended retention in the host organism shown by these drugs have stimulated researchers to develop new formulations for photodynamic therapy. In this context, due to their amphiphilic characteristic (compatibility with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic substances), liposomes {{have proven to be}} suitable carriers for <b>photosensitizers,</b> improving the photophysical properties of the <b>photosensitizers.</b> Moreover, as nanostructured drug delivery systems, liposomes improve the efficiency and safety of antineoplastic photodynamic therapy, mainly by the classical phenomenon of extended permeation and retention. Therefore, the association of <b>photosensitizers</b> with liposomes has been extensively studied. In this review, both current knowledge and future perspectives on liposomal carriers for antineoplastic photodynamic therapy are critically discussed...|$|R
50|$|The major {{difference}} between <b>photosensitizers</b> is {{the parts of the}} cell that they target.

40|$|Macrophages {{play key}} roles in {{inflammatory}} disorders. Therefore, they are targets of treatments aiming at their local destruction in inflammation sites. However, injection of low molecular mass therapeutics, including <b>photosensitizers,</b> in inflamed joints results in their rapid efflux {{out of the}} joints, and poor therapeutic index. To improve selective uptake and increase retention of therapeutics in inflamed tissues, hydrophilic nanogels based on chitosan, of which surface was decorated with hyaluronate and which were loaded with one of three different anionic <b>photosensitizers</b> were developed. Optimal uptake of these functionalized nanogels by murine RAW 264. 7 or human THP- 1 macrophages as models was achieved after < 4 h incubation, whereas only negligible uptake by murine fibroblasts used as control cells was observed. The uptake by cells and the intracellular localization of the <b>photosensitizers,</b> of the fluorescein-tagged chitosan and of the rhodamine-tagged hyaluronate were confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. Photodynamic experiments revealed good cell photocytotoxicity of the <b>photosensitizers</b> entrapped in the nanogels. In a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, injection of free <b>photosensitizers</b> resulted in their rapid clearance from the joints, while nanogel-encapsulated <b>photosensitizers</b> were retained in the inflamed joints {{over a longer period}} of time. The photodynamic treatment of the inflamed joints resulted in a reduction of inflammation comparable to a standard corticoid treatment. Thus, hyaluronate-chitosan nanogels encapsulating therapeutic agents are promising materials for the targeted delivery to macrophages and long-term retention of therapeutics in leaky inflamed articular joints...|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobial {{photodynamic}} therapy {{was shown to}} be effective against {{a wide range of}} bacterial cells, as well as for fungi, yeasts, and viruses. It was shown previously that photodestruction of yeast cells treated with <b>photosensitizers</b> resulted in cell destruction and leakage of ATP. Three <b>photosensitizers</b> were used in this study: tetra(N-methyl- 4 -pyridyl) porphine tetratosylate salt (TMPyP), toluidine blue O (TBO), and methylene blue trihydrate (MB). A microdilution method was used to determine MICs of the <b>photosensitizers</b> against both Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Listeria monocytogenes. To evaluate the effects of photodestruction on E. coli and L. monocytogenes cells, a bioluminescence method for detection of ATP leakage and a colony-forming assay were used. All tested <b>photosensitizers</b> were effective for photodynamic destruction of both bacteria. The effectiveness of <b>photosensitizers</b> (in microgram-per-milliliter equivalents) decreased in the order TBO > MB > TMPyP for both organisms. The MICs were two- to fourfold higher for E. coli O 157 :H 7 than for L. monocytogenes. The primary effects of all of the <b>photosensitizers</b> tested on live bacterial cells were a decrease in intracellular ATP and an increase in extracellular ATP, accompanied by elimination of viable cells from the sample. The time courses of photodestruction and intracellular ATP leakage were different for E. coli and L. monocytogenes.
