25|$|The Docklands' {{status as}} a symbol of Margaret Thatcher's Britain has also made it a target for terrorists. After a failed attempt to bomb Canary Wharf in 1992, a large IRA bomb {{exploded}} at South Quay on 9 February 1996. Two people died in the explosion, forty people were injured and an estimated £150 million of damage was caused. This bombing ended an IRA ceasefire. In a 1998 trial James McArdle was imprisoned for 25 years after a trial at Woolwich Crown Court that ended on 24 June.

25|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Bolte intended to proceed with the execution, a secret eleventh-hour plea for mercy was made by four of the jury members. They sent petitioning letters to the Governor of Victoria, Sir Rohan Delacombe, stating that in reaching their verdict they believed that capital punishment had been abolished in Victoria and requested that the governor exercise the Royal <b>Prerogative</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mercy</b> and commute Ryan's sentence of death. Such Melbourne newspapers as The Age, The Herald and The Sun all ran campaigns opposing the hanging of Ryan. The papers ran a campaign of spirited opposition {{on the grounds that the}} death penalty was barbaric. Churches, universities, unions and a large number of the public and legal professions opposed the death sentence. An estimated 18,000 people participated in street protests and around 15,000 signed a petition against the hanging. The Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) suspended radio broadcasts for two minutes as a protest.|$|E
25|$|A provincial {{government}} {{is defined by}} the Constitution Act, 1867, as the lieutenant governor acting on the advice of the executive council, what is technically known as the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, referring to the lieutenant governor as the Queen's stand-in. One of the main duties of the Crown in a province is to appoint the individual most likely to maintain the confidence of the legislative assembly as prime minister (known in the provinces as premier); this is usually the leader of the political party with a majority in the legislature, but when no party or coalition holds a majority (referred to as a minority parliament), or similar scenario, the lieutenant governor's judgement about the most suitable candidate for premier must be brought into play. The premier thereafter heads the executive council, which is made up of other ministers of the Crown who are similarly drawn from and responsible to the elected legislature and are charged with advising the lieutenant governor on how to exercise the Royal Prerogative, which includes the privilege to maintain the Queen's peace, grant immunity from prosecution, and invoke the <b>prerogative</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercy,</b> as well as to summon and prorogue parliament and call elections. In the construct of constitutional monarchy and responsible government, the ministerial advice tendered is typically binding; the monarch reigns but does not rule. However, {{it is important to note}} that, though it may often appear differently, the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown, not to any of the ministers, and the viceroyal figures may unilaterally use these powers in exceptional constitutional crisis situations.|$|E

500|$|Traditionally at common law, the {{prerogative}} of mercy– that is, {{the power of}} the executive government to pardon or to grant clemency to a convicted criminal– was regarded as outside the courts' supervisory jurisdiction and hence non-justiciable. This changed with the Divisional Court's decision in R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Bentley (1993), which held that the <b>prerogative</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercy</b> is reviewable in some circumstances. This case was considered by the Singapore Court of Appeal in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), Chief Justice Chan expressing the opinion that the case [...] "clearly decided that the <b>prerogative</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercy</b> would be reviewable if it were exercised based on an error of law (in that case, the Home Secretary’s misconstruction of the type of pardon which the Home Office could grant), or based on arbitrary and/or extraneous considerations", though courts still cannot review the merits of any clemency decision.|$|E

500|$|In late February 1968, {{considering}} {{the fate of}} James Dhlamini, Victor Mlambo and Duly Shadreck, three black Rhodesians convicted of murder and terrorist offences before UDI, Beadle ruled that Salisbury retained its pre-UDI powers regarding executions and could carry out death sentences. Whitehall announced on 1 March that {{at the request of}} the UK government, the Queen had exercised the royal <b>prerogative</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercy</b> and commuted the three death sentences to life imprisonment. Dhlamini and the others applied for a permanent stay of execution on this basis. At the hearing for Dhlamini and Mlambo on 4 March 1968, Beadle argued that he saw the statement from London as a decision by the UK government and not the Queen herself, and that in any case the 1961 constitution had transferred the <b>prerogative</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercy</b> from Britain to the Rhodesian Executive Council. [...] "The present government is the fully de facto government and as such is the only power that can exercise the prerogative", he concluded. [...] "It would be strange indeed if the United Kingdom government, exercising no internal power in Rhodesia, were given the right to exercise the prerogative of clemency." [...] The Judge President Sir Vincent Quenet and Justice Hector Macdonald agreed, and the application was dismissed. Justice John Fieldsend of the High Court's General Division resigned in protest, writing to Gibbs that he no longer believed the High Court to be defending the rights of Rhodesian citizens. Dhlamini, Mlambo and Shadreck were hanged on 6 March.|$|E

500|$|During the 1960s and 70s this {{attitude}} was changing, with Lord Denning {{saying in the}} Laker Airway case that [...] "seeing that the prerogative is a discretionary power to be exercised for the public good, it follows that its exercise can be examined by the courts just as any other discretionary power which is vested in the executive." [...] The most authoritative case on the matter is Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service, generally known as the GCHQ case. The House of Lords confirmed that the application of judicial review would be dependent {{on the nature of}} the government's powers, not their source. Foreign policy and national security powers are considered outside the scope of judicial review, while the <b>prerogative</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercy</b> is considered within it, as per R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Bentley.|$|E
500|$|Ruling on Madzimbamuto's {{appeal in}} January 1968, Beadle {{and three other}} judges decided that Smith's post-UDI order was not de jure but should be {{acknowledged}} as the de facto government {{by virtue of its}} [...] "effective control over the state's territory". Sir Robert Tredgold, the former Southern Rhodesian and Federal Chief Justice, told Gibbs that Beadle had thereby [...] "sold the pass" [...] and [...] "should be asked to leave Government House". The following month, considering the fate of James Dhlamini, Victor Mlambo and Duly Shadreck, three black Rhodesians sentenced to death before UDI for murder and terrorist offences, Beadle upheld Salisbury's power to execute the men. Whitehall reacted by announcing on 1 March 1968 that {{at the request of the}} UK government, the Queen had exercised the royal <b>prerogative</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercy</b> and commuted the sentences to life imprisonment.

500|$|The legal {{implications}} of GCHQ were that many areas once considered unreviewable were now potentially open to judicial scrutiny by the United Kingdom courts, {{except for a}} list of prerogatives that Lord Roskill provided as being non-reviewable [...] "because their nature and subject matter are such as not to be amenable to the judicial process". These included prerogative powers of treaty-making, the defence of the realm, the <b>prerogative</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercy,</b> the granting of honours, the dissolution of parliament, and the appointment of ministers. Subsequent case law shows that this list has largely been accepted, and there is indication that the judges have continued to move with a degree of circumspection, and sometimes even in reaction against such developments. However, in Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament v. Prime Minister (2002), Justice Maurice Kay accepted that the ambit of the [...] "forbidden areas" [...] identified by Lord Roskill is not immutable, and had been reduced in some cases.|$|E
500|$|The President of Rwanda is {{the head}} of state, and has broad powers {{including}} creating policy in conjunction with the Cabinet, exercising the <b>prerogative</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercy,</b> commanding the armed forces, negotiating and ratifying treaties, signing presidential orders, and declaring war or a state of emergency. The President is elected by popular vote every seven years, and appoints the Prime Minister and all other members of Cabinet. The incumbent President is Paul Kagame, who took office upon the resignation of his predecessor, Pasteur Bizimungu, in 2000. Kagame subsequently won elections in 2003 and 2010, although human rights organisations have criticised these elections as being [...] "marked by increasing political repression and a crackdown on free speech". Article 101 of the current constitution limits presidents to two terms in office, but [...] there is a motion underway in the Rwandan parliament to amend this and allow Kagame to run for a third term. The motion, which would require ratification by referendum, was brought following receipt of a petition signed by 3.8 million Rwandans.|$|E
500|$|The most noted {{prerogative}} {{power that}} affects the judicial system is the <b>prerogative</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercy,</b> which has two elements: the granting of pardons and the granting of nolle prosequi. Pardons may eliminate the [...] "pains, penalties and punishments" [...] from a criminal conviction, though they do not remove convictions themselves. This power is commonly exercised {{on the advice of}} the Secretary of State for the Home Department; the monarch has no direct involvement in its use. Exercises of this power may also take the form of commutations, a limited form of pardon where the sentences is reduced, on certain conditions. The granting of a pardon is not subject to judicial review, as confirmed by Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service, but the courts have chosen to criticise its application or lack thereof, as in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Bentley. Granting nolle prosequi is done by the Attorney General of England and Wales (or the equivalent in Scotland or Northern Ireland) {{in the name of the}} crown, to stop legal proceedings against an individual. This is not reviewable by the courts, as confirmed by R v Comptroller of Patents, and does not count as an acquittal; the defendant may be brought before the courts on the same charge at a later date.|$|E

The court further noted that [...] "here is nothing unusual in a capital sentence being mandatory" [...] since at common law all capital sentences were mandatory, and that if a capital sentence was discretionary this might reduce its deterrent effect. Also, the <b>prerogative</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercy</b> is available to Good Samaritans who find themselves involved in drug trafficking cases. The court's ruling that the mandatory death penalty is constitutional was applied by the Federal Court of Malaysia in Public Prosecutor v. Lau Kee Hoo (1982).|$|E
2500|$|Fusco {{was freed}} on bail on 21 March pending {{the outcome of}} his legal challenge, and in November 2000 the Irish {{government}} informed the High Court {{that it was no}} longer seeking to return him to Northern Ireland. This followed a statement from Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Mandelson saying that [...] "it is clearly anomalous to pursue the extradition of people who appear to qualify for early release under the Good Friday Agreement scheme, and who would, on making a successful application to the Sentence Review Commissioners, have little if any of their original prison sentence to serve". After the court hearing Fusco stated [...] "I'm relieved it's over", and that he would continue to live in Tralee with his family and work for Sinn Féin. In December 2000 Fusco and three other IRA members, including two other members of the M60 gang, were granted a Royal <b>Prerogative</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mercy</b> which allowed them to return to Northern Ireland without fear of prosecution.|$|E
2500|$|However, in the {{subsequent}} case Reyes v. The Queen (2002), the Privy Council found Ong Ah Chuan of limited assistance as it felt {{that at the time}} it was decided the jurisprudence on international human rights was [...] "rudimentary". The appellant in Reyes, who had been convicted of a double murder, appealed as to the constitutionality of the mandatory death sentence imposed on him. The Privy Council held that this penalty contravened the prohibition against inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment in section7 of the Constitution of Belize. While recognizing that the Constitution provides for the <b>prerogative</b> <b>of</b> <b>mercy</b> by vesting power to alter punishments in the Governor-General acting on the advice of an Advisory Council. However, this power was executive and not judicial in nature, and its existence could not remedy the constitutional defect in the sentencing process.
