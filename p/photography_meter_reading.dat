This study is aimed at {{designing}} and developing a new method for obtaining, displaying and sending the meter readings over 300 m distance. The proposed design is composed of three modules: Analog Meter, transmitter and receiver modules. The BASIC Stamp 2 (BS 2) microcontroller is used to display the received <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> data on the Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen and initiate a connection to send the obtained <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> data as Radio Frequency (RF) signal to the receiver module.

40|$|In this project, {{automatic}} <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> (AMR) {{has been}} studied. Automatic <b>meter</b> <b>reading</b> (AMR), is {{the technology of}} automatically collecting consumption, diagnostic, and status data from water meter or energy metering devices (gas, electric) and transferring that data to a central database for billing, troubleshooting, and analysing. This technology mainly saves utility providers the expense of periodic trips to each physical location to <b>read</b> a <b>meter.</b> Another advantage is that billing can be based on near real-time consumption rather than on estimates based on past or predicted consumption. AMR technologies include handheld, mobile and networktechnologies based on telephony platforms (wired and wireless), radio frequency (RF), or power line transmission. For this study, AMR system {{in the form of}} handheld device has been developed.
