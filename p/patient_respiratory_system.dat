30|$|The driving {{pressure}} of <b>respiratory</b> <b>system</b> (ΔP) during passive mechanical ventilation {{is defined as}} the difference between static end-inspiratory plateau pressure (Pplat) and static positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and equals the ratio of tidal volume (VT) to <b>respiratory</b> <b>system</b> compliance (Crs). Therefore, ΔP reflects the extent of lung stretch at end inspiration better than VT alone (when VT is set), because it takes into account <b>patient’s</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>system</b> compliance. Despite the fact that ΔP represents a global measurement of lung stretch and thus cannot capture lung inhomogeneity, recent studies have shown that ΔP is a main determinant of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and it is associated with mortality in ARDS patients, particularly at ΔP values above 14  cmH 2 O [1 – 6]. In addition, even in patients with uninjured lungs, an association between high ΔP and increased morbidity has been postulated [4, 7, 8].|$|R

40|$|Objective. In this paper, a new {{algorithm}} is proposed to compute the spontaneously generated respiratory effort during ventilation. Methods: The algorithm computes a ventilated <b>patient's</b> <b>respiratory</b> effort in real-time by analyzing the respiratory pressure and flow signals that are acquired from the ventilator. The method requires an initial period where the <b>patient's</b> <b>respiratory</b> muscles are fully relaxed, for example during or shortly after surgery. During this period the patient's inspiratory airway resistance R in, the expiratory airway resistance R ex, the lung-thorax compliance C lt and the residual pressure after an infinitely long expiration P 0 are estimated by fitting the measured flow onto the measured pressure at the mouth using {{a model of the}} <b>patient's</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>system.</b> When the <b>patient</b> starts breathing, the relation between the measured pressure and the flow changes, from which the respiratory effort of the patient P mus can be computed. Results: The pressure P mus can be computed in real-time by using an equivalent model of the <b>respiratory</b> <b>system</b> of the <b>patient.</b> The estimation can be done with a recursive least squares (RLS) method. Further, the resulting P mus signal appears to have a constant shape, in which the main changing factor is the maximum amplitude per breath. Conclusion: The respiratory effort increases over time until the patient is disconnected from the ventilator. We hope the maximum amplitude can be used as an indicator of the pressure the muscles of the patient are able to produce. This amplitude of the P mus-signal in combination with the standard deviation (SD) may eventually lead to a new indicator to determine the moment that the patient can be weaned from the ventilator.

40|$|Pulmonary {{infection}} on {{cystic fibrosis}} (CF) patients {{are associated with}} a limited qualitative number of microorganisms. During the colonization process, Staphylococcus aureus usually preceedes Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This latter is at first non-mucoid, being replaced or associated to a mucoid morphotype which is rare in other diseases. In 1980, Pseudomonas cepacia appeared as an important agent in CF pulmonary infections with a mean frequency of about 6. 1 % isolations {{in different parts of the}} world. The primus colonization mainly occurs in the presence of pre-existent tissue lesions and the clinical progress of the disease is variable. In some patients it can be fulminant; in others it can cause a gradual and slow decrease in their pulmonary functions. The concern with this germ isolation is justified by its antibiotic multiple resistence and the possibility of direct transmission from a colonized patient to a non-colonized one. We reported the first case of P. cepacia infection in a CF patient in our area. The microbiological attendance to this patient had been made from 1986 to 1991 and the first positive culture appeared in 1988.

40|$|Reports of {{pulmonary}} physiopathological insults following {{severe trauma}} resulting in respiratory failure {{are not new}} in medical literature 1, 2. In 1967 Ashbaugh and colleagues described a syndrome of acute respiratory distress following a variety of precipitating conditions 3. Severe hypoxemia, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, poor lung compliance and absence of left heart failure characterize this condition. Ashbaugh et al 4 subsequently named it as adult respiratory distress syndrome to differentiate it from infant respiratory distress syndrome. It was proposed {{at that time that}} both conditions manifest similar physiopathological changes. It was also referred to as “traumatic wet lung”, “congestive atelectasis”, or “Da Nang lung” and had a high mortality rate. Since these initial reports, researchers focused their attention towards ARDS in order to find out the precipitating factors and therapeutic measures one can take to treat it. From these observations emerged this concept that different systemic conditions and variety of insults to the lung are associated with ARDS clinical syndrome 5 and that it should be regarded as an extreme manifestation of a process called Acute Lung Injury (ALL). Murray quantified the severity of ARDS for determination of prognosis of patients suffering from this clinical syndrome.

The prevalent cause of pulmonary failure is ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) which increases morbidity and mortality. The respiratory dysfunction is mainly characterized by the presence of alveolar consolidation of the dependent lobes. METHODS: We investigated the mechanical changes of the <b>respiratory</b> <b>system</b> and the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in 10 normal subjects, in 10 brain injured <b>patients</b> without <b>respiratory</b> failure and in 10 brain injured <b>patients</b> with <b>respiratory</b> failure (PaO 2 /FiO 2 lower than 200 mmHg) due to VAP. RESULTS: We found that: 1) Intra-Abdominal Pressure (IAP) was increased in brain injured patients with or without respiratory failure compared to normal subjects; 2) the Elastance of <b>respiratory</b> <b>system</b> (Est,rs), the Elastance of the chest wall (Est,cw) and Resistance max of the Lung (Rmax,L) increased in brain injured patients independently from the presence of respiratory failure; 3) in brain injured <b>patients</b> with <b>respiratory</b> failure application of 15 cmH 2 O of PEEP increased the Elastance of the Lung (Est,L), Est,rs and Rmax,L, while did not result in significant alveolar recruitment and oxygenation improvement.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the acute effects on gas exchange, hemodynamics, and <b>respiratory</b> <b>system</b> mechanics of turning critically ill patients with ARDS from supine to prone. DESIGN: Open, prospective study. SETTING: General intensive care units. PATIENTS: 23 patients [mean age 56 +/- 17 (SD) years] who met ARDS criteria and had a Lung Injury Score > 2. 5 (mean 3. 25 +/- 0. 3). INTERVENTIONS: The decision to turn a patient was made using a protocol based on impaired oxygenation despite the use of positive end-expiratory pressure and a fractional inspired oxygen (FIO 2) of 1. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We measured gas exchange and hemodynamic variables in all patients and in 16 <b>patients</b> calculated <b>respiratory</b> <b>system</b> compliance when they were supine and 60 to 90 min after turning them to a prone position. This latter position was remarkably well tolerated and no clinically relevant complications or events were detected either during turning or while prone. The partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO 2) /FIO 2 ratio improved from 78 +/- 37 mm Hg supine to 115 +/- 31 mm Hg prone (p < 0. 001), and intrapulmonary shunt decreased from 43 +/- 11 to 34 +/- 8 % (p < 0. 001). Cardiac output and other hemodynamic parameters were not affected. <b>Respiratory</b> <b>system</b> compliance slightly improved from 24. 7 +/- 10. 2 ml/cmH 20 supine to 27. 8 +/- 13. 2 ml/cmH 20 prone (p < 0. 05). An improvement in PaO 2 /FIO 2 of more than 15 % from changing from supine to prone was found in 16 patients (responders). Responders had more hypoxemia (PaO 2 /FIO 2 70 +/- 23 vs 99 +/- 53 mm Hg in non-responders, p < 0. 01), more hypercapnia (partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (70 +/- 27 vs 64 +/- 9 mm Hg, p < 0. 01) and a shorter elapsed time to the onset of ARDS and turning to the prone position (11. 8 +/- 16 vs 32. 8 +/- 42 days, p < 0. 01).

Methods: Pulmonary function tests (PFTs), six-minute walk distance (6 -MWD) test, Arabic-translated chronic respiratory disease questionnaire-self administered standardized format (CRQ-SAS) and quality of life scale Short Form (SF- 36) were compared between 25 patients with moderate to severe COPD who underwent a two-month PR program (group 1) and 14 COPD patients who did not (group 2). Results: Group 1 showed significant improvement in the 6 -MWD, and HRQL scores at two months compared with the usual care patients in group 2 (P less than 0. 05). Improvement in both CRQ-SAS and SF- 36 scores were statistically significant and comparable in group 1. Conclusion: The supervised, post discharge, two-month home-based PR program is an effective non pharmacological intervention in the management of stable patients with COPD. The 6 -MWD is a simple, inexpensive and safe test to assess physical and functional capabilities among COPD patients. HRQL can be measured in patients with COPD either by disease-specific tools that have been specifically designed for use in <b>patients</b> with <b>respiratory</b> <b>system</b> disorders or by generic HRQL tools that can be used across populations with a variety of medical conditions. The Arabic-translated CRQ-SAS is a new tool for assessment of Arabic-speaking <b>patients</b> with chronic <b>respiratory</b> diseases...|$|R
40|$|Background : SOFA Score is a scoring sytem {{that can}} predict outcome of ICU <b>patient,</b> it asses <b>respiratory</b> <b>system,</b> kidney, hepar, kardiovascular, hematology, and GCS that {{associated}} with multiple organ failure and mortality rate. Sepsis patients are {{the sample of}} this research, because sepsis can cause mortality and morbidity of patient that stay on hospital. {{there is a strong}} connection between multiple organ failure and length of stay ICU patient that make reasercher curious to find association between SOFA Score and Length of Stay ICU Patient. Aim : to prove association between SOFA score with length of stay sepsis patient in ICU RSUP Dr. Kariadi Semarang Period 1 January – 30 June 2013 Method : an observational cross sectional analytic study. 45 sample that taken from 165 of sepsis patient at ICU, then traced data on medical record. observed data is patient characteristic, length of stay, and fisiological variable on the first day at ICU. Data analysis was using Sperman test. Results : there is no association between SOFA Score and length of stay sepsis patient at ICU (p = 0, 158 and r = - 0, 214) Conclusion : SOFA Score cannot predict length of stay sepsis patient at IC...|$|R
