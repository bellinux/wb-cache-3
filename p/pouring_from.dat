Felicity has been sacked after she was accused of sexual harassment. Laura arrives to congratulate Jim, and he thanks her for encouraging him. He is distant, eventually asking her to leave him to prepare alone. As he puts on his crown in front of the mirror, he hears the sound of whispering, and sees blood <b>pouring</b> <b>from</b> both his eyes and the mirror.|$|E
25|$|The Horse {{were allowed}} to rest and receive {{replacement}} vehicles and men for several months after the Tunisian actions. It has been surmised that this is because General Montgomery {{did not believe the}} Churchill tank to be a practical vehicle for the Italian campaign. Nevertheless, the regiment embarked on 16 April for Naples, coming under air attack as it entered the harbour two days later. Vesuvius could be seen just a few miles away with fire and smoke <b>pouring</b> <b>from</b> its brim, having erupted just several weeks earlier on 19 March.|$|E
25|$|The {{commemoration}} ceremony {{began with}} a flotilla of police and other government vessels passing beneath the bridge, before Government Flying Service and Royal Air Force aircraft flew above the concrete towers. Thatcher, Chief Secretary Anson Chan, and Governor Chris Patten then switched on the bridge lights and drove across the span with other dignitaries. The celebration concluded with a 20-minute firework and laser show, featuring fire <b>pouring</b> <b>from</b> {{the length of the}} bridge, engineered by the Pyromagic Productions company. Chief Executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa declined to attend as he said he would rather meet with officials in Guangdong.|$|E

25|$|As {{officers}} {{searched for}} shooters inside the building, others aided the wounded. Probation officers initially {{set up a}} makeshift triage center near {{the entrance of the}} building, but deemed it to be too close and relocated it across the street by 11:15a.m. Because survivors were soaked from water <b>pouring</b> <b>from</b> the fire sprinkler pipe, they became slippery for officers to hold. Injured victims were carried out by hand, with blankets, and even on chairs, as litters and tactical stretchers were unavailable at the time. An SBPD tactical medic supervised the extraction operation. It took 57 minutes to get the last of the injured to a hospital.|$|E
25|$|Roof {{and floor}} screeds and {{insulating}} concretes: exfoliated vermiculite (typically the finer grades) {{can be added}} at site to Portland cement and other aggregates, rheological aids, and water to produce roof and floor concrete screeds which are lightweight and insulating. In many cases, vermiculite-based roof screeds are {{used in conjunction with}} other insulation materials, such as polystyrene board, to form a total roofing system. A bituminous binder can also be used with exfoliated vermiculite to produce a dry, lightweight roof screed which has the advantages of low thermal conductivity, low moisture content, and ease of placement (by <b>pouring</b> <b>from</b> the bag and then tamping).|$|E
25|$|Eomer's {{next stop}} takes {{him to the}} town of Snowbourn on the river of the same name. The Third Marshall deems the entire Eastemnet not defensible, with Isengard forces coming from the west, Mordor orcs <b>pouring</b> <b>from</b> the south and Easterlings {{crossing}} the river from the east. By his military power, he orders all people remaining in those lands to abandon their homes and move westward across the Entwash river, where they can be better defended. Fastred, the Thane ("Major") of Snowbourn openly defies this order, however, refusing to abandon his position and leading bold strikes against orc forces instead. Angered at the insubordination, Eomer decides to bring this matter directly {{to the attention of the}} King.|$|E
5000|$|The priest will purify {{the shrine}} {{and call the}} {{attention}} of benevolent spirits, or kami. Then, the priest announces {{the beginning of the}} san-san-ku-do ceremony, or [...] "three-three-nine-times," [...] reflecting three oaths taken three times, represented by three cups, poured three times, and swallowed in three sips. This often includes three <b>pourings</b> <b>from</b> three cups of increasing sizes. The first, smallest cup, is first poured to the groom, who drinks from it before offering it to the bride. The second pouring goes first to the bride, then to the groom. The final <b>pouring</b> goes <b>from</b> the groom first, then the bride (essentially repeating the first pour).|$|R

25|$|The first {{explosion}} ignited {{ammonium nitrate}} {{in the nearby}} cargo ship High Flyer. The crews spent hours attempting to cut the High Flyer free from her anchor and other obstacles, without success. After smoke had been <b>pouring</b> <b>from</b> the hold for over five hours, and about 15 hours after the explosions aboard the Grandcamp, the High Flyer exploded, demolishing the nearby SS Wilson B. Keene, killing {{at least two more}} and increasing the damage to the port and other ships with more shrapnel and burning material. One of the propellers on the High Flyer was blown off, and subsequently found nearly a mile inland. It is now part of a memorial park, and sits near the anchor of the Grandcamp. The propeller is cracked in several places, and one blade has a large piece missing.|$|E
25|$|After {{his return}} to the front, he was wounded in the throat by a sniper's bullet. At 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Orwell was {{considerably}} taller than the Spanish fighters and had been warned against standing against the trench parapet. Unable to speak, and with blood <b>pouring</b> <b>from</b> his mouth, Orwell was carried on a stretcher to Siétamo, loaded on an ambulance and after a bumpy journey via Barbastro arrived at the hospital at Lérida. He recovered sufficiently to get up and on 27 May 1937 was sent on to Tarragona and two days later to a POUM sanatorium in the suburbs of Barcelona. The bullet had missed his main artery by the barest margin and his voice was barely audible. It had been such a clean shot that the wound immediately went through the process of cauterisation. He received electrotherapy treatment and was declared medically unfit for service.|$|E
25|$|On lap 15, Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel {{came into}} the pits. Hamilton rejoined in sixth place but Vettel's fuel pump failed to work {{so he had to}} come in again. Kovalainen came in a lap later while Barrichello was pushing to try and build a gap. Button and Räikkönen pitted on lap 18, the Finn coming out in eighth while Button rejoined in 11th. Barrichello came in on lap 19, the Brazilian had made a lot of ground as he rejoined just behind Lewis after being around 10 seconds adrift. But most {{importantly}} for Brawn he had jumped the other McLaren of Kovalainen. On lap 24, a lot of smoke was <b>pouring</b> <b>from</b> the rear end of Vettel's car and he retired with a suspected engine failure. Hamilton was ordered over the radio to try to cool down his rear brakes as the temperature were getting out of control, but he was unable to shake off the challenge of Barrichello in second.|$|E

500|$|The second team, officer Herb Frauenberger and his partner, Tony Palma, {{arrived a}} few minutes later. They found Lennon lying {{face down on the}} floor of the {{reception}} area, blood <b>pouring</b> <b>from</b> his mouth, and his clothing already soaked with blood, with Hastings attending to him. Realizing the extent of Lennon's injuries, the policemen decided not to wait for an ambulance, immediately carried him into their squad car, and rushed him to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. Officer James Moran said they placed Lennon in the back seat.|$|E
500|$|Around the mid-18th century {{a series}} of eruptions {{produced}} Cinder Cone in {{the northeast corner of}} the park, mantling an area of [...] with ejecta in the process. Ash falling on the streams of lava <b>pouring</b> <b>from</b> the cone's east flank formed the Painted Dunes. A flow of quartz-studded basalt lava (the Fantastic Lava Beds) poured from the Cinder Cone and dammed the streams that fed nearby Butte Lake to the north, forming Snag Lake to the south. In the late 18th century Cinder Cone had its most recent eruption and lava flow.|$|E

500|$|The ships arrived off Scarlet {{beach on}} time, and the destroyers {{conducted}} a short 11-minute preliminary bombardment. It was doubtful if any Japanese positions were hit or any casualties inflicted. Low cloud trapped {{the smoke and}} dust produced by the bombardment. To the Australians, it was [...] "dark as {{the inside of a}} cow". Scarlet Beach and Siki Cove were covered by bunker-type pillboxes made of logs, spaced about [...] apart, and connected by shallow trenches. They held about 300 Japanese defenders. Japanese tracer fire started <b>pouring</b> <b>from</b> the shore. At this point, one Australian recalled [...] "I realised that this was not an unopposed landing." [...] It was the first opposed landing by Australian troops since the Landing at Anzac Cove in the Gallipoli Campaign of 1915.|$|E
