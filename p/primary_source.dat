40|$|Using <b>primary</b> <b>sources</b> {{in history}} classes {{is all the}} rage” (Barton, 2005). The growing {{popularity}} of <b>primary</b> <b>sources</b> requires teachers to examine and understand the effectiveness of using <b>primary</b> <b>sources</b> in order to teach history. This research study investigated how the use of <b>primary</b> <b>sources</b> affects students’ understanding of history. Our {{first step in the}} research process was to survey students after two lessons that used <b>primary</b> <b>sources</b> and to document the students’ academic responses to the lesson. Our next step was to interview the teacher who taught the lesson using <b>primary</b> <b>sources.</b> Our final step included analyzing the data we compiled. Our results were consistent with our literature review. The benefits of using <b>primary</b> <b>sources</b> can be grouped into two major themes: developing a critical and comprehensive understanding of history and creating a relevant and meaningful learning experience for students. There is also a risk in using <b>primary</b> <b>sources</b> if they are not presented correctly. In addition to finding these results, we discovered that using <b>primary</b> <b>sources</b> helps build historical empathy in students. Our study is significant because we are contributing to a very current issue in the educational world. An Editor 2 ̆ 7 s Note is available at [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Until recently, few K- 12 {{teachers}} {{outside of}} social studies have integrated <b>primary</b> <b>sources</b> in classroom instruction. Integrating <b>primary</b> <b>sources</b> in educational practice does require an uncommon pedagogical understanding. Addressing this K- 12 educator need is the Library of Congress. Recently, the Library implemented a national educator professional development program, Teaching with <b>Primary</b> <b>Sources</b> (TPS). The TPS program operates at multiple universities and colleges, including Loyola University Chicago. This program aims to educate K- 12 educators of all subject-areas to integrate online, digitized <b>primary</b> <b>sources</b> into classroom practices. This study addressed questions related to the outcomes of teacher participants 2 ̆ 7 classroom practices after completing a TPS graduate course at Loyola. Results of this study revealed changes in teachers 2 ̆ 7 practices. K- 12 teachers of all subject areas, student age groups and ability levels, reported increases in types and frequencies of <b>primary</b> <b>sources</b> used in a given month. Reasons teachers used <b>primary</b> <b>sources</b> were wide ranging. The most common reason reported was for inferential and analytical skill increases, meanwhile, meeting learning standards was least recognized. Teachers 2 ̆ 7 reported classroom practices noted uses of <b>primary</b> <b>sources</b> to: illustrate concepts; provide examples; enhance secondary sources; to assist in student increases in higher order thinking skills; assess formatively and summatively, and cross-subject areas and grade levels.

40|$|With the {{widespread}} {{adoption of the}} Common Core State Standards, K- 12 teachers are required to utilize <b>primary</b> <b>sources</b> as tools to promote inquiry-based learning. This dissertation used ethnographic methods to investigate how teachers integrate <b>primary</b> <b>sources</b> into classroom instruction by gathering qualitative data on their information practices and the forms of knowledge they draw on when finding, evaluating, and using <b>primary</b> <b>sources</b> to promote inquiry-based education. The investigation resulted in a rich description of the information practices and forms of scholarly and professional knowledge used throughout different stages of the integration process. The {{first phase of the}} study consists of semi-structured interviews with teachers from four different school districts. The interviews were used to gather data on teachers' beliefs surrounding inquiry-based education and experiences teaching with <b>primary</b> <b>sources.</b> The second phase of the study consists of a nine-month participant observation period at a laboratory school. The study was designed to observe daily activities and collect implicit experience-based information, including the types of tacit knowledge associated with the act of teaching with <b>primary</b> <b>sources.</b> The investigation largely focused on understanding the practices related to how teachers find, evaluate, and use <b>primary</b> <b>sources.</b> By examining the practices of teachers who are actively teaching with <b>primary</b> <b>sources,</b> this dissertation disentangles the complex relationship between unstated educational practices, national educational standards, and the archival processes that are undertaken as part of classroom instruction, such as locating <b>primary</b> <b>sources</b> for lesson planning. The study values the experiences of teachers as a source of practical knowledge that can inform theoretical knowledge and promote intelligent practice among both teachers and archivists. Ultimately, this study is an opportunity to perform proof of concept work for the field of archival studies that can improve information services for K- 12 teachers and allow information professionals to play an enhanced role in promoting collaborative efforts between schools, libraries, and archival repositories...|$|R
