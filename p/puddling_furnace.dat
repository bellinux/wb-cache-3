25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Hall {{discovered}} that the addition of iron oxide {{to the charge of}} the <b>puddling</b> <b>furnace</b> caused a violent reaction, in which the pig iron was decarburised, this became known as 'wet puddling'. It was also found possible to produce steel by stopping the puddling process before decarburisation was complete.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} major types of {{puddling}} furnaces {{used in the}} United States. The first is the single <b>puddling</b> <b>furnace,</b> {{which is based on}} the same design used in England and, thus, the most common. The second kind is the double <b>puddling</b> <b>furnace,</b> which was most often found on the east of the Allegheny Mountains.|$|E

50|$|In 1860 Domingo Goitia, Martín Usabiaga and José Francisco Arana {{established}} this company, {{whose main}} activity was <b>puddling</b> <b>furnaces</b> and cylinder rolling.|$|R
50|$|The 1860s {{were good}} {{years for the}} company. In 1869 the company was valued at around £250,000 (an {{increase}} from around £150,00 on James Foster's death). It was operating 95 wrought iron producing <b>puddling</b> <b>furnaces</b> at this time.|$|R
50|$|As of 1911, Haspe {{was located}} on the railway from Düsseldorf to Dortmund, ten miles {{north-east}} of Barmen by rail. Its industries included iron foundries, rolling mills, <b>puddling</b> <b>furnaces,</b> and the manufacturing of iron, steel, and brass wares and of machines.|$|R
50|$|A double <b>puddling</b> <b>furnace</b> is {{very similar}} to that of the single <b>puddling</b> <b>furnace,</b> with the major {{difference}} being there are two work doors allowing two puddlers to work the furnace at the same time. The biggest advantage of this setup is that it produces twice as much wrought iron. It's also more economical and fuel efficient as compared to a single furnace.|$|E
50|$|The <b>puddling</b> <b>furnace,</b> {{introduced}} by Henry Cort in the 1780s {{to replace the}} older finery process, was also a variety of reverberatory furnace.|$|E
50|$|In 1806 he {{inherited}} the factories of the Chapel family. He introduced a reverbatory furnace for melting metal in 1807, in 1821 the first <b>Puddling</b> <b>furnace</b> in Belgium (with J.M. Orban).|$|E
50|$|Lord Granville owned {{coal and}} {{ironstone}} mines at Stoke-on-Trent {{and was the}} principal shareholder of the Shelton Iron & Steel Co In 1873 the company operated 8 blast <b>furnaces</b> and 97 <b>puddling</b> <b>furnaces.</b> He also held shares in the Lilleshall Company.|$|R
50|$|In 1836 the Englishman Thomas Bonehill built <b>puddling</b> <b>furnaces</b> for the Puissant and Licot de Nîmes families; in 1838 {{the company}} Société Anonyme des laminoirs, forges, fonderies et usines de la Providence {{was formed by}} Clément-Joseph Delbruyère {{together}} with Edmond et Jules Puissant and Thomas Bonehill with a permitted capital of 1500,000 francs in order to construct a coke fire blast furnace, together with other equipment from Puissant and Bonehill's company la société le grand laminoir de la Providence, including steam engines (50 and 80 hp), and metal working equipment including hammers, four rolling mills, shears, <b>puddling</b> <b>furnaces,</b> casting equipment and molds as well as associated land, workshops and offices, and refractory brick manufacturing facilities.|$|R
50|$|While {{arguably the}} first {{primitive}} {{open hearth furnace}} was the Catalan forge, invented in Spain in the 8th century, it is usual to confine the term to certain 19th-century and later steelmaking processes, thus excluding bloomeries (including the Catalan forge), finery forges, and <b>puddling</b> <b>furnaces</b> from its application.|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} aspect of the Industrial Revolution was the development of large-scale methods of producing forgeable metal (bar iron or steel). The <b>puddling</b> <b>furnace</b> was initially a means of producing wrought iron, but was later applied to steel production.|$|E
50|$|Around the 1840s, {{developments}} in the <b>puddling</b> <b>furnace</b> reduced the cost of wrought iron and improvements to rolling mills allowed the production of large flat sections. This iron was now economic {{for the construction of}} girders, assembled by riveting of flat sections.|$|E
5000|$|Together the {{two sites}} {{contained}} sixty <b>puddling</b> <b>furnaces,</b> twenty heating furnaces, fourteen trains of rolls, three rotary squeezers, nine horseshoe machines, twelve rivet machines which each produced eighty rivets a minute, ten large and fifteen small steam engines, seventy boilers, {{and the great}} water-wheel. The <b>puddling</b> <b>furnaces</b> employed hundreds of men, stripped to the waist, wearing hob-nailed shoes, and covered in coal dust. Boys worked at the swaging furnaces, removing the heated horseshoes with tongs and placing them on the revolving dies of the swaging machine. Burden's works manufactured horseshoes {{in a variety of}} patterns and sizes. They were packed for shipping 100 lbs. to a keg. [...] A network of railroad tracks moved trainloads of iron ore, and sand among the blast furnaces and steam mills. The company owned its own locomotive.|$|R
50|$|Ironworks succeed bloomeries when blast {{furnaces}} replaced former methods. An integrated ironworks in the 19th century usually included {{one or more}} {{blast furnaces}} {{and a number of}} <b>puddling</b> <b>furnaces</b> or a foundry with or without other kinds of ironworks. After the invention of the Bessemer process, converters became widespread, and the appellation steelworks replaced ironworks.|$|R
50|$|Thomas Walmsley and Sons was {{a company}} that {{manufactured}} wrought iron. It was founded in 1866 or 1869 by Thomas Walmsley at the Atlas Forge on a site bounded by Bridgeman Street and Fletcher Street in Bolton, then in Lancashire, England. The forge had at least 16 <b>puddling</b> <b>furnaces</b> and forging and rolling mills.|$|R
50|$|Throughout its existence, the Adirondack Iron Works {{operated}} two farms, {{the blast}} furnace and forge, a <b>puddling</b> <b>furnace,</b> charcoal and brick kilns, trip hammers and a grist and saw mill. The Village consisted of sixteen dwellings and a {{building with a}} cupola, used as school, church and the general assembly room.|$|E
50|$|The ancient corn mill at Bedlington {{was taken}} over in 1759 by Malings & Co of Sunderland, who built a blast furnace for foundry work. However {{they did not do}} well. Later there was a forge driven by a huge water wheel and a <b>puddling</b> <b>furnace</b> which needed the coal that was all around.|$|E

50|$|<b>Puddling</b> <b>furnaces</b> — a later {{process for}} the same purpose, again with coke as fuel. It was usually {{necessary}} {{for there to be}} a preliminary refining process in a coke refinery (also called running out <b>furnace).</b> After <b>puddling,</b> the puddled ball needed shingling and then to be drawn out into bar iron in a rolling mill.|$|R
50|$|The {{organisation}} Société Bouguéret, Martenot et Cie. {{was formed}} in 1846 from the merging of the businesses of forgemasters in Allier and Châtillon. The founders of the company include members of the families Bouguéret, Martenot, Bazile, Rambourg, Maître, Humbert and others; the new société had 37 blast furnaces, 56 forges, 3 wire works, and 4 <b>puddling</b> <b>furnaces.</b>|$|R
50|$|By the mid-1870s, the Old Colony Iron Company {{manufactured}} more nails {{than any}} other company in New England - as much as 130,000 kegs per year. By 1876, the equipment of the company included: 5 double and 6 single <b>puddling</b> <b>furnaces,</b> 9 heating furnaces, 96 nail machines, 5 trains of rolls and 5 hammers, operating on both water and steam power.|$|R
50|$|Onions {{was born}} in Broseley, Shropshire, later moving to Merthyr Tydfil in Wales. He married Elizabeth Guest, sister of John Guest, a founder of Guest, Keen and Nettlefold, which is today the British {{conglomerate}} GKN In 1783, Onions received patent number 1370 for his invention. Henry Cort later improved on Onion's process during the development of his <b>puddling</b> <b>furnace.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Gourju family {{settled in}} Apprieu in 1842 {{to restart the}} old forges of Bonpertuis known since 1569 and {{probably}} much earlier in the Carthusian period. Alphonse Gourju (ironmaster from Rives), Renage, and Brignoud from the valley of Gresivaudan installed a remarkable <b>puddling</b> <b>furnace</b> at Bonpertuis which is well preserved today. The tradition of ironworking was continued by the Experton family.|$|E
50|$|In 1820s, Foster {{entered into}} a {{partnership}} with George Jones and John Barker, both of Wolverhampton, to construct the Chillington Ironworks. The three partners patented an improved method of producing malleable iron in 1832. They invented a method of conveying the molten iron produced in a blast furnace into the <b>puddling</b> <b>furnace</b> without the intermediate stage of producing solid pig iron.|$|E
5000|$|Manufacture of Iron.-Combination of iron with carbon, sulphur, {{treatment}} of the ore, roasting, blast furnaces, metal produced, hot blast, pig casting, moulding in green and dry sand, loam, clay; cores, boxes, malleable cast iron; refining, German method; English <b>puddling</b> <b>furnaces,</b> steel - shear and blister, cast steel, tempering, working iron, tilt hammers, drop steam hammers, rolls, plate rolls, wire drawing, and annealing.|$|R
50|$|Cort's {{marriage}} to Elizabeth Heysham produced 13 children. His business ventures {{did not bring}} him wealth, even though vast numbers of the <b>puddling</b> <b>furnaces</b> that he developed were eventually used (reportedly 8,200 by 1820), they used {{a modified version of}} his process and thus avoided payment of royalties. He was later awarded a government pension, but died a ruined man, and was buried in the churchyard of St John-at-Hampstead, London.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{pig iron}} was worked into wrought iron in finery forges, later <b>puddling</b> <b>furnaces,</b> and more {{recently}} into steel. In these processes, pig iron is melted and a strong current of air is directed over it while it is stirred or agitated. This causes the dissolved impurities (such as silicon) to be thoroughly oxidized. An intermediate product of puddling is known as refined pig iron, finers metal, or refined iron.|$|R
50|$|Fontley House in Iron Mill Lane was the {{residence}} of Samuel Jellicoe from about 1784 {{until his death in}} 1812. He was the partner of Henry Cort of Fontley Iron Mills, next door to the house. Cort was the inventor of the rolling mill and the <b>puddling</b> <b>furnace,</b> important for the production of iron during the Napoleonic Wars. Some of Cort's inventions were tried out at these mills.|$|E
50|$|In 1830, {{with the}} {{financial}} support of others he established the Bloomfield Ironworks at Tipton, the firm becoming Bailey, Barrows and Hall in 1834. In 1838, he patented the use of 'bulldog' (roasted tap cinder) to protect the iron bottom plate of the <b>puddling</b> <b>furnace</b> (Patent no.7778 21 August 1838). In 1849, he moved to small house at Handsworth but continued to visit the works occasionally. He died there in 1862.|$|E
5000|$|... "In 1831 {{the furnace}} and forge were sold by Thomas, Richard and Edward Snowden to Evan T. Ellicott and Company, who erected another furnace, 28 {{feet high and}} 8 feet wide at the boshes, and a <b>puddling</b> <b>furnace</b> and {{roughing}} mills or converting pig iron into bars for the Avalon works above Relay." [...] (The site of the Avalon Works is located in today's Patapsco Valley State Park).|$|E
5|$|Alternatively {{pig iron}} {{may be made}} into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various {{processes}} {{have been used for}} this, including finery forges, <b>puddling</b> <b>furnaces,</b> Bessemer converters, open hearth furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, and electric arc furnaces. In all cases, the objective is to oxidize {{some or all of the}} carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.|$|R
50|$|The Mount Savage Iron Works {{operated}} from 1837 to 1868 in Mount Savage, Maryland. The ironworks {{were the}} largest in the United States in the late 1840s, and the first in the nation to produce heavy rails for construction of railroads. The works were established in an area adjacent to mines for coal, iron ore and fire clay. Facilities included blast <b>furnaces,</b> <b>puddling</b> <b>furnaces,</b> a rolling mill, iron refineries, coke production and brick production.|$|R
5000|$|Built on the [...] "Long Calm" [...] {{portion of}} the Big Gunpowder River in eastern Baltimore County, Maryland, the plant was started as a {{slitting}} and nail-making company. Located about 0.75 mile below current-day Maryland Route 7, it eventually had six <b>puddling</b> <b>furnaces,</b> one heating furnace, and 37 water-powered nail machines. Until the original dam was built at the Loch Raven Reservoir in 1881, the water depth at the Joppa Iron Works site was much deeper, facilitating shipments {{in and out of}} the area by seagoing vessels.|$|R
