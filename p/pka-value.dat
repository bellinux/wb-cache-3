The cooperation between forces is, however, perplexing and not well understood. In order to elucidate and predict protein folding and stability, detailed studies of non-covalent interactions are required. Presented in this thesis are detailed studies on electrostatic interactions in proteins and their contribution to protein stability for PGB 1, the protein G B 1 domain from Streptococcus sp. Electrostatic interactions were investigated both by means of thermal and chemical denaturation at various pH and salt concentrations using CD spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry, and by site-specific <b>pKa-value</b> determination using heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Investigations of electrostatic interactions both in the folded and unfolded states of the protein were conducted. The results show strong electrostatic coupling between charges in the native protein that was not efficiently screened by salt. In the unfolded state most charge-charge interactions were reduced. Novel methods in analyzing NMR titration data are introduced and used to reveal electrostatic coupling. Moreover, the relative contribution of pKa-shift arising from direct Coulomb interactions, hydrogen bonding and desolvation was elucidated. Using experimentally determined pKa-values of the folded and unfolded states the pH dependent stability could be accurately calculated and compared to denaturation studies. This thesis moreover contains results from research aiming at stabilizing proteins. The same non-covalent interactions govern the stability of an intact protein chain and the affinity between fragments of the chain, which is made use of in the novel method. Reconstituting fragments of a protein were cloned into a split-GFP system where assembly of fused fragments was visualized by green fluorescence. It was shown that the fluorescence intensity correlated to the affinity between fused fragments. In a subsequent study the fluorescence intensity was used to screen for stabilized variants from a small, focused library of PGB 1. Increased green fluorescence revealed enhanced stability of intact chain as observed from denaturation studies. Based on thermodynamic principles and in vivo screening the method shows promising results in screening of larger libraries for optimization of protein stability...|$|E

Therefore, the mixture is especially prone as a base for nucleophilic displacement reactions. This simple and inexpensive reagent has already been used for the alkylation of OH groups in phenols and alcohols 4 - 5 and of the nitrogens of carboxylic amides 6 with high yields. The reaction of ketones with an alkylation reagent in presence of strong bases is an attractive way for the preparation of peralkylated ketones. However, peralkylations are reported to be achieved by stepwise reactions. 7 The use of NaH in THF is an essential improvement. 8 Solid KOH has been appli-cated in toluene as a solvent, ' but crown ether had to be added. The basicity of the reagent KOH/DMSO is high enough for the direct al-kylation of ketones in CL position, and the preparation procedure can be car-ried out in a very simple manner. 10 All reagents can be used without drying, for the solid KOH binds small amounts of water. l- 3 Technical grade KOH can be applicated in pellets without further purification.

40|$|The air kerma area product PKA is an {{important}} quantity used by hospital physicists in quality assurance and optimization processes in diagnostic radiology and is recommended by national authorities for setting of diagnostic reference levels. PKA can be measured using a transmission ionization chamber (kerma area product (KAP) meter) mounted on the collimator housing. Its signal QKAP must be calibrated to give values of PKA. The objective of this thesis is to analyze the factors influencing {{the accuracy of the}} calibration coefficients k= PKA/QKAP and of reported <b>PKA-values.</b> Due to attenuation and scatter in the KAP-meter and presence of extra-focal radiation, values of PKA depend on the choice of integration area A and the distance of the reference plane from the focal spot yielding values of PKA that may differ by as much as 23 % depending on this choice. The two extremes correspond to (1) PKA=PKA,o integrated over the exit surface of the KAP-meter resulting in geometry independent calibration coefficients and (2) PKA=PKA,Anom integrated over the nominal beam area in the patient entrance plane resulting in geometry dependent calibration coefficients. Three calibration methods are analysed. Method 1 aims at determine PKA,Anom, for clinical use at the patient entrance plane. At standard laboratories, the method is used to calibrate with respect to radiation incident on the KAP-meter. Problems with extra-focal and scattered radiation are then avoided resulting in calibration coefficients with low standard uncertainty (± 1. 5 %, coverage factor 2). Method 2 was designed in this work to approach determination of PKA,o using thermoluminescent detectors to monitor contributions from extra-focal radiation and account for the heel effect. The uncertainty in derived calibration coefficients was ± 3 % (coverage factor 2). Method 3 uses a Master KAP-meter calibrated at a standard laboratory for incident radiation to calibrate clinical KAP-meters. It has potential to become the standard method in the future replacing the tedious method 2 for calibrations aiming at determination of PKA,o. Commercially available KAP-meters use conducting layers of indium oxide causing a strong energy dependence of their calibration coefficients. This dependence is investigated using Monte Carlo simulations and measurements. It may introduce substantial uncertainties in reported PKA– values since calibration coefficients as obtained from standard laboratories are often available only at one filtration (2. 5 mm Al) as function of tube voltage or HVL. This is not sufficient since higher filtrations are commonly used in practice, including filters of Cu. In extreme cases, calibration coefficients for the same value of HVL but using different tube voltages and filtrations can deviate by as much as 30 %. If standardised calibration methods are not used and choice of calibration coefficients not carefully chosen with respect to beam quality, the total uncertainty in reported <b>PKA–values</b> may be as large as 40 - 45 %. Conversion of <b>PKA-values</b> to risk related quantities is briefly discussed.

40|$|A new {{alginate}} gelling {{system was}} recently reported where chitosan oligomers {{were used to}} cross-link alginate (poly-M) (Khong et al., 2013). These results have been followed up by determining the gel strength and syneresis of two different commercial alginates, said leaf alginate (FM = 0. 54) and stipe alginate (FM = 0. 32) from Laminaria hyperborea, that were cross-linked with combinations of calcium and a chitosan oligomer mixture (Article in preparation: Alginate Gels with a Combination of Calcium and Chitosan Oligomer Mixtures as Crosslinkers). The {{purpose of the present}} master thesis has been to determine the swelling properties of two alginate gels, the first is a leaf alginate gel cross-linked with a combination of calcium and chitosan oligomer mixture (50 / 50 mixture), and the second a stipe alginate gel cross-linked with a combination of calcium and chitosan oligomer mixture (75 / 25 mixture). These two gels where selected because they exhibited a similar gel strength as pure calcium gels without significant syneresis (Article in preparation: Alginate Gels with a Combination of Calcium and Chitosan Oligomer Mixtures as Crosslinkers). The chitosan oligomer mixture and the two alginates were first characterized with respect to their chemical composition and for the alginate, also their diad and triad sequences and average block lengths. The swelling of the gels was determined at four different pH-values (4. 5, 5. 5, 7. 5 and 8. 5) both in buffer solutions and where 100 mM NaCl was added. In order to compare the swelling of the combined gels, the swelling behaviour of pure calcium alginate gels at the four different pH-values were first determined. Both swelling kinetics and swelling after 24 and 48 hours were investigated. At pH 4. 5 and 5. 5, where alginate and chitosan oligomers are both fully charged, the mixed alginate gels exhibited marginally lower swelling compared to the pure calcium gels in buffer solutions with and without salt. A significant increase in swelling was observed for the mixed alginate gels at higher pH of 7. 5 and 8. 5, whereas swelling behaviour of calcium alginate gels was similar to what was observed in the acidic conditions. These results suggested that chitosan oligomers contributed to cross-links, both above and below the pKa of chitosan. This was supported by a swelling control study where the calcium content of the alginate gels was reduced to a similar amount of the mixed gels (but without the chitosan oligomers). The swelling kinetic results revealed that the mixed alginate gels swelled faster at pH values above the pKa of chitosan s amino groups (<b>pKa-value</b> of 6. 5) compared to at the lower pH values and compared to calcium alginate gels. This more non-Fickian behaviour was most likely attributed to the reduced charge density of chitosan oligomers at the higher pH-values, decreasing the ionic association with alginate which consequently increase the stiffness of the gel as the polymer chain repulsion is increased. In addition, a size exclusion chromatography (SEC) study of the chain lengths of chitosan oligomers leaking out of the gel was performed on leaf alginate combined with a chitosan oligomer mixture. It was found that higher DP chitosan oligomers (DP > 3) diffused slower out of the gel, indicating an increased interaction of longer oligomers within the leaf alginate...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. A {{pharmaceutical}} {{dosage form}} is an entity that is administered to patients so that they receive an effective dose of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The proper design and formulation of a transdermal dosage form require {{a thorough understanding of}} the physiological factors affecting percutaneous penetration and physicochemical characteristics of the API, {{as well as that of}} the pharmaceutical exipients that are used during formulation. The API and pharmaceutical excipients must be compatible with one another to produce a formulation that is stable, efficacious, attractive, easy to administer, and safe (Mahato, 2007 : 11). Amongst others, the physicochemical properties indicate the suitability of the type of dosage form, as well as any potential problems associated with instability, poor permeation and the target site to be reached (Wells & Aulton, 2002 : 337). Therefore, when developing new or improved dosage forms, it is of utmost importance to evaluate the factors influencing design and formulation to provide the best possible dosage form and formulation for the API in question. Delivery of an API through the skin has long been a promising concept due to its large surface area, ease of access, vast exposure to the circulatory and lymphatic networks, and non-invasive nature of the therapy. This is true whether a local or systemic pharmacological effect is desired (Aukunuru et al., 2007 : 856). However, most APIs are administered orally as this route is considered to be the simplest, most convenient and safest route of API administration. Since ibuprofen is highly metabolised in the liver and gastrointestinal tract, oral administration thereof results in decreased bioavailability. Furthermore, it also causes gastric mucosal damage, bleeding and ulceration. Another obstacle associated with oral API delivery is that some APIs require continuous delivery which is difficult to achieve (Bouwstra et al., 2003 : 3). Therefore, there is significant interest to develop topical dosage forms for ibuprofen to avoid side effects associated with oral delivery and to provide relatively consistent API levels at the application site for prolonged periods (Rhee et al., 2003 : 14). The aim of this study was to determine the influence of selected formulation factors on the transdermal delivery of ibuprofen. In order to achieve this aim, the physicochemical properties of ibuprofen had to be evaluated. The aqueous solubility, pH-solubility profile, octanol-water partition coefficient (log P-value) and octanol-buffer distribution coefficient (log D-values, pH 5 and 7. 4) of ibuprofen were determined. According to Naik et al., (2000 : 319) the ideal aqueous solubility of APIs for transdermal delivery should be more than 1 mg. ml- 1. However, results showed that ibuprofen depicted an aqueous solubility of 0. 096 mg. ml- 1 ± 25. 483, which indicated poor water solubility and would therefore be rendered less favourable for transdermal delivery if only considering the aqueous solubility. The pH-solubility profile depicted that ibuprofen was less soluble at low pH-values and more soluble at higher pH-values. Previous research indicated that the ideal log Pvalues for transdermal API permeation of non steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are between 2 and 3 (Swart et al., 2005 : 72). Results obtained during this study indicated a log P-value of 4. 238 for ibuprofen. This value was not included in the ideal range, which is an indication that the lipophilic/hydrophilic properties are not ideal, and this might therefore; contribute to poor ibuprofen penetration through the skin. Furthermore, the obtained log D-values at pH 5 and 7. 4 were 3. 105 and 0. 386, respectively. Therefore, it would be expected that ibuprofen incorporated into a formulation prepared at a pH of 5 would more readily permeate the skin compared to ibuprofen incorporated into a formulation prepared at a pH of 7. 4. A gel, an emulgel and a Pheroid™ emulgel were formulated at pH 5 and 7. 4, in order to examine which dosage form formulated at which pH would deliver enhanced transdermal delivery. Obtained diffusion results of the different semi-solid formulations were furthermore compared to a South African marketed commercial product (Nurofen® gel) in order to establish if a comparable formulation could be obtained. An artificial membrane was used to conduct the membrane permeation studies over a period of 6 h, in order to determine whether ibuprofen was in fact released from the formulations through the membrane. Skin permeation studies were conducted using Franz diffusion cells over a period of 12 h where samples were withdrawn at specified time intervals. All the formulations exhibited an increase in the average cumulative amount of ibuprofen released from the formulations and that permeated the membrane when compared to Nurofen® gel. This increase was statistically significant (p >>> Pheroid™ emulgel (pH 7. 4) > Emulgel (pH 7. 4) >>> Gel (pH 5) > Pheroid™ emulgel (pH 5) ≈ Emulgel (pH 5) > Nurofen® gel. On the other hand, all the formulations exhibited an increase in the average cumulative amount of ibuprofen that permeated the skin when compared to Nurofen® gel. This increase was statistically significant (p > Pheroid™ emulgel (pH 5) > Gel (pH 5) > Emulgel (pH 7. 4) > Pheroid™ emulgel (pH 7. 4) ≈ Emulgel (pH 7. 4) >> Nurofen® gel > Gel (pH 7. 4). From this rank order it was clear that a trend was followed where the pH of formulation also played a role in ibuprofen permeation. All the formulations exhibited a higher release rate and flux when compared to Nurofen® gel. This was statistically significant for the emulgel, gel and Pheroid™ emulgel at pH 7. 4. The gel at pH 7. 4 exhibited the highest release rate and flux. This was observed for the membrane and skin permeation studies. All the formulations (including Nurofen® gel) presented a correlation coefficient (r 2) of 0. 972 – 0. 995 for membrane permeation studies, and 0. 950 – 0. 978 for skin permeation studies; indicating that the release of ibuprofen from each of the formulations could be described by the Higuchi model. Furthermore, all the formulations exhibited a prolonged lag time compared to Nurofen® gel which indicated that the ibuprofen was retained for a longer time by the base. This was statistically significant (p 0. 286). This was observed for the membrane and skin permeation studies. Nurofen® gel exhibited the highest ibuprofen concentration in the stratum corneum as well as in the epidermis followed by the gel at pH 7. 4. However, results obtained for all the formulations indicated that topical as well as transdermal delivery of ibuprofen was achieved. The pH of a formulation plays an important role with respect to API permeation. Ibuprofen is reported to have a pKa value 4. 4 (Dollery, 1999 :I 1); and by application of the Henderson-Hasselbach equation, at pH 5, 20. 08 % of ibuprofen will be present in its unionised form and at pH 7. 4, 0. 1 % ibuprofen will exist in its unionised form. Since the unionised form of APIs is more lipid soluble than the ionised form, unionised forms of APIs permeate more readily across the lipid membranes (Surber & Smith, 2000 : 27). Therefore, it would be expected that ibuprofen formulated at pH 5 would be more permeable than formulations at pH 7. 4. However, this did not correspond to the results (membrane studies) obtained in this study. It may be attributed to the solubility of ibuprofen in the different formulations. According to the pH-solubility profile of ibuprofen obtained in this study, it was more soluble at pH 7. 4 than at pH 5. This was due to the fact that ibuprofen is a weak acidic compound, and for every 3 units away from the <b>pKa-value,</b> the solubility changes 10 -fold (Mahato, 2007 : 14). However, with regard to the skin permeation studies, enhanced permeation was obtained with the formulations prepared at pH 5. This was in accordance with Corrigan et al., (2003 : 148) who stated that NSAIDs are less soluble and more permeable at low pH values, and more soluble and less permeable at high pH values. This was most probably due to the fact that unionised species, although possessing a lower aqueous solubility than the ionised species, resulted in enhanced skin permeation due to being more lipid-soluble. Finally, stability tests on the different semi-solid formulations for a period of three months at different temperature and humidity conditions were conducted to determine product stability. The formulations were stored at 25 °C/ 60 % RH (relative humidity), 30 °C/ 60 % RH and 40 °C/ 75 % RH. Stability tests included: mass variation, pH, zeta potential, droplet size, visual appearance, assay, and viscosity. No significant change was observed for mass variation, pH, zeta potential and droplet size over the three months for any of the different formulations stored at the different storage conditions. In addition, no significant change in colour was observed for the gel and emulgel formulations at pH 5 and 7. 4 over the three months at all the storage conditions. However, it was observed that the formulations containing Pheroid™ showed a drastic change in colour at all the storage conditions. This might have been due to oxidation of certain components present in the Pheroid™ system. Consequently, further investigation is necessary to find the cause of the discolouration and a method to prevent it. The gel formulated at pH 5 depicted the formation of crystals. This might have been due to the fact that the solubility of ibuprofen was exceeded, leading to it precipitating from the formulation. A possible contributing factor to the varying assay values obtained during the study might have been due to non-homogenous sample withdrawal. On the other hand, no significant change was observed for the emulgel and Pheroid™ emulgel formulated at pH 5 and 7. 4. The emulgel and Pheroid™ emulgel formulated at pH 5 depicted relative instability (according to the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements For Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, ICH) only at 40 °C/ 75 % RH with a change in ibuprofen content of more than 5 % (6. 78 and 6. 46 %, respectively). The gel, emulgel and Pheroid™ emulgel at pH 7. 4 exhibited the least variation in ibuprofen concentration at all of the storage conditions. This might indicate that the pH at which a semi-solid formulation is produced will have a direct influence on the stability of the product. No significant changes in viscosity (%RSD 5) with a decrease in viscosity being more pronounced at the higher temperature and humidity storage conditions. A possible contributing factor to the change in viscosity over three months at the specified storage conditions might have been due to the use of Pluronic® F- 127 (viscosity enhancer). This viscosity enhancer possesses a melting point of approximately 56 °C (BAST Corporation. s. a). The problem with this might have been the temperature (70 °C) at which the formulations were prepared. The higher preparation temperature might have caused the Pluronic® F- 127 to degrade, thereby losing its ability to function appropriately. A balance must be maintained between optimum solubility and maximum stability (Pefile & Smith, 1997 : 148). Despite the lower skin permeation of the gel formulated at pH 7. 4, this formulation performed the best, as it was considered stable (least variation during the 3 month stability test) and the obtained tape stripping results showed that this formulation depicted the highest ibuprofen concentrations in the stratum corneum and epidermis. Thus, topical as well as transdermal delivery were obtained. Master...|$|E

Der Schlüssel zur technologischen Anwendung solcher Supramoleküle liegt in ihrer reversiblen Schaltbarkeit. Cycloheptatrieneinheiten an Calixarenen oder Rotaxanen sind solche potentiellen Schalter. Durch die Oxidation der Cycloheptatrieneinheiten an Calixarenen und Rotaxanen in die korrespondierenden Tropyliumderivate wechseln Donatoreigenschaften des Supramoleküls zu ausgeprägten Akzeptoreigenschaften. Supramolekulare Strukturen konnten mit diesen Tropyliumderivaten und einem makrozyklischen Polyether aufgebaut werden. Darüberhinaus ließen sich Supramoleküle auch unter Verwendung von Cycloheptatrienderivaten und verschiedenen Ammonium-, Iminium- und Tropyliumsalzen generieren. Die supramolekularen Wechselwirkungen der entsprechenden Wirt-Gast-Komplexe wurden mittels NMR-Titration untersucht. FAB-MS-Messungen bestätigen 1 : 1 -Komplexe. In Gegenwart von Wasserstoffbrückenakzeptoren zeigen die Tropyliumderivate der Calixarene außerdem einen starken bathochromen Shift und eine drastische Verschiebung des pKa-Wertes durch die Ausbildung eines chinoiden Systems. Supramolecules {{incorporating}} cycloheptatrien {{building blocks}} represent potential switchable components of host-guest-complexes and rotaxanes, respectively. Both a macrocycle based on calixarene and a molecular thread containing arylcycloheptatrien units were synthesized. A change of properties of these macrocycles may take place by oxidation of the cycloheptatrienyl building blocks forming their corresponding tropylium salts. The cycloheptatrienyl unit has donor properties while tropylium salts are strong electron acceptors. A pseudorotaxane was {{formed as a}} supramolecular assembly with different tropylium units in a molecular wire using polyethers. Another kind of supramolecular assembly with cycloheptratrienyl derivatives of calixarenes as host with different ammonia-, iminium-, and tropylium salts as guests was studied. With the help of NMR-titration experiments the interaction of these host-guest-complexes were examined. Investigations with FAB-MS supported an 1 : 1 - stoichiometry of the formed complexes. In the presence of hydrogen bond acceptors the tropylium derivatives of calixarenes exhibited strong bathochromic shifts by building up a quinoid structure in the system. The <b>pka-values</b> of the tropylium derivatives were decreased drastically compared with the unsubstituted calixarenes...|$|R
40|$|Der Vergleich von Myxochelin A und Methyl Myxochelin A, welcher im Zentrum dieser Arbeit steht, zeigte Unterschiede und Gemeinsamkeiten in Bezug auf die Säurekonstanten und Stabilitätskonstanten der Fe 3 + Komplexe und die Art der Fe 3 + Komplexe auf. Die mittels Potentiometrie bestimmten pKS Werte wurden durch 1 H NMR Titrationen den Hydroxyfunktionen zugeordnet; bei beiden Verbindungen finden die ersten Deprotonierungen in ortho Position statt. Die Hydroxyfunktionen der Aromaten des Methyl-Derivates wiesen, anders als Myxochelin A, eine unterschiedliche Acidität auf. Die sehr ähnlichen Bruttostabilitätskonstanten der Fe 3 + Komplexe wurden durch diskontinuierliche spektrophotometrische Titrationen bestimmt. Der von Myxochelin A, im Gegensatz zum Methyl Derivat, gebildete MLH 4 Komplex macht den Liganden, besonders durch die zweifache Bindung an die Phenolat-Sauerstoffe, zum besseren Fe 3 + Chelator. Desweiteren wurde die Auflösung von Ferrihydrit bei pH= 5, 3 und pH= 6, 1 untersucht. Das Methyl Derivat löste 91 % respektive 85 % des von Myxochelin A gelösten Fe 3 +. Neben diesen Liganden wurden die Säurekonstanten und die log(b) -Werte der Fe 3 + Komplexe von 2 -Hydroxybenzoesäureamid, 2, 3 -Dihydroxybenzoesäureamid und Didesoxy Myxochelin A bestimmt. Ebenfalls wurde das Lösungsverhalten dieser Liganden über Ferrihydrit untersucht. Die log(b) -Werte der Mg 2 + und Ca 2 + Komplexe konnten für Myxochelin A und Didesoxy Myxochelin A bestimmt werden und waren deutlich kleiner als die der Fe 3 + Komplexe. The {{main focus}} of this {{dissertation}} was to compare Myxochelin A and its methyl-derivative. The <b>pKa-values</b> of the hydroxyl groups of both molecules were determined by potentiometric titrations; and assigned by 1 H-NMR-measerments. This measerments showed as well that ortho-hydroxygroups of the methyl-derivative have, in contrast to Myxochelin A, a different acidity. The first three constants of the Fe 3 +-complexes, which were collected by discontinuously spectrophotometric measurements, are quite similar to each other. Yet, formation of a MLH- 4 -species, with the same configuration as Myxochelin A, is impossible for the methyl-derivative. It was shown that these species {{is very important for}} Myxochelin A, because of its twofold bidentate coordination to the phenoxo oxygen atoms. This renders Myxochelin A the better Fe 3 +-chelator. Further dissolving of ferrihydrite was examined with both ligands at different pH-values. The methyl-derivative dissolved a smaller amount of Fe 3 + than Myxochelin A (91 % (pH= 5. 3) and 85 % (pH= 6. 1)). Acidity and complexation constants of Fe 3 + were also determined for: 2 Hydroxybenzamid, 2, 3 -Dihydroxybenzamid and Didesoxy Myxochelin A. Their ability to make iron soluble by complexation was examined with solutions of these ligands and hardly soluble ferrihydrite. Constants of Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + complexes were collected by potentiometric titrations for the ligands Myxochelin A and Didesoxy Myxochelin A...|$|R
40|$|The {{reactions}} of 3 -dimethylamino- 2, 2 -dimethylH- 2 -azirine (1) with phenols {{are described in}} chap. 1. The azirine 1 reacts with the 2 -formyl- and 2 -acetylphenols 5 - 8 to yield the N’-methylidene derivatives of 2 -amino-N,N-dimethyl-isobutyramide 9 - 12 (Scheme 2, tautomeric form b). These products are in equilibrium with the tautomeric quinoide forms 9 a- 12 a. Under similar conditions 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde did not react with 1. Reaction of 1 with 4 -hydroxycoumarine (13) gives the 4 -aminocoumarine 14 (Scheme 2). The mechanism of these reactions {{is analogous to the}} previously reported one for the reaction of 1 with cyclic enolisable 1, 3 -diketones [2][3]. Activated phenols with <b>pKa-values</b> < 8, e. g. 2 - and 4 -nitrophenol, 2, 4 -dinitrophenol and pentachlorophenol, undergo addition reactions with 1 in boiling benzene solution to give the aniline derivatives 15 - 18 (Scheme 3). A reaction mechanism is given in Scheme 3 : after protonation of the azirine 1 followed by attack of the phenolate ion at the amidinium-C-atom, the intermediate of type e undergoes a rearrangement to the spiro-Meisenheimer complexes of type f. Ring opening leads to 15 - 18. A similar reaction is observed for 2, 4 -dinitro-thiophenol and 1, giving 2 -(N’-(2, 4 -dinitrophenyl) amino) -N,N-dimethyl-isobutyrothioamide (19). The azirine 1 reacts with the more acidic 2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenol (picric acid) to yield 3, 3, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperazine- 2, 5 -bis(N,N-dimethyliminium) dipicrate (21, Scheme 4). The methacrylamidinium salt 22 is the only product (97 % yield) in the reaction of 8 -hydroxy- 5, 7 -dinitroquinoline and 1 in acetonitrile solution. The reaction of 1 with picric acid can be explained in a similar way as the previously reported one with strong acids (cf. Scheme I, [1][3][5]). An alternative mechanism without formation of the 1 -aza-allylcation c is postulated in Scheme 5, together with a mechanism which could explain the exclusive formation of 22 in the reaction of 1 with 8 -hydroxy- 5, 7 -dinitroquinoline. In chap. 2 a few {{reactions of}} the azirine 1 with aryl halides are reported. In the reaction with 2, 4 -dinitrofluorobenzene it is shown by UV. and NMR., that m,n and o are intermediates (Scheme 6). Working up the reaction mixture with water, hydrogen sulfide or benzylamine leads to the aniline derivatives 17, 19 and 26, respectively. With picryl chloride and 8 -hydroxy- 5, 7 -dinitroquinoline the azirine 1 undergoes a nucleophilic aromatic substitution to afford the intermediates p and q, which via deprotonation and ring opening give acrylamidine derivatives (27 and 29, Scheme 7 and 8). The steric hindrance in p and q between the aziridine ring and the two groups in o-position could be the reason for the different behaviour of the intermediates n and p or q (cf. Schemes 6 and 8) ...|$|R
40|$|Chitin is {{a linear}} {{biopolymer}} composed of 2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy-D-glucopyranose (N -acetylglucosamine or GlcNAc, A-unit) linked by ß – (1 - 4) glycosidic linkages. Chitin occurs as a structural polysaccharide in animals with an outer skeleton (Arthropoda), {{and in the}} cell wall of certain fungi. In the cuticle of crustaceans and insects, chitin exists in close association with proteins, minerals and pigments. In Vietnam, a country endowed with favorable conditions for aquaculture, the annual shrimp production from aquaculture is approximately 450 000 metric tons (2010), and one third of this is byproducts, including head and shell. The two major species are white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) and black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon). These shrimp by-products are a large resource not only for chitin but also for other valuable components as proteins and pigments. The chemical composition of heads and shells of the black tiger and the white shrimp was analysed. The amounts of the three main components, i. e. proteins, chitin, and minerals, {{were found to be}} similar in the by-products from the two shrimp species. The protein contents of the heads were 44. 39 ± 0. 50 % and 48. 56 ± 1. 33 % of the dry weight in the white shrimp and black tiger shrimp, respectively, which were about 50 % higher than in the shells. In the shells, the chitin content were 27. 37 ± 1. 82 % and 29. 29 ± 1. 78 % of the dry weight in the white shrimp and black tiger shrimp, respectively, which were more than 2. 5 times higher than in the heads. These large differences in the chemical composition of the heads and the shells had consequences for the optimal extraction conditions in order to isolate a pure and high molecular weight chitin from isolated heads and shells. The amino acid composition of the proteins were similar for the two species, both for heads and shells, and with a profile that was suitable as a source for fish feed. Chitin is insoluble in aqueous solvents, which limits its applications. However, by partly removing chitin’s acetyl groups and thereby introducing amino groups that can be protonated and positively charged (D -units), the water-soluble polysaccharide chitosan can be prepared. This is performed by chemical de-N-acetylation of chitin at highly alkaline conditions and high temperature. The de-N-acetylation reaction was studied in detail with the chitin disaccharide (GlcNAc-GlcNAc or AA) as a model substrate. The resonances in 1 H NMR spectrum of the chitin disaccharide in 2. 77 M NaOD were assigned. The ß-anomeric protons of the four different disaccharides, i. e. AA, DD, AD, and DA, are well separated and can be monitored during the de- N -acetylation. Thus, the rate of de-N-acetylation of the reducing end was found to be twice the rate of the nonreducing ends. The total rate of de- N -acetylation of chitin disaccharide was for the first time determined to be second order with respect to sodium hydroxide concentration. This contributes to explain the differences between the homogeneous and heterogeneous de- N -acetylation reaction. The activation energy for the reaction was determined to 114. 4 and 98. 6 kJ/mol in 2. 77 M and 5. 5 M NaOD, respectively. Hydrogels of biopolymers have attracted much attention for their applications in e. g. tissue engineering, immobilization of cells and controlled drug release. A new gelling system of chitosan – alginate, or their corresponding oligomers, is described. The gelling system was studied by combining either poly-mannuronate and chitosan oligomers, or polymeric chitosan and mannuronate oligomers. The two components were mixed at a pH well above the <b>pKa-values</b> of the amino-groups, where the chitosan/chitosan oligomers are almost uncharged, allowing mixing with the negatively charged poly-mannuronate/mannuronate oligomers without the precipitation that would otherwise occur upon mixing a polyanion with a polycation. Then the pH was lowered by adding D-glucono-δ-lactone (GDL), a proton donating substance with the ability to release protons in a controlled way, so that the amino groups of chitosan/chitosan oligomers were protonated and thereby positively charged, resulting in the formation of a hydrogel. The neutral-solubility of the polymeric chitosan is achieved by selecting a polymeric chitosan with a degree of acetylation of 40 %, while the neutral-solubility of the (fully de-N-acetylated) chitosan oligomers is obtained by selecting oligomers with a chain length below 10. The kinetics of gelation was fast in both gelling systems, with a sol-gel transition within the time for the first measurements. Initial rates of gelation and gel strengths (measured as storage modulus, G’) increased with increasing concentration of oligomers. The gel strength (G’) of both gelling systems increased with increasing GDL concentration (and thereby the final pH of the gel) from neutral pH down to pH 4, and decreased with increasing ionic strength, indicating that ionic hydrogels are formed. The importance of the nearly perfect match in distance between the negative charges {{on the same side of}} poly-mannuronate/mannuronate oligomers and the positive charges on the same side of chitosan/chitosan oligomers is crucial for these gelling systems, as demonstrated by the very different gel strengths of two alginates with extreme composition, i. e. a poly-mannuronate and a poly-guluronate, where poly-mannuronate formed relatively strong gels with chitosan oligomers while poly-guluronate formed gels of very limited mechanical strength.
