50|$|The {{larval stage}} of some Thaumetopoeidae {{are known as}} processionary caterpillars, so named because they move in columns in search of food, {{resembling}} a procession. Some of the species, like the <b>pine</b> and oak <b>processionaries,</b> can constitute a health hazard.|$|R
50|$|Fabre {{conducted}} a famous {{study on the}} <b>processionary</b> <b>pine</b> larvae {{where a group of}} them were attached nose-to-tail in a circle with food just outside the circle; they continued marching in the circle for a week; he described the experiment in his 1916 book The Life of the Caterpillar. The caterpillars may follow a trail of pheromones or silk, but the main stimuli that induce following are from the hairs (setae) {{on the end of the}} abdomen of the caterpillar in front. The ant mill is a similar phenomenon.|$|R
40|$|Context[br/] Forests are {{important}} carbon sinks, but increasing temperatures may favour increases in insect populations, resulting in greater damage to trees. This, in turn, {{would lead to}} lower levels of carbon sequestration, intensifying global warming. [br/] [br/] • Aim[br/] It is therefore important to predict the impact of insect defoliation on tree growth accurately. The main insect defoliators of conifers in Southern Europe and North Africa are <b>pine</b> and cedar <b>processionary</b> moths (Lepidoptera, Thaumetopoeidae). [br/] [br/] • Method[br/] We conducted a meta-analysis based on 45 study cases, to estimate the effect of processionary moth defoliation on tree growth. [br/] [br/] • Result[br/] Overall, processionary moth defoliation {{had a significant impact}} on tree growth, regardless of the tree and moth species considered. Mean relative tree growth loss increased with the rate of defoliation levelling out at ca. 50 %; it was significantly larger for young than for old trees. [br/] [br/] • Conclusion[br/] These results suggest that estimates of processionary moth defoliation could easily be incorporated into tree growth models, to predict the effect of processionary moth outbreaks on carbon sequestration in Mediterranean forests...|$|R

40|$|Purpose To {{report on}} a child {{presenting}} with iritis and angle closure glaucoma caused by caterpillar hairs. Methods A 12 -year-old girl complained of sudden pain and visual loss in her left eye while she was playing in a pinewood. Two hours later, she developed maculo-papular rash on her limbs. On examination, left visual acuity was 1 / 10. The affected eye showed conjunctival hyperemia, corneal edema, anterior chamber flare (4 + cells). Corneal staining with fluorescein disclosed diffuse superficial punctate keratopathy. Left IOP was 55 mm Hg. Visante OCT of the affected eye showed a thin, translucent, linear foreign body into the cornea and anterior chamber up to the irido-corneal angle. Topical steroids, antibiotics, cycloplegics, hypotensive eyedrops, and intravenous mannitol were given. Results Inspection of {{the place where the}} girl was playing revealed the presence of numerous <b>processionary</b> <b>pine</b> caterpillars. On the basis of this finding and the clinical data, a diagnosis of iritis and angle closure glaucoma caused by caterpillar hairs was made. After 3 days’ treatment, corneal edema and anterior chamber inflammation resolved, IOP returned to normal, and visual acuity was 10 / 10 again. However, a small iris cyst was still visible on OCT scans. Conclusion Ocular lesions caused by caterpillar hairs are uncommon. Ophthalmologists should be aware that intense iritis with angle closure glaucoma {{may be the result of}} the penetration of caterpillar hairs into the eye. OCT scans may be important to confirm the diagnosis. </br...|$|R

50|$|Efforts {{to control}} the <b>pine</b> <b>processionary</b> have {{included}} biological control using Bacillus thuringiensis, which is effective on eggs and first or second stage caterpillars (in September or October), or insecticides such as diflubenzuron, an insect growth regulator, which can be sprayed from aircraft. Monitoring can {{include the use of}} pheromone traps. Older methods used insecticides in oil, inserted directly into nests, or mechanical removal of nests.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} epidemics, {{such as the}} scabies that {{decimated}} the population of Spanish Ibex in the 1990s,or the local Austropotamobius pallipes crayfish that became virtually extinct due to a fungus that spread after the introduction of North American crayfish.Equally, plant species have suffered epidemics that have damaged the health of extensive forest areas, such as the <b>Pine</b> <b>Processionary</b> (Thaumetopoea pityocampa), a moth that does major damage to conifers.|$|E
5000|$|Trees: {{the most}} common tree in the region's forests is Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis). These are plagued by a moth known as the <b>pine</b> <b>processionary</b> (Thaumetopoea pityocampa). A special brigade targets this moth, setting traps and {{destroying}} their nests. In {{the northern part of}} the province, although in lesser measure, there is holm oak (Quercus ilex), white poplar (Populus alba), narrow-leafed ash (Fraxinus angustifolia), and strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.).|$|E
50|$|T. pityocampa is {{a highly}} social organism. Throughout its life cycle, a <b>pine</b> <b>processionary</b> will make several shelters. The first of these are flimsy and temporary, but in the third instar, they build a {{permanent}} nest. Once their permanent nest is built, the caterpillars become foragers staying {{in the vicinity of}} the nest. The nest has no openings, so caterpillars force themselves through the layers of the shelter. The waste from the larvae's diet accumulates at the bottom of the nest.|$|E
50|$|Towards the end {{of their}} larval development, <b>pine</b> <b>processionary</b> {{caterpillars}} are highly irritating to the skin. Contact with the hairs of the caterpillar can cause severe rashes (urticaria) and eye irritation. Some individuals may have an allergic reaction to the caterpillar's hairs. 5th stage larvae can eject hairs when threatened or stressed; the hairs, which have the form of harpoons, then penetrate and irritate all areas of exposed skin nearby with an urticating protein. Allergic reactions may follow in susceptible individuals on subsequent exposure to the hairs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pine</b> <b>processionary</b> (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) is a moth of {{the family}} Thaumetopoeidae. Sometimes placed in the genus Traumatocampa, {{it is one of}} the most {{destructive}} species to pines and cedars in Central Asia, North Africa and the countries of southern Europe. The urticating hairs of the caterpillar larvae cause harmful reactions in humans and other mammals. The species is notable for the behaviour of its caterpillars, which overwinter in tent-like nests high in pine trees, and which proceed through the woods in nose-to-tail columns, protected by their severely irritating hairs, as described by the French entomologist Jean-Henri Fabre.|$|E
50|$|The diverse {{forms of}} postglacial relief {{serve as a}} shelter for plenty of animal species. The park is the habitat of a stag beetle. During June and July {{one can see the}} beetles in the near of oaks. Other insects are a European <b>pine</b> <b>processionary</b> and a moaning cloak - the biggest {{butterfly}} in Poland.A lot of places reveal the trace of beavers, which were introduced to the park in 1986. In the same places otters are found. Another mammals characteristic for the park are red and roe deer, a red fox, a wild boar, a raccoon dog, a European polecat, a beech marten and a European badger.|$|E
50|$|Though most <b>pine</b> <b>processionary</b> moths {{only live}} one year, some in high altitudes or more {{northern}} areas may survive {{for over two}} years. The adult moths lay their eggs near the tops of pine trees. After hatching, the larva eat pine needles while progressing through five stages of development. In order to maintain beneficial living conditions, silken nests are built over the winter. Around the beginning of April, the caterpillars leave the nests in the procession for which the species is known. They burrow underground and emerge {{at the end of}} summer. High numbers of adults are produced in years with a warm spring.|$|E
5000|$|Some caterpillars, {{like the}} tomato hornworm and tobacco hornworm, have long [...] "whip-like" [...] organs {{attached}} {{to the ends of}} their body. The caterpillar wiggles these organs to frighten away flies and predatory wasps. Some caterpillars can evade predators by using a silk line and dropping off from branches when disturbed. Many species thrash about violently when disturbed to scare away potential predators. One species (Amorpha juglandis) even makes high pitched whistles that can scare away birds. <b>Pine</b> <b>processionary</b> (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) caterpillars often link into a long train to move through trees and over the ground. The head of the lead caterpillar is visible, but the other heads can appear hidden.|$|E
50|$|In {{the absence}} of a radiant heat source, the body {{temperature}} of aggregated social caterpillars may be several degrees Celsius above ambient temperature. This phenomenon was first reported in 1938 in Vanessa caterpillars. Subsequently, other studies showed that the shelter of the <b>pine</b> <b>processionary</b> caterpillar Thaumetopoea pityocampa rose 2 to 3 °C when occupied by the caterpillars and cooled down when they left the structure to feed. Studies of the social caterpillars of Eriogaster lanestris showed that the internal temperature of the nest exceed ambient temperature by as much as 6.7 °C, though the average temperature gains of 2 to 3 °C were in line with those reported for other species. These thermal gains reported for these species appear attributable to the trapping of the metabolic heat generated by the caterpillars as they process food.|$|E
50|$|Situated on {{the road}} from the Adriatic to Kosovo, the town {{developed}} during the 4th-2nd centuries B.C. In ancient times, it was known as Picarea. The ancient town was destroyed by a barbarian invasion. The town has also been known as Pezhve. This area has a 2,000-year-old tradition of resin sculpture. The remains of this tradition are located in a quarter of Pukë town. In the 20th century, Pukë was expanded as a military base and a centre of Catholic Education. The distinguished Albanian poet Migjeni worked there from 1936 to 1937. The school where he worked as a teacher is a tourist attraction. The town is surrounded by a 400-hectare massif covered with pine trees.

40|$|Variations of {{phenology}} {{and distribution}} have been recently highlighted in numerous insect species and attributed to climate change, particularly {{the increase of}} temperature and atmospheric CO 2. Both {{have been shown to}} have direct and indirect effects on insect species of various ecosystems, though the responses are often species-specific. The <b>pine</b> <b>processionary</b> moth, Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Lepidoptera, Notodontidae) is an important pest of conifers in the Mediterranean region, and has been recently shown to expand its altitudinal range in the Alps, including the mountain pine Pinus mugo as a novel host. We had the opportunity to transplant colonies of the <b>pine</b> <b>processionary</b> moth to a high elevation site well outside of the current range of the insect (Stillberg, Davos, Switzerland, 2180 m), where trees of the mountain pine have been grown for five years under ambient and elevated CO 2 concentrations (ca. 570 ppm). The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the response of first instar larvae to extreme conditions of temperature and to an altered performance induced by the change of host metabolism under elevated CO 2. Larval mortality and relative growth rate did not differ between host trees grown in ambient or elevated CO 2. As extended snow cover may be an important mortality factor of larval colonies on the dwarf trees of mountain pine, we tested the survival of colonies transplanted at two extreme sites of Eastern Alps. The snow cover extended over more than one month proved to be an important mortality factor of larval colonies on mountain pine. We concluded that the first instar larvae of the <b>pine</b> <b>processionary</b> moth are not concerned by unusually low temperature and CO 2 increase whereas they can be later strongly affected by snow accumulation. The decrease of snow cover observed in the last decades, however, may reduce such a risk...|$|E
40|$|Background. <b>Pine</b> <b>processionary</b> larvae produce urticating hairs (setae) {{that serve}} for {{protection}} against predators. Setae induce cutaneous reactions in animals and humans. The presence of toxic or allergic mechanisms {{is a matter}} of debate. Objectives. To detect the presence of allergens in setae and to characterize them. Materials and methods. Setae extracts were characterized by gel staining and immunoblot, with sera from patients with immediate reactions and positive prick test reactions, as well as a rabbit antiserum raised against setae. Setae proteins were fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography. The most relevant allergen was analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS), and its sequence was deduced from an expressed sequence tag bank. Results. Setae contained at least seven different allergens. The most intense detection corresponded to a protein of MW ∼ 14 000 that was similar to thaumetopoein, a previously described protein with mast cell-degranulating properties. MALDI-MS-based de novo sequencing provided a partial amino acid sequence {{different from that of the}} previously described allergen Tha p 1, and it was named Tha p 2. This allergen was detected in 61 % of patients, and it is therefore a new major caterpillar allergen. Conclusions.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>pine</b> <b>processionary</b> moth (PPM, Thaumetopoea pityocampa) is {{the main}} {{defoliator}} of pines in the Mediterranean area, necessitating constant surveillance and regular pest management. A sound understanding of the spatial distribution of infested trees, both within and between stands, is required to increase management efficiency. We hypothesized that both host tree density at stand scale and tree apparency at individual tree scale were responsible for between- and within-stand patterns of PPM infestation. We tested these hypotheses on a sample of 171 maritime pine stands in the Landes de Gascogne, the largest plantation forest in Europe. We showed that PPM infestation (percentage of infested trees) decreased significantly with stand density, and was therefore greater in older than in younger stands. The probability of a pine tree being attacked increased significantly with tree height and proximity {{to the edge of}} the stand. Mortality rates of exposed sentinel egg batches did not differ with distance from the stand edge. We discuss three likely explanations for higher infestation of taller trees at stand edges: better survival of larvae on sun-exposed trees, and random interception vs. active host selection by gravid females. Our findings suggest that stand management could be adapted in order to decrease the risk of damage by the <b>pine</b> <b>processionary</b> moth, and that predictive tools for infestation dynamics can be based on forest growth models...|$|E
