40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is written}} for both Belgian and foreign readers alike and compiles six studies that {{all contribute to}} {{a deeper understanding of}} the extent to which the Belgian pension system is adequate. Belgian readers, possibly already up to date with what has been written so far and interested in Belgian pension provision for its own sake, will come to realise that much can be learned by delving deeper into Belgian <b>pension</b> <b>adequacy</b> than was previously done. In what follows, and especially in studies 1 and 2, they will find an extensive and detailed overview of how pensions are calculated and how fiscal regulations impact these calculations. Clearly, many readers will find a focus on calculation details pointless if they have no empirical relevance. For that reason, we use previously unexplored administrative data sources to show how these details differentially impact individuals with distinct background characteristics. Together, this focus on calculation details and previously unexplored empirical facts alters common knowledge on who gets what and why in Belgium. To foreign readers, interested in their own pension system, or in the various ways in which other countries organize social protection in old age, we will show that studying <b>pension</b> <b>adequacy</b> using the Belgian case, is as revealing as using any other country. While there is absolutely no chance that the way pensions are currently organized in Belgium will serve as a blueprint for other countries, some of the insights developed in this dissertation can be applied to the study of other pension systems. Foreign readers will especially benefit from studies 3 to 6 that are modified versions of articles published in journals directed at social policy scholars (respectively Journal of Social Policy, Social Indicators Research, Journal of European Social Policy, and, Ageing and Society). Studies 3 and 6 use the Belgian case to illustrate specific approaches to studying <b>pension</b> <b>adequacy</b> (the flexicurity approach in study 3; the lifecourse approach in study 6). Studies 4 and 5 use our knowledge of the Belgian pension system to show that the assumptions underlying the construction of internationally used <b>pension</b> <b>adequacy</b> indicators are not mere details, the study of which can be skipped at will. While all six studies share a common focus on Belgian <b>pension</b> <b>adequacy,</b> they were all written for very specific research purposes and hence, ultimately, remain somewhat distinctive. To foster more unity across the various studies, the introduction and the conclusion situate the various studies in the broader research tradition on pension adequacy: this dissertation is not the first one to investigate (Belgian) <b>pension</b> <b>adequacy</b> and much excellent research has already been carried out on the subject. The introduction summarizes the insights generated by this previous research and points out how our own research adds to what we already know. The conclusion integrates previous research and our own studies to summarize what we know and do not know about the adequacy of the Belgian pension system. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Though {{the main}} {{benchmark}} {{used to assess}} pension reforms {{continues to be the}} expected resulting fall in future government spending, the impact of policy changes on <b>pension</b> <b>adequacy</b> is increasingly coming to the fore. As yet, there {{does not seem to be}} a broad consensus in policymaking circles and academic literature on what constitutes the best measure of <b>pension</b> <b>adequacy.</b> While various indicators have been developed and utilised, no single measure appears to offer a clear indication of the extent to which reforms will impact on the achievement of pension system goals. Many indicators appear ill-suited to study the effective impact of reforms, particularly those that change the nature of the pension system from defined benefit to defined contribution. Existing measures are frequently hard to interpret as they do not have an underlying benchmark which allows their current or projected value to be assessed as adequate or inadequate. Currently used <b>pension</b> <b>adequacy</b> indicators tend to be point-in-time measures which ignore the impact of benefit indexation rules. They also are unaffected by very important factors, such as changes in the pension age and in life expectancy. This tends to make existing indicators minimise the impact of systemic reforms on the poverty alleviation and income replacement functions of pension systems. The emphasis on assumptions which are very unrepresentative of real-life labour market conditions also makes current indicators deceptive, particularly in relation to outcomes for women and those on low incomes. This paper posits that these defects can be remedied by using adequacy indicators based on estimates of pension wealth (i. e. the total projected flow of pension benefits through retirement) calculated using more realistic labour market assumptions. These measures are used to give a better indication of the effective impact of pension reforms enacted since the 1990 s in ten major European countries. They suggest that these reforms have decreased generosity significantly, but that the poverty alleviation function remains strong in those countries where minimum pensions were improved. However, moves to link benefits to contributions have raised clear adequacy concerns for women and for those on low incomes which policymakers should consider and tackle. ...|$|E
40|$|A major {{strategy}} of recent pension reforms {{has been to}} promote what may be called the «working longer» policy paradigm arguing that working longer represents a win‐win strategy by addressing both the challenge of pension finance sustainability and adequacy. By working longer this extends the contribution period for pensions and reduces the period of pension payments and so helps to balance income and outlays for <b>pensions.</b> <b>Adequacy</b> and social sustainability is improved by increasing the individual earnings basis for future pension benefits and a shorter period in retirement brings higher yearly benefits. The policy measures to bring about these changes are numerous, but {{in this paper we}} will deal with two different ways of bringing the factual pension age upwards, considered to be partial substitutes (OECD, 2011) : The first one is the straightforward solution of rising the normal retirement age (e. g. the UK). The second strategy is more hidden and implicit, and consists of introducing demographic adjustment factors into the system, that via expected behavioural changes will induce potential retirees to postpone their retirement. Norway (and Sweden) introduced a flexible statutory retirement age where a longevity adjustment factor ensures that people get lower pension benefits if the life expectancy of their cohort increases. A third strategy not considered here relies on a demographic factor that automatically increases the retirement age in correlation with population ageing (e. g. Denmark). This paper aims at exploring the pension reform processes in two countries and answer why countries embark on different paths toward extended working life. We also raise some critical issues regarding the consequences the policy design might have for implementation and peoples´ behaviour and adjustment to the new system. We also question the {{strategy of}} automatic stabilizers with respect to information for future pensioners about consequences of different choices and what role street‐level bureaucracies might play in making the implementation of the new pension scheme work according to its intentions, i. e. to make people work longer. Theoretically, we will follow an institutional and ideational perspective. The analysis will rely on policy documents, and interviews made with members of national pension commissions...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} attention given {{in recent months}} to the shortfalls faced by state and local pension funds. Using the current methodology of assessing pension obligations, the shortfalls sum to nearly $ 1 trillion. Some analysts have argued that by using what {{they consider to be}} a more accurate methodology, the shortfalls could be more than three times this size. Based on these projections, many political figures have argued the need to drastically reduce the generosity of public sector pensions, and possibly to default on pension obligations already incurred. This paper shows: 1) Most of the pension shortfall using the current methodology is attributable to the plunge in the stock market in the years 2007 - 2009. 2) The argument that pension funds should only assume a risk-free rate of return in assessing <b>pension</b> fund <b>adequacy</b> ignores the distinction between governmental units, which need be little concerned over the timing of market fluctuations, and individual investors, who must be very sensitive to market timing. 3) The size of the projected state and local government shortfalls measured as a share of future gross state products appear manageable. pension funds, pensions...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the economic and}} demographic factors that threaten the viability of European pension systems over the next 50 years. In the short to medium term, the principal challenge is indeed a structural rebalancing of public finances, by applying austerity measures and reducing reliance on debt-financing, {{while at the same}} time promoting jobs growth and minimizing adverse impacts on vulnerable population groups. In the longer term, population aging remains the key challenge, although its magnitude, speed and timing vary across the European countries under review. Longevity gains and falling fertility levels, especially in Central and Eastern European countries where emigration is another contributing factor, imply that the cohorts of elderly are growing in number just as the cohorts of working population supporting them are starting to decline. The implications on the size and shape of public services and finances as well as on future growth and on living standards are considerable. This chapter argues that a review of fundamentals is required, for all concerned – individual countries as well as EU institutions – in moving forward, by examining whether, and how, recent policy reforms compromise the <b>pension</b> income <b>adequacy</b> of future retirees, and what policies can improve the prospects for both th...|$|R

40|$|The {{increased}} {{privatization of}} pensions – {{the shift from}} state to private respon-sibility for old age retirement income – raises fundamental issues of participa-tory stakeholder rights and social inequality. International organizations and national policymakers advocate for a policy shift away from pay-as-you-go (PAYG) financed public pension schemes towards private, mainly prefunded, pensions. This is largely motivated by an economic logic of financial sustain-ability in ageing societies under fiscal austerity and of boosting financial capital markets to create economic growth. Pension reforms {{over the last two}} decades cut back public pension benefits, gradually extended the official retirement age, and fostered privately funded pensions.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{and compares}} the {{development}} and characteristics of the pension systems in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. It uses a policy index to compare the inputs of these four pension systems {{as well as their}} social outputs. The thesis starts by reviewing the ancient Chinese welfare and political ideologies and practices and the Western welfare ideologies and regimes to discover the core values behind the Chinese Community pensions. Four country case studies examine {{the development and}} performance of these state pension schemes {{in the context of the}} family support system and demographic trends. They explore the sustainability of <b>pension</b> provisions, the <b>adequacy</b> of public <b>pensions,</b> personal and private sources of retirement income. The problems of these four pension provisions are thus revealed. The policy index constructed through the radar chart and Surface Measure of Overall Performance (SMOP) approaches is used to compare the performances of these four pension systems on policy inputs and social outputs. The conclusion of the research is that Confucianism and capitalism integrate into a new paternalism through the patriarchal values they share and which dominate the Chinese Community nowadays. But the features of these four pension systems vary due to the different political, historical, economic and social contexts of each state. The findings show that none of these pension provisions can effectively prevent elderly people from poverty in old age. They all rely on personal social security responsibility and the continuation of the family support system. This thesis concludes that all these states lack a needs-based basic pension system to secure retirees’ income level. ...|$|R

40|$|Pensions are {{fundamentally}} methods of addressing and managing {{the risks of}} aging. However, in terms of coverage, the acknowledged difference between the formal and informal sector workers in developing countries {{has led to the}} assumption that people in the formal sector do {{not have to worry about}} pension. Against this background, this thesis investigates the extent to which pension ensures adequate income for retired women civil servants in Nigeria. Understanding these women‘s retirement experiences necessitated an approach that incorporated gendered life course and gendered political economy. Central to a life course approach is the notion that it is difficult to divorce pension and retirement outcomes from the life course experiences that precede them. A gendered political economy approach allows for the de-bunking of the unitary household model and enables the adaptation of Razavi‘s ―care diamond‖ with a focus on retirees‘ financial support for dependants. By using interviews and questionnaires, this thesis analyses the links between and comparisons across pension schemes, educational levels, retirement age, pension entitlements, adequacy and supplements. Cross tabulation is used as a lead to identifying and pursuing potential patterns in dataset and digging deep into the factors that impact women‘s <b>pension</b> <b>adequacy.</b> Despite the limitations of the study, it is apparent that in the context of normative expectations of extended family structure, linked lives, high rate of un/under employment of dependants and limited (and high cost of) access to social provisioning, pension is and will always be inadequate. This then forces formal sector women retirees into the informal sector to supplement their pension income. Findings of the study clearly demonstrate that the sustainable provision of formal sector pensions should not be the end of policy concerns about wellbeing in later life; but the start of a much wider focus on social provision and social relations in later life. This study‘s findings have implications for the pension, ageing and social protection policies in Nigeria, which are applicable to the wider sub Saharan African. The implications of this study for assessing <b>pension</b> <b>adequacy</b> also extend beyond Nigeria...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine and analyze empirically whether the Central and Eastern Europe countries` reformed pension systems are providing adequate and safe pensions. Starting in 1990 s, most Central and Eastern European countries radically reformed their pension systems. The rising optimism initiates many studies where the advantages of the reforms were in the focus. The global financial crisis negatively affects the reformed pension systems. As a response, the policy makers in few of those countries decided to set up different measures: increasing or reducing the pension contribution for alleviating the fiscal deficit or encouraging the employment, adapting the contribution rate and allowing individuals to switch back to the old system. These last changes in the pension systems have triggered the following question: How much and in which way the implementation and experiences gained with the functioning of the reform pension system will have impact in the future <b>pension</b> <b>adequacy</b> and sustainability of the pension system?...|$|E

40|$|Possible future {{trends in}} the {{development}} of <b>pension</b> <b>adequacy</b> are usually simulated using dynamic microsimulation models. These models are very complex and include many different processes. This, and the many individual interactions, makes it difficult to see which procedures and relations underlie the observed simulation results. Hence, the discussion of simulation results, and especially trends, tend to be based on ‘common sense reasoning’ using only a few fundamental parameters. If this strategy to explain the simulation results from a dynamic MSM is valid, then a simple stylized model describing these fundamental relations should be able to capture the long-term trends in inequality among pensioners. The results of the stylized model could then be comparable to those of a dynamic microsimulaton model. This strategy also allows to validate dynamic microsimulation models. This paper uses such a simple model to show some general relations between indexation, retirement age, demographic ageing and the inequality of pensions. The results of this stylized model are then compared to simulation results of a dynamic MSM, in this case MIDAS Belgium. ...|$|E

This is particularly true for self-employed workers because many self-employed individuals do not have large-scale access to employer-sponsored pensions, which are a mainstay of pension support for most workers in developed countries. In this investigation, we explored the saving practices and perceived future <b>pension</b> <b>adequacy</b> of self-employed workers aged 15 – 65 in Germany (N = 702) and the Netherlands (N = 655). Of particular interest for understanding saving practices was whether respondents felt that they voluntarily chose to become self-employed, or whether they felt “forced” to enter self-employment due to economic or labor market pressures. Forced self-employed individuals—some 25 % of those who became selfemployed out of necessity—were found to {{be less likely to}} save for retirement than their voluntary self-employed counterparts, and they envisioned a less optimistic future pension scenario for themselves.

40|$|The Dutch {{pension system}} is highly ranked on adequacy. These rankings, however, {{are based on}} fictitious {{replacement}} rates for median income earners. This paper investigates whether the Dutch <b>pension</b> <b>adequacy</b> is still high when we {{take into account the}} resources that people really accumulate, using a large administrative data set. A comprehensive approach is followed: not only public and private pension rights, but also private savings and housing wealth are taken into account. Summed over all age- and socioeconomic groups we find a median gross replacement rate of 83 % and a net replacement rate of 101 %. At retirement age, 31 % of all households face a gross replacement rate that is lower than 70 % of current income. Public and occupational pensions each account for more than 35 % of total pension annuities. Private non-housing assets account for 14 % and imputed rental income from net housing wealth accounts for about 10 %. Some vulnerable groups, such as the self-employed, have below average replacement rates. Results are fairly similar to results found in the UK, indicating that we should be careful in evaluating the adequacy of pensions systems on the basis of fictitious replacement rates...|$|E
40|$|Discussions of <b>pension</b> <b>adequacy</b> {{for elderly}} Canadians {{have used the}} rate at which income falls with age; the income {{replacement}} rate or the ratio of post-retirement income to pre-retirement income. Use of income streams to assess post-retirement welfare requires a standard against which adequacy of the replacement rates can be judged. Because some expenditures (for example, work-related expenses) can be expected to fall after retirement, a declining income stream does not necessarily signal financial problems for seniors. More importantly, income as normally measured captures only part of what is available to seniors if households possess assets, which in retirement are not being used to generate measured income. This paper uses a different metric, referred to as "potential" income. Potential income is the sum of realized income and the income that could be realized from owned assets such as mutual funds and housing. Households prepare for retirement by saving and borrowing and investing the proceeds. The assets accumulated over a lifetime {{may or may not be}} drawn down in later years. If they are not, income streams underestimate the "potential" income available to support retirement. This paper takes this potential into account when comparing the pre- and post-retirement financial status of Canadian households.
