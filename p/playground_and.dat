5|$|The Crown Roller Mills {{building}} {{is not in}} Princes Street itself, but rather lies {{at the foot of}} Manor Place, close to its intersection with Princes Street. It stands {{at the edge of a}} small area of parkland called the Market Reserve, at the opposite edge of which is the city's main bus depot. This area was swampland when the first European settlers arrived in Dunedin, but was reclaimed and did host a regular market for a few years from the 1870s. The market was not well-supported, however, and eventually folded. The bus depot is located on the site of the city's 1902 Tram workshops. The Market Reserve also contains a children's <b>playground</b> <b>and,</b> at the edge closes to the Crown Roller Mills Building, a small monument dedicated to Otago workers who have lost their lives while at work. This simple bluestone memorial was erected in 2003 by the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions on a site donated by the Dunedin City Council.|$|E
