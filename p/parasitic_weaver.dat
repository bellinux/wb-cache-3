It occurs in grassland in Africa south of the Sahara. The male is mainly yellow and green while the female is buff with dark streaks. The eggs are laid in the nests of other birds.|$|E
50|$|Male cisticolas are polygamous. The female {{builds a}} {{discreet}} nest {{deep in the}} grasses, often binding living leaves into the soft fabric of felted plant down, cobweb, and grass: a cup shape for the zitting cisticola with a canopy of tied-together leaves or grasses overhead for camouflage, a full dome for the golden-headed cisticola. The average clutch is about 4 eggs, which take about 2 weeks to hatch. The <b>parasitic</b> <b>weaver</b> is a specialist parasite of cisticolas and prinias.|$|E
