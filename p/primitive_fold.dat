5000|$|Cervavitus is a genus {{of prehistoric}} deer that lived {{from the late}} Miocene (Vallesian age) to the Early Pleistocene (Villafranchian age) in parts of Western and Eastern Europe, Central Asia and China. It is {{characterized}} by having thorny antlers finished {{in two or three}} points, brachyodont teeth, molars with a <b>primitive</b> <b>fold</b> (known as the [...] "Palaeomeryx fold") and complete lateral metacarpals on their feet, which would serve to move through slope areas. Due to its particular position in the systematics and phylogeny of deer, is considered to form part of the first branches of cervids more advanced than the muntiacines, and perhaps is closely related to the branch that would give rise to the modern genus Cervus, although it has traditionally been classified as part of a separate subfamily called Pliocervinae.|$|E

Today's systems rely on ordinary evaluation semantics to compare expressions in types, frustrating users with type errors arising when evaluation fails to identify two `obviously' equal terms. If only the machine could decide a richer theory! We propose {{a way to}} decide theories which supplement evaluation with `ν-rules', rearranging the neutral parts of normal forms, and report a successful initial experiment.

40|$|How do {{proteins}} accomplish folding {{during early}} evolution? Theoretically the mechanism involves the selective stabilization {{of the native}} structure against all other competing compact conformations {{in a process that}} involves cumulative changes in the amino acid sequence along geological timescales. Thus, an evolved protein folds into a single structure at physiological temperature, but the conformational competition remains latent. For natural proteins such competition should emerge only near cryogenic temperatures, which places it beyond experimental testing. Here, we introduce a designed monomeric miniprotein (FSD- 1 ss) that within biological temperatures (330 – 280 K) switches between simple fast folding and highly complex conformational dynamics in a structurally degenerate compact ensemble. Our findings demonstrate the physical basis for protein folding evolution in a designed protein, which exhibits poorly evolved or primordial folding. Furthermore, these results {{open the door to the}} experimental exploration of <b>primitive</b> <b>folding</b> and the switching between alternative protein structures that takes place in evolutionary branching points and prion diseases, as well as the benchmarking of de novo design methods...|$|R

40|$|Our {{main goal}} is to develop the {{conceptual}} and computational tools necessary to understand {{the evolution of the}} universal processes of translation and replication and to identify events of horizontal gene transfer that occurred within the components. We will attempt to uncover the major evolutionary transitions that accompanied the development of protein synthesis by the ribosome and associated components of the translation apparatus. Our project goes beyond standard genomic approaches to explore homologs that are represented at both the structure and sequence level. Accordingly, use of structural phylogenetic analysis allows us to probe further back into deep evolutionary time than competing approaches, permitting greater resolution of <b>primitive</b> <b>folds</b> and structures. Specifically, our work focuses on the elements of translation, ranging from the emergence of the canonical genetic code to the evolution of specific protein folds, mediated by the predominance of horizontal gene transfer in early life. A unique element of this study is the explicit accounting for the impact of phenotype selection on translation, through a coevolutionary control mechanism. Our work contributes to DOE mission objectives through: (1) sophisticated computer simulation of protein dynamics and evolution, and the further refinement of techniques for structural phylogeny, which complement sequence information, leading to improved annotation of genomic databases; (2) development of evolutionary approaches to exploring cellular function and machinery in an integrated way; and (3) documentation of the phenotype interaction with translation over evolutionary time, reflecting the system response to changing selection pressures through horizontal gene transfer...|$|R

40|$|Diffuse interreflections cause {{effects that}} make current {{theories}} of shape from shading unsatisfactory. We show that distant radiating surfaces produce radiosity effects at low spatial frequencies. This means that, if a shading pattern {{has a small}} region of support, unseen surfaces in the environment can only produce effects that vary slowly over the support region. It is therefore relatively easy to construct matching processes for such patterns that are robust to interreflections. We call regions with these patterns "shading <b>primitives.</b> " <b>Folds</b> and grooves on surfaces provide two examples of shading primitives; the shading pattern is relatively independent of surface shape at a fold or a groove, and the pattern is localised.

40|$|The {{red deer}} {{is well suited}} to {{scientific}} study, given its economic importance as an animal to be hunted, and {{because it has a}} rich genetic heritage. However, there has been little research into the prenatal development of the stomach of ruminants in general, and none for the red deer. For this reason, we undertook histological evaluation of the ontogenesis of the abomasum in red deer. Histomorphometric and immunohistochemical analyses were carried out on 50 embryos and fetuses from the initial stages of prenatal life until birth. The animals were divided for test purposes into five experimental groups: group I [1. 4 – 3. 6 cm crown–rump length (CRL); 30 – 60 days, 1 – 25 % of gestation]; group II (4. 5 – 7. 2 cm CRL; 67 – 90 days, 25 – 35 % of gestation); group III (8 – 19 cm CRL; 97 – 135 days, 35 – 50 % of gestation); group IV (21 – 33 cm CRL; 142 – 191 days, 50 – 70 % of gestation) group V (36 – 40 cm CRL; 205 – 235 days, 75 – 100 % of gestation). In the organogenesis of the primitive gastric tube of red deer, differentiation of the abomasum took place at 67 days, forming a three-layered structure: the epithelial layer (pseudostratified), pluripotential blastemic tissue and serosa. The abomasal wall displayed the <b>primitive</b> <b>folds</b> of the abomasum and by 97 days abomasal peak areas were observed on the fold surface. At 135 days the abomasal surface showed a single mucous cylindrical epithelium, and gastric pits were observed in the spaces between abomasal areas. At the bottom of these pits the first outlines of glands could be observed. The histodifferentiation of the lamina propria-submucosa, tunica muscularis and serosa showed patterns similar to those described for the forestomach of red deer. The abomasum of red deer during prenatal life, especially from 67 days of gestation, was shown to be an active structure with full secretory capacity. Its histological development, its secretory capacity (as revealed by the presence of neutral mucopolysaccharides) and its neuroendocrine nature (as revealed by the presence of positive non-neuronal enolase cells and the neuropeptides vasoactive intestinal peptide and neuropeptide Y) were in line with the development of the rumen, reticulum and omasum. Gastrin-immunoreactive cells first appeared in the abomasum at 142 days, and the number of positive cells increased during development. As for the number of gastrin cells, plasma gastrin concentrations increased throughout prenatal life. However, its prenatal development was later than that of the abomasum in sheep, goat and cow...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe 10 km thick pile of Queyras Schistes lustrés has {{a complex}} structure, {{resulting}} from successive deformation phases (D 1 to D 5). The tectonic history {{starts with the}} building of a syn-subduction wedge through accretion of nappes displaying oceanic and distal European margin series. We relate this early wedging to <b>primitive</b> isoclinal <b>folding</b> (D 1) associated with blueschist metamorphism in Paleocene-Eocene times. Variations in the P-T conditions allow for distinguishing four early-formed regional-scale tectonic units. During subsequent collision, the wedge continues growing through new shortening phases (D 2 to D 4) while metamorphism evolves toward greenschist conditions, mainly during Oligocene times. Orogen-perpendicular F 2 and F 3 folds have opposite facing directions. They still control most of the present-day multiscale structure, which is best visible in an orogen-parallel section. Orogen-parallel F 4 folds produce most of the present-day westward dip of the tectonic pile. Their western equivalents in the nearby Briançonnais zone correspond to the classical back-movements. Extension (D 5) prevails from the Miocene onwards, resulting in west-dipping detachment faults. The major structures associated with D 4 and D 5 are also better visible in an orogen-perpendicular section. Special attention is paid to dolomitic and ophiolitic bodies presently scattered amidst the Schistes lustrés structure. They may be of sedimentary or tectonic origin and are again best visible along the proposed orogen-parallel section...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{know whether}} the protein {{released}} from chaperonin GroEL/ES is in a form committed to the native state or still an aggregatable non-native one, two experiments were carried out. Dilution of the [GroEL-substrate protein] binary complex prior to ATP addition significantly improved the yield of folding, suggesting that the released protein {{has a tendency to}} aggregate. When N-ethylmaleimide treated GroEL, which can form the binary complex but not release the bound protein, was added to the binary complex prior to ATP addition, productive folding was severely inhibited, indicating that the protein released from GroEL/ES can bind to N-ethylmaleimide treated chaperonin. These data favor the ‘reservoir’ or ‘reversion’ model, in which GroEL/ES acts as a buffer of folding intermediate or mediates reversion of a misfolded protein to a less <b>folded</b> <b>primitive</b> form, rather than the ‘marsupium’ model in which folding of the substrate protein proceeds in chaperonin...|$|R

In addition to system S, a generic traversal <b>primitive</b> for <b>folding</b> the children of a term is considered. This primitive is essential for type-changing traversal strategies. The type system which we propose is based on certain signature-independent generic types. We also have to introduce a few constructs which enable us to rephrase untyped Stratego programs in a typeful manner. 1. 1 Preamble We know how to type simple rewrite rules in Stratego. Let us think of a standard rst-order many-sorted type system. We can also learn from other rewriting frameworks how to provide types for (some) rewriting strategies in Stratego. The type system of ELAN, for example, is pretty close to what we need for Stratego {{if we want to}} cover strategy combinators like +, +, and;. The hard part of typing Stratego or {{the underlying}} system S is to cover the generic traversal primitives like 2 (). Therefore, we will focus on generic strategies, especially on concepts required for a corresponding type system. The extended abstract is largely driven by examples. 1. 2 Examples In Figure 1. 1, we illustrate four examples (I) {(IV) of intentionally generic traversals. In (I), all naturals in the given tree are incremented as modelled by the rewrite rule N ! succ(N). We need to turn this rule into a traversal strategy because the rule on its own is not conuent and terminating when considered as rewrite system.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{two-level}} generative model for representing the images and surface depth maps of drapery and clothes. The upper level consists {{of a number of}} folds which will generate the high contrast (ridge) areas with a dictionary of shading primitives (for 2 D images) and <b>fold</b> <b>primitives</b> (for 3 D depth maps). These primitives are represented in parametric forms and are learned in a supervised learning phase using 3 D surfaces of clothes acquired through photometric stereo. The lower level consists of the remaining flat areas which fill between the folds with a smoothness prior (Markov random field). We show that the classical ill-posed problem – shape from shading (SFS) can be much improved by this two-level model for its reduced dimensionality and incorporation of middle-level visual knowledge, i. e. the dictionary of primitives. Given an input image, we first infer the folds and compute a sketch graph using a sketch pursuit algorithm as in the primal sketch [10], [11]. The 3 D folds are estimated by parameter fitting using the fold dictionary and they form the “skeleton ” of the drapery/cloth surfaces. Then the lower level is computed by conventional SFS method using the fold areas as boundary conditions. The two levels interact at the final stage by optimizing a joint Bayesian posterior probability on the depth map. We show a number o...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{invention}} of the first transistors, silicon and germanium have been of fundamental importance in the development of electronic devices. Silicon in particular, due to its great availability and cheapness, is the uncontested leader in the field of microelectronics and integrated circuits. Complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) architectures, which dominate electronic circuit implementations, are totally or almost totally silicon based. Strain engineering of the band structures of semiconductors, made accessible by the introduction of epitactic deposition techniques, such as Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD), has opened a new field of development of heterostructure devices. Heterostructures made of different SiGe alloys, have been thoroughly investigated by several authors. A special type of heterostructures, Si/Ge superlattices, are obtained by alternating n atomic layers of silicon with m layers of germanium. The strong interface effects due to the lattice mismatch between materials of different chemical composition introduce a great variety of new properties. Among them is the possibility to use a single silicon-based device for both electronic and optical purposes. However, the indirect gap of both silicon and germanium represents an obstacle to the achievement of this goal. Recently, a new type of silicon multilayer structure has been proposed, fabricated by deposition of quantum dots on thin silicon membranes. The obtained structure was composed of alternating unstrained silicon layers and strained silicon layers, i. e. a superlattice with unit cells made of the same material but under different strain conditions. Such a structure has features similar to two-component superlattices, but with interface effects depending only on the different strain conditions. The potential of this new material has been inspected by Z. Liu and co-workers by means of an ab initio framework. The present work investigates the properties of these single-element strained superlattices, exploiting the atomistic semi-empirical tight-binding (TB) model. The TB model has been first proposed by F. Bloch in 1928, and implemented by J. C. Slater and G. F. Koster. The TB model consists in expanding the crystal states in linear combinations of atomic-like orbitals. In the semi-empirical approach, the expectation value of the one-electron hamiltonian on this set of orbitals is given in terms of an appropriate set of parameters. The values of the parameters are determined from the requirement that the computed band structure matches the energy band structures obtained by experiments. Considerations on the number of interacting centers and on the number of orbitals strongly influence the possibility to reproduce reliable physical results. TB studies on electronic and optical properties of group-IV semiconductors which exploit the parametrization of reference have shown to reproduce a large number of measured properties. In the present work, an application of the TB model to single-element strain superlattices of silicon and germanium has been proposed. The inspected crystal structures have been generated by repeating periodically a cell composed of a variable number of atomic layers of a given material. Strain has been applied to half the layers of the cell along the crystal growth direction, which is chosen along the (001) direction. The behaviour of the band structures has been investigated varying the number of layers and the magnitude of the applied strain. Electronic properties in semiconductors depend on the electronic (hole) states in the lowest conduction (topmost valence) band. The energy of the extrema of these bands are strongly influenced by strain. For silicon bulk structures, the minima of the lowest conduction band along the growth direction and the orthogonal directions split, with the energy difference {{depending on the type of}} strain. Splitting also occurs in the topmost valence bands, as a consquence of the interplay between strain and spin-orbit coupling. In germanium bulk structures, no splitting of the minima of the conduction band occurs. However, under tensile strain along the (001) direction, the shape of the lowest conduction band changes, changing the position of its minimum. For large tensile strain, the minimum may occur at the same point in momentum space as the maximum of the topmost valence point (the origin of the Brillouin zone) and the typical indirect gap of group-IV semiconductors may become direct. The present TB calculations performed on silicon and germanium single-element strained superlattices give an accurate description of their electronic band structure, showing some important features. It has been shown that not only the strain conditions, but also the cell size strongly influences the behaviour of the near gap region bands. For instance, in silicon strained superlattices, for long cells and tensile strain along the growth direction, the energy of the minima along the same direction becomes lower than the energy of the orthogonal minima, while, from analyses of the bulk structure, the opposite behaviour is expected. Explanations in terms of confinements and effective masses have been used to properly justify these differences. Some particular interesting strain-size configuration has been deeper investigated, as for example, large silicon superlattices cells under compressive (001) -strain, candidates for direct gap materials. The predicted direct gap has been obtained, but it has been shown that the minimum of the lowest conduction band folds in the origin of the Brillouin zone as a consequence of the geometry of the <b>primitive</b> cell. This <b>folding</b> effect may lead to small first-order optical transitions and computation of the optical matrix elements is necessary to determine the effective magnitude of optical gain. The most important result of this work concerns the possibility to obtain a direct gap in germanium strained superlattices. As expected from anlyses of the bulk structure, a direct gap occurs in tensile (001) -strained cells. As in the case of silicon, the size of the cell plays a fundamental role and only large tensile strained cells show the desired behaviour. However, the direct gap in germanium, on the contrary of silicon, is genuine, i. e. not a consequence of folding effects, and optical gain is shown to be relevant. Thus, these cells have been further investigated, describing their properties, as for example the gap width, which determines the energy of the radiation involved in optical transitions. The results of the present work, especially for large germanium single-element tensile strained superlattices, show the potential of these new structures for applications in optoelectronics...|$|R
