"His plan briefly {{was that}} he should obtain a fresh will, [...] {{appointing}} him sole heir to the General's estate {{in the event of}} a [...] boy of six or seven years old dying before he came of age. He had [...] somehow obtained a copy of the General's will, and had notes in the [...] General's handwriting. There were two things to be done, first that [...] he should get instructions for the draft of the will drawn up in [...] <b>precise</b> <b>imitation</b> of the General's handwriting, containing all the [...] provisions of the former will, except that he was made heir in [...] place of Miss Covington in the event of his grandson's death. There [...] are a dozen men in London who can imitate handwriting so as to [...] defy detection, and I introduced him to one of them, who drew up [...] the instructions.

60|$|It follows, therefore, {{that of the}} {{materials}} which an author has to use in a romance, or fictitious composition, such as I have ventured to attempt, he will find that a great proportion, both of language and manners, is as proper to the present time as to those {{in which he has}} laid his time of action. The freedom of choice which this allows him, is therefore much greater, and the difficulty of his task much more diminished, than at first appears. To take an illustration from a sister art, the antiquarian details may be said to represent the peculiar features of a landscape under delineation of the pencil. His feudal tower must arise in due majesty; the figures which he introduces must have the costume and character of their age; the piece must represent the peculiar features of the scene which he has chosen for his subject, with all its appropriate elevation of rock, or precipitate descent of cataract. His general colouring, too, must be copied from Nature: The sky must be clouded or serene, according to the climate, and the general tints must be those which prevail in a natural landscape. So far the painter is bound down by the rules of his art, to a <b>precise</b> <b>imitation</b> of the features of Nature; but it is not required that he should descend to copy all her more minute features, or represent with absolute exactness the very herbs, flowers, and trees, with which the spot is decorated. These, as well as all the more minute points of light and shadow, are attributes proper to scenery in general, natural to each situation, and subject to the artist's disposal, as his taste or pleasure may dictate.|$|E
60|$|To see how {{arbitrarily}} these essences {{of mixed}} modes {{are made by}} the mind, we need but take a view of almost any of them. A little looking into them will satisfy us, {{that it is the}} mind that combines several scattered independent ideas into one complex one; and, by the common name it gives them, makes them the essence of a certain species, without regulating itself by any connexion they have in nature. For what greater connexion in nature has the idea of a man than the idea of a sheep with killing, that this is made a particular species of action, signified by the word MURDER, and the other not? Or what union is there in nature between the idea of the relation of a father with killing than that of a son or neighbour, that those are combined into one complex idea, and thereby made the essence of the distinct species PARRICIDE, whilst the other makes no distinct species at all? But, though they have made killing a man's father or mother a distinct species from killing his son or daughter, yet, in some other cases, son and daughter are taken in too, as well as father and mother: and they are all equally comprehended in the same species, as in that of INCEST. Thus the mind in mixed modes arbitrarily unites into complex ideas such as it finds convenient; whilst others that have altogether as much union in nature are left loose, and never combined into one idea, because they have no need of one name. It is evident then that the mind, by its free choice, gives a connexion to a certain number of ideas, which in nature have no more union with one another than others that it leaves out: why else is the part of the weapon the beginning of the wound is made with taken notice of, to make the distinct species called STABBING, and the figure and matter of the weapon left out? I do not say this is done without reason, as we shall see more by and by; but this I say, that it is done by the free choice of the mind, pursuing its own ends; and that, therefore, these species of mixed modes are the workmanship of the understanding. And there is nothing more evident than that, for the most part, in the framing these ideas, the mind searches not its patterns in nature, nor refers the ideas it makes to the real existence of things, but puts such together as may best serve its own purposes, without tying itself to a <b>precise</b> <b>imitation</b> of anything that really exists.|$|E

30|$|The main {{contributions}} {{of our research}} are: (1) designing a modular motion sensing framework, which can bind brands of input devices and manipulators together, (2) proposing to use the ROS built-in rosinstall mechanism to update hardware interfaces over the air for general hardware compatibility. However, {{there are still some}} issues and improvements to be addressed in our future work: first, dynamic response and accuracy improvement. The performance variations between different motion sensors made it difficult for our algorithm to evaluate and take an unified control; second, smart and robust trajectory replication. In teach-pendant operation pattern, the system is a typical human-in-the-loop. With DTW spacing registration method, the requirement for <b>precise</b> trajectory <b>imitation</b> was not so high. Thus, our future works are: (1) quantitative analysis of dynamic behaviors and accuracy, (2) trajectory replication performance improvement, (3) application of dual-arm manipulation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—a {{cochlear}} implant is a prosthetic device surgically implanted {{into the inner}} ear {{that is used to}} restore partial hearing in profoundly deaf people. This device is applicable only to those patients whose auditory nerves are intact. The function of {{cochlear implant}} is a replacement of damaged inner ear using external Body Worn Speech Processor (BWSP) and internal receiver stimulator. The stimulator stimulates auditory nerve via electrode array that enable understanding the speech by brain. CI has undergone several advancement in terms of signal processing strategies, the transmission link and the electrode array. Signal processing strategies plays a significant role in performance of CI. The speech processing strategies need more <b>precise</b> <b>imitation</b> of biological cochlear function so that more subtle control of auditory nerve response is possible. There exist different schemes of transmitting the signal from external processor to the implanted electrodes. Index Terms—Prosthetic, formants, speech processor, cochlea, insertion depth, AGC, DRNL.

Some parallel applications do not require a <b>precise</b> <b>imitation</b> of the behaviour of the physically shared memory programming model. Consequently, certain parallel machine architectures have elected to emphasise different required coherency properties because of possible efficiency gains. This has led to various definitions of models of store coherency. These definitions have not been amenable to detailed analysis and, consequently, inconsistencies have resulted. In this paper a unified framework is proposed in which different models of store coherency are developed systematically by progressively relaxing the constraints that they have to satisfy. A demonstration is given of how formal reasoning can be cam’ed out to compare different models. Some real-life systems are considered and a definition of a version of weak coherency is found to be incomplete...|$|E
40|$|Here we {{show how}} a migratory songbird, the {{chipping}} sparrow (Spizella passerina), achieves prompt and <b>precise</b> vocal <b>imitation.</b> Juvenile chipping sparrow males develop {{five to seven}} potential precursor songs; the normal development of these songs requires intact hearing but not imitation from external models. The potential precursor songs conform with general species-typical song parameters but differ from the song of wild, adult territorial males. As chipping sparrow males return from migration to start their first breeding season, they settle close to an older adult. The young male then stops producing {{all but one of}} its precursor songs, retaining the one that most resembles that of its neighbor. This single song then becomes more variable and, in a matter of days, is altered to closely match the neighbor's song. This elegant solution ensures species specificity and promptness of imitation...|$|R
50|$|Building {{upon the}} {{teaching}} methods of Pestalozzi, Herbart contributed to pedagogy a psychological basis to help facilitate better learning {{as well as}} to ensure children’s character development. He was the first individual to point out how important a role psychology plays on education. In developing his ideas about psychology, Herbart came to disagree with Kant about how true knowledge is obtained. Kant believed that we become knowledgeable through studying the innate categories of thought, while Herbart believed that one learns only from studying external and real objects in the world as well as the ideas that come about from observing them. Examining the difference between the actual existence of an object and its appearance, Herbart concluded that “the world is a world of things-in-themselves and the things-in-themselves are perceivable.” Everything’s appearance indicates that it exists. He considered all external objects existing in the world as reals, which can be compared to Leibniz's concept of monads. Subscribing to Locke's empiricist viewpoint involving the tabula rasa, Herbart believed that the soul had no innate ideas or no already pre-established Kantian categories of thought. The soul, considered to be a real, was thought to be completely passive initially as well as very resistant to changes outside factors exert and force upon it. Even though reals are disrupted by other forces appearing to cause a change in the reals themselves, they are thought to be unchangeable. Reals tend to collide and struggle with one another so much so that each real fights for its own self-preservation (Selbsterhaltung). The way in which the soul helps to preserve itself from its outwardly perceived destruction is through Herbart’s concept of Vorstellungen, or ideas or mental representations. These ideas were regarded as dynamic forces that Herbart attempted to explain by means of mathematical formulas. Newton’s influence can be seen in Herbart’s beliefs about how forces mechanically interact with one another in the world to affect perceptions of reality. The mechanics of ideas involved their ability to move in different ways, whether they be moving up into the conscious or delving down into the unconscious. Different ideas come into contact with each other and result in more complex ideas through the processes of blending, fusing, fading and combining in a multitude of approaches. It is evident Herbart thought that ideas were not <b>precise</b> <b>imitations</b> of the existing items in the world but that they were the direct consequence of the interactions of individuals’ experiences with the external environment. An individual can only gain all the facts and their associated truth by understanding how their mental representations combine and potentially inhibit or contribute to one another.|$|R
40|$|The {{debate about}} the precise {{relationship}} between theatre and society is an old and honourable one - whether {{in terms of the}} Shakespearean metaphor Oorfles utilizes (along with a vast range of other writers), or in terms of Aristotle's Mimesis, Or Johnson's Nature, Coleridge's Truth, and the many other metaphors used to indicate the representative nature of the arts. The way one perceives this clearly has {{a great deal to do}} with who one is and how one has been socialized oneself. It is also clear from even the most superficial reading of the many theorists over the ages, that no-one sees it as a simple, predictable or even dependable relationship, or even a matter of <b>precise</b> unmeditated <b>imitation</b> of an external 'reality'. 1 It is too dependent on human beings and their complex and perverse natures to be so. It is also perceived as an 'art' created by an individual'artist' - and the terms art and artist are themselves concepts of some flexibility. But all agree, somewhere along the line, that there is a relationship of some kind between a performance and the socio-cultural context in which it occurs.

40|$|The remarkably strong {{propensity}} {{in female}} flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans) for retrieving their young {{has been noted}} by several naturalists. In one instance (Stack 1925) a female climbed up the pant-leg of an observer who had removed the young from a nest; she took four babies from the observer's hand and carried each of them to another tree cavity. During my own field work I have often observed female G. volans behave in this way; they have removed young even from my pocket. The retrieving behaviour {{is so strong that}} I began to rely on it in capturing lactating females, which attempted to retrieve the young placed in a trap, bag, or even a sock. The females seem to be attracted primarily by the sounds emitted by the young. The sounds apparently need not be very <b>precise.</b> Even approximate <b>imitations</b> of them by this observer induced females to search around in the observ-er's clothing and around the face. The sounds sometimes appear to be ultrasonic, i. e. the babies can be seen going through the motions of making the sound and the female responds, but nothing can be heard by the human observer. In this regard the young appear to be similar to those of other rodents (Zippelius & Schleidt 1956; Hart & King 1966). Odour and visual stimuli also seem to be important. In retrieving, the female flying squirrels behave much like females of other rodent...|$|R
