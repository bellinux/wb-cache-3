40|$|From this paper's Preface, by Dr. Dimitri B. Papadimitriou, President: As his {{new term}} begins, <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{trying to focus}} his {{domestic}} agenda on {{what he calls the}} Òownership society,Ó a sweeping vision of an America in which more citizens would hold significant assets and be free to make their own choices about providing for their health care and retirement, and educating their children. L. Randall Wray, who has written for the Levy Institute on many topics, evaluates the premises and logic of this program in this new public policy brief. Wray points out that much {{of the history of the}} Western world since the advent of liberalism has been marked by a gradual rise in the power of those who lack property. Some of the milestones in this progression include universal suffrage, regulation of business, and progressive taxation. BushÕs ownership society proposals, according to Wray, would result in a partial reversal of the progress of the last 250 years. The reason is that, while BushÕs plans would undoubtedly increase the choices and power of those who have property, they would fail to democratize ownership. Many gains to the wealthy would come at the expense of the poor, the sick, and the elderly. Consider, for example, the condition of the nationÕs private pension system. Increasingly, firms are switching from defined-benefit to definedcontribution plans. This development would seem on its surface to favor the establishment of a new class of stockholders, empowered and holding a larger stake in the system. But, as Wray demonstrates, retirement accounts and other assets just do not add up to a substantial amount for most Americans. This means that most citizens have much to lose indeed from attacks on Social Security and the erosion of the traditional pension system. Much as the safety net for the poor has largely vanished since the Reagan years, the bread-and-butter benefits and rights of the middle class are now threatened by the ownership-society agenda. To many, the claim made by Republicans that all should take responsibility for their wellbeing rings true. But it is important to keep in mind the real alternative to public benefits for the middle class: a society in which success would depend largely upon luck, inheritances, or charity. A society that forces individuals to read their future in their Microsoft Money files inevitably creates a class of nonowners who are insecure and lack independent means. Ironically, this runs up against the aims of those who sincerely hope for a world in which more have the opportunity to become rich: moving upward often brings some setbacks along the way, which might be fatal in a world of reduced bankruptcy protection, disability and medical benefits, and educational aid. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the {{relationships}} between nations invasions of foreign countries are becoming less relevant. Under US <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> Iraq <b>has</b> <b>been</b> invaded, but already his successor Obama, assumed that sheer invading of countries nowadays appeared as something obsolescent, as it is opposed to the modern sentiment of democracy, spreading, either with nations or individuals. In the crisis-areas witnessed nowadays in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East the US tries still to solve the occurring problems, but doesn’t want to deploy ground troops, to overshadow with local population, which would create the suspect of invasion, a break with the general democratic feeling. It is not sure if this concept is going always to work in practical terms, but the intention is clear: it is preferable for crises to be solved by the domestic population, with foreign mixing as less as possible. Such an attitude changes many things {{in the realm of}} international competition, which is therefore more and more shifted to the economic realm. Democratic view-points emerge also if we stare at the huge migrant flows, which are trying to abandon poor and badly administered countries, like some in the Middle East or the South of the World, heading to those with better economic standing, which stays in the center of ruler's preoccupations, like in Western Europe, or in the US, places those, where the Central Bank CEO is becoming almost more important than politicians. In such countries, an important issue is the fiscal standing, depending on the presence of Regional Groupings like the EZ (EUROZONE), offering the advantage of large markets and a common currency, a situation which in the US was realized already some hundreds years ago. But there are advantages and disadvantages of this new situation: the main disadvantage is emerging in the fiscal area. For a given nation, the membership in the EZ brings, for instance, to a loss of economic independence, as it has to stick to the rules imposed by the Grouping affiliation. In such a situation paramount becomes the importance of developing and growing enterprises. The advantage of the economic environment offered by EU (EUROPEAN UNION), EZ, or US for single enterprises is given by the wide market space offered to its striving and developing efforts, assessing its potential of growth. In the article the fiscal situation of various nations is studied and examples of companies are made, looking of confirmation for the theses expressed. Easy explanations for company success often defy common wisdom. The catchword “innovation” is nowadays very much preferred, but not all of the examples proposed are based principally on it. Some of the reasons for company success remain hidden to common rationality and are based on a mix of individual creativity, invention, application, genius, organization and plannin...|$|R

40|$|In {{the summer}} of 2001, family farmers and ranchers {{throughout}} North America are struggling. During the 1993 debate {{over the fate of}} the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Florida farmers and ranchers as well as farm communities across the U. S. were promised that NAFTA would provide access to new export markets and thus would finally bring a lasting solution to farmers off-and-on struggles for economic success. Now, seven years later, the evidence shows the income of independent Florida farmers has declined, consumer prices have risen while some giant agribusinesses have reaped huge profits. Florida has lost 1, 000 small and medium sized farms since NAFTA went into effect. Total net income for "farm operations" in Florida increased between 1993 and 1999 but all of the income gain was in corporate farms. When corporate income increases are eliminated farm income drops steeply in Florida. During the seven years of NAFTA, net farm income for non-corporate Florida farm operations fell 74. 4 % between 1993 and 1999 from $ 51. 4 million to $ 13. 4 million. These bad outcomes for independent farmers are defining the growing national debates over <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> s proposals to establish Fast Track trade authority and to expand NAFTA to 31 other Latin American and Caribbean nations through the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). This report documents the results that are causing farmers concern about NAFTA and its model of export-oriented agriculture. This special Florida supplement to a recent national report on NAFTA s agriculture-sector outcomes examines the impact of NAFTA on Florida farmers. For the past seven years, Florida vegetable growers, especially tomato and bell pepper growers, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> facing intense pressure from increasing imported vegetables from Mexico. Florida s citrus crop, the jewel of Florida s agriculture production, is already facing increased pressure from Mexico and will face even further import threats if <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> is granted Fast Track trade authority. <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> announced he <b>is</b> seeking trade authority to negotiate FTAA NAFTA expansion which could result in Florida facing severe competition from powerhouse citrus producer Brazil. Farmers raising beef cattle in Florida who have seen incomes decline as farmgate prices for beef have collapsed in Florida under NAFTA would face new FTAA imports from beef giants Argentina and Brazil. Moreover, sugarcane farmers, who received special protection from Mexican sugar imports when NAFTA was negotiated, face even greater threats from FTAA nation Brazil which dominates the world sugar trade. Brazil has announced that access tothe U. S. for its citrus, beef, and sugar is a non-negotiable requirement for any FTAA deal.

40|$|Even {{before the}} framing of the Constitution, the Framers feared an {{executive}} power that would grow too strong. This fear was reflected throughout debates held before, during, {{and after the}} American Revolution. Even today, debate still continues {{as to what the}} executive power entails when it comes to acts of war and treaties. The United States Constitution was framed with the purpose of dividing power between the branches of government in order to avoid abuse and tyranny. “The Constitution bestows enormous power and responsibility on the President to protect the nation’s security and safeguard the people’s liberty” (Matheson 1). Throughout the history of the United States, the President has had to find the delicate and important balance between liberty and security. That balance is most fully manifested through the President’s interpretation and carrying out of the executive power during national security crises. This thesis will examine in-depth the Framer’s giving the President the power of prerogative during national security crises as outlined in Article I Section 8 and Article II Section II of the Constitution. It will focus on the works of Locke, Montesquieu, and Blackstone, {{as well as on the}} British system of government and the Framers’ decision to give prerogative to the President of the United States. The British model had a tremendous influence on the framing of the 18 th century Anglo-American Constitution and what the Framers understood as the powers of the Commander-in-Chief. Locke, Montesquieu, and Blackstone argued in favor of separation of powers, a federative power, and the executive having absolute power on issues of war. These three men in particular would have a tremendous influence on the Framers and their view on executive war powers. My thesis will also examine the important change in the Constitution’s Declare War Clause, specifically the change in the wording from “make” to “declare war. ” I contend that although Congress was given the power in Article I, section 8 (11) to declare war, by changing the language from “make” to “declare” in that provision, the Framers of the Constitution intended to give the President the power to engage the country in war without the consent of Congress. I will provide evidence for this argument by reviewing three significant episodes in the exercise of national security power by the President: President George Washington’s Neutrality Proclamation, as discussed in the Pacificus-Helvidius debates, Abraham Lincoln’s suspension of the writ of habeas corpus and use of military tribunals during the Civil War, and <b>President</b> George W. <b>Bush’s</b> invasion of Iraq with the approval of Congress through the Authorized Use of Military Force, as well as surveillance and detainee programs. These three case studies are important examples of the President using his executive power to protect the nation from threats both at home and abroad. They were crucial moments in American history which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> criticized by many as an abuse of Presidential power. However, when examined, these critical events demonstrate the Framers’ intent to give the President the power of prerogative and the Presidents’ correct use of that power.
