For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm.|$|E
5|$|Located on the Atlantic {{coast of}} the Sahara Desert, it lies {{on the west coast}} of Africa. With the {{exception}} of Friendship Port and a small fishing port, the coastal strip is mostly left empty and allowed to flood. The coastline includes shifting sandbanks and sandy beaches. There are areas of quicksand close to the harbour. Nouakchott is largely flat and only a few meters above sea level. It is threatened by the sand dunes advancing from its eastern side which pose a daily <b>problem.</b> <b>There</b> have been efforts to save particular areas, including work by Jean Meunier. Owing to the rapid build-up, the city is quite spread out, with few tall buildings. Most buildings are one-story.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the concept}} {{appeared}} {{to offer a}} solution to the tracking <b>problem,</b> <b>there</b> was almost no information on either the physics of re-entry or a strong understanding of the normal composition of the upper layers of the ionosphere. ARPA began to address both simultaneously. To better understand the radar returns from a warhead, several radars were built on Kwajalein Atoll, while Arecibo started with the dual purpose of understanding the ionosphere's F-layer while also producing a general-purpose scientific radio observatory.|$|E

25|$|The {{restricted}} problem (both circular and elliptical) was {{worked on}} extensively by many famous mathematicians and physicists, most notably by Poincaré {{at the end}} of the 19th century. Poincaré's work on the restricted three-body problem was the foundation of deterministic chaos theory. In the restricted <b>problem,</b> <b>there</b> exist five equilibrium points. Three are collinear with the masses (in the rotating frame) and are unstable. The remaining two are located on the third vertex of both equilateral triangles of which the two bodies are the first and second vertices.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{optimism}} bias occurs for both positive events, such as believing oneself {{to be more}} financially successful than others, and negative events, such as being {{less likely to have}} a drinking <b>problem,</b> <b>there</b> is more research and evidence suggesting that the bias is stronger for negative events. Different consequences result from these two types of events: positive events often lead to feelings of well being and self-esteem, while negative events lead to consequences involving more risk, such as engaging in risky behaviors and not taking precautionary measures for safety.|$|E

There was however a slight <b>problem.</b> <b>There</b> was no way to get the locomotives needed onto these rails. The Bridging Train was therefore tasked with building new wharves to unload the locomotives that would be needed for the desert trains, which they did by converting two small vessels into floating pile drivers.|$|E

25|$|Because the {{agricultural}} industry was losing {{millions of dollars}} annually due to treatment and loss of fly-struck animals, this solution was quickly approved for testing. It was first applied {{on a large scale}} in Florida in the 1950s, due both to the severity of the <b>problem</b> <b>there</b> and to the state’s unique island-mimicking geography, which allowed for relative isolation of the Florida C. hominivorax population. The eradication of Florida's primary screwworm population was completed in 1959. The program was then applied throughout the southern United States, and eventually adopted through much of Mexico in 1972 and parts of Central and South America. The primary screwworm was completely eradicated from the southern United States in 1966 and from Mexico in 1991. Livestock there continue to be vulnerable, however, and strict laws regarding animal inspection and reporting of suspected infestations remain in place.|$|E
25|$|A mobile phone, or cell phone, is a long-range, {{electronic}} device used for mobile voice or data communication over {{a network of}} specialized base stations known as cell sites. Early mobile FM radio telephones were in use for many years, but since the number of radio frequencies were very limited in any area, the number of phone calls were also very limited. To solve this <b>problem,</b> <b>there</b> could be many small areas called cells which share the same frequencies. When users moved from one area to another while calling, the call {{would have to be}} switched over automatically without losing the call. In this system, a small number of radio frequencies could accommodate a huge number of calls. The first mobile call was made from a car phone in St. Louis, Missouri on June 17, 1946, but the system was impractical from what is considered a portable handset today. The equipment weighed 80lbs, and the AT service, basically a massive party line, cost $30 per month plus 30 to 40 cents per local call. The basic network and supporting infrastructure of hexagonal cells used to support a mobile telephony system while remaining on the same channel were devised by Douglas H. Ring and W. Rae Young at AT Bell Labs in 1947. Finally in 1973, Martin Cooper invented the first handheld cellular/mobile phone. His first mobile phone call was made to Joel S. Engel in April 1973.|$|E

At a deeper level, there are still basic conceptual issues that remain unresolved. [...] Many scientists have found it difficult to reconcile the fact that information is distributed across multiple brain areas with the apparent unity of consciousness: this is one aspect of the so-called binding <b>problem.</b> <b>There</b> are also some scientists who have expressed grave reservations about the idea that the brain forms representations of the outside world at all: influential members of this group include psychologist J.
