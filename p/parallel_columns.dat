In the Book of Revelation he altered his fourth edition (1527) in about 90 passages {{on the basis of the}} Complutensian text. Unfortunately Erasmus had forgotten what places of the Apocalypse he translated from Latin and he did not correct all of them. Except in the Revelation, the fourth edition differed only in about 20 places from his third (according to Mill about 10 places). The fourth edition was printed in three <b>parallel</b> <b>columns,</b> they contain the Greek, Erasmus' own Latin version, and the Vulgate.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1896, Edison had {{turned his attention to}} promoting a projector technology, the Phantoscope, developed by young inventors Charles Francis Jenkins and Thomas Armat. The rights to the system had been acquired by Raff and Gammon, who redubbed it the Vitascope and arranged with Edison to present himself as its creator. With Dickson having left his employ, the Kinetophone was soon mothballed and Edison suspended work on sound cinema for an extended period. Departing the Vitascope operation after little more than a year, Edison commissioned the development of his own projection systems, the Projectoscope and then multiple iterations of the Projecting Kinetoscope. In 1912, he introduced the ambitious and expensive Home Projecting Kinetoscope, which employed a unique format of three <b>parallel</b> <b>columns</b> of sequential frames on one strip of film—the middle column ran through the machine in the reverse direction from its neighbors. It was a commercial failure. Four years later, the Edison operation came out with its last substantial new film exhibition technology, a short-lived theatrical system called the Super Kinetoscope. Much of the Edison company's most creative work in the motion picture field from 1897 on involved the use of Kinetoscope-related patents in threatened or actual lawsuits for the purpose of financially pressuring or blocking commercial rivals.|$|E
5|$|Once Jellicoe's ships had rendezvoused {{with the}} 2nd Battle Squadron, coming from Cromarty, Scotland, {{on the morning}} of 31 May, he {{organised}} {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet in <b>parallel</b> <b>columns</b> of divisions of four dreadnoughts each. The two divisions of the 2nd Battle Squadron were on his left (east), the 4th Battle Squadron was in the centre and the 1st Battle Squadron on the right. When Jellicoe ordered the Grand Fleet to deploy to the left and form line astern in anticipation of encountering the High Seas Fleet, this naturally placed the 2nd Battle Squadron at the head of the line of battle. The sisters were able to fire a few volleys at the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group without effect early in the battle, but the manoeuvers of their escorting light cruisers frequently blocked their views of the German ships. Coupled with the visibility problems from the smoke and mist, none of the King George Vs were able to fire more than 19 rounds from their main guns.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to this rejection, the bishops issued a unanimous statement, asserting the Church of England's right to order its forms of worship and, in 1929, the Upper House of the Convocation of Canterbury resolved that bishops might approve {{the use of the}} 1928 book, notwithstanding the lack of parliamentary authority. It became common for prayer books to be printed with the 1662 and 1928 forms of service in <b>parallel</b> <b>columns,</b> although the legal basis of the revision remained unclear. The 1928 revised forms of Matrimony and Baptism were quite widely adopted, but those of other rites tended not to be; the consequence, in practice, being very wide variation in liturgical practice from parish to parish, with very few clergy adhering consistently to the strict observation of either the 1662 or the 1928 forms of worship.|$|E
25|$|Departing {{from the}} Roman {{military}} tradition of engaging {{the enemy in}} pitched battle as soon as possible, Fabius invented the Fabian strategy: refusing open battle with his opponent, but constantly skirmishing with small detachments of the enemy. This course was not popular among the soldiers, earning Fabius the nickname Cunctator ("delayer"), since he seemed to avoid battle while Italy was being ravaged by the enemy. Moreover, it was widely feared that, if Hannibal continued to plunder Italy unopposed, the terrified allies, believing that Rome was incapable of protecting them, might defect and pledge their allegiance to the Carthaginians. As a countermeasure, residents of villages were encouraged to post lookouts, {{so that they could}} gather their livestock and possessions in time and take refuge in fortified towns that the enemy could not yet take. Fabius' policy was to shadow Hannibal by moving on the heights parallel to the Carthaginian movements on the plains, to avoid Hannibal's cavalry which was supreme on flat terrain. This demanded great care, since the Carthaginian tried with all his skill to ambush the Romans. For this reason, a new marching formation, with three <b>parallel</b> <b>columns</b> of infantry, was developed instead of the single column that had been in use at Lake Trasimene.|$|E

500|$|Although A.hygrometricus bears a {{superficial}} resemblance to {{member of the}} [...] "true earthstars" [...] Geastrum, it may be readily differentiated from most by the hygroscopic nature of its rays. Hygroscopic earthstars include G.arenarium, G.corollinum, G.floriforme, G.recolligens, and G.kotlabae. Unlike Geastrum, the young fruit bodies of A.hygrometricus {{do not have a}} columella (sterile tissue in the gleba, {{at the base of the}} spore sac). Geastrum tends to have its spore sac opening surrounded by a peristome or a disc, in contrast with the single lacerate slit of A.hygrometricus. There are also several microscopic differences: in A.hygrometricus, the basidia are not arranged in <b>parallel</b> <b>columns,</b> the spores are larger, and the threads of the capillitia are branched and continuous with the hyphae of the peridium. Despite these differences, older specimens can be difficult to distinguish from Geastrum in the field. One species of Geastrum, G.mammosum, does have thick and brittle rays that are moderately hygroscopic, and could be confused with A.hygrometricus; however, its spores are smaller than A.hygrometricus, typically about 4µm in diameter.|$|E
40|$|Comprehensive {{two-dimensional}} {{gas chromatography}} (GC x GC) {{suffers from the}} impossibility to operate both dimensions at their optimum carrier gas velocity {{at the same time}} due to the different inner diameters of the columns typically employed. The use of multiple <b>parallel</b> capillary <b>columns</b> in the second dimension (GC x multi-GC) is studied as a means to achieve simultaneous optimum-velocity operation. A programme written in Microsoft Excel (R) was developed to calculate the efficiency of the two dimensions in GC x multi-GC for different numbers of columns in the second dimension. With the aid of this programme the appropriate number of columns was selected. Columns with maximum repeatability were specifically manufactured to grand suitable performance, i. e. to avoid band broadening effects caused by inter-column variations. 1 D-GC experiments were carried out on the columns separately and combined in parallel. The performance of the <b>parallel</b> <b>column</b> set was consistent with that of the individual columns, with over 9100 plates generated (approximately 10, 000 plates/m).
