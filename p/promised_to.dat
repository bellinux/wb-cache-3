More importantly the British <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> support {{the rule of the}} Al Khalifa in Bahrain, securing its unstable position as rulers of the country.

5|$|Regarding public housing, Tufaro {{called for}} renovations rather than {{demolishing}} vacant buildings, which drew criticism, as Housing Commissioner Daniel P.

O'Malley <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> enforce provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which require banks to invest in poor neighborhoods. Tufaro further proposed a plan for school vouchers and to drug test students, which drew opposition from the Baltimore Teachers Union and from O'Malley, who favored expanding pre-kindergarten and after-school programs, while making summer school mandatory. When discussing the problem of HIV/AIDS in Baltimore, which disproportionately affects African Americans, both O'Malley and Tufaro <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> continue the city's needle exchange program.|$|E

5000|$|Modern {{contract}} {{theory has}} also permitted remedies on alternative theories such as promissory estoppel. Also, modifications to existing lease agreements (as {{opposed to the}} creation of a new lease agreement) do not require consideration, nor do modifications to existing sale contracts [...] Furthermore a <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> perform a moral obligation—the classic example is of a <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> support a person injured while coming to the rescue of the promisor—is enforceable provided the promissee was harmed in conferring a benefit on the promisor and the promise is not disproportionate to the benefit. The <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> pay a debt discharged by bankruptcy, the <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> perform a conditional responsibility despite the nonoccurrence of the condition, and the <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> perform on a voidable contract form a category of moral obligations that can bind in the absence of consideration.|$|R

5|$|The {{build-up}} {{towards a}} war involving Lombards, Gepids, and Byzantines started possibly in 548 or 549, with Audoin and Thurisind each sending an embassy to Justinian's court at Constantinople, {{in attempts to}} obtain military support from Justinian or at least, {{in the case of}} Thurisind, to get a pledge of neutrality. To sway Justinian, Thurisind's envoys reminded him of their long tradition of alliance and <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> fight against Byzantium's enemies. However, the emperor sided with the Lombards; he made them formal allies and <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> provide troops against the Gepids. From Justinian's perspective, this war was of major importance in the larger context of the Gothic War, because possession of Pannonia was strategically necessary to keep open land communications between Italy and the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|The {{inaugural address}} was a {{detailed}} {{statement of the}} Whig agenda, essentially a repudiation of Jackson and Van Buren's policies.

5|$|The {{institution}} {{of the welfare state}} was by 1957 accepted by both major parties. Diefenbaker <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> expand the national health insurance scheme to cover tubercular and mental health patients. He characterized the old age pension increase which the Liberal government was instituting as a mere pittance, not even enough {{to keep up with the}} cost of living. Diefenbaker noted that the increase only amounted to twenty cents a day, using that figure to ridicule Liberal contentions that an increase would add to the rate of inflation. All three opposition parties <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> increase the pension, with the Social Crediters and CCF even stating the specific amounts it would be raised by.|$|E
