40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognized}} that the pile capacity depends upon pile size and soil condition, the effect of <b>pile</b> <b>weight</b> has never been considered. In order to unveil this matter, the small scale modeling technique (1 g) {{is one of the}} proper ways to solve {{due to the fact that}} full scale pile loading test cannot accommodate this case. Small Scale model frame apparatus furnished with high accuracy instrumentations has been set up at Kuittho, a series of different <b>pile</b> <b>weight</b> models, several tests and analysis of model to prototype similarity has been conducted. The conclusion reveals that the lighter pile exhibit additional significant capacity compare to the pile made from normal concrete weight, from this reasons, a lighter concrete pile as an alternative pile material can be developed to obtain the lightest pile as long as it complies with strength and stability requirements...|$|E
30|$|For pile {{properties}} category, {{previous studies}} only focused on 5 different parameters, where in ANN, 15 different parameters have been investigated. Parameters such as <b>pile</b> <b>weight</b> (Wp), amount of steel reinforcement (As), pile circumference (M), pile initial axial capacity (P), and pile–soil interface friction angle (δ) {{has not been}} investigated by GP. For hammer SPT/CPT information, ANN covered 9 parameters where GP only have covered 6 parameters. Hammer drop height (Hh), number of blows (N), and hammer weight (Wh) are parameters that are investigated in ANN but not covered by GP in previous studies. In soil properties, ANN was more developed where 11 parameters have been investigated in the literature; however, only three parameters {{have been used for}} GP. Hence, parameters such as effective soil specific weight (γe), soil friction angle (φ), soil type around the pile shaft (Ts), and etc. can be used in future GP studies on piles. In loading history category, GP used different load parameters than ANN.|$|E
30|$|Compared to ANN, GP is a newer {{technique}} for artificial intelligence analysis of pile capacity. Among GP applications, pile length, pile diameter, and {{undrained shear strength}} at pile tip were the most applied variables. Similar to ANN, among the four main categories of variables, pile properties had {{the highest percentage of}} repeat; however, the percentage of using pile properties in ANN (52 %) was 16 % larger than its usage in GP (36 %). Specifically, for pile properties category, GP studies were only focused on 5 different variables, whereas in ANN, 14 different variables have been investigated. Parameters such as <b>pile</b> <b>weight</b> (Wp), amount of steel reinforcement (As), pile circumference (M), pile initial axial capacity (P), and pile–soil interface friction angle (δ) have not been investigated by GP. Overall, in the seven reviewed GP applications, only 18 different variables have been applied. Comparing this number with 38 applied variables in ANN applications shows that further studies are needed to explore more variables in GP.|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{method is}} presented for predicting the uplift resistance of deep piles with enlarged bases. The piles are {{deeply embedded in}} soil, so that an axisymmetric logarithmic-spiral (or 'peach-shaped') slip surface in the soil around the pile is buried underground throughout the uplifting process. The uplift resistance {{is considered to be}} equal to the sum of the pile shaft and base uplift resistance as well as the <b>pile</b> <b>weight.</b> The pile shaft and base uplift resistance were derived from the unit skin frictional resistance model and the peachshaped slip surface model in the soil around the base. The equations associated with the proposed theoretical method are analytically formulated using the classical limit equilibrium method and the axisymmetric pile uplift model. Three base uplift resistance capacity factors, Nc, Nq and Nγ, were obtained, corresponding to the effects of cohesion, surcharge and self-weight respectively. Charts of these three factors are presented at the serviceability failure limit (defined as pile upward displacement equal to 10 % of the pile shaft diameter). The proposed theoretical method is then validated with results from full-scale field tests. It is shown that the proposed theoretical method can effectively estimate the uplift resistance capacity at the serviceability failure limit for deep piles with enlarged bases in various soils. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the influence of the structural components, the mechanical wear and the environmental conditions on the mechanical behaviour of third generation artificial turf football fields. Twenty-three football specimens of artificial turf were evaluated according to the standards of quality established by the FIFA Quality Programme for football turf (laboratory test). Mechanical properties were analysed according to moisture, temperature and wear conditions. The structural variables used were: carpet mass sample (g/m 2), <b>pile</b> <b>weight</b> (g/m 2), tuft m 2 sample (tuft/m 2), pile length sample (mm), pile yarn dtex sample (g/ 10, 000 m), infill bulk density sample (g/cm 3), stabilizing bulk density sample (g/cm 3), incorporation of elastic layer. Temperature, in opposite of wear conditions, did not significantly alter the mechanical behaviour of the surface, although humidity reduced the absorption capacity of the artificial turf within the regulatory limits. The characteristics of the structural components can explain up to 78. 1 % {{of the variance in the}} mechanical behaviour of the surface. Therefore, the control and maintenance of the structural components is necessary for guaranteeing a safe and functional mechanical behaviour of the artificial turf surface.

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} time, cost and transportation difficulties, Irish contractors are seeking {{an alternative to}} conventional static pile load tests. As a result several firms have adopted dynamic testing techniques to supplement {{and in some cases}} to replace conventional static tests. In order to assess the reliability of the systems and to address the concerns of owners and consulting engineers, a database comprising 43 pairs of static and dynamic tests on piles from 24 sites around Ireland has been assembled. The database was limited to medium to large diameter continuous flight auger (CFA) piles, typically 450 mm to 600 mm in diameter. Comparisons between actual measured settlement in static tests and predicted settlement for dynamic tests showed a clear pattern of underestimation of settlement by the dynamic tests, with the ratio between the two values typically varying between 0. 4 and 1. 2, with an average of about 0. 8. This is due to the limited energy being imparted to the pile in the dynamic test. The results were best for piles in rock and worst for piles in clay. Scatter in the results increased with increasing pile load. However as all of the measured settlements were modest, the absolute numerical difference between the actual and predicted values was typically less than 3 mm, which may not be significant in many practical cases. For piles supporting non - sensitive structures, in areas where the ground conditions are well know, and provided the ratio the drop weight to the <b>pile</b> <b>weight</b> and to the pile SWL is at least 50 % and 1. 5 % respectively, it seems possible that static tests can be replaced by dynamic ones. However for structures sensitive to settlement or for those in areas where ground conditions are uncertain, then it is suggested that the dynamic test should be calibrated by at least one static test...|$|E

40|$|Small scale {{physical}} modelling have {{been dominated by}} enhanced gravity modelling with centrifuge equipments. However due to its high cost and capital intensive, {{attempts were made to}} find another method with normal gravity simulation. This study was focused on clay soil dealing with finding a suitable representation to soil model. In line with the problem currently faced to reduce the cost of pile foundation in soft soil, the test case of pile loading tests (PLT) was chosen for investigation in normal gravity scaled modelling, full scale testing as well as in numerical modelling. Normal Concrete Pile (NCP), Palm Oil Concrete Pile (POCP) and Foamed Concrete Pile (FCP) were observed in Pile Loading Test (PLT) to study the feasibility of using light <b>weight</b> concrete <b>piles</b> (LCP) for deep foundations on soft soil. The PLT of various <b>pile</b> <b>weights</b> in normal gravity small scale model was previously conducted to represent the behavior of NCP, POCP and FCP. The results show that the FCP (26 kN) has about 30 % higher capacity than NCP (20 kN). This is due to the lower unit weight and stiffness of the pile. The results of ultimate capacity of each pile type were also in good agreement to the pile model, indicating that the attempt to set up normal gravity small scale modeling was satisfactory. To obtain the stresses along the pile, the piles in full scale prototype were also tested under dynamic loading. The compression stresses and tensile stresses measured from PDA test were under tolerable limit of their strength (the compression stress and compression strength of FCP were 10. 4 MPa and 15 MPa and for POCP were 4. 8 MPa and 25 MPa respectively. Whereas the tensile stress and tensile strength of FCP were 1. 2 MPa and 1. 2 MPa and for POCP were 10. 4 MPa and 15 MPa respectively). As with normal piles these piles also experienced severe stresses, without any crack or damage during transportation, handling and driving. This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} use of LCPs as pile foundation of particular structures in soft soils is feasible...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the wear of artificial sports pitch materials and characterise the wear mechanisms. The project was in collaboration with Notts Sports Ltd. who wished to compare the performance of existing pitches with potential new, improved artificial sports turfs. The various materials (from different manufacturers, and of differing <b>pile</b> yarn <b>weight</b> and worn in situ and new) were imaged by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to assess the tribological behaviour of the artificial sports turfs. X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was used to assess the structure of the artificial sports turfs. Pin on disk wear testing, tensile and fatigue testing was conducted on the artificial sports turfs to assess the wear life/mechanisms and how the structure performs under loading. Optical and scanning electron microscopy reveal the wear mechanisms can be identified by the damage incurred as either adhesive, or abrasive or both. Additionally a directionality in the mechanical properties of the materials was observed. Visual and structural investigation by X-ray CT revealed a directionality to the materials. X-ray CT also showed inconsistencies in the structure negatively affect the performance of the artificial sports turfs, which was seen to be the case with some tensile and fatigue experiments. MRI was explored but found not useful in assessing the structure of the artificial sports turfs. Wear testing showed different behaviour for differing artificial sports turfs, whilst the tensile and fatigue testing showed the orientation of the samples affects these properties, in that the horizontal orientation was stronger than vertical orientation. Tensile testing revealed the artificial sports turfs behave similarly to randomly orientated short fibre composites.

However, ANN deficiencies in finding global minima {{as well as its}} slow rate of convergence are the major drawbacks of implementing this technique. The current study aimed at developing an ANN-based predictive model enhanced with genetic algorithm (GA) optimization technique to predict the bearing capacity of piles. To provide necessary dataset required for establishing the model, 50 dynamic load tests were conducted on precast concrete piles in Pekanbaru, Indonesia. The pile geometrical properties, <b>pile</b> set, hammer <b>weight</b> and drop height were set to be the network inputs and the pile ultimate bearing capacity was set to be the output of the GA-based ANN model.

Results indicate that the pile bearing capacities predicted by GA-based ANN are in close agreement with measured bearing capacities.
