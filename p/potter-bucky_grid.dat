30|$|In a {{historical}} context, conventional skull x-rays {{have been most}} instrumental in identifying brain stones. The use of various projections has helped localise brain stones and, in some instances, narrow the differential diagnosis [6, 8, 9]. The introduction of the <b>Potter-Bucky</b> <b>grid</b> in the 1920 s further increased the detection rate of skull x-rays [5]. CT (and especially the multidetector CTs), because of their multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) and 3 D reconstruction capabilities, have supplanted the use of skull x-rays in the diagnosis of intracranial pathology. They are also considered {{to be better than}} magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in identifying and characterising intracranial calcification [4, 10], although newer MRI sequences such as gradient echo T 2 * and susceptibility-weighted imaging {{have been shown to be}} promising in detecting intracranial calcification [11 – 13]. In certain clinical situations, neurological symptoms have even been shown to correlate better with MRI findings than with the corresponding CT-identified calcifications [14 – 16].|$|E
40|$|Computed {{radiography}} (CR) {{has many}} advantages such as filmless operations, efficiency, and convenience. Furthermore, {{it is easier}} to integrate with the picture archiving and communication systems. Another important advantage is that CR images generally have a wider dynamic range than conventional screen film. Unfortunately, grid artifacts and moiré pattern artifacts may be present in CR images. These artifacts become a more serious problem when viewing CR images on a computer monitor when a clinic grade monitor is not available. Images produced using a grid with higher frequency or a <b>Potter–Bucky</b> <b>grid</b> (i. e., a moving grid, Bucky for short) can reduce occurrence but cannot guarantee elimination of these artifacts [CR & PACS (2000); Detrick F (2001), pp 7 – 8]. In this paper, the formation of the artifacts is studied. We show that the grid artifacts occur in a narrow band of frequency in the frequency domain. The frequency can be determined, accurately located, and thus removed from the frequency domain. When comparing the results obtained from the proposed method against the results obtained using previous computer methods, we show that our method can achieve better image quality...|$|E
