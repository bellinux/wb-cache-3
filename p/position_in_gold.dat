(Et 2 L) CuCl shows the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in the series, 70 %.

Monomeric (Me 2 L) CuNCS is a white emitter, while dimeric [(Et 2 L) Cu(µ-NCS) ] 2 shows intense yellow emission with a PLQY of 49 %.

In athletics, a three-way tie in the men's high jump, and ties in the men's 3,000m steeplechase and the women's high jump for second place meant that no bronzes were awarded for those events.

40|$|Knowledge {{of thermal}} history in {{biological}} tissues during laser based hyperthermia {{is essential to}} achieve necrosis of tumour orcarcinoma cells. A semi analytical model to predict sub surface thermal history in translucent, soft, bio tissue mimics has been proposed. The model can accurately predict the spatio temporal temperature variations along depth and the anomalous thermal behaviour in such media, viz. occurrence of sub surface temperature peaks. Based on opto thermal properties, the augmented temperature and shift of the peak <b>positions</b> <b>in</b> case of <b>gold</b> nanostructure mediated tissue phantom hyperthermia can be predicted. Employing inverse approach, the absorbance coefficient of nano graphene infused tissue mimics is determined from the peak temperature and found to provide appreciably accurate predictions along depth. Furthermore, a simplistic, dimensionally consistent correlation to theoretically determine {{the position of the}} peak in such media is proposed and found to be consistent with experiments and computations. The model shows promise in predicting thermal history in optically active soft matter and deduction of therapeutic hyperthermia parameters, thereby providing a priori estimates for clinical trials.
