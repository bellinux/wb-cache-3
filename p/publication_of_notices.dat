40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Defense (DOD) class justifications included in GAO's sample were used primarily for the acquisition of weapon systems or related subsystems and components. About 77 percent covered specific weapon system development, production, sustainment, or modernization efforts; about 14 percent covered logistics support of multiple weapon systems or training systems; and the remaining 9 percent covered other requirements. Because weapon systems are typically used for many years, DOD officials told GAO class justifications provided an administrative efficiency by allowing one justification for multiple contracts that would essentially require the same justification. Most of the class justifications in GAO's sample had a total value of over $ 85. 5 million and required approval {{at the highest level}} [...] the senior procurement executive of the DOD component. About 90 percent of the class justifications in GAO's sample cited only one responsible source to meet the requirements, generally because the contractor's ownership of proprietary technical data or expertise prevented the ability to compete the contract. The class justifications GAO reviewed generally cited the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>notices</b> of proposed contract actions on the Federal Business Opportunities website or market research to identify other qualified sources, neither of which identified other contractors that could meet the requirements. About 17 percent of the class justifications identified plans to compete future requirements. For example, three cited plans to acquire technical data to enable future competition and two cited efforts to break out some portion of the requirement for competition. ...|$|E

5000|$|Agency {{actions are}} divided into two broad {{categories}} discussed above, rulemaking and adjudication.
