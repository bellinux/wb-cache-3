40|$|Between 1985 and 1987, a {{community-based}} case-management programme for acute lower {{respiratory infection}} (ALRI) {{was conducted in}} a rural district of northern Pakistan. The impact on infant and child mortality of this programme, which included active case-finding and maternal health education, was evaluated. In 1985 - 86, the ALRI-specific mortality rate among children less than 5 years old in 31 intervention villages was 6. 3 deaths <b>per</b> 1000 <b>children</b> <b>per</b> year, compared with 14. 4 in seven control villages (P = 0. 0001). Within one year of the interventions being extended to the control villages in 1987, the ALRI-specific mortality rate in these villages dropped by 55 % to 6. 5 <b>per</b> 1000 <b>children</b> <b>per</b> year (P = 0. 06). The total child mortality rate in 1985 - 86 was 29. 0 <b>per</b> 1000 <b>children</b> <b>per</b> year in the intervention villages and 39. 4 <b>per</b> 1000 <b>children</b> in the control villages, a difference of 26 % (P = 0. 01).

Similar intervention-associated declines in the infant mortality rate were also observed. Case management of acute respiratory infection by village-level community health workers backed up by local health centre staff appeared to significantly reduce both ALRI-specific and total infant and child mortality rates in this setting...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Information on the {{incidence}} of serious infections in children in general practice is scarce. However, estimates on {{the incidence}} of disease are important for several reasons, for example to assess the burden of disease or as a basis of diagnostic research. We therefore estimated {{the incidence of}} serious infections in general practice in Belgium. Methods Intego is a morbidity registration network, in which 51 general practitioners continuously register all diagnoses and additional data in their electronic medical records. Serious infections were defined as pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis, pyelonephritis and osteomyelitis. Incidences are calculated {{for the period of}} 1998 to 2002, per 1000 patients in the yearly contact group, which is the group of patients that consulted their GP at least once that year, and in the practice population, which is the estimated true population of that practice. Results The incidence of all infectious diseases peaks in children between 0 and 4 years, with 1731 infections <b>per</b> 1000 <b>children</b> <b>per</b> year in the yearly contact group. Incidence drops with increasing age: 972 infections <b>per</b> 1000 <b>children</b> <b>per</b> year in <b>children</b> between 5 and 9 years old, and 732 in children between 10 and 14 years old. The same decline in incidence is observed in the subgroup of serious infections: 21 infections <b>per</b> 1000 <b>children</b> <b>per</b> year in <b>children</b> between 0 and 4 years, 12 in children between 5 and 9 years and 5 in children between 10 and 14 years. The results for the estimated practice population are respectively 17, 9 and 4 serious infections <b>per</b> 1000 <b>children</b> <b>per</b> year. Conclusion In contrast to the total incidence of acute infections, serious infections are rare, around 1 % <b>per</b> year. <b>Children</b> younger than 4 years old have the highest risk for serious infections, and incidences of some infections are different for boys and girls. </p...|$|R
