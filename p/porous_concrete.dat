5|$|By 1983, {{concerns}} {{with the leadership}} of the Battleship Texas Commission led to the decision by the State Legislature to turn over control of the ship to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD). The legislature abolished the commission effective 31 August 1983, and TPWD assumed operational control the next day. One of the first actions by TPWD was to hire a firm of naval architects to survey the ship in order to assess the deterioration and make recommendations as to what actions should be taken to preserve the ship. The survey revealed that the ship's watertight integrity was badly compromised, the hull was open to the sea in many places, and many compartments were full of standing rain water. The architects determined that the ship needed to go to dry dock for major repairs to the hull and to keep rain water from coming through the <b>porous</b> <b>concrete</b> deck. As part of this plan, serious consideration was given to protecting sensitive fabrics and restoring the interior of the ship. After a five-year-long fund-raising campaign, $15 million was collected to dry dock the ship and complete necessary repairs.|$|E
25|$|Porous paving (or {{pervious}} paving) is {{an alternative}} to conventional impermeable pavement and allows infiltration of runoff water to the soil or to a dedicated water storage reservoir below it In reasonably flat areas such as car parks, driveways and lightly used roads, it decreases the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff and can improve water quality by removing contaminants through filtering, interception and biological treatment. Porous pavements can have several forms and are either monolithic or modular. Monolithic structures consist of a single continuous porous medium such as <b>porous</b> <b>concrete</b> or porous pavement (asphalt) while modular structures include porous pavers individual paving blocks that are constructed {{so that there is}} a gap in between each paver. Commercial products that are available are for example, pavements made from special asphalt or concrete containing minimal materials, concrete grid pavements, and concrete ceramic or plastic modular pavements. Porous pavements are usually laid on a very porous material (sand or gravel), underlain by a layer of geotextile material. Maintenance activities vary {{depending on the type of}} porous pavement. Generally, inspections and removal of sediment and debris should be undertaken. Modulate pavers can also be lifted, backwashed and replaced when blockages occurs. Generally porous pavement is not suited for areas with heavy traffic loads. Particulates in stormwater can clog pores in the material.|$|E

This study considered the use of reinforcing fiber and styrene butadiene (SB) latex to improve the strength of <b>porous</b> vegetation <b>concrete,</b> as well as the use of blast furnace slag aggregate to improve the CO 2 emissions-reducing effect, and analyzed and evaluated the influence of fiber reinforcing, SB latex, and blast furnace slag aggregate on the compressive strength and CO 2 emissions of <b>porous</b> vegetation <b>concrete.</b> The CO 2 emissions of the raw materials were highest for cement, followed by aggregate, SB latex, and fiber. Blast furnace slag aggregate showed a 30 % or more CO 2 emissions-reducing effect versus crushed aggregate, and blast furnace slag cement showed a 78 % CO 2 emissions-reducing effect versus Portland cement. The CO 2 emissions analyses for each raw material showed that the CO 2 emissions during transportation were highest for the aggregate.

40|$|Porous asphalt shows {{excellent}} {{performance in}} both noise reduction and water drainage. Although porous asphalt has these great qualities, its service life is much shorter (sometimes only half) compared to dense graded asphalt roads. Ravelling, {{which is the}} loss of aggregate particles from the surface layer, is the main damage mechanism of porous asphalt surface wearing courses. In this research, an induction healing approach (namely, activating the healing process of asphalt concrete through induction heating) was developed to enhance the durability of the porous asphalt roads. Steel fibers are added to a porous asphalt mixture to make it electrically conductive and suitable for induction heating. When micro cracks are expected to occur in the asphalt mastic of the pavement, the temperature of the mastic can be increased locally by induction heating of the steel fibers so that <b>porous</b> asphalt <b>concrete</b> can repair itself and close the cracks through the high temperature healing of the bitumen (diffusion and flow). The closure of micro cracks will prevent the formation of macro cracks. In such a way, ravelling can be avoided or delayed in the end. To make asphalt mastic and <b>porous</b> asphalt <b>concrete</b> electrically conductive and suitable for induction heating, steel (wool) fibers were incorporated into them. The electrical conductivity and induction heating speed of asphalt mastic and <b>porous</b> asphalt <b>concrete</b> were first studied in this research. Asphalt mastic and <b>porous</b> asphalt <b>concrete</b> with steel fibers can be heated with induction energy. There is an optimal volume content of steel fiber in asphalt mastic or <b>porous</b> asphalt <b>concrete</b> to obtain the highest induction heating speed. Adding more steel fiber above this optimal volume content does not increase the induction heating speed anymore. Furthermore, the highest induction heating speed corresponds to the minimum electrical resistivity. However, <b>porous</b> asphalt <b>concrete</b> {{does not need to be}} fully conductive for induction heating. Every single steel wool is a heating unit. Nonconductive samples with steel fiber can still be heated with induction heating, but at a low heating speed. The diameter, length and content of steel wool fiber are important for the conductivity and heating speed of asphalt concrete matrix. It is proven that induction heating does not cause extra ageing to bitumen. Addition of steel wool also reduces the binder drainage problem in <b>porous</b> asphalt <b>concrete.</b> The mechanical properties of <b>porous</b> asphalt <b>concrete</b> with steel wool fiber were studied in this research. Adding moderate percentage steel wool to <b>porous</b> asphalt <b>concrete</b> reinforce it by increasing its particle loss resistance, indirect tensile strength and fracture energy, water damage resistance, stiffness and fatigue resistance. The steel wool was optimized to obtain the best particle loss resistance in <b>porous</b> asphalt <b>concrete.</b> 8 % steel wool type 00 (volume fraction of bitumen) was considered as the optimal content. The healing potential of <b>porous</b> asphalt <b>concrete</b> with steel wool fiber was also evaluated in this research with both cylinder and beam samples. Damaged <b>porous</b> asphalt <b>concrete</b> with steel wool fiber can greatly restore its stiffness, strength and fatigue life with induction heating, which proves that the healing capacity of <b>porous</b> asphalt <b>concrete</b> with steel wool fiber is enhanced by induction heating. The optimal induction heating temperature is 85 ºC for <b>porous</b> asphalt <b>concrete</b> to obtain the best healing rate. Reheating does not decrease the healing rate of <b>porous</b> asphalt <b>concrete,</b> which means that heating can be repeated when cracks appear again. To apply the induction healing technology in real porous asphalt road, a trial section was constructed on Dutch motorway A 58 in December 2010. This trial section survived the past two winters perfectly. Experiments were done on the cores drilled from the trial section and the results coincided with those on the laboratory made samples. The field cores showed good particle loss resistance, high strength, good fatigue resistance and high induction healing capacity. Based on the laboratory experiments and field experiences, induction healing can be a very good approach to enhance the durability of porous asphalt pavement. Finally, some recommendations are given for further research. Steel fiber, mixing technology and induction generator need to be optimized. Modeling work is necessary to fully understand the mechanisms involved in induction healing. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

The objective of this research is to predict the sound absorption coefficient for a three-dimensional porous structure. The proposed solution is obtained using a novel modeling approach, in which the total solution of the sound field is found by combining the solutions of two subsystems: a background sound field and a scattered sound field.

The modeling approach is validated for normal incident plane waves absorbed and scattered by various structures of stacked marbles, using the impedance tube technique.

The level of the noise is influenced by traffic density and traffic composition, as well as vehicle speed and the type of surface. The article presents the results of studies on tire/road noise from passing vehicles at a speed of 40 – 80 kph, carried out by using the statistical pass-by method (SPB), on seven surfaces with different characteristics. It has been shown that increasing the speed from 40 kph to 50 kph contributes to the increase in the maximum A-weighted sound pressure level by about 3 dB, regardless of the type of surface. For larger differences in speed (30 kph– 40 kph) increase in noise levels reaches values about 10 dB. In the case of higher speeds, this increase is slightly lower.
