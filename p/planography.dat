It opened in 1935.It later provided treatment for people with other disorders, including physical and mental handicaps. In a 1953 article in the medical journal Chest, B.

5000|$|Le Zombie was an {{intermittent}} ("Published {{every time}} a zombie awakens") science fiction fanzine, of which 72 issues were published by science fiction fan and author Bob Tucker from December 1938 to August 2001. The first issue was a single, crudely mimeographed sheet; the last printed issue was published in December 1975 by <b>planography.</b> After a 25-year hiatus, Tucker resumed publishing in 2000; these last 5 issues (also referred to as eZombie, but preserving the same numbering sequence) were electronically published as a webzine. The title refers to the [...] "Tucker death hoaxes" [...] which played such a distinctive role in fan history.|$|E
50|$|Focal plane {{tomography}} {{was developed}} in the 1930s by the radiologist Alessandro Vallebona, and proved useful in reducing the problem of superimposition of structures in projectional radiography. In a 1953 article in the medical journal Chest, B. Pollak of the Fort William Sanatorium described the use of <b>planography,</b> another term for tomography. Focal plane tomography remained the conventional form of tomography until being largely replaced by mainly computed tomography the late-1970s. Focal plane tomography uses the fact that the focal plane appear sharper, while structures in other planes appear blurred. By moving an X-ray source and the film in opposite directions during the exposure, and modifying the direction and extent of the movement, operators can select different focal planes which contain the structures of interest.|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} survey and study by Twining 2 {{of the problem of}} {{visualization}} of the third and fourth ventricles, the conclusion was reached that, despite the numerous and complicated technics devised, the problem of adequate demonstration of the fourth ventricle by pneumography is unsolved. The present communication is a preliminary report on the use of <b>planography</b> for demonstrating the fourth ventricle. A more detailed study concerning the use of bodysection roentgenography in the visualization of the fourth ventricle and adjacent structures is in preparation at the present time. Case Report N. H. H. A 93, 274. The patient was a 47 -year-old man admitted to the hospital with the complaint of staggering gait and double vision, the latter having been present for over 10 years. He gave a history of ataxia, periodic headaches, dizziness, and paresthesias of the left upper lip, all of {{about a year and a}} half duration. About six months prior to admission he had developed a tight feeling in the head and had noted difficulty in cerebration. The patient was a well-developed white man who did not appear to be acutely ill. On examination there was general sluggish cerebration and slowness of response. The left pupil was found to be slightly larger than was the right, and there was minimal divergent strabismus. Full lateral gaze in either direction brought out a slight nystagmus. There was moderate ptosis of the left eyelid. The gait was definitely ataxic with a tendency to deviate to the right. There was only questionable weakness of the right upper extremity. Roentgenographic examination of the skull disclosed slight increase in convolutional markings and some atrophy of the posterior clinoid processes and of the dorsum sellae. There was a suggestion of thinning of the roof of the left petrous apex. Because of the discrepancy between the severity of the subjective complaints and the positive findings on examination, ventriculography was done...|$|E
