40|$|Abstract — The faults {{that occur}} in the {{hardware}} implementations of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) may cause incorrect encrypted/decrypted output. The use of appropriate fault detection schemes for the AES makes it vigorous to inner defects as well as fault attacks. In our paper, we present a lightweight concurrent fault detection scheme for the AES. In the proposed approach, the composite field S-box and inverse S-box are divided into blocks and the <b>projected</b> <b>parities</b> of these blocks are obtained. Through exhaustive searches, we have found the optimum solutions for the least overhead parity-based fault detection structures. This is a low-cost parity-based fault detection scheme for the S-box and the inverse S-box using composite fields. For increasing the error coverage, the predicted parities of the five blocks of the S-box and the inverse S-box are got. The cost of our multi-bit parity prediction approach is lower than which use single-bit parity. It also has higher error coverages. We have implemented both the proposed fault detection S-box and inverse S- box and other Counter parts in Advanced Encryption Standard. The complexities of the proposed fault detection scheme are lower. Index Terms – AES, Composite fields, error-coverage, fault detectio...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Analysis of {{census data}} is {{important}} to uncover new insights as well as highlight where improvements in future data collection are required. The study provides {{an assessment of the}} fertility estimates derived from census data in comparison to those derived from the Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Surveys. Robust methods are used to estimate fertility levels and to identify the trends in fertility in Zimbabwe. Fertility decline in Zimbabwe is observed to have started in the early 1980 s. The greatest level of decline occurred between the 1980 s and the mid- 1990 s. In more recent years fertility in Zimbabwe has stalled at roughly four children per woman. Using <b>projected</b> <b>parity</b> progression ratios fertility decline has been observed to be in part a result of parity limitation, as fewer women progress to higher parities. A comparison of the census and Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey fertility measures show that for the same cohort of women, the measures of fertility are strongly congruent.

40|$|The study utilises four Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSS) {{conducted}} in 1988, 1994, 1999, and 2005 in Zimbabwe {{to examine the}} socioeconomic differentials in fertility over time. The period fertility (age-specific and total fertility) rates, cohort-period fertility rates (CPFRs), <b>projected</b> <b>parity</b> progression ratios (<b>projected</b> PPRs), and logistic regression methods {{are used in the}} analysis, overall, to assess the nature of fertility transition. All the measures of fertility indicate an ongoing fertility decline in Zimbabwe among all parities and age groups mainly {{as a result of an}} increase in modern contraceptive uptake. Overall, fertility decline has been much more rapidly in the in the 1980 decade and slowed since 1990. The analysis shows an inverse association between urban residence, education and economic status, measured by ownership of household assets, and fertility based on the total fertility (TFR), CPFRs and projected PPRs estimates. Further analysis of the net effects of economic status and education using multivariate logistic regressions suggests the odds of having a child (not having a child) decreases (increases) with economic status and education. Overall, even after controlling for various socioeconomic variables fertility decreases with a rising level in education and/or economic status...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{theoretical}} {{nuclear physics}} faces two major challenges. The first {{is finding a}} suitable interaction, which describes the forces between nucleons. The second challenge is {{the solution of the}} nuclear many-body problem for a given nucleus while applying a realistic potential. The potential used in the framework of this thesis is based on the Argonne AV 18 potential. It was transformed by means of the Unitary Correlation Operator Method (UCOM) to optimize convergence. The usual phenomenological corrections were applied to improve the potential for the Hilbert space used in Fermionic Molecular Dynamics (FMD). FMD is an approach to solve the nuclear many-body problem. It uses a single-particle basis which is a superposition of Gaussian distributions in phase-space. The most simple many-body state is the antisymmetric product of the single-particle states: a Slater determinant, the so called intrinsic state. This intrinsic state is <b>projected</b> on <b>parity,</b> total angular momentum and a center of mass momentum zero. The Hilbert space is spanned by several of these projected states. The states are obtained by minimizing their energy while demanding certain constraints. The expectation values of Slater determinants, <b>parity</b> <b>projected</b> and additionally total angular momentum projected Slater determinants are used. The states that are relevant in the low energy regime are obtained by diagonalization. The lowest moments of the mass-, proton- or neutron-distribution and the excitation in proton- and neutron-shells of a harmonic oscillator are some of the used constraints. The low energy regime of the Beryllium isotopes with masses 7 to 14 is calculated by using these states. Energies, radii, electromagnetic transitions, magnetic moments and point density distributions of the low lying states are calculated and are presented in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|Fermionic Molecular Dynamics (FMD) [1] is a {{microscopic}} many-body approach using Gaussian wave packets localized in phase-space as single-particle basis states. Slater determinants <b>projected</b> on <b>parity,</b> angular and total linear momentum {{are used as}} many-body basis states. The FMD basis is very flexible and contains harmonic oscillator shell model and Brink-type cluster wave functions as special cases. The widths of the wave packets are also variational parameters which is useful for the description of halo nuclei with extended single-particle wave functions. An effective interaction derived from the realistic Argonne V 18 interaction by explicitly including short-range central and tensor correlations in the Unitary Correlation Operator Method is used. A phenomenological two-body correction term is added which is fitted to binding energies and radii of closed-shell nuclei. In recent years it has become possible to measure the isotope shifts of short-lived nuclei. With that precise and model independent measurements of the charge radii are possible.

We discuss the fully microscopic calculation of the 3 He(alpha,gamma) 7 Be capture reaction within the FMD approach. The model space contains frozen cluster configurations at large distances and polarized configurations in the interaction region. The polarized configurations are essential for a successful description of the 7 Be bound state properties and for the S- and D-wave scattering states. The calculated cross section agrees well with recent measurements regarding both the absolute normalization and the energy dependence. We also discuss the structure of the cluster states, including the famous Hoyle state, in 12 C. From the two-body densities we conclude that the Hoyle state has a spatially extended triangular alpha-cluster structure, whereas the third 0 + state features a chain-like obtuse triangle structure. We also calculate the N hbar Omega decomposition of our wave functions to illuminate the challenges of no-core shell model calculations for these cluster states.

It is shown that while at T= 0 there is always entanglement between any two spins in a narrow field interval before the transition to the aligned state, at low but non-zero temperatures the entanglement remains non-zero for arbitrarily high fields, for any pair separation L, although its magnitude decreases exponentially with the field. It is also demonstrated that all associated limit temperatures approach a constant non-zero value in this limit, which decreases as 1 /L^ 2 for L<<n but exhibit special finite size effects for distant qubits (L approx. n/ 2). Related aspects such as the different behavior of even and odd antiferromagnetic chains, the existence of n ground state transitions and the thermodynamic limit are also discussed.

40|$|The nucleon and its negative-parity excited {{states are}} {{examined}} in a maximum entropy method analysis of QCD sum rules. First, we rederive the <b>parity</b> <b>projected</b> sum rules for baryons using forward correlation functions. Doing this, {{the method is}} generalized so that higher order operator product expansion (OPE) terms can be calculated unambiguously. We then apply this approach to the nucleon channel taking into account all known first order alpha_s corrections to the Wilson coefficients of the OPE. As these corrections {{have turned out to}} be large, we suppress them by using a phase-rotated Gaussian kernel. Simultaneously, this phase rotation strongly suppresses the continuum contribution and improves the convergence of the OPE. The resulting sum rule has the interesting feature that it is dominated by the term containing the chiral condensate of dimension 3. Analyzing this sum rule by the maximum entropy method, we are able to extract information of both the positive and negative parity states.

One would protect a plaintext P by concatenating it with false messages, "decoys", D = d 1, d 2, [...] . dm- 1 : to construct a Pre-Transposition Plaintext (PTP) : P, d 1, d 2, [...] . dm- 1.

The intended recipient, aware {{of the value of}} the key, k, used to generate C, would decrypt C to P, d 1, d 2, [...] . dm- 1, and dismiss the decoys. A cryptanalyst will identify at least m keys, one decrypting C to P, d 1, d 2, [...] . dm- 1, and at least (m- 1) others, decrypting C to various permutations, like: di, dj,dl, P, dt [...] , and will go no further, because C <b>projects</b> mathematical <b>parity</b> towards these m plausible candidates for the actual message sent. We show that in real life situations when both sides can reasonably prepare a list of plausible plaintexts, the UTC equals the mathematical security offered by Vernam's One-Time-Pad, albeit, without Vernam's key size inconvenience. UTC decoys may be constructed manually or with AI. Applying a UTC protection before further encrypting with any common cipher will add a new dimension of equivocation (a clear entropic advantage) to the prevailing intractability-only protection. An example for an actual UTC is referenced and described. ...|$|R

In recent years the cross section has been remeasured in a great effort in several experiments at the Weizmann institute, by the LUNA Collaboration, by the Seattle group and by the ERNA Collaboration now providing high quality data. Nevertheless it is still necessary to extrapolate the measured cross sections down to the energies relevant in solar burning. There have been many attempts to calculate the cross section, using an external capture picture, using potential models where the system is modeled by two pointlike clusters interacting via an effective nucleus-nucleus potential and using microscopic cluster models employing effective nucleon-nucleon interactions. None of this calculations is able to describe the experimental data. In Ref. [1] we presented the first ab initio type calculation for this reaction. We use a realistic effective nucleonnucleon interaction that is derived in the UCOM(SRG) approach [2].

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of Fermionic Molecular Dynamics a method is developed to better account for long range tensor correlations in nuclei when working with a single Slater determinant.

The realistic Argonne V 18 potential is used and short range correlations are treated with the Unitary Correlation Operator Method. Comparison with exact few-body calculations shows that in $^ 4 $He about one fifth of the correlation energy due to long-range correlations are accounted for. These correlations which extend over the whole nucleus are visualized with the isospin and spin-isospin density of the intrinsic state. The divergence of the spin-isospin density, the source for pion fields, turns out to be of dipole nature. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|In the Fermionic Molecular Dynamics (FMD) {{approach}} [1] nuclei {{are described}} using Gaussian wave-packets as single-particle states.

The widths of the wavepackets are variational parameters which together with the possibility to superimpose two wave-packets in a singleparticle states allows a successful description of extended halo states. An effective Hamiltonian derived from the realistice Argonne V 18 interaction within the Unitary Correlation Operator Method (UCOM) is used for all nuclei. Recent measurements of the charge radii of the Neon isotopes 17 − 22 Ne by the COLLAPS group at ISOLDE triggered {{a study of the}} properties of these nuclei in the FMD approach and resulted in a joint publication [2]. Of particular interest here was the structure of 17 Ne. Whereas three-body cluster calculations found large s 2 components and therefore a halo-like structure, shell model calculations based on Coulomb displacement energies and magnetic moments predicted a small s 2 component. FMD configurations for the neon isotopes were obtained in a variation after parity projection procedure. For 17, 18 Ne two minima were found which are essentially 15, 16 O cores plus two protons in either s 2 or d 2 configurations. Because of the missing centrifugal barrier the s-orbits are much more extended. A large s 2 component in the ground state wave function is therefore related to a large charge radius.

These techniques were fully tested for the sd-shell nuclei and some light f p-shell nuclei, by comparing with the level density obtained from exact shell model diagonalization. Here we present for the first time comparisons with the exact shell model diagonalization for nuclei heavier than 56 Ni, in a model space spanned by the f 5 / 2, p 3 / 2, p 1 / 2 and g 9 / 2 orbits.

40|$|Density dependences of {{the mass}} and self-energies of Λ_c in nulear matter are studied in the <b>parity</b> <b>projected</b> QCD sum rule. Effects of nuclear matter {{are taken into account}} through the quark and gluon condensates. It is found that the four-quark condensates give {{dominant}} contributions. As the density dependences of the four-quark condensates are not known well, we examine two hypotheses. One is based on the factorization hypothesis (F-type) and the other is derived from the perturbative chiral quark model (QM-type). The F-type strongly depends on density, while the QM-type gives a weaker dependence. It is found that, for the F-type dependence, the energy of Λ_c increases as the density of nuclear matter grows, that is, Λ_c feels repulsion. On the other hand, the QM-type predicts a weak attraction (∼ 20 MeV at the normal nuclear density) for Λ_c in nuclear matter. We carry out a similar analysis of the Λ hyperon and find that the F-type density dependence is too strong to explain the observed binding energy of Λ in nuclei. Thus we conclude that the weak density dependence of the four-quark condensate is more realistic. The scalar and vector self-energies of Λ_c for the QM-type dependence are found to be much smaller than those of the light baryons. Comment: 14 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, published versio...|$|R

Both octet and decuplet baryon states are studied via the conventional sum rule method {{and the new}} parity-projected sum rule method. Firstly, the low-lying N * channels of octets are studied via the conventional sum rule method. Using generalized interpolating fields, three independent sets of QCD sum rules are derived which allow the extraction of the spin 1 2 ±, and 3 2 ± states in both the non-strange and strange channels. Thereafter, we explored a new technique which exactly <b>projects</b> out the <b>parities</b> that are mixed in the conventional sum rules. One advantage of the new parity- project sum rules {{is to be able}} to study the origin of mass splittings between positive and negative-parity baryon pairs in a direct manner in relation to the chiral-symmetry breaking of QCD as manifested via the vacuum condensates. At last, we re-visited the spin 3 2 ± decuplet states in both the conventional and the parity-projected QCD sum rule methods. These states have not been well-studied in this context in the literature.

A D-brane forms an U(1) gauge group and the group structure can be enriched by Chan-Paton indices with multiple coincided D-branes and orientifold ac- tions.
