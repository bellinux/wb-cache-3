40|$|A single {{analytical}} procedure is presented for determination of so-called monomeric <b>plasticisers</b> such as di(2 -ethylhexyl) adipate, polymeric <b>plasticisers</b> such as poly(butylene adipate), and secondary <b>plasticisers</b> such as epoxidised soybean oil.

Ester linkages are cleaved by treatment with potassium hydroxide in ethanol, epoxide moieties are opened using hydrochloric acid generated in situ by addition of acetyl chloride and, lastly, hydroxy groups are converted to silyl ethers using bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide. This reaction sequence is conveniently performed sequentially on a single sample leading to products that {{can be measured in}} a single GC analysis. The method has been applied to samples of known provenance and in a large survey of retail stretch-type films. The combined method offers significant savings in time compared with the separate analytical methods published earlier for monomeric and polymeric poly(vinyl chloride) <b>plasticisers.</b> The method is quantitative and gives results in good agreement with these earlier procedures. © 1994...|$|R

To overcome this problem, a second part of this work was focused on the use of a specific highly reactive vegetable tung oil. The in situ polymerisation of this oil by thermal activation without the use of catalysts allowed to totally prevent the exudation phenomenon by increasing the viscosity of the oil.

50|$|In May 2011, {{a scandal}} {{broke out in}} Taiwan when many drinks were found to contain DEHP, a <b>plasticiser</b> which was added as a {{clouding}} agent {{in order to improve}} the appearance of the drinks.

When the news spread to Hong Kong, this led to sharply-decreased sales for Taiwan-style drink shops; one Gong Cha branch in Causeway Bay reported a decrease in revenue of thirty percent. Gong Cha took a variety of actions to restore consumer confidence in the products, such as conducting tests on ingredients imported from Taiwan in order to prove their safety and in June 2011 discontinued certain kinds of juices in its Hong Kong branches before the test reports released.

40|$|Plasticised poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC-P) {{remains the}} most widely used blood-contacting biomaterial. With respect to the blood {{compatibility}} of PVC-P,the <b>plasticiser</b> plays a more important role than the PVC polymer itself, since the blood contacting surface is highly distributed with <b>plasticiser.</b> Therefore, the objective of this project was to study the significance of the <b>plasticiser</b> on protein adsorption onto PVC-P, where the features of <b>plasticiser</b> considered were <b>plasticiser</b> selection (nature of <b>plasticiser),</b> the <b>plasticiser</b> surface level and <b>plasticiser</b> surface distribution. To evaluate this, three types of medical grade PVC-P, plasticised with 2 -diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), tri-(2 -ethylhexyl) trimellitate (TEHTM) and n-butyryl-tri-n-hexyl citrate (BTHC) respectively in sheet form with the same softness, were selected. Protein adsorption was carried out using " 1 " 2 " 5 l-radiolabelled human fibrinogen and bovine serum albumin. The in vitro protein /material contact was achieved with a modified 24 -well incubation test cell. A reduced <b>plasticiser</b> surface level was obtained with methanol surface treatment. Surface characterisation was carried out using ATR-FTIR and UV-spectrophotometer. Results obtained indicate that fibrinogen adsorption on PVC-P strongly correlates with the <b>plasticiser</b> surface level. A reduced <b>plasticiser</b> level can reduce fibrinogen adsorption and increase albumin adsorption. However, excess surface washing might lead to a surface topographical change, initiating an increased fibrinogen adsorption. Protein adsorption is also dependent on the <b>plasticiser</b> nature and <b>plasticiser</b> surface distribution. A high level of <b>plasticiser</b> does not necessarily mean a high reactivity towards fibrinogen adsorption. Based on this study, surface modification of PVC-P was carried out using cyclodextrins (CDs) by blending. The combination of CDs with polyethylene oxide (PEO) or polyethylene (PEO) -poly(propylene oxide) (PRO) triblock copolymer (Pluronic surfactant) was also studied. Protein adsorption results indicate that the surface enriched CDs, CD/PEO, CD/Pluronic physical mixture or CD inclusion complex (CIC) can achieve a reduced protein adsorption. Finally, a possible mechanism was hypothesised and a proposal was made for a novel form of surface modification.
