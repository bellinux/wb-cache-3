25|$|The genus Exserohilum {{comprises}} dematiaceous fungi {{commonly associated}} with foliar plant diseases and rarely with human and animal phaeohyphomycosis. Fungi of this genus are characterized {{by the presence of}} melanin in their cell walls, which is thought to contribute to their virulence. Many Exserohilum species are plant pathogens that affect a wide range of plant species, especially grasses Poaceae, causing distinct leaf spots and blights. However, S. rostrata has also been shown to survive in human as well as animal hosts, indicating pathogenic versatility. Though E. rostratum is a rare cause of infection in people, the species can cause a spectrum of diseases including allergic fungal sinusitis, skin and subcutaneous infections, invasive disease and occasionally keratomycosis an inflammation of the cornea. Invasive and skin infections caused by Exserohilum occur more frequently in those that are immunodeficient or have impaired immunity, these include infections in the sinuses, lungs, lining of the heart, and bone. Whereas, local trauma is a <b>predisposing</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> skin and corneal infections. Meningitis and peripheral arthritides have also been reported pursuant to exposure to contaminated intrathecal drugs.|$|E

50|$|Osteoarthritis is {{the most}} common form of arthritis. It can affect both the larger and the smaller joints of the body, {{including}} the hands, wrists, feet, back, hip, and knee. The disease is essentially one acquired from daily wear and tear of the joint; however, osteoarthritis can also occur as a result of injury. In recent years, some joint or limb deformities, such as knock-knee or acetabular overcoverage or dysplasia, have also been considered as a <b>predisposing</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> knee or hip osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis begins in the cartilage and eventually causes the two opposing bones to erode into each other. The condition starts with minor pain during physical activity, but soon the pain can be continuous and even occur while in a state of rest. The pain can be debilitating and prevent one from doing some activities. Osteoarthritis typically affects the weight-bearing joints, such as the back, knee and hip. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis is most commonly a disease of the elderly. More than 30 percent of women have some degree of osteoarthritis by age 65. Risk factors for osteoarthritis include prior joint trauma, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle.|$|E

5000|$|There is a {{cultural}} emphasis on thinness which is especially pervasive in western society. There is an unrealistic stereotype of what constitutes beauty and the ideal body type as portrayed by the media, fashion and entertainment industries. [...] "The cultural pressure on {{men and women to}} be 'perfect' is an important <b>predisposing</b> <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> the development of eating disorders". Further, when women of all races base their evaluation of their self upon what is considered the culturally ideal body, the incidence of eating disorders increases. Eating disorders are becoming more prevalent in non-Western countries where thinness is not seen as the ideal, showing that social and cultural pressures are not the only causes of eating disorders. For example, observations of anorexia in all of the non-Western regions of the world point to the disorder not being [...] "culture-bound" [...] as once thought. However, studies on rates of bulimia suggest that it might be culturally bound. In non-Western countries, bulimia is less prevalent than anorexia, but these non-Western countries where it is observed can be said to have probably or definitely been influenced or exposed to Western culture and ideology.|$|E
