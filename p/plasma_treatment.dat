40|$|The {{sand-blasting}} {{and acid}} etching (SLA) method can fabricate a rough topography for mechanical fixation and long-term stability of titanium implant, {{but can not}} achieve early bone healing. This study used two kinds of <b>plasma</b> <b>treatments</b> (Direct-Current and Radio-Frequency plasma) to modify the SLA-treated surface. The modification of <b>plasma</b> <b>treatments</b> creates respective power range and different content functional OH groups. The {{results show that the}} <b>plasma</b> <b>treatments</b> do not change the micron scale topography, and plasma-treated specimens presented super hydrophilicity. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) -examined result showed that the functional OH content of the RF plasma-treated group was higher than the control (SLA) and DC treatment groups. The biological responses (protein adsorption, cell attachment, cell proliferation, and differentiation) promoted after <b>plasma</b> <b>treatments,</b> and the cell responses, have correlated to the total content of amphoteric OH groups. The experimental results indicated that <b>plasma</b> <b>treatments</b> can create functional OH groups on SLA-treated specimens, and the RF plasma-treated SLA implant thus has potential for achievement of bone healing in early stage of implantation...|$|R

The red shift of UV peak by 20 - 30 meV in PL spectra after <b>plasma</b> <b>treatments</b> is identified, which indicates that there are changes in the binding energy of bound exciton and/or the movement of energy levels of lattice defects and impurities. The width of UV peak is decreased after <b>plasma</b> <b>treatments,</b> which {{is believed to be}} closely related to the crystal quality of ZnO film. The increase of UV peak intensity after H-plasma treatment is also observed, and this could mean that the radiative recombination is strengthened because the hydrogen atoms in the plasma diffuse into the film where they passivate and neutralize the defects and the impurities...|$|R

With <b>plasma</b> <b>treatments,</b> especially H- 2 /NH 3 two-step plasma, a carbon-depletion region of about 30 non thick with more Si-O related bonds of high binding energy formed at the interface.
