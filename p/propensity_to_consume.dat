He focused on monetary expansion as a means of helping to create full employment. He was also aware of the relevance of forced saving, <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume,</b> the saving-investment relationship, and other matters that form the content of modern income and employment analysis. His monetary view was close to the fundamental concepts employed in his model of utilitarian decision making. His work is considered to be an early precursor of modern welfare economics.|$|E
2500|$|Islamist leader Abul A'la Maududi {{states that}} the {{charging}} interest on loans causes an imbalance between production and consumption, by the transferring of purchasing power from those with a <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume</b> to those with a propensity to invest. This transfer of income increases production and decreases consumption which (somehow) increases prices of consumer goods, reinforcing this process which (Maududi believes) results in economic evils such as stagnation, depression, monopoly and ultimately imperialism. Eliminating return on capital with interest-free loans along with zakat, and profit-share would restore this balance. The focus shifts to the entrepreneur whose activity becomes {{the only source of}} income along with wages, giving him the upper hand in society.

50|$|Critics of the Keynesian {{approach}} to macroeconomics soon {{pointed out that}} some of Keynes' assumptions were inconsistent with standard microeconomics.

For this reason, many empirical studieshave attempted to measure the marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume</b> (Barro, 1993, Ch. 3, p. 87), and macroeconomistshave also studied alternative microeconomic models (such as models of credit market imperfections and precautionary saving)that might imply a higher marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume.</b>|$|E
50|$|In economics, the {{marginal}} <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume</b> (MPC) is a metric that quantifies induced consumption, {{the concept that}} the increase in personal consumer spending (consumption) occurs with an increase in disposable income (income after taxes and transfers). The proportion of disposable income which individuals spend on consumption is known as <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume.</b> MPC is the proportion of additional income that an individual consumes. For example, if a household earns one extra dollar of disposable income, and {{the marginal}} <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume</b> is 0.65, then of that dollar, the household will spend 65 cents and save 35 cents.

40|$|A {{wide body}} of {{empirical}} evidence finds that around 25 percent of fiscal stimulus payments (e. g., tax rebates) are spent on nondurable household {{consumption in the}} quarter that they are received. To interpret this fact, we develop a structural economic model where households can hold two assets: a low-return liquid asset (e. g., cash, checking account) and a high-return illiquid asset that carries a transaction cost (e. g., housing, retirement account). The optimal life-cycle pattern of portfolio choice implies that many households in the model are "wealthy hand-to-mouth": they hold little or no liquid wealth despite owning sizeable quantities of illiquid assets. They therefore display large <b>propensities</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume</b> out of additional transitory income, and small <b>propensities</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume</b> out of news about future income.

A version of the model parameterized to the 2001 tax rebate episode yields consumption responses to fiscal stimulus payments that are in line with the evidence, and an order of magnitude larger than in the standard "one-asset" framework.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the original investigation by William Stanley Jevons, compensations of energy savings due to improved energy efficiency are mostly analyzed by providing energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions. In support of a sustainable resource management, this paper analyzes so-called rebound effects based on resource use. Material flows and associated expenditures by households allow for calculating resource intensities and marginal <b>propensities</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume.</b> Marginal <b>propensities</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume</b> are estimated from data of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) in order to account for indirect rebound effects for food, housing and mobility. Resource intensities are estimated in terms of total material requirements per household final consumption expenditures along the Classification of Individual Consumption according to Purpose (COICOP). Eventually, rebound effects are indicated {{on the basis of}} published saving scenarios in resource and energy demand for Germany. In sum, compensations due to rebound effects are lowest for food while the highest compensations are induced for mobility. This is foremost the result of a relatively high resource intensity of food and a relatively low resource intensity in mobility. Findings are provided by giving various propensity scenarios in order to cope with income differences in Germany. The author concludes that policies on resource conservation need to reconsider rebound effects under the aspect of social heterogeneity...|$|R

40|$|We {{estimate}} marginal <b>propensities</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume</b> from wealth shocks for Italian households {{early in}} the Great Recession. Large asset-price shocks in 2007 - 2008 underpin instrumental variables. A euro fall in risky financial wealth resulted in cuts in annual total (non-durable) consumption of 8. 5 - 9 (5. 5 - 5. 7) cents. We find small effects on food spending. Counterfactuals indicate financial-wealth effects were relatively important for consumption falls in Italy in 2007 / 08. The estimated effects are consistent with a simulated lifecycle model that captures the wealth shock.

5000|$|Marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume</b> {{is present}} in Keynes' {{consumption}} theory and determines by what amount consumption will change {{in response to a}} change in income.|$|E
50|$|Economists often {{distinguish}} between the marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume</b> out of permanent income, and the marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume</b> out of temporary income, because if consumers expect a change in income to be permanent, then they have a greater incentive to increase their consumption. This implies that the Keynesian multiplier should be larger in response to permanent changes in income {{than it is in}} response to temporary changes in income (though the earliest Keynesian analyses ignored these subtleties). However, the distinction between permanent and temporary changes in income is often subtle in practice, and it is often quite difficult to designate a particular change in income as being permanent or temporary. What is more, the marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume</b> should also be affected by factors such as the prevailing interest rate and the general level of consumer surplus that can be derived from purchasing.|$|E
50|$|The MPC {{is higher}} {{in the case of}} poorer people than in rich. When a person earns a higher income, the cost of their basic human needs amount to a smaller {{fraction}} of this income, and correspondingly their average propensity to save is higher than that of a person with a lower income. The marginal propensity to save of the richer classes is greater than that of the poorer classes. If, at any time, it is desired to increase aggregate consumption, then the purchasing power should be transferred from the richer classes (with low <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume)</b> to the poorer classes (with a higher <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume).</b> Likewise, if it is desired to reduce community consumption, the purchasing power must be taken away from the poorer classes by taxing consumption. The marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume</b> {{is higher in}} a poor country and lower in the case of rich country. The reason is same as stated above. In the case of rich country, most common of the basic needs of the people have already been satisfied, and all the additional increments of income are saved, resulting in a higher marginal propensity to save but in a lower marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume.</b> In a poor country, on the other hand, most of the basic needs of the people remain unsatisfied so that additional increments of income go to increase consumption, resulting in a higher marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>consume</b> and a lower marginal propensity to save. This is the reason MPC is higher in the underdeveloped countries of Asia and Africa, and lower in developed countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Germany.|$|E

Responses of total and non-durable spending to changes in housing wealth are 0. 2 to 0. 4 cents/euro.
