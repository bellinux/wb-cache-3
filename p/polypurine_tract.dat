[...] RNase H {{plays a role in}} the priming of the plus-strand, but not in the conventional method of synthesizing a new primer sequence. Rather RNase H creates a [...] "primer" [...] from the PPT that is resistant to RNase H cleavage. By removing all bases but the PPT, the PPT is used as a marker {{for the end of the}} U3 region of its long terminal repeat.|$|E
5000|$|RNA: {{consists}} of a dimer RNA. It has a cap at the 5' end and a poly(A) tail at the 3' end. The RNA genome also has terminal noncoding regions, which are important in replication, and internal regions that encode virion proteins for gene expression. The 5' end includes four regions, which are R, U5, PBS, and L. The R region is a short repeated sequence {{at each end of}} the genome used during the reverse transcription to ensure correct end-to-end transfer in the growing chain. U5, on the other hand, is a short unique sequence between R and PBS. PBS (primer binding site) {{consists of}} 18 bases complementary to 3' end of tRNA primer. L region is an untranslated leader region that gives the signal for packaging of the genome RNA. The 3' end includes 3 regions, which are PPT (<b>polypurine</b> <b>tract),</b> U3, and R. The PPT is a primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis during reverse transcription. U3 is a sequence between PPT and R, which serves as a signal that the provirus can use in transcription. R is the terminal repeated sequence at 3' end.|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of unintegrated {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) DNA from acutely infected human lymphoid cells was analyzed by nuclease S 1 cleavage. We observed a unique, discrete single-stranded gap in unintegrated linear DNA molecules, located {{near the center of}} the genome. Oligonucleotide primer extension experiments determined that the downstream limit of this gap coincides with the last nucleotide of a central copy of the <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract</b> found in all sequenced lentivirus genomes. Other retroviruses have only one copy of the <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract</b> at the 5 ' boundary of the 3 ' long terminal repeat, which has been shown to determine initiation of retroviral DNA plus-strand synthesis. We conclude from our observations that the central repeat of the <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract</b> can create an additional site for plus-strand synthesis initiation in lentiviruses. The central single-stranded gap was not found in circular DNA molecules, the vast majority of them carrying only one long terminal repeat. This finding suggests that the generation of such circular molecules is associated with early DNA ligation events...|$|E
40|$|Guanine (G) -rich DNA readily forms four-stranded quadruplexes in vitro, but {{evidence}} {{for their participation}} in genome regulation is limited. We have identified a quadruplex-binding protein, Lia 3, that controls the boundaries of germline-limited, internal eliminated sequences (IESs) of Tetrahymena thermophila. Differentiation of this ciliate's somatic genome requires excision of thousands of IESs, targeted for removal by small-RNA-directed heterochromatin formation. In cells lacking LIA 3 (ΔLIA 3), the excision of IESs bounded by specific G-rich <b>polypurine</b> <b>tracts</b> was impaired and imprecise, whereas the removal of IESs without such controlling sequences was unaffected. We found that oligonucleotides containing these <b>polypurine</b> <b>tracts</b> formed parallel G-quadruplex structures that are specifically bound by Lia 3. The discovery that Lia 3 binds G-quadruplex DNA and controls the accuracy of DNA elimination at loci with specific G-tracts uncovers an unrecognized potential of quadruplex structures to regulate chromosome organization...|$|R

Footprint experiments, gel retardation assays and thermal denaturation measures on a sequence appropriately designed with two adjacent alternate-strand <b>polypurine</b> <b>tracts</b> {{points out that the}} addition of an adenine residue and the removal of one nucleotide should facilitate the crossing strands at the 5 "-TpA- 3 " junction and at the 5 "-ApT- 3 " junction, respectively. These results provide a 'switch code' for the construction of alternate-strand triple helix forming oligonucleotides which open new possibilities for extending the range of applications of antigene strategy...|$|R
40|$|Poly(pyrimidine). <b>poly(purine)</b> <b>tracts</b> {{have been}} {{discovered}} in the 5 '-flanking regions of many eucaryotic genes. They {{may be involved in}} the regulation of expression since they can be mapped to the nuclease-sensitive sites of active chromatin. We have found that poly(pyrimidine). poly(purine) DNAs which contain 5 -methylcytosine (e. g. poly[d(Tm 5 C) ]. poly[d(GA) ]) will form a triplex at a pH below 8. In contrast, the unmethylated analogue, poly[d(TC) ]. poly[d(GA) ] only forms a triplex at pHs below 6. Synthetic DNAs containing repeating trinucleotides and poly[d(Um 5 C) ]. poly[d(GA) ] behave in a similar manner. Thus the stability of a triplex can be controlled by methylation of cytosine. This suggests a model for the regulation of expression based upon specific triplex formation on the 5 '-side of eucaryotic genes...|$|R

Here, we demonstrate {{that some of the}} alleles can be explained by a deletion of approximately 100 bp DNA and show that alleles of this novel, highly polymorphic locus are as strongly associated with haemochromatosis as HLA-A 3 or D 6 S 105 - 8. The observed frequency of heterozygosity at HLA-RF is extremely high (95 %) and this locus {{has been found to be}} informative in pedigrees that are non-informative at HLA-A and D 6 S 105.

40|$|Polypurine tracts are {{important}} elements of eukaryotic promoters. They are believed to somehow destabilize chromatin, but the mechanism of their action is not known. We show that incorporating an A 16 element at an end of the nucleosomal DNA and further inward destabilizes histone-DNA interactions by 0. 1 ± 0. 03 and 0. 35 ± 0. 04 kcal mol− 1, respectively, and is accompanied by 1. 5 - ± 0. 1 -fold and 1. 7 - ± 0. 1 -fold increases in position-averaged equilibrium accessibility of nucleosomal DNA target sites. These effects are comparable in magnitude to effects of A 16 elements that correlate with transcription in vivo, suggesting that our system may capture most of their physiological role. These results point to two distinct but interrelated models for the mechanism of action of <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract</b> promoter elements in vivo. Given a nucleosome positioned over a promoter region, {{the presence of a}} <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract</b> in that nucleosome's DNA decreases the stability of the DNA wrapping, increasing the equilibrium accessibility of other DNA target sites buried inside that nucleosome. Alternatively (if nucleosomes are freely mobile), the presence of a <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract</b> provides a free energy bias for the nucleosome to move to alternative locations, thereby changing the equilibrium accessibilities of other nearby DNA target sites...|$|E

These triple-helical complexes are much more stable than those formed by oligonucleotides with natural phosphodiester linkages. Oligonucleotide phosphoramidates containing thymine and cytosine or thymine, cytosine, and guanine bind strongly to the <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract</b> of human immunodeficiency virus proviral DNA under physiological conditions. Site-specific cleavage by the Dra I restriction enzyme at the 5 ' end of the polypurine sequence was inhibited by triplex formation. A eukaryotic transcription assay was used to investigate the effect of oligophosphoramidate binding to the <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract</b> sequence on transcription of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus nef gene {{under the control of}} a cytomegalovirus promoter.

40|$|The mouse genomic locus {{containing}} the oncogene c-mos was analyzed for repetitive DNA sequences. We found a single B 1 repeat 10 kb upstream and three B 1 repeats 0. 6 kb, 2. 7 kb, and 5. 4 kb, respectively, downstream from c-mos. The B 1 repeat closest to c-mos contains an internal 7 -bp duplication and a 18 -bp insertion. Localized between {{the last two}} B 1 repeats is {{a copy of a}} novel mouse repeat. Sequence comparison of three copies of this novel repeat family shows that they a) contain a conserved BglII site, b) are approximately 420 bp long, c) possess internal 50 -bp <b>polypurine</b> <b>tracts,</b> and d) have structural characteristics of transposable elements. They are present in about 1500 copies per haploid genome in the mouse, but are not detectable in DNA of other mammals. The BglII repeat downstream from c-mos is interrupted by a single 632 -bp LTR element. We estimate that approximately 1200 copies of this element are present per haploid genome in BALB/c mice. It shares sequence homology in the R-U 5 region with an LTR element found in 129 /J mice...|$|R
40|$|Long {{terminal}} repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are transposable {{elements in}} eukaryotic genomes {{well suited for}} computational identification. De novo identification tools determine the position of potential LTR retrotransposon or ERV insertions in genomic sequences. For further analysis, it is desirable to obtain an annotation of the internal structure of such candidates. This article presents LTRdigest, a novel software tool for automated annotation of internal features of putative LTR retrotransposons. It uses local alignment and hidden Markov model-based algorithms to detect retrotransposon-associated protein domains as well as primer binding sites and <b>polypurine</b> <b>tracts.</b> As an example, we used LTRdigest results to identify 88 (near) full-length ERVs in the chromosome 4 sequence of Mus musculus, separating them from truncated insertions and other repeats. Furthermore, we propose a work flow {{for the use of}} LTRdigest in de novo LTR retrotransposon classification and perform an exemplary de novo analysis on the Drosophila melanogaster genome as a proof of concept. Using a new method solely based on the annotations generated by LTRdigest, 518 potential LTR retrotransposons were automatically assigned to 62 candidate groups. Representative sequences from 41 of these 62 groups were matched to reference sequences with > 80 % global sequence similarity...|$|R
40|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} {{polycystic kidney}} disease (ADPKD) affects over 500 000 Americans. Eighty-five percent of these patients have mutations in the PKD 1 gene. The focal nature of cyst formation has recently been attributed to innate instability in the PKD 1 gene. Intron 21 of this gene contains the largest <b>polypurine.</b> polypyrimidine <b>tract</b> (2. 5 kb) identified to date in the human genome. Polypurine. polypyrimidine mirror repeats form intramolecular triplexes, which may predispose the gene to mutagenesis. A recombinant plasmid containing the entire PKD 1 intron 21 was analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and it exhibited sharp structural transitions under conditions of negative supercoiling and acidic pH. The superhelical density at which the transition occurred was linearly related to pH, consistent with formation of protonated DNA structures. P 1 nuclease mapping studies of a plasmid containing the entire intron 21 identified four single-stranded regions where structural transitions occurred at low superhelical densities. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and chemical modification studies of the plasmid containing a 46 bp mirror repeat {{from one of the}} four regions demonstrated the formation of an H-y 3 triplex structure. In summary, these experiments demonstrate that a 2500 bp <b>polypurine.</b> polypyrimidine <b>tract</b> within the PKD 1 gene is capable of forming multiple non-B-DNA structures...|$|R

40|$|Human {{sequences}} {{that are}} related to the mouse mammary tumor virus (MuMTV) genome were cloned from breast tumor cell DNA. Of 100 recombinants, only 1 hybridized with two different probes from separate regions of the MuMTV genome (gag-pol and long terminal repeat [LTR]). This sequence, NMWV 4, was shown to have a proviruslike structure. Hybridization to digests of normal and tumor cell DNA indicated that NMWV 4 and a few closely related sequences are endogenous to the human genome. The regions that contain homology to the MuMTV LTR were sequenced. Long repeated sequences with the hallmarks of retroviral LTRs were identified. The NMWV 4 LTR contains transcription initiation and termination signals and is flanked by a <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract</b> (5 ' LTR) and a primer-binding site (3 ' LTR).

40|$|The {{structural}} {{basis of}} DNA curvature remains elusive, because models for curvature based on crystallographic structures of molecules containing A tracts {{do not agree}} with any of the models for sequence-directed curvature based on solution studies. Here we demonstrate that the difference is probably due to MPD (2 -methyl- 2, 4 -pentanediol), the dehydrating agent commonly used in crystallography. One characteristic signature of curved DNA molecules is that they run anomalously slowly on polyacrylamide gels, appearing to be larger than they actually are. The gel anomalies of three curved DNAs from trypanosome kinetoplast minicircles drop monotonically with increasing MPD concentration, indicating that MPD straightens molecules that are curved in aqueous solution. This is not due to some non-specific effect of MPD on poly(dA) or <b>polypurine</b> <b>tracts,</b> because control molecules containing dA 70 and dG 43 run normally over the full range of MPD concentrations. Circular dichroism spectra are not affected by MPD, ruling out a conformational change to a structure outside the B-DNA family. The effect is not due to MPD-induced changes in phasing of the curved sequences, because MPD has virtually no effect on the linking numbers of relaxed plasmids containing either curved sequences or dA 70. At the concentrations of MPD used in X-ray crystallography, the curvature of DNAs containing A tracts is substantially lower than in solution, which probably explains the ongoing discrepancies between the crystallographic results and models based on solution studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of an organism's adaptation to high temperatures {{has been investigated}} intensively in recent years. It was suggested that the macromolecules of thermophilic microorganisms (especially proteins) have structural features that enhance their thermostability. We compared mRNA sequences of 72 fully sequenced prokaryotic proteomes (14 thermophilic and 58 mesophilic species). Although {{the differences between the}} percentage of adenine plus guanine content of whole mRNAs of different prokaryotic species are much lower than those of guanine plus cytosine content, the thermophile purine-pyrimidine (R/Y) ratio within their mRNAs is significantly higher than that of the mesophiles. The first and third codon positions of both thermophiles and mesophiles are purine-biased, with the bias more pronounced by the thermophiles. Thermophile mRNAs that display the highest R/Y ratio (1. 43 – 1. 69) are those of the ribosomal proteins, histone-like proteins, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunits, and heat-shock proteins. Within mesophilic prokaryotes and five eukaryotic species, the R/Y ratio of the mRNAs of heat-shock proteins is higher than their average over coding part of the genome. <b>Polypurine</b> <b>tracts</b> (R) n (with n ≥ 5) are much more abundant within the thermophile mRNAs compared with mesophiles. Between two sequential pure-purinic codons of thermophile mRNAs, there is a rather strong tendency for the occurrence of adenine but not guanine tracts. The data suggest that mixed adenine·guanine and polyadenine tracts in mRNAs increase the thermostability beyond the contribution of amino acids encoded by purine tracts, which highlights the importance of ecological stress in the evolution of genome architecture...|$|R
40|$|The {{status of}} p 53 was {{investigated}} in breast tumours arising in germ-line carriers of mutant alleles of BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 and in a control series of sporadic breast tumours. p 53 expression was detected in 20 / 26 (77 %) BRCA 1 -, 10 / 22 (45 %) BRCA 2 -associated and 25 / 72 (35 %) grade-matched sporadic tumours. Analysis of p 53 sequence revealed that the gene was mutant in 33 / 50 (66 %) BRCA-associated tumours, whereas 7 / 20 (35 %) sporadic grade-matched tumours contained p 53 mutation (P < 0. 05). A number of the mutations detected in the BRCA-associated tumours have not been previously described in human cancer databases, whilst others occur extremely rarely. Analysis of additional genes, p 16 (INK 4), Ki-ras and β-globin revealed absence or very low incidence of mutations, suggesting that the higher frequency of p 53 mutation in the BRCA-associated tumours does not reflect a generalized increase in susceptibility to the acquisition of somatic mutation. Furthermore, absence of frameshift mutations in the <b>polypurine</b> <b>tracts</b> present in the coding sequence of the TGF β type II receptor (TGF β IIR) and Bax implies that loss of function of BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 does not confer a mutator phenotype such as that found in tumours with microsatellite instability (MSI). p 21 (Waf 1) was expressed in BRCA-associated tumours regardless of p 53 status and, furthermore, some tumours expressing wild-type p 53 did not express detectable p 21 (Waf 1). These data do not support, therefore, the simple model based on studies of BRCA-/- embryos, in which mutation of p 53 in BRCA-associated tumours results in loss of p 21 (Waf 1) expression and deregulated proliferation. Rather, they imply that proliferation of such tumours {{will be subject to}} multiple mechanisms of growth regulation...|$|R
40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) Vif protein blocks incorporation of two host cell cytidine deaminases, APOBEC 3 F and 3 G, into the budding virion. Not surprisingly, on a vif background nascent minus strand DNA can be extensively edited leaving multiple uracil residues. Editing occurs preferentially {{in the context of}} TC (GA on the plus strand) and CC (GG) depending on the enzyme. To explore the distribution of APOBEC 3 F and – 3 G editing across the genome, a product/ substrate ratio (AA 1 AG) /(GA 1 GG) was computed for a series of 30 edited genomes present in the data bases. Two highly polarized gradients were noted each with maxima just 50 to the central <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract</b> (cPPT) and LTR proximal <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract</b> (30 PPT). The gradients are in remarkable agreement with the time the minus strand DNA remains single stranded. In vitro analyses of APOBEC 3 G deamina-tion of nascent cDNA spanning the two PPTs showed no pronounced dependence on the PPT RNA:DNA heteroduplex ruling out the competing hypothesis of a PPT orientation effect. The degree of hypermutation varied smoothly among genomes indicating that the number of APOBEC 3 molecules packaged varied considerably...|$|E

40|$|We {{previously}} {{reported that in}} the endogenous reaction of Rous sarcoma virus disrupted by melittin, plus-strand DNA initiates on a small oligonucleotide primer and that this initiation can be reconstructed in vitro in reactions containing purified minus-strand DNA as template, viral RNA {{as a source of}} primer, and reverse transcriptase (Smith et al., J. Virol. 49 : 200 - 204, 1984). Further studies on the specificity of initiation in the endogenous reaction have shown the following. (i) The primer was 12 nucleotides in length. Its sequence began with a 5 ' pyrimidine, followed by 11 purines, ending with rGrA- 3 '. This sequence was in agreement with the known plus-strand RNA sequence immediately upstream from the initiation site. Thus, the primer began one nucleotide 5 ' to the so-called <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract</b> that has been found on all retrovirus genomes. (ii) The transition point between RNA primer and DNA product was precisely located. It was {{before the end of the}} <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract.</b> Thus the <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract,</b> although essential for virus replication and probably a flag for the priming event, did not define the limits of the RNA primer. After primer removal, the DNA had a 5 ' phosphate, consistent with generation by the viral RNase H activity. The priming specificity in reconstructed reactions was also examined further, with the following observations. (i) When the source of RNA primer was prehybridized to the template viral DNA, the generation, utilization, and subsequent removal of primer were essentially the same as those observed in the endogenous reaction. In the absence of deliberate prehybridization, some specificity was lost. There were than additional locations for the 5 ' end of the primer as well as the transition point between RNA primer and DNA. (ii) Purine-rich oligoribonucleotides created by RNase A digestion of viral RNA could prime strong-stop plus DNA, but again with the loss of specificity relative to that in the endogenous reaction. (iii) The 5 ' end of the minus-strand DNA template was not required for initiation of strong-stop plus DNA. Therefore, the specificity of initiation did not depend upon an intramolecular interaction requiring the two inverted repeat sequences that flank the long terminal repeat...|$|E
40|$|The human polynucleotide {{cytidine}} deaminases APOBEC 3 G (hA 3 G) and APOBEC 3 F (hA 3 F) are antiviral restriction factors {{capable of}} inducing extensive plus-strand guanine-to-adenine (G-to-A) hypermutation {{in a variety}} of retroviruses and retroelements, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1). They differ in target specificity, favoring plus-strand 5 ′GG and 5 ′GA dinucleotide motifs, respectively. To characterize their mutational preferences in detail, we analyzed single-copy, near-full-length HIV- 1 proviruses which had been hypermutated in vitro by hA 3 G or hA 3 F. hA 3 -induced G-to-A mutation rates were significantly influenced by the wider sequence context of the target G. Moreover, hA 3 G, {{and to a lesser extent}} hA 3 F, displayed clear tetranucleotide preference hierarchies, irrespective of the genomic region examined and overall hypermutation rate. We similarly analyzed patient-derived hypermutated HIV- 1 genomes using a new method for estimating reference sequences. The majority of these, regardless of subtype, carried signatures of hypermutation that strongly correlated with those induced in vitro by hA 3 G. Analysis of genome-wide hA 3 -induced mutational profiles confirmed that hypermutation levels were reduced downstream of the <b>polypurine</b> <b>tracts.</b> Additionally, while hA 3 G mutations were found throughout the genome, hA 3 F often intensely mutated shorter regions, the locations of which varied between proviruses. We extended our analysis to human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) from the HERV-K(HML 2) family, finding two elements that carried clear footprints of hA 3 G activity. This constitutes the most direct evidence to date for hA 3 G activity in the context of natural HERV infections, demonstrating the involvement of this restriction factor in defense against retroviral attacks over millions of years of human evolution...|$|R

Transduction efficiency and biodistribution were determined, following systemic administration of these improved lentiviral vectors. In adult severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, efficient stable gene transfer was achieved in the liver (8. 0 % +/- 6. 0 %) and spleen (24 % +/- 3 %). Most transduced hepatocytes and nonhepatocytes were nondividing, thereby obviating the need to induce liver cell proliferation. In vivo gene transfer with this improved lentiviral vector was relatively safe since liver enzyme concentration in the plasma was only moderately and transiently elevated. In addition, nondividing major histocompatibility complex class II-positive splenic antigen-presenting cells (APCs) were efficiently transduced in SCID and normal mice. Furthermore, B cells were efficiently transduced, whereas T cells were refractory to lentiviral transduction in vivo. However, in neonatal recipients, lentiviral transduction was more widespread and included not only hepatocytes and splenic APCs but also cardiomyocytes. The present study suggests potential uses of improved lentiviral vectors for gene therapy of genetic blood disorders resulting from serum protein deficiencies, such as hemophilia, and hepatic disease. However, the use of liver-specific promoters may be warranted to circumvent inadvertent transgene expression in APCs. In addition, these improved lentiviral vectors could potentially be useful for genetic vaccination and treatment of perinatal cardiac disorders. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{an earlier}} study on minus-strand DNA {{synthesis}} catalyzed by murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, we described a prominent pause site near the <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract</b> (J. Guo, W. Wu, Z. Y. Yuan, K. Post, R. J. Crouch, and J. G. Levin, Biochemistry 34 : 5018 - 5029, 1995). We now report that pausing at this site {{is due to a}} stem-loop structure in the RNA template, formed by interaction of a number of bases in the <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract,</b> including the six G's, and a 3 ' sequence which includes four C's. Addition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) nucleocapsid (NC) protein to reverse transcriptase reactions reduces pausing by approximately 8 - to 10 -fold and stimulates synthesis of full-length DNA. Thus, NC functions as an accessory protein during elongation of minus-strand DNA and increases the efficiency of DNA synthesis, in this case, by apparently destabilizing a region of secondary structure in the template. Since NC is associated with genomic RNA in the viral core and is likely {{to be part of a}} viral replication complex, these results suggest that NC may also promote efficient DNA synthesis during virus replication. Mutational analysis indicates that the features of HIV- 1 NC which are important for reduction of pausing include the basic amino acids flanking the first zinc finger, the zinc fingers, and the cysteine and aromatic amino acids within the fingers. These findings suggest that reverse transcription might be targeted by drugs which inactivate the zinc fingers of HIV- 1 NC...|$|E

However, the canonical CA {{is not involved in}} joining the aberrant U 3 LTR to the host DNA, generating either large duplications or deletions of the host sequences instead of the normal 5 - or 6 -bp duplication...|$|E
40|$|We tested {{whether the}} {{additional}} positive-strand DNA synthesis initiation of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) from the central <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract</b> (cPPT) facilitates efficient completion of kinetically disturbed proviral DNA synthesis induced by dysfunctional reverse transcriptase (RT) mutants or limited cellular deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools. Indeed, the cPPT enabled the HIV- 1 vectors harboring RT mutants with reduced dNTP binding affinity to transduce human lung fibroblasts (HLFs), without which these mutant vectors normally fail to transduce. The cPPT showed little effect on wild-type HIV- 1 vector transduction in HLF, whereas it significantly enhanced vector transduction in HLFs engineered to contain reduced dNTP pools, suggesting a novel compensatory role for cPPT in viruses harboring kinetically impaired RT...|$|E
40|$|Lentiviruses utilize two polypurine tracts for {{initiation}} of plus-strand viral DNA synthesis. We have examined {{to what extent}} human immunodeficiency virus type 1 plus-strand initiation at the central <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract</b> (cPPT) could protect the viral genome from DNA editing by APOBEC 3 G and APOBEC 3 B. The presence of a functional cPPT, but not of a mutated cPPT, extensively reduced editing by both APOBEC 3 G and APOBEC 3 B of sequences downstream, but not upstream, of the cPPT, with significant protection observed as far as 400 bp downstream. Thus, {{in addition to other}} potential functions, the cPPT could help protect lentiviruses from editing by cytidine deaminases of the APOBEC family...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe LTRs of all primate lentiviruses contain long U 3 regions {{overlapping}} the nef gene. To {{assess the}} relevance of the modulatory U 3 region for HIV- 1 replication, we inactivated the T-rich region, the <b>Polypurine</b> <b>tract</b> and attachment (att) sequences in nef by silent mutations and inserted intact cis-regulatory elements just upstream of the core enhancer. These modifications severely truncated the U 3 region and eliminated the nef overlap. The resulting HIV- 1 mutants expressed functional Nef, replicated efficiently and caused CD 4 + T cell depletion in ex vivo-infected lymphoid tissue suggesting that the modulatory U 3 region might not be essential for efficient HIV- 1 gene expression and AIDS pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|A partial {{sequence}} of a Ty 1 -copia retrotransposon was {{isolated from the}} genome of the rye (Secale cereale L.) inbred line L 318 using degenerate primers targeted at the RNaseH sequence. Its putative 3 ’LTR region exhibited similarity to LTRs of known plant retrotransposons such as BARE- 1, while no significant similarity to known rye retrotransposon sequences was found. A Sequence Specific Amplification Polymorphism (SSAP) protocol employing primer designed to correspond to the putative <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract</b> was developed and used for analysis of 30 rye inbred lines. Values of the parameters calculated to evaluate {{the efficiency of the}} method as well as the results of cluster analysis demonstrate that it is a powerful tool for genetic diversity analyses of rye...|$|E
40|$|HIV- 1 {{and certain}} other retroviruses {{initiate}} plus-strand synthesis {{in the center}} of the genome as well as at the standard retroviral 3 ′ <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract.</b> This peculiarity of reverse transcription results in a central DNA “flap” structure that has been of controversial functional significance. We mutated both HIV- 1 flap-generating elements, the central <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract</b> (cPPT) and the central termination sequence (CTS). To avoid an ambiguity of previous studies, we did so without affecting integrase coding. DNA flap formation was disrupted but single-cycle infection was unaffected in all target cells tested, regardless of cell cycle status. Spreading HIV- 1 infection was also normal in most T cell lines, and flap mutant viruses replicated equivalently to the wild type in nondividing cells, including macrophages. However, spreading infection of flap mutant HIV- 1 was impaired in non-vif-permissive cells (HuT 78, H 9, and primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs]), suggesting APOBEC 3 G (A 3 G) restriction. Single-cycle infections confirmed that vif-intact flap mutant HIV- 1 is restricted by producer cell A 3 G/F. Combining the Δvif and cPPT-CTS mutations increased A 3 G restriction synergistically. Moreover, RNA interference knockdown of A 3 G in HuT 78 cells released the block to flap mutant HIV- 1 replication. Flap mutant HIV- 1 also accrued markedly increased A 3 G-mediated G→A hypermutation compared to that of wild-type HIV- 1 (a full log 10 in the 0. 36 kb downstream of the mutant cPPT). We suggest that the triple-stranded DNA structure, the flap, is not the consequential outcome. The salient functional feature is central plus-strand initiation, which functions as a second line of defense against single-stranded DNA editing by A 3 proteins that survive producer cell degradation by Vif...|$|E
40|$|We {{recently}} reported {{the presence of}} linear duplex DNA intermediates with {{a gap in the}} middle of the molecules in the replicative cycle of human (HSRV) and simian (SFV 1) spumaviruses. The <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract</b> (PPT), at the 5 ' boundary of the 3 ' long terminal repeat, was found to be duplicated in the gap region. By molecular analysis of HSRV proviral DNA with region- and strand-specific probes, we have now determined that the gap is located on plus-strand DNA and that it is 120 bases long with the 3 ' end mapping at the duplicated PPT site. Kinetic analysis of proviral DNA provided evidence that the gap did not result from processing of a complete, full-length DNA molecule. These data strongly suggest that plus-strand DNA synthesis is initiated at both PPT sites...|$|E
40|$|Reverse {{transcription}} in {{the yeast}} retrotransposon Ty 1 follows the general "rules" of retroviral replication overall. However, {{some details of}} the retroviral and Ty 1 reverse transcription processes are different. We have identified and determined the structure of plus-strand strong-stop DNA and examined the effect of <b>polypurine</b> <b>tract</b> deletion mutations on its synthesis. Furthermore, we have defined the stop signal for plus-strand strong-stop DNA synthesis as an unusual 2 '-O-ribosylated nucleotide in the primer tRNA. Full-length plus-strand strong-stop DNA, following strand transfer, would have a terminal 2 -base mismatch with minus-strand DNA. These findings indicate that the mechanism of plus-strand strong-stop DNA transfer in Ty 1 {{differs from that of}} the retroviral transfer and suggest that full-length plus-strand strong-stop DNA is not a direct intermediate in Ty 1 retrotransposition...|$|E
