40|$|Surface topography, surface {{residual}} stress and bending strength of RBSiC ground using diamond wheel were studied. Grinding RBSiC is removed mainly by brittle fracture and lightly by ductile cutting. With {{the increase of}} <b>down</b> <b>feed,</b> surface roughness Ra increases. Burnishing with no <b>down</b> <b>feed</b> can improve the Ra in some way. With increasing <b>down</b> <b>feed,</b> the compressive {{residual stress}} decreases because of an inadequately cooling effect. Compare with the specimens grounded using 0. 9 μm/s, those using <b>down</b> <b>feed</b> of 1. 35 μm/s have worse surface quality. Considering both the processing efficiency and the surface quality, the optimum parameters are as follow: 0. 9 μm/s <b>down</b> <b>feed,</b> 2. 1 r/min work table rotational speed and 1 min burnishing...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} some {{opportunities and challenges}} that arise in energy-aware computing in a cluster of servers running data-intensive workloads. We leverage the insight that servers in a cluster are often underutilized, which makes it attractive to consider <b>powering</b> <b>down</b> some servers and redistributing their load to others. Of course, <b>powering</b> <b>down</b> servers naively will render data stored only on <b>powered</b> <b>down</b> servers inaccessible. While data replication can be exploited to <b>power</b> <b>down</b> servers without losing access to data, unfortunately, {{care must be taken}} {{in the design of the}} replication and server <b>power</b> <b>down</b> schemes to avoid creating load imbalances on the remaining “live ” servers. Accordingly, in this paper we study the interaction between energy management, load balancing, and replication strategies for data-intensive cluster computing. In particular, we show that Chained Declustering – a replication strategy proposed more than 20 years ago – can support very flexible energy management schemes. ...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{observations}} for {{the performance}} of a jet pump are presented with two different suction configurations and designs. The experimental rig was constructed in such a way it can be used with up feed (negative suction head) or <b>down</b> <b>feed</b> (positive suction head). During experimental programme water is used in both motive and pumped sides. The effect of nozzle-to-throat spacing to nozzle diameter ratio “X”, on the jet pump performance was also tested, with different flow rates and motive pressures, in both cases (up <b>feed</b> and <b>down</b> <b>feed).</b> It was found that the best efficiency for the jet pump is attained with the up feeding configuration.

40|$|Abstract—Static power {{consumption}} {{is an important}} com-ponent of the total {{power consumption}} in FPGAs built using 90 nm and smaller technology nodes. A previous study proposed <b>powering</b> <b>down</b> regions of logic blocks in an FPGA when idle to reduce the static power dissipation. This previous work did not consider <b>powering</b> <b>down</b> the switch blocks (SBs). However, the static power of SBs constitute more than 50 % of an FPGA’s static power. In this paper, we present an architecture that enables selectively <b>powering</b> <b>down</b> SBs along with the logic blocks during their idle periods. The potential power savings from this architecture depends on the proportion of SBs that can be <b>powered</b> <b>down.</b> We present modifications to our CAD flow to maximize {{the number of such}} SBs, and we experimentally estimate their proportion using a set of synthetic benchmark circuits. Our estimation results show that 53 % to 83 % of the SBs can be <b>powered</b> <b>down</b> in a functional module of size 24 × 24 tiles and an architecture power gating regions of size 4 × 4 tiles, leading to overall static power reductions of 70 % to 84 % compared to an architecture that does not support power gating.
