40|$|Manufacturing <b>accuracy,</b> {{especially}} <b>position</b> <b>accuracy</b> of fastener holes, directly affects {{service life}} {{and security of}} aircraft. The traditional modification has poor robustness, while the modification based on laser tracker costs too much. To improve the relative <b>position</b> <b>accuracy</b> of aircraft as-sembly drilling, and ensure the hole-edge distance requirement, a method was presented to mod-ify the coordinates of drilling holes. Based on online inspecting two positions of pre-assembly holes and their theoretical coordinates, the spatial coordinate transformation matrix of modifica-tion could be calculated. Thus the straight drilling holes could be modified. The method improves relative <b>position</b> <b>accuracy</b> of drilling on simple structure effectively. And it reduces the require-ment of absolute <b>position</b> <b>accuracy</b> {{and the cost of}} position modification. And the process techni-cian also can use this method to decide the <b>position</b> <b>accuracy</b> of different pre-assembly holes based on the accuracy requirement of assembly holes...|$|R
2500|$|Long {{baseline}} systems {{get their}} {{name from the}} fact that the spacing of the baseline transponders is long or similar to the distance between the diver or vehicle and the transponders. [...] That is, the baseline transponders are typically mounted in the corners of an underwater work site within which the vehicle or diver operates. This method yields an ideal geometry for positioning, in which any given error in acoustic range measurements produce only about an equivalent position error. [...] This compares to SBL and USBL systems with shorter baselines where ranging disturbances of a given amount can result in much larger position errors. Further, the mounting of the baseline transponders on the sea floor eliminates the need for converting between reference frames, as is the case for USBL or SBL positioning systems mounted on moving vessels. Finally, sea floor mounting makes the <b>positioning</b> <b>accuracy</b> independent of water depth. [...] For these reasons LBL systems are generally applied to tasks where the required standard of <b>positioning</b> <b>accuracy</b> or reliability exceeds the capabilities of USBL and SBL systems.|$|E
2500|$|A long {{baseline}} (LBL) acoustic positioning system {{is one of}} three broad classes of underwater acoustic positioning systems that are used to track underwater vehicles and divers. The other two classes are ultra short baseline systems (USBL) and short baseline systems (SBL). LBL systems are unique in that they use networks of sea-floor mounted baseline transponders as reference points for navigation. These are generally deployed around the perimeter of a work site. The LBL technique results in very high <b>positioning</b> <b>accuracy</b> and position stability that is independent of water depth. [...] It is generally better than 1-meter and can reach a few centimeters accuracy. LBL systems are generally employed for precision underwater survey work where the accuracy or position stability of ship-based (SBL, USBL) positioning systems does not suffice.|$|E

40|$|The static {{horizontal}} <b>position</b> <b>accuracy</b> of a mapping-grade GNSS receiver {{was tested}} in two forest types over two seasons, and subsequently was tested in one forest type against open sky {{conditions in the}} winter season. The main objective {{was to determine whether}} the holding position during data collection would result in significantly different static horizontal <b>position</b> <b>accuracy.</b> Additionally, we wanted to determine whether the time of year (season), forest type, or environmental variables had an influence on accuracy. In general, the F 4 Devices Flint GNSS receiver was found to have mean static horizontal <b>position</b> <b>accuracy</b> levels within the ranges typically expected for this general type of receiver (3 to 5 m) when differential correction was not employed. When used under forest cover, in some cases the GNSS receiver provided a higher level of static horizontal <b>position</b> <b>accuracy</b> when held vertically, as opposed to held at an angle or horizontally (the more natural positions), perhaps due to the orientation of the antenna within the receiver, or in part due to multipath or the inability to use certain satellite signals. Therefore, {{due to the fact that}} numerous variables may affect static horizontal <b>position</b> <b>accuracy,</b> we only conclude that there is weak to moderate evidence that the results of holding position are significant. Statistical test results also suggest that the season of data collection had no significant effect on static horizontal <b>position</b> <b>accuracy,</b> and results suggest that atmospheric variables had weak correlation with horizontal <b>position</b> <b>accuracy.</b> Forest type was found to have a significant effect on static horizontal <b>position</b> <b>accuracy</b> in one aspect of one test, yet otherwise there was little evidence that forest type affected horizontal <b>position</b> <b>accuracy.</b> Since the holding position was found in some cases to be significant with regard to the static horizontal <b>position</b> <b>accuracy</b> of <b>positions</b> collected in forests, it may be beneficial to have an understanding of antenna positioning within the receiver to achieve the greatest accuracy during data collection...|$|R
