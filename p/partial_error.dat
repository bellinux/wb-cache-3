To exploit these oppor-tunities one needs to identify appropriate units, types and time scales of vocal change in nearly real time. The previous chapter by Tchernikovski et al. in this volume described techniques that make this research strategy feasible by al-lowing us to observe the song learning process through a “temporal micro-scope ” with variable degrees of resolution. In this chapter we summarize {{some of the new}} observations and raise hypotheses about the learning strategy of the bird. We focus on inferences that can be drawn from behavioral observations to the nature and complexity of the instructive signal that guides the vocal change (error-signal). We examine two effects: i) the emergence of syllable types and ii) changes in features within a syllable type. We found that different features of the same syllable change during different and sometimes disjointed developmental windows. We discuss the possibility that song imitation is achieved by correcting <b>partial</b> <b>errors,</b> and that features of those <b>partial</b> <b>errors</b> change adaptively during development, perhaps concurrently with changes in perception and in motor proficiency. Those hypotheses can be best examined by across levels investigation, starting from identifying critical moments in song development and recording of articulatory dynamics and neural patterns when only a few features of specific syllables undergo rapid changes. Such in-vestigation could relate behavioral events to brain mechanisms that guide song learning from moment-to-moment and across extended periods...|$|R

40|$|Mainstream {{programming}} is migrating to concurrent archi-tectures {{to improve performance}} and facilitate more complex computation. The {{state of the art}} analysis tools for detect-ing concurrency errors such as deadlocks and race condi-tions are imprecise, generate a large number of false error reports, and require manual verification of each error report. In this paper we present a guided test approach to help au-tomate the verification of reported errors in multi-threaded Java programs. The input to the guided test is a small se-quence of program locations (<b>partial</b> <b>error</b> trace) manually generated from the potential errors reported by the impre-cise static analysis techniques. The guided test dynamically controls thread schedules during program execution in an effort to drive the program through the <b>partial</b> <b>error</b> trace and elicit a concurrency error. The scheduling decisions are made based on a two tier ranking system that first considers the portion of the error trace already observed and the per-ceived closeness to the next location in the error trace. The error traces generated by the technique are real and require no manual verification. We show the effectiveness of our ap-proach in a set of benchmarked concurrency programs, and we automatically verify the existence of race conditions and deadlocks in the JDK 1. 4 concurrent libraries as reported from the Jlint static analysis tool. 1...|$|E

The simulations clearly show that conflict increases as temporal overlap between response activation increases, whereas the experimental results demonstrate that the amplitude of the Ne decreases as temporal overlap increases, suggesting that the ACC does not monitor conflict.

Whereas SPECT data are commonly interpreted qualitatively {{in a clinical}} setting, the ability to accurately quantify measurements will increase {{the utility of the}} SPECT data for laboratory measurements involving small animals. In this work, we assess the effect of photon attenuation, scatter and <b>partial</b> volume <b>errors</b> on the quantitative accuracy of small animal SPECT measurements, first with Monte Carlo simulation and then confirmed with experimental measurements. The simulations modeled the imaging geometry of a commercially available small animal SPECT system. We simulated the imaging of a radioactive source within a cylinder of water, and reconstructed the projection data using iterative reconstruction algorithms. The size of the source {{and the size of the}} surrounding cylinder were varied to evaluate the effects of photon attenuation and scatter on quantitative accuracy. We found that photon attenuation can reduce the measured concentration of radioactivity in a volume of interest in the center of a rat-sized cylinder of water by up to 50 percent when imaging with iodine- 125, and up to 25 percent when imaging with technetium- 99 m. When imaging with iodine- 125, the scatter-to-primary ratio can reach up to approximately 30 percent, and can cause overestimation of the radioactivity concentration when reconstructing data with attenuation correction. We varied the size of the source to evaluate <b>partial</b> volume <b>errors,</b> which we found to be a strong function of the size of the volume of interest and the spatial resolution. These errors can result in large (> 50 percent) changes in the measured amount of radioactivity. The simulation results were compared with and found to agree with experimental measurements.
