5|$|Shapinsay {{is one of}} the Orkney Islands off {{the north}} coast of {{mainland}} Scotland. There is one village on the island, Balfour, from which roll-on/roll-off car ferries sail to Kirkwall on the Orkney Mainland. Balfour Castle, built in the Scottish Baronial style, {{is one of the}} island's most <b>prominent</b> <b>features,</b> a reminder of the Balfour family's domination of Shapinsay during the 18th and 19th centuries; the Balfours transformed life on the island by introducing new agricultural techniques. Other landmarks include a standing stone, an Iron Age broch, a souterrain and a salt-water shower.|$|E
5|$|The flora of Scotland is an {{assemblage}} of native plant species including over 1,600 vascular plants, more than 1,500 lichens and nearly 1,000 bryophytes. The total number of vascular species is low by world standard but lichens and bryophytes are abundant and the latter form a population of global importance. Various populations of rare fern exist, although the impact of 19th-century collectors threatened the existence of several species. The flora is generally typical of the north west European part of the Palearctic ecozone and <b>prominent</b> <b>features</b> of the Scottish flora include boreal Caledonian forest (much reduced from its natural extent), heather moorland and coastal machair. In addition to the native varieties of vascular plants there are numerous non-native introductions, now believed to make up some 43% of the species in the country.|$|E

5|$|From around 2000 to 800BC, {{the people}} of the Bronze Age built the 1,400 Bronze Age round barrows that are known to exist on the Yorkshire Wolds. These are found both in {{isolation}} and grouped together to form cemeteries. Many of these sites can still be seen as <b>prominent</b> <b>features</b> in the present-day landscape. By the later Bronze Age, an open, cleared, landscape predominated on the Wolds. It was used for grazing and also for arable cultivation. The wetlands {{on either side of the}} Wolds in the River Hull valley, Holderness and the Vale of York were also being used for animal rearing at this time. In the Iron Age there were further cultural changes in the area. There emerged a distinctive local tradition known as the Arras Culture, named after a site at Arras, near Market Weighton. There are similarities between the chariot burials of the Arras Culture and groups of La Tene burials in northern Europe, where the burial of carts was also practised. The area became the kingdom of the tribe known as the Parisi.|$|E
5|$|Tethys is {{the third}} largest of Saturn's inner moons. Its most <b>prominent</b> <b>features</b> are a large (400km diameter) impact crater named Odysseus on its leading {{hemisphere}} and a vast canyon system named Ithaca Chasma extending at least 270° around Tethys. The Ithaca Chasma is concentric with Odysseus, and these two features may be related. Tethys appears to have no current geological activity. A heavily cratered hilly terrain occupies {{the majority of its}} surface, while a smaller and smoother plains region lies on the hemisphere opposite to that of Odysseus. The plains contain fewer craters and are apparently younger. A sharp boundary separates them from the cratered terrain. There is also a system of extensional troughs radiating away from Odysseus. The density of Tethys (0.985g/cm3) is less than that of water, indicating that it is made mainly of water ice with {{only a small fraction of}} rock.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} <b>prominent</b> <b>features</b> on the ECG: the P wave (atrial depolarisation), the QRS complex (ventricular depolarisation) and the T wave (ventricular repolarisation). As the heart cells contract, {{they create a}} current that travels through the heart. A {{downward}} deflection on the ECG implies cells are becoming more positive in charge ("depolarising") {{in the direction of}} that lead, whereas an upward inflection implies cells are becoming more negative ("repolarising") {{in the direction of the}} lead. This depends on the position of the lead, so if a wave of depolarising moved from left to right, a lead on the left would show a negative deflection, and a lead on the right would show a positive deflection. The ECG is a useful tool in detecting rhythm disturbances and in detecting insufficient blood supply to the heart. Sometimes abnormalities are suspected, but not immediately visible on the ECG. Testing when exercising can be used to provoke an abnormality, or an ECG can be worn for a longer period such as a 24-hour Holter monitor if a suspected rhythm abnormality is not present at the time of assessment.|$|E

25|$|Great Zimbabwe is {{believed}} to have served as a royal palace for the local monarch. As such, it would have been used as the seat of political power. Among the edifice's most <b>prominent</b> <b>features</b> were its walls, some of which were over five metres high. They were constructed without mortar (dry stone). Eventually, the city was abandoned and fell into ruin.|$|E

25|$|The {{centre of}} this {{rectangular}} Renaissance palace was the vaulted palace church, with surrounding rooms connected by open arcades and loggias. The choirs {{of the church}} possibly had ogive and rose windows like those at Vadstena Castle. Characteristic of the palaces built during this era were towers and pinnacles with adorned hoods, bay windows, arcades, and galleries and these were probably also <b>prominent</b> <b>features</b> of the Renaissance palace at Drottningholm.|$|E
25|$|The most <b>prominent</b> <b>features</b> of Greek {{life at the}} {{university}} are the large, mostly Greek Revival style mansions maintained by the national fraternities and sororities as chapter houses. Lining Lincoln Street, Gadsden Street, and Mark Buyck Way are the houses {{referred to as the}} Greek Village. All students who live in these residences are members of a sorority or fraternity, and while the properties are managed by {{the university}}, each house is privately owned by a fraternity or sorority.|$|E
25|$|At {{midnight on}} July 6–7, Egyptian forces began a {{bombardment}} of Nitzanim from the Cemetery Hill using Bofors cannons and 25-pounders, and at 06:00, a close-range bombardment using anti-tank guns. All of the <b>prominent</b> <b>features</b> {{in the village}} were destroyed. An additional mortar bombardment took place from a southeastern position, and a 6-pounder shelling from the water tank hill in the south. Shortly after, an attack was attempted from the east, but it was repelled and the water tank hill remained under Israeli control.|$|E

25|$|The wooded {{ridgeline}} of Farmington Mountain is less distinct {{that its}} neighboring peaks on the Metacomet Ridge. Nonetheless, the mountain contains {{a number of}} <b>prominent</b> <b>features.</b> The historic Hill-Stead Museum, known for its French Impressionist masterpieces, architecture, and stately grounds {{is located on the}} northern part of the ridgeline. The southern half of the mountain is made up of largely wooded cliffs; the Farmington Reservoir is nestled between the ridge high point and the edge of the lower plateau. Other parts of the mountain are occupied by suburban housing.|$|E
25|$|For {{certain of}} the novel's <b>prominent</b> <b>features,</b> Prus, the {{conscientious}} journalist and scholar, seems to have insisted on having two sources, one of them based on personal or at least contemporary experience. One such dually-determined feature relates to Egyptian beliefs about an afterlife. In 1893, the year before beginning his novel, Prus the skeptic had started taking an intense interest in Spiritualism, attending Warsaw séances which featured the Italian medium, Eusapia Palladino—the same medium whose Paris séances, a dozen years later, would be attended by Pierre and Marie Curie. Palladino {{had been brought to}} Warsaw from a St. Petersburg mediumistic tour by Prus' friend Ochorowicz.|$|E
25|$|The ridge rises {{only about}} 40 feet (12 m) above the {{surrounding}} terrain and is under 2 miles (3.2km) long. The northern end rises to become Cemetery Hill, the southern descends to low, wooded, and sometimes marshy ground {{just north of}} Little Round Top. At {{the northern end of}} Cemetery Ridge is a copse of trees and a low stone wall that makes two 90-degree turns; the latter has been nicknamed The Angle and the High Water Mark of the Confederacy. This area, and the nearby Codori Farm on Emmitsburg Road, were <b>prominent</b> <b>features</b> in the progress of Pickett's Charge during the third day of battle, as well as Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's division assault on the second.|$|E

25|$|The three {{kilometre}} (1.9 mile) round-trip, {{hiking trail}} on Partridge Island climbs quickly to {{a height of}} about 61 metres (200 feet) above sea level, but there are four benches to rest on. There is a lookoff {{at the top of}} the trail from which a viewing platform offers vistas of more than 60 kilometres (37 miles) of the coastline of the Upper Minas Basin. <b>Prominent</b> <b>features</b> include Cape Blomidon, Cape Split, Cape Sharp, Cape d'Or, and Cobequid Bay. At dusk many lighthouses can be seen on the coasts surrounding Partridge Island. Visitors are advised to stay on the trail and to keep away from the edge of the cliffs, which could give way without warning.|$|E
25|$|As part of Wright's {{transitional}} {{decade of}} the 1890s the Furbeck House is significant {{as the beginning of}} a three-year period of experimentation by the architect which resulted in the first fully modern style residential buildings. The George Furbeck House connects Wright's early period, which included geometric Queen Anne houses such as the Robert P. Parker House, with his fully mature Prairie style which resulted in early modern homes such as the Heurtley House. <b>Prominent</b> <b>features</b> reminiscent of Wright's early work includes the octagon towers; a shape he was exploring throughout his transitional decade. The home's rectilinear massing, hip roof, casement windows and horizontal sill course all featured extensively in later Prairie style homes by Wright.|$|E
25|$|Two {{substantial}} foghorns {{with concrete}} housings {{were built in}} 1866, one {{at the north end}} of the island near the Swine Cave reached by 'the Loups' path and the other at East Trammins on the south end. Both were powered by compressed air that was piped from the lighthouse, where a gas powered compressor was housed until 1911 when oil-powered engines were installed. One of the compressed air pipelines can still be seen within 'the Loups' path that was constructed above it. The compressed air cylinders that held the required store of air are still <b>prominent</b> <b>features,</b> especially at the Trammins foghorn. Both foghorns were decommissioned in 1966 and a Tyfon fog signal was used until 1987 when improvements in ship navigation made it also redundant.|$|E
