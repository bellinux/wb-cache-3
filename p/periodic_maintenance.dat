40|$|This paper {{considers}} a <b>periodic</b> preventive <b>maintenance</b> policy under which each preventive maintenance (PM) reduces the hazard {{rate of the}} repairable system, while keeping the pattern of hazard rate unchanged. For this model, the hazard rate {{at a given time}} t is affected by the improvement factor which depends on the number of PMs conducted until t. In addition to the <b>periodic</b> preventive <b>maintenance,</b> the system undergoes the minimal repair at each failure between the preventive maintenances. We derive mathematical formulas to evaluate the expected cost rate per unit time by computing the expected number of failures depending on the hazard rate of the underlying life distribution of the system. Assuming that the system is replaced by a new one at the N-th preventive maintenance, the optimal values of N and the preventive maintenance period, which minimize the expected cost rate, are solved and thus the best schedules for the <b>periodic</b> preventive <b>maintenance</b> policy are established. Explicit solutions for the optimal schedule for the <b>periodic</b> preventive <b>maintenance</b> are presented when the failure times follow the Weibull distribution. <b>Periodic</b> preventive <b>maintenance,</b> minimal repair, improvement factor, hazard rate, expected cost rate...|$|R

5|$|Another fleet {{operation}} {{took place}} on 18–19 October, though it ended without encountering any British units. Unit training in the Baltic was then conducted, and on the return voyage the III Squadron was diverted {{to assist in the}} recovery of a pair of U-boats stranded on the Danish coast. The fleet was reorganized on 1 December; the four König-class battleships remained in the III Squadron, along with the newly commissioned , while the five Kaiser-class ships, including König Albert, were transferred to IV Squadron. König Albert saw no major operations {{in the first half of}} 1917, and on 18 August she went into drydock at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel for <b>periodic</b> <b>maintenance,</b> which lasted until 23 September.|$|E
5|$|Georgia was {{transferred}} to the Pacific Fleet shortly thereafter, departing from Boston on 16 July 1919. She transited the Panama Canal and arrived in San Diego, where she became the flagship of the 2nd Division, 1st Squadron. The ship went to the Mare Island Navy Yard for <b>periodic</b> <b>maintenance</b> on 20 September. The ship remained there until 15 July 1920 when she was decommissioned. Under the terms of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, the ship was sold for scrapping on 1 November 1923 and subsequently was broken up. The ship was formally stricken from the naval register on 10 November.|$|E

5|$|Another fleet advance {{followed}} on 18–20 October, {{though it}} ended without encountering any British units. Two weeks later, on 4 November, Kaiser {{took part in}} an expedition to the western coast of Denmark to assist two U-boats— and —that had become stranded there. On 1 December, the High Seas Fleet was reorganized; Kaiser and her sisters were transferred to the newly created IV Battle Squadron, with Kaiser as the flagship. In 1917, the policy of unrestricted submarine warfare was reinstated; the surface units of the German navy were therefore tasked with covering the departures and arrivals of the U-boats. As a result, Kaiser {{spent most of the}} year on picket duty in the German Bight. In May 1917, Kaiser went into the dock for <b>periodic</b> <b>maintenance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arkansas {{arrived in}} Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 7 October, after which she {{took part in}} {{exercises}} for a week.

She returned to the New York Navy Yard on 12 December, for additional maintenance. The repairs were completed within a month, and on 16 January 1915, Arkansas departed for the Virginia Capes for exercises on 19–21 January. The ship then steamed down to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba for exercises with the fleet. Arkansas returned for training off Hampton Roads on 7 April, followed by another maintenance period at the New York Navy Yard, starting on 23 April.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Deutschland and Admiral Graf Spee were deployed to the Atlantic {{to put them in}} position to attack Allied merchant traffic once war was declared. Admiral Scheer remained in port for <b>periodic</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Deutschland was not particularly successful on her raiding sortie, during which she sank or captured three ships. She then returned to Germany where she was renamed Lützow. Admiral Graf Spee sank nine vessels in the South Atlantic before she was confronted by three British cruisers at the Battle of the River Plate. Although she damaged the British ships severely, she was herself damaged and her engines were in poor condition. Coupled with false reports of British reinforcements, the state of the ship convinced Hans Langsdorff, her commander, to scuttle the ship outside Montevideo.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the preventive maintenance and inventory control {{problem of a}} one-machine, one-product manufacturing system subject to random breakdowns. Both preventive and corrective interventions have random and non-negligible durations during which an excess of final products inventory is necessary to fulfill demand. The objective {{of this study is}} to find the production rate and the preventive maintenance schedule that minimize the total cost of maintenance and inventory/backlog in the case of <b>periodic</b> preventive <b>maintenance.</b> A near-optimal policy characterization with a simple structure is carried out using a numerical approach. Such a policy is a combination of a hedging point policy and a modified <b>periodic</b> preventive <b>maintenance</b> strategy, under which preventive maintenance actions are performed only if the inventory level exceeds a sufficient level. A simulation-based experimental approach is adopted to achieve a close approximation of the optimal control parameters. It is concluded from a sensitivity analysis and a comparative analysis that the near-optimal control policy leads to a significant cost reduction as compared to the combination of a hedging point policy and a classical <b>periodic</b> preventive <b>maintenance</b> policy.

5|$|Both ships served {{extensively}} on foreign stations; Emden {{was assigned to}} the East Asia Squadron from her commissioning, and Dresden was sent to Caribbean waters in 1913. Dresden was due to return to Germany for <b>periodic</b> <b>maintenance</b> shortly before the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but this became impossible with the onset of hostilities. She therefore operated as a commerce raider, before linking up with Vizeadmiral Maximilian von Spee's East Asia Squadron. Dresden thereafter participated in the Battle of Coronel in November 1914 and the Battle of the Falkland Islands the following December. She was the only German vessel to escape destruction at the latter engagement, and she remained at large for several more months. Dresden finally put into the Chilean island of Más a Tierra in March 1915 owing to worn-out engines. A pair of British cruisers violated Chilean neutrality and attacked Dresden while she lay at anchor; the Germans scuttled their ship to prevent her capture.|$|E
5|$|Gorizia {{returned}} to Taranto in late January 1941. She conducted maneuvers with Zara on 29 January; she {{then went to}} La Spezia for <b>periodic</b> <b>maintenance,</b> which lasted from 28 February to 7 May. Pola took {{her place in the}} 1st Division, and all three of her sisters were sunk in the Battle of Cape Matapan on 28 March. Since the 1st Division had been effectively wiped out at Cape Matapan, Gorizia was reassigned to the 3rd Division on 8 May, along with the three s. The ships, based in Messina, began escorting convoys to North Africa that month, the first of which took place from 26 to 28 May. Another convoy departed Italy on 25 June, escorted by Gorizia, , and a squadron of destroyers. The convoy, which consisted of requisitioned transatlantic liners, steamed to Tripoli and back, arriving in Taranto on 1 July. On 23 August, the main fleet sortied to intercept the British Force H, though they failed to locate their opponent.|$|E
5|$|Grosser Kurfürst {{participated in}} a fleet advance into the North Sea from 29 until 31 May which ended without combat. The ship covered a minelaying {{operation}} on 11–12 September off Texel. Another uneventful fleet advance followed on 23–24 October. Grosser Kurfürst ended the year with a two-week training cruise in the Baltic, which lasted from 5 to 20 December. Another round of exercises in the Baltic followed on 18–23 January 1916. Grosser Kurfürst went into drydock in Wilhelmshaven for <b>periodic</b> <b>maintenance</b> on 12 February. Work lasted until 3 March; two days later the ship sailed for a sweep into the Hoofden, though this again failed to encounter any British forces. The fleet conducted another sortie on 23 March to the Amrun Bank, followed by another a month later to Horns Reef on 21–22 April.|$|E

Cormoran departed Sydney on 23 May, bound for Germany; she reached Kiel on 13 September. While in Germany, she served {{a stint in the}} main fleet. The ship was modernized during a lengthy reconstruction that started in 1907 at the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig. New boilers manufactured by J W Klawitter in Danzig were installed, and her sailing rig was reduced. A new, larger conning tower was also installed. Work was completed in 1908, and on 1 May 1909, Cormoran was recommissioned for service in the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|In May 1898, Diederichs sent Kaiser to Nagasaki for <b>periodic</b> <b>maintenance.</b> The Spanish–American War, {{which saw}} {{action in the}} Philippines at the Battle of Manila Bay, necessitated a German naval {{presence}} {{in the area to}} protect German nationals. Kaiser was still in Nagasaki undergoing repairs, so Diederichs ordered her and Prinzess Wilhelm, also in dock for maintenance, to meet him in Manila as soon as was possible. Crew transfers during the repair process necessitated Irene and Cormoran to meet in Manila as well; this concentration of five warships in the Philippines caused a serious crisis with the American Navy. Rear Admiral George Dewey objected {{to the size of the}} German force and to a meeting between Diederichs and Governor General Augustin, the Spanish governor of the Philippines.

40|$|Proyecto de graduación (Maestría en Ingeniería Vial) Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, EScuela de Ingeniería en Construcción. 2015. This project {{presents}} a technical, economic and {{statistical analysis of}} four typical <b>periodic</b> road <b>maintenance</b> activities used in Costa Rica, as defined in Law No. 7798, which were applied for thin asphalt overlays. The first activity consisted in patching before placing a 5 cm asphalt overlay. The second consisted of sealing cracks prior to a 5 cm asphalt overlay, the third consisted of a 5 cm asphalt overlay over the existing pavement {{and the last one}} implied milling 5 cm and placing a 5 cm asphalt overlay Every technique was applied on a homogeneous section located in the Control Section No. 20811 of National Road No. 135, between kilometers 5 + 210 to 6 + 810, chosen because, according to the geo-penetrating radar (GPR), it presented a similar typology type such as thickness of the pavement structure and a consistent state of the pavement surface, according to the Pavement Index Condition (PCI) analysis. The problem was that, in Costa Rica, there is no technical definition for optimizing <b>periodic</b> road <b>maintenance</b> interventions used to improve the structural and functional state of the national routes, which results in a deficiency investment in public works. The technical and economic assessment was to measure the values of evenness or comfort felt by users, defined by IRI indicator, and deflections of the pavement measured by the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD), together with the quality note “Q”, which re{{presents a}} rating {{of the quality of the}} pavement. This work was performed before and after applied the four <b>periodic</b> road <b>maintenance</b> activities, in order to get the benefit assigned to each of them, using the percentage of improvement in road indicators along with the cost assigned to each activity. The statistical evaluation was concentrated on analysis "ANOVA + Tukey" and the test "paired t", with the intention of determining the consistency and validity of the data resulted of the vials indicators. It was evident that placing thin asphalt overlays showed no improvement in the structural conditions (deflection) of the section of research, because the cost-benefit ratios did not exceed 0, 35 for the four activities, where from values of 1, 00 can be considered positive results. However, it was shown that placing thin asphalt overlays did reveal an improvement in the operating conditions (IRI) of the section of research, because the cost-benefit ratios exceeded 1, 25 and for the milling and asphalt overlay it reached 1, 91, which demonstrate that it is the most efficient one in comparison with the other three <b>periodic</b> road <b>maintenance</b> activities. Finally, these findings establish that the milling pavement plus the thin asphalt overlay provide the best option for investment the state funds in <b>periodic</b> road <b>maintenance</b> in public works.
