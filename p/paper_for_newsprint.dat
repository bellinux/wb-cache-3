30|$|To {{clarify the}} {{socioeconomic}} factors influencing global paper and paperboard demand, a panel data {{analysis was conducted}} covering the period 1961 – 2014. This study used paper and paperboard demand as the dependent variable, and a country’s economic level, Internet usage rate, plastic packaging demand, and time trend as the explanatory variables. An inverse U-shaped quadratic relationship, such as an environmental Kuznets curve, was found between economic level and paper and paperboard demand, which saturates and begins to decline as economic level increases. The economic level representing the turning point differs significantly with the use, ranging from around 37, 000 US$/person <b>for</b> <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper</b> to around 66, 000 US$/person for printing and writing <b>paper.</b> <b>For</b> both <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper</b> and printing and writing paper, demand declines owing {{to the spread of}} the Internet as the economic level rises, although this reductive effect is greater for printing and writing <b>paper</b> than <b>for</b> <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper.</b> A substitution relationship is not found between wrapping paper and corrugated cardboard {{on the one hand and}} plastic packaging on the other hand as the economic level becomes higher.|$|R

30|$|The results (Table  3) of {{the panel}} data {{analysis}} by model (5) show that newsprint paper and printing and writing paper have a substitution relationship with the Internet as the economic level rises. However, the reductive effect of Internet use on printing and writing paper begins to manifest at a relatively low economic level while the effect on newsprint paper is not observed until the economic level has risen substantially. Specifically, the economic levels are 14, 183 US$/person or more [(7.29 e− 05  −  5.14 e− 09  ×  14, 182) >  0  > (7.29 e− 05  −  5.14 e− 09  ×  14, 183)] and 21, 189 US$/person or more [(5.17 e− 05  −  2.44 e− 09  ×  21, 188) >  0  > (5.17 e− 05  −  2.44 e− 09  ×  21, 189)], respectively. Conversely, Hujala [19] reported that {{the spread of the}} Internet has reduced demand <b>for</b> <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper,</b> but has had a negligible impact on the demand for printing and writing paper. Latta et al. [20] showed that the spread of the Internet has driven the decline in demand <b>for</b> <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper,</b> while only in the United States and other OECD countries has the demand for printing and writing <b>paper</b> also decreased. <b>For</b> our analysis, we covered more countries and more recent years (104 countries for the period 1990 – 2014) than previous studies have (50 countries for the period 1990 – 2007 [19]; 6 major world regions for the period 1970 – 2011 [20]). As a result, we surmise that globally in recent years, a substitution relationship with Internet use is observed both <b>for</b> <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper</b> and <b>for</b> printing and writing paper. However, because the models used for the regression analysis differ from those of previous studies, more detailed comparison between them is difficult. In newsprint paper, {{there is a possibility that}} as per capita GDP increased, the per capita demand decreased for the period 1990 – 2014 from the results (Table  3) by model (5). When we conducted the regression analysis using only per capita GDP as the explanatory variable for that period for model (5), the regression coefficient for per capita GDP was negative, confirming the statistical significance. This indicates that the demand <b>for</b> <b>newsprint</b> decreased as economic level rose in recent years after 1990. Looking at the time trend, in newsprint paper, the regression coefficient for the time trend was negative and was confirmed to be statistically significant. This demonstrates the presence of other factors with a reductive effect on demand, such as advances in technology for reducing the weight of newsprint paper, the reorientation towards digital media in the advertising industry, and improvement of Internet line speed. Meanwhile, in printing and writing paper, the time trend was not statistically significant, indicating that the impact on demand from other factors with a time trend is insignificant.|$|R

40|$|Mill-scale {{demonstration}} {{of a process}} concept inspired by Process Intensification (PI) principles was performed in Holmen Paper Braviken mill, Norrkoping, Sweden. The intensified process consists of wood softening by means of chip pretreatment with sodium sulphite, high intensity refining followed by low consistency refining.
