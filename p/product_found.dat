2500|$|A thermogenic {{is a broad}} {{term for}} any {{supplement}} that the manufacturer claims will cause thermogenesis, resulting in increased body temperature, increased metabolic rate, and consequently an increased rate in the burning of body fat and weight loss.

However, on February 6, 2004 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the sale of ephedra and its alkaloid, ephedrine, for use in weight loss formulas. Several manufacturers replaced the ephedra component of the [...] "ECA" [...] stack with bitter orange or citrus aurantium (containing synephrine) instead of the ephedrine.|$|E
2500|$|A second {{important}} step was {{the synthesis of}} organic compounds. Whereas the synthesis of inorganic substances had been {{known for a long}} time, the synthesis of organic substances was a difficult hurdle. In 1827 the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius held that an indispensable force of nature for the synthesis of organic compounds, called vital force or life force, was needed. This philosophical idea, vitalism, well into the 19th century had many supporters, even after the introduction of the atomic theory. The idea of vitalism especially fitted in with beliefs in medicine; the most traditional healing practices believed that disease was the result of some imbalance in the vital energies that distinguishes life from nonlife. A first attempt to break the vitalism idea in science was made in 1828, when the German chemist Friedrich Wöhler succeeded in synthesizing urea, a natural <b>product</b> <b>found</b> in urine, by heating ammonium cyanate, an inorganic substance: ...|$|E

2500|$|... (+)-Discodermolide is a polyketide natural <b>product</b> <b>found</b> to {{stabilize}} microtubule. (+)-discodermolide was isolated by Gunasekera {{and his co-workers}} at the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute from the deep-sea sponge Discodermia dissoluta in 1990. (+)-Discodermolide {{was found to be}} a potent inhibitor of tumor cell growth in several MDR cancer cell lines. [...] (+)-discodermolide also shows some unique characters, including a linear backbone structure, immunosuppressive properties both in vitro and in vivo, potent induction of an accelerated senescence phenotype, and synergistic antiproliferative activity in combination with paclitaxel. Discodermolide was {{recognized as one of the}} most potent natural promoters of tubulin assembly. A large number of efforts toward the total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide were directed by its interesting biological activities and extreme scarcity of natural sources (0.002% w/w from frozen marine sponge). The compound supply necessary for complete clinical trials cannot be met by harvesting, isolation, and purification. As of 2005, attempts at synthesis or semi-synthesis by fermentation have proven unsuccessful. As a result, all discodermolide used in preclinical studies and clinical trials has come from large-scale total synthesis.|$|E
