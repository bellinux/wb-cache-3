Regardless of the advances being made in noise control technology, Iranian industry still relies heavily on hearing protection devices (HPDs) to reduce occupational noise exposures to acceptable limits. This study investigated the occurrence of standard threshold shift (STS) among workers of a metal industry using audiometric data and noise measurement levels. Methods: The exposure to noise was determined for each workplace by the direct or indirect measurements of noise levels. The choice of the method depended on the variability of the noise. Exposure to steady-state noise was assessed {{on the basis of}} measurement 8 hours TWA. Exposure to non steady-state noise was measured directly by noise-dose meter. The baseline and periodic audiometric results of 2016 workers exposed to noise TWA 85 dB or Dose 50 % and above from different plant areas performed by the company routinely according to the Iranian health ministry Law were analyzed for the standard threshold shift (STS). Result: Workers frequency of HPD use reported by company hygienist or safety officer on a 3 -point scale (seldom= 189, sometime= 865, always= 962) {{on the basis of their}} observation. The finding shows that was relation between STS and age but not with tenure (P< 0. 05). There was dependence between STS with noise level, time exposure, and HPDs wearing time (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Background A {{considerable}} amount of research has been published about genetic hearing impairment. Fifty to sixty <b>percent</b> of <b>hearing</b> loss {{is thought to have}} a genetic cause. Genes may also {{play a significant role in}} acquired hearing loss due to aging, noise exposure, or ototoxic medications. Between 1995 and 2012, over 100 causative genes have been identified for syndromic and nonsyndromic forms of hereditary hearing loss (see Hereditary Hearing Loss Homepage [URL] Mouse models have been extremely valuable in facilitating the discovery of hearing loss genes, and in understanding inner ear pathology due to genetic mutations or elucidating fundamental mechanisms of inner ear development. Purpose Whereas much is being learned about hereditary hearing loss and the genetics of cochlear disorders, relatively little is known about the role genes may play in peripheral vestibular impairment. Here we review the literature with regard to genetics of vestibular dysfunction and discuss what we have learned from studies using mutant mouse models and direct measures of peripheral vestibular neural function. Results Several genes are considered that when mutated lead to varying degrees of inner ear vestibular dysfunction due to deficits in otoconia, stereocilia, hair cells, or neurons. Behavior often does not reveal the inner ear deficit. Many of the examples presented are also known to cause human disorders. Conclusions Knowledge regarding the roles of particular genes in the operation of the vestibular sensory apparatus is growing and it is clear that gene products co-expressed in the cochlea and vestibule may play different roles in the respective end organs. The discovery of new genes mediating critical inner ear vestibular function carries the promise of new strategies in diagnosing, treating and managing patients as well as predicting the course and level of morbidity in human vestibular disease...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} job {{development and}} vocational training {{for persons with}} hearing impairments in Taiwan and reports on a survey of 26 individuals just graduated or about to graduate with hearing impairment. Discussion includes an historical overview and examination {{of the concept of}} transition in Taiwan and transition to employment for people with hearing impairments. The data on the 26 students were abstracted from a 2000 study of 202 students, "Study of Career Self-concept and Transition Services for Youth with Disabilities in Taiwan " (Lin, Chen, and Lin). The Career Transition Needs Scale, adapted to the Taiwanese situation, was used. Findings indicated that most (92 <b>percent)</b> of the <b>hearing</b> impaired youth did not attend the Individualized Transition Plan (ITP) meeting and did not receive a quality transition curriculum. Most schools failed to develop ITPs for these students and also did not develop interagency cooperative efforts. Students who did not work were more likely to receive a better transition curriculum and relied more on interagency cooperation. Currently employed youth relied less on transition services offered by their school and relied more on their own abilities. Previously employed youth were most likely to request vocational guidance services. Eleven suggestions for improving transition services to this population are offered.

40|$|Orchestral {{musicians are}} an at-risk {{population}} for noise-induced hearing loss. Following strategic approaches to mitigate exposure, many must use earplugs to safeguard their hearing, although reported usage rates are poor. Australia has progressive hearing conservation programs within {{many of its}} orchestras, yet little is known of earplug usage rates, abilities with earplugs or self-perceived hearing loss in this population. To help direct and inform future approaches to hearing conservation in Australia′s orchestras a questionnaire assessing hearing conservation behaviors and the prevalence of self-perceived hearing loss was distributed. A total of 580 musicians across eight professional orchestras were surveyed, with 367 completed surveys (63 %) returned. Eighty percent of respondents reported a risk of hearing damage in the orchestra, 64 % used earplugs of some type {{at least some of}} the time and 83 % found this use difficult/impossible. Forty-three <b>percent</b> reported a <b>hearing</b> loss, including 54 % in pit orchestras and 46 % of those ≤ 50 years of age. Brass players were least likely to use earplugs, most likely to report usage difficulties and most likely of those ≤ 50 years of age to report a hearing loss. While earplug usage rates in Australia are encouraging and may be linked to hearing conservation measures in the orchestras, the widespread difficulty reported with the use of these earplugs, the prevalence of self-reported hearing loss and the continued vulnerability of those most at-risk indicate improvements in both earplug design and further education for musicians are required to progress hearing conservation options for this population...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hearing loss is a sensorineural {{impairment}} {{and is one}} of the most widespread congenital impairments with a prevalence of one in thousand among children. Studies have shown that 50 <b>percent</b> of congenital <b>hearing</b> loss have genetic causes and the remaining 50 percent are due to environment and unknown reasons; in addition, it is noted that this impairment is very heterogeneous. Almost 70 percent of cases are nonsyndromic with hearing loss presenting as the only impairment. About 80 percent of this type of hearing loss is inherited in recessive manner (ARNSHL). In this study, we determined the role of DFNB 63 locus in a series of families in two western provinces of Iran. Methods: In this descriptive-laboratory study, to determine the prevalence of DFNB 63 mutations in western provinces of Iran, we studied 150 individuals from 30 families in Hamadan and Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad provinces. The selected families in this study were consanguineous, had at least 2 patients, and were negative for GJB 2 mutations. Linkage analysis was performed using six appropriate short tandem repeats (STR) markers. Findings: With linkage analysis of selected families, no family was shown to be linked to the DFNB 63 locus. It was shown that the LRTOMT mutations played no role in causing hearing loss in the studied families. Conclusion: The present study suggests that LRTOMT mutations may not be clinically important in causing autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss in the investigated provinces. © 2015, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences(IUMS).

Moreover, it is noticeable that there exists a typical type of hearing impairment, namely the type that decends abruptly just at 8000 cps. 3) The appearance of such disturbances is greatly correlated with individual susceptibility, namely, with his congenital factor. 4) The early discovery of these disturbances can only be attained by frequent and scrutinous examinations of hearing. 5) As for the prognosis of these disturbances, the cessation of the administration of this drug after a relatively early discovery can sometimes improve the conditions though slightly. 6) Though there are hardly any cases whose tinitus as well as the hearingloss have improved after the treatments by VB(1), VA, a decrease or disappearance only of tinitus with a subsequent improvement in subjective hearing has been recognized in some cases...|$|R
40|$|Educationists are of {{the opinion}} that the {{educational}} problems relating to quantity and quality could be tackled by the proper utilization of instructional technology. Instructional technology is a systematic way of designing, carrying out and evaluating the teaching learning process. Instructional technology makes instruction more effective, understandable and meaningful. All types of resources are used to make the learning easy. Traditional teacher-centered approach in the classroom has been shifted from teaching to learning. It is called student centered or resource-based approach, the student being the resource. Learning through hearing alone proves to be the least effective means of learning. One learns eleven <b>percent</b> by <b>hearing</b> as against eighty-three percent by seeing. As for as retention of hearing is concerned, learning through hearing again stands at the lowest ebb because after three days, we recall only ten percent of what we learn through hearing as against fifty percent of what we learn through both hearing and seeing, and ninety percent of what we acquire by applying three of our senses i. e seeing, hearing and doing. The major objectives of the study were, (i) to find the relative effectiveness of instructional techniligy in teaching biology at secondary level to students of experimental group and control group and (ii) to see the difference of treatment effects between the students of low achievers and high achievers and high achievers, (iii) to see the difference of treatment effects between the students of the control and experimental groups on the variable of retention. The researcher selected the students of 10 th class of the Federal government Girls Secondary School No. 6 and two groups (experimental and control) were randomly secured from total available group. The equivalence of the groups was determined by equating the students of both groups on the pre-test scores. Four chapters of biology were taught during the experiment of both experimental and control groups by two different teachers almost of the same qualification and experience and were intended to measure the outcomes of learning. The post-test was administered to both groups after twelve weeks. The retention test was administered after twelve weeks of the post-test. In order to secure data, pre-test and retention rest were administered as research instrument. Data were tabulated, analyzed and interpreted in the light of objectives of the study. In order to see the significance of the results, test of significance such as t-test were applied. The study is significant because findings identified the effectiveness of instructional technology and weakness of traditional approach at secondary level in teaching biology. The analysis revealed that the application of instructional technology as supplementary strategy in teaching biology was more effective because the use of instructional technology increased interest and enhanced motivation levels. Instructional technology as supplementary strategy was also found to be equally effective for low achievers and high achievers. On the basis of findings, researcher provided workable suggestions/recommendations for enhancing the effective learning of students of biology at secondary level...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Increasing {{survival}} of extremely {{low birth weight}} (ELBW; birth weight < 1000 g) infants raises a concern regarding the risks of adverse long-term outcome such as cognitive dysfunction. Few studies have reported long-term follow-up of representative regional cohorts. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the 5 -year outcome of a prospectively followed national ELBW infant cohort. Methods. Of all live-born ELBW infants (n = 351) who were delivered in the 2 -year period 1996 - 1997 in Finland, 206 (59 %) survived until the age of 5 years. Of these, 103 were born at < 27 gestational weeks (GW). A total of 172 children were assessed with neurocognitive tests (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - Revised and a Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment [NEPSY]). Nine children with cognitive impairment and inability to cooperate in testing were not assessed. Motor development was assessed with a modified Touwen test. Results. The rate of cognitive impairment in the ELBW survivors was 9 %. The rate of cerebral palsy was 14 % (19 % of ELBW infants who were born at < 27 GW). The mean full-scale IQ of the assessed children was 96 +/- 19 and in children of GW < 27 was 94 +/- 19. Attention, language, sensorimotor, visuospatial, and verbal memory values of NEPSY assessment were significantly poorer compared with normal population means. Four <b>percent</b> needed a <b>hearing</b> aid, and 30 % had ophthalmic findings. Of 21 children who had been treated with laser/cryo for retinopathy of prematurity, 17 (81 %) had abnormal ophthalmic findings. Of the whole cohort, 41 (20 %) exhibited major disabilities, 38 (19 %) exhibited minor disabilities, and 124 (61 %) showed development with no functional abnormalities but subtle departures from the norm. Only 53 (26 %) of the total ELBW infant cohort were classified to have normal outcome excluding any abnormal ophthalmic, auditory, neurologic, or developmental findings. Being small for gestational age at birth was associated with suboptimal growth at least until age 5. Conclusions. Only one fourth of the ELBW infants were classified as normally developed at age 5. The high rate of cognitive dysfunction suggests an increased risk for learning difficulties that needs to be evaluated at a later age. Extended follow-up should be the rule in outcome studies of ELBW infant cohorts to elucidate the impact of immaturity on school achievement and social behavior later in life...|$|R
40|$|Universal Design (UD) is {{the design}} and {{composition}} of an environment {{so that it can}} be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless oftheir age, size, ability or disability. An environment (or any building, product, or service in that environment) should be designedto meet the needs of all people who wish to use it. This is not a special requirement for the benefit of only a minority of the population. It is a fundamental condition of good design. If an environment is accessible, usable, convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone benefits. By considering the diverse needs and abilities of all throughout the design process, universal design creates products, services and environments that meet peoples’ needs. Simply put, universal design is good design. These principles can, and should be, applied to both built and digital environments in the university context. Universal Design for learning is an area that is important due to its wide ranging positive impacts, such as deeper learning, engaged learners and increased student retention. The principles of UD for learning are based on providing students with multiple means of representation, expression and engagement. If academics provide options and opportunities to learners, so they can experience learning in ways that have meaning to them, there will be multiple benefits. Implementing UD for learning will benefit not only students with a disability, but also a wide range of other students with different language abilities and learning styles. Over 4 million people in Australia have some form of disability, including 16 <b>percent</b> affected by <b>hearing</b> loss, 10 <b>percent</b> with dyslexia, and over a lifetime 45 percent of the population will experience a mental health disorder. In keeping with the theme of visions 20 / 20 – what’s next?, the vision of the team at Disability Services is that USC will be a leading Australian university in the area of UD. This discussion aims to increase the knowledge of USC academics of the principles of UD and how they can be applied in their teaching. Further beneficial information included in this presentation will be relating to processes for Disability Services here at USC. This is due to the growing number of USC students registering with Disability Services, and requests from academics to provide more information regarding our services and how to support students with a disability...|$|R

ShanksCortical-Thalamic Axons are Required for Retinal Ganglion Cell Targeting to the Mouse Dorsal Lateral Geniculate Nucleus	The {{human brain}} {{contains}} over 85 billion neurons, which make trillions of synapses {{in a very}} ordered and stereotypical manner (Williams and Herrup, 1988). The human cerebral cortex, which contains over 20 {{percent of the total}} number of neurons within the brain, is responsible for critical functions such as memory, attention, perception, awareness, language, thought, and consciousness, and it dedicates over 30 percent of the total area to the process of vision, 8 percent for touch, and 3 <b>percent</b> for <b>hearing</b> (Grady et al., 1993). One major question in the field of neuroscience is: how do neurons navigate the extremely complex environment of the developing brain that contains an endless amount of possible synaptic partners and continually, precisely, and stereotypically find their appropriate synaptic targets? Many disorders that affect the human population can be attributed to the loss of the precise wiring within the brain, including mental retardation, schizophrenia, and autism (Tye and Bolton, 2013; Kana et al., 2011; Huttenlocker, 1991; Buchmann et al., 2014). Recent studies that utilized fMRI to investigate brain activity in people who suffer from schizophrenia, a disorder that renders the inflicted an inability to perceive what is real, show a distinct loss of cortical activity in the visual thalamus resulting from a loss of thalamo-cortical circuitry. Elucidating the mechanisms responsible for the proper wiring of the brain is of paramount importance, and could lead to possible remedies for afflictions such as schizophrenia. The mouse visual system has become an increasingly popular model to study the development of neural circuits given the vast genetic tools and the ease with which the output neurons of the retina, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), can be labeled. Multiple distinct targets of RGCs have been well characterized and many behaviors are associated with these nuclei that can be easily assayed to detect for dysfunction (Sweeney et al., 2014; Osterhout et al., 2015). It has been demonstrated that activity is necessary for the refinement of RGCs in the dLGN during development and the proper placement of RGCs within eye specific domains is reliant on specific receptor tyrosine kinases (Rossi et al., 1988; Pfeifenberger et al., 2005). Mounting evidence suggests that specific transmembrane adhesion molecules are necessary for the proper targeting of RGCs to specific visual nuclei responsible for multiple non-image forming behaviors, including circadian rhythms, the pupillary light reflex, and image stabilization (Osterhout et al., 2011; Osterhout et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2015; Su et al., 2011). Molecules necessary for the proper targeting of image forming nuclei including the dLGN and the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain target necessary for reflexive head and eye movements, remain elusive. 	While the retina sends projections to specific subcortical nuclei, many of these same nuclei also receive cortical input from either layer 5 or layer 6 of the visual cortex (V 1). The timing and patterns of innervation of cortical layer 6 neurons in the dLGN has recently been elucidated (Seabrook et al., 2013). These data indicate that the removal of RGC axons from the dLGN during development allows cortical neurons to innervate the dLGN at earlier time points, suggesting RGC axons control the timing of innervation. Whether cortical neurons affect the innervation patterns of RGCs is not well understood. 	In order to better understand the role of V 1 input during the development of the mouse visual system, I utilized a transgenic mouse harboring a floxed conditional allele for a splicing factor that when removed with a cre-recombinase driver line, only expressed in cortical tissue, results in the almost complete loss of the mouse neo-cortex. Surprisingly, the animal is viable and thus allowed me to investigate the necessity of V 1 innervation during the development of the mouse visual system including innervation patterns of RGCs within multiple subcortical nuclei. I was also able to investigate well known non-image forming behaviors, including the pupillary light reflex, to test for the necessity of cortical layer 5 input, and circadian rhythms to better understand if the cortex modulates sleep wake cycles. Also, I tested whether mice lacking cortical input and almost complete loss of RGC inputs to the dLGN can perceive light and whether this perception can be used to locate a cue in a complex environment...|$|R
