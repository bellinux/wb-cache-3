25|$|In the {{exercise}} of its original jurisdiction – that is, its power to hear cases {{for the first time}} – the High Court carries out two types of judicial review: judicial review of legislation, and judicial review of administrative acts. Although in a 1980 case the Privy Council held that the fundamental liberties in Part IV of the Constitution should be interpreted generously, Singapore courts usually adopt a philosophy of deference to Parliament and a strong presumption of constitutional validity, which has led to fundamental liberties being construed narrowly in certain cases. The courts also generally adopt a <b>purposive</b> approach, favouring <b>interpretations</b> that promote the purpose or object underlying constitutional provisions.|$|R
500|$|In {{other common}} law jurisdictions, {{interpretation}} for similar situations is significantly different. In Canada, for example, four different interpretative doctrines {{are used in}} understanding taxation laws; [...] "strict construction, <b>purposive</b> <b>interpretation,</b> the plain meaning rule, and the words-in-total-context approach".

Since then, however, both the purposive and plain meaning approaches have been used. Academics have rejected the idea that legislative history should be an aid to statutory interpretation, arguing, [...] "It would introduce intolerable uncertainty... if clear language in a detailed provision of [...] Act were to be qualified by unexpressed exceptions derived from a court's view of the object and purpose ...|$|E

40|$|Throughout the {{duration}} of the UK’s membership of the European Union (EU), non-implementation and incorrect transposition of Directives has been commonplace. Coupled with the Court of Justice of the European Union’s refusal to extend the direct effect of Directives to horizontal relationships, and historic difficulties in holding States liable in damages, it has often fallen to the national courts to give effect to EU laws through <b>purposive</b> statutory <b>interpretation.</b> Recent cases involving the collective redundancy of workers in the UK (currently awaiting a ruling from the Court of Justice through the preliminary reference procedure), and the High Court’s assessment of State Liability in the insurance sector, raise questions as to the efficacy of the current system of enforcement of EU law domestically. Despite the problems of access to EU rights experienced by workers in the UK, there appears to be hope that the judiciary is becoming more attuned to the relationship between EU and domestic laws, and are willing to take control of granting access to remedies without necessarily waiting for EU institutions to provide express permission or instruction. 2014 was a particularly important year in this regard.

2500|$|In general, {{courts have}} embraced a <b>purposive</b> <b>interpretation</b> of Charter rights. This means that since early cases like Hunter v. Southam (1984) and R. v. Big M Drug Mart (1985), they have {{concentrated}} {{not on the}} traditional, limited understanding of what each right meant when the Charter was adopted in 1982, but rather on changing the scope of rights as appropriate to fit their broader purpose. This {{is tied to the}} generous interpretation of rights, as the purpose of the Charter provisions is assumed to be to increase rights and freedoms of people in a variety of circumstances, {{at the expense of the}} government powers. Constitutional scholar Peter Hogg has approved of the generous approach in some cases, although for others he argues the purpose of the provisions was not to achieve a set of rights as broad as courts have imagined. Indeed, this approach has not been without its critics. Alberta politician Ted Morton and political scientist Rainer Knopff have been very critical of this phenomenon. Although they feel the basis for the approach, the living tree doctrine (the classical name for generous interpretations of the Canadian Constitution), is sound, they argue Charter case law has been more radical. When the living tree doctrine is applied right, the authors claim, [...] "The elm remained an elm; it grew new branches but did not transform itself into an oak or a willow." [...] The doctrine can be used, for example, so a right is upheld even when a government threatens to violate it with new technology, as long as the essential right remains the same; but the authors claim that the courts have used the doctrine to [...] "create new rights." [...] As an example, the authors note that the Charter right against self-incrimination has been extended to cover scenarios in the justice system that had previously been unregulated by self-incrimination rights in other Canadian laws.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{context in}} which the common law left workers {{particularly}} vulnerable was where the business for which they worked was transferred between one person and another. In Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd it was held (albeit to protect the worker from draconian sanctions in the arcane Employers and Workmen Act 1875) that an employment contract could not transfer without the consent of the parties involved. Consequently, in a situation where company A sold its assets (including contracts) to company B, the employment relationship would sever and the only claim a worker would have for dismissal would be against company A. Particularly from the 1950s, the view was increasingly accepted across Europe that workers have something more than a personal right, and akin to a property right in their jobs. Just as the transfer of a freehold property between two landlords would not mean that a tenant could be evicted, the first Transfers of Undertakings Directive, passed in 1978 and updated in 2001 (often still referred to as the [...] "Acquired Rights Directive"), required that a business transferee would have to provide a good economic, technical or organisational reason if they were either to not retain all previous employees, or wanted to make detrimental variations to their workers' contracts. This means that the new employer who is a transferee of a business through an asset sale is in no better position than would be a new owner who gained control of a business by buying out a company's shares: contractual variations require the employees' consent and dismissal rights remain {{as if it were the}} old employer. As implemented by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006, a clear example where employees contracts transfer was in Litster v Forth Dry Dock. The House of Lords held that a <b>purposive</b> <b>interpretation</b> is to be given to the legislation so that where 12 dockworkers were sacked an hour before a business sale, their contracts remained in effect if the employees would still be there in absence of an unfair dismissal. This does not, however, mean that employees unfairly dismissed before a sale have a right to their jobs back, because national law's normal remedy remains with a preference for damages over specific performance. The same principle goes for any variation that works to the detriment of the employee. So the transferee employer may not (without a good business reason) for example, try to impose a single new gardening clause or withdraw tenure, or the employee will have a claim for constructive dismissal.|$|E

British Journal of Politics and International Relations, 6 (3), 292 - 311 RAE 2008 The {{allusion to}} presidentialism in {{relation}} to the status, role and meaning of a prime minister's position is almost invariably skewed towards positive, <b>purposive</b> and expansive <b>interpretations</b> of strong executive authority.

As a consequence, seven strands of usage are identified in the selection of presidentialism as a focus of opposition.

40|$|Transactions {{that claim}} {{inappropriate}} tax benefits are a perennial problem. When the IRS claims a transaction is abusive, courts generally examine whether the taxpayer had a business purpose {{and whether the}} transaction had economic substance (essentially a prospect of profit before taxes). This two-pronged 2 ̆ 2 economic substance doctrine 2 ̆ 2 developed {{from a series of}} Supreme Court cases. Unfortunately, the economic substance doctrine provides a poor proxy for the real question, which was the focus of the early cases-whether the claimed tax results are consistent with Congress 2 ̆ 7 s intent. One important drawback of the shift from a focus on congressional intent to a focus on the taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s intent and the prospect of pre-tax profit is a doctrine that is much easier for taxpayers to manipulate.

40|$|The {{question}} {{driving this}} thesis is {{how should the}} separation of federal judicial power, derived from Chapter III of the Australian Constitution, be interpreted to best achieve the independence and impartiality of federal courts? The interpretation of Chapter III is as hotly debated as it is fundamentally important. Two key viewpoints have emerged in this debate: formalism and functionalism. A formalist test – strictly separating government powers according to definition – limits the permissible powers of federal courts. A functionalist test – hinging validity on whether a power is incompatible with institutional independence and integrity – limits the powers of State courts and of judges in their personal capacities (‘personae designatae’). A rare point of consensus between the two viewpoints is that the separation of judicial power derived from Chapter III should be interpreted {{in a manner that}} achieves its core purpose. This thesis identifies this purpose as judicial independence and impartiality and queries which interpretive approach can best achieve this aim, with a view to contributing to contemporary debates and guiding future developments in the area. The central argument of the thesis is that a new, hybrid approach called purposive formalism presents a legitimate and preferable interpretation of Chapter III, better able to achieve judicial independence and impartiality than either the existing formalist or functionalist tests. The thesis tests {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} formalist, functionalist and <b>purposive</b> formalist <b>interpretations</b> of Chapter III in two case studies. The first case study concerns powers conferred on federal courts under the anti-terrorism control order provisions of the Commonwealth Criminal Code (the ‘Code’), and contrasts formalist and purposive formalist approaches to assessing the Chapter III validity of these provisions. The second case study concerns similar powers conferred on judges personae designatae under the anti-terrorism preventative detention order provisions of the Code, and assesses the relative strengths and weaknesses of purposive formalism and the functionalist incompatibility test in this context. The study as a whole reveals serious weaknesses in the existing approaches. Purposive formalism is consistently supported, not as a perfect or ideal approach, but certainly as a preferable interpretation of Chapter III better able to achieve the independence and impartiality of federal courts...|$|R
40|$|The {{constitutional}} {{landscape in}} New Zealand has undergone significant {{change over the}} last 20 - 35 years to improve the transparency and accountability of decision-making in the three branches of government. While most of these changes are {{a direct result of}} legislation, the constitutional role of the court has also been evolving and has seen the development of judicial review of the substance of the law for consistency with the New Zealand constitution. The orthodox view of the constitution is heavily critical of judicial, or constitutional, review of legislation by the courts and considers it to be an illegitimate encroachment on the domain of Parliament. This paper explores the legitimacy of constitutional review of legislation by the courts, specifically constitutional review of legislation under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (the Bill of Rights Act). To be legitimate, constitutional review by the courts must have both legal authority and be performed consistently with the constitution. This paper observes that s 5 of the Bill of Rights Act has been employed by the courts, without interference from Parliament, to review legislation for consistency with that Act and that the courts use the <b>purposive</b> approach to <b>interpretation</b> and the proportionality analysis to perform such review consistently with the constitution. Finally, the paper explores whether the developing jurisdiction of constitutional review necessitates a new paradigm to define the constitutional relationship between the courts and Parliament because the orthodox view of New Zealand's constitution is no longer supportable as the definitive positio...|$|R
40|$|The {{enactment}} of general anti-avoidance regimes (GAARs) in domestic legislation {{along with the}} analysis of those regimes is well documented with academic studies focusing on {{an examination of the}} introduction and subsequent interpretation and application of GAARs in jurisdictions such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, the UK, China and India. However, a review of current literature reveals that different academics evaluate GAARs based on different sets of criteria. This results in an absence of a common theoretical framework with which to assess the effectiveness of existing and proposed GAARs. Further, it is arguably difficult to undertake a comparative analysis of GAARs as a lack of a common normative framework decreases the validity and robustness of a comparison of findings. The aim of the study discussed in this article is to develop a normative framework with which to assess GAARs by adopting a thematic analysis of relevant academic articles published since 2000. Thirty-eight academic articles were selected for this study with each article coded to ascertain common themes. This has allowed categories of quotations to be determined and a structured theoretical framework to be developed. The article concludes that the resulting framework highlights five principles relating to the structure and evaluation of GAARs: <b>purposive</b> and objective <b>interpretation,</b> a proactive stance, discretion, certainty, and ability to alter liability. Each of these principles is discussed and, in doing so, this article fills a gap in the current literature by developing a principled framework to help ensure that future studies evaluate GAARs from a single point of view. Finally, the article examines this principled framework in the context of ten GAARs in the Asia-Pacific region in order to see whether governments in that region adopt the factors which have been determined {{to be part of the}} framework for a model GAAR...|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that interpretation plays {{a significant role}} in tourism. It can help to enrich visitors’ experience and their cultural and environmental knowledge so that empathy towards conservation, heritage and culture can develop. However, there is a concern that much of the interpretation practised by the tourism industry is of poor quality. Its significance in ecotourism, cultural tourism, wildlife tourism, heritage and adventure tourism, and the concern about its quality gives rise to the need to examine how effective guides are in its delivery, what makes guides effective or ineffective and what continuing education and training they require for effective interpretive delivery. It is against this background that this study was done in order to investigate the interpretive effectiveness of tour guides in South African national parks. The overall {{purpose of the study was}} to design a model for effective interpretation for tour guides operating in South African national parks. To accomplish this, an in-depth literature review was done, followed by an empirical investigation. From the literature, the concept of environmental and cultural interpretation was analysed and the constructs that form the theoretical framework for measuring interpretation identified. A conceptual model was formulated that indicates that the effectiveness of tour guides is related to park policies; knowledge and appropriate application of interpretive delivery techniques; management support, evaluation and tourists’ feedback. A mixed method research design was employed, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative methods. In-depth interviews were conducted with nominated officials in the parks to solicit their views on what they perceive as critical issues in the delivery of effective interpretation. Tour guides were surveyed to determine their perceptions of problems with interpretive delivery techniques and their continuing education and training needs in regard to interpretive delivery techniques. Tourists were surveyed to determine their perceptions about their general satisfaction as attributed to interpretation, and the extent to which tour guides applied the interpretive delivery techniques during <b>interpretation.</b> <b>Purposive</b> sampling and convenience sampling techniques were used in this study. Data analysis on the qualitative interviews was done by summarising the content and categorising the statements made by the officials from certain which conclusions could be drawn. These interviews generated certain constructs and variables which were included in the survey instrument. Critical factors for effective interpretation, according to officials, were identified. These included communication skills, continuing education and training, knowledge of the area and a passion for the task. Quantitative data was analysed by ranking those factors which proved to be most problematic in effective interpretive delivery, the most important of which is addressing tourists by their names, using the five senses to enhance the experience, gaining the attention of the tourists, encouraging participation of tourists and presenting the content in a simple manner. Tour guides generally did not rate delivery techniques as being “serious” problems. It was taken into account that tour guides may be reluctant to state the level of a perceived problem in applying effective delivery techniques and to overcome this limitation, questions relating to the need for training in the same delivery techniques were included in the questionnaire. The results indicated a higher level of the need for training than the level of the perceived problem. Tourists were generally satisfied with the tour guides’ interpretation although only a few were not satisfied with the interpretation of tour guides. However, to ensure sustainability, there is a need for continuing education and training in interpretive delivery techniques and interpretive content for tour guides. This study makes a valuable contribution in regard to tourism, in both the academic and the professional (interpretive guiding) spheres. It provides clear guidelines for national parks to improve the quality of the visitor’s experience and should contribute to the achievement of the goals of sustainability. It provides information that will assist officials in the national parks and those who provide professional development training for guides to better understand guides’ need for further training skills in interpretation in South Africa, an issue which has not been adequately researched in this country. The study produced a model that could enhance interpretive delivery techniques of tour guides in South African national parks. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.
