In this paper we argue that applications {{should be given the}} opportunity to use as backing store either <b>magnetic</b> <b>disk</b> or the memory of idle workstations within the same LAN. We have implemented a pager that provides this flexibility, measured its performance over an Ethernet, and found it to be superior to traditional disk paging. We conclude that as the available network bandwidth increases, the use of network memory as backing store becomes a evenmore attractive alternative. 1 Introduction Traditional {{operating systems}} use <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks</b> as paging devices. In such systems, pages that can't be placed in main memory are stored on the <b>magnetic</b> <b>disk,</b> and recalled to main memory when needed. Because <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks</b> speed does not keep up with processor speed, the cost of paging (measured in processor cycles) increases with time. For [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{transactions}} {{have been}} a valuable abstraction of atomicity, persistency, and recoverability, {{they have not been}} widely used in programming environments today, mostly because of their high overheads that have been driven by the low performance of <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks.</b> A major challenge in transaction-based systems is to remove the <b>magnetic</b> <b>disk</b> from the critical path of transaction management.

Our system is based on a layer of reliable main memory that provides fast and recoverable storage of data. We have implemented our system as a user-level library on top of the Windows NT operating system in a network of workstations connected with the SCI interconnection network.

40|$|For {{applications}} {{with large}} data sets, e. g., video servers, <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks</b> have established {{themselves as the}} mass storage device of choice. A technique to increase the storage capacity of disks is zoning. A side-effect of zoning is that it introduces a disk drive with variable transfer rates. This chapter describes techniques to support a continuous display of constant-bit rate video and audio objects using a multi-zone disk drive. As compared to previous approaches, the proposed techniques harness the average transfer rate of each <b>magnetic</b> <b>disk</b> (instead of its minimum transfer rate). In addition, we describe a configuration planner that logically manipulates the zoning information of a disk drive to support the performance criteria of an application. We present performance numbers from an experimental prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. 1 INTRODUCTION A technological trend {{in the area of}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks</b> is an increase in their storage capacity (a 25 % increase a [...] ...|$|R

The presence of the arrays of magnetic dots leads to a quantized displacement of the normal/superconducting phase boundary along the magnetic field axis, with each step corresponding to a flux-quantum per unit cell of the magnetic lattice. We demonstrate that this so-called field-induced superconductivity is strongly dependent {{not only on the}} chosen magnetic material and its magnetization M but also on the radius R of the constructed <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks.</b> Since field-induced superconductivity is directly linked to the nucleation of vortex-antivortex (V-AV) pairs, a theoretical M-R equilibrium phase boundary is presented, delimiting regions of different numbers of induced V-AV pairs per magnet.

40|$|We will, in this thesis, closely {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} SSDs and <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks.</b> Looking at physical attributes of these two disk technolo- gies, {{we will try to}} give an understanding of how they perform in dif- ferent scenarios based on real workloads. Based on what we learn from investigating the performance in these scenarios, we will try to get an un- derstanding of what performance issues the different storage technologies faces. We will look at how optimizations in Operating System (OS) and at application-level have an impact on SSDs and <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks,</b> as well as {{what we can do to}} achieve best possible performance. In our benchmarks, we show that early generation SSD suffer from write amplification, and will, because of that, have problems achieving good performance on random write operations. By introducing a log-based file system, we see that we can remove the effect of write amplification received by random write operations, and give us a more stable perfor- mance. We discuss, and benchmark, possible alternatives for optimizing existing applications for <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks,</b> by introducing SSDs, as an alter- native to <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks</b> as storage device. By going from high-end mag- netic disks to SSDs, we see that we, in some cases, can achieve orders of magnitude better performance, without changing application level code...|$|R
40|$|Flash {{solid state}} drives (SSDs), or flash disks, are {{a type of}} {{persistent}} storage deviceswith the potential to replace <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks.</b> They outperform <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks</b> on access speed, bandwidth, shock resistance, and power efficiency. As their capacity increases and prices decrease, flash disks are considered for the storage of database systems. Due to the differences in flash SSDs and <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks,</b> traditional data management techniques designed for <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks</b> need to be re-examined for flash disks. In particular, the flash memory used in flash disks has an asymmetry between read and write speeds, where reads, no matter random or sequential, are much faster than writes. This thesis studies the performance of transactional workloads on flash disks and designs efficient storage schemes for them. Specifically, {{we begin with the}} performance study of the TPC-C workload on flash SSDs. Overall, the flash SSDs outperform the <b>magnetic</b> <b>disk</b> by up to an order of magnitude. Moreover, the I/O performance of the SSDs is dominated by random writes, whereas that of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>disk</b> by random reads. Additionally, both minimising logging and adopting MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) than 2 PL (Two-Phase Locking) helps improve the performance on flash SSDs. Observing the dominance of random writes in flash SSDs under TPC-C workloads, we propose a new database storage layout, called Partitioned Logging (PTL). In PTL, we replace data writes with logging to eliminate random page writes, and put data and logs into separate blocks. Moreover, we group data blocks into partitions so that updates on each partition are appended as log entries to one log block. This way, we can tune the partition size to balance the read and write performance based on the hardware and workload characteristics. The results show a considerable improvement over both the traditional storage and a leading flash-based database storage scheme. Finally, to solve the redundant I/O problem and eliminate merge operations that are essential in all the other log-structured approaches, we propose FlashTKV, which adopts a purely sequential storage format where all the data and transactional information are log records. Furthermore, we support MVCC on this sequential storage efficiently. Our results show that FlashTKV improves the transaction throughput by 70 % over two well-known KV-stores under TPC-C workloads on flash SSDs...|$|R
