40|$|Background: In IVF/ICSI treatment, several {{attempts}} have been made to quantify the implantation potential of embryos in order to optimize the pregnancy rate. The objective was to determine the possible factors which might have positive impact on implantation. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 110 IVF- ICSI cycles as first trial for ART programs. Maternal and ovulation factors such as female age, body mass index, type of infertility, infertility diagnosis, duration of ovulation stimulation, numbers of aspirated and fertilized oocytes, day of ET, were compared in high (≥ 2 gestational sacs) and low implantation groups (one or no sac). All analyses were adjusted for age and PCO subgroups in line with the design of the study. Results: Our results showed that there were significant differences in follicle size between high and low implantation groups (19. 32 ± 0. 37 vs. 18. 07 ± 0. 32 respectively) (p= 0. 014). Mean number of grade (V) oocytes was also statistically greater in high implantation group (p= 0. 035).

40|$|Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is a {{major cause}} of female infertility. Despite substantial effort, the etiology and pathogenesis of PCOS and polycystic ovaries (<b>PCO)</b> in <b>women</b> remain unknown. Recent studies in laboratory animals have documented a link between dysfunction of two oocyte growth factors, growth differentiation factor- 9 (GDF- 9) and bone morphogenetic factor- 15 (BMP- 15), and aberrant folliculogenesis. Because aberrant follicle development is a hallmark of PCOS, we wondered whether the expression patterns of these growth factors might be disrupted in PCOS and PCO oocytes. To address this issue, we compared the pattern and level of expression of GDF- 9 and BMP- 15 mRNA in ovaries from normal cycling (n = 12), PCOS (n = 5), and PCO (n = 7) patients. in situ hybridization studies showed that the expression of GDF- 9 and BMP- 15 is restricted to the oocytes in all ovaries examined. Interestingly, a decreased level of GDF- 9 signal was observed in developing PCOS and PCO oocytes, compared with normal. This difference was evident throughout folliculogenesis, beginning at recruitment initiation and continuing through the small Graafian follicle stage. By contrast, there were no qualitative or quantitative changes in the expression of BMP- 15 mRNA in PCOS oocytes during folliculogenesis. There were also no significant differences between normal and PCOS and PCOs in the levels of the mRNA encoding the housekeeping gene, cyclophilin. Together, these results indicate that the expression of GDF- 9 mRNA is delayed and reduced in PCOS and PCO oocytes during their growth and differentiation phase. Because oocyte-derived GDF- 9 is crucial for normal folliculogenesis and female fertility, we suggest that a dysregulation of oocyte GDF- 9 expression may contribute to aberrant folliculogenesis in PCOS and <b>PCO</b> <b>women.</b> Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Reprod Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USAUniversidade Federal de São Paulo, BR- 01311940 São Paulo, BrazilKyungpook Natl Univ, Taegu 700721, South KoreaSeoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Seoul 110744, South KoreaUniversidade Federal de São Paulo, BR- 01311940 São Paulo, BrazilWeb of Scienc...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The study aims {{to assess}} the effect of laparoscopic ovarian {{drilling}} (LOD) in clomiphene citrate resistant patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO) on the changes occurred in ovarian reserve. Study design: A prospective cohort study. Setting: Sohag University Hospital, Sohag, Egypt. Materials and methods: Thirty-seven patients with PCO {{were enrolled in the}} study. We evaluated the effect of LOD on the ovarian reserve using hormonal assay (measuring FSH, LH, AMH, Testosterone, SHBG, E 2 and FAI) and sonographic markers (including ovarian volume, antral follicle count (AFC) and ovarian stromal blood flow). Results: Amongst the 37 patients underwent LOD, regulation of the cycle occurred in 20 patients after 6  months (54. 06 %) (p =  0. 001). Occurrence of pregnancy occurred in 4 patients after three months and in 18 patients after 6  months. As regard the hormonal profile, LOD has reducing effect on the serum levels of FSH, LH, AMH, SHBG, Testosterone and free androgen index. This reduction is of statistically significance in case of LH, AMH, testosterone and FAI especially after 6  months (p =  0. 01, 0. 001, 0. 05, 0. 05 respectively). The deleterious effect of LOD was statistically significant in the AFC which was reduced from 18. 1  ±  2. 7 to 11. 5  ±  1. 8 after 6  months (p =  0. 05).

METHODS: The ultrasonographic ovarian morphology and the hormonal and metabolic profile of female cases with self-reported symptoms typical of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (n = 196) and asymptomatic controls (n = 67) at the age of 31 years were examined in a general population-based Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966. RESULTS: The prevalence of PCO (37. 3 versus 18. 2 %; P = 0. 004) was significantly higher in the cases (oligomenorrhoea and/or hirsutism) than in the controls. PCO morphology was detected in 18. 4 % of those who reported only hirsutism, in 47. 9 % of those reporting only oligomenorrhoea, and in 70. 4 % of those reporting both symptoms. In the cases with PCO compared to (i) the controls and (ii) the cases without PCO, body mass index (P = 0. 026 and P = 0. 011), ovarian volume [right P = 0. 001, left P = 0. 208 (non-significant) and right P < 0. 001, left P = 0. 022], mean follicle number (P < 0. 001 and P < 0. 001), testosterone (P = 0. 063 and P = 0. 029), free androgen index (P = 0. 007 and P = 0. 013) and insulin (P = 0. 033 and P = 0. 040) were higher, and sex hormone-binding globulin (P = 0. 039 and P = 0. 068) and glucose:insulin ratio (P = 0. 060 and P = 0. 054) lower. Cases with PCO also had higher waist:hip ratio (P = 0. 011), infertility rate (P = 0. 005) and glucose (P = 0. 045) and lower insulin-like growth factor-binding protein- 1 (P = 0. 012) than controls.

The mean CAG repeat number is similar between the cases (18. 74 ± 0. 13) and controls (18. 73 ± 0. 12). The obese <b>PCOS</b> <b>women</b> were significantly more frequent in the 20 CAG repeat category than the lean <b>PCOS</b> <b>women,</b> yielding a highly significant odds (p =  0. 001). Among the women with non-random X-inactivation, alleles with < 19 repeats were more frequently activated among cases than controls (p =  0. 33). CAG repeat polymorphism by itself cannot be considered as a useful marker for discriminating PCOS. We observed a trend of preferential activation of the shorter allele among the PCOS cases with non random XCI pattern. In the obese <b>PCOS</b> <b>women,</b> this microsatellite variation may account for the hyperandrogenicity to a larger extent than the lean <b>PCOS</b> <b>women...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Polycystic ovaries (PCO) {{and their}} {{clinical}} expression (the {{polycystic ovary syndrome}} [PCOS]) as well as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) are common medical conditions linked through insulin resistance. We studied the prevalence of PCO and PCOS in women with diet and/or oral hypoglycemic treated T 2 DM and non-diabetic control women. Design Prospective study. Methods One hundred and five reproductive age group women with diet and /or oral hypoglycemic treated T 2 DM were the subjects of the study. Sixty age-matched non-diabetic women served as controls. Transabdominal ultrasonographic assessment of the ovaries was used to diagnose PCO. Clinical, biochemical and hormonal parameters were also noted.

40|$|Introduction:Polycystic ovarian (pco) {{syndrome}} {{is one of}} the most prevalent (4 - 8 %) endocrine glands disorders among women 15 - 45 years old. In women with polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos), increased blood pressure and abnormal androgen are prevalent. In addition to the patients, their first degree relatives are exposed to some risk factors such as hypertension and hyperandrogenemia. Due to the high prevalence of <b>pcos</b> among <b>women</b> and its outcomes among their first degree relatives, it is necessary to recognize the high risk people. This study was conducted to survey hypertension and hyperandrogenemia in the first degree relatives of patients with polycystic ovarian syndromeMaterial and Methods:This is a case-control study in which 107 individuals as case group and 107 individuals as control group were selected from among the first degree relatives of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome in 2008. The participants filled in a questionnaire on demographics. Then their blood pressure was measured and blood samples were taken from all the participants in order to assay their serum androgens. After performing biochemical tests, data were gathered and analyzed by Chi square and Kapa tests with 95 % confidence intervals and alpha coefficients 0. 05. Results:The mean of the total androgens and high level blood pressure of the control group were much different from those of the case group (P< 0. 05). Conclusion:The first degree relatives of women suffering from polycystic ovarian syndrome are probably exposed to abnormal blood pressure and hyperandrogenemia...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Insulin {{resistance}} (IR) and ovarian and adrenal hyperandrogenism are {{a common}} finding in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The aim {{of the present study}} was to access possible differences in insulin resistance, gonadotropins, and androgens production in obese and nonobese <b>PCOS</b> <b>women.</b> Study Design. We studied 37 <b>PCOS</b> <b>women</b> (16 nonobese and 21 obese) and 18 nonobese controls. Fasting glucose, insulin, androgens, and gonadotropins levels were determined. Salivary cortisol was measured basal and in the morning after dexamethasone (DEX) 0. 25 [*]mg. Results. Nonobese <b>PCOS</b> <b>women</b> showed higher basal salivary cortisol and serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels than controls and obese PCOS.

40|$|Background: Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is {{the most}} common endocrine disorder. It is associated with high prevalence of metabolic risk factors, but {{little is known about the}} prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) and its components among Egyptian <b>PCOS</b> <b>women.</b> The objective of the study was to determine the metabolic abnormalities among young Egyptian women with PCOS and evaluate their relation with adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) variants and body fat adiposity pattern. Materials and methods: The present study included 80 <b>PCOS</b> <b>women</b> and 80 healthy women with similar age and body mass index. All participants underwent clinical, anthropometric, biochemical, ultrasonographic and adiponectin (ADIPOQ) gene 11391 G>A (rs 17300539) examinations. Insulin resistance was assessed by the Homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Results: MS was identified in 22. 5 % of <b>PCOS</b> <b>women.</b> The most prevalent MS components in <b>PCOS</b> <b>women</b> were central obesity, decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and increased triglycerides (TG), blood pressure (BP) and fasting glucose levels. The study found association between ADIPOQ promoter variants − 11391 G>A and MS in <b>PCOS</b> <b>women.</b> Moreover, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed association between abdominal fat accumulation and IR in PCOS. Conclusion: The prevalence of MS was significantly higher in <b>PCOS</b> <b>women</b> than controls, and central obesity and hypertension are risk factors for insulin resistance.

40|$|Polycystic ovarian {{syndrome}} (PCOS) {{is often}} accompanied by infertility that necessitates ovulation induction using clomiphene citrate, gonadotropins or even in vitro fertilization (IVF). These treatment methods are known to increase the incidence of multiple pregnancies {{as well as some}} negative consequences, including a rise in the risk for gestational diabetes mellitus, pre-eclampsia, etc., Furthermore, pregnancies established after IVF carry an increased risk for maternal complications. However, the increased risk of developing adverse obstetric complications has been suggested to occur independently of obesity as well as in populations without assisted reproductive techniques. Many studies have been performed to study the effect of PCOS on pregnancy and the effect of pregnancy on PCOS. The hormonal milieu that is exaggerated in <b>PCOS</b> <b>women</b> is quite well understood at the biochemical and genetic levels.

40|$|El síndrome de poliquistosis ovárica (PCOS) es un desorden endocrino-metabólico de naturaleza multifactorial, con una marcada predisposición genética, que afecta al 6 % de las mujeres en edad reproductiva. Se caracteriza por la presencia de hiperandrogenismo, oligo-anovulación y ovarios poliquísticos. Entre los genes candidatos se encuentran aquellos que codifican para enzimas que actúan en la síntesis de andrógenos. Dos de los genes candidatos son el CYP 17 y el CYP 11 alfa que codifican para la 17 alfa hidroxilasa (P 45017 alfa) y para el P 450 scc (colesterol {{side chain}} cleavage) respectivamente. Los polimorfismos en estos genes están asociados al desarrollo del fenotipo hiperandrogénico. Nuestro objetivo fue analizar las frecuencias alélicas de los polimorfismos de los dos genes mencionados en población con PCOS, compararla con población normal y analizar la relación de cada variante alélica con el fenotipo hiperandrogénico correspondiente. Se analizaron 65 pacientes y 58 controles sanos en los que se determinaron niveles de testosterona y frecuencia de polimorfismos en los genes mencionados. Se observó una diferencia estadísticamente significativa cuando se asoció el grupo de mayor nivel de androgenemia con la presencia del genotipo A 2 /A 2 del gen CYP 17, y se hallaron mayores niveles de andrógenos circulantes en las pacientes con PCOS portadoras del alelo 216 - del gen CYP 11 alfa. Nuestros resultados sugieren que ambos alelos juegan un rol menor en el desarrollo de PCOS y podrían ser considerados como potenciales marcadores de riesgo genético para el desarrollo del fenotipo hiperandrogénico. The polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is a heterogeneous multifactorial endocrine metabolic disorder with genetic predisposition affecting 6 % {{of women in the}} reproductive age. This syndrome is characterized by the presence of oligo-anovulation, hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries. Several genes have been postulated as responsible for the etiology of this disorder. Among these genes are those encoding the enzymes involved in the ovarian androgen biosynthesis. Two of the candidate genes are the CYP 17 and the CYP 11 alpha, encoding the 17 -alpha-hydroxylase (P 45017 alpha) and the cholesterol side chain cleavage (P 450 scc) respectively. The polymorphisms of these genes are linked to the development of an hyperandrogenic phenotype. The aim of this work was to analyze the allelic frequencies of such polymorphisms in a cohort of women with PCOS and to compare them with those of healthy women. Furthermore, the correlation between each allelic variant and the corresponding hyperandrogenic phenotype was also assessed. Therefore, 65 patients and 58 age matched healthy controls were analyzed. The serum levels of testosterone and the frequency of each polymorphism were determined. When the PCOS population was analyzed, a significant statistical difference was found when relating the group with the highest androgenemia level with the presence of A 2 /A 2 genotype of CYP 17 gene, and a higher level of circulating androgen was found in <b>PCO</b> <b>women</b> carrying the 216 - allele of CYP 11 alpha gene (that did not reach statistical significance). Our results suggest that both alleles play a minor {{role in the development of}} PCOS and could be a genetic risk marker of the hyperandrogenic phenotype...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} the relationship between endocrine, clinical and metabolic parameters in 35 women (mean age 27. 3 years) with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and 30 age- and body mass index-matched normal ovulatory women. In <b>PCOS</b> <b>women,</b> serum leptin, homocysteine, insulin, insulin-like growth factor- 1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein- 3 levels and the insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) were significantly higher, while sex hormone-binding globulin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were lower compared with healthy women.

A group of 118 <b>women</b> showing <b>PCO</b> on vaginal ultrasound scan was divided into those who had no hyperandrogenaemia (n = 21) and those who had increased androgens and a clinical presentation normally associated with PCOS (n = 97).

Apart from higher concentrations of androgens in the PCOS group, there were no significant differences between the PCO and PCOS groups in either fasting and stimulated insulin and glucose or in concentrations of sex hormone-binding globulin, gonadotrophins and blood lipids or in ovarian volume. Both PCO and PCOS subjects with cycle irregularity had significantly higher concentrations of serum fasting and stimulated insulin independent of androgens and body mass index than those with normal cycles. It was concluded that: (i) PCO and PCOS patients have equivalent disturbances in relation to insulin and glucose metabolism as well as lipid and lipoprotein disturbances compared to reference subjects; (ii) higher serum insulin values are associated with menstrual irregularity in both groups; (iii) ultrasound evidence for PCO predicts similar metabolic sequelae to PCOS and can therefore be used for studies of the genetics and long term risks for this condition...|$|R

Two- and three-dimensional ultrasound scans were performed to study ovarian morphology and ovarian stromal blood flow. Anthropometric, hormonal and biochemical profiles were compared between women with and without ultrasound features of PCO. The prevalence of <b>PCO</b> in Chinese <b>women</b> was 23 %. The group with a history of GDM had a higher but not statistically significant prevalence of PCO (34 %). Compared with controls, they had significantly higher incidence of obesity, impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes, fasting insulin and leptin levels, and their lipid profile was less favorable. Also, their level of sex hormone-binding globulin was significantly lower and hence their free androgen index was higher, and so was their level of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate.
