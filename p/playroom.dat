The students and their belongings would then move up to their next <b>playroom.</b>|$|E

5|$|St Mary's Hall, on an {{adjoining}} site to Stonyhurst, was {{built as a}} Jesuit seminary in 1828 (extended in the 1850s) and functioned until 1926, when the seminarians moved to Heythrop Hall. The poet Gerard Manley Hopkins, and John Tolkien, son of J. R. R. Tolkien, trained as priests there. During World War II, the English College left Benito Mussolini's Italy and occupied the hall. After their return to Rome, St Mary's Hall opened as a middle school in 1946.

25|$|Although the Ilmatar {{was built}} as a two-class ship, she had only one dining room that was used by both classes. Other {{facilities}} included a first-class smoking room, located one deck higher from the dining room. As built she had six passenger-accessible decks. The 1973 lengthening saw the addition of several new cabins, a children's <b>playroom</b> and a new waste processing plant. More cabins were added during a 1974 refit at the Valmet shipyard in Vuosaari. In the 1979 conversion into a cruise ship more luxurious cabins were added and a swimming pool was constructed on the rear deck.|$|E
25|$|The {{change of}} use of the holds meant that Andes four cranes (two forward, two aft) could be removed. The two cranes on her after deck were {{replaced}} with a single kingpost and derrick abaft the E Deck superstructure for loading stores. The superstructure of D Deck was extended both fore and aft to add new cabins, which {{became known as the}} Dutch Cabins. Existing cabins were upgraded so that all now had either a shower or a bathroom en suite. A new children's <b>playroom</b> was added. The after extension allowed the lido area above to be enlarged and given greater facilities, including a cocktail lounge. Air conditioning was extended to all cabins and almost all public accommodation.|$|E

25|$|The {{quality of}} the First Class was also improved. Children began to appear {{as part of the}} {{clientele}} needed to be satisfied, and thus a <b>playroom</b> for them was built on the boat deck. Similar to her two sister ships, the first class amenities included the Grand Staircase, but the Britannic's amenities were more sumptuous, with worked balustrades, decorative panels and a pipe organ. The A Deck of the ship was devoted in its entirety to the First Class, being fitted with a salon, two veranda cafes, a smoking room and a reading room. The B Deck included a hair salon. The most important addition was that of individual bathrooms in almost every First Class cabin, which would have been a first on an ocean liner (on the Olympic and the Titanic, most passengers had to use public bathrooms).|$|E
25|$|The {{forecastle}} {{machinery and}} the two cargo cranes in the forward well deck are well preserved. The foremast is bent and lies on the sea floor near the wreck with the crow's nest still attached on it. The bell was not found. Funnel #1 was found a few metres from the Boat Deck. The other three funnels {{were found in the}} debris field (located off the stern). Pieces of coal lie beside the wreck. The wreck of Britannic is in excellent condition, and the only signs of deterioration are the children's <b>playroom</b> and some of the captain's quarters, {{but the rest of the}} ship is in outstanding shape. The wreck lies in shallow enough water that scuba divers trained in technical diving can explore it, but it is listed as a British war grave and any expedition must be approved by both the British and Greek governments.|$|E
