5000|$|On 18 February 1872, a Lancashire & Yorkshire {{freight train}} {{travelling}} eastwards had {{stopped in the}} evening at Stanningley railway station to pick up goods. This necessitated the engine uncoupling from its train at {{the east end of}} the station and reversing across the down line and into the goods sidings which were adjacent to the Bradford bound platform (so that it could <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>wagons).</b> The engine was being driven by the fireman and neither he nor the driver had obtained permission to cross. The train was hit by a L&Y express from Leeds to Manchester travelling at about 30 mph. Fault was found by the accident investigation on the driver and fireman of the stopping goods service, the shunter who had set the crossover points and also the signalman who had not followed proper procedures in signalling the goods train. The driver, fireman, guard and two people in the passenger train were hurt.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} double track {{comprising}} the C siding (essentially main lain and loop) provided {{only the most}} basic of facilities, and operating flexibility was limited. If ever a main line train failed to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> loaded <b>wagons</b> (a booked operation), or if the High Peak shunter was slow to remove empties, the result was considerable congestion.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} has two-station controls. For {{operation in}} the diesel-only mode it was powered by a [...] Caterpillar type DITA 3508 prime mover. Its diesel-only ability allows it to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> and shunt <b>wagons</b> from unelectrified industrial sidings.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} opened in 1884. In {{order to provide}} a better link from the {{terminus}} at St. Andreasberg West to {{the centre of the}} town, from 1913 to 1959 a rack railway, the St. Andreasberg rack railway, was operated as a Kleinbahn between St. Andreasberg West to St. Andreasberg Stadt (town). It owned two cogwheel steam locomotives and two mountain railway passenger coaches, and <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> goods <b>wagons</b> at Silberhütte destined for the town station. A project by Prussian chief mechanical engineer, Georg Fichtner, from Berlin, to extend the railway line to Bad Harzburg was not realised.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the start}} of World War I, the 77 mm had become the {{standard}} German weapon, and came mounted on a large traverse that could be easily <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> on a <b>wagon</b> for movement. Krupp 75 mm guns were supplied with an optical sighting system that improved their capabilities. The German Army also adapted a revolving cannon {{that came to be}} known to Allied fliers as the [...] "flaming onion" [...] from the shells in flight. This gun had five barrels that quickly launched a series of 37 mm artillery shells.|$|R
5000|$|... "The large W.D. Department depot here {{brings a}} good deal of traffic to this section, and after a lengthy halt outside the yard {{instructions}} were given to run through and reverse into the sidings. Three small W.D. tank engines were in evidence... Once the local freight was clear of the line, a heavy W.D. special backed slowly out of the depot yards and on to the running line. This train consisted of 35 wagons, and was... soon on its way westward to Stratford and beyond... The line was now clear for shunting, but such is the layout here that it was quite a complicated business to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> eight <b>wagons</b> and detach one. However, the job was completed eventually, and the train remarshalled, though a further wait was necessary until the 1.15 p.m. from Stratford arrived. This train of 21 wagons... reached Burton Dassett considerably behind schedule, and after one hour spent in the sidings here train left on the last stage of its journey at 2.30 p.m." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1957 Parliament {{authorised}} Liverpool Corporation {{to flood}} {{a section of}} the line by damming the Afon Tryweryn. Monies were made available to divert the route round the dam, but it was decided that improving the road from Bala to Llan Ffestiniog would be of greater benefit. Road transport alternatives were established for groups such as schoolchildren and workers. The plans afoot for rail serving Trawsfynydd nuclear power station were to be catered for by building the long-discussed cross-town link between the two Blaenau standard gauge stations. The estimated financial savings to be made were £23,300 by withdrawing the passenger service and £7000 in renewal charges. [...] The line and station closed to passengers in January 1960 and to freight a year later, with the last train <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> one coal <b>wagon</b> at Manod and leaving another, whose fate is unrecorded. In 1964 the cross-Blaenau link was completed, enabling the line to reopen from Blaenau southwards through the station site to a siding near the site of [...] where a large ("Goliath") gantry was erected to load and unload traffic for the then new Trawsfynydd nuclear power station. The main goods transported were nuclear fuel rods carried in nuclear flasks to and from Calder Hall in Cumbria (later known as Sellafield). The line was also used during the late 1980s for freight traffic to a siding at [...] serving the explosives factory in Penrhyndeudraeth.|$|R
5000|$|Wyatt made {{arrangements}} to escort Virgil and Allie {{to the train}} in Contention. On Monday, March 20, Wyatt received information that Ike Clanton, Frank Stilwell, Hank Swilling, and another Cowboy were watching the passenger trains in Tucson with the aim to kill Virgil. He thought getting the still invalid Virgil through to Tucson safely would require extra help. Wyatt, accompanied by Warren Earp, Doc Holliday, [...] "Turkey Creek" [...] Jack Johnson, and Sherman McMaster, guarded Virgil and Allie. They were all heavily armed with shotguns or rifles, except Virgil who had a pistol. The men accompanied Virgil and Allie to nearby Contention City, where they stabled their horses and <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> an extra <b>wagon.</b> They rode in the wagon to the rail head in Benson, where they caught the next train to Tucson. In Tucson, Virgil and Allie would connect with a train for California. Nathan W. Waite of Ash Canyon in the Huachuca Mountains was on the train with the Earp party. He said the Earp men were all armed and McMasters was wearing two cartridge belts. On their arrival in Tucson, they were greeted {{at the train station}} by Deputy U.S. Marshal J. W. Evans. Virgil and other witnesses later reported that they saw Stilwell, Ike Clanton, and other Cowboys at the train station, but when they saw how well guarded Virgil was, withdrew from the station platform. Witness J. W. Evans saw Holliday deposit two shotguns at the railroad station office.|$|R

Branch and Bound is method for searching systematic solution, in this case the solution would be organize to tree. Tree from at Branch and Bound algorithm build with scheme searching widely (BFS).
