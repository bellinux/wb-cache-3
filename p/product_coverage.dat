The petitions resulted in 93 preliminary countervailing duty and antidumping investigations involving 9 steel product lines from 9 countries.

40|$|The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) {{and members}} of the World TradeOrganization (WTO) have {{recently}} launched initiatives for reducing trade barriers onenvironmental goods. The initiatives are claimed by their participants to contribute positively to sustainable development (European Commission 2014, APEC 2012). The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate this claim by looking closer at the design of the two initiatives. First, the study defines ten criteria for how an environmental goods trade initiative could be designed to best contribute to sustainable development. Then, it evaluates whether the APEC and WTO initiatives are in compliance with the identified criteria. The data necessary to define the criteria was collected through semi-structured interviews with experts from the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development (ICTSD), the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD). The results of the analysis show that the initiatives have great room for improvementwhen it comes to both structure and <b>product</b> <b>coverage.</b> Substantial sustainable development gains can for instance be made by deepening the liberalization to include non-tariff barriers,including provisions that enhance technology transfer, and by broadening the <b>product</b> <b>coverage,</b> particularly by including more products in the sustainable energy category. Despite of their shortcomings, the initiatives should be welcomed as positive first steps to achieve free trade in environmental goods. </p...|$|E
40|$|Developing {{countries}} {{have an important}} stake in products which have relatively high post-Tokyo MFN tariff rates in developed market economy countries (DMECs). On the whole, their market share is greater in higher tariff imports and, consequently, reductions which cut high tariffs more than lower ones, e. g. by applying tariff ceilings or harmonization formulae, are {{in the interest of}} developing countries. They would benefit from such MFN reductions despite erosions in their existing preference margins. This is due to relatively narrower <b>product</b> <b>coverage</b> of GSP schemes and smaller preference margins in higher tariff imports - other than the schemes for the least developed countries. Therefore, complementing MFN reductions with broadening the <b>product</b> <b>coverage</b> of GSP schemes in high tariff items and deepening the preference margins in certain markets would significantly enhance the exports of developing countries. Tariff liberalization and improved GSP <b>product</b> <b>coverage</b> and margins in higher tariff items would do very little to developing countries, however, if NTMs were not relaxed to accommodate the potential gains from tariffs. The frequency and trade coverage of NTMs in DMECs affecting high tariff items are significantly greater compared to their overall imports. Furthermore, NTMs substantially discriminate imports from developing countries in high tariff products. Therefore, tariff liberalization schemes which are confined to products not currently covered by NTMs would not yield any noteworthy results for developing countries. This is to say that unless some action is taken in the field of NTMs, no significant expansion of trade can be expected through tariff reductions, not even in the high tariff items. Furthermore, if the relaxation of NTMs is only limited to the accommodation of potential trade expansion through tariff liberalization, even complete elimination of tariffs would only yield meager results. This overall picture is especially bleak for certain sectors, notably labour intensive manufactures such as textiles and clothing and miscellaneous manufactures. In some sectors, particularly in food products, the observations are diluted due to the extreme restrictiveness of some DMECs' trade regimes. Hence, the conclusion to draw is that the importance of liberalization of high tariff products for developing countries can be grossly understated as these evaluations are based on trade which is significantly curtailed by NTMs.  Published in connection with a visit at the IIES...|$|E
40|$|The Harmonized System is {{normally}} amended by the World Customs Organization every {{four to six}} years. These amendments pose considerable challenges for the WTO and its Members. On the one hand, Members need to periodically update their historical schedules of concessions into the latest nomenclature. On the other hand, these amendments may have implications for the definition and thus also the implementation of some WTO agreements where the <b>product</b> <b>coverage</b> is {{defined in terms of}} the HS. In either case, the product codes and/or descriptions in the old HS version need to be transposed precisely into those in the new version of HS nomenclature in order to retain the historical concessions or the <b>product</b> <b>coverage</b> unchanged. Given the complexity of HS amendments, this process could be very technical and sometimes tricky. This paper starts by providing an overview of the HS amendments and proposing a categorization of those HS changes in the context of transposition. It then looks back at the history of the introduction of the HS and its subsequent amendments into the WTO schedules and assesses the difficulties and problems which have been faced by WTO Members. On the basis of such analysis, it introduces the successful procedures and methodologies used by WTO Members and the WTO Secretariat to deal with the recent HS 2002 transposition. The paper also discusses the implications of the HS amendments to three WTO agreements and the possible approaches to transpose their product lists into a new HS nomenclature...|$|E
