5000|$|The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in a June 2016 {{report on}} payday lending, found that loan volume {{decreased}} 13% in Texas after the January 2012 disclosure reforms. The reform required lenders to disclose [...] "information {{on how the}} cost of the loan is impacted by whether (and how many times) it is renewed, typical <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>repayment,</b> and alternative forms of consumer credit that a consumer may want to consider, among other information". [...] The report cites that the decrease is due to borrowers taking fewer loans rather than borrowing smaller amounts each time. Re-borrowing rates slightly declined by 2.1% in Texas after the disclosure law took effect. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed rulemaking in June 2016, which would require payday lenders to verify the financial situation of their customers, provide borrowers with disclosure statements prior to each transaction, and limit the number of debt rollovers allowed, decreasing the industry by 55 percent. Another option would allow the lender to skip the ability to repay assessment for loans of $500 or less, but the lender would have to provide a realistic repayment schedule and limit the number of loans lent {{over the course of a}} year.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> early <b>repayment</b> in multi-period credit transactions. Considered {{one of the}} most common ways of conversion of unpaid interest for early repayment, so-called 78 rule. The relationship of this rule with the linear approximation of the exact value; redeemable debt is determined. The analysis of the maximum excess payment of interest on 78 rule. It has been shown how interest payment on 78 rule depended on the time <b>of</b> early <b>repayment.</b> Early <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> debt is an agreement under which the borrower pays to the lender amount of money equal to the current balance (as of loan account). Then further regular payments cease and the contract terminates. However, the amount of outstanding debt is determined by the structure of prescription charges. So in the uniform schemes <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> consumer credit each payment contains the same part of principal amounts and the total interest. In case <b>of</b> early <b>repayment</b> the Bank loses a significant fraction of the expected interest payments. Therefore, in practice, often used so-called accelerated schemes of interest payments. One of them is 78 rule. Use the 78 rule is simple and straightforward. The name of the rule is due to the fact that the sum of the numbers 12 monthly payments is 78. In the schemes of consumer loan with a term of one year interest payment for the current month is equal to m/ 78 of the total amount of interest payments, where m is the number of remaining payments. The rule name is stored and in the more general case with an arbitrary number of payments. In general interest payment is determined by the relative weight of the total amount of interest in each payment. In uniform schemes it is constant. In accelerated with a particular speed decreases. Therefore, additional cash expenses by the 78 rule may be considered as additional penalties for early <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> the debt. It this article is shown how this penalty depends on time before maturity. It is shown that the magnitude of these penalties in monetary terms reaches the maximum value when the loan is repaid early between half and two thirds of the total of the loan term...|$|R
40|$|Microfinance {{contracts}} {{have proven}} {{able to secure}} high rates <b>of</b> loan <b>repayment</b> {{in the face of}} limited liability and information asymmetries, but high repayment rates have not translated easily into profits for most microbanks. Profitability, though, {{is at the heart of}} the promise that microfinance can deliver poverty reduction while not relying on ongoing subsidy. The authors examine why this promise remains unmet for most institutions. Using a data set with unusually high quality financial information on 124 institutions in 49 countries, they explore the <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> profitability, loan <b>repayment,</b> and cost reduction. The authors find that institutional design and orientation matter substantially. Lenders that do not use group-based methods to overcome incentive problems experience weaker portfolio quality and lower profit rates when interest rates are raised substantially. For these individual-based lenders, one key to achieving profitability is investing more heavily in staff costs-a finding consistent with the economics of information but contrary to the conventional wisdom that profitability is largely a function of minimizing cost.

40|$|Economic factors {{associated}} with {{success or failure of}} dry-mill ethanol plants utilizing corn as a feedstock are analyzed and discussed. A spreadsheet model is used to conduct the analysis based on the assumptions and interactions of various factors. Plant managers and bankers were interviewed in the process of establishing baseline conditions of operation including capital cost per gallon of capacity, ethanol yield per bushel of corn ground, percentage of debt capital, operating expenses of natural gas, electricity, enzymes, chemicals, repairs, labor, and management. Sensitivities were determined and graphed to demonstrate the respective influence of corn price, ethanol price, natural gas price, ethanol yield, capacity factor, and interest rate-debt percent interactions. The model was used to predict the financial performance of a modern, well-sized, dry-mill plants if the prices that occurred over the past decade with respect to corn prices, ethanol prices, prices of DDGS and CO 2, natural gas prices, and interest rates were to re-play. Rates of returns on equity of dry-mill ethanol plants were compared to rates compiled in the last decade for a group of 200 farmers in southwestern Minnesota. <b>Patterns</b> <b>of</b> loan <b>repayment,</b> influence <b>of</b> technological changes, and the role of government subsidies are discussed.

Over course of time most of these farmers have fallen heavily into arrears with <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> their loans and this problem provides the focus for this study of problems of farmers on the settlement schemes, which has the ultimate objective of making recommendations for improving the present poor rate <b>of</b> <b>repayment.</b> Not unexpectedly overall income was found to be the crucial factor affecting rates <b>of</b> <b>repayment,</b> however the relationship of size of income to rate <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> is not straightforward as other factors intervene, especially <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> expenditure, and more importantly perhaps to any solution are those which indirectly affect rates <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> through their influence on income levels. It was furthermore discovered that some loan instalments are never credited due to poor administration and that the quality of administration permeates many other variables.
