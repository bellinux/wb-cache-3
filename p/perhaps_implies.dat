I was spared the deep anxieties of a married man, and I {{knew there were}} few of my intimate friends but would find my death troublesome chiefly on account of their duty of regret. I was surprised indeed, and perhaps a little humiliated, as I turned the matter over, to think how few could possibly exceed the conventional requirement. Things came before me stripped of glamour, in a clear dry light, during that walk from Haddon's house over Primrose Hill. There were the friends of my youth: I perceived now that our affection was a tradition, which we foregathered rather laboriously to maintain. There were the rivals and helpers of my later career: I suppose I had been cold-blooded or undemonstrative--one <b>perhaps</b> <b>implies</b> the other. It may be that even the capacity for friendship {{is a question of}} physique. There had been a time in my own life when I had grieved bitterly enough at the loss of a friend; but as I walked home that afternoon the emotional side of my imagination was dormant. I could not pity myself, nor feel sorry for my friends, nor conceive of them as grieving for me.|$|E

A vision recorded in [...] "Monumenta Moguntina", No. 112, <b>perhaps</b> <b>implies</b> that he {{was considered to be}} lacking in energy; nonetheless it would follow from William of Malmesbury's reference (Gest. Pont., I, 357) to a certain stream in which Daniel used to stand the whole night long to cool his passions, that {{he was a man of}} remarkable austerity.|$|E
5000|$|In the Middle Ages Neilston's {{position}} in the Barrhead Gap, a pass linking Ayrshire to Glasgow, gave it strategic importance. Robert Croc {{may have had a}} fort or watchtower at Coldoun in Neilston in the 12th century. [...] "Doun" [...] is a corruption of [...] "dun" [...] meaning castle or fort, and the prefix <b>perhaps</b> <b>implies</b> the lack of physical warmth within the tower or the greeting received by unwelcome guests.

Therein, Kipling identifies Balkis, [...] "Queen that was of Sheba and Sable and the Rivers of the Gold of the South" [...] as best, and perhaps only, beloved of the 1000 wives of Suleiman-bin-Daoud, King Solomon. Explicitly ascribed great wisdom, [...] "Balkis, almost as wise as the Most Wise Suleiman-bin-Daoud", nevertheless Kipling <b>perhaps</b> <b>implies</b> in her a greater wisdom than her husband, in that {{she is able to}} gently manipulate her husband, the afrits and djinns he commands, the other quarrelsome 999 wives of Suleimin-bin-Daoud, the butterfly of the title and the butterfly's wife, thus bringing harmony and happiness for all.|$|E

However, it seems that Kramer's translation is more appropriate concerning the Sumerian realm in which each and every creation must have had its clearly described purpose". Karen Rhea Nemet-Nejat noted the use of measuring rods in the tale as being linked to the history of writing, which developed in order to keep count of animals and produce. Jeremy Black suggests that the victory of grain <b>perhaps</b> <b>implies</b> that man can live without domestic animals, but cannot survive without bread. He goes on {{to point out that the}} debates on both sides are roughly equal.|$|E
5000|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{prominent}} way in which Sidney's Psalm 3 differs from the original text is its representation of God. As KJV is more closely connected to the original text from which it is translated, it presents God as a smiting and condemning figure, more {{in keeping with the}} God of the Old Testament. Sidney's Psalms represent a more all-loving and benevolent God, a figure that is more attributed to the New Testament, showing a clear juxtaposition between early readings of the bible and the sixteenth century interpretations. By the time Sidney began the project, the God of the Old Testament was no longer the God that Christians identified with. The figure of Jesus Christ as the son of God and his teachings of tolerance and forgiveness had caused God to evolve from being an icon of aggressive punishment to a far more fatherly figure. In Sidney's Psalm 3, David addresses God as his father: [...] "Help me, my God and Father!" [...] whereas God is never addressed this way in the KJV. In the KJV Psalm, instead of pleading God to [...] "help" [...] him, David instead asks God to [...] "save" [...] him. This <b>perhaps</b> <b>implies</b> that David fears the wrath of God and feels as though his soul requires saving, whereas Sidney's use of the word [...] "help" [...] connotes a far softer image and reinforces the more supportive and loving bond that he has with God. In the KJV, David thanks God for smiting his enemies. The use of violent imagery highlights the complete contrast between these two very different representations of the Christian God.|$|E

In an exciting new application, the authors measured the varying signatures of strontium, oxygen and carbon isotopes {{in the teeth of}} a sequence of people buried in Thailand during the period of the introduction and intensification of agriculture. Preliminary results point to the arrival of immigrant men, followed by a change in the relationship between the sexes: the women grow up on local food, the men have access to more widespread resources. This <b>perhaps</b> <b>implies</b> a matrilocal system, where forager men raised elsewhere marry into farming communities. It provides a likely antithesis to the social consequences of introducing agriculture into central Europe...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture {{by means of}} the horizon wave-function (HWF) formalism. We consider a charged massive particle whose quantum mechanical state is represented by a spherically symmetric Gaussian wave-function, and restrict our attention to the superextremal case (with charge-to-mass ratio α> 1), which is the prototype of a naked singularity in the classical theory. We find that one can still obtain a normalisable HWF for α 2 2, and the uncertainty in the location of the horizon blows up at α 2 = 2, signalling that such an object is no more well-defined. This <b>perhaps</b> <b>implies</b> that a quantum Cosmic Censorship might be conjectured by stating that no black holes with charge-to-mass ratio greater than a critical value (of the order of 2) can exist...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of burst oscillation at 1122 Hz in the X-ray transient XTE J 1739 - 285 supports {{the suggestion that}} it contains a submillisecond pulsar. In our estimations of the enormous dissipation effect in the transition boundary layer between quark matter core and hadron matter envelope, combing the viscosities of bulk mater in previous works, we show that XTE J 1739 - 285 can be uniquely restricted to a quark star masquerading as a neutron star (hybrid star) that contains a pure quark matter or mixed quark-hadron matter core from minimizing gravitational wave radiation (r-mode) instability and Keplerian motion constraints at 1122 Hz level through a three-parameters image. Such constraints allow the stellar radii in the range 9 km≤ R≤ 12 km and the stellar masses in the range 1. 2 M_≤ M≤ 2. 0 M_. It <b>perhaps</b> <b>implies</b> that submillisecond pulsars are just probes of quark matter. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
30|$|Beyond the {{theoretical}} implications, {{the results also}} offer guidelines for policy makers in identifying and implementing policy and communication strategies which will foster better environmentally-friendly lifestyles and society. First, pro-environmental behaviors are not independent. Policy and communication strategies which focus on a specific pro-environmental behavior can be effective to persuade people to adopt more pro-environmental activities, thus generating positive spillovers. This <b>perhaps</b> <b>implies</b> that letting people do something, instead of introducing what activity they should do, must be a critical cornerstone for behavioral changes towards environmentally responsible manners. Next, the practical significance of promoting internalized motivation has clearly been observed. Consumers who held strong self-determined motivations toward the environment seemed to spread positive change, in that they were then more likely to perform responsibly, and in turn tended to enhance their intentions to keep on behaving and shopping in environmentally-responsible ways. Public policy and communications should be designed in ways that people drive and strengthen their internal motivation and attitude toward socially responsible living. Doing so will facilitate the transformation of internal motivation and attitude into actual behaviors.|$|E

40|$|The {{amino acid}} {{sequence}} of the winged bean acidic lectin (WBA II) was determined by chemical means and by recombinant techniques. From the N- and C-terminal sequence, obtained chemically, primers were designed for PCR amplification of the genomic DNA. The PCR product was cloned and sequenced to get the complete primary structure of WBA II. Peptide fragments for sequencing were also obtained by tryptic cleavages of the native lectin. The WBA II sequence showed {{a high degree of}} homology with that of WBA I and Erythrina corallodendron lectin (ECorL), especially in the regions involved in subunit association, where there is a very high conservation of residues. This <b>perhaps</b> <b>implies</b> the importance of this particular region in subunit interactions in this lectin. In addition, many of the residues, involved in carbohydrate binding in legume lectins, appear to be conserved in WBA II. The distinct differences in anomeric specificity observed amongst WBA I, WBA II, ECorL and peanut agglutinin (PNA) may be explained by subtle differences in sequence/structure of their D-loops. WBA II binds adenine quite strongly; a putative adenine binding sequence has been identified...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the expression}} of the Neuronal Calcium Sensor Protein, VILIP- 1, in different normal human tissues and in tumour tissues. To represent epithelial tumours, we have chosen the squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus (E. S. C. C.). The oesophagus squamous cell carcinoma {{is one of the most}} aggressive tumours of the gastrointestinal tract. Despite many measures to improve its treatment, the prognosis remains poor at a 5 -year survival rate of 10 - 30 %. The methods we employed were immunohistochemical staining using the Avidin-Biotinyl-Peroxidase-Complex method, and immunofluorescence staining using antibodies against VILIP- 1 and the proliferation marker Ki- 67. There is a significant correlation regarding the increase of VILIP- 1 -negative tissue among the neoplastic tissue in comparison with the normal oesophageal tissue. In addition there is a significant increase of VILIP- 1 -negative tumours with the increasing tumour size (T 1 to T 4) and with the appearance of lymphatic metastasis (N 0 to N 1). There is no significant correlation between the VILIP- 1 expression and the differentiation (G) of the tumour. Although there is a decrease of VILIP- 1 expression and an increase of Ki- 67 expression in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, the comparison of VILIP- 1 expression and the proliferative activity by the Ki- 67 marked cells does not reach a significant level. Considered altogether these results support the putative tumour-suppressive function of VILIP- 1 in the oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, we stained some other human normal tissue and tumour tissue by immunohistochemical microarray analysis. Here the regulation of VILIP- 1 varied in particular tumour types. This <b>perhaps</b> <b>implies</b> that VILIP- 1 has just in some tumours a tumour-suppressive function...|$|E
