The agreement contemplated the supply and distribution of Emerson originated <b>product</b> <b>categories</b> through SHEAC's 200 retail stores and maintenance service centers {{as well as its}} extensive BtoB and BtoC e-commerce network.

25|$|Patent {{medicines}} {{were one}} of the first major <b>product</b> <b>categories</b> that the advertising industry promoted; patent medicine promoters pioneered many advertising and sales techniques that were later used for other products. Patent medicine advertising often marketed products as being medical panaceas (or at least a treatment for a large number of diseases) and emphasized exotic ingredients and endorsements from purported experts or celebrities, which may or may have not been true. Patent medicines were increasingly constricted in the United States in the early 20th century as the Food and Drug Administration and Federal Trade Commission added ever-increasing regulations to prevent fraud, unintentional poisoning and deceptive advertising. Sellers of liniments, claimed to contain snake oil and falsely promoted as a cure-all, made the snake oil salesman a lasting symbol for a charlatan.|$|E
40|$|The {{internal}} {{reference price}} is the decisive standard against which observed prices are compared {{to evaluate whether}} a product offering {{is a good deal}} or not. If no reference price has been established for a <b>product</b> <b>category,</b> such as for product innovations, is it uncertain against which standard the price can be compared. Despite extensive research on the use of reference prices, little is known how an internal reference price is constructed for an unfamiliar <b>product</b> <b>category.</b> We conduct two experiments to support our two suggested mechanisms. Reference prices for an unfamiliar <b>product</b> <b>category</b> can either be constructed through repeated exposure to incidental price information or through transfer of price information from a familiar, similar <b>product</b> <b>category</b> to an unfamiliar <b>product</b> <b>category,</b> but only if the product value and price are correlated; a condition often not considered in product innovation testing...|$|R

500|$|The {{popularity}} of such marketing approach and its effectiveness is hotly debated. Supporters claim that environmental appeals are actually growing in number–the Energy Star label, for example, now appears on 11,000 different companies' models in 38 <b>product</b> <b>categories,</b> from washing machines and light bulbs to skyscrapers and homes. However, despite {{the growth in}} the number of green products, green marketing is on the decline as the primary sales pitch for products. Shel Horowitz, a green marketer for over 30 years and primary author of Guerrilla marketing Goes Green [...] states that to market effectively, green businesses need to market to three different audiences, [...] "deep green," [...] "lazy green," [...] and [...] "nongreen", and that each must be approached differently. Each will have different trigger points that will move them to buy, and for the nongreen audience, marketing effectively usually requires emphasizing product superiority rather than care for the planet.|$|E

2500|$|Research {{shows that}} consumers' broad general {{perceptions}} of a country, including of its national characteristics, economic and political background, history, traditions, and representative products, combine to create an overall image or stereotype that is then attached to the products of that country. For example, a global survey carried out by Nielsen, reported that [...] Country of origin image has a significant influence on consumer perceptions and behaviours, and in situations in which additional information is unavailable or difficult to get can be the sole determinant {{of whether or not}} someone buys a product. Its effect is strongest on consumers who don't know much about the product or product type, and weakest on consumers who are well-informed. Sensitivity to country of origin varies by product category. It is strongest for durable goods and luxury goods and weakest for [...] "low involvement" [...] <b>product</b> <b>categories</b> such as shampoo and candy. In various studies it has also been proven that the Country-of-Origin Effect also applies to services.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} product {{markets in}} which consumers are {{interested only in}} a specific <b>product</b> <b>category</b> and initially do not know which <b>product</b> <b>category</b> matches their tastes. Using sophisticated tracking technologies, an intermediary can make inferences about a consumer’s preferred <b>product</b> <b>category</b> and offer advertising firms the possibility to target their ads to match the consumer’s taste. Such targeting reduces overall advertising costs and, as a direct effect, increases industry profits. However, as we show in this paper, when consumers form reference prices and are loss averse, more precise targeting may intensify competition between firms. As a result, firms may earn higher profits from “de-targeted” advertising; i. e., when the intermediary deliberately informs about some products and their price quotes from outside a consumer’s preferred <b>product</b> <b>category...</b>|$|R

40|$|Our {{objective}} {{in this research}} is to relate variability in <b>product</b> <b>category</b> sales to promotional activity in the <b>product</b> <b>category,</b> and other category specific characteristics.

We analyze data on about 2, 000 brands from 25 different SAMI categories, obtained with the cooperation of a major grocery chain. Our data suggest that an increase in the magnitude of discounts increases the variability in category sales but an increase in the frequency of discounts has an opposite effect. Furthermore, categories which are bulky, or categories where the degree of competitiveness is high, exhibit lower variability in sales. price discounts, <b>product</b> <b>category</b> sales, retailing, sales promotions...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is on the positive feedback effects of brand extensions. In particular, this study identifies and examines conditions under which brand extendibility is enhanced by expanding <b>product</b> <b>category</b> associations. This is important as {{it has been argued that}} the range of a brand’s extendibility is one measure of brand equity. Thus, developing strategies to modify brand <b>product</b> <b>category</b> associations that stretch brand extension boundaries may increase equity. The results indicate that systematically introducing brand extensions consistent with a broader, more superordinate <b>product</b> <b>category</b> can modify a brand’s <b>product</b> <b>category</b> associations and enhance its ability to accommodate more diverse extensions. More specifically, expansion of a brand’s <b>product</b> <b>category</b> associations and extension boundaries occur when: 1) extensions are perceived to be consistent with the parent brand image and 2) extensions and the current products together become associated with a more abstract, superordinate level <b>product</b> <b>category.</b> Further, under these conditions there is no evidence of adverse affects on either brand attitudes or brand image beliefs. To the contrary, when extensions were perceived to be inconsistent with the brand image or consumers perceived no sensible relationship between current brand products and extensions the brand is adversely affected. Finally, the results demonstrate that using traditional measures of perceived similarity (relatedness) between brand extensions and current parent brand products has important limitations and implications for identifying potential brand extensions.
