40|$|According to the European Services Directive, all {{member states}} have to support a genuine market in {{services}} by simplifying the communication between competent authorities and businesses by 2010. A so called <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Single</b> <b>Contact</b> (PSC) is supposed {{to assist in the}} complete life cycle of a business.

The directive is an interesting move to push the member states towards a more cooperative and process-oriented electronic government. However, along with this directive, the governmental institutions at all levels - from local authorities to federal governments - have to cooperate, at least to interact with each other. Therefore one of the major preconditions to meet the overall objectives of the directive is to achieve interoperability between the competent authorities, and between PSCs and authorities. The Fraunhofer Institute for open communication systems (FOKUS) has been working since 10 / 2007 on an architectural framework and has built various prototypes to show possible technical configurations to meet the requirements of the EU Services Directive in Germany. The prototypes are not complete production-ready implementations by themselves, but they are useful to discuss further details and to-do's. Current work continues with the incorporation of identity frameworks such as the federID-Open Source Project or the Identity-Metasystem. With these results in mind, we realize that most of all there is a need for the standardization of Identity and Access Management (IAM) on the political, organizational and semantic levels.

Pitting is detrimental as it leads to vibration, noise, loss of efficiency and eventually to the gear un-serviceability.

40|$|Abstract—Gearing is {{the special}} {{division}} of Mechanical Engineering {{concerned with the}} transmission of power and motion between the rotating shafts. Gears not only transmit motion and enormous power satisfactorily, but can do so with very uniform motion. It is {{the best and the}} economical means of achieving this transmission. Gear teeth fails due to the static and the dynamic loads acting over it, also the contact between the two meting gears causes the surface failures. The gear fails without any warning and the results due to this failure are catastrophic. Since the requirements are broad and are of varying difficulty, gearing is a complex and diversified field of engineering. It includes gear mathematics, geometrical design, strength and wear, material and metallurgy, fabrication and inspection. Therefore for all the reasons mentioned, this work is of more practical importance. To get the gear of more durability we can use improved material, hardening the gear surfaces with heat treatment and carburization, shot penning can be done to improve the surface finish, to change the pressure angle by using asymmetric teeth, introducing the stress relieving features of different shape, changing the addendum of the spur gear and altering the design of root fillet are the other methods.

40|$|AbstractDrag {{finishing}} is a {{machining process}} {{that is used to}} improve the surface topology of workpieces. Workpieces are moved through a bulk of differently shaped abrasives, the so called media. Material removal is caused by the relative motion between workpiece and media. The material removal rate is mainly depending on the contact intensity between workpiece and media. Up to now there is no viable way to determine the intensity <b>of</b> <b>single</b> <b>contacts</b> empirically. However, a sound understanding <b>of</b> <b>single</b> <b>contacts</b> with respect to impact forces and velocities could greatly improve process comprehension and reduce trial and error process design efforts. For that reason the movement of media and workpiece is modelled using the Discrete Element Method (DEM). In this paper a comprehensive approach is presented covering formulation, calibration, validation and utilization of the DEM. Media is considered as an aggregation of elastic particles that are subject to contact, damping and gravitational forces causing particle movement. Geometric boundary conditions, i. e. workpiece and drag finishing bowl, are implemented as elastic facets. Contact forces are calculated according to a non-linear, simplified Hertz-Mindlin contact force model. Energy is dissipated by viscous damping and friction at contacts. Necessary parameters of the model are determined experimentally. The validation of the model's behaviour shows good agreement with experimental data. Finally the model is used to determine local contact intensities on the workpiece surface and between particles.
