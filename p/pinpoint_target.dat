" Genetic and genomic metaphors have remained relatively stable for a long time but are now beginning to shift in the context of synthetic biology and epigenetics. This article charts the emergence of metaphors in the context of epigenetics, first through collecting some examples of metaphors in scientific and popular writing and second through a systematic analysis of metaphors used in two UK broadsheets. Findings show that while source domains for metaphors can be identified, such as our knowledge of electrical switches or of bookmarks, it is difficult to <b>pinpoint</b> <b>target</b> domains for such metaphors. This may be indicative both of struggles over what epigenetics means for scientists (natural and social) and of difficulties associated with talking about this, as yet, young field in the popular press...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Edges {{in social}} network graphs can model {{sensitive}} relationships. In this paper, {{we consider the}} problem of edges anonymity in graphs. We propose a probabilistic notion of edge anonymity, called graph confidence, which is general enough to capture the privacy breach made by an adversary {{who is able to}} <b>pinpoint</b> <b>target</b> persons in a graph partition based on any given set of topological features of vertexes. We then focus on a special type of edge anonymity problem which uses vertex degree to partition a graph. We analyze edge disclosure in real-world social networks and show that even if graphs are anonymized to prevent vertex disclosure, they still do not guarantee edge anonymity. We present three heuristic algorithms that protect edge anonymity using edge swap or edge deletion. Our experimental results, based on three real-world social networks and several utility measures, show that these algorithms can effectively protect edge anonymity and obtain anonymous graphs of acceptable utility.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of StatisticsHaiyan WangCancer type {{classification}} {{with high}} throughput molecular data has received much attention. Many {{methods have been}} published in this area. One of them is called PAM (nearest centroid shrunken algorithm), which is simple and efficient. It can give very good prediction accuracy. A problem with PAM is that this method selects too many genes, some of which may have no influence on cancer type. A reason for this phenomenon is that PAM assumes that all genes have identical distribution and give a common threshold parameter for genes selection. This may not hold in reality since expressions from different genes could have very different distributions due to complicated biological process. We propose a new method aimed to improve the ability of PAM to select informative genes. Keeping informative genes while reducing false positive variables can lead to more accurate classification result and help to <b>pinpoint</b> <b>target</b> genes for further studies. To achieve this goal, we introduce variable specific test based on Edgeworth expansion to select informative genes. We apply this test on each gene and select some genes based on the result of the test so {{that a large number of}} genes will be excluded. Afterward, soft thresholding with cross-validation can be further applied to decide a common threshold value. Simulation and real application show that our method can reduce the irrelevant information and select the informative genes more precisely. The simulation results give us more insight about where the newly proposed procedure could improve the accuracy, especially when the data set is skewed or unbalanced. The method can be applied to broad molecular data, including, for example, lipidomic data from mass spectrum, copy number data from genomics, eQLT analysis with GWAS data, etc. We expect the proposed method will help life scientists to accelerate discoveries with highthroughput data...|$|E
40|$|The Tuscaloosa Marine Shale (TMS) was {{deposited}} across southern Louisiana and Mississippi {{during the}} Upper Cretaceous. The study {{focuses on a}} core region containing vast deposits of Cretaceous-aged sediments that have economic importance {{for oil and gas}} exploration. This region has been conventionally drilled for decades, focusing on the recovery of the Cretaceous hydrocarbons. Explorers within this region had traditionally targeted the massive sand units of the Lower and Upper Tuscaloosa Group while neglecting the middle Tuscaloosa Marine Shale unit. With the onset of unconventional drilling technology, new explorers to the region have begun to delineate the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale’s capability for commercial production requiring a more detailed geologic investigation of how this area formed and what factors lend to the viability of this region. This study evaluated the geologic history and formation of the Tuscaloosa Group sediments within the core of the producing basin. Petrophysical logs were used to evaluate the complexity of the study area and the formations depositional features. The data from these logs were used to analyze the structure of the shale unit to develop structural maps of the Lower Tuscaloosa Formation and the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale. The analyses of this study found that the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale exhibited a relatively stable deposition across the study area, consisting of sediments high in clay and mica content. The Tuscaloosa Group represents a full transgressive-regressive cycle directly influencing the deposition of a basal massive sand unit, followed by the deposition of marine shale on a large shelf environment capped with the deposition of sands as the ocean transgressed seaward. The Tuscaloosa Marine Shale was found to have localized depositional variance generated from regional tectonic events coupled with the influx of terrigenous sediments from multiple deltas contributing to the prograding oceanfront. The study area yields high economic significance for further hydrocarbon exploration given the estimates of a seven billion barrel resource potential within the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale unit. New unconventional technology in the industry will allow for this area to be better delineated given the deeper depths to the shale unit and will allow for greater extraction volumes to occur. Studies similar to this report allow for petroleum explorers and others to gain the geologic insight needed in order to more accurately <b>pinpoint</b> <b>target</b> areas for new drilling to take place in an otherwise expanding region...|$|E

As the mission changed from short-range tactical bombing to over-the-pole nuclear delivery, the (newly formed) US Air Force lost interest in the concept.
