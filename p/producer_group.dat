40|$|Poor {{organisation}} {{of agricultural}} markets in Poland {{remains one of}} the biggest problems for agricultural sector. There are about 510 agricultural <b>producer</b> <b>groups,</b> but only 2 % of Polish farmers selling for market are members. Knowledge on cooperation determinants and different aspects of <b>producer</b> <b>groups</b> performance is crucial to build references for policy makers and producer groups&# 8217; managers. The aim of the article was to discuss factors affecting success of <b>producers</b> <b>groups</b> understood as a level of members&# 8217; satisfaction. Data for 2006 and 2011 from 30 <b>producers</b> <b>groups</b> in fruit and vegetable sector were analysed using logit model.

Identifi cation of factors that affect {{the improvement of the}} competitiveness of <b>producer</b> <b>groups</b> in the food chain can help in the development of such entities. The aim of the publication is to present activities that should improve competitiveness in the food chain which are undertaken by groups of raw materials producers on the example of fruit and vegetable <b>producers</b> <b>groups</b> operating in Kujawsko-Pomorskie region. In studies the method of participant observation interview were used.

40|$|In {{the light}} of horticultural market globalization, Polish {{producers}} who operate on small area of cultivation and use poor technical facilities, become uncompetitive {{in relation to the}} horticultural producer of the EU- 15. One solution of this problem is to cooperate within fruit and vegetables <b>producers</b> <b>groups.</b> It increases the potential of the horticultural market, allows to sell products at higher prices, as well as eliminate indirect distribution channels. In addition, associated producers can purchase and use production materials and conduct promotional activities. It was examined how, in practice, joint activities of farm owners in established groups are carried out, what the reasons for the accession to the <b>producer</b> <b>groups</b> are and how producers assess their decisions. The study was conducted on fruit and vegetable <b>producers</b> <b>groups</b> and organisations from Grójec and Rawa regions. The studies support the view of the growing interest in the interaction of <b>groups</b> of <b>producers.</b> Joint cooperation improves prospering of horticultural farms and increases their market potential. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of agricultural trade barriers accomplished {{at the close}} of the Uruguay Round (UR) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is a puzzle because previous research has suggested that <b>producer</b> <b>groups</b> would always succeed in blocking liberalization efforts. The author explains this apparent puzzle through the use of a comparative historical method devel-oped by Collier and Collier for analyzing the UR as a critical juncture. The analysis suggests that transformations in productive technology enabled <b>producer</b> <b>groups</b> to reap extraordinary eco-nomic and political rents during most of the post–World War II era. However, the fiscal crises of the 1980 s provided governments an incentive to exert relative autonomy from <b>producer</b> <b>groups</b> and initiate bargaining over trade barriers. As trade barriers and the political influence of pro-ducer groups were reduced, the UR emerged as the product of a critical juncture in the transition from the Fordist to the post-Fordist mode of agricultural accumulation...|$|R

40|$|We examine {{competition}} between <b>groups</b> of <b>producers</b> when consumers prefer costly `ethical' production technologies. Consumers {{are unable to}} identify or monitor production technologies. Producers can freeride on their group's `reputation' by substituting cheaper `unethical' technologies. When an ethical technology is Pareto-optimal, social pressures within competing <b>producer</b> <b>groups</b> can ensure long-run dominance of groups relying most heavily on the ethical technology. Even if social pressures cannot support {{the choice of the}} ethical technology in the long run, {{competition between}} <b>producer</b> <b>groups</b> can increase the average level of adoption of the ethical technology for an arbitrarily long period of time...|$|R

5000|$|Quality Management Systems: There {{is a lack}} of {{coherence}} {{in quality}} management systems (QMS) procedures amongst most standards-based initiatives. Most initiatives allow group certification for organized smallholders on the condition that they apply some form of Internal Control System (ICS). At present, the ICS's required by the different standards bodies are neither standardized nor consistent and, more importantly, do not always promote a sound [...] "business management" [...] approach. One <b>producer</b> <b>group</b> should have only one ICS (or QMS) even if the group wishes to comply with more than one global standard. By ensuring that the technical assistance package delivered through SCAN includes comprehensive training on best practices in QMS, producers will improve their ability to successfully comply and gain improved market access.|$|E
