5|$|Triton {{was to be}} {{the lead}} ship of a {{proposed}} class of nuclear-powered radar <b>picket</b> submarines. A December 1955 long-range naval planning report envisioned five carrier strike groups, each supported by two radar <b>picket</b> submarines. The total force included two non-nuclear Sailfish class submarines and eight nuclear submarines. With construction costs for Triton escalating, this long-range requirement was revised in 1957 to provide four nuclear-powered radar <b>picket</b> submarines for a single nuclear-powered carrier group, with the four remaining conventionally powered carrier groups supported by two diesel-electric radar <b>picket</b> submarines each.|$|E
5|$|In April 1989, {{after the}} miners had worked 14 months without benefits, UMWA {{president}} Richard Trumka declared a strike against the Pittston Coal Company. Around 2,000 UMWA members {{who worked for}} Pittston {{walked out of the}} mines and reported to the <b>picket</b> line. Pittston responded to the strike by hiring replacement workers. To ensure that production would continue, Pittston also had help from the state police to escort the replacement miners and coal trucks across the <b>picket</b> line.|$|E
5|$|The ships' {{standard}} {{crew was}} 31officers and 446enlisted men, {{with an additional}} 9officers and 41enlisted while serving as a second command flagship. After their reconstruction into training ships, the crew was substantially enlarged to incorporate the trainees, with 26officers and 658sailors, 75 of whom were naval cadets and 300 others were cabin boys. The ships carried a number of smaller boats, including three <b>picket</b> boats, one launch, one pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and three dinghies. After their modernization, the boats were significantly revised; the number of <b>picket</b> boats was reduced to one, a barge and a launch were added, the dinghies were removed, and five more cutters were added.|$|E
50|$|Secondary <b>picketing</b> people <b>picketing</b> {{locations}} that {{directly connected to}} the issue of protest. That would include component suppliers on which the <b>picketed</b> business relies, retail stores that sell products by the company against which is being <b>picketed,</b> sister companies of the company involved in the dispute and the private homes of the company's management. In many jurisdictions, secondary <b>pickets</b> {{do not have the same}} civil law protection as primary <b>pickets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Informational <b>picketing</b> is {{the legal}} name given {{to the type of}} <b>picketing</b> {{described}} above. Informational <b>picketing,</b> as described by Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law, entails <b>picketing</b> by a group, typically a labour or trade union, which inform the public about a matter of concern important to the union. It is a popular <b>picketing</b> technique for nurses to use outside of healthcare facilities. For example, on April 5, 2006 nurses of the UMass Memorial Medical Center (UMMHC) participated in two separate informational <b>picketing</b> events to protect the quality of their nursing program. Informational <b>picketing</b> was used to gain public support and promote further bargaining with management.|$|R
5000|$|A third {{important}} difference {{is under the}} FLRA it is an unfair labor practice for labor unions to call or participate in <b>picketing</b> that interferes with the operation of a federal agency, employee <b>picketing</b> under the Statute may consist of [...] "informational" [...] <b>picketing</b> only. Under the NLRA, appropriate <b>picketing</b> is a right guaranteed to private sector employees. <b>Picketing</b> allowed by the Statute must not disrupt {{the operations of the}} agency. It also may not occur while the employees are on duty.|$|R
5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States in January 1919, O'Brien returned to European waters in May to serve {{as one of the}} <b>picket</b> ships for the NC-type seaplanes in the first aerial crossing of the Atlantic. O'Brien was decommissioned at Philadelphia in June 1922. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in March 1935 sold for scrapping in April.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} mount {{between the}} military and the people of Wausau, a riot is started at a <b>picket</b> line. The revivers and the glowing men escape the dairy farm and begin to attack the military. The glowing men are able to possess bodies, prompting a shoot-on-sight response from panicked soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Blitz and Pfeil had {{a crew of}} 7officers and 127enlisted men, {{though this}} number was later revised to 6officers and 135sailors. When serving as torpedo boat {{flotilla}} leaders, the ships had an additional 3officers and 16enlisted men. The ships carried several smaller boats, including one <b>picket</b> boat, one yawl, and one dinghy. Later in their careers, a cutter, another yawl, and another dinghy were added.|$|E
50|$|<b>Picketing</b> {{in labor}} {{negotiations}} {{is an example}} of negative leverage. The goal of <b>picketing</b> is to attract negative attention to the employer, but the employees do not gain any material benefits from the act of <b>picketing</b> itself.|$|R
50|$|WBC <b>pickets</b> {{approximately}} six locations every day, {{including many}} in Topeka and some events farther afield. On Sundays, up to 15 churches may receive <b>pickets.</b> By their own count, WBC has <b>picketed</b> in all 50 U.S. states.|$|R
5000|$|Most of North Derbyshire was <b>picketed</b> out, {{but only}} five pits in Nottinghamshire were <b>picketed</b> {{out by the}} week ending on 24 October 1969. Nottinghamshire NUM {{officials}} complained of [...] "hooliganism" [...] from the flying <b>pickets</b> {{and called for a}} police presence.|$|R
5|$|In 1983, Greyhound {{operated}} {{a fleet of}} 3,800 buses and carried about 60 percent of the United States' bus-travel market. Starting November 2, 1983, Greyhound suffered a major and bitter drivers' strike with one fatality in Zanesville, Ohio, when a company bus ran over a worker at a <b>picket</b> line. A new contract was ratified December 19, and drivers returned to work the next day.|$|E
5|$|Scharnhorst and Gneisenau had a crew {{of between}} 56 to 60 {{officers}} and 1,613 to 1,780 enlisted men. The crew was augmented by another 10 officers and 61 men when serving as a squadron flagship. They carried a number of smaller watercraft, including two <b>picket</b> boats, two launches, two barges, two pinnaces, two cutters, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships of}} the Bayern class had a {{standard}} crew of 42 officers and 1,129 enlisted men; when {{serving as a}} squadron flagship, an additional 14 officers and 86 men were required.

5000|$|In the US, any strike {{activity}} {{was hard to}} organise in the early 1900s, but <b>picketing</b> became more common after the Norris-LaGuardia Act of 1932, which limited the ability of employers to gain injunctions to stop strikes, and further legislation to support the right to organise for the unions. Mass <b>picketing</b> and secondary <b>picketing</b> was however outlawed by the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. [...] Some kinds of <b>pickets</b> are constitutionally protected.|$|R
2500|$|Under Paul Herzog, the NLRB {{made two}} {{decisions}} involving secondary <b>picketing.</b> The first, Schulz Refrigeration Service, addressed an issue which had arisen in the transportation industry. Delivery trucks were {{an extension of}} the primary employer's business. But was <b>picketing</b> the truck while it visited a secondary employer (the secondary site, or [...] "secondary situs" [...] in the Latin phrase) a violation of Section 8(b)(4)? The Herzog Board said no. The second decision, Crowley's Milk Co., addressed the purpose of [...] "secondary situs" [...] <b>picketing.</b> Section 8(b)(4) of the Taft-Hartley Act (enacted the year before Crowley's Milk was decided) forbade secondary boycotts. But did it forbid secondary <b>picketing?</b> Could the union's freedom of speech extend to [...] "secondary situs" [...] <b>picketing</b> if the sole purpose of the <b>picketing</b> was to persuade consumers to boycott the secondary employer? [...] The Herzog Board said such <b>picketing</b> was legal.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the union dispute, many club patrons no longer visited the night spot. Those who were {{performers}} were informed of the possibility of fines and suspensions by their respective unions for crossing the Stork Club <b>picket</b> line as the issue continued. Many of Billingsley's friendships, including those of Walter Winchell and J. Edgar Hoover, were over as {{a result of}} the union problems. He began firing staff without good cause. As the dispute dragged on, there was also no longer a live band in the dining room for music; members of the Musicians' Union had crossed the <b>picket</b> line to perform for some time. Previously, the club had no need for advertising; it was mentioned frequently in print and word of mouth without it. In 1963, the club offered a hamburger and French fries for $1.99 in a New York Times advertisement; when those in the know about the club saw it, they realized the Stork Club's days were coming to an end. In the last few months of its operation, at times there were only three customers for the entire evening. On a good day in the mid-1940s, some 2,500 people visited the club.|$|E
5|$|At first, St. Leger {{tried to}} intimidate the fort's {{occupants}} by parading his troops—including the Indians in their war dress—in {{front of the}} fort. When this failed he sent a truce flag bearing a proclamation authored by General Burgoyne; Gansevoort refused to respond. St. Leger then began siege operations, encamping the regulars and artillery on a low rise north of the fort, {{and most of the}} Indians and Loyalists to its south, with a <b>picket</b> line of Indian encampments along the Mohawk River.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before her}} launch, there was {{considerable}} discussion of Tritons role beyond her radar <b>picket</b> mission. An internal Navy memorandum set forth four options for the submarine's extended use. These included configuration {{to serve as a}} command ship (SSCN) for a fleet or force commander, an advanced sonar scout for the fleet, a Regulus missile submarine (SSGN), or a minelaying submarine. However, {{with the exception of the}} command ship option, all of these proposed configurations required extensive modification of her original design.|$|E

5000|$|Dolphin {{obtained}} {{an injunction}} against secondary <b>picketing</b> on their premises {{on the basis}} that the common law does not permit secondary <b>picketing.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{injunction}} restricted <b>picketing</b> {{to groups}} of two. Judge Hoge left {{it up to the}} discretion of sheriffs' deputies how far apart each group must be. Initially, the union established 34 <b>pickets</b> at least 25 feet (8 m) apart. Deputies arrested half the strikers. [...] The union increased the distance between <b>pickets</b> to 50 yards (16 m), and still arrests occurred. [...] Distance between <b>pickets</b> was extended to 100 yards (90 m), then {{a quarter of a mile}} (400 m), and in some cases a half mile (800 m). [...] Arrests continued. On a number of occasions, deputies called <b>pickets</b> together and, when they obeyed, arrested them for congregating unlawfully.|$|R
5|$|Given the {{willingness}} of the players to cross the <b>picket</b> lines and networks to broadcast the replacement games, despite a 20% drop in television viewership and even steeper drops in attendance, the union failed to achieve their demands. The strike ended on October 15, 1987, without a collective bargaining agreement in place. The union filed a new antitrust lawsuit on December 30 asking federal judge David Doty to overturn the league's restricting free agent policies.|$|E

5|$|Leipzig {{initially}} had {{a crew of}} 26officers and 508enlisted men. Later in her career, {{the crew}} grew to 30officers and 628sailors and then again to 24officers and 826sailors. She could also accommodate an admiral's staff of 6officers and 20enlisted men when she was serving as a flagship. Nürnbergs crew started as 25officers and 648ratings, and {{over the course of}} her career swelled to 26officers and 870enlisted men. The ships carried two <b>picket</b> boats, two barges, two launches, and two cutters.|$|E
5000|$|Disruptive <b>picketing</b> {{is where}} <b>pickets</b> {{illegally}} use force, or {{the threat of}} force, or physical obstruction, to injure or intimidate or otherwise interfere with either staff, service users, or customers.

5|$|Maryland was {{assigned}} targets {{on the southern}} coast of Okinawa to support a diversionary landing, which would distract Japanese forces away from the main landing on the west coast. Japanese forces responded with several air raids, with two of Marylands radar <b>picket</b> destroyers being struck by kamikaze planes, with Luce sinking. On 3 April, she {{was moved to the}} west coast invasion beaches to assist Minneapolis in destroying several shore batteries. Following the land invasion, she remained with the support force off Bolo Point providing artillery support for the invading troops.|$|E
5|$|Rick Neuheisel {{came off}} the bench to lead the Chargers to three second-half scores. Partly based on this performance, the Buccaneers later signed Neuheisel as a backup quarterback. Although many veteran NFL players crossed the <b>picket</b> line during the week, the Buccaneers were one of only six teams to have no players cross. More than 1,000 area union members joined the Buccaneers regulars in {{picketing}} the game, with some fans tearing up their tickets and joining them.|$|E
5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} {{with a single}} rudder. The vessels handled well and had a tight turning radius, but they suffered from weather helm and tended to drift while underway. The ships' crew numbered ten officers and 191enlisted men, and later increased to eleven officers and 197enlisted men. The ships carried several smaller boats, including two <b>picket</b> boats, one launch, two yawls, and one dinghy. These were handled with a large derrick that was fitted to the main mast.|$|E
50|$|No. - The record {{before the}} Supreme Court {{does not contain}} {{sufficient}} justification for this broad ban on <b>picketing,</b> it appears that a limitation, on the time, duration of <b>picketing,</b> and number of <b>pickets</b> outside a smaller zone could have accomplished the desired result, while placing a lesser restriction on the Petitioners’ First Amendment constitutional rights.|$|R
