50|$|A recent {{development}} in calorimetry, however, {{is that of}} constant flux cooling/heating jackets.

Heat consumed is compensated either by an electric heater or by reversing the polarity of the device (van Herwaarden, 2000). If a given instrument is operated in pc mode rather than hc, the precision of heat flow measurement remains the same (e.g. ca. ±0.2 μW).

Wind turbines with variable-speed generators have the potential to add synthetic inertia to the grid and assist in frequency control. Hydro-Québec began requiring synthetic inertia in 2005 as the first grid operator, demanding a temporary 6% power boost when countering frequency drop by combining the power electronics with the rotational inertia of a wind turbine rotor.

50|$|A {{variation}} of the 'heat flow' technique is called 'power compensation' calorimetry. This method uses a cooling jacket operating at constant flow and temperature. The process temperature is regulated by adjusting {{the power of the}} electrical heater. When the experiment is started, the electrical heat and the cooling power (of the cooling jacket) are in balance. As the process heat load changes, the electrical power is varied {{in order to maintain the}} desired process temperature. The heat liberated or absorbed by the process is determined from the difference between the initial electrical power and the demand for electrical power at the time of measurement. The <b>power</b> <b>compensation</b> method is easier to set up than heat flow calorimetry but it suffers from the similar limitations since any change in product composition, liquid level, process temperature, agitation rate or viscosity will upset the calibration. The presence of an electrical heating element is also undesirable for process operations. The method is further limited by the fact that the largest heat it can measure is equal to the initial electrical power applied to the heater.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} two simplified {{models to}} determine nodal voltages in power distribution networks. These models allow estimating {{the impact of}} the installation of reactive <b>power</b> <b>compensations</b> equipments like fixed or switched capacitor banks. The procedure used to develop the models is similar to the procedure used to develop linear power flow models of transmission lines, which have been widely used in optimization problems of operation planning and system expansion. The steady state non-linear load flow equations are approximated by linear equations relating the voltage amplitude and currents. The approximations of the linear equations are based on the high relationship between line resistance and line reactance (ratio R/X), which is valid for power distribution networks. The performance and accuracy of the models are evaluated through comparisons with the exact results obtained from the solution of the load flow using two test networks: a hypothetical network with 23 nodes and a real network with 217 nodes.
