5|$|In June 2014, RatPac Entertainment and Class 5 Films {{acquired}} the non-fiction article American Hippopotamus, by Jon Mooallem, about the meat shortage in the U.S. in 1910 and the attempts made by Burnham, Duquesne and Congressman Robert Broussard to import hippopotamuses into the Louisiana bayous and to convince Americans to eat them. The movie will highlight the Burnham - Duquesne rivalry. Edward Norton, William Migliore and Brett Ratner will <b>produce</b> <b>this</b> feature film.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{which can}} be {{transmitted}} from one organism to another are known as infectious diseases, and the causative biological agent involved {{is known as a}} pathogen. The process by which the pathogen is introduced into the body is known as inoculation, and the organism it affects is known as a biological host. When the pathogen establishes itself in a step known as colonization, it can result in an infection, consequently harming the host directly or through the harmful substances called toxins it can <b>produce.</b> <b>This</b> results in the various symptoms and signs characteristic of an infectious disease like pneumonia or diphtheria.|$|E
5|$|During {{his final}} years, and {{especially}} {{after the death of}} Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit signs of megalomania and paranoia. His extraordinary achievements, coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions, may have combined to <b>produce</b> <b>this</b> effect. His delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world, in as much as he is by various sources described as having boundless ambition, an epithet, the meaning of which has descended into an historical cliché.|$|E

5|$|It premiered on TBS on April 6, 2006 and {{concluded}} on September 14, 2006, continuing the storyline from season one. Season two concluded with episode 22, although the Japanese and North American DVD releases include episodes 23 and 24. It was released to DVD in Japan between July 2006 and February 2007 by Bandai Visual. Media Blasters, who released the first season, declined to <b>produce</b> <b>this</b> season; it was licensed to ADV Films instead. ADV Films released the season on six DVD compilations, each containing four episodes, between May and March 2007. The rights were {{then transferred to}} Funimation, who released a boxed set on November 25, 2007.|$|E
5|$|P. fimbriata {{does not}} stalk at all {{species of the}} ant-mimic jumping spider genus Myrmarachne, and uses cryptic {{stalking}} only about 20% of the time against other ant-mimicking salticids and against beetle-mimicking salticids. P. fimbriata also sometimes does not use cryptic stalking against females of the salticid subfamily Lyssomaninae. These females are unusually translucent, and the translucent cuticle makes the anterior-median eyes (front-and-center) show light and dark regions that flicker in and out when viewed head on. Lyssomanine males are not translucent and do not <b>produce</b> <b>this</b> flickering, and P. fimbriata uses cryptic stalking consistently against the males. This suggests that the flickering anterior-median eyes of lyssomanine females may reduce the ability of P. fimbriata to identify these females as jumping spiders.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War {{had a major}} {{effect on}} the {{development}} of Indiana. Before the war, the population was generally in the south of the state, where many had entered via the Ohio River, which provided a cheap and convenient means to export products and agriculture to New Orleans to be sold. The war closed the Mississippi River to traffic for nearly four years, forcing Indiana to find other means to export its <b>produce.</b> <b>This</b> led to a population shift to the north where the state came to rely more on the Great Lakes and the railroad for exports.|$|E

5|$|The ampullae of Lorenzini are the electroreceptor organs. They {{number in}} the {{hundreds}} to thousands. Sharks use the ampullae of Lorenzini to detect the electromagnetic fields that all living things <b>produce.</b> <b>This</b> helps sharks (particularly the hammerhead shark) find prey. The shark has the greatest electrical sensitivity of any animal. Sharks find prey hidden in sand by detecting the electric fields they produce. Ocean currents moving in the magnetic field of the Earth also generate electric fields that sharks can use for orientation and possibly navigation.|$|E
5|$|The game {{needed a}} 32 megabit battery backed-up {{cartridge}} to work properly, and was expensive to <b>produce.</b> <b>This</b> factor deterred some publishers, alongside {{the fact that}} launching a new intellectual property was considered risky. WayForward {{tried to find a}} publisher for years, before Capcom eventually picked the game for release. Capcom, however, held back the release for months, during which the Game Boy Advance was released. It is rumored that the game had only one run of 20–25,000 copies. WayForward saw that the console's screen had a tendency to darken the colours, so they took back the game and made further developments on it, incorporating a feature to brighten the screen if played on a Game Boy Advance, alongside some bonus features.|$|E
5|$|The morale {{system in}} the game is similar to {{previous}} Dynasty Warrior games. Morale is increased and decreased by performing a number of positive actions for the player’s army. Action that <b>produce</b> <b>this</b> effect include defeating enemies in multiples of fifty, defeating enemy officers, and completing special events such as ambushes, siege attacks, and finding enemy strongholds. Morale in the game has a strong effect on the player's forces, determining their strength and speed, {{as well as their}} ability to perform Berwald attacks. Morale will also affect how the CPU characters move along through battle. Example: Ally Oxenstiernas are winning.|$|E

5|$|Where {{there was}} an {{existing}} castle on a site, another response across 19th-century Europe was to attempt to improve the buildings, bringing their often chaotic historic features into line with a more integrated architectural aesthetic, in a style often termed Gothic Revivalism. There were numerous attempts to restore or rebuild keeps so as to <b>produce</b> <b>this</b> consistently Gothic style: in England, the architect Anthony Salvin was particularly prominent – as illustrated by reworking and heightening of the keep at Windsor Castle, while in France, Eugène Viollet-le-Duc reworked the keeps at castles in locations like Pierrefonds during the 1860s and 1870s, admittedly in a largely speculative fashion, since the original keep had been mostly destroyed in 1617.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have soft {{bodies with}} thin skins, and lack claws, {{defensive}} armour, or spines. Nevertheless, they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive. The {{first line of}} defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they <b>produce.</b> <b>This</b> keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip. The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic. Snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis), which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape. Caecilians have been little studied in this respect, but the Cayenne caecilian (Typhlonectes compressicauda) produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in Brazil. In some salamanders, the skin is poisonous. The rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa) from North America {{and other members of}} its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX), the most toxic non-protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish. Handling the newts does not cause harm, but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly. In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible. The only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis).|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Sisimpur {{aired in}} Bangladesh. This co-production's {{goal was to}} improve school {{achievement}} and decrease drop-out rates for children before the third grade. This difficult co-production, which was beset by political difficulties and severe flooding that delayed production, was depicted in the 2006 documentary The World According to Sesame Street. Also in 2005, the producers of the Kosovo co-production (Rruga Sesam/Ulica Sezam) chose to present the languages of the region more evenly. Instead of showing words on screen, children were challenged to label objects verbally, thus learning that there are different ways {{to say the same}} thing. The Workshop worked in conjunction with UNICEF to <b>produce</b> <b>this</b> show, to aid in the peace process between Albanians and Serbs. One of its goals was to demonstrate to Albanian and Serbian children that their counterparts were like them.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, Norton played Mike Shiner, a prickly Broadway {{actor in}} the black comedy film Birdman and was {{nominated}} for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the role. On February 20, 2014, {{it was announced that}} Norton was directing Motherless Brooklyn. In June 2014, Norton's Class 5 Films and RatPac Entertainment acquired the film rights to the non-fiction article American Hippopotamus, by Jon Mooallem, about the meat shortage in the U.S. in 1910 and the attempts made by Major Frederick Russell Burnham, Captain Fritz Joubert Duquesne and Congressman Robert Broussard to import hippopotami into the Louisiana bayous and persuade Americans to eat them. The film highlights the rivalry between Burnham and Duquesne, two famous spies who had been under orders to assassinate each other.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{calculated}} that the isotope 295Ts would have a half-life of 18±7milliseconds and {{that it may be}} possible to <b>produce</b> <b>this</b> isotope via the same berkelium–calcium reaction used in the discoveries of the known isotopes, 293Ts and 294Ts. The chance of this reaction producing 295Ts is estimated to be, at most, one-seventh the chance of producing 294Ts. Calculations using a quantum tunneling model predict the existence of several isotopes of tennessine up to 303Ts. The most stable of these is expected to be 296Ts with an alpha-decay half-life of 40milliseconds. A liquid drop model study on the element's isotopes shows similar results; it suggests a general trend of increasing stability for isotopes heavier than 301Ts, with partial half-lives exceeding the age of the universe for the heaviest isotopes like 335Ts when beta decay is not considered. Lighter isotopes of tennessine may be produced in the 243Am+50Ti reaction, which was considered as a contingency plan by the Dubna team in 2008 if 249Bk proved unavailable,Ca + 238U-249Cf |trans-title=Synthesis of new elements 113–118 in complete fusion reactions 48Ca + 238U–249Cf |last=Utyonkov |first=V.

5|$|Much of the Cetacean Institute, Taylor's workplace, {{was created}} by using the real-life Monterey Bay Aquarium. A holding tank for the whales was added via special effects to the Aquarium's exterior. For close-ups of the {{characters}} as they watched the whales in the tank, the Aquarium's walls and railings were measured and replicated for a set on the Paramount parking lot. One scene takes place by a large glass through which observers view the whales—and Spock's initiation of a mind meld—underwater. Footage of the actors shot {{in front of them}} as they reacted to a brick wall in the Aquarium was combined with shots taken from their rear as they stood in front of a large blue screen at ILM to <b>produce</b> <b>this</b> scene. The footage of Spock's melding with the whales was shot weeks later in a large water tank used to train astronauts for weightlessness.|$|E

5|$|Qwak! was {{released}} in a standard upright arcade cabinet with {{a black and white}} raster television monitor inset, with the rifle holster and start button below as the only controls. The reeds and tree branch overlay is screen printed in color onto a clear panel in front of the monitor, and is backlit by the screen; the screen is lit with a gray background instead of a black one in order to <b>produce</b> <b>this</b> effect. When the gun is triggered, the duck additionally flashes white briefly, so as to be detected by the light gun; the relative brightness of the screen makes this effect less obvious than with other similar light gun games. Qwak! was not the first light gun video game; it was preceded by the arcade game Balloon Gun (August 1974) and a light gun game for the Magnavox Odyssey video game console (1972), as well as non-video game light gun games since the 1936 Seeberg Ray-O-Lite.|$|E
5|$|The M22 Locust, officially Light Tank (Airborne), M22, was an American-designed {{airborne}} light tank {{which was}} produced during World War II. The Locust began development in 1941 after the British War Office {{requested that the}} American government design a purpose-built airborne light tank which could be transported by glider into battle to support British airborne forces. The War Office had originally selected the Light Tank Mark VII Tetrarch light tank {{for use by the}} airborne forces, but it had not been designed with that exact purpose in mind so the War Office believed that a purpose-built tank would be required to replace it. The United States Ordnance Department was asked to <b>produce</b> <b>this</b> replacement, which in turn selected Marmon-Herrington to design and build a prototype airborne tank in May 1941. The prototype was designated the Light Tank T9 (Airborne), and was designed so that it could be transported underneath a Douglas C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft, although its dimensions also allowed it to fit inside a General Aircraft Hamilcar glider.|$|E
5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} step-down transformer and for direct current models a rectifier, which converts alternating current into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage alternating current, the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to <b>produce</b> <b>this</b> effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current. The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the number of turns in the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.|$|E
