40|$|The 1831 Belgian Constitution {{restored}} the jury trial for criminal matters, press offences and political offences. The latter was copied from the 1830 French Charte constitutionnelle, {{but despite the}} fact that this was a terminological novelty in the western legal tradition, no definition was given. The Belgian constituent did so on purpose, as it enlarged the interpretative role of the jury. In this regard, it was even attributed a double role, the jurors did not only have to judge on the substance of the case, but on the interpretation of the criminal provisions as well, which were often vague in political matters. However, in Belgian legal practice, the judicial authorities soon lost faith in jury trials and a case-law was developed which substantially narrowed the definition of the political offence, which eventually led to a fossilization of the constitutional ideal. Hence, <b>professional</b> <b>magistrates</b> have succeeded in developing a strategic way to avoid a popular judgment in political matters without violating the constitution...|$|R

We observed a post-deliberation increase in pre-deliberation bias such that the non-diagnostic psychological expertise had a stronger post-deliberation impact on the sentence. Finally, an unexpected effect showed that aggressive responses during the psychological observation tended to operate as exculpatory rather than accusatory evidence.

40|$|The {{illegal trade}} in wild {{harvested}} {{plants and animals}} is a significant threat to populations and species worldwide. There is concern that in many countries sanctions for wildlife trade crimes are insufficient {{to act as a}} deterrent, and do not reflect the seriousness of offences. For these reasons {{it is important to understand}} professional and public opinions as to which aspects of such crimes make them more or less serious, and so deserving of a greater or lesser sentence. Conjoint analysis, a method used in marketing to understand which characteristics of a product are valued by consumers, was used to investigate which attributes of hypothetical wildlife trade offences (threat status and taxon of species involved, illegal profit, previous convictions and plea) UK-based conservation <b>professionals,</b> <b>magistrates</b> and the general public considered most important when sentencing wildlife criminals in the UK. Eighty-seven per cent of 682 respondents completed enough of the survey to be included in the analysis. Magistrates and the public considered illegal profit to be the single most important attribute, while conservationists considered the threat status of the species involved to be most important (considered second most important by magistrates and the public). Magistrates, when presented with adequate information, considered the threat status and corresponding legal protection afforded to wildlife when considering how serious a wildlife trade crime was, and doing so is in line with public opinion on sentencing such offences. This study highlights the importance of ensuring that judiciaries are presented with information concerning both the potential profit and conservation impact of wildlife trade crimes. Sentencing councils must develop appropriate guidelines to support judiciaries in their sentencing of wildlife crimes...|$|R

40|$|Decision-making under {{conditions}} of large uncertainty {{is an issue that}} poses serious questions about the decisional chain, its complexities, the consequent responsibilities, and, ultimately, the difficulties of identifying the “right” decision to make. This paper addresses these issues from a civil protection perspective, i. e., {{from the point of view}} of an organization which often operates under highly uncertain conditions in the management of the risk cycle. Three main participants in the decision-making process are identified: scientists, political decision-makers (PDMs), and technical decision-makers (TDMs). They provide different contributions to the risk management, with frequent and intricate interactions that, however, can cause distortions in the distinction of the roles to be played, and thus of the responsibilities to be taken. In addition to scientists and decision-makers, there are other participants playing important roles in the risk cycle, and thus influencing decisions within the civil protection system, such as the technical community of professionals, the mass media, the magistrates, and the citizens. PDMs and TDMs, as well as scientists, are directly involved in the decision-making process. <b>Professionals,</b> journalists, <b>magistrates,</b> and citizens can indirectly condition decisions and their implementation. Examples are reported for all of these categories. Participants in the decisional process who understand their role and responsibilities can contribute to a more efficient and effective civil protection system, reducing the occurrence of errors and incidents, if they act within the bounds of their expertise, but avoid to adhere too rigidly to their role. How to develop a correct and fruitful interaction among all the actors is a primary target for a mature civil protection system...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} {{was to investigate the}} difference in attributions of offenders and magistrates about the factors that led to offending behaviour. Difference in beliefs between offenders and magistrates, about seriousness of some common offences and factors believed to be motives for offending, justification of offending and neutralisation of responsibility for offending were also investigated. The effect that differences in attributions between offenders and magistrates and how these influence the way in which offenders are dealt with {{in the criminal justice system}} was investigated. The attitude of criminal justice system <b>professionals,</b> and <b>magistrates</b> towards offenders was also investigated to find out if they affect court sentencing decisions, and the treatment and punishment imposed in an attempt to reduce offending. My research has shown, that offenders and magistrates hold significantly different attributions about the factors that influence people to offend, and about offence seriousness. Offenders and magistrates also hold significantly different beliefs about motives for offending, justification of offending and neutralisation of responsibility for offending. The UK Government Crime Reduction Policy since 1997, has been strongly related to the ‘What Works’ approach. This has influenced sentencing policy and the treatment of offenders. A major strand of the policy has been the introduction and implementation of the What Works’ approach and the use of Cognitive Behavioural Accredited Programmes within the Probation Service and Prison Service to change the behaviour of offenders and reduce recividism (Harper and Chitty 2005).

The value and challenges of restorative justice for adult offenders, victims and communities is thoroughly examined. The discussion is situated within current debate, available research, and the international literature. In canvassing the structure, content and delivery of key Australian and New Zealand restorative justice programs for adult offenders, the distinguished authors offer critical analysis of the emergence and impact of program developments for restorative justice practitioners, criminal justice professionals, and the criminal justice system. This collection brings together stimulating and informed articles by experienced practitioners, leading academics and new researchers in the field.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that there is an over-representation of people with learning disabilities in prison populations. Various explanations have been offered for this including theories that people with disabilities are susceptible to criminal behaviour, and that they receive different treatment within the justice system. There is no evidence of over-representation of people with learning disabilities in the UK penal system although evidence does suggest that there are a significant number of prisoners with borderline learning disabilities who are psychologically vulnerable. This research set out to examine current levels of contact that psychiatrists have with various criminal justice agencies, as well as exploring the attitudes and beliefs of other criminal justice workers in order to assess current arrangements of treatment and care for offenders who have a learning disability. 791 consultant psychiatrists registered in four sections of the Royal College of Psychiatry were surveyed to detect current levels of contact with five criminal justice agencies, and also to assess their levels of involvement with the diversion of mentally disordered offenders into health care provision. Responses indicated that forensic and general psychiatrists had the highest levels of contact with criminal justice agencies, although there was also limited contact with child and learning disability psychiatrists. Forensic psychiatrists were also shown to be the group who were most likely to be involved with diversion schemes, and there was some evidence to suggest that respondents were unhappy with current arrangements for diversion because of bed and staff shortages. An attitude survey concerning offenders with learning disabilities was distributed to 100 criminal justice <b>professionals</b> (judges, <b>magistrates,</b> police and appropriate adults). 28 of these respondents also participated in semi-structured interviews which provided qualitative data to supplement the findings of the attitude survey. These studies provided evidence that criminal justice professionals were not eager to assign special rights to people because of their learning disability status, but instead were confident that the present legal system could accommodate the needs of offenders with learning disabilities in the present system. However, significant concern was raised by all respondents that specific training in needed to address learning disability issues before this can be fully achieved. There was little evidence found to support `susceptibility' theories of learning disability offending, although there was some evidence which gave support to the `different treatment' hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|This book is {{an attempt}} to improve our {{understanding}} on the post-communist transformations by focusing on a particular and media related topic: the judicial reforms in Central and Eastern European countries and in the Balkans. Judicial reforms are many-faceted processes. The book is focused on the establishment of new borders between law and politics in the post-communist democracies, particular attention being paid to the judicial independence. Looking at understanding the policy change or policy continuity in this field, the various chapters test hypotheses derived from different branches of the political science literature or sociology (transitology, Europeanization, public policy, the international legal transfers….). Detailed case studies on Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Serbia, Romania and Poland illustrate how, and to what extent, the legislative processes related to the judicial independence have been placed under the influence of domestic or external drivers of change. With a critical analysis of the concept of judicial independence, the case studies presented in this book examine the role of the external actors such as the European Commission, the Council of Europe, the European and American experts involved in the (re) shaping of new judicial institutions in these countries, as well as the role of the domestic actors, political parties, the <b>professional</b> associations of <b>magistrates,</b> the NGOs or the judicial institutions. Judicial reforms take place in a broader social and political context in Central and Eastern European countries. By analysing theses issues the authors do not neglect the EU enlargement process and the related conditionality, the promotion of the rule of law, the development of the civil society or the process of the State rebuilding in these countries. Written for a broad audience, practitioners or scholars, the book is also addressed and recommended for use in graduate courses in sociology, political science and law. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{perspective}} to understand the local self-government movement during the late Qing New Policies era. On the one hand, this new perspective moves beyond the common practice of interpreting the local self-government movement as failed state efforts to bridle the local elite by enlisting them into bureaucracy, and instead looks {{at it from the}} perspective of local society. On the other hand, it emphasizes the relations between local self-government institutions and other contemporaneous professional associations, like the chamber of commerce, education association, agriculture association, and the anti-opium bureau. To facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the local self-government movement, this paper examines the case in Jiaxing from 1905 to 1914. This period witnessed the whole process of the first wave of the local self-government movement from its start and preparation {{in the last years of}} the Qing to its abolition by Yuan Shikai in the Republic. A clear understanding of local power structure is indispensable for researching local self-government. Previous scholars generally draw a line between upper-degree elites and lower elites, urban elites and countryside-based elites, suggesting that there were serious conflicts between upper urban elites and lower elites during the local self-government movement. My research on Jiaxing shows provides corrective to this interpretation. Traditional degrees and lineage were still important, but they were no longer major factors for elite to form establishments, seek support, and construct identity. By participating in various professional associations, Jiaxing elites gradually began to organize themselves along with associations and take action in the name of these associations. The emergence of professional associations was a significant political development in modern Chinese history. They performed many local works independently and often advocated for public benefits, local self-government and a constitutional government, either alone or together with other associations. There were numerous examples of the close cooperation between different professional associations and local self-government institutions. It were the members of professional associations who first promoted and dominated the self-government institutions. For the Jiaxing elites, local self-government was merely one among the many organizations for them to participate in local affairs and exert influence. All these linkages and cooperation between different institutions and associations contributed to a power balance in Jiaxing society in the last years of the Qing dynasty. Public management functions were clearly delineated among various associations whose members were mainly New Policies activists who wished to make the country better and stronger by building local society. There were some peasant uprisings, but during this period the urban-rural conflict may not have been essential in Jiaxing. The 1911 Revolution changed this kind of balanced local power structure among local officials, self-government institutions, and <b>professional</b> associations. <b>Magistrates</b> gradually lost their control of local society, while local assemblies and executive boards became the major decision-making institutions in the first years of the Republic. The clearly delineated functions among self-government institutions, professional associations and local governments were disrupted. Eventually in 1914, Yuan Shikai abolished all of the local self-government institutions...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho discute o Ensino Médio no {{interior}} cearense, sob os impactos da Reforma Educativa implantada pelo Ministério da Educação, a partir de meados dos anos 90, percebendo como o conjunto da Reforma chegou às escolas, principalmente, através das vertentes: currículo, gestão democrática, expansão de vagas e financiamento. O trabalho é desenvolvido em três partes. A primeira traz as bases legais e o discurso oficial utilizado pela Reforma para construir sua legitimidade (vista como a junção entre o que determina a Lei e a aceitação dela por parte da comunidade). Apresenta também os caminhos trilhados para se construir um consenso em torno da idéia e da necessidade de um Novo Ensino Médio. A segunda é dedicada a discutir a centralidade do trabalho e a crise do emprego, discutindo, inicialmente, as premissas da Reforma de que o mundo mudou e, por isso, o Ensino Médio precisa acompanhar tais mudanças. A partir das discussões sobre as mudanças no mundo do trabalho, que aponta para a perda da centralidade da categoria trabalho na sociedade contemporânea, optou-se pela discussão que reafirma, com Marx, a centralidade do trabalho, mostrando que a crise do emprego via avanços tecnológicos é algo construído historicamente pela sociedade capitalista, em busca de manter a exploração do trabalho, fazendo crescer sua lucratividade, e que vem de mãos dadas com as reformas neoliberais que visam diminuir o papel do Estado na promoção de serviços essenciais à população (como educação, saúde e ação social), aumentando somente seu poder de controle social para que o capitalismo possa seguir acumulando. A terceira parte discute, principalmente a partir de entrevistas com os professores e diretores de escolas da região, e de algumas observações de pesquisador participante, os caminhos e pretextos da Reforma nas suas principais vertentes: currículo, gestão, expansão e financiamento. A conclusão é de que a Reforma, devido à sua implementação parcial, precária de financiamento e deslocada do contexto social e educacional do interior cearense, não contribuiu para a melhoria da escola pública de Ensino Médio ali existente, tendo, inclusive, aprofundado seus históricos problemas, como o descrédito nas intervenções estatais, a política do improviso, a baixa qualidade na aprendizagem e a desvalorização dos profissionais do magistério. This work argues {{about the}} middle level education in the hinterland of Ceara, under the impacts of the Educative Reformation implanted by the Ministry of Education, from the early 90 ´s, noticing how {{the set of the}} Reformation arrived at the schools, mainly, through the sources: resume, democratic management, expansion of vacancy and financing. The work is developed in three parts. The first one brings the legal bases and the official speech used by the Reformation to build its legitimacy (seen as the junction between what it determines the Law and the acceptance of it by the community). It also presents the trodden ways to build a consensus around the idea and the necessity of a New Middle Level Educationon. The second one is dedicated to argue the centrality of work and the job crisis, arguing, initially, the premises of the Reformation that the world changed e, therefore, the Middle Level Educationon needs to follow these changes. Based on the arguments about the changes in the world of work, which leads to the loss of the centrality of work category in the contemporary society, it was chosen the arguments that reaffirms, with Marx, the work centrality, showing that the job crisis through technological advances is something built throughout the history by the capitalist society, searching to keep the work exploration, making grow its profitability, and that it comes of hands given with the neoliberal reformations that aim at reducing the state role on the promotion of essential services to the population (such as education, health and social action), increasing, only, its power to social control so that the capitalism can keep on acumulating. The third part argues, mainly, based on interviews with the professors and directors of schools on the area, and some comments of the participant researcher, the ways and excuses of the Reformation on its main sources: resume, management, expansion and financing. The conclusion is that the Reformation, due to its partial implementation, precarious of financing and dislocated of the social and educational context of the hinterland of the state of Ceara, did not contribute to the improvement of the public school of middle level education on the area, having, also, increased its historical problems, as the discredit in the state interventions, the improvisation politics, the low quality in the learning and the depreciation of the <b>professionals</b> of <b>magistrate...</b>|$|R
