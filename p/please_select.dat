6000|$|How I admire {{and wonder}} at the {{information}} in Murray's Handbooks--wonder how it is got, and admire the travellers who get it. For instance, you read: Amiens (<b>please</b> <b>select</b> your towns), 60,000 inhabitants. Hotels, &c.--"Lion d'Or," [...] good and clean. [...] "Le Lion d'Argent," [...] so so. [...] "Le Lion Noir," [...] bad, dirty, and dear. Now say, there are three travellers--three inn-inspectors, who are sent forth by Mr. Murray on a great commission, and who stop at every inn in the world. The eldest goes to the [...] "Lion d'Or"--capital house, good table-d'hote, excellent wine, moderate charges. The second commissioner tries the [...] "Silver Lion"--tolerable house, bed, dinner, bill and so forth. But fancy Commissioner No. 3--the poor fag, doubtless, and boots of the party. He {{has to go to}} the [...] "Lion Noir." [...] He knows he is to have a bad dinner--he eats it uncomplainingly. He is to have bad wine. He swallows it, grinding his wretched teeth, and aware that he will he unwell in consequence. He knows he is to have a dirty bed, and what he is to expect there. He pops out the candle. He sinks into those dingy sheets. He delivers over his body to the nightly tormentors, he pays an exorbitant bill, and he writes down, [...] "Lion Noir, bad, dirty, dear." [...] Next day the commission sets out for Arras, we will say, and they begin again: [...] "Le Cochon d'Or," [...] "Le Cochon d'Argent," [...] "Le Cochon Noir"--and that is poor Boots's inn, of course. What a life that poor man must lead! What horrors of dinners he has to go through! What a hide he must have! And yet not impervious; for unless he is bitten, how is he to be able to warn others? No: on second thoughts, you will perceive that he ought to have a very delicate skin. The monsters ought to troop to him eagerly, and bite him instantaneously and freely, so that he may be able to warn all future handbook buyers of their danger. I fancy this man devoting himself to danger, to dirt, to bad dinners, to sour wine, to damp beds, to midnight agonies, to extortionate bills. I admire him, I thank him. Think of this champion, who devotes his body for us--this dauntless gladiator going to do battle alone in the darkness, with no other armor than a light helmet of cotton, and a lorica of calico. I pity and honor him. Go, Spartacus! Go, devoted man--to bleed, to groan, to suffer--and smile in silence as the wild beasts assail thee! ...|$|E

40|$|This {{course will}} provide an {{introduction}} to the book of Psalms. It begins with the history of the interpretation of Psalms, and proceeds to {{an introduction to the}} writing and collection of the present book of Psalms. Much of the course will focus on the various types of Psalms that have been identified by modern scholarship and the study of selected examples from each type. We will also consider the meaning and message of these Psalms in their original context and for the modern world. Textbooks: Here is a bit about why each one was <b>selected.</b> <b>Please</b> understand that just because I use a textbook, {{that does not mean that}} I agree with everything in it, nor do I expect you to agree with everything.

40|$|Objective : This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to find whether persons with well-balanced face and normal occlusion demonstrate variation in skeletal and facial morphology and {{to evaluate the}} applicability of centrographic analysis as compared with conventional cephalometrics. Materials and methods : Lateral cephalograms of 50 individuals consisting of 18 males and 32 females in the age range of 18 to 25 years with normal occlusion and well-balanced <b>pleasing</b> profile were <b>selected.</b> Lateral cephalograms for these individuals were evaluated by centrographic analysis and cephalometric analysis in A-P plane and vertical plane. Results : As per centrographic analysis, Class I skeletal pattern was observed in 34 %, Class II in 10 % and Class III in 56 %. In vertical plane, 38 % of cases had normal growth pattern, 42 % of cases had horizontal growth pattern and 20 % of cases had vertical growth pattern. Comparison of centrographic analysis with cephalometric measurements revealed significant differences. In A-P plane, Class III type of skeletal morphologic pattern is more common while in vertical plane, horizontal growth pattern is more common when evaluated with centrographic analysis. Conclusion : Individuals belonging to same sample group and with well-balanced skeletal and soft tissue profiles and normal occlusion demonstrated wide variations in craniofacial structure as evaluated with centrographic analysis and routinely used conventional cephalometric measurements...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} undertaken: (1) To {{establish}} static norms {{in the central}} India population for the various smile parameters. (2) To analyze and quantify the sexual dimorphism of esthetic smile. Settings and Design: Hundred subjects (50 males and 50 females) {{with an average age}} of 14. 5 years with a <b>pleasing</b> smile were <b>selected</b> for the study. Static photographs with posed smile in natural head position (NHP) were taken. Materials and Methods: Following smile parameters were quantified using Adobe Photoshop ruler software: Maxillary incisor exposure (MIE) (mm), smile index (SI) (mm), smile arc, buccal corridor ratio (%), Most posterior maxillary tooth visible, anterior height of the smile (%), posterior height of the smile (%). Statistical Analysis: The data were compiled systematically. Statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS version 17. 0). For MIE and SI, Unpaired t-test was applied. Chi-square test was applied for most posterior maxillary tooth visible, smile arc buccal corridor, anterior height of smile, and posterior height of smile. Results: The mean value of MIE was found to be 7. 76 mm and 8. 82 mm in boys and girls, respectively. SI showed a mean value of 8. 26 for boys and 7. 91 for girls. Girls displayed second premolar commonly in contrast to boys, who displayed first premolar. Parallel smile arc was noted more frequently in females, while males displayed flat smile arc commonly. Conclusion: Orthodontists, being smile architects, have the responsibility to design and create smiles. Smile analysis should {{be an integral part of}} dental/orthodontic treatment planning and mechanotherapy...|$|R
