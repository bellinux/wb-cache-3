25|$|On 10 October 2012, Toyota {{issued a}} recall for 2009 model year Corolla and Matrix, along with 10 other models. The recall notices states that {{improperly}} lubricated driver's side <b>power</b> <b>window</b> master switch may develop a “notchy” or sticky feel, and that improper aftermarket lubrication may present a fire hazard. The repair involves lubricating the switch assembly {{with a special}} fluorine grease.|$|E
25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted <b>power</b> <b>window</b> switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated cruise control switch, a recessed trunk pull-down handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E
2500|$|... 2005 was {{the last}} model year for the XG350, {{as it would be}} {{replaced}} {{at the top of the}} Hyundai line-up by the 2006 Azera. Both the base and L models now offered the formerly optional carpeted floor mats as standard equipment, while the L model was now equipped with a standard trunk-mounted eight-disc CD changer. The driver's door switch panel featured a restyled power door lock button; it was now designed to feel less like the adjacent <b>power</b> <b>window</b> controls, for ease of differentiation by touch.|$|E
50|$|The XR4Ti extra-cost options {{initially}} included three-speed automatic transmission, <b>power</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>power</b> door locks, cruise control, leather seats, heated front seats, manual-crank moonroof (retractable, {{tinted glass}} with sunshade), and metallic paint. Typically ordered options such as <b>power</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>power</b> door locks, and cruise control eventually became standard.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Power</b> <b>Windows</b> was remastered {{again in}} 2011 by Andy VanDette for the [...] "Sector" [...] box sets, which re-released all of Rush's Mercury-era albums. <b>Power</b> <b>Windows</b> is {{included}} in the Sector 3 set.|$|R

2500|$|With the Impala {{no longer}} being produced, a new base Caprice four-door model was {{introduced}} (similar to the previous Impala). Still available was a four-door sedan, coupe and eight-passenger station wagon, while a new Brougham four-door sedan joined the model line-up. Brougham models featured a 55/45 front seat with armrest, and a new [...] "pillow design" [...] with velour fabrics. Broughams featured woodgrain appliqué on its dash fascia, a dome map light, front-door courtesy lights and 20oz carpeting. <b>Power</b> <b>window</b> controls for all models moved from the door panel to the armrest for improved ergonomics.|$|E
2500|$|Toyota {{introduced}} a refreshed [...] "regular" [...] Camry XV40 design in January 2009 at the North American International Auto Show. Visual changes include an updated front fascia, including grille and bumper with larger air intakes, larger projector headlamps, redesigned tail lamp lenses incorporating LEDs on all models (previously hybrids only), and revised wheel trims among other design changes. The interior received revised trim, improved <b>power</b> <b>window</b> switches, and a revamped audio system. The audio system now supports satellite radio (in North America) and added USB connectivity, with the dashboard-mounted screen now integrating a backup camera for models fitted with satellite navigation.|$|E
2500|$|The SEL line {{received}} a few upgrades for 2003, {{to give it}} a more upscale image. Among the changes were a new instrument cluster, wheels, as well as a slight redesign of the dash, with woodgrain replacing the black trim. It also got woodgrain on the steering wheel rim and around the <b>power</b> <b>window</b> switches on the front doors. Also in 2003, Ford created a Centennial Edition Taurus to celebrate Ford's 100th anniversary. This special Taurus included many extras, such as lighter wood trim, special leather seats, headlights with black accents, special wheels, a special leather case for the owner's manual, a leather jacket that said [...] "Ford: 100 Years", a similar watch, and a letter from William Clay Ford, Jr. Production was limited to 4,000 units.|$|E
5000|$|Ford {{also had}} a similar {{electro-hydraulic}} system on higher-end convertibles. Mercury and Ford Sportsman convertibles (with wood trim) were equipped with <b>power</b> <b>windows</b> on four windows from 1946 through 1948 and Mercury and Lincoln by 1951. These systems were used by other luxury car models (Imperial and Packard) until Chrysler introduced the all-electric operation on the 1951 Imperial. The availability of <b>power</b> <b>windows</b> increased {{with the use of}} small, high-torque electric motors. General Motors also followed with full electric operation in 1954. This included four-way and then six-way seats, which were introduced in 1956. Chevrolet introduced the oddity of <b>power</b> front <b>windows</b> (only) in the 1954 model. Ford also introduced full four-door <b>power</b> <b>windows</b> in sedans in 1954. The full-sized 1955 Nash [...] "Airflyte" [...] models featured optional <b>power</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R

50|$|Window {{regulators}} - The <b>power</b> <b>window</b> regulator, {{essentially the}} mechanism that transfers {{power from the}} electric motor to the window, has a few plastic parts that can fail after several years causing the <b>power</b> <b>window</b> to stop operating. DIY replacement of a window regulator {{can be done in}} about 1-2 hours at a cost of somewhere between $60 and $120 for the part.|$|E
50|$|The car {{comes in}} three {{different}} trim levels: Standard, Norm and Lux. The Norm level includes power steering, front <b>power</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>power</b> door locks and trip computer, while Lux adds passenger airbag, side airbags, ABS, ESC, rear <b>power</b> <b>windows,</b> air conditioning, heated mirrors, heated front seats, and multimedia system with a 7-inch touchscreen display.|$|R

50|$|Packard {{introduced}} the first <b>power</b> <b>windows</b> in the 1940 Packard 180 series. This was a hydro-electric system. In 1941, the Ford Motor Company followed {{with the first}} <b>power</b> <b>windows</b> on the Lincoln Custom (only the limousine and seven-passenger sedans). Cadillac had a straight-electric divider window (but not side windows) on their series 75.|$|R

50|$|<b>Power</b> <b>windows</b> {{have become}} so common that by 2008, some {{automakers}} eliminated hand crank windows from all their models. So many vehicles now have <b>power</b> <b>windows</b> that some people no longer understand the (formerly) common sign from another driver of using their hand to simulate moving a window crank to indicate that they wish to speak with someone when stopped at a light or in a parking lot. The 2008 Audi RS4 sold in Europe, however, still has roll-up windows for the rear doors although its counterpart sold in the U.S. has <b>power</b> <b>windows</b> for all doors.|$|R
