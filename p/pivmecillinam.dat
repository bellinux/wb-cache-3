Both drugs were administered orally for 5 days. Four patients receiving ampicillin were infected with Shigella strains that were resistant to ampicillin but susceptible to <b>pivmecillinam,</b> and two patients receiving <b>pivmecillinam</b> were infected with Shigella strains resistant to both ampicillin and <b>pivmecillinam.</b> The mean duration of diarrhea in all patients receiving <b>pivmecillinam</b> was 3. 3 days compared with 4. 5 days in patients receiving ampicillin (P less than 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Fluoroquinolones are {{extensively}} used as prophylaxis for transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of {{the prostate}} (TRUBP). Emerging fluoroquinolone resistance and selection of multiresistant organisms warrant new prophylactic strategies. <b>Pivmecillinam</b> and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid have mutual synergistic activity and {{the combination of these}} agents has a broad coverage of the majority of microorganisms causing infectious complications after TRUBP and may be a valuable future prophylactic regimen. Patients and methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of 2624 men that underwent TRUBP at a Danish university hospital. The patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 (n 1220) received ciprofloxacin before TRUBP, Group 2 (n 240) received a combination of <b>pivmecillinam</b> and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid before TRUBP and Group 3 (n 1161) received an extended prophylaxis with <b>pivmecillinam</b> and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid before and for 2 days after TRUBP.

40|$|Mecillinam is a {{new type}} of β-lactam {{antibiotic}} (an amidinopenicillanic acid) that is particularly active against Enterobacteriaceae and is taken orally as {{in the form of an}} ester, <b>pivmecillinam.</b> Assessment of any new antibiotic should include a survey of levels of bacterial resistance and investigation of its capacity to select resistant organisms or harm the commensal flora.

Mecillinam-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were found to be much less common than ampicillin-amoxycillin-resistant organisms both in the community and in hospital patients. Most ampicillin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae from infected urines were susceptible to mecillinam, but the relatively rare mecillinam-resistant organisms were usually resistant to ampicillin and cephaloridine. The fecal flora of 26 healthy volunteers who served as controls or were given repeated courses of therapeutic doses of either ampicillin or <b>pivmecillinam</b> was studied. <b>Pivmecillinam</b> had only a transient effect on the aerobic fecal flora and in contrast to ampicillin did not increase populations of resistant Enterobacteriaceae, which would be a potential hazard to the patient and contaminate the environment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) -producing Enterobacteriaceae is increasing and the therapeutic options are limited, especially in primary care. Recent indications have suggested <b>pivmecillinam</b> to be a suitable option. This pilot study aimed {{to assess the}} viability of <b>pivmecillinam</b> as a therapeutic option in a Dublin cohort ﻿of mixed community and healthcare origin﻿. Methods A prospective measurement of mean and fractional inhibitory concentrations of antibiotic use in 95 patients diagnosed with UTI caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was carried out. 36  % patients were from general practice, 40  % were admitted to hospital within south Dublin, and 25  % samples arose from nursing homes. EUCAST breakpoints {{were used to determine}} if an isolate was sensitive or resistant to antibiotic agents. Results Sixty-nine percent of patients (N[*]=[*] 66) with urinary ESBL isolates were female. The mean age of females was 66  years compared {{with a mean age of}} 74  years for males. Thirty-six percent of isolates originated from primary care, hospital inpatients (26  %), and nursing homes (24  %). The vast majority of ESBL isolates were E. coli (80  %). The E tests for mecillinam and co-amoxiclav had concentration ranges from 0. 16  mg/L up to 256  mg/L. The mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) of mecillinam ranged from 0. 25 to 256  mg/L, while co-amoxiclav MICs ranged from 6 to 256  mg/L. The percentage of isolates resistant to mecillinam and co-amoxiclav was found to be 5. 26 and 94. 74  % respectively. Conclusions This is the first study exploring the use of <b>pivmecillinam</b> in an Irish cohort and has demonstrated that its use in conjunction with or without co-amoxiclav is an appropriate and useful treatment for urinary tract infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms...|$|E

40|$|The {{knowledge}} {{of the effects of}} antimicrobial agents on the normal vaginal microflora is limited. The objective {{of the present study was}} to study the ecological impact of <b>pivmecillinam</b> on the normal vaginal microflora. In 20 healthy women, the estimated day of ovulation was determined during three subsequent menstrual cycles. Microbiological and clinical examinations were performed on the estimated day of ovulation and on day 3 in all cycles and also on day 7 after ovulation in cycles 1 and 2. Anaerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-positive rods, mainly species of lactobacilli and actinomycetes, dominated the microflora. One woman was colonized on the third day of administration with a resistant Escherichia coli strain, and Candida albicans was detected in one woman on days 3 and 7 in cycle 2. No other major changes in the normal microflora occurred during the study. Administration of <b>pivmecillinam</b> had a minor ecological impact on the normal vaginal microflora. The vaginal microflora is influenced by a number of endog-enous and exogenous factors (10).

In the <b>pivmecillinam</b> treatment group PFGE showed that among patients having a negative urine culture at the first follow-up 77 % (46 / 60) had a relapse with the primary infecting E. coli strain and 23 % (14 / 60) had reinfection with a new E. coli strain at the second follow-up. Among patients having E. coli at the first follow-up PFGE showed that 80 % (32 / 40) had persistence with the primary infecting E. coli strain, 15 % (6 / 40) had reinfection with a new E. coli strain, and 5 % (2 / 40) had different E. coli strains at the two follow-up visits (one had reinfection followed by relapse, and the other had persistence followed by reinfection).

Given its benign nature, acute uncomplicated cystitis (AUC) is an ideal target of action. Rapid urine test (RUT) for detection of nitrites and leucocytes have a high negative predictive value, so that some guidelines on AUC recommend their systematic use, such as the French [1], the Scottish [2] and that of the European Association of Urology [3]. Of note, diagnostic procedures are not ad-dressed by the current IDSA and ESCMID guidelines [1, 4].

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We selected 100 ESBL-Ec in which ESBLs were identified by PCR and sequencing, between 2009 and 2010. We determined the MICs of amoxicillin-clavulanate, piperacillin-tazobactam, temocillin, mecillinam, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, tigecycline, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin using reference methods. The susceptibility profiles were defined according to EUCAST 2012 recommendations.
