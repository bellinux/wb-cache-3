5000|$|Accessory {{equipment}} to power auxiliary {{equipment such as}} <b>power</b> <b>brakes</b> and heating system ...|$|R
50|$|Little {{changed in}} 1952. <b>Power</b> <b>brakes</b> were {{standard}} on the Windsor DeLuxe 8-passenger sedan.|$|R
50|$|The front {{underhood}} compartment {{contains the}} charger, an electric air conditioner, the power steering mechanism, the <b>power</b> <b>brake</b> unit (otherwise conventional), a radiator {{for the air}} conditioner, and a vacuum pump and reservoir for the <b>power</b> <b>brakes</b> and a reservoir for the windshield washer. Charger and battery liquid cooling service is performed here but is not an owner-operator service item.|$|R
5000|$|Front {{disc brakes}} and rear drum <b>brakes.</b> ABS <b>Power</b> <b>brakes</b> with {{electric}} pump w/ regenerative braking.|$|R
5000|$|The cars also {{featured}} a curved windshield, replacing the two piece windshield used on previous models. Passenger compartment heater, electric clock, <b>power</b> <b>brakes,</b> <b>power</b> steering and white sidewall tires were all available as options.|$|R
25|$|To {{address the}} issue, GM said dealers will replace a {{micro-switch}} in the <b>power</b> <b>brake</b> vacuum pipe assembly.|$|R

5000|$|... 1972: Final year of {{production}} (in North America). Minor detail changes and <b>power</b> <b>brakes</b> become a new option on upper level trim options.|$|R
50|$|In 1966 the car got <b>power</b> <b>brakes,</b> {{while in}} 1967 other changes were added: {{for example the}} windshield's height was {{enlarged}} by 66 mm.|$|R
50|$|Variable-ratio power {{steering}} {{was a new}} option this year and front disc brakes were now automatically included when the <b>power</b> <b>brake</b> option was ordered.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{equipment}} {{included the}} Starfire's 345 hp (257 kW) 394 cubic-inch Rocket V8 engine, but lacked its automatic transmission, <b>power</b> steering, <b>power</b> <b>brakes,</b> leather interior, and distinctive brightwork trim. Included were bucket seats, center console, carpeting, full wheel covers, and padded instrument panel. A three-speed column-shift manual transmission was standard, with a three-speed Roto Hydra-matic automatic with console-mounted T-handle shifter optional. Adding just automatic transmission, power steering, and <b>power</b> <b>brakes</b> brought the 4028 lb Jetstar I's price close to $4,000.|$|R
50|$|Beyond {{the unusual}} power train (batteries, {{controller}} and motor), the remaining {{systems in the}} RAV4 EV are comparable to the gasoline-powered RAV4. The <b>power</b> <b>brakes,</b> <b>power</b> steering, tire wear and suspension components are similar except that they use electric power sources. The <b>power</b> <b>brakes</b> use an electric pump to provide vacuum instead of deriving vacuum from the engine manifold. The power steering use an electric motor instead of mechanical energy delivered by fan belts. The passenger compartment is heated and cooled electrically using a heat pump (the first fleet application of a heat pump in a road vehicle) with supplemental electrical resistance heating as backup.|$|R
50|$|The Series III {{included}} larger <b>power</b> <b>brakes</b> and {{a larger}} rear window. This design was also available, rebadged, as Riley's Pathfinder replacement, the ill-fated Two-Point-Six. 5052 were made.|$|R
5000|$|A new {{overhead}} cam Jeep Tornado engine 230 CID L straight-six producing [...] was standard. Innovations for four-wheel-drive pickups included optional automatic transmission (an industry first), {{as well as}} <b>power</b> <b>brakes,</b> <b>power</b> steering, and a Power Take-Off unit for numerous accessories that included snow plows and push plates.|$|R
2500|$|... strengtheing piston conrod {{crankshaft}} and crankmetal manual transmission, and <b>power</b> <b>brakes.</b> Both the B and A used front {{disc brakes}} with dual pistons and alloy finned drums in the rear.|$|R
50|$|A Vacuum Servo {{also known}} as a power booster or <b>power</b> <b>brake</b> unit uses a vacuum to {{multiply}} the drivers pedal effort and apply that effort to the master cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{standard}} axle [...] "bogies" [...] provide the drive mechanism. Each bogie {{is driven by}} 3-phase alternating current (AC) motor. A third rail provides <b>power.</b> <b>Braking</b> is either regenerative (returning electricity to the grid) with supplemental disc and (emergency) mechanical <b>braking.</b> <b>Power</b> is delivered to the vehicles using brushes or by current carrying wheels.|$|R
50|$|In October 2010, the Phantom was {{included}} in a recall involving cars with a V8 or V12 engine from BMW, {{because of the potential}} to develop a leak in the <b>power</b> <b>braking</b> system.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Freeway (designated ADO40) {{was replaced}} by the Freeway Mk II (YDO3) [...] in October 1964. The revised model featured a more powerful engine, <b>power</b> <b>brakes,</b> improved rear suspension and improved seating.|$|R
50|$|A burnout (also {{known as}} a peel out or <b>power</b> <b>brake)</b> is the {{practice}} of keeping a vehicle stationary and spinning its wheels, causing the tires to heat up and smoke due to friction.|$|R
50|$|Licences for Hispano-Suiza patents {{were much}} in demand from {{prestige}} car manufacturers world-wide. Rolls-Royce used {{a number of}} Hispano-Suiza patents. For instance, for many years Rolls Royce installed Hispano-Suiza designed <b>power</b> <b>brakes</b> in its vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The most {{ubiquitous}} vacuum-powered accessory is the booster for the <b>power</b> <b>brake</b> system. The vacuum is only {{an assist}} and the brakes can still function, requiring greater force, if the booster vacuum is used up.|$|R
5000|$|The 300b (W186) was {{introduced}} in March 1954, adding vacuum assisted <b>power</b> <b>brakes</b> and front door vent windows. Engine power was upped to [...] via different Solex carburetors and an increased compression ratio of 7.5:1.|$|R
5000|$|The {{two leading}} United States Supreme Court cases {{on the reverse}} {{doctrine}} of equivalents are Westinghouse v. Boyden <b>Power</b> <b>Brake</b> Co., and [...] Graver Tank & Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Linde Air Prods. Co., Inc., ...|$|R
50|$|Typically, MSV's {{came with}} dual climate controls, power windows, power door locks, <b>power</b> <b>brakes,</b> <b>power</b> steering, heated power mirrors, cruise control, a reverse camera, and a Street Pilot GPS. A myriad of other {{creature}} comforts could be added, including limo-style seating, microwave ovens, coffee-makers, {{and even a}} full marine-style bathroom. Quite a few also had satellite TV domes, moon-roofs and onboard generators.|$|R
50|$|Mechanically, <b>power</b> <b>brakes</b> and <b>power</b> {{steering}} {{became an}} option in 1954. In 1954, the overhead-valve Y-block V8 replaced the Flathead V8 seen since 1932. At 130 hp, the Y-block produced twice the horsepower {{as the original}} 1932 V8.|$|R
50|$|Brake force, {{also known}} as <b>Brake</b> <b>Power,</b> {{is a measure of}} <b>braking</b> <b>power</b> of a vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|The 1956 Fireflite had {{a longer}} stroke, 3.80 inches, giving a 330 cubic inch displacement. Compression ratio {{increased}} to 8.5:1 and power increased to [...] It made up 27.39% of DeSoto's sales in 1956. Power seats were $70, while <b>power</b> <b>brakes</b> $40.|$|R
5000|$|A CCCA Classic is a [...] "fine" [...] or [...] "distinctive" [...] automobile, either American {{or foreign}} built, {{produced}} between 1915 and 1948. Generally, a Classic was high-priced when new and {{was built in}} limited quantities. Other factors, including engine displacement, custom coachwork and luxury accessories, such as <b>power</b> <b>brakes,</b> <b>power</b> clutch, and [...] "one-shot" [...] or automatic lubrication systems, help determine whether a car {{is considered to be}} a Classic.|$|R
50|$|The B model {{featured}} three Weber 40DCOE-18 carburetors, {{a limited}} slip differential, five-speed close ratio strengtheing piston conrod crankshaft and crankmetal manual transmission, and <b>power</b> <b>brakes.</b> Both the B and A used front disc brakes with dual pistons and alloy finned drums in the rear.|$|R
5000|$|Also in 1954, <b>power</b> <b>brakes.</b> [...] "power lift" [...] windows (only for {{the front}} passenger, and driver doors), as well as {{air-conditioning}} were offered as extra cost options for the first time. In addition, a far more responsive, and fully adjustable front seat was added.|$|R
50|$|In {{automotive}} applications, a {{clogged filter}} in a hydraulic system (<b>power</b> steering, <b>power</b> <b>brakes)</b> can cause suction cavitation making a noise that {{rises and falls}} in synch with engine RPM. It is fairly often a high pitched whine, like set of nylon gears not quite meshing correctly.|$|R
