50|$|Identity-based {{conditional}} proxy re-encryption (IBCPRE) {{is a type}} of proxy re-encryption (PRE) {{scheme in}} the identity-based <b>public</b> <b>key</b> <b>cryptographic</b> setting. An IBCPRE scheme is a natural extension of proxy re-encryption on two aspects. The first aspect is to extend the proxy re-encryption notion to the identity-based <b>public</b> <b>key</b> <b>cryptographic</b> setting. The second aspect is to extend the feature set of proxy re-encryption to support conditional proxy re-encryption. By conditional proxy re-encryption, a proxy can use an IBCPRE scheme to re-encrypt a ciphertext but the ciphertext would only be well-formed for decryption if a condition applied onto the ciphertext together with the re-encryption key is satisfied. This allows fine-grained proxy re-encryption and can be useful for applications such as secure sharing over encrypted cloud data storage.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} {{that it is possible to}} perform <b>public</b> <b>key</b> <b>cryptographic</b> operations on the resourceconstrained sensor platforms. However, the significant resource consumption imposed by <b>public</b> <b>key</b> <b>cryptographic</b> operations makes such mechanisms easy targets of Denialof-Service (DoS) attacks. For example, if digital signatures such as ECDSA are used directly for broadcast authentication without further protection, an attacker can simply broadcast forged packets and force the receiving nodes to perform a large number of unnecessary signature verifications, eventually exhausting their battery power. This paper studies how to deal with such DoS attacks when signatures are used for broadcast authentication in sensor networks. In particular, this paper presents two filtering techniques, a group-based filter and a key chain-based filter, to handle DoS attacks against signature verification. Both methods can significantly reduce the number of unnecessary signature verifications that a sensor node has to perform. The analytical results also show that these two techniques are efficient and effective for resource-constrained sensor networks...|$|R
40|$|In many {{business}} sectors secure and efficient data transfer is essential. To ensure the {{security to the}} applications of business, the business sectors use <b>Public</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Cryptographic</b> Systems (PKCS). An RSA and NTRU system generally belongs to the category of PKCS. The efficiency of a <b>public</b> <b>key</b> <b>cryptographic</b> system is mainly measured in computational overheads, key size and bandwidth. In particular, the RSA algorithm is used in many applications. Although the security of RSA is beyond doubt, the evolution in computing power has caused a growth in the necessary key length. The fact that most chips on smart cards cannot process keys extending 1024 bit shows {{that there is a}} need for alternative. NTRU is such an alternative and it is a collection of mathematical algorithms based on manipulating lists of very small integers and polynomials. This allows NTRU to achieve high speeds with the use of minimal computing power. NTRU is the first secure public key cryptosystem not based on factorization or discrete logarithm problems. This means that given sufficient computational resources and time, an adversary, should not be able to break the key. The performance characteristics of NTRU and RSA are observed by implementing the algorithms for computation and comparing their experimental running times. Encryption and decryption speeds take O (n log (n)) operations. The RSA’s complexity is O (n 3) operations and it compares with NTRU’s O (n log(n) operations.

40|$|Abstract. As sensor {{networks}} {{continue to}} become one of the key technologies to realize ubiquitous computing, promising to revolutionize our ability to sense and control the physical environment, security remains a growing concern. The resource-constrained characteristics of sensor nodes, the ad-hoc nature of their deployment, and the vulnerability of wireless communications in general pose a need for unique solutions. A fundamental requisite for achieving security is the ability to encrypt and decrypt con…dential data among arbitrary sensor nodes, necessitating the generation of joint private keys. Although the advantage of <b>public</b> <b>key</b> <b>cryptographic</b> key-generation is widely acknowledged, o¤ering scalability and decentralized management, the scarce resources of sensor networks render the applicability of public key methodologies highly challenging. In this respect, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) has emerged as a suitable <b>public</b> <b>key</b> <b>cryptographic</b> foundation in constrained environments, providing high security for relatively small key sizes. Recent results indicate that the execution of ECC operations in sensor nodes is feasible. In an e¤ort to promote practical adoption of ECC-based key-generation in sensor networks, this paper presents a comprehensive security methodology that signi…cantly reduces the overall communication and computation e¤orts involved.
