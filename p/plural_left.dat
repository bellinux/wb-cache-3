40|$|The {{experiments}} in this dissertation investigate {{factors that influence}} the level of detail within plural mental representations. The first chapter focuses on properties of noun phrases and event structure that allow comprehenders to create a highly specified plural mental representation (i. e., a representation in which the individuals {{that make up a}} plural are represented distinctly) from a previously underspecified plural mental representation. The second chapter in this dissertation focuses on properties of the sentential context that influence comprehenders' mental representations of plural predicates. In contrast to traditional theories of plural mental representations, which have argued that <b>plurals</b> are <b>left</b> underspecified during comprehension (Johnson-Laird, 1983), these data indicate that oftentimes <b>plurals</b> are not <b>left</b> underspecified, but have highly specified mental representations. The {{experiments in}} this dissertation show that syntactic, semantic and pragmatic factors influence the degree of specification of plural mental representations. These findings have important consequences for theories of underspecification and theories of mental representations during sentence comprehension...|$|R
2500|$|Anti-neoliberalism and Disarray of left-wing parties – During the 2002 presidential elections, {{a number}} of left-wing {{candidates}} ran for office, which, according to commentators, was {{one reason for the}} defeat of Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin. Jospin blamed in particular Jean-Pierre Chevènement's candidacy, as well as Christiane Taubira's one. However, others commentators have criticised Jospin's attitude and the policies of the PS, which account, according to them, for the low score of Jospin. Inheritor of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), the PS is historically social-democrat, while the French Communist Party (PCF) is a governmental party, which participated in Jospin's Gauche plurielle (<b>Plural</b> <b>Lefts)</b> government (with ministers such as Jean-Claude Gayssot, etc.). In this sense, the PCF does not consider itself a far-left party, to the contrary of the Revolutionary Communist League (LCR) or Workers' Struggle (LO). But the PCF does consider itself part of the [...] "anti-liberal" [...] coalition, which opposed the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe (TCE). Inside the French Socialist Party (PS, Parti socialiste) itself, Laurent Fabius headed the minority who opposed the treaty. However, the victory of the [...] "No" [...] during the May 2005 referendum on the TCE hasn't been exploited yet by the left parties or organisations which supported it. The main topic of the non-PS left-wings was to try to choose a single candidate for the [...] "anti-liberal" [...] Left, which opposes neo-liberalism. This eventually failed, and the far-left was represented by four competing candidates, Marie-George Buffet, Olivier Besancenot, José Bové and Arlette Laguiller. [...] " ...|$|R
