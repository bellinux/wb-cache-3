500|$|Designer Milton Knight {{recalled}} that [...] "audiences actually wanted a wilder, raunchier Cool World. The premiere audience I saw it with certainly did." [...] The critical {{reaction to the}} film was generally negative. Roger Ebert wrote, [...] "The DJ who was hosting the radio station's free preview of Cool World leaped onto the stage and promised the audience: 'If you liked Roger Rabbit, you'll love Cool World!' He was wrong, but you can't blame him—he hadn't seen the movie. I have, and I will now <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> if you liked Roger Rabbit, quit while you're ahead." [...] The film was a box-office disappointment. While other film projects followed, Bakshi began to focus more attention on painting.|$|E
500|$|Asked if {{he thought}} Bowyer could still win the {{championship}} after this setback, Stewart argued, [...] "It's possible for sure. The biggest {{thing is going to}} be going to the race track and having that stress of not having his crew chief, not having his car chief and those are two key people on a race weekend... I can <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> Childress has the resources to cover this... it's definitely possible, but everyone else {{is going to have to}} have trouble." [...] Bowyer did not lose the victory title for the race itself; NASCAR vice president of competition Robin Pemberton commented, [...] "We don't consider taking away the win. If you ask some, they would consider a 150-point penalty with only nine races to go in the Chase a pretty hefty penalty." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Italy and Switzerland participated for {{the first}} time. The Italian team, at the time ranked 17th in the world, had {{qualified}} because Italy was the host nation. They were outscored 32–1 in three games and IIHF president René Fasel declared his intention to make future tournaments more competitive and not allow host nations to automatically qualify. The Canadian team started the tournament by outscoring opponents 36–1 over three games. American defenceman Angela Ruggiero accused the team of running up the score and warned that the event's Olympic status could be called into question due to a perceived lack of competitive teams. In response, René Fasel stated that other women's teams were improving {{and that there was}} similar dominance {{in the early years of}} the men's tournament but the sport continued to grow. He added, [...] "I <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> it won't take the [...] women 64 years to win"—in reference to the Swedish men's team inability to defeat Canada in Olympic play until 1984 (the Swedish women's team defeated Canada {{for the first}} time at the 2008 4 Nations Cup).|$|E
500|$|The Ionians did however hold {{meetings}} {{to discuss the}} conduct of the battle. Dionysius, the Phocaean general, offered to train and lead the Greek force: [...] "Our affairs, men of Ionia, stand {{on the edge of a}} razor, whether to be free men or slaves, and runaway slaves at that. If you now consent to endure hardships, you will have toil for the present time, but it will be in your power to overcome your enemies and gain freedom; but if you will be weak and disorderly, I see nothing that can save you from paying the penalty to the king for your rebellion. Believe me and entrust yourselves to me; I <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> (if the gods deal fairly with us) either our enemies shall not meet us in battle, or if they do they shall be utterly vanquished." [...] Dionysius thus began an intensive training program, leading the fleet out every day to train the rowers in ramming manoeuvers, and the marines in combat. For seven days the Ionians accepted this regime, but being unused to the hard work, they refused to obey thereafter, and stayed in camp instead. According to Herodotus, upon seeing the resultant discontent and division in the Ionian camp, the Samians decided to accept the Persian offer of lenience in return for desertion. However, some modern historians reject the notion of dissent in the Greek camp. Herodotus derived his account of Lade from the Samians themselves, and it is suggested that, seeking to excuse their treachery, they came up with this story. At any rate, the Samians remained with the other Greeks in the run up to the battle.|$|E
500|$|The WWF {{received}} some support {{from people who}} felt that the company {{did the right thing}} by continuing the event. Vince Russo, a WWF script writer at the time, pointed to the fact that Brian Pillman, a family friend of the Harts and a member of The Hart Foundation, died shortly before the [...] pay-per-view on which he was scheduled to perform in 1997. After learning of Pillman's death, both Bret and Owen Hart went ahead with their matches on the show. Russo claimed that this showed that [...] "the night he passed away I'm sure Owen would have wanted the same thing." [...] Vince McMahon refused to comment on Hart's death until he felt sufficient time had passed. When asked if he felt responsible for the accident, he replied, [...] "I have a lot to say and I will say it. I <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> <b>that.</b> But {{this is not the time}} to do it.... Give me a few days. Give me to the end of the week. Then we'll talk." [...] The day after Over the Edge, the WWF published a message in the Calgary Sun, stating, [...] "We do not have much information as to how it happened and will not know until an investigation is completed. We are all shaken, and to say Owen will be missed is to fall short of a way to fully explain what he meant to us." [...] Although the WWF had no information, they reported that [...] "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Hart family. We have to be strong for Owen; he was an extraordinary human being and consummate performer and knows that the highest tribute that we can pay is to go on entertaining the fans he loved so much." ...|$|E

I <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{if you look at}} it from outside, and perhaps you're taking rather a parochial view at the moment, I don't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos." [...] This reply was reported in The Sun under the headline [...] "Crisis? What Crisis?". Callaghan also later admitted in regard to the Winter of Discontent that he had [...] "let the country down".|$|E
2500|$|After the event, {{president}} Asif Ali Zardari {{appealed for}} [...] "all democratic forces" [...] {{to help to}} save Pakistan and he pledged to rid Pakistan of Islamic militants: [...] "Terrorism is a cancer in Pakistan, we are determined, God willing, we will rid the country of this cancer. I <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> such actions by these cowards will not lower our resolve." [...] Pakistan's chief adviser on internal security, Rehman Malik, said [...] "the authorities would fight on until the last terrorist is cleared. We think that the safe Pakistan, safe Afghanistan is safety for the world and therefore we will not let them have easy way." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the film, Hugo and his {{grandfather}} were supposed to [...] "travel to a diamond moon" [...] and the storyboards showed Hugo battling Scylla in space. The plot premise was described by Helbrandt as following: [...] "Afskyelia [...] have obtained a way to threaten Hugo and his forest friends. Therefore Hugo has to do something, and when he discovers a moon behind the moon we know today, he will set forth. Afskyelia chases after him. But I <b>promise</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> unfortunately for her, the story is to end happily." [...] The movie's basic plot premise resembles the educational game Hugo in Space, which was released in 2003, {{one year after the}} planned release of the movie. In this game, she plans to extract the rare magical black diamonds (first introduced in an action game [...] in 2002) from an asteroid's core and become the most powerful witch of all time.|$|E

2500|$|By then, Romanian {{intervention}} posed {{a fundamental}} dilemma, since {{the political class}} became undecided about whether to cement Bessarabian statehood or {{look forward to a}} union. Inconclusiveness touched the Bessarabian army. Its new uniforms, on the Romanian model, led Bessarabians to assume that it was a branch of the Romanian Land Forces; the monogram R.M., for Republica Moldovenească ("Moldavian Republic"), was commonly misread as standing for [...] "Greater Romania" [...] (România Mare). Pântea himself appeared undecided about the situation, and, in a letter to pro-Russian officer Anatol Popa (later sentenced to death by the Romanian military), argued: [...] "I <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I'll be defending republican Bessarabia next to Russia, even if it costs me my life [...] I gave the order for all the Moldavian army to take action; when {{it turned out that the}} Romanians were arriving with too great a force, I changed that order. The Romanians hold on tight [...] I fear greatly that the Romanians are here to steal away our Bessarabia." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2010, Gaga {{disclosed}} {{that she was}} working on a new album, saying that she had written most of the songs for the proposed album. Meanwhile, producer RedOne described it as Gaga's [...] "freedom album" [...] as her manager, Troy Carter, felt her public image would begin to change after the release of Born This Way. A few months after the announcement, Gaga exclaimed that she had finished writing songs for the album: [...] "It came so quickly. I've been working on it for months, and I feel very strongly that it's finished right now. Some artists take years. I don't. I write music every day." [...] In another interview, she declared the album [...] "the anthem of [...] generation," [...] as she continued, [...] "It includes the greatest music I've ever written. I've already written the first single for the new album and I <b>promise</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> this album is the greatest of my career." ...|$|E
2500|$|Burton next {{featured}} as Jimmy Porter, [...] "an angry young man" [...] role, in {{the film}} version of John Osborne's play Look Back in Anger (1959), a gritty drama about middle-class life in the British Midlands, directed by Tony Richardson, again with Claire Bloom as co-star. Biographer Bragg observed that Look Back in Anger [...] "had defined a generation, provided a watershed in Britain's view of itself and brought [...] into the public prints as a controversial, dangerous figure". Burton was able to identify himself with Porter, finding it [...] "fascinating to find a man who came presumably from my sort of class, who actually could talk the way I would like to talk". The film, and Burton's performance, received mixed reviews upon release. [...] Biographer Alpert noted that though reviews in the UK were favourable, those in the United States were more negative. Crowther wrote of Burton: [...] "His tirades are eloquent but tiring, his breast beatings are dramatic but dull and his occasional lapses into sadness are pathetic but endurable." [...] Both Geoff Andrew of Time Out magazine and Schwartz felt Burton was too old for the part, and the Variety reviewer thought [...] "the role gives him little opportunity for variety". Contemporary reviews of the film have been better and it has a rating of 89% on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. Look Back in Anger is now considered one of the defining films of the British New Wave cinema, a movement from the late 1950s to the late 1960s in which working-class characters became the focus of the film and conflict of social classes a central theme. Jimmy Porter is also considered as one of Burton's best on-screen roles; he was nominated in the Best Actor categories at the BAFTA and Golden Globe Awards but lost to Peter Sellers for I'm All Right Jack (1959) and Anthony Franciosa for Career (1959) respectively. Though it didn't do well commercially, Burton was proud of the effort and wrote to Philip, [...] "I <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> there isn't a shred of self-pity in my performance. I am {{for the first time ever}} looking forward to seeing a film in which I play." [...] While filming Look Back in Anger, Burton did another play for BBC Radio, participating in two versions, one in Welsh and another in English, of Welsh poet Saunders Lewis' Brad, which was about the 20 July plot. Burton voiced one of the conspirators, Caesar von Hofacker.|$|E
