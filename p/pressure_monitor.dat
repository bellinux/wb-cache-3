40|$|Blood {{pressure}} measurement {{in the diagnosis}} and management of hypertension, including the technique required for ambulatory blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitoring</b> and home blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitoring,</b> will be reviewed in this article. Home and ambulatory measurements are widely used, both to confirm the diagnosis and to improve adherence to therapy. The major advantage of out-of-office blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitoring</b> is that it provides {{a large number of}} blood {{pressure measurement}}s away from the medical environment, which represents a more reliable assessment of actual blood pressure than office blood pressure. The advantage of ambulatory blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitoring</b> is its unique ability to measure nocturnal blood pressure. Although not fully validated in large-scale clinical trials, ambulatory blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitoring</b> appears to correlate best with prognosis. Ambulatory blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitoring</b> and home blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitoring</b> provide somewhat different information on the subject’s blood pressure status, and the two methods should thus be regarded as complementary, rather than competitive or alternative...|$|R

5000|$|Microlife's blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitors</b> and the {{technologies}} they house {{have been the}} subject of numerous studies and have been validated for both clinical and home use. One of Microlife's technologies is the atrial fibrillation detection incorporated into their blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitors.</b> Their WatchBP Home A device was recommended by the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013. WatchBP Home A was recommended to be used for hypertension monitoring and atrial fibrillation screening in primary care, using the device in primary care could increase the detection rate of atrial fibrillation compared with taking the pulse by hand. Microlife also patented the [...] "Microlife Average Mode" [...] (MAM), which is a feature in the blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitors</b> that takes three consecutive readings and creates an average from that data. Pulse arrhythmia detection (PAD), which is another feature in some Microlife blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitors</b> that automatically detects irregular heartbeats, is another one of the company's primary technologies. Over their lifespan and their different iterations, Microlife blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitors</b> have been validated by the British Hypertension Society with their highest rating (AA).|$|R
