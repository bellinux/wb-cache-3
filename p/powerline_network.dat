The {{objective of the}} project is to investigate how computer vision technology {{can be used to}} meet and exceed the performance of human pilots in detecting potential aircraft collisions, thereby improving the safety of the world’s aviation fleets. enhanced Flight Assist System (eFAS) for Automated Aerial Survey of Powerline Networks The objective of this project was the development of flight-path planning and aircraft guidance and control technology to suit the unique features of the consistent-sensing low-altitude trajectory-constrained aerial inspection problem. This problem is defined by the airborne collection of spatial information that is related to approximately linear power-line [...] "feeder"-type infrastructure. Working with the CRC for Spatial Information and Ergon Energy, previous research had already demonstrated the essential importance of basic automation technologies in such large-scale inspection tasks. The specific objective of this project was the development of additional automation mechanisms that improve inspection efficiency, operational flexibility, and operational reliability so that high quality spatial information can be delivered in a timely and cost effective manner. The potential benefits of advanced 3D planning and flight control for the <b>powerline</b> <b>network</b> inspection activity include reduced pilot workload in both horizontal and vertical control of the aircraft, by maintaining safe horizontal and vertical separation from terrain/obstacles, and positioning the aircraft at the correct altitude, speed and orientation for effective data capture.|$|E

Flight Assist System The Flight Assist System (FAS) is a demonstrator project assisting Ergon Energy in development of the research outcome of a three-year CRC-SI project which focused on business improvement applications for Ergon Energy. The outcome of the CRC-SI project was a proposal for an advanced airborne vegetation management system that would save AUD$14 million per year. To commercialise the research outcomes, Ergon decided to launch the Remote Observation, Automated Modelling & Economic Simulation (ROAMES) project of which FAS is an essential component. ROAMES has since been divested to Fugro Spatial Solutions. Smart Skies Project The Smart Skies Project is a leading edge research program exploring {{the research and development}} of future technologies that support the efficient utilisation of airspace by both manned and unmanned aircraft. It focused upon the exploration and development of three key enabling aviation technologies - an automated separation management system capable of providing separation assurance in complex airspace environments; sense-and-act systems for manned and unmanned aircraft capable of collision avoidance of dynamic and static obstacles; and a mobile aircraft tracking system utilising a cost-effective radar and dependent surveillance systems. Airborne Powerline Inspection Technology Improvements The three year CRC-SI project 6.07 for Spatial information Business improvement applications at Ergon Energy focussed on precision guidance of aircraft over powerlines, asset and vegetation detection using LiDAR imagery, and detection and classification of tree species. The project was successfully completed in 2010 and provided the fundamental basis for the FAS project.

Flying Spore Trap This project and associated research aimed to determine the potential of using an unmanned aerial vehicle, fitted with a spore trap, to detect and monitor spores of plant pathogens for a biosecure Australia. The objective was to develop a sampling system that would have the ability to spatially monitor fungal spores, and protocols to interpret their spatial distribution. This tool will greatly enhance the ability to detect new incursions of fungal pathogens and to enable more accurate delimiting of distribution. The technology will allow for earlier detection of harmful plant pest or disease incursions in difficult areas and provide efficient and effective airborne surveillance.|$|E

40|$|The Cape Griffon Gyps coprotheres {{is listed}} as a {{globally}} threatened species, because of threats posed by, inter alia, poisoning, loss of habitat, food shortages, electrocutions and drowning in high-walled farm reservoirs. The Cape Griffon has undergone major decline in South Africa, including the Eastern Cape. A detailed investigation into the causes of this decline is vital to ensure {{the survival of the}} species. Since it is known that electrocution on powerlines is a major cause of mortality of the griffons in the Eastern Cape, the study therefore focuses on this factor in this region. More specifically, the overall aim or objective of the study is to investigate, through the application of appropriate GIS techniques, the use of descriptive, empirical, habitat and foraging models to prioritise <b>powerline</b> <b>networks,</b> in the Eastern Cape, for mitigation to prevent electrocution of Cape Griffons Gyps coprotheres. The specific activities associated with the aim of the study are: (1) to identify the broad habitat types used by the griffons, (2) to determine the mean daily foraging range size of the griffons, (3) to map currently active foraging ranges and to categorise them according to their role, and the level of importance, in the foraging and breeding behaviour of the species, (4) to map the locations of <b>networks</b> of griffon-unfriendly <b>powerline</b> <b>networks,</b> and (5) to integrate the outcomes of (1) to (4) above, to produce a spatially explicit product that ranks griffon-unfriendly <b>powerline</b> <b>networks</b> according to their priority level for mitigation. The study uses simple descriptive models to investigate, spatially, the threat posed by griffon-unfriendly powerlines to the Cape Griffon in the Eastern Cape. The modelling approach includes a broad level simple habitat model (Categorical model), a Maxent model, a spatial foraging model and an electrocution model. Several map outputs were produced from the analyses. Cape Griffon habitat was successfully modelled using ecological input variables: biome, vegetation xvii type (suitable/unsuitable for griffon foraging), stock (cattle, sheep and goats), and stock farming types (commercial & communal). All outputs were modelled {{through the use of a}} Geographical Information System (GIS). Opportunistic sightings data were used for the study, which means that the data were collected on a non-systematic basis and are therefore considered incomplete. In ecology and zoogeography, incomplete datasets are common. To address this issue, a maximum entropy (Maxent) model was applied to the available dataset. Maxent produces predictions or conclusions from incomplete information, and was therefore useful for this study. The mean daily foraging area (coverage) of the Cape Griffon in the study area was estimated from published and unpublished marked bird studies conducted elsewhere, but in generally similar habitats. Based on all the data from these studies, it was considered appropriate to use a circular area, with a radius of 40 km, to represent the mean daily foraging range of the Cape Griffon in the Eastern Cape. It was considered appropriate to use a roughly circular area to depict the daily foraging area, given that the Cape Griffon qualifies as a central place forager. This means that the griffons are tied to a permanent site (roosting site or breeding site) and forage within a certain area around that central site. The mean daily foraging area (40 km) was applied to the currently active griffon sites: breeding sites, regular roosting sites, seasonal/occasional sites, and roosting sites (uncertain status). This produced four foraging area types, which formed the basis for the creation of two spatial foraging area models: Hierarchical Foraging Area Model (HFAM) and the Intersecting Foraging Area Model (IFAM). The HFAM produced three outputs: Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Foraging Areas. These three areas represent the hierarchical presentation of the relative importance of the four foraging area types. The outcome was areas of different predicted griffon occurrence: ‘high’, ‘medium’, ‘low’. The IFAM is essentially an extension of the HFAM, which represents a single area where foraging ranges based on all four types are intersected. The outcome represents the area of predicted highest griffon occurrence. The identified areas of different predicted griffon occurrence, or density (outputs of the HFAM and IFAM), were individually intersected with the layer that indicates the locations of the ‘unsafe’ powerlines. These intersects are depicted in hierarchical mode and expressed according to a number of four risk categories (very high, high, medium and low). The final spatial output of the study is a map that identifies priority powerlines for mitigation against griffon mortality caused by electrocutions and collisions with powerline infrastructur...|$|R

In this paper, an innovative modelling approach is applied to impulsive noises which are studied here directly at their sources. Noise at receiver would be simply the noise model at source convolved by powerline channel block.

40|$|D. Ing. The {{technique}} {{of using a}} live power cable to simultaneously transport a communication signal, has been practiced since the early 1900 ’s. In most cases, power-line communications has been implemented as a retrofit technology, with its main benefit being the utilization of a ‘free’ existing network. This driving force of power-line communications is typical for high-, medium-, and low-voltage distribution networks, as well as intra-building networks currently targeted for home automation and home networking. Researchers have thus focused on the optimum use of these existing power-line channels, often accepting the inherent drawbacks of this hostile communication channel. Apart from unpredictable noise sources, two main disadvantages of the low-voltage <b>powerline</b> <b>network</b> as a communication channel, are i) the unknown power cable characteristics and topology and ii) time-dependent fluctuation of the power-line impedance level as loads are unpredictable switched into, {{and out of the}} network. These two factors have obscured the requirements for proper coupling and impedance adaptation to the degree that most researchers and manufacturers have merely accepted this typical ≈ 20 -dB coupling loss as one of the inherited disadvantages of the power-line channel. Most researchers and manufacturers have thus defaulted to a guessed power-line impedance level, and have used one fixed coupler winding ratio under all circumstances, regardless of power-line conditions. This study has shown that proper coupling and impedance adaptation can yield significant transmission gains even with limited (qualitative) knowledge of a power-line channel and its topology. After formulating design steps for an impedance-adapting coupler that facilitates bidirectional transmission, the impact of the fluctuating power-line impedance on coupler bandwidth was investigated. Next, impedance adaptation strategies were considered and the tradeoff between series cable requirements and parallel load requirements was explored. A model of sufficient simplicity was developed to facilitate qualitative description and classification of power outlets – functioning as communication nodes. Very interesting simulation results were obtained and these were verified using a laboratory setup of characterized power cables and calibrated loads. Next, these simulation results were employed to improve power-line transmission over a live, uncharacterized 220 -V residential network by means of i) classifying typical residential rooms qualitatively in order to choose proper coupler winding ratios and ii) using an innovative dual coupler for dedicated on-off switching with harsh loads, thereby mitigating the fluctuating impact of said loads on low-voltage power-line communications...|$|E
40|$|Powerline Communication (PLC) {{has long}} been {{established}} for low data rate applications by the electric supply companies. Since 1991, the European CENELEC standard EN 50065 has ruled the use of 3 - 148. 5 KHz frequency range for narrow band PLC applications. Sim- ilar standard has been established by the IEEE in the US, where a frequency range of 50 - 450 KHz is available. The fast growth of Internet since the 1990 s accelerated the demands for digital communication services. Furthermore, with the develop- ment of in-home networking, {{there is a need}} to establish high speed data links between multiple household devices. This makes PLC sys- tems march rapidly into the high frequency range above 1 MHz. Exist- ing broadband PLC system in the 1. 6 - 30 MHz frequency range only provides data rates smaller than 200 Mbps. With the growing demand of multimedia services such as High De nition (HD) video streaming, much faster transmission speed up to Gigabits per second is required and this can be achieved by increasing the operating frequencies. Ultra Wideband (UWB) transmission in free space provides extremely broad bandwidth for short-range, high data rate applications. If UWB signals could be transmitted over the powerline channels in the high frequency range above 30 MHz, data rates up to gigabits per second could be achieved. In this thesis, the possibility of implementing ultra wideband trans- mission over the low voltage indoor powerline is investigated. The starting point is to understand the signal propagation characteristics over powerline cables, in the UWB frequency range. Experimental re- sults indicate that the signal degrades at an acceptable rate over the mains cable in a scaled down UWB frequency band (50 MHz - 1 GHz), which provides a potential operation band for UWB over PLC ap- plications. Key component for the PLC system, a broadband Radio Frequency (RF) coupler is designed and developed, to introduce UWB signals to the transmission channel. With the channel properties and coupling unit, extensive experimental investigations are carried out to analyse the <b>powerline</b> <b>network</b> environment, including channel loss, noise and radiated emission. Furthermore, theoretical channel capac- ity and link budget are derived from measured parameters. It is shown that the indoor powerline is a suitable media for data transmission in the high frequency range from 50 to 550 MHz in the home environment. Finally, system level performance is analysed by modelling the Phys- ical Layer (PHY) data transmission.

40|$|PhDPowerline Communication (PLC) {{has long}} been {{established}} for low data rate applications by the electric supply companies. Since 1991, the European CENELEC standard EN 50065 has ruled the use of 3 - 148. 5 KHz frequency range for narrow band PLC applications. Sim- ilar standard has been established by the IEEE in the US, where a frequency range of 50 - 450 KHz is available. The fast growth of Internet since the 1990 s accelerated the demands for digital communication services. Furthermore, with the develop- ment of in-home networking, {{there is a need}} to establish high speed data links between multiple household devices. This makes PLC sys- tems march rapidly into the high frequency range above 1 MHz. Exist- ing broadband PLC system in the 1. 6 - 30 MHz frequency range only provides data rates smaller than 200 Mbps. With the growing demand of multimedia services such as High De nition (HD) video streaming, much faster transmission speed up to Gigabits per second is required and this can be achieved by increasing the operating frequencies. Ultra Wideband (UWB) transmission in free space provides extremely broad bandwidth for short-range, high data rate applications. If UWB signals could be transmitted over the powerline channels in the high frequency range above 30 MHz, data rates up to gigabits per second could be achieved. In this thesis, the possibility of implementing ultra wideband trans- mission over the low voltage indoor powerline is investigated. The starting point is to understand the signal propagation characteristics over powerline cables, in the UWB frequency range. Experimental re- sults indicate that the signal degrades at an acceptable rate over the mains cable in a scaled down UWB frequency band (50 MHz - 1 GHz), which provides a potential operation band for UWB over PLC ap- plications. Key component for the PLC system, a broadband Radio Frequency (RF) coupler is designed and developed, to introduce UWB signals to the transmission channel. With the channel properties and coupling unit, extensive experimental investigations are carried out to analyse the <b>powerline</b> <b>network</b> environment, including channel loss, noise and radiated emission. Furthermore, theoretical channel capac- ity and link budget are derived from measured parameters. It is shown that the indoor powerline is a suitable media for data transmission in the high frequency range from 50 to 550 MHz in the home environment. Finally, system level performance is analysed by modelling the Phys- ical Layer (PHY) data transmission.

40|$|Individuals seeking GSNA {{certification}} {{are required}} to submit a practical assignment to address the auditing of an information system, network or combination of both. To this end, the following paper was developed to address the certification requirements by documenting a security analysis and audit of HomePlug <b>Powerline</b> Communication <b>networks.</b> HomePlug devices permit individual workstations or entire network segments to be bridged over standard AC power lines. To date, the security exposures presented by the HomePlug technology have not been evaluated. This paper was developed to address the gap in knowledge regarding HomePlug devices and their inevitable use in Small Office / Home Office (SOHO) or Remote Office / Branch Office (ROBO) environments. The HomePlug standard will be discussed, security risks will be identified and then an audit approach will be proposed to detect and mitigate an...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper initiates {{the study}} of {{broadcast}} in a <b>powerline</b> communication <b>network,</b> where nodes communicate by local broadcasts in the grid, and where {{the quality of the}} communication links is subject to uncertainty. We first show that state-of-the-art broadcast algorithms for known topologies fail to broadcast messages in such a challenging environment, even when the link quality uncertainty is small. We then present a deterministic algorithm COLORCAST that distributes a message to all nodes in the network in time Θ(n). The algorithm is based on graph coloring and avoids collisions while guaranteeing a high parallelism. In particular, COLORCAST strictly outperforms ex-isting deterministic broadcast algorithms for unknown topologies in the sense that its time complexity is asymptotically lower than the best possible runtime for the unknown setting. Our formal analysis is complemented with a simulation study on real grid topologies, which confirms the benefits of COLORCAST compared to state-of-the-art protocols. I...|$|R
50|$|Most {{residential}} and small-office DSL implementations reserve low frequencies for POTS, so that (with suitable filters and/or splitters) the existing voice service continues to operate {{independent of the}} DSL service. Thus POTS-based communications, including fax machines and analog modems, can share the wires with DSL. Only one DSL modem can use the subscriber line at a time. The standard way to let multiple computers share a DSL connection uses a router that establishes {{a connection between the}} DSL modem and a local Ethernet, <b>Powerline,</b> or Wi-Fi <b>network</b> on the customer's premises.|$|R
