5000|$|Currently, {{there is}} an intense debate {{concerning}} professionals in the public sector. Many of the pressures that professionals face {{are related to the}} difficulties they have with the policies they have to implement.

The policy alienation framework is used to analyze this topic.It has been shown that policy alienation increases resistance to a new policy, lowers behavioral support for the policy and decreases job satisfaction of public professionals.

40|$|This paper systematises {{problems}} in European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) implementation in three fields {{of research and}} analyses them within the external governance framework, {{in order to find}} reasons for ENP's little effectiveness. Based on two research questions and by comparing internal structural {{problems in}} the EU, domestic factors in partner countries and international influence to effectiveness conditions from external governance theory, the thesis narrows down key aspects that the external <b>policy's</b> <b>effectiveness</b> depends on. The author's own contribution is the most evidently expressed in the third part where findings are compared to theory and analysed via empirical evidence. The most decisive aspects were found to be domestic factors in partner countries, such as political regime, the interests of governments, lack of democracy, national challenges and possible conflicts in partner countries. However, internal contradictions of the ENP structure – such as EU inconsistency in conditionality application, lack of consensus and focus, conflicting goals, inappropriate one-size fitsall structure and not offering a motivating enough outcome for conducting reforms – and international variables, such as the projection of EU as a soft power, regional competition, possible alternatives to EU integration and Russian foreign policy in its near abroad, have also had its influence on ENP's performance in some cases. The analysis in this paper proves the hypothesis that external <b>policy's</b> <b>effectiveness</b> depends more on external factors than on the policy's internal structur...|$|R

We are trying to make a fine analysis of the concepts and the phenomena which give thecharacteristics of the fiscal anti-crisis <b>policy’s</b> <b>effectiveness.</b> We estimate the effectiveness of the fiscal measures only incomparison to other financial policies (monetary policy and budget policy) and by making an analyze of the effectsproduced by taking fiscal policy decisions in a normative analysis. We reached a final conclusion upon the fiscal policyby examining the theoretical and the practical research so far. So, on the one hand, the fiscal policy in order to achieveits goal must be combined with the other macroeconomic policies and on the other hand, the fiscal policy used toreduce the massive fiscal pressures has low results in what concerns the stimulation of investments and aggregatesupply. An active budgetary policy which includes public investment spending can correct the macroeconomicimbalances (both on the market of goods and services and on the market of labor) on short and on long-term only withthe condition of respecting certain limits of the budget’s deficit and of the public debt, when it comes to times ofrecession and economic crisis.

Oil conservation undertaken unilaterally by the OECD can lead to lower world oil prices, and offsetting increases in oil consumption elsewhere.

We also examine the effect of adding and excluding countries to a coordinated policy of oil conservation. ...|$|R

Wieser claimed that idealized, refined, and self-contained models may not be useful tools for economic policy, resulting therefore in a suboptimal solution.
