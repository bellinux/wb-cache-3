5|$|One {{advantage}} of this camera system {{is that it allows}} the game designers to use the language of film. Indeed, like filmmakers, they have the <b>possibility</b> <b>to</b> create a mood through camerawork and careful selection of shots. Games that use this kind of technique are often praised for their cinematic qualities.|$|E
5|$|The second idea {{means that}} {{processes}} can offer their services to other processes by providing virtual files {{that appear in}} the other processes' namespace. The client process's input/output on such a file becomes inter-process communication between the two processes. This way, Plan 9 generalizes the Unix notion of the filesystem as the central point of access to computing resources. It carries over Unix's idea of device files {{to provide access to}} peripheral devices (mice, removable media, etc.) and the <b>possibility</b> <b>to</b> mount filesystems residing on physically distinct filesystems into a hierarchical namespace, but adds the <b>possibility</b> <b>to</b> mount a connection to a server program that speaks a standardized protocol and treat its services as part of the namespace.|$|E
40|$|The yield {{variations}} between {{years between}} farms and fields and within fields were discussed, {{with emphasis on}} variations caused by soil., weather, and/or technical factors. The discussions included {{the causes of the}} variations, the requirements for avoiding low yields:; and the need for research. Main topics of discussion were the <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> increase the crop yield on soils with low yield level, the <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> get a high quality seedbed, an even plant stand and a uniform ripening, the <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> avoid damages on soil structure the technical <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> carry out seedbed preparation and sowing more independent of the moisture situation, and the timeliness effects of machinery capacity and crop rotation...|$|R
40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} can {{be reduced}} by traffic control. Individual traffic control gives the largest range of <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> control traffic. However, having more <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> intervene also raises the question {{what is the best}} process to control. This paper first explores the <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> intervene in the traffic processes. Then, the paper lists the best <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> alleviate traffic congestion based on insights from traffic flow theory. It is discussed which measures are best to take in which conditions, taking into account that drivers can be advised on headway, speed or lane. The paper also shows the structure and the elements required to calculate the optimal advice. Finally, the paper shows what, qualitatively, are expected to be the best control strategies for a variety of traffic condition...|$|R

5|$|However, {{languages}} {{differ from}} biological organisms {{in that they}} readily incorporate elements from other languages {{through the process of}} diffusion, as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their first language or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming endangered as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the <b>possibility</b> <b>to</b> participate in larger and more influential speech communities.|$|E
5|$|Meråker saw in {{industrial}} boom {{due to the}} railway. There was already a copper mine and smelters at Kopperå, and they saw the railway as a <b>possibility</b> <b>to</b> change from locally produced charcoal to imported coke. A pulp mill opened in 1887, but burned down in 1912. The most important industry was the carbide factory that opened in Kopperå in 1900—Meraker Smelteverk. Though located close to the hydroelectricity sources in Meråker, the import and export of raw and finished materials {{would not have been}} possible without the railway. A port for the plant was built at Muruvik in 1918.|$|E
