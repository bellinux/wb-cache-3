500|$|Microsoft Services Agreement reads {{that the}} company's online {{services}} may automatically [...] "download software updates or configuration changes, {{including those that}} prevent you from accessing the Services, playing counterfeit games, or using unauthorized hardware peripheral devices." [...] Critics interpreted this statement as implying that Microsoft would scan for and delete unlicensed software installed on devices running Windows10. However, others pointed out that this agreement was specifically for Microsoft online services such as Microsoft account, Office 365, Skype, as well as Xbox Live, and that the offending passage most likely referred to digital rights management on Xbox consoles and first-party games, and not plans to police pirated video games installed on Windows10 PCs. Despite this, some torrent trackers announced plans to block Windows10 users, also arguing that the operating system could send information to anti-piracy groups that are affiliated with Microsoft. Writing about these allegations, Ed Bott of ZDNet compared Microsoft's privacy policy to Apple's and Google's and concluded that [...] "after carefully reading the Microsoft Services Agreement, the Windows license agreement...and the Microsoft <b>Privacy</b> <b>Statement</b> carefully, I don't see anything that looks remotely like Big Brother." [...] Columnist Kim Komando argued that [...] "Microsoft might in the future run scans and disable software or hardware it sees as a security threat," [...] consistent with the Windows10 update policy.|$|E

40|$|Because banks {{deal with}} highly {{personal}} detailed and sensitive information, {{they need to}} establish and maintain the confidence of their customers more assiduously than most other businesses. The rise of internet banking and the advantages to be gained from the garnering of personal data from websites places banks in a position to exploit customer data in a way that might infringe ethical considerations. This investigation analyses the website <b>privacy</b> <b>statements</b> of New Zealand banks in terms of the provisions of the New Zealand Privacy Act. The intention was to find an objective basis for the assessment of business integrity, to explore how confidence in electronic commerce can be assured. The investigation finds that the use of privacy legislation principles as a means of evaluating website <b>privacy</b> <b>statements</b> is revealing and convincing. It is considered that customer confidence will increasingly impact on Internet businesses, and business integrity as demonstrated by comprehensive and relevant <b>privacy</b> <b>statements</b> {{will go a long way}} to provide those assurances...|$|R

Using realistic web pages as stimuli, we find that <b>privacy</b> <b>statements</b> do little to ease consumer concerns about the disposal and use of personal information whereas longer term measures strategic options such as developing a stronger brand image have a strong affect, even to the extent that consumers become willing to provide their personal information to websites with a strong brand name yet unwilling to share their personal information with websites with a weak brand name...|$|R

40|$|Proponents of {{e-commerce}} {{have known}} for some time that limited participation by consumers partially reflects their concern over the privacy of personal information. To address consumer concerns, web site operators have employed security mechanisms, including <b>privacy</b> policy <b>statements</b> to increase their perceived trustworthiness. While empirical evidence is limited, there is some question regarding the ability of <b>privacy</b> policy <b>statements</b> to engender significantly greater levels of trust. The limited effectiveness of such statements may reflect their voluntary implementation, self-enforcement, and significant variance (protection and enforcement) from one web site to another. One possible remedy would be the imposition of legally mandated statements. This study examined the efficacy of legally mandated privacy policies vis-à-vis both voluntary statements of varying degrees of protection and the absence of any such statement. The results were mixed, as legally mandated <b>privacy</b> policy <b>statements</b> were found to be comparable to strong voluntary statements, but superior to none, weak or moderate policies. Perhaps more important, the nature of the <b>privacy</b> policy <b>statement</b> interacted with type of information requested...|$|R

40|$|Given the {{ubiquitous}} nature of technology, privacy remains a focal issue. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to incorporate individual personality variables into a research model that helps explain and predict concerns about information privacy, computer anxiety, and behavioral intentions. The personality traits investigated include morality, self efficacy, risk taking, trust, and anxiety. Data was collected via a survey instrument that was completed by undergraduate college students. Analysis of the data indicates that morality and self efficacy have a positive, significant influence on individual concerns for information privacy (CFIP). Risk taking was found to have a negative, significant influence on CFIP. In addition, anxiety exerted a significant influence on computer anxiety. Both CFIP and computer anxiety were positively related to behavioral intentions. Individuals who possess high levels of morality and self efficacy and low levels of risk taking are more likely to be concerned about information privacy. Practitioners can benefit by establishing <b>privacy</b> <b>statements,</b> policies, and standards that emphasize low risk to the individual as well as highlight ethical responsibility and integrity in their practices regarding personal information. The results provided here further empirical knowledge by expanding an existing theoretical model to incorporate the role of individual characteristics in influencing concerns for information privacy.
