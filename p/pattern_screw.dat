40|$|Silicon-carbide- (SiC-) based power devices {{could enable}} {{substantial}} aerospace electronics benefits over today's silicon-based electronics. However, present-day SiC wafers contain electrically harmful dislocations (including micropipes) that are unpredictably distributed in high densities across all commercial 4 H- and 6 H-SiC wafers. The NASA Glenn Research Center recently demonstrated a crystal growth process that moves SiC wafer dislocations to predetermined lateral positions in epitaxial layers {{so that they}} can be reproducibly avoided during subsequent SiC electronic device fabrication. The process starts by reactive ion etching mesa patterns with enclosed trench regions into commercial on-axis (0001) 4 H- or 6 H-SiC substrates. An example of a pregrowth mesa geometry with six enclosed triangular-shaped trench regions is shown. After the etch mask is stripped, homoepitaxial growth is carried out in pure stepflow conditions that enable thin cantilevers to grow laterally from the tops of mesas whose pregrowth top surfaces are not threaded by substrate screw dislocations. The image in the bottom figure shows the postgrowth structure that forms after the lateral cantilevers expand to coalesce and completely roof over each of the six triangular trench regions. Atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements of the roof revealed that three elementary screw dislocation growth spirals, each shown in the AFM insets of the bottom image on the previous page, formed in the film roof at three respective points of cantilever film coalescence. The image above shows the structure following an etch in molten potassium hydroxide (KOH) that produced surface etch pits at the dislocation defects. The larger KOH etch pits [...] S 1, S 2, and S 3 [...] shown in this image correspond to screw dislocations relocated to the final points of cantilever coalescence. The smaller KOH etch pits are consistent with epilayer threading edge dislocations from the pregrowth substrate mesa (P 1, P 3, and P 4) and a final cantilever coalescence point (P 2). No defects (i. e., no etch pits) are observed in other cantilevered portions of the film surface. On the basis of the principle of dislocation Burgers vector conservation, we hypothesize that all vertically propagating substrate dislocations in an enclosed trench region become combined into a single dislocation in the webbed film roof at the point of final roof coalescence. The point of final roof coalescence, and therefore the lateral location of a webbed roof dislocation, can be designed into the pregrowth mesa <b>pattern.</b> <b>Screw</b> dislocations with predetermined lateral positions can then be used to provide the new growth steps necessary for growing a 4 H/ 6 H-SiC epilayer with a lower dislocation density than the substrate. Devices fabricated on top of such films can be positioned to avoid the preplaced dislocations...|$|E

This design allows the surgeon to select, depending {{on the degree of}} stability present once the fracture is reduced, the configuration of screws to use.

40|$|Abstract. The paper firstly numerically simulates the coupled {{model of}} {{triangle}} fastening screw threads {{in the application}} of ANSYS software. Calculate stress intensity of the screw thread on the axial pressure of 200 MPa. The fittest coupled turn number of the screw nut is designed to make sure the strength of coupled teeth and make every turn of the screw thread go on very well and also save material. The maximum equivalent stress of the screw thread changes linearly with the axial pressure. The stress of the thread's root is greater than that of the thread's top so that the root is easily damaged.

40|$|This study {{employs the}} {{discrete}} element method (DEM) to simulate particulate flow and investigate mixing {{performance of a}} lab-scale double screw mixer. The simulation employs polydispersed biomass and glass bead particles based on experiments conducted in previous studies. Visual examination of particle distribution and statistical analysis of particle residence times of experimental data served as model validation. Statistical analysis indicates a maximum 9. 8 % difference between the experimental and simulated biomass particle mean residence time, and visual observations suggest the simulation captures the particle mixing trends observed in the experiments. Results indicate that the particle mean mixing time, non-dimensionalized by ideal flow time in the plug flow reactor, varies between 1. 008 and 1. 172, and it approaches 1 with increasing biomass feed rate. The mixing index profile in the axial direction shows a mixing-demixing-mixing oscillation <b>pattern.</b> Increasing <b>screw</b> pitch length is detrimental to mixing performance; decreasing the solid particle feed rate reduces the mixing degree; and increasing the biomass to glass bead size ratio decreases mixing performance. A comparison of a binary, single-sized biomass and glass particles mixture to a multicomponent mixture indicates that the binary system has similar mixing pattern as a multicomponent system. These findings demonstrate that DEM is a valuable tool for the design and simulation of double screw mixing systems...|$|R
30|$|There is also {{an issue}} on how Steinmann pins {{can be used to}} {{reconstruct}} the defects left in proximal tibias. Toy et al. examined this by looking at three groups—proximal tibia defects reconstructed with cement alone, defects fixed with cement and intramedullary Steinmann pins, and defects fixed with cement and diverging Steinmann pins that engage the opposite, intact cortex in the proximal tibia [13]. They found the diverging pin construct to be mechanically superior to cement alone and cement with intramedullary Steinmann pins. They attributed this to the diverging screws being anchored into the strong bone of the intact tibial condyle. They also noticed less separation at the cement bone interface which they hypothesized was the cause of the decreased rate of intra-articular failure in this group. The tibias treated with a diverging <b>screw</b> <b>pattern</b> failed with extra-articular fractures. These fractures would be easier to treat in a patient and would not require a large endoprosthetic or allograft reconstruction because of destruction of the joint surface.|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} and computational investigation of cortical bone failure mechanisms {{has been conducted}} in this thesis. Firstly, a computational comparison of four methods of proximal humeral fracture fixation was conducted. Peak stresses were predicted at the screw cortical bone interface. Carbon fibre reinforced PEEK (CFPEEK) devices were proposed {{as an alternative to}} existing metallic devices. It was demonstrated that CFPEEK devices lowered stresses at the screw cortical bone interface, thus lowering the risk of screw pullout/pushout. Next, a novel experimental test rig was developed, so that crack <b>patterns</b> during <b>screw</b> pullout could be identified in real time as the screw was removed from the cortical bone. Pullout tests were conducted with; (i) osteons aligned parallel to the central axis of the screw (longitudinal pullout) and (ii) osteons aligned perpendicular to the central axis of the screw (transverse pullout). This experimental study uncovered for the first time, the relationship between the microstructural alignment of cortical bone, the pullout strength and the crack patterns. Two methods of computational modelling were subsequently developed to capture the relationship uncovered during the experimental screw pullout study. The first method of element deletion required the use of a phenomenological biphasic multi-layered composite model. This model accurately predicted both the pullout force and crack patterns for longitudinal and transverse pullout. The element deletion method was limited to 2 D simulations therefore an alternate method with a lower computational expense was investigated. The second method involved the development of anisotropic damage initiation criteria in conjunction with the extended finite element method (XFEM). In this case, it was not necessary to explicitly represent the geometric microstructure of bone thus lowering the computational demand. This model accurately predicted the relationship between the osteon alignment, failure forces and crack propagation orientation for mode I, mode II and mixed mode loading. Application, of this fully calibrated anisotropic damage XFEM predictive framework, to screw pullout and 3 D simulations of proximal humeral fracture repair, highlighted the potential future application of this method in the field of orthopaedic device design...|$|R
50|$|At the {{fundamental}} level, optical activity {{is a case}} of circular birefringence, and can best be understood in that way. Whereas linear birefringence in a crystal involves a small difference in the phase velocity of light of two different linear polarizations, circular birefringence implies a small difference in the velocities between right and left-handed circular polarizations. Think of one enantiomer in a solution as a large number of little helices (or screws), all right-handed, but in random orientations. Birefringence of this sort is possible even in a fluid because the handedness of the helices is not dependent on their orientation: even when the direction of one helix is reversed, it still appears right handed. And circularly polarized light itself is chiral: as the wave proceeds in one direction the electric (and magnetic) fields composing it are rotating clockwise (or counterclockwise for the opposite circular polarization), tracing out a right (or left) handed <b>screw</b> <b>pattern</b> in space. In addition to the bulk refractive index which substantially lowers the phase velocity of light in any dielectric (transparent) material compared to the speed of light (in vacuum), there is an additional interaction between the chirality of the wave and the chirality of the molecules. Where their chiralities are the same, there will be a small additional effect on the wave's velocity, but the opposite circular polarization will experience an opposite small effect as its chirality is opposite that of the molecules.|$|R
40|$|The screw {{fastening}} torque applied during bone fracture fixation has a decisive influence on subsequent bone healing. Insufficient screw tightness {{can result in}} device/construct instability; conversely, excessive torques risk damaging the bone causing premature fixation failure. This effect is even more prominent in osteoporotic bone, a condition associated annually with almost 9 million fractures worldwide. During fracture fixation, screw tightening torque is applied using subjective feel. This approach may not be optimal for patient"s recovery, increasing risk of fixation failure, particularly in osteoporotic bone, and potentially require revision surgical interventions. Besides bone density, various factors influence the performance of screw fixation. These factors include bone geometry, cortical thickness and time-dependant relaxation behaviour of the bone. If the influence of {{screw fastening}} torque on the bone and relationships between these factors was better understood, the surgical technique could be optimised {{to reduce the risk}} of complications. Within this study, we developed an axisymmetric finite element (FE) model of bone screw tightening incorporating viscoelastic behaviour of the cortical bone such as creep and stress relaxation. The model anticipated time-dependent behaviour of the bone for different bone thickness and density after a typical bone fixation screw had been inserted. The idealised model has been developed based on CT scans of bones with varying densities and inserted screws. The model was validated through a series of experiments involving bovine tibiae (4 - 5 months) to evaluate the evolution of surface strains with time (Ncorr v 1. 2). Stress distribution was assessed in photoelastic experiments using acrylic analogues. Relaxation tests have been performed in aqueous environment for up to 48 hours to ensure the relaxation would be complete. The creep behaviour (maximum principal strain) was compared against computational predictions. Our early simulations predicted relaxation strains on the surface of the bone to be 1. 1 % within 24 hours comparing favourably to 1. 3 % measured experimentally. Stress distribution patterns were in agreement with photoelastic results. Using experimentally derived viscoelastic properties, the model has the potential to predict creep and stress relaxation <b>patterns</b> after <b>screw</b> insertion with different fastening torques for bones with varying density and geometry. We aim to develop this into a planning tool providing guidance to surgeons for optimal tightening when using screw fixation, particularly in reduced quality bone...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{includes}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} behaviour of steel fibre reinforced high performance concrete (SFRHPC) under biaxial loading conditions. Also included are constitutive models to enable numerical predictions of the strength behaviour of such a material. Within the experimental stage a large biaxial test machine was designed and manufactured. The load capacity of each axis was 2000 kN. Special thought {{was given to the}} load platen system because of the friction which occurs between the platen system and the concrete specimen. Brush bearing platens and solid steel blocks with and without Teflon friction reducing pads were tried. Because the brush platen and the Teflon pads were constantly damaged during testing, solid steel block platens were finally used. For tests where tension loads were involved, experiments were carried out with dog-bone shaped specimens and specimens glued on to the platens. Finally, the tension loads were transferred through threaded rods cast into the specimens and connected to the machine <b>patterns</b> with <b>screws.</b> Modern control schemes and high speed data acquisition systems were used to monitor the material response and to collect experimental stress and strain results. The principal deformations were monitored and the crack patterns and failure modes examined. Failure envelopes were developed based on the strength data for each fibre variable. The load capacity of SFRHPC under biaxial load conditions was found to be larger than for plain HPC for all fibre types and volume fractions. The stress-strain recordings indicated a linear behaviour almost up to failure. The examined failure mode between plain and steel fibre HPC was similar and all specimens failed very suddenly with a splitting failure type. The test variables included four different types of hooked ended steel fibres with different fibre volume fractions from plain to 2 % in 0. 5 % steps. The specimens were tested under the entire range of stress combinations including uniaxial compression and tension and biaxial compression-compression and compression-tension. As a result the specimen still failed in an explosive manner but the pieces were still connected together by fibres after failure. The biaxial strength compared to the uniaxial strength increased more, as observed with normal strength concrete. With the addition of fibres the biaxial strength behaviour of HPC was almost the same as for plain normal strength concrete. The deformation characteristics of plain and SFRHPC showed a linear behaviour up to a higher stress than normal strength concrete. In fact the linear limit was almost as high as the failure load. The examined strength data was used to model the biaxial strength envelopes of HPC and SFRHPC using different methods. These included the Ottosen failure criterion and the Willam and Warnke failure criterion. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{established}} {{treatment for}} trochanteric hip fractures is internal fixation, either intramedullary (nail) or extramedullary (plate). Approximately 10 % {{of these patients}} suffer from mechanical complications, the most frequent one being perforation of the lag screw through the femoral head into the hip joint (cut-out). This condition is painful and disabling, and requires revision surgery. The purpose of this thesis was to gain {{better understanding of the}} cut-out complication. The complication rate was evaluated in the retrospective series of 3066 consecutive patients treated with an intramedullary nail in a single centre over a 12 years period. Cut-out was found to be the most frequent complication albeit lower than in previous literature - 1. 85 % (57 patients) (Studies I and II). Combination of three factors: a comminute fracture, poor fracture reduction and non-optimal implant positioning was associated with an increased cut-out risk. From the range of cut-out <b>patterns,</b> i. e. <b>screw</b> cut-out in a variety of paths through the femoral head, it was observed to be a multidirectional event. To further analyse the pre-cut-out movements, Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA) method was applied in trochanteric hip fractures treated with intramedullary nails (Studies III and IV). Firstly, an experimental study was undertaken to confirm the applicability of RSA in trochanteric fractures. A SawbonesTM model of a trochanteric fracture was mounted on micrometre screws, and radiographed with different true reference displacements. RSA was shown to have high precision and accuracy in this application as translations and rotations in the fracture-implant model could be detected to within ± 0. 14 mm and ± 0. 03 mm (translations), and ± 0. 5 ° and ± 0. 18 ° (rotations). The last study prospectively evaluated the 3 D fracture-implant movements with the RSA method in 20 patients with stable trochanteric fractures treated with an intramedullary nail and followed for one year. Fracture-implant motion decreased after 3 months and no cut-out occurred. RSA detected clinically relevant movements: translation of the proximal tip of the lag screw in the femoral head, rotation of the head around the screw and screw movements relative to the nail. It is important to recognize the "fracture at risk" and, particularly in these patients, achieve anatomical fracture reduction and optimal implant placement. The migration of the implant in bone measured by RSA {{can be used as a}} cut-out predictor and enable evaluation of new methods in small groups of patients...|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to achieve adequate screw fixation for plate constructs in fractures with poor quality bone or in metaphyseal bone with extensive bone loss or comminution[7][17]. Furthermore, rescuing or augmenting failed screw fixation in inadequate bone with various cement products has yielded mixed results when tested with pure axial pullout loading[20][21]. In most cases, plate/screw constructs experience both vertical (translational) and horizontal (pullout) forces during physiologic loading[17][20][21]. The increased use of locked screws in plate constructs has also changed the loading <b>patterns</b> of bone <b>screws.</b> For this study, a novel “toggle-out” testing method was developed to more realistically simulate in-vivo loading of screw-plate constructs. Our objective was to compare the fixation of locked and non-locked screws in simulated cancellous bone of three different densities and to determine the effectiveness of augmentation of the screw fixation using either PMMA or a resorbable Calcium Phosphate cement in both stripped and oversized screw holes. Polyurethane foam blocks of 12. 5, 20, and 30 lb/ft 3 densities representing ostoporotic, normal, and high density cancellous bone respectively (Sawbones, Pacific Research Laboratories, Vashon Island, WA) were used as the bone surrogate for this study. Holes were drilled into the blocks perpendicular to a single face for placement of screws. All screws tested were 4 mm diameter, 32, 34, or 36 mm length stainless steel cancellous bone screws (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ). The holes were either 2. 5 mm diameter pilot holes, 4. 0 mm diameter (to simulate a stripped screw hole), or 12 mm diameter (bone loss / void). In the 4 mm stripped holes and the 12 mm holes, various cements were used to augment the screw fixation. The cements used were PMMA (Simplex, Stryker) and Calcium Phosphate Cement (Trabexus, Vivorté). After placement of the screws or after the cement had set for 24 hours, the blocks were mounted on a load frame (MTS Corp) for cyclic testing. The load fixture allowed screws to be configured either as locked screws or non-locked screws with respect to the plate. Along with cyclic transverse loading, a constant axial pullout force of 20 N was applied to each screw during testing. Cyclic “toggle” loading was applied for 1000 cycles at each of ± 25, ± 50, ± 100, and ± 200 N, or until failure by pullout or screw breakage. The average total displacement (positive and negative combined) value for each test was recorded over the last ten load cycles. Under all conditions, the locked screws exhibited significantly less displacement than the non-locked screws (p screws to be set up as locked screws for half of the test conditions. Locking screws exhibited less displacement than non-locking screws across all test samples (P= 0. 00). This study therefore supports the use of a locking-style cancellous screw in poor quality bone or when cement augmentation of large holes is warranted. The behavior in stripped holes was quite interesting and erratic. The non-locking screws easily pulled out in most cases, but the locking screws were able to survive more cycles. Also, the higher density bone made cement augmentation to prevent pullout more difficult because the cement (especially CaP) does not interdigitate with the high density material. Cement augmentation of large defects and stripped holes in poor quality bone {{has the potential to be}} successful regardless of the type of cement used because locking screws were significantly more stable than non-locking screws...|$|R
