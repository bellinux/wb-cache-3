Test traffic was stopped only after three months, {{at the end of}} February 1996, due to technical difficulties with the trains. Testing later resumed, and VR announced in 1997 that it would start normal operations with the Pendolino despite electrical problems.

While Jesus gave “an objective standard of truth: himself,” Hubbard said “Know thyself and the truth shall set you free,” expressing the subjectivity and existentiality of truth in Scientology, compared to the centrality of Jesus {{in the pursuit of}} truth in Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Some {{commentators}} {{have pointed out}} similarities to the 1996 shelling of Qana, in which over 100 civilians were killed by Israeli anti-personnel shells on a UN compound. In the first case, Israel alleged that it fired without knowing the compound harbored civilians. The allegation was <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>question</b> after evidence came out that, {{at the time of}} the strike, Israel was spying on the compound with two helipcoters and a drone. Both incidents resulted in increased pressure on Israel to declare a cease-fire. Qana's strategic location at the confluence of five major roadways and on the northern edge of Hezbollah-controlled southern Lebanon may have contributed as to its repeatedly being caught in the crossfire.|$|E

25|$|The {{addition}} of a bolt accelerator to the Lahti pistol was to ensure {{the performance of the}} pistol in arctic conditions in Finland. Bolt accelerators are more commonly found in machine guns to increase the rate of fire. The bolt accelerator in the Lahti works by having a crank lever strike the bolt of the pistol as it unlocks from firing. This thrusts the bolt mechanically instead of relying on the momentum of firing alone to move the bolt back. The value of the {{addition of}} the bolt accelerator was <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>question</b> with a batch of guns made without an accelerator being produced. The immediate recall of the pistols without bolt accelerators is thought to indicate the accelerator is not essential but useful in the operation of the gun.|$|E
25|$|The {{status of}} the genus as a truly {{carnivorous}} plant has been repeatedly <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>question.</b> In their natural habitat, all species have been observed playing host to live bugs of the genus Setocoris, which nourished themselves by eating prey caught by the plants. Following this discovery it was assumed that, as with the genus Roridula, the plants don't actually digest their prey themselves, rather relying on the bugs to do that. The plants, it was reasoned, benefited by absorbing nutrients from the excrements of the bugs, either through their leaves or through the ground. An indirect digestion of these nutrients by a chitinase producing fungus was even proposed. It wasn't until 2005 that direct digestion of insect prey by enzymes secreted by the sessile glands of B. filifolia was proven. Soon thereafter similar results were found with B. liniflora. These results clearly place this genus among the true carnivorous plants.|$|E
25|$|Urdu {{continued}} {{its role in}} developing a Muslim identity as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan was established {{with the intent to}} construct a homeland for Islamic believers. Several languages and dialects spoken throughout the regions of Pakistan produced an imminent need for a uniting language. Because Urdu was the symbol of Islamic identity in Northern India, it was selected as the national language for Pakistan. While Urdu and Islam together played important roles in developing the national identity of Pakistan, disputes in the 1950s challenged the necessity for Urdu as a national symbol and its practicality as the lingua franca. The significance of Urdu as a national symbol was downplayed by these disputes when English and Bengali were also accepted as official languages. In addition to the disagreements over the value of Urdu as a national language in Pakistan, recent Muslims in Asia question the necessity for the Urdu script to be distinctly different from the Hindi script. While early nineteenth century Muslims saw the Arabic script as part of their identity, certain modern Muslims choose to use a modified Hindi script in writing Urdu. Although Urdu was a distinct identity marker for Muslims in colonialist ruled India and a national symbol for Pakistan, its necessity has been <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>question</b> by modern Muslims in both India and Pakistan.|$|E
