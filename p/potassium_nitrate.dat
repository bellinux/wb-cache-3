5|$|The first <b>potassium</b> <b>nitrate</b> was transported on 8 December 1911, and {{two years}} later the plants were making a profit. Transported cargo {{increased}} from 110,000 tonnes per year to 250,000 tonnes in 1915, after the plant had been expanded, and up to 345,000 tonnes in 1917. The small hamlet of Rjukan had turned into a town, and in 1920 there were 11,651 people in Tinn. The 1920 were a tough time, and cargo decreased, but in 1929 the electric arc technology was replaced by the ammonia method, with the main product being <b>potassium</b> <b>nitrate.</b> During the 1930s other products came into production, including hydrogen and other gases, and from 1934 as the first plant in the world mass-produced heavy water.|$|E

During the construction one worker lost his life in a landslide, while two survived the accident. Housing was provided in simple barracks, and few laborers came with family. Prostitution and the sale of illegal liquor during the prohibition flourished; the lack of proper law enforcement making Vestfjorddalen known as a lawless valley.|$|E

Despite this, it is not very {{abundant}} in Earth's crust, making up only 19parts per million of this, on par with niobium, gallium, and lithium. The only important nitrogen minerals are nitre (<b>potassium</b> <b>nitrate,</b> saltpetre) and sodanitre (sodium nitrate, Chilean saltpetre). However, these have not been an important source of nitrates since the 1920s, when the industrial synthesis of ammonia and nitric acid became common.|$|E

5|$|Molten salt can be {{employed}} as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant, {{so that it can}} be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995–1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. The molten salt mixtures vary. The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate, <b>potassium</b> <b>nitrate</b> and calcium nitrate. It is non-flammable and nontoxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.|$|E

In 1988 Norsk Hydro terminated the ammonia production, and in 1991 they also closed down the production ammonium nitrate and <b>potassium</b> <b>nitrate,</b> along with the Rjukan Line. Within a few years the number of Norsk Hydro employees in Rjukan had been reduced from 1,760 to 530 people; 24 of these were employed by Norsk Transport operating the railway and railway ferries. All the employees were either retired or moved to other areas of Norsk Hydro's enterprise.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{revolution in}} England and the tariff {{policies of the}} British also caused massive de-industrialization in other sectors throughout India and Mysore. For example, the gunny bag weaving business had been a monopoly of the Goniga people, which they lost when the British began ruling the area. The import of a chemical substitute for saltpetre (<b>potassium</b> <b>nitrate)</b> affected the Uppar community, the traditional makers of saltpetre for use in gunpowder. The import of kerosene affected the Ganiga community which supplied oils. Foreign enamel and crockery industries affected the native pottery business, and mill-made blankets replaced the country-made blankets called kambli. This economic fallout {{led to the formation}} of community-based social welfare organisations to help those within the community to cope better with their new economic situation, including youth hostels for students seeking education and shelter. However, the British economic policies created a class structure consisting of a newly established middle class comprising various blue and white-collared occupational groups, including agents, brokers, lawyers, teachers, civil servants and physicians. Due to a more flexible caste hierarchy, the middle class contained a heterogeneous mix of people from different castes.|$|E

5|$|Potash is {{primarily}} a mixture of potassium salts because plants {{have little or no}} sodium content, and the rest of a plant's major mineral content consists of calcium salts of relatively low solubility in water. While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence that led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did not include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789. For a long time the only significant applications for potash were the production of glass, bleach, soap and gunpowder as <b>potassium</b> <b>nitrate.</b> Potassium soaps from animal fats and vegetable oils were especially prized because they tend to be more water-soluble and of softer texture, and are therefore known as soft soaps. The discovery by Justus Liebig in 1840 that potassium is a necessary element for plants and that most types of soil lack potassium caused a steep rise in demand for potassium salts. Wood-ash from fir trees was initially used as a potassium salt source for fertilizer, but, with the discovery in 1868 of mineral deposits containing potassium chloride near Staßfurt, Germany, the production of potassium-containing fertilizers began at an industrial scale. Other potash deposits were discovered, and by the 1960s Canada became the dominant producer.|$|E

In this study, the salinity of the evaporator concentrates was simulated by adding sodium or <b>potassium</b> <b>nitrates.</b> The length changes were measured, with displacement gauges consisting in linear variable differential transducers. Mortars prepared with solutions of KNO 3 or NaNO 3 exhibited expansion which increased with the nitrate concentration in the mixing solution, whatever the associated cations. The measured swelling was shown to be governed by a concentration effect which involved diffusion and osmosis: diffusion of the ions of the pore solution into the less concentrated curing solution, and water uptake by the material due to the osmotic pressure gradient between the pore and curing solutions...|$|R
40|$|Sharp line {{structure}} is {{observed in the}} low energy shoulder of the 3000 ‐A absorption band of crystalline nitrates that have been cooled to 4 °K. Single crystals of normal and of nitrogen‐ 15 isotopically substituted sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>nitrates</b> were examined spectrographically. Correlation between the spacings, polarization and orientation properties, isotope effect, and crystal field splitting of the spectra permitted their analysis. In terms of the D 3 h point symmetry of a free nitrate ion the excited electronic state is E′. This electronic configuration {{is one of three}} considered likely upon the basis of a LCAO molecular orbital treatment of the ion. The two asymmetric E′ vibrations of the ion predominantly contribute to the band structure. A large Franck‐Condon shift, an extensive weakening of force constants, and the character of the excited vibrations indicate that the excited ion is planar but expanded with perhaps some, but not a great amount of asymmetric distortion.

On a solid medium, the fertilizers at rates of 12 g N*m- 2 and 18 g N*m- 2 had an inhibitory effect on the growth of Sclerotium rolfsii mycelium. The highest effect was observed for urea. In contrast, Trichoderma harzianum assimilated all fertilizers but had a preference for sulfate ammonium.

40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} {{nitrogenous}} industrial explosives {{has come}} under intense scrutiny by environmental agencies due to emission of toxic fumes to the atmosphere during blasting of ammonium nitrate based explosives. Ammonium nitrate (AN) is a major ingredient in {{ammonium nitrate fuel oil}} (ANFO), and emulsion explosives, which are commonly applied in trench or surface mines blasting, and construction operations. It is well known that ammonium nitrate based explosives release toxic fumes (which contains NO and NO 2 emissions) under certain blasting condition, and/or oxygen rich explosive formulations. We investigated the effect of potassium on crystal structure, and thermal behaviour of ammonium nitrate. We observed multiphase structures in co-recrystallised ammonium nitrate containing low (2 - 4 mol %) and high (> 25 mol %) concentrations of potassium in the crystallisation solution; mol % is based only on K+ and NH 4 +.

Taking into account these points, several hundred mixtures have been investigated. It appeared that the commonly used mixtures of sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>nitrates</b> are so far the most promising candidates for high-temperature heat storage applications. Nevertheless, due to their weak stability at temperatures exceeding 550 °C, nitrates could be replaced by more stable suitable materials when higher operating temperatures are required (up to 700 °C). Due to their physicochemical and thermal properties and high thermal stability, molten alkali chloride salt mixtures are potential liquids {{to be used for}} sensible thermal energy storage (TES) such as in Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants and in fossil fuel powered plants to increase the operation flexibility. However, the application of molten chlorides at high-temperatures involves additional challenges such as increased corrosiveness. In the present work, we focus on the molten salts purity, because it has a direct influence on the corrosion rate of metals. Because some chloride salts are hygroscopic and heating in presence of water induces hydrolysis of the salt and formation of oxides/hydroxides. These compounds increase the redox potential of the salt and so its corrosion rate...|$|R
