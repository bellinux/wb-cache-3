40|$|In this {{experimental}} work {{the possibility of}} integrating piezoelectric textile fibres in knitted structures for a (fingertip) pressure sensing glove was investigated. The piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) yarn used generates a voltage when mechanically deformed. However while this yarn is highly sensitive to strain, {{it is not so}} sensitive to compression. The knitted structures used as the basis of this work are all of a basic nature e. g. single tricot and 1 x 1 rib. Applications could include healthcare, gaming, security and intelligent control. First, the piezoelectric yarn was incorporated directly into the knitted structures. This was unsuccessful due to instability of the fabric construction, enabling the piezoelectric yarn to relax. To introduce strain to the PVDF yarn in response to compression, a structure using thermoplastic blocks was developed. The blocks were glued to the <b>supporting</b> <b>fabric</b> while the PVDF yarn was placed in-between the two layers in course direction. The piezoelectric PVDF yarn is coated onto a <b>supporting</b> <b>fabric</b> using a conductive silicone which acts as the outer electrode. I...|$|R

The calculating analysis also takes material parameters and geometrical dimension into consideration. Based on a typical tunnel, the reliability degree of the whole system is calculated, which indicates that the reliability degree is rather smaller at a certain section of the <b>primary</b> <b>support,</b> but it can satisfy design requires of the whole system, and the tunnel stays in a safety state...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{practical}} method for estimating the weight of ro-ro deck structures. Preliminarily, the procedures for assessing the scantlings of platings, ordinary stiffeners and <b>primary</b> <b>supporting</b> members subjected to wheeled loads, are presented, in order {{to point out the}} parameters that influence the deck weight, such as ordinary stiffener spacing, transverse spacing, number of girders, web height of <b>primary</b> <b>supporting</b> members. The strength check of platings is rule based, while ordinary stiffeners are schematized as continuous beams; concerning the <b>primary</b> <b>supporting</b> members, instead, the direct scantling procedure, proposed in a previous paper, is adopted, schematizing the deck as an orthotropic plate with clamped boundary conditions in correspondence of the aft and fore bulkheads and the ship sides, in order {{to take into account the}} interaction of the two orthogonal beam sets. Some design charts are presented in order to determine the influence of the previously defined parameters on the deck weight or, similarly, on its equivalent thickness, spreading the stiffener and <b>primary</b> <b>supporting</b> member weight on the deck area. Finally, two numerical applications, relative to a Ro-ro PANAMAX ship, are presented, in order to evaluate the capability of the proposed technique...|$|R

5000|$|Reticella lace {{is a form}} of {{embroidery}} {{in which}} typical techniques of needlelace are used to embellish drawn thread work. It was first used in 16th century Italy.

Ruskin lace is in fact a near-modern form of it. Warp and weft threads are removed, and the remaining threads are overcast with buttonhole stitches, as in needlelace.|$|R
