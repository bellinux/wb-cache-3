40|$|Estuaries {{concentrate}} {{complex and}} often conflicting sets of natural, {{economic and social}} resources and activities bringing multiple challenges to institutional frameworks, planning and management approaches as well as governance practices dedicated to their protection, maintenance and resilience. Portugal has recently adopted {{a new set of}} estuary plans of regulatory nature, which combine the perspective of water resources management with that of land-use management. This paper explores the conceptual specificities of estuary planning and management in Portugal and their potential role in contexts of multiple resources, users, instruments and institutions. Given the mentioned complexity and vulnerability to global change, these plans may be crucial for seeking better environmental governance and greater resilience. The paper is structured in three parts. The first one through a literature review summarises some of the main conclusions about the role and specificities of governance in estuaries. The second part presents the legal and procedural features of estuary plans in Portugal and their integration within the water resources and land-use planning systems. The third part concentrates on the specificities of the River Vouga Estuary (Ria de Aveiro), a Natura 2000 area that needs to deal with different, and potentially conflicting, socioeconomic sectors. Departing from a SWOT analysis of the main environmental, socioeconomic and institutional features, the paper argues for the relevance of an innovative <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> <b>instrument</b> — capable of reducing the tensions inherent to local administrative boundaries and of contributing to a collective vision of the territory through the articulation of values, targets, instruments and means...|$|E

Three distinct geographic scales, Azores Archipelago (at regional level), S. Miguel Island (at island level) and Pico da Vara/Ribeira do Guilherme Special Protected Area (at local level) were used as study areas for five different case-studies, individually described and analyzed: (1) Mapping the ecological structure in small islands: the case-study of S. Miguel island (Archipelago of the Azores, Portugal); (2) A Methodological Proposal for the Development of Natura 2000 Sites Management Plans; (3) Assessing the effectiveness of high resolution satellite imagery for vegetation mapping in small islands protected areas; (4) Mapping invasive woody plants in Azores Protected Areas by using high-resolution multispectral imagery; (5) Linking GMES Space Component Sentinel Missions to Outermost Region’s environmental policies development – the Azores (Portugal) case-study.

40|$|Dispersed urbanization, urban <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> <b>instruments</b> such as zoning, {{and urban}} {{expansion}} zones, {{have become increasingly}} consistent in leading cities toward an uncertain and chaotic future. The urban perimeters of municipalities have been used increasingly in favor agents of the reproduction of unequal urban space, aggravating the process of socio-spatial segregation, the formation of urban gaps and real estate speculation. Inherent to this process, infrastructure, {{one of the most}} important components of urban land and one of the most costly for local governments, has become increasingly dispersed and obsolete in the midst of the disordered occupation of the city’s land. Based on the above, this paper aims to analyze the phenomenon of urban sprawl in the city of Londrina by means of geotechnologies and to identify the impacts that the form of land occupation the city has employed may cause on the current and future scenario of the municipality in general. To this end, thematic maps were drawn up from multiple sources, which, allied to a review of the literature, indicate that the municipality of Londrina exhibits intense characteristics of the phenomenon of urban sprawl, leading to consequences for territorial ordering and the egalitarian spatial distribution of essential services to the population...|$|R
40|$|Mounting {{research}} {{assesses the}} provision of regulating ecosystem services by green infrastructure in urban areas, but {{the extent to which}} these services can offer effective nature-based solutions for addressing urban climate change-related challenges is rarely considered. In this chapter, we synthesize knowledge from assessments of urban green infrastructure carried out in Europe and beyond to evaluate the potential contribution of regulating ecosystem services to offset carbon emissions, reduce heat stress and abate air pollution at the metropolitan, city and site scales. Results from this review indicate that the potential of regulating ecosystem services provided by urban green infrastructure to counteract these three climate change-related pressures is often limited and/or uncertain, especially at the city and metropolitan levels. However, their contribution can have a substantially higher impact at site scales such as in street canyons and around green spaces. We note that if regulating ecosystem services are to offer effective nature-based solutions in urban areas, it is critically important that green infrastructure policies target the relevant implementation scale. This calls for a coordination between authorities dealing with urban and environmental policy and for the harmonization of <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> <b>instruments</b> in a multilevel governance approach.

40|$|Marine {{protected}} area (MPA) management is {{the management of}} ecosystems not only for conserving marine resources but also for human purposes. While there is often detailed knowledge of specific research subjects and sites, and knowledge of broad scale processes, there are significant challenges in integrating current knowledge across the range of scales needed for effective management of MPA. Most agencies dealing with MPAs are beginning {{to learn how to}} design and conduct an effective participatory process for MPAs, to gain understanding of the implications of increased stakeholder involvement to improve the process. While there is growing awareness of the need for involvement, {{there is a lack of}} understanding of the implications of co-learning as an essential element in the process of stakeholder involvement. As policy-making continues to evolve, it is critical to understand the role of stakeholder involvement and, in particular, how participatory decision-making processes can be improved through mutual learning improvement. Significant stakeholder participation occurs in MPA when they see that their contributions to the process have helped shape a meaningful decision. Such participation can be fostered by enhancing stakeholders’ participation in the generation and application of knowledge, providing opportunities to exchange their learning, and strengthening their ability to deal with changes throughout the process. This study aims to understand the influences of <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> <b>instruments</b> fostering or hindering the co-learning systems using Moreton Bay Marine Park as a case study...|$|R

40|$|The thesis focuses {{the topic}} of {{squatter}} settlements located along borders in twin cities on the Amazon context. The study claims that Twin Cities are integrated by informality, in this case by squatter settlements along borders. In addition to the integration, these squatter settlements are transforming the border from a limit towards a social spatial construction of their territory. Based on that, the study looks for a cross border approach which can be developed by local governments of twin cities in order to manage squatter settlements along borders as a shared and common problem.  In order to develop the research, the study {{has been done in}} the case of Leticia (Colombia) and Tabatinga (Brazil) twin cities in the Amazon. The thesis is focused in a natural space which has been the border between these twin cities the San Antonio ravine. Along this “natural” limit between Colombia and Brazil has been taken place an occupation of squatter settlements that has transformed the international limit into an “informal” urban space. The thesis developed two approaches in order to study the mentioned case of squatter settlements located along borders in twin cities. First, the study developed a bottom up approach analysing socioeconomic and physical characteristics of squatter settlements inhabitants and comparing both squatter settlements based on fieldwork findings. The comparative study looks for symmetric and asymmetric issues between both squatter settlements which are a key output towards a cross border approach between the twin cities based on needs and characteristics of squatter settlements inhabitants in the Amazon context.  On the other hand, the study developed a review of urban policies of Colombia and Brazil looking for aspects that can be taking into account for local government of Leticia and Tabatinga in their local policies for managing squatter settlements on flood prone lands located on the border’s fringe. In addition, the study made a review of the current frontiers policies of both countries in order to find key elements that can used by local government for developing a cross border cooperation for managing squatter settlements in a cooperation and integration framework. Finally, the study looks for a short and long term appropriate approach for managing these two squatter settlements located along the border between the Leticia and Tabatinga twin cities. The recommendations for both terms can be useful input for future housing policies, <b>and</b> urban <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> <b>instruments</b> in the twin cities based on Amazon characteristics. Moreover, the research methodology developed in the study can be an appropriate research procedure for further urban studies in Leticia and Tabatinga twin cities, especially on squatter settlements along border’s fringe.

40|$|In February 2012, the Bligh Government {{introduced}} a new <b>plan</b> for coastal <b>management</b> <b>and</b> planning: the Queensland Coastal Plan (the Plan). The new Plan is intended to provide a coastal management framework that is clearer, more effective and that allows better integration with other <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> natural resource <b>management</b> <b>instruments.</b> More significantly, it is a State Planning Instrument that seeks to directly address the challenges of climate change through the statutory planning framework.

40|$|Cities {{and urban}} regions {{especially}} in the West German agglomerations are characterised by an unbroken dynamic development, connected with changes in land use from undeveloped land into settlement areas and traffic zones up to the rural districts far from the cities. Environmental loads, e. g. negative environmental effects on air quality and noise, and adverse affects on valuable habitats are negative consequences of the growing of urban regions. On the other hand, cities and urban regions shall contribute to a sustainable spatial development as agreed to in the Agenda 21 and prescribed by the Regional <b>Planning</b> Law <b>and</b> the Federal Building Code. In order to turn the spatial development of cities and urban regions towards a sustainable spatial development, adequate <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> <b>instruments</b> are required. The Directive of the European Union on {{the assessment of the}} effects of certain <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> programmes on the environment contains a framework, how the member states will have to take into consideration environmental aspects while drawing up or complementing certain <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> programmes. An environmental assessment shall be carried out for <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> programmes, which are likely to have significant environmental effects, e. g. for town <b>and</b> country <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> land use <b>planning,</b> <b>and</b> which set the framework for future development for projects submitted to an environmental impact assessment. The environmental assessment shall take into consideration reasonable alternatives including the zero-alternative. It shall contain a "screening" (necessity-check), a "scoping" (agreement on the scope of investigations), an "environmental report" and consultations of the public. The environmental report shall contain the analyse and evaluation of likely significant positive and negative effects on biodiversity, population and human health, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic factors, material assets, cultural heritage including architectural and archaeological heritage. The Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply the Directive up to 2004. The discussion on the implementation of the EU Directive is in full swing. In Germany, each drawing up of a new land use plan or regional plan will require an environmental assessment. In the case of changes or amendments of those plans, it will depend a. o. on the extent and amount of environmental effects of the plan, whether an environmental assessment has to be carried out or not. Whether and how an environmental assessment can be integrated into spatial <b>planning,</b> <b>and</b> whether the landscape plans already carry out environmental assessments or have to be developed further is under discussion controversially. Further questions are e. g. how the subjects of the assessment shall be defined in detail, how results of the environmental assessment can be monitored, how the environmental assessment can be integrated into the planning procedures without taking many financial and personal resources, and how and at which extent the public shall be consulted. The lecture will focus on how the Directive can be realised by spatial <b>and</b> landscape <b>planning,</b> especially which methodical questions spatial <b>and</b> landscape <b>planning</b> will have to solve in order to implement an environmental assessment for <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> programmes according to the EU Directive. ...|$|R

Characteristics of onset, duration, and severity of any discontinuation symptoms and spontaneous reports of taper/poststudy-emergent adverse events should be compared with those of the active comparator in these studies. Besides, common clinical practice supplies a number of problems associated with SSRI discontinuation syndrome as related to treatment <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management.</b> The recommended <b>instrument</b> for evaluating SSRI discontinuation syndrome symptoms is the Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) inventory.

The paper presents the Polish version of DESS inventory along with its application and interpretation instructions. DESS inventory is of substantial advance in common psychiatric practice as it enables effective SSRI discontinuation management on drug tapering and in case of the non-compliance with the treatment.

To complete the approach, QUT has instigated a top-level governance committee for IT to ensure alignment with organisational goals and strategies. This {{is an unusual}} development for IT <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> at an Australian university and attracted attention from the Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST) {{as well as other}} universities in the Australian tertiary education sector and led to the research study. This research studies the redevelopment of the information technology <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> approach. The survey research determines the level of integration of IT <b>and</b> university <b>planning,</b> <b>and</b> the correlation of this integration to effectiveness of IT planning. The case study documents the changes, highlights {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the new approach and provides a model for change in IT management at other Australian universities. It is evident from current literature on information technology <b>management</b> <b>and</b> strategic <b>planning</b> that these developments are validated as steps toward achieving best practice in information technology <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management.</b> Through rigorous conduct of interviews, observations and review of documentation and through application of a survey questionnaire to a defined population, the research reviews the developments and ongoing implementation of the <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> infrastructure. Among the outcomes from the new approach are better alignment of information technology investment with QUT goals and objectives, better benefits realisation from information technology investment, better project management of information technology development and innovation, and increased flexibility and accountability in information technology expenditure. Finally, a comparison to other information technology <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> methods in place at Australian universities demonstrates the uniqueness of the QUT approach.
