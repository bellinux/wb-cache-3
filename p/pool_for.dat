5|$|Originally, the {{compensation}} total offered to survivors was $7 million, which aroused controversy. The legislature eventually settled on $1.5 million: this would enable payment of $150,000 to each {{person who could}} prove he or she lived in Rosewood during 1923, and provide a $500,000 <b>pool</b> <b>for</b> people who could apply for the funds after demonstrating that they had an ancestor who owned property in Rosewood during the same time. The four survivors who testified automatically qualified; four others had to apply. More than 400 applications were received from around the world.|$|E

5|$|Pullman-Standard {{built the}} {{entirety}} of the equipment <b>pool</b> <b>for</b> the 1938 lightweight re-equipping, with the exception of two dining cars which were rebuilt in the Pennsylvania's Altoona shops. The equipment delivered included eight 18-roomette sleeping cars; two sleeper-bar-lounges; four 4-compartment, 2-drawing room, 4-double bedroom sleeping cars; two 13-double bedroom sleeping cars; and two View series sleeper-buffet-lounge-observation cars. The dining car seated 24 at tables (in both 1x1 and 2x2 configurations) and featured a small bar at one end with seating for two. The sleeper-bar-lounge included a secretary's room, barber shop, shower-bath, and a bar/lounge with both booth and chair seating.|$|E
5|$|The Waendel Leisure Centre is {{the main}} council-owned leisure centre in Wellingborough. The {{facility}} includes a six-lane 25 metre competition pool, varying in depth from 1 to 2 metres, and used for many purposes including the main training <b>pool</b> <b>for</b> Wellingborough Amateur Swimming Club. The pool is regularly used for small competitions, as other than Corby Pool {{it is the only}} other aptly equipt facility - boasting new starting blocks, as well as an integrated timing system and time board. The pool also has a small, shallow, 'teaching' pool, more suitable for non swimmers. Waendel also operates a newly refurbished gym on the upper level.|$|E
5|$|Mercury {{and most}} of its {{compounds}} are extremely toxic and must be handled with care; in cases of spills involving mercury (such as from certain thermometers or fluorescent light bulbs), specific cleaning procedures are used to avoid exposure and contain the spill. Protocols call for physically merging smaller droplets on hard surfaces, combining them into a single larger <b>pool</b> <b>for</b> easier removal with an eyedropper, or for gently pushing the spill into a disposable container. Vacuum cleaners and brooms cause greater dispersal of the mercury and should not be used. Afterwards, fine sulfur, zinc, or some other powder that readily forms an amalgam (alloy) with mercury at ordinary temperatures is sprinkled over the area before itself being collected and properly disposed of. Cleaning porous surfaces and clothing is not effective at removing all traces of mercury and it is therefore advised to discard these kinds of items should they be exposed to a mercury spill.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} item pool design {{that has the potential}} to improve on the quality of current item pools in educational and psychological testing and thus to increase both measurement precision and validity. The approach consists of the application of mathematical programming techniques to calculate optimal blueprints <b>for</b> item <b>pools.</b> These blueprints can be used to guide the item-writing process. Three different types of design problems are discussed: (1) item <b>pools</b> <b>for</b> linear tests; (2) item <b>pools</b> <b>for</b> computerized adaptive testing (CAT); and (3) systems of rotating <b>pools</b> <b>for</b> CAT. The paper concludes with an empirical example of the problem of designing a system or rotating item <b>pools</b> <b>for</b> CAT. (Contains 2 tables and 22 references.)

5|$|Purebred {{wild species}} evolved to a {{specific}} ecology can be threatened with extinction {{through the process of}} genetic pollution, the uncontrolled hybridization, introgression genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or out-competition from the heterosic hybrid species. When new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact, extinction in some species, especially rare varieties, is possible. Interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene <b>pool.</b> <b>For</b> example, the endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the domestic water buffalo. Such extinctions are not always apparent from a morphological standpoint. Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionary process, nevertheless, hybridization threatens the existence of rare species.|$|E
5|$|Raithel {{was awarded}} the Iron Cross 1st Class in late April 1941. Following the defeat of Greece and its allies, the {{division}} was deployed to Lapland in northern Finland in September 1941. Raithel remained as a battalion commander with the 143rd Gebirgsjäger Regiment of the division in Finland and was promoted to Major on 1 November 1941. Schörner became Raithel's mentor during their service with the 6th Gebirgs Division. In January 1942 he {{was awarded the}} German Cross in Gold. In August 1942 he was transferred to the Oberkommando des Heeres (Army Headquarters) reserve <b>pool</b> <b>for</b> an extended period, during which he returned to the mountain infantry school then served briefly with the 133rd Fortress Division on Crete. He was promoted to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) on 1 October 1943.|$|E
5|$|The {{syndicated}} version's potential contestants, {{depending on}} tryouts, {{are required to}} pass an electronically scored test comprising a set of thirty questions which must be answered within a 10-minute time limit. Contestants who fail the test are eliminated, while those who pass are interviewed for an audition by the production staff, and those who impress the staff the most are then notified by postal mail {{that they have been}} placed into a <b>pool</b> <b>for</b> possible selection as contestants. At the producers' discretion, contestants from said pool are selected to appear on actual episodes of the syndicated program; these contestants are given a phone call from staff and asked to confirm the information on their initial application form and verify that they meet all eligibility requirements. Afterwards, they are given a date to travel to the show's taping facilities to participate in a scheduled episode of the show. Unlike its ABC counterpart, the syndicated version does not offer transportation or hotel accommodations to contestants at the production company's expense; that version's contestants are instead required to provide transportation and accommodations of their own.|$|E

5|$|Meeting Chloe at {{the diner}} where her mother Joyce (Cissy Jones) works, they decide to {{experiment}} with Max's power at Chloe's secret scrapyard hideout. However, strain causes Max to have a nosebleed and faint. Chloe takes her back to Blackwell, but class is halted when everyone is called out to the courtyard. Kate commits suicide by jumping off {{the roof of the}} girls' dorm. Max manages to rewind and time stops unexpectedly as she reaches Kate, giving Max the opportunity to convince her to come down. Max ultimately resolves to uncover what happened to Kate and Chloe's missing friend Rachel Amber. Max and Chloe break into the principal's office that night to investigate and enter the <b>pool</b> <b>for</b> a swim before evading David Madsen (Don McManus), head of security at Blackwell and Chloe's stepfather, and fleeing back to Chloe's place. The next morning, they sneak into the motorhome of Frank Bowers (Daniel Bonjour), drug dealer and friend of Rachel, and learn that Rachel was in a relationship with Frank and lied to Chloe about it, causing Chloe to storm off feeling betrayed. Max returns to her dormitory and examines a childhood photo of her and Chloe, but is suddenly transported to the day the picture was taken. Max prevents Chloe's father William (Joe Ochman) from dying in a traffic collision, which inadvertently creates an alternative reality where William is alive but Chloe has been paralysed from the neck down {{as a result of a}} collision in her own car.|$|E
