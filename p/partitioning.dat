40|$|We study <b>partitions</b> {{of the set}} of all ((v) (3)) triples {{chosen from}} a v-set into {{pairwise}} disjoint planes with three points per line. Our <b>partitions</b> may contain copies of PG(2, 2) only (Fano <b>partitions)</b> or copies of AG(2, 3) only (affine <b>partitions)</b> or copies of some planes of each type (mixed <b>partitions).</b> We find necessary conditions for Fano or affine <b>partitions</b> to exist. Such <b>partitions</b> are already known in several cases: Fano <b>partitions</b> for v = 8 and affine <b>partitions</b> for v = 9 or 10. We construct such <b>partitions</b> for several sporadic orders, namely, Fano <b>partitions</b> for v = 14, 16, 22, 23, 28, and an affine <b>partition</b> for v = 18. Using these as starter <b>partitions,</b> we prove that Fano <b>partitions</b> exist for v = 7 (n) + 1, 13 (n) + 1, 27 (n) + 1, and affine <b>partitions</b> for v = 8 (n) + 1, 9 (n) + 1, 17 (n) + 1. In particular, both Fano and affine <b>partitions</b> exist for v = 3 (6 n) + 1.

The biggest exception among this group are the istiodactylids, which were likely primarily scavengers.|$|E
