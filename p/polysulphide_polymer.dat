40|$|Modification of an epoxy {{system with}} a {{conventional}} <b>polysulphide</b> <b>polymer,</b> while resulting in increased adhesion to difficult-to-bond substrates and improved durability, flexibility and impact resistance, also leads {{to a reduction in}} the epoxy glass transition temperature (T(g)), thereby lowering the upper service temperature, and low peel strength, limiting the material's application. The reduction in T(g) is due to reaction of the flexible, rubbery polysulphide into the epoxy/amine system, decreasing the overall rigidity of the matrix. However, if the polysulphide can be made to phase separate then these limitations may potentially be overcome. In this work the type of epoxy resin was kept constant and the effect of modifying the <b>polysulphide</b> <b>polymer</b> (rubber molecular weight, degree of branching, rubber end-group and level of rubber used) was investigated for systems cured with liquid amine or dicyandiamide curative. The new systems are shown to exhibit only a small reduction in the epoxy Tg while having improved peel strength and maintaining the greater lap shear strength expected of a polysulphide-modified material...|$|E
