40|$|AbstractA {{model for}} the {{evolution}} of mammalian cysteine <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> has been constructed on the basis of sequence homology. This model suggests that the diversity of cysteine <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> has evolved from two ancestral units forming the building blocks of stefin and cystatin. Gene triplication of the archetypal inhibitor generated the kininogen heavy chain which contains three cystatin-like copies. Hence, the superfamily of mammalian cysteine <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> is constituted by at least three distinct families, with stefin, cystatin and kininogen as their prototypes...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- <b>Proteinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are {{proteins}} {{widely distributed}} in plants.

We analyzed ring-, trophozoite-, schizont-, and merozoite-stage parasites by gelatin substrate PAGE and characterized the identified proteinases with class-specific <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> No <b>proteinase</b> activity was detected with rings. Trophozoites had a 28 kD proteinase that was inhibited by <b>inhibitors</b> of cysteine <b>proteinases.</b> Mature schizonts had a 35 - 40 kD proteinase that also was inhibited by cysteine <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Merozoite fractions had a 75 kD proteinase that was inhibited by serine <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> The stage-specific activity of these proteinases and {{the correlation between}} the effects of <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> on the isolated enzymes with the effects of the inhibitors on whole parasites suggest potential critical functions for these proteinases in the life cycle of malaria parasites...|$|R

40|$|The {{secreted}} Candida albicans aspartic proteinase (SAP) {{is presumed}} {{to be one of}} the putative Candida virulence factors, while serum <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> depend on host defense mechanisms. We examined the interaction between SAP and serum <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> such as C 1 -inhibitor, α 2 plasmin inhibitor, and antithrombin III. SAP progressively inactivated plasmin inhibitory activity of C 1 -inhibitor and α 2 plasmin inhibitor. It also inactivated thrombin inhibitory activity of antithrombin III. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, these host <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> were progressively degraded by SAP during prolonged incubation. These results suggest that SAP induces an imbalance of complements, coagulation and fibrinolytic systems through the degradation and inactivation of these host <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> and that SAP may play an important role in the development of Candida albicans infections...|$|R

50|$|Members of {{this family}} have a {{duplicated}} structure and generally possess two distinct inhibitory sites. These inhibitors are primarily found in plants and in particular in the seeds of legumes, {{as well as in}} cereal grains. In cereals, they exist in two forms, one of which is a duplication of the basic structure. Proteins of the Bowman-Birk inhibitor family of serine proteinase inhibitors interact with the enzymes they inhibit via an exposed surface loop that adopts the canonical proteinase inhibitory conformation. The resulting noncovalent complex renders the proteinase inactive. This inhibition mechanism is common for the majority of serine <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> proteins, and many analogous examples are known. A particular feature of the Bowman-Birk inhibitor protein, however, is that the interacting loop is a particularly well-defined, disulfide-linked, short beta-sheet region.|$|E
50|$|The insecticidal toxin {{from the}} {{bacterium}} Bacillus thuringiensis has been inserted into a tomato plant. When field tested they showed {{resistance to the}} tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta), tomato fruitworm (Heliothis zea), the tomato pinworm (Keiferia lycopersicella) and the tomato fruit borer (Helicoverpa armigera). A 91-day feeding trial in rats showed no adverse effects, but the Bt tomato has never been commercialised. Tomatoes resistant to a root knot nematode have been created by inserting a cysteine <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> gene from taro. A chemically synthesised ceropin B gene, usually found in the giant silk moth (Hyalophora cecropia), has been introduced into tomato plants and in vivo studies show significant resistance to bacterial wilt and bacterial spot. When the cell wall proteins, polygalacturonase and expansin are prevented from being produced in fruits, they are less susceptible to the fungus Botrytis cinerea than normal tomatoes. Pest resistant tomatoes can reduce the ecological footprint of tomato production {{while at the same}} time increase farm income.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the free-radical scavenging role, HA may also function in the negative feedback loop of inflammatory activation through its specific biological interactions with the biological constituents of inflammation. TNF-α, an important cytokine generated in inflammation, stimulates the expression of TSG-6 (TNF-stimulated gene 6) in fibroblasts and inflammatory cells. TSG-6, a HA-binding protein, also forms a stable complex with the serum <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> IαI (Inter-α-inhibitor) with a synergistic effect on the latter’s plasmin-inhibitory activity. Plasmin is involved in activation of the proteolytic cascade of matrix metalloproteinases and other proteinases leading to inflammatory tissue damage. Therefore, the action of TSG-6/ IαI complex, which may be additionally organized by binding to HA in the extracellular matrix, {{may serve as a}} potent negative feedback loop to moderate inflammation and stabilize the granulation tissue as healing progresses. In the murine air pouch model of carragenan/IL-1 (Interleukin-1β)-induced inflammation, where HA has been shown to have a proinflammatory property, reduction of inflammation can be achieved by administrating TSG-6, and the result is comparable with systemic dexamethasone treatment.|$|E

40|$|In {{organ culture}} experiments, the {{induction}} of pemphigus acantholysis {{is known to}} be blocked by the addition of serine <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Recently, nontoxic synthesized low molecular weight <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> have been clinically available for the treatment of disseminated intravascular co-agulation and pancreatitis. To determine if these drugs are useful aids to treat patients with pemphigus, we examined the effect of ω-guanidino ester analogues, i. e., 1) gabexate mesilate, 2) camostat mesilate, and 3) nafamostat mesilate, on experimental pemphigus acantholysis in both organ culture and neonatal BALB/c mice. Furthermore, the effect of plasma natural <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (alpha- 1 -proteinase in-hibitor) isolated from human plasma was similarly examined. Results revealed that synthesized low molecular weight inhibitors (drugs) were able to inhibit the induction of acantholysis in organ culture system, but had little or no effect on lesion formation in the neonatal mouse system. By contrast, alpha- 1 -proteinase inhibitor could completely inhibit acantholysis formation in mice. These findings implied a possible new therapeutic approach using <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> for patients with pemphigus...|$|R
5000|$|Granzyme B's {{most common}} {{inhibitor}} is SERPINB9 {{also known as}} <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> nine (PI-9) which is 376 amino acids long and found in the nucleus and cytoplasm.It is produced by many types of cell {{to protect themselves from}} accidental granzyme B mediated cell death. PI-9 is metastable and forms an energetically favourable conformation when bound to granzyme B. The reactive loop centre (RCL) of the PI-9 molecule acts as a pseudosubstrate and initially forms a reversible Michaelis complex. Once the peptide bond of the RCL is cleaved between positions P1 and P1', granzyme B is permanently inhibited.However, if the RCL is cleaved efficiently, PI-9 does not act as a 1:1 suicide substrate and granzyme B is left uninhibited. [...] Granzyme M can also cleave PI-9 in the nucleus and cytoplasm to relieve granzyme B of inhibition.Protein L4-100K from adenoviruses can also inhibit granzyme B by binding at exosites and specific binding pockets. L4-100K is an assembly protein that can transport hexon capsomeres into the nucleus of an adenovirus. 100k can be cleaved to a 90kDa fragment by granzyme H to relieve this inhibition which is important in adenovirus 5 infected cells.|$|E

In high school he competed in the Canada-Wide Science Fair in five {{successive}} years (1983-87), winning awards on each occasion and becoming one of the most highly awarded science fair participants {{in the history of the}} fair. In recognition of this he was selected to represent Canada as one of two youth delegates to the 1985 Nobel Prize lectures and ceremony in Stockholm, Sweden as part of the Stockholm International Youth Science Seminar and was awarded the International Youth Year Ontario Gold Medal.

5000|$|Pepstatin is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of aspartyl proteases. It is a hexa-peptide containing the unusual amino acid statine (Sta, (3S,4S)-4-amino-3-hydroxy-6-methylheptanoic acid), having the sequence Isovaleryl-Val-Val-Sta-Ala-Sta (Iva-Val-Val-Sta-Ala-Sta). [...] It was originally isolated from cultures of various species of Actinomyces due to its ability to inhibit pepsin at picomolar concentrations. Pepstatin A is well known to be an inhibitor of aspartic proteinases such as pepsin, cathepsins D and E. Except for {{its role as a}} <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> however, the pharmacological action of pepstatin A upon cells remain unclear. Pepstatin A suppresses receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation. Pepstatin A suppresses the formation of multinuclear osteoclasts dose-dependently. This inhibition of the formation only affected osteoclast cells, i.e., not osteoblast-like cells. Furthermore, pepstatin A also suppresses differentiation from pre-osteoclast cells to mononuclear osteoclast cells dose-dependently. This inhibition seems to be independent of the activities of proteinases such as cathepsin D, because the formation of osteoclasts was not suppressed with the concentration that inhibited the activity of cathepsin D. Cell signaling analysis indicated that the phosphorylation of ERK was inhibited in pepstatin A-treated cells, while the phosphorylation of IκB and Akt showed almost no change. Furthermore, pepstatin A decreased the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1). These results suggest that pepstatin A suppresses the differentiation of osteoclasts through the blockade of ERK signaling and the inhibition of NFATc1 expression.|$|E

5000|$|The alpha-macroglobulin (aM) {{family of}} {{proteins}} includes protease inhibitors, typified {{by the human}} tetrameric alpha-2-macroglobulin (a2M); they belong to the MEROPS <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> family I39, clan IL. These protease inhibitors share several defining properties, which include (i) the ability to inhibit proteases from all catalytic classes, (ii) {{the presence of a}} 'bait region' (aka. a sequence of amino acids in an α2-macroglobulin molecule, or a homologous protein, that contains scissile peptide bonds for those proteinases that it inhibits) and a thiol ester, (iii) a similar protease inhibitory mechanism and (iv) the inactivation of the inhibitory capacity by reaction of the thiol ester with small primary amines. aM protease inhibitors inhibit by steric hindrance. The mechanism involves protease cleavage of the bait region, a segment of the aM that is particularly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage, which initiates a conformational change such that the aM collapses about the protease. In the resulting aM-protease complex, the active site of the protease is sterically shielded, thus substantially decreasing access to protein substrates. Two additional events occur as a consequence of bait region cleavage, namely (i) the h-cysteinyl-g-glutamyl thiol ester becomes highly reactive and (ii) a major conformational change exposes a conserved COOH-terminal receptor binding domain [...] (RBD). RBD exposure allows the aM protease complex to bind to clearance receptors and be removed from circulation. Tetrameric, dimeric, and, more recently, monomeric aM protease inhibitors have been identified.|$|E
40|$|Three {{different}} serine proteinase inhibitors {{were isolated}} from rat serum and purified to apparent homogeneity. One of the inhibitors {{appears to be}} homologous to alpha 1 -proteinase inhibitor isolated from man and other species, but the other two, designated rat <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> I and rat <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> II, seem to have no human counterpart. alpha 1 -Proteinase inhibitor (Mr 55000) inhibits trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase, the three serine proteinases tested. Rat <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> I (Mr 66000) is active towards trypsin and chymotrypsin, but is inactive towards elastase. Rat <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> II (Mr 65000) is an effective inhibitor of trypsin only.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{isolation}} from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) of an ethylene-responsive {{member of the}} <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> gene family. DNA sequence analysis of a full-length cDNA clone indicates that the ethylene-responsive gene is distantly related to the tomato <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> I gene, having 53 % sequence identity. The predicted amino acid sequence reveals 47 % and 45 % sequence identity with the tomato and potato <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> I polypeptides, respectively. Additionally, the ethylene-responsive inhibitor has evolved a completely different pattern of gene expression and inhibitory specificity than {{other members of the}} inhibitor I family. Gel blot hybridization experiments show that, unlike the tomato <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> I gene, it is not induced in wounded leaves. In contrast, it is activated by the plant hormone ethylene in leaves and during fruit ripening. Furthermore, the ethylene-responsive inhibitor exhibits a novel reactive site, having glutamic acid as the P 1 residue. This suggests that the ethylene-responsive <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> does not react with chymotrypsin, as does <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> I, but that it reacts with proteolytic enzymes that cleave at glutamic residues, such as the Staphylococcus aureus V 8 proteinase, for which no inhibitors are known. Finally, isolation and analysis of a genomic clone reveals that the ethylene-responsive <b>proteinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> gene is tightly linked to another, yet unidentified, coordinately expressed gene.
