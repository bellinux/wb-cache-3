In simulated stands, density-dependent neighborhood heterogeneity caused variability in the growth rate of individuals with the same size, and such variability caused skewness to increase with time.

In experimental stands of Fraxinus mandshurica in China, skewness and inequality increased with density and age.

50|$|Societal factors (such {{as family}} structure, parental style and monitoring) {{play a role}} in the type and {{timeline}} of sexual behaviour. The family <b>is</b> <b>an</b> important structure in the adolescent's life; it provides values and beliefs about marriage, love and sex, and is the base of the relationships that they will have in later life. Parental monitoring and communication are essential. Parent-child communication “about sex also was significantly and negatively associated with consistent versus inconsistent condom use”. The composition of the household plays a critical role in adolescent sexuality. Adolescents from single-parent households (mostly single mothers) are more likely to engage in premarital sex than adolescents from two-parent households. Coley, Medeiros and Schindler investigated the impact of family on adolescent sexual behaviour, concluding that “regular family activities may buffer adolescents, whereas negative parenting behaviors may increase adolescents' engagement in sexual risk behaviors”. <b>Parents</b> <b>are</b> both <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of information about sexual behaviour and models of what is accepted and what is not. The neighbourhood is another societal factor; it has been found that the “neighborhood context may be positively or negatively associated with sexual initiation, depending on gender”.

40|$|This diploma paper {{studies the}} {{experience}} of adolescents and their parents where the adolescents were redirected from the regular school program into the Adapted program of education with lower educational standard. Individuals with mild intellectual disability are typically characterised by reduced learning abilities, but in the adapted learning environment {{they are able to}} achieve basic school aims. Due to extensive learning difficulties such students are unable to follow the regular school program, which is why they are schooled, or are later redirected into the Adapted program of education with lower educational standard. If the students are redirected later, learning difficulties and failure in the field of education increase, which can cause behavioural and emotional problems, as well as have an important role on students' self-respect. Due to constant failure the students may develop fear of school, and consequently dislike of learning or of school in general. Emotional tension and distress related to school can cause psychosomatic problems or disorders in students. But learning failure extends beyond the scope of student's perception of school alone. It also affects how students spend their free time and their social relations in the broader and narrow environment. This research studies four students, who were redirected into the Adapted program of education with lower educational standard. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> case study which provides an insight into {{the experience of}} parents and their children in the process of redirection into the above mentioned program. To obtain the research data we used the half-structured interview. The interviews were recorded and transcribed.

The research shows that the students felt unsuccessful in the regular school, having difficulties in their relations with peers and teachers, as well as {{spending a lot of time}} for their school work. Their parents’ observations were similar, reporting about various behavioural and emotional problems of their children. After the redirection both the students and their parents noted that they had less learning difficulties, the students' well-being improved along with their attitude to school and relations with teachers and students. This research can help understand the problems of students with learning difficulties that are, despite effort and assistance, unable to achieve minimal learning standards.

50|$|Some of the {{key factors}} that affect mental health in Asian Americans include acculturation, {{language}} barriers among parents and children, and intergenerational conflict. Acculturation describes the physical and psychological changes that occur when two cultures meet and encompasses the changes that occur when immigrants and refugees assimilate into a new culture. Immigration to {{a country with a}} vastly different culture can <b>be</b> consider <b>a</b> stressful life event that leads to culture shock, migration shock, and acculturative stress. Frequently diagnosed disorders in recent immigrants include depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and schizophrenia, though the rate of incidence of mental health problems decreases with increased assimilation and time in a new country. Refugees from Southeast Asian countries like Cambodia and Laos also experience high rates of PTSD from war traumas and resettlement stressors. Varying English proficiency among immigrant Asian <b>parents</b> can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of conflict between parents and children. One study shows that in immigrant Chinese families, the level of English proficiency in the parental generation correlates with indicators of child and adolescent psychological well-being.

This serves as <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of stress and psychological duress for American adolescents, as they are socialized into the host culture while still expected to maintain their parents’ heritage.|$|R
40|$|Males {{and females}} may make {{distinctly}} different contributions to parental care. In cichlid fishes, females typically care for embryos while males guard territories. Parent-offspring contact may enhance transmission of beneficial microbes. Microbial sharing between group members <b>is</b> <b>a</b> potential {{mechanism for the}} evolution of social behavior (Lombardo 2007). Parental care is unusual among teleost (bony) fishes, but is ubiquitous among the cichlid fishes, and convict cichlids (Archocentrus nigrofaciatus) exhibit biparental care. We (1) quantified the parental behavior of males and females to determine whether they differed in amount or type of physical contact with their offspring; (2) collected samples of parental slime coats, embryos, and fry to compare the microbes associated with each, comparing samples from subsets of broods receiving parental care to others where parental contact was prevented. Females touched embryos significantly more often than males, but physical contact with fry is much less common and initiated by fry rather than parents. To date, molecular data support our prediction that fry receiving parental care bear microbes more similar to female vs. male parents, and to parents vs. siblings that did not receive care. Assuming this trend continues in subsequent samples, we conclude that <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> <b>an</b> important <b>source</b> of microbial inocula and that female contact during immobile developmental stages is especially important for microbial transmission...|$|R

We investigated the associations between parents’ supply of alcohol, their attitudes concerning the supply of alcohol (personal norms), and their beliefs about other parents’ attitudes and behavior (injunctive and descriptive social norms). Method: <b>A</b> web-based survey <b>was</b> completed by 490 parents of 12 - to 18 -year-olds from Australia (n = 251) and Canada (n = 239). Path analysis was used to test a conceptual model of the relationships between social norm constructs and supply of alcohol at home and for unsupervised consumption. Results: Personal norms were {{the most important factor in}} parents’ decisions to supply alcohol to adolescents for consumption both at home and in unsupervised settings. Descriptive and injunctive proximal norms were directly associated with supply of alcohol at home. Injunctive and descriptive proximal norms were indirectly associated with unsupervised supply through their positive association with personal norm. Conclusions: The path models identify personal norms relating to adolescent alcohol consumption as the variable most strongly associated with decisions to supply alcohol to adolescents both at home and in unsupervised settings, with associations between injunctive and descriptive norms operating via this pathway. Proximal norms have a more powerful influence on parents’ personal norms than do distal norms. These associations have important implications for the design of interventions to reduce parental supply of alcohol and adolescent risky drinking...|$|R

These difficulties were further underlined by retrospective analysis of IGRF- 10 SV candidates centered in 2007.5 which differed by 20 to 30 nT/yr from the retrospective IGRF- 11 estimate for the same interval.

The findings clearly suggest a relationship between parenting self-efficacy and parenting stress; <b>parents</b> who <b>are</b> feeling less efficacious experience higher levels of stress, whereas greater <b>parenting</b> self-efficacy <b>is</b> related to less stress. This study adds to the evidence that <b>parent</b> outcomes may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> more reliable measure of programme effectiveness than child outcomes at least in the short term...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Most {{adolescents}} begin {{alcohol consumption}} during adolescence, heavy alcohol use by adolescents is common, and alcohol-related harm amongst adolescents <b>is</b> <b>a</b> major public health burden. <b>Parents</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> common <b>source</b> of alcohol amongst adolescents, but {{little is known}} about how parental supply of alcohol has changed over recent years. This study examines national trends in parental supply of alcohol to adolescent children in Australia since 1998. Methods Six Australian National Drug Strategy Household Surveys (1998 – 2013) yielded rates of parental supply of current and first ever alcohol consumed. Lifetime and current alcohol use were also estimated. The surveys were conducted for households across all Australian states and territories. Surveyed adolescents were aged 14 – 17 years (N[*]=[*] 7357, 47. 6  % male). Measures included the reported source of currently consumed alcohol and first ever alcoholic beverage (parents/friends/others), lifetime alcohol use, number of standard alcohol units consumed on drinking days, and frequency of alcohol use. Corrected Pearson chi-squared tests were used to compare survey years. Results There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> significant drop in parental supply of current alcohol use from 21. 3  % in 2004 to 11. 79  % in 2013 (p[*]<[*]. 001). The lower prevalence of parental supply coincided with legislative changes on parental supply of alcohol to adolescents, but causality cannot be established because of the variation in the timing and reach of parental supply legislation, and small samples in some states. There were downward trends in adolescent experimentation, quantity and frequency of alcohol use across years, with the largest drop in alcohol use in 2010 and 2013. Conclusions In Australia, there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> substantial reduction in parental supply of alcohol to adolescents from 2010, and this factor may partially account for reductions in adolescent alcohol use...|$|R
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 2005 Monica Clare HodderWhat perceptions do Year Three children aged 8 - 10 years have about the world of work? This study was initiated because, as a parent and teacher I had noticed that some children are motivated more than others to study {{in the pursuit of}} a career. Most of the research on the career development of young children is {{based on the work of}} Gottfredson’s developmental model (1981) in North America it has not been established previously whether this model applies to Australian children. The findings of this study confirm Gottfredson’s theory about children’s capacity to make tentative career choices. Parents, teachers and the media all influence children’s career aspirations in varying degrees. Although parents play a role in assisting their children to gain knowledge about occupational preferences children do not necessarily follow their parents in the same occupational interests. <b>Parents</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> good <b>source</b> of career education for their offspring. While children have some idea about the hierarchical nature of occupational work, they are still unclear as to specific aspects of the supervisory role. As with adults generally, children appear to have limited knowledge about the specific tasks related to particular occupations. It appears from this study that the most common way children access occupational information is through the media. The implications from this investigative study are that children will benefit from greater access to career education, commencing as early as primary school. In order to make realistic future occupational selections children win benefit from having more specific information regarding occupational tasks. It therefore follows that teachers need to be made aware or these implications and plan relevant curricula to address the specific needs or students. It is also evident that parents could assist this process by making themselves available to clearly discuss their work roles with their children. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Family and {{parenthood}} {{are very}} important for healthy development of a child. Positive parenthood is crucial for child's growth and development into independent personality. At the same time, parenthood includes effort and concerns that are more common in parenting twins. The thesis discusses the field of parenting twins, which differs for parenting the only child and has certain specifics. In the theoretical part I touched upon {{the importance of a}} family and parenthood for a healthy child development, the confrontation with a role of a parent and the preparation for a birth of twins. I got familiar with Slovenian Parenthood and Family Earnings Act. The empirical part is based on four interviews of parents of twins. I analyzed their answers and connected them with literature and interpreted them. According to the answers of interviewed parents, different perceptions of parenting twins among <b>parents</b> <b>were</b> shown. Analysis showed different condition from expected. It turned out that parents of twins do not feel discriminated, furthermore their conditions, in terms of <b>parenting</b> twins, <b>are</b> not so dramatic. The research represents a contribution to Slovene literature in the field of <b>parenting</b> twins and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of information and experiences for future parents of twins...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To explore whether {{changes in}} {{parenting}} self-efficacy after attending <b>a</b> <b>parenting</b> programme <b>are</b> related {{to changes in}} parenting stress and child behaviour. Background: Adverse <b>parenting</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> risk factor {{in the development of}} a range of health and behavioural problems in childhood and is predictive of poor adult outcomes. Strategies for supporting <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> recognised as <b>an</b> effective way to improve the health, well-being and development of children. <b>Parenting</b> <b>is</b> influenced by many factors including the behaviour and characteristics of the child, the health and psychological well-being of the parent and the contextual influences of stress and support. <b>Parenting</b> difficulties <b>are</b> <b>a</b> major <b>source</b> of stress for parents, and <b>parenting</b> self-efficacy has <b>been</b> shown to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> important buffer against parenting stress. Methods: In all, 63 parents who had a child under the age of 10 years took part in the research. Of those, 58 returned completed measures of parenting self-efficacy, parenting stress and child behaviour at the start of a parenting programme and 37 at three-month follow-up. Findings: Improvements in parenting self-efficacy and <b>parenting</b> stress <b>were</b> found at follow-up, but there was less evidence for improvements in child behaviour. The findings clearly suggest a relationship between parenting self-efficacy and parenting stress; <b>parents</b> who <b>are</b> feeling less efficacious experience higher levels of stress, whereas greater <b>parenting</b> self-efficacy <b>is</b> related to less stress.

The management of urban stormwater runoff <b>is</b> <b>an</b> important issue throughout Tennessee as urban development keeps expanding. With the rise of urban development, there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> ever-growing need for urban stormwater management systems and facilities which are built to protect downstream property owners from potential flood damage as well as to manage and control the increased stormwater runoff. However well-designed a drainage system or facility might be, adequate maintenance is vital for it to function as intended by the design engineer. This thesis was written to serve as a document that provides information needed to support an effective maintenance program for urban stormwater management systems and facilities and includes information that can help educate both public and private owners of these systems and facilities about the importance...|$|R
