The algal and foraminiferal Lower Coralline Limestone was probably deposited in shallow water. The prominent Scutella Bed resembles a near-surface shell bank. Two <b>phosphatic</b> <b>nodule</b> beds, possibly marking stagnant periods, separate the Globigerina Limestones. The lower and upper divisions are formed of pelagic foraminifera with lamellibranchs and neritic echinoids. The middle division, a marly limestone, {{may be a}} deep of water deposit but has an upper, coarser facies in south-west Gozo. The Lower and Middle Globigerina Limestones thin eastward and the latter is absent {{over much of the}} eastern area where the nodule beds coalesce. The Upper Globigerina Limestone— Blue Clay boundary, despite sane previous opinions, is always sharp. The two beds have faunal similarities, their lithological differences are probably caused by a sudden onset of mud deposition. Variations in, thickness of the Blue Clay are considered to have an erosional origin.

40|$|International audienceThe {{exceptional}} {{record of}} well-preserved wood remains from the Middle Jurassic of Svalbard is studied from the taphonomic point of view. These remains were {{recovered from the}} Brentskardhaugen Bed, a conglomerate with <b>phosphatic</b> <b>nodules,</b> which constitutes {{the record of the}} eroded deposits corresponding to the Toarcian-Early Bathonian gap. The wood remains occur in the cores of these nodules. These wood fragments are preserved as phosphate (francolite) and as charcoals. The well preservation allows us to identify xenoxyloid cross-field pits and xenoxylean pitting on the radial wall of tracheid, characterizing the species Xenoxylon phyllocladoides. <b>Phosphatic</b> <b>nodules</b> originated as the result of early phosphate precipitation filling the inter-particle pore space of the sandy quartz sediment around the wood fragments (and other organic-rich nucleation centers) below the sediment-water interface. This phosphatization involved a sudden burial of the wood remains in the sea-bottom, the subsequent decay of the lignin, and a fast growth of carbonate fluorapatite forming phosphatic inner moulds. Fossil microbial biofilms induced the phosphatization. The dissolution/decay of the lignin is not possible in charcoal, and phosphatic casts did not develop in charcoalified parts. Some remains were not totally charred, with the lignin preserved only in reduced relicts that were later replaced by phosphate. The phosphate precipitation occurred in recurrent episodes during the Toarcian-Callovian as a result of distinct sea-level rises and the associated nutrification of the shelf.

Poor swimming ability may have made hatchling turtles easy prey that could have been either swallowed whole or processed by shake feeding. Ingestion of bird remains probably occurred through scavenging. Opportunistic feeding on vertebrates is at odds with existing interpretations of dietary habits in Cretaceous ichthyosaurs, which favour predation primarily upon cephalopods. Such specialization is considered a contributing factor in the group's ultimate extinction. However, the evidence here that at least some forms were able to use a wide range of available food types suggests that the decline of ichthyosaurs in the mid-Cretaceous may be linked to other factors such as competition with ecologically analogous pursuit predators...|$|R

60|$|To the {{question}} {{why we do}} not find records of these vast primordial periods, I can give no satisfactory answer. Several of the most eminent geologists, with Sir E.

Forbes, dispute this conclusion. We should not forget that {{only a small portion of}} the world is known with accuracy. M. Barrande has lately added another and lower stage to the Silurian system, abounding with new and peculiar species. Traces of life have been detected in the Longmynd beds, beneath Barrande's so-called primordial zone. The presence of <b>phosphatic</b> <b>nodules</b> and bituminous matter in some of the lowest azoic rocks, probably indicates the former existence of life at these periods. But the difficulty of understanding the absence of vast piles of fossiliferous strata, which on my theory no doubt were somewhere accumulated before the Silurian epoch, is very great. If these most ancient beds had been wholly worn away by denudation, or obliterated by metamorphic action, we ought to find only small remnants of the formations next succeeding them in age, and these ought to be very generally in a metamorphosed condition. But the descriptions which we now possess of the Silurian deposits over immense territories in Russia and in North America, do not support the view, that the older a formation is, the more it has always suffered the extremity of denudation and metamorphism.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{and highlights}} {{the history of}} descriptive genus-level taxonomy on Paleozoic radiolarians grouped in five major phases: 1) initial discoveries in the 1890 s; 2) ignored {{during the first half}} of the 1900 s; 3) renewed interest during the 1950 s to 1970 s; 4) the “fast” years of the late 1970 s to 1990 s; and 5) the early 21 st century quest for the oldest and significant progress in the late Permian. In the 1890 s, radiolarians were identified with certainty by Hinde in Ordovician radiolarian cherts. Following Hinde’s great discovery, and after a 50 -year dormant period, Deflandre revived the study of Paleozoic radiolarians through his groundbreaking study of Albaillella from Carboniferous <b>phosphatic</b> <b>nodules,</b> combined with his genius for understanding evolutionary implications. Additional important work was conducted in this third phase by Foreman, particularly with respect to the description of the radiolarian internal structures based on material extracted from Devonian carbonate nodules. The late 1970 s saw an expansion in studies that made extensive use of the SEM for the description of Paleozoic radiolarians, many of which had been extracted from chert using HF methods. The potential of radiolarians to unveil the structure and geodynamic evolution of Paleozoic orogenic belts stimulated taxonomic interest during the 1980 s and 1990 s, a prerequisite for the elaboration of radiolarian biostratigraphic schemes, which was successfully achieved for the upper Paleozoic. The fifth phase follows the discovery of well-preserved Middle Cambrian radiolarians from Australia at the end of the 20 th century and subsequent description by Won of beautifully preserved Cambrian and Ordovician fauna from western Newfoundland. Research on early Paleozoic radiolarians was the main driver for the increase of the number of new genera for the last two decades...|$|R

The Semicostatum-Turneri Zones are composed of non expanding clays; the smectite formed by erosion of previously exposed alkaline igneous rocks under warm, alkaline, low rainfall conditions. Progressive transgression covered the source area and a change to more acidic conditions with higher rainfall also promoted the formation of "ironstones" and chlorites. The Angulata and Bucklandi Zones comprise bioclastic, oolitic, carbonate and siliciclastic sediments signifying shallow marginal marine semi-enclosed basins. Thin laterally impersistent beds of coarse,poorly sorted pebbles signify an unstable hinterland; during the Semicostatum and Turneri Zones fully marine conditions were established. Ferruginous beds are oolitic in Skye. They probably formed as "mud balls" and due to acid leaching of feldspars. <b>Phosphatic</b> <b>nodules</b> are calciumhydroxyapatite. The limestone/shale "rhythms" are explained by a combined primary and diagenetic origin. The limestones consist of low-Mg calcite Both ferroan and non ferroan calcite are present. Tectonic stresses and diagenesis deformed crystals and formed veins. Sr + 2 values show a decline as the carbonate fraction increases. Three different ranges are distinguished for three facies and ages. Sr concentration is bimodal and probably inherited from the original sediments. The northern and southern basins evolved separately, sedimentation was controlled by differential tilting, uplift and subsidence. Palaeoslopes were gentle, to the west-northwest and south-southwest. Local topography (e. g. Central Strath High) modified the slopes; no movement occurred along the main faults of the area. Sedimentation relates to the "taphrogenic rifting stage" proposed for the North Sea Mesozoic. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Late Cretaceous Duwi Formation in Egypt overlies non-marine, varicolored shale of {{the middle}} Campanian Quseir Formation. It is {{conformably}} overlain by gray, laminated, foraminiferal-rich marine shale {{of the middle}} Maastrichtian Dakhla Formation. Detailed mineralogical and geochemical {{studies were carried out}} on the phosphate rocks of the Duwi Formation in Quseir-Safaga province (Geble Duwi Mine) to infer their source rocks, paleo-weathering and provenance of the sources. The importance of the effect of phosphate rock depends on the chemical form of phosphorus in which this element is combined. This information is important in the assessment of possible radiological hazards to human health; due to the presence of uranium in the apatite structure. The phosphatic rock materials may be used as building stones or as phosphatic fertilizers and animal feed ingredients. Mineralogically, they are composed mainly of apatite (fluor-apatite), calcite and quartz with minor amounts of pyrite. The studied Duwi phosphates are authigenic in origin, comparable to those of <b>phosphatic</b> <b>nodules</b> of Peru and Chile margins. They are most probably derived from pre-existing authigenic phosphorites. Provenance, they originate from reworked older sedimentary phosphorites and biogenic sources. The geochemical data, CIA values suggested that the Duwi Formation phosphates were subjected to low chemical weathering. Generally, the enrichment of the trace elements, REEs and uranium may have occurred during diagenesis. The studied phosphate samples were compared to the average of the Average World Phosphorite (AWP) and the Average Shale Composition (ASC). The major, trace and rare earth elements contents are compared with those in Egypt, North African, Asian and other localities. The ratios V/Cr, V/(V+Ni) and Mo/Al and the high concentrations of the redox sensitive elements revealed that the studied phosphates were deposited under anoxic reducing marine environments coupled with hydrothermal solutions, which is comparable to the environmental condition of the associated black shales. The concentration of the trace and toxic elements in the studied samples are considered to be below the limits for most field-grown crops...|$|R

Association of the deposits with more or less altered basaltic rock can be observed. On the Pernambuco Plateau and Ceara Guyot, ferromanganese deposits occur associated with <b>phosphatic</b> material and <b>nodules.</b> The mineralogical composition of the ferromanganese deposits indicates a predominance of the manganese oxide phase dMnO 2. Low contents of Mn and Cu are characteristic of their chemical composition. Fe and Mn in the deposits probably precipitated from the sea water...|$|R
40|$|Manganese-rich {{sedimentary}} rocks are exposed intermittently throughout {{an area of}} 40, 000 km² in the Avalon Zone in southeastern Newfoundland. Paleontological data indicate that the manganese-rich rocks form a stratiform deposit of basal Middle Cambrian age and that the manganese horizon is related to a disconformity whose duration increases from south to north. Stratigraphic measurements and chemical analyses show that the manganese horizon becomes thinner (from 25 to 1 m) and progressively enriched in Mn relative to Fe (Mn/Fe from <l to ≃ 3. 0) towards the north as {{the magnitude of the}} disconformity increases. The manganese horizon is enriched in Mn, Fe, Mg, Ba, and P relative to enclosing red and green mudrocks. [...] Petrographic study of manganese horizon samples shows that the horizon is fossiliferous, containing a fauna which includes trilobites and algal structures. Most of the manganese is present in carbonate minerals (rhodochrosite and manganiferous calcite), although secondary manganese oxide minerals also occur. In part, the manganese horizon contains anomalous concentrations of Fe-rich chlorite (chamosite). <b>Phosphatic</b> <b>nodules</b> and euhedral crystals of barite and pyrite are also present in some manganese horizon samples. Carbonate nodules are abundant and these are believed to have been formed during diagenesis. [...] The available evidence suggests that the manganese accumulated slowly in shallow marine waters in a partially restricted basin during a break in normal sedimentation characterized by reduced rates of clastic sedimentation. The manganese was originally precipitated in oxide form, with subsequent alteration during early diagenesis producing the manganese carbonate which now characterizes the horizon. The Mn was derived from the weathering of Late Precambrian rock assemblages exposed around the Middle Cambrian basin. Mn was separated from Fe during transportation of the Mn. towards the north within the partially restricted basin. In this regard, the restricted rate of clastic sedimentation is critical, as it permitted the gradual transportation and concentration of manganese at a given site {{over long periods of time}} with no dilution by clastic minerals. [...] The shallow marine origin, the stable tectonic environment, the manganese carbonate mineralogy, and the pronounced influence of diagenesis upon the rocks suggest similarities between the Newfoundland manganese horizon and modern oceanic ferromanganese deposits of the diagenetic type (Rona et al., 1978; Bonatti et al., 1972) and with the Nicopol Formation type of ancient deposit (Varentzov, 1964). Manganese-rich rocks of basal Middle Cambrian age present in the Harlech Dome region in North Wales are stratigraphically, tectonically, and chemically similar to the Newfoundland manganese horizon (Mohr, 1966) and may be correlative with the latter...|$|R
40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. The {{consideration of the}} Southern Adelaide Fold Belt as a foreland fold and thrust belt has been proposed {{as a solution to}} stratigraphic problems related to both the dramatic change in style of sedimentation between the Cambrian Kanmantoo and Normanville Groups, and the unusual thickness of the Kanmantoo Group. It was proposed by Jenkins (1990) that the Kanmantoo Group may be thickened by thrust stacking. Structural investigations by Steinhardt (1989) and this study have concentrated on finding evidence for the presence of such thrusts and measurement of any stratigraphic offsets. Structural mapping along the south coast of the Fleurieu Peninsula of part of the Kanmantoo Group type section within the Blowhole Creek area has revealed at least one major complex thrust zone associated with the easternmost exposure of the Talisker Calc Siltstone. Imbricate faulting within this zone displays unexpected normal sense stratigraphic offsets. This was observed at Blowhole Creek, in association with with a previously unknown exposure of Talisker Calc Siltstone. The Blowhole Creek section appears to be more highly deformed than previously described, a set of tight overturned folds being discovered as part of what was once thought to be the relatively undeformed limb of an overturned regional anticline. At least two major anticlinal structures are present between Cooalinga Creek and Deep Creek Conservation Park, not the single anticline previously accepted. Due to the lack of strain markers strain analysis was restricted to measurement of elongate <b>phosphatic</b> <b>nodules</b> within the Heatherdale Shale and shortening measurements of mesoscopic and microscopic folding. Rf/phi analysis revealed that the three dimensional shape of the strain ellipsoid varied on different limbs of the sampled regional anticline. The Rf/phi analysis also revealed that the amount of tectonic flattening does not significantly differ from one side of this structure to the other, hence any thinning of stratigraphic units on the overturned limbs of major fold structures must be due mostly to variations in original depositional thicknesses. Stratigraphic units were observed to thin towards the west, the Blowhole Creek Siltstone Member and the Campana Creek Member thinning to nothing on the western overturned limb of the regional anticline. Restored sections revealed that the total shortening along a cross section of the whole Blowhole Creek area is in the order of 66 percent. Studies of microscopic kinematic indicators revealed an east over west sense of shear for faults and shear zones within the Blowhole Creek area. Late stage deformation has produced two sets of kinks within the Blowhole Creek area. Two veins sets and a set of mafic dykes are also present. Thesis (B. Sc.

50|$|Geology of Surrey. Towards the {{beginning}} of the Cretaceous age (146-66 million years ago) Surrey alternated between a fresh-to-brackish water embayment depositing Hastings Beds and Weald Clay, comprising shales and mudstones that are often finely banded. Offshore muds (now shales and mudstones) of the Atherfield Clay were deposited followed by shallow marine sands of the Hythe, Sandgate and Folkestone Beds. Where not eroded to lower heights, there is then a marine layer of the sands of the Hythe Beds topped by chert seen on today's remaining Greensand Hills. Instead of the mudstone and sandstone-producing three beds mentioned before Hythe Beds, west of Dorking the marine Bargate Beds made of calcareous (chalk and limestone-rich) sandstone were deposited. The Folkestone Beds contain <b>phosphatic</b> and iron-rich <b>nodules,</b> which locally yield a rich fossil fauna of marine shells.|$|R
