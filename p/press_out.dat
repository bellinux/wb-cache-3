Diderot did his best to recover his piece, but never succeeded.[43] A copy of it came into the hands of Naigeon, and it seems to have been retained by Malesherbes, the director of the <b>press,</b> <b>out</b> of goodwill to the author.

60|$|And, more damnable still, the poetical {{essence of}} the legend, the {{identification}} of Proserpine's twofold existence with the grand alternation of nature's seasons, has been entirely neglected by the author. Surely his work, though published, is quite as deservedly obscure as Mrs. Shelley's derelict manuscript. Midas has the privilege, if it be one, of not challenging any obvious comparison. The subject, since Lyly's and Dryden's days, has hardly {{attracted the attention of}} the poets. It was so eminently fit for the lighter kinds of presentation that the agile bibliographer who aimed at completeness would {{have to go through a}} fairly long list of masques, [Footnote: There is one by poor Christopher Smart.] comic operas, or 'burlettas', all dealing with the ludicrous misfortunes of the Phrygian king. But an examination of these would be sheer pedantry in this place. Here again Mrs. Shelley has stuck to her Latin source as closely as she could. [Footnote: Perhaps her somewhat wearying second act, on the effects of the gold-transmuting gift, would have been shorter, if Ovid (Metam. xi. 108-30) had not himself gone into such details on the subject.] She has made a gallant attempt to connect the two stories with which Midas has ever since Ovid's days been associated, and a distinct--indeed a too perceptible--effort to <b>press</b> <b>out</b> a moral meaning in this, as she had easily extricated a cosmological meaning in the other tale.|$|E

60|$|The {{press was}} {{employed}} {{in one of}} the processes of the photographic manufacture, but the nature of the process it did not concern Denton to understand. The most salient fact to his mind was {{that it had to be}} conducted in ruby light, and as a consequence the room in which he worked was lit by one coloured globe that poured a lurid and painful illumination about the room. In the darkest corner stood the press whose servant Denton had now become: it was a huge, dim, glittering thing with a projecting hood that had a remote resemblance to a bowed head, and, squatting like some metal Buddha in this weird light that ministered to its needs, it seemed to Denton in certain moods almost as if this must needs be the obscure idol to which humanity in some strange aberration had offered up his life. His duties had a varied monotony. Such items as the following will convey an idea of the service of the press. The thing worked with a busy clicking so long as things went well; but if the paste that came pouring through a feeder from another room and which it was perpetually compressing into thin plates, changed in quality the rhythm of its click altered and Denton hastened to make certain adjustments. The slightest delay involved a waste of paste and the docking of one or more of his daily pence. If the supply of paste waned--there were hand processes of a peculiar sort involved in its preparation, and sometimes the workers had convulsions which deranged their output--Denton had to throw the <b>press</b> <b>out</b> of gear. In the painful vigilance a multitude of such trivial attentions entailed, painful because of the incessant effort its absence of natural interest required, Denton had now to pass one-third of his days. Save for an occasional visit from the manager, a kindly but singularly foul-mouthed man, Denton passed his working hours in solitude.|$|E
6000|$|Thus {{what was}} printed of the correspondence, {{and what was}} not printed, concur to show that Pope {{must have been the}} source from which it was derived. The history of the {{circumstances}} under which the publication took place will confirm this inference. Pope asserted that the quarto was [...] "copied from an impression sent from Dublin." [...] There is now proof in abundance that the Dublin edition, which came out as the seventh volume of Swift's works, was copied from an impression sent from England. Mr. Deane Swift, a cousin of his famous namesake, and the son-in-law of Mrs. Whiteway, informed Mr. Nichols, in 1778, that [...] "he was the only person then living who could give a full account how Faulkner's seventh volume, that is, how Swift's and Pope's correspondence came to be, not first printed, but first published in Ireland."[142] The italics are Mr. Swift's own, and the fact on which he laid such especial emphasis is at once attested and explained by the statement of Faulkner himself to Dr. Birch in August, 1749. [...] "Mr. Pope," [...] he said, [...] "sent to Ireland to Dr. Swift, by Mr. Gerrard, an Irish gentleman, then at Bath, a printed copy of their letters, with an anonymous letter, which occasioned Dr. Swift to give Mr. Faulkner leave to reprint them at Dublin, though Mr. Pope's edition was published first."[143] Faulkner also solicited the sanction of Pope, and we have the poet's summary of the application, in the letter he wrote to Mr. Nugent on August 14, 1740: [...] "Last week I received an account from Faulkner, the Dublin bookseller, that the Dean himself has given him a collection of letters of his own and mine, and others, to be printed, and he civilly asks my consent, assuring me the Dean declares them genuine, and that Mr. Swift, Mrs. Whiteway's son-in-law, will correct the <b>press,</b> <b>out</b> of his great respect to the Dean and myself. He says they were collected by some unknown persons, and the copy sent with a letter importing that it was criminal to suppress such an amiable picture of the Dean, and his private character appearing in those letters, and that if he would not publish them in his lifetime others would after his death." [...] It is manifest from these particulars that Faulkner was not then aware that Pope himself had sent the correspondence to Swift, and the conviction was only forced upon his mind by subsequent events. But the bookseller could not be mistaken on the point that the letters were handed to him in print. As he later told Dr. Birch that the Dean had given him leave to reprint them because they were printed already, so he proclaimed that his volume was a reprint at the time. He inserted {{at the end of his}} first edition the few new letters which were added in the quarto of 1741, and says that he found them in the London impression [...] "after he had reprinted the foregoing sheets." [...] Faulkner had no sort of motive to deceive. Whether the letters were in type or in manuscript he had equally received them from Swift, and obtained his authority to publish them.|$|E
6000|$|Your {{impulse to}} steep me, and hold me down under water, in the Fountain of Youth, with Charles Boyd muscularly to help you, {{is no less}} {{beautiful}} than the expression you have given it, by which I am more touched than I can tell you. I take {{it as one of}} your constant kindnesses--but I had, all the same, I fear, taken Filson Young's Invidious Epithet (in that little compliment) as inevitable, wholly, though I believe it was mainly applied to my voice. My voice was on that Centenary itself Centenarian--for reasons that couldn't be helped--for I really that day wasn't fit to speak. As for one's own sense of antiquity, my own, what is one to say?--it varies, goes and comes; at times isn't there at all and at others is quite sufficient, thank you! I cultivate not thinking about it--and yet in certain ways I like it, like the sense of having {{had a great deal of}} life. The young, on the whole, make me pretty sad--the old themselves don't. But the pretension to youth is a thing that makes me saddest and oldest of all; the acceptance of the fact that I am all the while growing older on the other hand decidedly rejuvenates me; I say [...] "what then?" [...] and the answer doesn't come, there doesn't seem to be any, and that quite sets me up. So I am young enough--and you are magnificent, simply: I get from you the sense of an inexhaustible vital freshness, and your voice is the voice (so beautiful!) of your twentieth year. Your going to America was admirably young--an act of your twenty-fifth. Don't be younger than that; don't seem a year younger than you do seem; for in that case you will have quite withdrawn from my side. Keep up with me a little. I shall come to see you again at no distant day, but the coming week seems to have got itself pretty well encumbered, and on the 24th or 26th I go to Rye for four or five days. After that I expect to be in town quite to the end of June. I am reading the Green Book in bits--as it were--the only way in which I can read (or at least do read the contemporary novel--though I read so very few--almost none.) My only way of reading--apart from that--is to imagine myself writing the thing before me, treating the subject--and thereby often differing from the author and his--or her--way. I find G. W. very brisk and alive, but I have to take it in pieces, or liberal sips, and so have only reached the middle. What I feel critically (and I can feel about anything of the sort but critically) is that you don't squeeze your material hard and tight enough, to <b>press</b> <b>out</b> of its ounces and inches what they will give. That material lies too loose in your hand--or your hand, otherwise expressed, doesn't tighten round it. That is the fault of all fictive writing now, it seems to me--that and the inordinate abuse of dialogue--though this but one effect of the not squeezing. It's a wrong, a disastrous and unscientific economy altogether. I squeeze as I read you--but that, as I say, is rewriting! However, I will tell you more when I have eaten all the pieces. And I shall love and stick to you always--as your old, very old, oldest old ...|$|E
