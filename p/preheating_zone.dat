First, when shaft A is the [...] "primary" [...] and B the [...] "secondary" [...] shaft, the combustion air is added from the top of shaft A, while fuel somewhat below via burner lances. The flame is top-bottom. The hot gases pass downward, cross to shaft B via the so-called [...] "channel" [...] and pass upward to exhaust of shaft B. At same time in both shafts cooling air is added from the bottom to cool the lime and to make exhaust of gases via the bottom of the kiln impossible via maintaining always a positive pressure. The combustion air and cooling air leave the kiln jointly via exhaust on top of shaft B, preheating the stone. The direction of flow is reversed periodically (typically 5-10 times per hour) shaft A and B changing the role of [...] "primary" [...] and [...] "secondary" [...] shaft. The kiln has three zones: <b>preheating</b> <b>zone</b> on the top, burning zone in the middle, and cooling zone close to the bottom. The cycling produces a long burning zone of constant, relatively low temperature (around 950 °C) that is ideal for the production of high quality soft burned reactive lime. With exhaust gas temperatures as low as 120 °C and lime temperature at kiln outlet in 80 °C range the heat loss of the regenerative kiln is minimal, fuel consumption is as low as 3.6 MJ/kg. Due to these features the regenerative kilns are today mainstream technology under conditions of substantial fuel costs. Regenerative kilns are built with 150 to 800 t/day output, 300 to 450 being typical.|$|E

The burner was constructed to resemble as closely as possible a commercial household boiler with water heat exchanger. For several near stoichiometric flame conditions absolute number densities for CN, CH and NH were obtained using partially saturated LIF with Raman or Rayleigh calibration. For CN an independent measurement series using linear LIF with quenching corrections applied from known effective fluorescence lifetimes in an atmospheric pressure flames verified the results from the saturated LIF measurements.

A simultaneous dual-sheet Rayleigh/OH-LIPF measurement technique was applied using two parallel laser light sheets {{to measure the}} temperature in the <b>preheat</b> <b>zone</b> for three lean (ϕ= 0. 7) turbulent methane/air flames. The ratio of the turbulence intensity to the laminar burning velocity v′/sL was varied from 3. 5 to 9. 2 and to 18. 7. The first of these flames lies on the borderline between the “corrugated flamelets” regime and the “thin reaction zones” regime, while the other two are in the “thin reaction zones” regime. The results confirm the occurrence of strong temperature fluctuations ahead of the <b>preheat</b> <b>zone</b> for flames in the “thin reaction zones” regime. Single temperature images show a significant temperature increase ahead of the <b>preheat</b> <b>zones</b> of up to 700 K for flames at the highest turbulence intensity. For statistical analysis conditional mean temperature profiles and probability density functions conditioned on the distance from the flame contour were calculated from the experimental data. Only those portions of the flame front were included which were found to be approximately normal to the two laser sheets. The resulting probability density functions show that the effect of temperature rise ahead of the <b>preheat</b> <b>zone</b> becomes significant only for flames in the “thin reaction zones” regime.

In the present study, the thermal characteristics of a porous burner are numerically investigated {{for a range of}} operating conditions and design specifications within a practical range. The premixed flame propagation of a methane/air mixture in a ceramic porous medium is simulated through an unsteady, one-dimensional model. The combustion process is modeled using a suitable single-step chemical kinetics. The reaction location is not predetermined, thus the flame is allowed to float within the solid matrix or to run off from either side of the porous medium. The numerical results indicate that flame stability and thermal characteristics of the burner are strongly dependent on the inlet mixture specifications and the solid matrix structural properties. For a fixed value of the inlet firing rate, the combustion products temperature will increase by an increase in the inlet gas temperature, an increase in the matrix porosity, or by a decrease of the matrix pore density. Among the geometrical properties, the burner length has virtually no effect on the burner performance. An increase in the solid matrix porosity or burner firing rate will increase the efficiency of the <b>preheating</b> <b>zone,</b> while increasing the inlet gas temperature or matrix pore density will cause a reduction in this efficiency. Simulation results also suggest that in order to prevent flame blow-out or flash-back, critical values of the burner settings and design parameters must be avoided.

Two dimensional direct numerical simulation (2 D DNS) and one dimensional (1 D) detailed simulations of flame/spontaneous ignition interaction in a lean hydrogen/air mixture under a constant volume enclosure relevant to SACI engine conditions are performed using detailed chemistry and detailed transport properties. In a 2 D outward propagating spherical flame, thermal-diffusive instability is observed and once auto-ignition starts a low temperature region in the <b>preheat</b> <b>zone</b> of the flame is formed. Subsequently, the ignition in the <b>preheat</b> <b>zone</b> is suppressed. Then 1 D flame/ignition interactions in H 2 /air, syngas/air and methane/air mixtures are studied using detailed numerical simulations. The results reveal that due to preferential diffusion of hydrogen, heat and mass transfer in the <b>preheat</b> <b>zone</b> inhibits the ignition process, yielding a slower reaction rate hence an even lower temperature in the region. It is shown further that the low temperature region is not affected by the domain size and one step chemistry but it will disappear at very low initial temperature conditions.

40|$|Burning {{velocity}} and thermal diffusive {{structure of a}} triple flame generated with methane-air mixture are experimentally investigated in various fuel concentration gradients. The thermal diffusive width of premixed flame wing related <b>preheat</b> <b>zone,</b> which is measured from laser tomographic images, decreases by increasing the concentration gradient. On the other hand, burning velocity of the triple flame, which is mesured from PIV, is almost constant. C. J. Sun et al. propose the theory on the burning {{velocity and}} <b>preheat</b> <b>zone</b> width, which {{takes into account the}} effect of flame curvature, strain and Le number. The burning velocity by their theory is smaller than the measured triple flame burning velocity and shows the tendency to decrease by increasing the concentration gradient. Similarly, the <b>preheat</b> <b>zone</b> width by their theory is larger than the measured themal diffusive width of triple flame and is almost constant at any concentration gradients. Burning velocity along the premixed flame wing indicate the distribution of the flame temperature. These plofiles and flame sturucture show the tendency that heat flux from non-premixed flame to premixed flame goes up by increasing the concentration gradient. Especially, the rich side heat flux is larger than lean side one. Because of this effect, the thermal structure of the premixed flame wing is changed and the burning velocity is kept constant by changing the concentration gradient. These results indicate that there exists the thermal interaction between the premixed and non-premixed flames at a leading edge of the triple flame. And non-premixed flame interacts with rich premixed flame stronger than lean premixed flame...|$|R

40|$|High {{resolution}} planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) {{was applied}} to investigate the local flame front structures of turbulent premixed methane/air jet flames in order to reveal details about turbulence and flame interaction. The targeted turbulent flames were generated on a specially designed coaxial jet burner, in which low speed stoichiometric gas mixture was fed through the outer large tube to provide a laminar pilot flame for stabilization of the high speed jet flame issued through the small inner tube. By varying the inner tube flow speed and keeping the mixture composition {{as that of the}} outer tube, different flames were obtained covering both the laminar and turbulent flame regimes with different turbulent intensities. Simultaneous CH/CH 2 O, and also OH PLIF images were recorded to characterize the influence of turbulence eddies on the reaction zone structure, with a spatial resolution of about 40 mu m and temporal resolution of around 10 ns. Under all experimental conditions, the CH radicals were found to exist only in a thin layer; the CH 2 O were found in the inner flame whereas the OH radicals were seen in the outer flame with the thin CH layer separating the OH and CH 2 O layers. The outer OH layer is thick and it corresponds to the oxidation zone and post-flame zone; the CH 2 O layer is thin in laminar flows; it becomes broad at high speed turbulent flow conditions. This phenomenon was analyzed using chemical kinetic calculations and eddy/flame interaction theory. It appears that under high turbulence intensity conditions, the small eddies in the <b>preheat</b> <b>zone</b> can transport species such as CH 2 O from the reaction <b>zones</b> to the <b>preheat</b> <b>zone.</b> The CH 2 O species are not consumed in the <b>preheat</b> <b>zone</b> due to the absence of H, O, and OH radicals by which CH 2 O is to be oxidized. The CH radicals cannot exist in the <b>preheat</b> <b>zone</b> due to the rapid reactions of this species with O- 2 and CO 2 in the inner-layer of the reaction zones. The local PLIF intensities were evaluated using an area integrated PLIF signal. Substantial increase of the CH 2 O signal and decrease of CH signal was observed as the jet velocity increases. These observations raise new challenges to the current flamelet type models. (C) 2010 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

For turbulent premixed flames located in the thin-reaction-zones regime, small-scale eddies could penetrate into the <b>preheat</b> <b>zone</b> of the flames and enhance the mixing process. In this study, the effects of small-scale turbulence on emission (NOx and CO) formation in premixed flame fronts are investigated through the incorporation of turbulence induced diffusion in the <b>preheat</b> <b>zone</b> of one-dimensional premixed flames. One-dimensional methane/air premixed flames are simulated with the 53 -species GRI-Mech 3. 0 mechanism at both atmospheric and engine conditions with different turbulence intensities. It is found that the NO generated in flame fronts deceases with increasing intensity of small-scale turbulence and the effect is more profound at high pressures. At high pressures, the turbulence induced diffusion in the <b>preheat</b> <b>zone</b> can reduce the NOx formation in flame fronts by more than 40 %. On the other hand, the CO mass fraction in flame fronts increases with increasing intensity of small-scale turbulence. In the cases considered, the CO mass fraction in the flame fronts can increase by more than 55 %. In addition, a flamelet-based approach that accounts for the flame thickening effects has been formulated to simulate NOx and CO formation in turbulent lean premixed combustion. In this approach, the species NO and CO are transported and solved in a simulation with chemical source terms being pre-calculated from 1 -D premixed flames with detailed chemical kinetics and turbulence induced diffusion. The NO source term can be quantified by its formation in flame fronts and its formation rate in post-flame region. The CO source term can be calculated through its mass fraction at flame fronts, its mass fraction in the post-flame region and an oxidation time scale. The effect of heat loss on NO formation has been studied by investigate the relation between post-flame NO formation rate and flame temperature.

The jet flames were stabilized by a flat pilot flame generated using a McKenna type burner. Both flames were operated with a stoichiometric premixed methane/air mixture {{at room temperature}} and atmospheric pressure. Several flames, with varying jet flow speeds, were investigated, spanning from laminar (10 m/s jet exit velocity) up to highly turbulent flame conditions, with high Karlovitz numbers, (150 m/s jet exit velocity). Measuring the four species presented above provides detailed information on jet flame structures including the transition from fuel (indicated by the fuel tracer toluene) via the <b>preheat</b> <b>zone</b> (indicated by CH 2 O) and the inner layer of the flame front (indicated by CH) to the oxidation layer and the postflame zone (both indicated by OH).

This reduced mechanism {{is different from}} those employed in previous asymptotic analyses of stoichiometric and lean flames, because a steady-state approxi-mation is not introduced for CH 3. The aim of the present analysis is to develop an asymptotic model for rich flames, which can predict the rapid decrease of the burning velocity with increasing equivalence ratio f. In the analysis, the flame structure is presumed to consist of three zones: a <b>preheat</b> <b>zone</b> with a normalized thickness {{of the order of}} unity, a thin reaction zone, and a postflame <b>zone.</b> The <b>preheat</b> <b>zone</b> is presumed to be chemically inert, and in the postflame zone the products are in chemical equilibrium and the temperature is equal to the adiabatic flame temperature Tb.

The rate constants of these reactions are evaluated at T 0, which is the characteristic temperature at the inner layer. In the inner layer the dominant reactions taking place are those between the fuel and radicals, and between CH 3 and the radicals.

Different parameters such as the heat release rate, the mass loss rate, the geometry of the fire front and the heat transfers were investigated. Contrary to fire spread experiments performed along a flat surface, the mass loss rate and the heat release rate do not reach a quasi-steady state when the propagation takes place under slope condition. This {{is due to a}} V-shape distortion of the fire front, which leads to an increase of the surface rate burnt by the fire over time. The study of this quantity has shown that the heat release over time can be estimated with the fuel load and the time derivative of the burnt surface. This approach can be a good alternative to estimate accurately the heat release rate at field scale when the measure of oxygen consumption is not possible.

These scalar fields offer a possibility of revisiting the structures of turbulent premixed flames in different combustion regimes. In particular, CH 2 O provides {{a measure of the}} <b>preheat</b> <b>zone,</b> CH/HCO a measure of the inner layer of the reaction zone, and OH a measure of the oxidation zone. Scalar correlations are analyzed on both single-shot and statistical basis, and resolvable correlated structures of ∼ 100 µm between scalars are captured. With increasing turbulence intensity, it is shown that the <b>preheat</b> <b>zone</b> and the inner layer of the reaction zone become gradually broadened/distributed, and the correlation between HCO and [OH]LIF×[CH 2 O]LIF decreases. A transition from the TRZ regime to the DRZ regime is found around Karlovitz number of 70 – 100. The physical and chemical effects on the broadening of the flame are investigated. In the TRZ regime the inner layer marker CH and HCO remains thin in general although occasional local broadening of CH/HCO could be observed. Furthermore, there is a significant probability of finding CH and HCO at rather low temperatures even in the TRZ regime. In the DRZ regime, the broadening of CH and HCO are shown to be mainly a result of local reactions facilitated by rapid turbulent transport of radicals and intermediate reactants in the upstream of the reaction paths.

40|$|Dilute Oxygen Combustion (DOC) burners {{have been}} {{successfully}} installed and operated in the reheat furnace at Auburn Steel Co., Inc., Auburn, NY, under Phase 3 of the Dilute Oxygen Combustion project. Two new <b>preheat</b> <b>zones</b> were created employing a total of eight 6. 5 MMBtu/hr capacity burners. The <b>preheat</b> <b>zones</b> provide a 30 percent increase in maximum furnace production rate, from 75 tph to 100 tph. The fuel rate is essentially unchanged, with the fuel savings expected from oxy-fuel combustion being offset by higher flue gas temperatures. When allowance is made for the high nitrogen level and high gas phase temperature in the furnace, measured NOx emissions {{are in line with}} laboratory data on DOC burners developed in Phase 1 of the project. Burner performance has been good and there have been no operating or maintenance problems. The DOC system continues to be used as part of Auburn Steel?s standard reheat furnace practice. High gas phase temperature {{is a result of the}} high firing density needed to achieve high production rates, and little opportunity exists for improvement in that area. However, fuel and NOx performance can be improved by further conversion of furnace zones to DOC burners, which will lower furnace nitrogen levels. Major obstacles are cost and concern about increased formation of oxide scale on the steel. Oxide scale formation may be enhanced by exposure of the steel to higher concentrations of oxidizing gas components (primarily products of combustion) in the higher temperature zones of the furnace. Phase 4 of the DOC project will examine the rate of oxide scale formation in these higher temperature zones and develop countermeasures that will allow DOC burners to be used successfully in these furnace zones...|$|R
40|$|The {{propagation}} of a reaction front through a packed bed is analyzed theoretically. The chemical reaction rate {{is represented by}} Arrhenius temperature kinetics with external transfer limitation and general power law dependency on both gaseous and solid reactant concentrations. Analogous to so-called “Activation Energy Asymptotics ” developed for premixed laminar flames, the largeness of the activation energy of the chemical reaction is exploited to derive asymptotic solutions from the three governing differential equations pertaining to transport of heat, of solid reactant, and of gaseous reactant, making use of the method of matched asymptotic expansions. Two regions are distinguished, i. e., an outer region or <b>preheat</b> <b>zone</b> and an inner region or reaction <b>zone.</b> In the <b>preheat</b> <b>zone,</b> the reaction terms can be neglected {{as compared to the}} convective and diffusive terms. In the reaction zone, the diffusion of heat is dominating over the convective heat transport mechanism and balances the heat of reaction. In accordance with the magnitudes taken for the Lewis numbers, for solid and gaseous reactants convective transports are dominating and submitting diffusive transports in the reaction zone, respectively. Solutions in closed form are presented for governing variables including reaction front velocity whereby previously published results appear as special cases. The solutions provide direct insight into underlying physical processes and enable the effects of important parameters to be quantified analytically. © 2001 by The Combustion Institute NOMENCLATURE B 0 integration constant C 0 integration constant Cp apparent specific heat [J/(kg K) ] cp specific heat [J/(kg K) ] Da,eff effective axial dispersion coefficient [m 2 /s] Ea activation energy [J/mol] Es dispersion coefficient for solid phase reactant [m 2 /s] DHr reaction enthalpy [J/kg] Kg ratio of generalized transport coefficient to reaction rate at temperature Tb Kr reaction rate at temperature...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the heat transfer {{characteristics of a}} self-aspirating porous radiant burner (SAPRB) that operates {{on the basis of}} an effective energy conversion method between flowing gas enthalpy and thermal radiation. The temperature field at various flame zones was measured experimentally by the help of both FLUKE IR camera and K-type thermocouples. The experimental setup consisted of a two layered domestic cooking burner, a flexible test stand attached with six K-type thermocouples at different positions, IR camera, LPG setup and a hot wire anemometer. The two layered SAPRB consisted of a combustion zone and a <b>preheating</b> <b>zone.</b> Time dependent temperature history from thermocouples at various flame zones were acquired by using a data acquisition system and the temperature profiles were analyzed in the ZAILA application software environments. In the other hand the IR graphs were captured by FLUKE IR camera and the thermographs were analyzed in the SMARTView software environments. The experimental results revealed that the homogeneous porous media, in addition to its convective heat exchange with the gas, might absorb, emit, and scatter thermal radiation. The rate of heat transfer was more {{at the center of the}} burner where a combined effect of both convection & radiation might be realized. The maximum thermal efficiency was found to be 64 % which was having a good agreemen...|$|E
40|$|Biodiesel {{reforming}} with a NiAl 2 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 -YSZ {{catalyst for}} the production of renewable SOFC fuel N. Abatzoglou, C. Fauteux-Lefebvre & N. Braidy Université de Sherbrooke, Canada Biodiesel’s contribution as a renewable energy carrier is increasing continuously. Fuel cell market penetration, although slow, is now an irreversible reality. The combination of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) with biodiesel offers considerable advantages because it entails both high energy conversion efficiency and near-zero atmospheric carbon emissions. This work is aimed at proving the efficiency of a newly-developed (patent pending), Al 2 O 3 /YSZ-supported NiAl 2 O 4 spinel catalyst to steam reform biodiesel. Reforming converts biodiesel into a gaseous mixture, mainly composed of H 2 and CO, used directly as SOFC fuel. The work is performed in a test rig comprising a lab-scale, fixed-bed isothermal reactor and a product-conditioning train. The biodiesel/water mixtures are emulsified prior to their spray injection in the reactor <b>preheating</b> <b>zone,</b> where they are instantaneously vaporized and rapidly brought to the desired reaction temperature to avoid thermal cracking. Reforming takes place at gas hourly space velocities equal to or higher than those in industrial reforming units. The products are analysed by at-line gas chromatography. The results show that biodiesel conversion is complete at steady state. Thermodynamic calculations reveal that the fast reforming reaction reaches chemical equilibrium. The catalyst’s performance is very efficient and prevents carbon formation and deactivation...|$|E
40|$|HF (hydrogen fluoride) {{emission}} control {{is one of}} the critical environmental parameters in the firing of ceramic materials at peak temperatures higher than 1000 °C. In this study, in-stack concentrations of HF were monitored on-line with laser-based equipment during the fast firing of ceramic tiles in continuous industrial roller hearth kilns under standard kiln operating conditions. Three different ceramic tile compositions: porous red-body wall tiles, red-body stoneware tiles, and porcelain tiles were fired in industrial kilns customarily used to manufacture these types of tiles, modifying the heating rate and tile dry bulk density. The in-stack concentrations of HF can be explained on the basis of tile HF adsorption and emission processes in the kiln preheating and firing zones, analysed in previous studies. The methodology used in this study has significant advantages for industrial studies compared with previous methodologies based primarily on laboratory-scale studies and analysis of solid material. The main advantages are: (a) rapid response, allowing abrupt changes in the HF emission to be studied; and (b) direct measurement of the in-stack concentration of HF, which is the most common parameter used as a legal limit for industrial {{emission control}}. The study shows that tile HF adsorption in the <b>preheating</b> <b>zone</b> is very important. It also shows that HF stack emissions can vary significantly in continuous kilns depending on whether glazed or unglazed tiles are produced, or important changes occur in production (such as gaps in the kiln feed). The results indicate, furthermore, that HF stack emissions do not decrease significantly when realistic changes are made in industrial operating conditions if these industrial kilns are run at peak temperatures above 1100 °C. The most important reduction in in-stack concentrations of HF is observed when glazed ceramic tiles are fired, so further research in this field can be made in order to reduce HF emissions. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} expanding flame kernels following localized ignition in decaying turbulence with the fuel {{in the form}} of a fine mist have been performed to identify the effects of the spray parameters on the possibility of self-sustained combustion. Simulations show that the flame kernel may quench due to fuel starvation in the gaseous phase if the droplets are large or if their number is insufficient to result in significant heat release to allow for self-sustained flame propagation for the given turbulent environment. The reaction proceeds in a large range of equivalence ratios due to the random location of the droplets relative to the igniter location that causes a wide range of mixture fractions to develop through pre-evaporation in the unreacted gas and through evaporation in the <b>preheat</b> <b>zone</b> of the propagating flame. The resulting flame exhibits both premixed and non-premixed characteristics...|$|R
40|$|In this study, an {{analytical}} model for heat recirculation in cylindrical micro-combustors is presented, including {{the effects of}} heat transfer from the product gas stream in the reaction zone and post-ﬂame region to the reactant in the <b>preheat</b> <b>zone,</b> structural heat conduction through the combustor walls and heat loss to ambient. Eventually, the explicit expression for the ﬂame speed in non-adiabatic condition and the implicit expression for adiabatic condition are obtained in this research. In addition, comparison is made between adiabatic and non-adiabatic ﬂame speeds. It is demonstrated that the streamwise heat conduction through the structure of combustor {{plays an important role}} in the ﬂame broadening in both adiabatic and non-adiabatic conditions. Moreover, it is shown that reducing the size of the combustor to a submillimetre scale extremely increases the surface-to-volume ratio, leading to the decrease in the ﬂame speed and ﬂame quenching...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of flame propagation has been qualitatively formulated. In accordance with this formulation, the chemical reaction initiated in some layer brings about {{an increase in}} the temperature because of the heat conduction, the temperature is raised in the neighborin ~ layer where in turn the chemical reaction is ini-tiated. In this manner the flame is propagated. Michelson (reference 1) is credited with presenting the first reliable method for measuring the flame speed and for computinz the temperature distribution in the <b>preheated</b> <b>zone</b> of burning gas. In various papers on the theory of the speed of combustion (Jouguet (reference 2), Nusselt (reference 3), Daniell (reference 4), and others), a solution is found only by making simplifying assumptions that do not correspond to the actual conditions. The comparatively unknown work of Taffanel (reference 5) is the most similar to present-day views...|$|R
