5|$|Balabushka {{was an avid}} billiards player, {{especially}} of the game of straight pool, taking part in competitions and spending time with well-known practitioners of the sport. In 1959, he purchased a Brooklyn-based pool hall with partner, Frank McGown, which was located at 50th Street and 5th Avenue. While running the room, he began repairing cues as a hobby, and soon the idea was sparked to design and manufacture his own line of <b>pool</b> <b>cues.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Balabushka met Penndel, Pennsylvania native Gus Szamboti at a tournament. Szamboti {{had been}} working for RCA as a {{draftsman}} and designer, but RCA layoffs were common at the time, and he had started designing and selling <b>pool</b> <b>cues</b> as a more stable job path. Though he too started production with Titlist blanks as well as blanks manufactured by WICO of Chicago, Szamboti later began making his own. Balabushka was very impressed with Szamboti's blanks and, in addition to the two men becoming fast friends, he became Szamboti's first customer, buying blanks from him for $18 apiece.|$|E
500|$|Carom billiard cues have {{specialized}} refinements {{making them}} {{different from the}} typical pool cue with which many people are more familiar. Such cues tend to be shorter and lighter overall, with a shorter , a thicker [...] and , a wooden joint [...] (in high-end examples) and [...] wood-to-wood joint (for a one-piece cue [...] "feel"), a fast, conical , and a smaller [...] diameter as compared with <b>pool</b> <b>cues.</b> Typical cues are [...] in length and [...] in weight—lighter for straight rail, heavier for three-cushion—with a tip [...] in diameter. The specialization makes the cue significantly stiffer, which aids in handling the larger and heavier billiard balls as compared with <b>pool</b> <b>cues.</b> It also acts to reduce [...] (sometimes called [...] "squirt"), which may be defined as displacement of the cue ball's path away from the parallel line formed by the cue stick's direction of travel. It is a factor that occurs every time [...] (...) is employed, and its effects are magnified by speed. In some carom games, deflection plays a large role because many shots require extremes of , coupled with great speed; this is a combination typically minimized as much as possible, by contrast, in pool. The wood used in carom cues can vary widely, and most quality carom cues are handmade.|$|E

2500|$|Born in Longobucco, Francesco Ioele (yo-ay-leh) and {{his family}} arrived in the United States c. 1900. As a teenager, Ioele was befriended by John Torrio, who ushered him into the Five Points Gang and groomed him {{for a life of}} crime. Shortly after Torrio left for Chicago, in 1909, Ioele [...] "Americanized" [...] his last name to Yale. Despite his medium height and chubby build, Yale was a fearsome fistfighter and thief.

One of his early arrests, in October 1912, was on suspicion of homicide.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first act}} on the stage, Santana, gave a {{performance}} that generally went smoothly; however, {{over the course of}} the day, the mood of both the crowd and the Angels became progressively agitated and violent. The Angels had been drinking their free beer all day in front of the stage, and most were very drunk. The crowd had also become antagonistic and unpredictable, attacking each other, the Angels, and the performers. A Mick Jagger biographer, Anthony Scaduto, in Mick Jagger: Everybody's Lucifer, wrote that the only time the crowd seemed to calm down to any degree was during a set by the country-rocking Flying Burrito Brothers. By the time the Rolling Stones took the stage in the early evening, the mood had taken a decidedly ugly turn as numerous fights had erupted between Angels and crowd members and within the crowd itself. Denise Jewkes, lead singer of the local San Francisco rock band the Ace of Cups, six months pregnant, was hit in the head by an empty beer bottle thrown from the crowd and suffered a skull fracture. The Stones later [...] paid all of Jewkes' ambulance and medical services. [...] The Angels proceeded to arm themselves with sawed-off <b>pool</b> <b>cues</b> and motorcycle chains to drive the crowd further back from the stage.|$|E
