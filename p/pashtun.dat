5|$|The unrest {{caused by}} this {{division}} of the <b>Pashtun</b> lands led {{to the rise of}} Saidullah, a <b>Pashtun</b> fakir who led an army of at least 10,000 against the British garrison in Malakand. Although the British forces were divided among a number of poorly defended positions, the small garrison at the camp of Malakand South and the small fort at Chakdara were both able to hold out for six days against the much larger <b>Pashtun</b> army.|$|E
5|$|The last {{remaining}} {{forces from the}} now evacuated northern camp arrived in Malakand South at 8:30am on the 27th, coinciding {{with the arrival of}} more <b>Pashtun</b> reinforcements. In Nowshera, the 11th Bengal Lancers awoke to news describing the situation, and, together with the 38th Dogras, the 35th Sikhs, No.1 and No.7 British Mountain Batteries, they set off to relieve the besieged garrison. Meanwhile, at Malakand South, fresh <b>Pashtun</b> attacks were repulsed by elements of the 24th led by Climo, whose unit captured a <b>Pashtun</b> standard.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, <b>Pashtun</b> {{forces had}} {{successfully}} assaulted the camp in three other locations, and the 24th Punjab Infantry's picket lines were quickly overrun. <b>Pashtun</b> sharpshooters occupying the nearby heights inflicted casualties throughout the night, and the bazaar and surrounding buildings were occupied. Other {{units of the}} 24th, under Lieutenant Climo, retook the area and held it until 10:45pm, but under fire from sharpshooters they were driven back. The <b>Pashtun</b> forces broke through {{in a number of}} other locations. Lieutenant Watling commanding a group of British troops guarding the ammunitions stores at the Quarter Guard was wounded, losing the stores in the process. Meiklejohn led a small group of sappers, members of the 24th and Captain Holland, Climo from the earlier charge, and Lieutenant Manley to recapture the ammunition dump; Holland and the General were wounded, and the group severely depleted as it twice failed to retake the dump, but a third attempt proved successful. However, continuing crossfire from the enveloping <b>Pashtun</b> troops wounded a number of British officers, placing the command of the 24th with Climo. Towards 1:00am on the morning of July 27, Lieutenant Edmund William Costello rescued a wounded havildar while under fire and was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions.|$|E
50|$|There is, however, {{no strong}} {{evidence}} to show any genealogical connection between the present-day <b>Pashtuns</b> and the ancient Semitic-speaking Israelites. DNA shows that <b>Pashtuns</b> have several Y-haplogroups, although R1a makes up about 51% among <b>Pashtuns.</b> Hence, <b>Pashtuns</b> have a significant affinity with their neighboring Indo-European speaking ethnic groups, and most present-day <b>Pashtuns</b> descended from the original Indo-European population who {{have lived in the}} territory by other names, such as Arachosians,(Indo-Iranians), and their forebears.|$|R
50|$|There {{are more}} than 500,000 <b>Pashtuns</b> in the UAE. This figure also {{includes}} <b>Pashtuns</b> from neighbouring Afghanistan.|$|R

5|$|Taraki {{was born}} on 15 July 1917 to a Ghilzai <b>Pashtun</b> peasant family in Nawa District of Ghazni Province, Afghanistan. He was the oldest of three {{children}} and attended a village school in Nawa before leaving in 1932, {{at the age of}} 15, to work in the port city of Bombay, India. There he met a Kandahari merchant family who employed him as a clerk for the <b>Pashtun</b> Trading Company. Taraki's first encounter with communism was during his night courses, where he met several Communist Party of India members who impressed him with their discussions on social justice and communist values. Another important event was his encounter with Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, a <b>Pashtun</b> nationalist and leader of the Red Shirt Movement in neighboring India, who was an admirer of the works of Vladimir Lenin.|$|E
5|$|As {{the night}} wore on, {{reinforcements}} arrived {{from a nearby}} British hill fort which had as yet been ignored by the <b>Pashtun</b> forces. At 4:15pm, the attacking forces withdrew with their dead and wounded. The British had lost {{a large number of}} officers wounded, and recorded 21 deaths amongst the sepoys.|$|E
5|$|Photos of {{the real-life}} Marcus Luttrell, Mohammad Gulab and the fallen service members who {{died during the}} mission are shown during a four-minute montage, and an {{epilogue}} reveals that the <b>Pashtun</b> villagers agreed to help Luttrell {{as part of a}} traditional code of honor known as the Pashtunwali.|$|E
5000|$|Most historians {{acknowledge}} that {{the origin of the}} <b>Pashtuns</b> is somewhat unclear, although there are many conflicting theories, some modern and others archaic, both among historians and the <b>Pashtuns</b> themselves. [...] "... the origin of the Afghans is so obscure, that no one, even among the oldest and most clever of the tribe, can give satisfactory information on this point." [...] "Looking for the origin of <b>Pashtuns</b> and the Afghans is something like exploring the source of the Amazon. Is there one specific beginning? And are the <b>Pashtuns</b> originally identical with the Afghans? Although the <b>Pashtuns</b> nowadays constitute a clear ethnic group with their own language and culture, there is no evidence whatsoever that all modern <b>Pashtuns</b> share the same ethnic origin. In fact it is highly unlikely." ...|$|R
50|$|In the 1880s, Abdur Rahman Khan {{moved the}} rebellious Ghilzai <b>Pashtuns</b> from the {{southern}} part of the country to the northern part. In addition to this, Abdur Rahman and his successors encouraged <b>Pashtuns</b> (with various incentives) <b>Pashtuns</b> to voluntarily settle in northern Afghanistan in the late 19th and 20th centuries.|$|R

5|$|In February 2009, FATA's provincial {{government}} officially declared Islamic law in Swat {{to achieve a}} ceasefire with the northwestern <b>Pashtun</b> tribes. Because the United States and Britain opposed the measure, Zardari did not sign the Swat ceasefire until mid-April, when domestic pressure from Parliament mounted. By the end of April, the agreement collapsed as the Pakistani military pursued an unpopular offensive in the neighbouring Dir district.|$|E
5|$|Karmal {{was born}} Sultan Hussein on 6 January 1929, {{was the son}} of Muhammad Hussein Hashem, a Major General in the Afghan Army and former {{governor}} of the province of Paktia, and was the second of five siblings. His family was one of the wealthier families in Kabul. His ethnic background is disputed, some claim that he was Tajik who represented himself as a Ghilzai <b>Pashtun</b> but others claim that he descended from Hindu ancestors of Kashmir. In 1986, Karmal announced that he, and his brother Mahmud Baryalay, were <b>Pashtun</b> because their mother came from the Mullakhel branch of the Pashtuns. However, this was controversial, considering that lineage in Afghanistan is supposed to be traced through the father, not the mother. The accusation that he was of Indian Muslim ancestry {{comes from the fact that}} his birthname, Sultan Hussein, is a common Indian Muslim name. In addition, Karmal's own father denied his own ethnicity; Karmal's father was a Tajik. To further confuse the matter, Karmal spoke Dari (Persian) and not Pashto.|$|E
5|$|Tariq, {{an ethnic}} <b>Pashtun</b> born in 1976, {{is a boy}} {{who grew up in}} Kabul with Laila. He lost a leg to a land mine at the age of five.

50|$|The <b>Pashtuns,</b> {{originally}} from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Afghanistan, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and northern Balochistan, {{are now the}} city's second largest ethnic group after Muhajirs, these <b>Pashtuns</b> are settled in Karachi from decades. With as high as 7 million by some estimates the city of Karachi in Pakistan has the largest concentration of urban Pakhtun population in the world, including 50,000 registered Afghan refugees in the city, meaning there are more <b>Pashtuns</b> in Karachi {{than in any other}} city in the world. As per current demographic ratio <b>Pashtuns</b> are about 25% of Karachi's population.|$|R
5|$|The {{daylight}} hours of 28 July saw continuous {{fire from the}} <b>Pashtun</b> sharpshooters established in the hills surrounding Malakand South. The garrison surgeon, Lieutenant J.H. Hugo, treated a number of British casualties including an officer from the Guides. Despite further attacks during the night of July 28/29, the British recorded only two killed from the sepoy ranks, and the severe wounding of a Lieutenant Ford. Churchill records that Ford's bleeding artery was clamped shut by Hugo despite being under fire.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of Malakand was the 26 July â€“ 2 August 1897 {{siege of}} the British {{garrison}} in the Malakand region of colonial British India's North West Frontier Province. The British faced {{a force of}} <b>Pashtun</b> tribesmen whose tribal lands had been bisected by the Durand Line, the 1,519 mile (2,445km) border between Afghanistan and British India drawn {{up at the end}} of the Anglo-Afghan wars to help hold back what the British feared to be the Russian Empire's spread of influence towards the Indian subcontinent.|$|E
5|$|At 2:00a.m. on 30 July, the Pashtuns {{launched}} another attack, {{during which}} Costello, and the <b>Pashtun</b> Mullah, were both wounded; the British also recorded one fatality among the sepoy contingent. That evening a further attack was repulsed by a bayonet {{charge of the}} 45th Sikhs. The following morning, on 31 July, {{the remainder of the}} 38th Dogras and 35th Sikhs entered Malakand South under the command of Colonel Reid, bringing with them 243 mules carrying 291,600 rounds of ammunition. But with their attention now drawn towards the nearby British outpost of Chakdara, attacks by the Pashtuns on Malakand South began to reduce until they ceased altogether. Churchill records a total of three British officers killed in action and 10 wounded, seven sepoy officers wounded, and 153 non-commissioned officers killed and wounded during the siege of Malakand South.|$|E

5|$|In Peshawar, satyagraha {{was led by}} a Muslim Pashto {{disciple of}} Gandhi, Ghaffar Khan, who had trained 50,000 nonviolent activists called Khudai Khidmatgar. On 23 April 1930, Ghaffar Khan was arrested. A crowd of Khudai Khidmatgar {{gathered}} in Peshawar's Kissa Khani (Storytellers) Bazaar. The British ordered troops of 2/18 battalion of Royal Garhwal Rifles to open fire with machine guns on the unarmed crowd, killing an estimated 200â€“250. The <b>Pashtun</b> satyagrahis acted in accord with their training in nonviolence, willingly facing bullets as the troops fired on them. One British Indian Army Soldier Chandra Singh Garwali and troops of the renowned Royal Garhwal Rifles, refused to fire at the crowds. The entire platoon was arrested and many received heavy penalties, including life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Luttrell stumbles upon a {{small body}} of water and submerges himself, only to find upon {{surfacing}} that a local <b>Pashtun</b> villager, Mohammad Gulab, has discovered his location. Gulab takes Luttrell into his care, returning to his village, where he attempts to hide Luttrell in his home. Gulab then sends a mountain man to the nearest American air base to alert military forces to Luttrell's location. The Taliban fighters arrive at the village to capture and kill Luttrell, but Gulab and the villagers intervene, threatening to kill the fighters if they harm Luttrell. The fighters leave, but later return to punish the villagers for protecting Luttrell. Gulab and his fellow militia are able to fend off several fighters during the ensuing attack. American forces, arriving via helicopters, shatter the advancing Taliban and, in the process, kill {{the bulk of the}} insurgents with concentrated weaponry fire. The American forces evacuate Luttrell back to base.|$|E
5|$|The film shows Luttrell (Wahlberg) {{being able}} to walk after the Taliban's ambush on the four-man SEAL team. In reality, Luttrell {{explained}} that his legs were numb immediately after the ambush, and when feeling did return to them, the pain from the shrapnel in his legs made it too painful to walk; he had to crawl seven miles looking for water and sanctuary. Luttrell {{also said that he}} did not witness the MH-47 Chinook helicopter being shot down, as seen in the film. At the end of the film, the <b>Pashtun</b> villagers fight off a Taliban attack in a firefight that never actually happened. In reality, the Taliban fighters were outnumbered by the villagers and had no intentions of attacking the village. They did, however, try to sneak in and capture Luttrell in secret. Luttrell also did not go into cardiac arrest after he was rescued, nor was he near death, as seen in the film.|$|E
5000|$|The ethnonym Afghan {{has been}} {{historically}} used since the 3rd century AD {{to refer to}} the <b>Pashtuns,</b> and is now used to describe every citizen of Afghanistan. <b>Pashtuns</b> make up the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan, comprising 42-60% [...] of the total Afghan population.

5|$|Hafizullah Amin {{was born}} to a Ghilzai <b>Pashtun</b> family in Paghman on 1 August 1929. His father, a civil servant, {{died when he was}} still very young. Thanks to his brother Abdullah, a primary school teacher, Amin was able to attend both primary and {{secondary}} school, which in turn allowed him to attend Kabul University (KU). After studying mathematics there, he also graduated from the Darul Mualimeen Teachers College in Kabul, and became a teacher. Amin later became vice-principal of the Darul Mualimeen College, and then principal of the prestigious Avesina High School, and in 1957 left Afghanistan for Columbia University in New York City, where he earned M. A. in education. It was at Columbia that Amin became attracted to Marxism, and in 1958 he {{became a member of the}} university's Socialist Progressive Club. When he returned to Afghanistan, Amin became a teacher at Kabul University, and later, for the second time, the principal of Avesina High School. During this period Amin became acquainted with Nur Muhammad Taraki, a communist. Around this time, Amin quit his position as principal of Avesina High School in order to become principal of the Darul Mualimeen College.|$|E
25|$|Claimants of <b>Pashtun</b> {{heritage}} in South Asia have mixed with local Muslim populations and {{are referred to}} as Pathan, the Hindustani form of <b>Pashtun.</b> These communities are usually partial <b>Pashtun,</b> to varying degrees, and often trace their <b>Pashtun</b> ancestry through a paternal lineage.
