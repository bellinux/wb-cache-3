It held that Lexmark's authentication sequence did not [...] "control access" [...] to the program; rather, {{the purchase of the}} printer itself allowed access to the program: ...|$|E
50|$|HP {{introduced}} {{their first}} desktop {{model with a}} Ricoh engine for $12,800 in 1983. Sales of the non-networked product were unsurprisingly poor. In 1983 Canon introduced the LBP-CX, a desktop laser <b>printer</b> <b>engine</b> using a laser diode and featuring an output resolution of 300 dpi. In 1984, HP released the first commercially available system based on the LBP-CX, the HP LaserJet.|$|E
50|$|On the DMCA counts, Feikens {{agreed that}} Lexmark had not {{established}} a violation {{with regards to}} the Toner Loading Program, but for a very different reason than that found by the majority opinion. He noted that SCC had testified that it had not even been aware that the Toner Loading Program existed; it had copied the data on the Lexmark printer chip (including the Toner Loading Program) purely in an attempt to bypass the protection on the <b>Printer</b> <b>Engine</b> Program. Since the DMCA requires that an infringer knowingly circumvent access controls on the protected program, SCC could not have knowingly circumvented protections on a program it did not know existed. With regards to the <b>Printer</b> <b>Engine</b> Program, he agreed with the majority opinion, but also noted in his belief that the consumer had acquired the rights to access this program by purchasing the printer, and therefore the DMCA would not apply to attempts to access it.|$|E
50|$|LaserDirect - a {{range of}} laser printers. The company {{developed}} the world's first 600dpi that retailed under £1000 (it purchased <b>printer</b> <b>engines</b> from Canon Inc, and using its own drivers and laser modulation techniques (hardware and software) was able to increase the resolution to 600dpi.|$|R
50|$|MIPS cores {{have been}} commercially successful, {{now being used}} in many {{consumer}} and industrial applications. MIPS cores {{can be found in}} newer Cisco, Linksys and Mikrotik's routerboard routers, cable modems and ADSL modems, smartcards, laser <b>printer</b> <b>engines,</b> set-top boxes, robots, and hand-held computers. In cellphones and PDAs, MIPS has been largely unable to displace the incumbent, competing ARM architecture.|$|R

It will use a page description language as the interpreter kernel, but also supporting major graphics languages and image file formats. This will be combined with intelligently hinted outline-fonts available in {{the system as a}} common font resource. The EuroRip is an integrated hardware and software solution. It will drive directly a screen and a common laserprinter engine. Furthermore, EuroRip could easily adapted to special screens, laser or inkjet <b>printer</b> <b>engines</b> or typesetters.

5000|$|Initially, {{they built}} three {{printers}}, testing {{the first in}} March 2011. Their first printers used a Zink <b>printer</b> <b>engine,</b> which meant they were “ink-free,” instead pulling color from the paper itself. Polaroid also uses Zink printer engines for its products. The first appearance of the Instaprint hashtag printers was on a live site launched on March 7, 2011. The site featured a live stream {{of two of the}} printers hung up in the office window of Breakfast. Any print hashtagged #instaprint would be printed live on the site. [...] The week after the live site was launched, the Instaprint team brought the hashtag printers to SXSW. The hashtag printers generated a lot of excitement, and they were invited to multiple popular events at the festival. Felicia Day invited them over Twitter to the Driskell hotel. Here, the team set up the printers and met several celebrities excited by the product, including Instagram co-founder, Mike Kruger, who came out specifically to see the hashtag printers.|$|E

This is supported also by the availability of supporting tools for creation and the increasing complexity of the human need for a convenience. In using such a product, the user will always be looking for a more practical both in use and in storage, because these things will greatly ease the burden of users in using it. Along with the development of a product will always have innovation in accordance with the needs of its users. Due {{to the success of the}} industry in the face of competition is determined by the success in designing and developing products that conform to the desires of consumers and the industry in adapting speed. <b>Printer</b> <b>engine</b> is one tool to print the results of the computer with paper media, when people are generally still believe the machine as a printer paper printing equipment. <b>Printer</b> <b>engine</b> has yet been modified according to the needs of the owner in the field of digital garment industry such as the garment digital printing. At this time the garment industry printer to print the image onto the fabric still using heatter press machine using the machine still require transfer paper which adds to the cost of production for print and buy transfer paper, transfer paper because it will be banished to the required design and product development directly print fabric. That way in the world of innovation and industry find an exact efesiesi required. Given these problems then do research that aims to design and develop products that printer machine printer can print the results to the media fabric or garment in the world according to the needs of industry fabric screen printing & digital printing more efficient and can reduce production costs in order to achieve finaly sucses in the digital industry.

40|$|Current inkjet {{printing}} systems {{are based on}} a RISC+ASIC architecture for image processing and printer control. Time critical control function such as print masking is implemented on an ASIC and computationally intensive tasks such as image processing and motion control are executed on a RISC processor. This paper considers the development of a DSP based media handling and cartridge motion control system for an inkjet printer, in which a single high performance DSP is desired to execute the printer control as well as image processing tasks and print with the novel {{inkjet printing}} approach of Dynamic Print Mode Control (DPMC). A motion control architecture is implemented to maximize the use of DSP processing power and system memory while taking into account the latencies of motion controllers in printing a swath. The architecture utilizes various real-time services of DSP/BIOS to effectively manage DSP and <b>printer</b> <b>engine</b> while increasing printer throughput and it can be easily extended to include image processing activities on the DSP. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed motion control architecture and the control scheme for cartridge motion control...|$|E
5000|$|Portions of {{the program}} allowed the user to design screens, called [...] "Forms" [...] in R:Base. Line-draw {{characters}} could implement buttons or boxes that would group text on screen. A separate utility allowed the design of printed output formats and was called [...] "Reports." [...] The report design system allowed a user to define and edit fields included in database reports on screen. Limited printer support was included as DOS programs each had their own unique printer driver for similar <b>printer</b> <b>engines.</b> A markup language allowed italics and bold output if the corresponding printer had a capability. Reports could be piped to the display or a serial port for testing if one were so inclined. Database names were constrained to seven characters. The actual data were contained in three files. In an example database named Sales, files name SALES1.RBF SALES2.RBF, AND SALES3.RBF would contain the database. Forms and reports were stored in files external to the database file.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the cost}} of {{implementation}} was high; computers output raw PS code that would be interpreted by the printer into a raster image at the printer's natural resolution. This required high performance microprocessors and ample memory. The LaserWriter used a 12 MHz Motorola 68000, making it faster {{than any of the}} Macintosh computers to which it attached. When the laser <b>printer</b> <b>engines</b> themselves cost over a thousand dollars the added cost of PS was marginal. But as printer mechanisms fell in price, {{the cost of}} implementing PS became too great a fraction of overall printer cost; in addition, with desktop computers becoming more powerful, it no longer made sense to offload the rasterisation work onto the resource-constrained printer. By 2001, few lower-end printer models came with support for PostScript, largely due to growing competition from much cheaper non-PostScript ink jet printers, and new software-based methods to render PostScript images on the computer, making them suitable for any printer; PDF, a descendant of PostScript, provides one such method, and has largely replaced PostScript as de facto standard for electronic document distribution.|$|R
50|$|Basic {{label printer}} {{applicator}}s consist of three primary parts: a <b>printer,</b> or print <b>engine,</b> an applicator and {{a method to}} handle label and ribbons, referred to as media.

40|$|Massive {{amounts of}} useful data are stored and {{processed}} in ad hoc formats for which common tools like parsers, <b>printers,</b> query <b>engines</b> and format converters are not readily available. In this paper, we explain {{the design and}} implementation of PADS/ML, a new language and system that facilitates the generation of data processing tools for ad hoc formats. The PADS/ML design includes features such as dependent, polymorphic and recursive datatypes, which allow programmers to describe the syntax and semantics of ad hoc data in a concise, easy-to-read notation. The PADS/ML implementation compiles these descriptions into ML structures and functors that include types for parsed data, functions for parsing and printing, and auxiliary support for user-specified, format-dependent and format-independent tool generation...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the need}} to have a guide for the {{implementation}} of informatics applications, and thus achieve automate tasks improving response times of users, designed the framework of reference the architecture software for web and mobile applications with technology free software and open source. The technology to be used is the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) with JAVA programming language, a client / server architecture and style of multitier architecture, which will allow us to create scalable, robust and stable systems, together of Java Platform Enterprise Edition (JEE) that helps us to implement business applications thanks to the JPA and EJB APIs. By the server for handling transactions, security, scalability and concurrency we have Wildﬂy application server. And on the client side, for creating graphical interfaces we use the ExtJS and Sencha Touch Framework, which are lightweight, high-performance libraries based on HTML 5, JavaScript and CSS 3. The report generator is JasperReports, because it has the ability to deliver rich content display and <b>printer.</b> The database <b>engine</b> is MySQL, because its connectivity, speed, and security make it a very appropriate server for access from the web. Finally, as editor of web and mobile applications, we have the integrated development environment Eclipse IDE platform of open source. In this paper we make a critical analysis of such applications and formulate the Framework of Software Architecture for {{the development and implementation of}} Web and Mobile Applications, which were implemented in the ECU 911 Babahoyo and at the Instituto Tecnologico Superior Babahoyo, proving through its application their effectiveness and efﬁciency in the implementation of integrated system...|$|R
