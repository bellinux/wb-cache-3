Acute pulmonary hypertension　was produced experimentally in 7 healthy mongrel dogs by injecting carbon grains suspemded in normal saline through a catheter placed in right ventricle. Increasing amounts of carbon grains were injected discontinuously　montitoring pulmonary artery mean pressure (Pam). Intraventricular pressure curve, right ventricular maximum rate of pressure elevation (Rvmaxdp/dt) and ECG were recorded when Pam reached to arbitrarily selected 3 to 7 levels. RVSTI consisting of preejection period (PEP), ejection time (ET) and PEP/ET were measured. In addition, Rvmaxdp/dt, time interval berween Q wave on ECG to Rvmaxdp/dt (Q-Rvmaxdp/dt), and (Q-Rvmaxdp/dt) -RVPEP were also determined. The results were as followings; 1. RVPEP increased correlatively with {{the elevation of}} pulmonary artery diastolic <b>pressure</b> (<b>Pad).</b> <b>2.</b> Increase of contractile forces of right ventricle {{was associated with the}} elevation of Pad. 3. Q-Rvmaxdp/dt did not increase when Pad was elevated sufficiently enough to cause inerease of RVPEP. 　 4. (Q-Rvmaxdp/dt) - RVPEP shifted from positive scores to negative scores when Pad was elevated.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Penetration of the {{mammary gland}} {{basement}} membrane by cancer cells {{is a crucial}} first step in tumor invasion. Using a mouse model of ductal carcinoma in situ, we previously found that inhibition of peptidylarginine deiminase <b>2</b> (<b>PAD</b> <b>2,</b> aka PADI 2) activity appears to maintain basement membrane integrity in xenograft tumors. The goal {{of this investigation was}} to gain insight into the mechanisms by which <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> mediates this process. METHODS: For our study, we modulated <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> activity in mammary ductal carcinoma cells by lentiviral shRNA-mediated depletion, lentiviral-mediated <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> overexpression, or <b>PAD</b> inhibition and explored the effects of these treatments on changes in cell migration and cell morphology. We also used these <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> -modulated cells to test whether <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> may be required for EGF-induced cell migration. To determine how <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> might promote tumor cell migration in vivo, we tested the effects of <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> inhibition on the expression of several cell migration mediators in MCF 10 DCIS. com xenograft tumors. In addition, we tested the effect of <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> inhibition on EGF-induced ductal invasion and elongation in primary mouse mammary organoids. Lastly, using a transgenic mouse model, we investigated the effects of <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> overexpression on mammary gland development. RESULTS: Our results indicate that <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> depletion or inhibition suppresses cell migration and alters the morphology of MCF 10 DCIS. com cells. In addition, we found that <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> depletion suppresses the expression of the cytoskeletal regulatory proteins RhoA, Rac 1, and Cdc 42 and also promotes a mesenchymal to epithelial-like transition in tumor cells with an associated increase in the cell adhesion marker, E-cadherin. Our mammary gland organoid study found that inhibition of <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> activity suppresses EGF-induced ductal invasion. In vivo, we found that <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> overexpression causes hyperbranching in the developing mammary gland. CONCLUSION: Together, these results suggest that <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> plays a critical role in breast cancer cell migration. Our findings that EGF treatment increases protein citrullination and that <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> inhibition blocks EGF-induced cell migration suggest that <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> likely functions within the EGF signaling pathway to mediate cell migration...|$|R
40|$|Peptidyl{{arginine}} Deiminases (PADs) convert arginine residues on substrate proteins to citrulline. Previous {{reports have}} documented that <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> expression and activity varies across the estrous cycle in the rodent uterus and pituitary gland, however, the expression {{and function of}} <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> in mammary tissue has not been previously reported. To gain more insight into potential reproductive roles for <b>PAD</b> <b>2,</b> {{in this study we}} evaluated <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> expression and localization throughout the estrous cycle in canine mammary tissue and then identified possible <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> enzymatic targets. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis found <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> expression is low in anestrus, limited to a distinct, yet sparse, subset of epithelial cells within ductal alveoli during estrus/early diestrus, and encompasses the entire epithelium of the mammary duct in late diestrus. At the subcellular level, <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> is expressed in the cytoplasm, and to a lesser extent, the nucleus of these epithelial cells. Surprisingly, stimulation of canine mammary tumor cells (CMT 25) shows that EGF, but not estrogen or progesterone, upregulates <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> transcription and translation suggesting EGF regulation of <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> and possibly citrullination in vivo. To identify potential <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> targets, anti-pan citrulline western blots were performed and results showed that citrullination activity is limited to diestrus with histones appearing to represent major enzymatic targets. Use of site-specific anticitrullinated histone antibodies found that the N-terminus of histone H 3, but not H 4, appears to be the primary target of PAD activity in mammary epithelium.

We hypothesised that <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> may {{play an important role}} in ovarian cancer and may provide utility as an independent prognostic marker. Method Using tissue microarrays of primary ovarian cancers and compiling a comprehensive database of clinicopathological variables, the expression of <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> was assessed by immunohistochemistry in discovery (n= 194) and validation (n= 360) cohorts using a monoclonal antibody specific for <b>PAD</b> <b>2.</b> Results Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that there was an association of <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> expression with overall survival in discovery (p= 0. 033) and validation cohorts (p= 0. 026). Upregulated expression of <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> was protective and in a multivariate model <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> expression remained an independent prognostic factor (p= 0. 029). <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> expression was associated with known regulators of autophagy (HMGB 1 and BCL 2) and immune surveillance (HLA and IFGR 1).

In this study, we examined PAD-mediated citrullination {{and its effect}} on pro-inflammatory activity in the macrophage cell line RAW 264. 7. Citrullination of 45 – 65 -kDa proteins was induced when cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 μg/ml). Protein citrullination was suppressed by the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA/AM (30 μm). LPS treatment up-regulated COX- 2 levels in cells. Interestingly, overexpressing <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> reduced LPS-mediated COX- 2 up-regulation by 50 %. <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> overexpression also reduced NF-κB activity, determined by NF-κB-driven luciferase activity. The effect of <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> on NF-κB activity was further examined by using HEK 293 cells transfected with NF-κB luciferase, IκB β/γ kinase (IKKβ/γ) subunits, and <b>PAD</b> <b>2.</b> IKKβ increased NF-κB activity, but this increase was markedly suppressed when <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> was present in cells. IKKβ-mediated NF-κB activation was further enhanced by IKKγ in the presence of calcium ionophore A 23187. However, this stimulatory effect of IKKβ/γ was abolished by <b>PAD</b> <b>2.</b> Coimmunoprecipitation of cell lysates showed that IKKγ and <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> can coimmunoprecipitate {{in the presence of the}} Ca 2 + ionophore. IKKγ coimmunoprecipitated truncation mutants, <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> (1 – 385) and <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> (355 – 672).

40|$|Citrullination, {{which is}} catalyzed by protein {{arginine}} deiminases (PADs 1 - 4 and 6), is a post-translational modification (PTM) that effectively neutralizes the positive {{charge of a}} guanidinium group by its replacement with a neutral urea. Given the sequence similarity of <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> across mammalian species and the genomic organization of the <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> gene, <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> is predicted to be the ancestral homologue of the <b>PADs.</b> Although <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> {{has long been known}} {{to play a role in}} myelination, it has only recently been linked to other cellular processes, including gene transcription and macrophage extracellular trap formation.

5000|$|The No 7 Mk 1 Dingbat mine is a British anti-personnel blast mine. The mine has a steel body, with a {{flexible}} <b>pressure</b> <b>pad</b> {{on the top}} surface. Under the <b>pressure</b> <b>pad</b> is a belleville spring with a central striker. The fuse is slid {{into the side of}} the mine, a firing pin prevents the fuse being fully inserted until it is removed. The mine was intended to be scattered mechanically, and a number of systems were tested to scatter it. However, none were accepted into service, so the Dingbat mine was hand laid instead. The mine came with a small fabric cover to help hide it.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE. Proteomic {{analyses}} of normal and glaucomatous human optic nerve were pursued for {{insights into the}} molecular pathology of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Peptidyl arginine deiminase <b>2</b> (<b>PAD</b> <b>2),</b> an enzyme that converts protein arginine to citrulline, was found only in POAG optic nerve and was probed further for a mechanistic role in glaucoma. METHODS. Protein identification used liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry. Northern, Western, and immunohistochemical analyses measured <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> expression and/or protein citrullination and arginyl methylation in human and mouse optic nerve and in astrocyte cultures before and after pressure treatment. Proteins were identified after anticitrulline immunoprecipitation. In vitro translation of <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> was monitored in polyA RNA depleted optic nerve extracts. <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> shRNA transfections were evaluated in pressure-treated astrocytes...|$|R

40|$|Protein {{arginine}} deiminases (PADs) are calcium-dependent histone-modifying enzymes whose {{activity is}} dysregulated in inflammatory diseases and cancer. <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> functions as an Estrogen Receptor (ER) coactivator {{in breast cancer}} cells via the citrullination of histone tail arginine residues at ER binding sites. Although an attractive therapeutic target, the mechanisms that regulate <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> activity are largely unknown, especially the detailed role of how calcium facilitates enzyme activation. To gain insights into these regulatory processes, we determined the first structures of <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> (27 in total), and through calcium-titrations by X-ray crystallography, determined the order of binding and affinity for the six calcium ions that bind and activate this enzyme. These structures also identified several <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> regulatory elements, including a calcium switch that controls proper positioning of the catalytic cysteine residue, and a novel active site shielding mechanism. Additional biochemical and mass-spectrometry-based hydrogen/deuterium exchange studies support these structural findings. The identification of multiple intermediate calcium-bound structures along the <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> activation pathway provides critical insights that will aid the development of allosteric inhibitors targeting the PADs...|$|R
40|$|Cofactors for {{estrogen}} receptor alpha (ERalpha) can modulate gene {{activity by}} posttranslationally modifying histone tails at target promoters. Here, {{we found that}} stimulation of ERalpha-positive cells with 17 beta-estradiol (E 2) promotes global citrullination of histone H 3 arginine 26 (H 3 R 26) on chromatin. Additionally, {{we found that the}} H 3 citrulline 26 (H 3 Cit 26) modification colocalizes with ERalpha at decondensed chromatin loci surrounding the estrogen-response elements of target promoters. Surprisingly, we also found that citrullination of H 3 R 26 is catalyzed by peptidylarginine deiminase (<b>PAD)</b> <b>2</b> and not by PAD 4 (which citrullinates H 4 R 3). Further, we showed that <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> interacts with ERalpha after E 2 stimulation and that inhibition of either <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> or ERalpha strongly suppresses E 2 -induced H 3 R 26 citrullination and ERalpha recruitment at target gene promoters. Collectively, our data suggest that E 2 stimulation induces the recruitment of <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> to target promoters by ERalpha, whereby <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> then citrullinates H 3 R 26, which leads to local chromatin decondensation and transcriptional activation...|$|R
40|$|Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs), {{which are}} a group of posttranslational {{modification}} enzymes, are involved in protein citrullination (deimination) by the conversion of peptidylarginine to peptidylcitrulline in a calcium concentration-dependent manner. Among the <b>PADs,</b> <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> is widely distributed in various tissues {{and is the only}} type that is expressed in brain. To elucidate the involvement of protein citrullination by <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> in the pathogenesis of brain-specific prion diseases, we examined the profiles of citrullinated proteins using the brains of scrapie-infected mice as a prion disease model. We found that, compared with controls, increased levels of citrullinated proteins of various molecular weights were detected in different brain sections of scrapie-infected mice. In support of this data, expression levels of <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> protein as well as its enzyme activity were significantly increased in brain sections of scrapie-infected mice, including hippocampus, brain stem, and striatum. Additionally, the expression levels of <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> mRNA were increased during scrapie infection. Moreover, <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> immunoreactivity was increased in scrapie-infected brains, with staining detected primarily in reactive astrocytes. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, various citrullinated proteins were identified in the brains of scrapie-infected mice, including glial fibrillary acidic protein, myelin basic protein, enolases, and aldolases. This study suggests that accumulated citrullinated proteins and abnormal activation of <b>PAD</b> <b>2</b> may function in the pathogenesis of prion diseases and serve as potential therapeutic targets...|$|R
