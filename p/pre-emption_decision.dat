40|$|Firms {{are often}} confronted with {{regulations}} on their productive and commercial activities. In many instances a firm can take various actions to pre-empt regulations. This article determines the optimality of pre-emptive action for a firm subject to natural resource regulation. The regulation may be either fixed or {{relative to the}} production history. Dependent {{on the type of}} regulation, a firm can pre-empt by terminating its current use of resources and converting to other use or by building up the input use or output history in the period prior to regulation. It is shown that the optimal <b>pre-emption</b> <b>decision</b> depends on the extent and perceived probability of regulation, on the rate of discount and on technological characteristics of the production process including the alternative use of the resource.

40|$|In recent years, {{courts have}} applied the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (2 ̆ 2 ERISA 2 ̆ 2) to {{pre-empt}} an increasingly wide scope of state laws, with {{the effect of}} limiting remedies of plan participants and beneficiaries and frustrating state health care reform efforts. Professor Jordan argues that the recent Supreme Court decision in New York State Conference of Blue Cross 2 ̆ 6 Blue Shield v. Travelers Insurance Co. is a signal from the Court that ERISA pre-emption should be applied more narrowly. She first analyzes the Court 2 ̆ 7 s prior <b>pre-emption</b> <b>decisions</b> and identifies delimiting language unheeded by lower courts. She then explores the impact of Travelers on ERISA preemption analysis, finding the decision renews emphasis on the historical presumption against pre-empting laws within state police power and takes a more pragmatic approach to discerning congressional intent regarding ERISA pre-emption. Finally, by examining certain emerging pre-emption issues, namely those involving provider taxes and contract and tort claims she assesses {{the effectiveness of the}} analytical framework derived from Travelers and prior Supreme Court cases in restraining the scope of ERISA pre-emption. Professor Jordan concludes that the framework can effectively restrain findings of preemption and should lead to more rational <b>pre-emption</b> <b>decisions...</b>|$|R
40|$|The federal {{framework}} for regulating {{genetically modified organisms}} (GMOs) has long been criticized as fragmented and inadequate to protect against various health, environmental, and economic concerns. Yet, despite having the legal authority to augment the federal framework, {{the overwhelming majority of}} states have failed to enact any substantive legislation governing GMOs at the state-level. In the wake of this regulatory vacuum, a small but growing number of local governments have attempted to regulate GMOs locally. However, local GMO regulations face significant challenges by the GMO industry, which has sought to undo local regulatory authority both through the courts and through industry lobbying of state legislators to expressly pre-empt local regulation. Today, roughly 17 states have now expressly pre-empted local authority to regulate GMOs, largely due to industry influence. Hawaii is a high-stakes battleground for the genetically modified debate, and in 2013 - 2014, three local counties—Maui County, Hawaii County, and Kauai County—all attempted to regulate GMOs at the local level. Although the counties purportedly had broad statutory authority to regulate to protect local health, life, and property, as well as conservation obligations under the Hawaii Constitution, the local GMO ordinances were quickly challenged in court by the GMO industry and soon invalidated by the federal district court in Hawaii on novel state and federal pre-emption grounds. As the very first local GMO regulations struck down on state and federal pre-emption grounds, the Hawaii <b>pre-emption</b> <b>decisions</b> will likely have a significant adverse impact on local GMO regulation across the country if allowed to stand. This article argues that the recent <b>pre-emption</b> <b>decisions</b> were wrongly decided under traditional pre-emption principles, and further argues that in the absence of state or federal comprehensive regulatory schemes sufficient to address mounting health, environmental, and economic concerns, courts and states should refrain from denying local authority to regulate GMOs. Permitting local regulation of GMOs not only fosters and supports legitimate local democracy, but it may also be what is most needed to find innovative solutions to acknowledged GMO risks and realities...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} irreversible {{investment in}} a project with uncertain returns, {{when there is an}} advantage to being the first to invest, and externalities to investing when others also do so. Pre-emption decreases and may even eliminate the option values created by irreversibility and uncertainty. Externalities introduce ine#ciencies in investment <b>decisions.</b> <b>Pre-emption</b> and externalities combined can actually hasten, rather than delay investment, contrary to the usual outcome. These facts demonstrate the importance of extending `real options' analysis to include strategic interactions...|$|R
