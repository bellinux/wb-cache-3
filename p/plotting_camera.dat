40|$|In 2005, the Home Box Office and British Broadcasting Corporation partnered {{to produce}} Rome, a {{television}} series that retells the Roman histories of Julius Caesar, Marc Antony and Augustus through {{the lives of}} two centurion soldiers, Titus Pullo and Lucious Vorenus. The show 2 ̆ 7 s producers endeavored to bring Roman streets to life and included more storylines of women, men and children of all classes. At first considered a more egalitarian approach to history, Rome 2 ̆ 7 s women are said to 2 ̆ 2 challenge expectations 2 ̆ 2 (Vu, 2005) and 2 ̆ 2 forge a new path 2 ̆ 2 (Ragalie, 2007, p. 2). But does this new representation challenge the old, sexist thinking that governed ancient Rome (and that continues to limit gender roles in modern society) ? Or does it reify it? This semiotic, feminist analysis of the HBO television series, Rome, asks how the show reifies and critiques patriarchal ideals. It compares the way brotherhood and sisterhood are framed through narrative and visual elements, like characterization, dialogue, <b>plot,</b> <b>camera</b> angle and color. The asexual, same-sex relationships between Pullo and Vorenus and Atia and Servilia are selected as signifiers of brotherhood and sisterhood. The difference in the portrayal of brotherhood and sisterhood illustrates ways that patriarchal ideals are articulated, and feminist ideals are oppressed, in popular culture representations. This thesis argues that even though Rome 2 ̆ 7 s producers claim to 2 ̆ 2 {{set the stage for}} modern politics [...] infighting, corruption, 2 ̆ 2 the way that they set the stage, ironically, critiques contemporary ideas about gender and endorses the base upon which the corruption is built [...] patriarchy. By critiquing Rome, this thesis contributes to feminist media studies scholarship by showing how patriarchy is portrayed in media and how those messages contribute to our perception of sexist politics...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to survey the species of large and {{medium-sized}} terrestrial mammals occurring at Serra do Brigadeiro State Park (SBSP). Data was compiled from two studies carried out in 2008. Data was collected through sand <b>plots</b> and <b>camera</b> traps. Thirteen species were recorded, one that had not been registered before (Leopardus wiedii) and one exotic (Canis lupus familiaris). Species richness estimate for camera trapping was 13. 53 ± 1. 75. For the sand plots, estimate was lower (9 ± 1. 73 species). The low number of inventories focusing on large and medium-sized terrestrial mammals in the Mantiqueira region of the Atlantic forest and the presence of the domestic dogs within the Park limits emphasizes the need for monitoring programs to identify the major threats to preserved areas in the region...|$|R
40|$|Terrestrial mammals are {{important}} components of lowland forests in Amazonia (as seed dispersal agents, herbivores, predators) {{but there are}} relatively few detailed studies from areas {{that have not been}} affected by human activities (e. g., hunting, logging). Yet, such information is needed to evaluate effects of humans elsewhere. We used camera traps to sample medium to large-sized terrestrial mammals at a site in lowland forests of eastern Ecuador, one of the most biologically rich areas in the world. We deployed cameras on two study plots in terra firme forest at Tiputini Biodiversity Station. Sixteen cameras were arranged 200 m apart in a 4  ×  4 grid on each <b>plot.</b> <b>Cameras</b> were operated for   60 days in January–March, 2014 – 2017, for a total of 3, 707 and 3, 482 trap-days on the two plots (Harpia, Puma). A total of 28 species were recorded; 26 on Harpia and 25 on Puma. Number of species recorded each year was slightly greater on Harpia whereas overall capture rates (images/ 100 trap-days) were higher on Puma. Although most species were recorded on each plot, differences in capture rates meant that yearly samples on a given plot were more similar to each other than to samples on the other plot. Images of most species showed a clumped distribution pattern on each plot; Panthera onca was the only species that did not show a clumped distribution on either plot. Images at a given camera location showed no evidence of autocorrelation with numbers of images at nearby camera locations, suggesting that species were responding to small-scale differences in habitat conditions. A redundancy analysis showed that environmental features within 50 or 100 m of camera locations (e. g., elevation, variation in elevation, slope, distance to streams) accounted for significant amounts of variation in distribution patterns of species. Composition and relative importance based on capture rates were very similar to results from cameras located along trails at the same site; similarities decreased at increasing spatial scales based on comparisons with results from other sites in Ecuador and Peru...|$|R

40|$|Activities {{involving}} fauna monitoring {{are usually}} {{limited by the}} lack of resources; therefore, the choice of a proper and efficient methodology is fundamental to maximize the cost-benefit ratio. Both direct and indirect methods can be used to survey mammals, but the latter are preferred due to the difficulty to come in sight of and/or to capture the individuals, besides being cheaper. We compared the performance of two methods to survey medium and large-sized mammal: track <b>plot</b> recording and <b>camera</b> trapping, and their costs were assessed. At Jatai Ecological Station (S 21 degrees 31 ` 15 ``- W 47 degrees 34 ` 42 ``-Brazil) we installed ten camera traps along a dirt road directly in front of ten track plots, and monitored them for 10 days. We cleaned the <b>plots,</b> adjusted the <b>cameras,</b> and noted down the recorded species daily. Records taken by both methods showed they sample the local richness in different ways (Wilcoxon, T= 231; p;; 0. 01). The track plot method performed better on registering individuals whereas camera trapping provided records which permitted more accurate species identification. The type of infra-red sensor camera used showed a strong bias towards individual body mass (R(2) = 0. 70; p= 0. 017), and the variable expenses of this method in a 10 -day survey were estimated about 2. 04 times higher compared to track plot method; however, in a long run camera trapping becomes cheaper than track plot recording. Concluding, track plot recording is good enough for quick surveys under a limited budget, and camera trapping is best for precise species identification and the investigation of species details, performing better for large animals. When used together, these methods can be complementary.

40|$|Relative {{abundance}} {{indices are}} widely applied to monitor wildlife populations. A general indexing paradigm {{was developed for}} structuring data collection and validly conducting analyses. This approach is applicable for many observation metrics, with observations made at stations through the area of interest and repeated over several days. The variance formula for the general index was derived using a linear mixed model, with statistical tests and confidence intervals constructed assuming Gaussian-distributed observations. However, many observation methods, like intrusions to track <b>plots</b> or <b>camera</b> traps, involve counts with many zeroes, producing Poisson-like observations. To fill this inferential gap between Gaussian analytical assumptions and Poisson-distributed data we evaluated, via a broad Monte Carlo simulation study, variance estimation and confidence interval coverage when Gaussian statistical inference is applied to data generated from a Poisson distribution. The mixed effects linear model assuming Gaussian observations performed well in estimating variances and confidence intervals when simulated Poisson data were in the range found in field studies (88 – 96 % confidence interval coverage). Estimation improved by {{increasing the number of}} observation days. Confidence interval coverage rates performed very well (even with few observation days) when day-to-day variability was small, while effective estimation resulted for a great range in station-to-station variability. These results provide a foundational basis for applying the general indexing paradigm to count data, strengthen the generality of the approach, provide valuable information for study design, and should reassure practitioners about the validity of their analytical inferences when using count data...|$|R

40|$|The silty soils of the intensively used {{agricultural}} {{landscape of the}} Saxon loess province, eastern Germany, are very prone to soil erosion, mainly caused by water erosion. Rainfall simulations, and also increasingly structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry, are used as methods in soil erosion research not only to assess soil erosion by water, but also to quantify soil loss. This study aims to validate SfM photogrammetry determined soil loss estimations with rainfall simulations measurements. Rainfall simulations were performed at three agricultural sites in central Saxony. Besides the measured data runoff and soil loss by sampling (in mm), terrestrial images {{were taken from the}} <b>plots</b> with digital <b>cameras</b> before and after the rainfall simulation. Subsequently, SfM photogrammetry was used to reconstruct soil surface changes due to soil erosion in terms of high resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) for the pre- and post-event (resolution 1 × 1 mm). By multi-temporal change detection, the digital elevation model of difference (DoD) and an averaged soil loss (in mm) is received, which was compared to the soil loss by sampling. Soil loss by DoD was higher than soil loss by sampling. The method of SfM photogrammetry-determined soil loss estimations also include a comparison of three different ground control point (GCP) approaches, revealing that the most complex one delivers the most reliable soil loss by DoD. Additionally, soil bulk density changes and splash erosion beyond the plot were measured during the rainfall simulation experiments in order to separate these processes and associated surface changes from the soil loss by DoD. Furthermore, splash was negligibly small, whereas higher soil densities after the rainfall simulations indicated soil compaction. By means of calculated soil surface changes due to soil compaction, the soil loss by DoD achieved approximately the same value as the soil loss by rainfall simulation...|$|R

40|$|OAK-B 135 This study {{took place}} at the Nevada Desert FACE (Free Air CO 2 Enrichment) Facility at the Nevada Test Site, where effects of {{elevated}} atmospheric CO 2 on a desert ecosystem are being studied. One hundred sixty-eight minirhizotrons (clear plastic tubes) were installed to a depth of 1 m in the soil in the control and elevated CO 2 plots. Tubes were installed from a suspended platform to avoid soil compaction and disturbance. Tubes were placed under individuals of two dominant shrub species, Larrea tridentata and Ambrosia dumosa, and along systematic transects across the <b>plots.</b> Specialized video <b>cameras</b> were inserted down the tubes at 4 week intervals to provide images of plant root systems on the upper side of the tube. A ratcheting mechanism assured consistent imaging of the same precise locations during each sampling period. Images were collected every 4 weeks from December 1997 to January 2001, after which the images were too degraded from repeated camera abrasion on the tubes for adequate analysis. Over 100, 000 video images were analyzed and the appearance, growth, and disappearance of 23, 634 individual fine roots (< 2 mm diameter) were tracked over time, totaling 125, 679 root observations and measurements. Elevated CO 2 did not {{have an effect on the}} timing of seasonal patterns of fine root growth or turnover (mortality). There were no consistent effects of elevated CO 2 on fine root length standing crop, production, or turnover except standing crop was consistently lower under the elevated CO 2 treatment across the community transects. The specific root length (m/g of root dry weight) found to be higher for Larrea and Ambrosia under elevated CO 2 treatments. Procedures were developed to translate the length measurements taken from minirhizotron images to biomass estimates per unit soil volume, utilizing these specific root length measurements. While few differences in fine root length were apparent as a result of elevated CO 2 treatment, conversion to biomass units indicated that elevated CO 2 led to decreases in fine root biomass, production, and turnover. This was an unexpected result since many elevated CO 2 studies have shown increases in below ground biomass allocation. No differences were found in fine root carbon or nitrogen concentrations, but lower biomass turnover under elevated CO 2 implies lower rates of C and N cycling through fine root turnover. Funds from this interagency agreement also allowed the development of improved software for image analysis, which will benefit other researchers using minirhizotrons to study below ground responses to elevated CO 2 or other treatments...|$|R
