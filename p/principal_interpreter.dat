50|$|He was an {{itinerant}} Chinese {{philosopher and}} sage, {{and one of}} the <b>principal</b> <b>interpreters</b> of Confucianism. Supposedly, he was a pupil of Confucius' grandson, Zisi. Like Confucius, according to legend, he travelled throughout China for forty years to offer advice to rulers for reform. During the Warring States period (403-221 BC), Mencius served as an official and scholar at the Jixia Academy in the State of Qi (1046 BC to 221 BC) from 319 to 312 BC. He expressed his filial devotion when he took three years leave of absence from his official duties for Qi to mourn his mother's death. Disappointed at his failure to effect changes in his contemporary world, he retired from public life.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 79 - 83) The dominant philosophical {{approach to}} Plato's dialogues is the mouthpiece interpretation {{according to which}} Plato intends to convey as his own in the dialogues, various theories, doctrines, and/or beliefs. Two <b>principal</b> <b>interpreters</b> of this approach are Richard Kraut and Julia Annas, each of whom upholds the respective tenets of the mouthpiece interpretation. Contrary to their views, I argue {{that some of the}} primary arguments for the mouthpiece approach to Plato are highly problematic and claim that, due to their misdirected analyses, mouthpiece interpreters are akin to the prisoners in Plato's cave. I argue (along with others) that the Socratic interpretation is a more promising approach by which to interpret Plato's dialogues insofar as it regards more heavily the influence of Socrates on Plato and (in particular) the significance of movement. I further suggest that the Socratic interpretation reveals a deeper reality about the human condition, as presented in the Allegory of the Cave. As such, it provides a unique and valuable means by which to understand the significance of reason and action in our lives...|$|R

50|$|The {{colony of}} Georgia {{was created in}} 1732; its first settlement, Savannah, was founded the {{following}} year, on a river bluff where the Yamacraw, a Yamasee band that remained allies of England, allowed John Musgrove to establish a fur-trading post. His wife Mary Musgrove {{was the daughter of}} an English trader and a Muscogee woman from the powerful Wind Clan, half-sister of 'Emperor' Brim. She was the <b>principal</b> <b>interpreter</b> for Georgia's founder and first Governor Gen. James Oglethorpe, using her connections to foster peace between the Creek Indians and the new colony.

The New Grove Dictionary cites his [...] "charismatic readings of Bartók and Schumann". He was regarded as the <b>principal</b> Bartók <b>interpreter</b> of his generation, even if other pianists since his death have made more obviously exciting recordings of that composer's concertos.

40|$|Chief Justice John Marshall 2 ̆ 7 s {{opinion in}} Marbury v. Madison is {{generally}} regarded as the cornerstone of American judicial review. Marshall 2 ̆ 7 s opinion in Marbury skillfully invoked the distinctive American concept of popular sovereignty and linked that concept to the written Constitution. Marshall argued that judicial review provided the best means for enforcing the people 2 ̆ 7 s will, as declared in the written Constitution, without resort to the drastic remedy of revolution. Marshall warned that, without judicial review, the legislative branch would enjoy a practical and real omnipotence and would reduce to nothing what we have deemed the greatest improvement on political institutions - a written constitution. In Marbury and subsequent cases, Marshall based his constitutional decisions on the supreme authority of the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s text. Marshall used interpretive canons drawn from the common law and natural law as helpful tools for defining {{the meaning of the}} Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s terms, but he avoided any direct reliance on unwritten principles of natural law. By portraying the Supreme Court as a faithful agent of the people 2 ̆ 7 s will embodied in the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s text, Marshall sought to encourage popular acceptance of the Court as the <b>principal</b> <b>interpreter</b> and guardian of the Constitution. In developing his theories of popular sovereignty and judicial review, Marshall drew upon the ideas of other Founders, including James Wilson. During the ratification of the Constitution, Wilson declared that the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s principles of popular consent represented the great panacea of human politics. By affirming {{the right of the people}} to mold [their government] into any shape they please, the Constitution provided a remedy for every distemper in government. While Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s concept of popular sovereignty was similar to Marshall 2 ̆ 7 s, Wilson advocated a far more ambitious role for the courts in the new federal republic. Wilson called upon American judges and lawyers to develop a new science of law based on principles of natural law and psychological insights furnished by the Scottish Enlightenment theories of moral sense and common sense. Wilson believed that this new legal science would enable judges to work in concert with jurors and elected officials in bringing society closer to the perfection intended by humankind 2 ̆ 7 s divine Creator. As judges performed their function of judicial review, Wilson contended that they must enforce applicable principles of natural law as well as the text and purposes of the Constitution. Thus, as Professor Robert McCloskey has observed, Wilson envisioned a grand moral consensus that would reconcile the venerable Western idea of a binding higher law with the relatively new idea of the will of the people. Wilson tried to persuade the public to accept his methodology for harmonizing natural law and popular sovereignty on three occasions - in defending the Framers 2 ̆ 7 decision to omit a bill of rights from the original Constitution, in deciding Chisholm v. Georgia, and in instructing the grand and petit juries in Henfield 2 ̆ 7 s Case. On all three occasions Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s efforts were rejected, and he was accused of undermining the Constitution, threatening the residuary sovereignty of the states, and subverting the liberties of the people. This article suggests several reasons why Wilson failed, and why Marshall rather than Wilson is remembered today as the principal founder of the American doctrine of judicial review...|$|E
