50|$|There {{are three}} main basic types of <b>filter</b> presses: <b>plate</b> and frame <b>filter</b> presses, {{recessed}} <b>plate</b> and frame <b>filter</b> presses and automatic filter presses.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>plate</b> {{and frame}} <b>filter</b> press {{is the most}} {{fundamental}} design, and many now refer it as a [...] "membrane filter plate". This type of filter press consists of many plates and frames assembled alternately with the supports {{of a pair of}} rails. The presence of a centrifuge pump ensures the remaining suspended solids do not settle in the system, and its main function is to deliver the suspension into each of the separating chambers in the <b>plate</b> and frame <b>filter.</b> For each of the individual separating chambers, there is one hollow filter frame separated from two <b>filter</b> <b>plates</b> by <b>filter</b> cloths. The introduced slurry flows through a port in each individual frame, and the filter cakes are accumulated in each hollow frame. As the filter cake becomes thicker, the filter resistance increases as well. So when the separating chamber is full, the filtration process is stopped as the optimum pressure difference is reached. The filtrate that passes through filter cloth is collected through collection pipes and stored in the filter tank. Filter cake (suspended solid) accumulation occurs at the hollow plate frame, then being separated at the <b>filter</b> <b>plates</b> by pulling the <b>plate</b> and frame <b>filter</b> press apart. The cakes then fall off from those plates and are discharged to the final collection point.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{specialized}} {{applications are}} associated with different types of filter press that are currently used in various industries. <b>Plate</b> <b>filter</b> press is extensively used in sugaring operations such as the production of maple syrup in Canada, since it offers very high efficiency and reliability. According to M.Isselhardt, [...] "appearance can affect the value of maple syrup and customer's perception of quality". This makes the raw syrup filtration process extremely crucial in achieving desired product with high quality and appealing form, which again suggested how highly appreciated filter press methods are in industry.|$|E
5000|$|Filter presses {{are used}} in a huge variety of {{different}} applications, from dewatering of mineral mining slurries to blood plasma purification. At the same time, filter press technology is widely established for ultrafine coal dewatering as well as filtrate recovery in coal preparation plants. According to G.Prat, the [...] "filter press is proven {{to be the most}} effective and reliable technique to meet today's requirement". One of the examples is Pilot scale <b>plate</b> <b>filter</b> press, which is specialized in dewatering coal slurries. In 2013 the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration published an article highlighting this specific application. It was mentioned that the use of the filter press is very beneficial to plant operations, since it offers dewatering ultraclean coal as product, as well as improving quality of water removed to be available for equipment cleaning.|$|E
5000|$|The first commercially {{successful}} color process, the Lumière Autochrome, {{invented by}} the French Lumière brothers, reached {{the market in}} 1907. It {{was based on an}} irregular screen <b>plate</b> <b>filter</b> made of dyed grains of potato starch which were too small to be individually visible. The light-sensitive emulsion was coated directly onto the screen, eliminating problems due to imperfect contact between the screen and image. Reversal processing was used to convert the negative image which was initially produced into a positive image, so no printing or screen registration was required. The shortcomings of the Autochrome process were the expense (one plate cost about as much as a dozen black-and-white plates of the same size), the relatively long exposure times which made hand-held [...] "snapshots" [...] and photographs of moving subjects impractical, and the density of the finished image due to the presence of the light-absorbing color screen.|$|E
40|$|Wave filters may be {{employed}} in laboratory facilities to attenuate oscillatory surface waves reflected from a test model, or {{to improve the quality}} of generated waves. When used for these purposes, they are placed between the generator and the test model, usually quite close to the generator. The studies reported herein consisted of experimental tests of the attenuation and reflection characteristics of <b>plate</b> and wire-mesh <b>filters.</b> The results indicated that high attenuations can be achieved with either type filter without serious reflections. The attenuation and reflection depend, in addition to other factors, upon the plate spacing of <b>plate</b> type <b>filters</b> and the porosity of wire-mesh filters. Very dense or closely spaced filters produced high attenuations and high reflections. The best over-all performance was obtained by plate spacings or porosities selected to utilizee a filter length equal to or in excess of the wave length. Reflection produced by <b>plate</b> <b>filters</b> depended, to a considerable extent, on the blockage or reduction in cross-section of the channel, as well as on the ratio of wave length to filter length. Reflections from <b>plate</b> <b>filters</b> were reduced when the filter was constructed of plates of various lengths. The experimental results were compared with available theory. Very good agreement was obtained with the plate-type filter when the spacing was not too small. Brief comparisons between the data on wire-mesh filters and two suggested theories were not successful. The majority of the filter tests were conducted in a relatively small wave channel. limited tests were conducted on wire-mesh filters in a large channel; a comparison of data from the two sources indicated that porosity was not the sole factor affecting the attenuation and that the resistance of the wire mesh probably varied as a function of Reynolds number.

50|$|A {{recessed}} <b>plate</b> <b>filter</b> {{press is}} made up of polypropylene squares at about 2 to 4 feet across with a concave depression and a hole in the center of each. Two plates join together to form a chamber to pressurize the slurry and squeeze the filtrate out through the filter cloth lining in the chamber. It is capable of holding 12 to 80 plates adjacent to each other, depending on the required capacity. When the filter press is closed, a series of chambers is formed. The differences with the plate and frame filter are that the plates are joined together {{in such a way that}} the cake forms in the recess on each plate, meaning that the cake thickness is restricted to 32mm unless extra frames are used as spacers. However, there are disadvantages to this method, such as longer cloth changing time, inability to accommodate filter papers, and the possibility of forming uneven cake.|$|E

40|$|Work on the {{development}} of an improved 183 GHz subharmonic mixer was concentrated in two areas. First, there was an improved performance from current mixer body designs by testing different diodes and varying the whisker lengths. Second, there is the design of a new body structure. The whisker and diode pinsare in the same piece of the mixer that holds the substrate, reducing any motion of the parts that form the ohmic contacts of the diodes circuit. The broadband, low loss, quasi-optical diplexer, which is designed for use with a single ended mixer, has been developed. It uses a Gaussian beam waveguide as its transmission medium. The difference between the diplexer and other diplexers is the use of a Fabry Perot parallel <b>plate</b> <b>filter.</b> One is a multichannel radiometer system.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of the accidental or deliberate release of genetically engineered microorganisms into the environment has accentuated the need to study their survival in, and effect on, natural habitats. In this study, Pseudomonas putida UWC 1 harboring a non-self-transmissible plasmid, pD 10, encoding the breakdown of 3 -chlorobenzoate was shown {{to survive in a}} fully functioning laboratory-scale activated-sludge unit (ASU) for more than 8 weeks. The ASU maintained a healthy, diverse protozoal population throughout the experiment, and the introduced strain did not adversely affect the functioning of the unit. Although plasmid pD 10 was stably maintained in the host bacterium, the introduced strain did not enhance the degradation of 3 -chlorobenzoate in the ASU. When reisolated from the ASU, derivatives of strain UWC 1 (pD 10) were identified which were able to transfer plasmid pD 10 to a recipient strain, P. putida PaW 340, indicating the in situ transfer of mobilizing plasmids from the indigenous population to the introduced strain. Results from <b>plate</b> <b>filter</b> matings showed that bacteria present in the activated-sludge population could act as recipients for plasmid pD 10 and actively expressed genes carried on the plasmid.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a number of}} experimental results of suction-controlled triaxial tests on a compacted weakly expansive soil with different suctions and suction histories. In terms of suction control methods, the high suction level (from 3. 29 to 38 MPa) was realized by the vapor equilibrium technique and the low suction level (from 0 to 800 kPa) was controlled by the axis translation technique. Results of the triaxial tests indicate that the specimen with higher suction shows higher strength and lower contractive and higher dilative volumetric strains, and the average skeleton stress ratio (q/p=) at failure decreases with increasing suction in the high suction range (3. 29 ~ 38 MPa). Given that suction during shearing is constant (e. g., 200 kPa), the specimen dried to a higher suction and the history shows higher strength and lower contractive volumetric strain. Experimental results also show that high pre-applied suction (i. e., the maximum suction in the history) can lead to peak strength, post-peak softening, and shear dilation. Three different methods (pressure <b>plate,</b> <b>filter</b> paper, and vapor equilibrium) were employed to study the soil-water retention behaviour of the unsaturated expansive soil. Test results indicate that by combining these three different methods, {{it is possible to}} determine the SWCC in the entire suction range (0 ~ 367 MPa).

According to the antibacterial characteristics, the most efficient one will be the uncooked crushed garlic.

40|$|A {{fluidized}} bed gasification (FBG) pilot plant {{was designed and}} constructed at the University of Saskatchewan Chemical Engineering Department Fluidization Laboratory. FBG is a thermo-chemical method for converting solid biomass to a gaseous fuel, termed syngas. Several instrumentation and control issues were particularly challenging with this pilot plant, including development of the fuel feeding system, pressure measurement of high temperature fluids, and metering of steam as a process reactant. The fuel feeding system was tested using MBM (meat and bone meal) to determine the output rate stability, and predictability and measurability of the system as the components in the fuel feeding system were integrated. The fuel feeding system that was tested included a 150 mm primary metering screw conveyor, a 150 mm rotary airlock, and a 50 mm secondary injection screw conveyor. Each component of the system was fitted with a 3 -phase electric motor and a variable speed drive {{to allow for a}} variable output rate. The weighing system that was integral to the metering conveyor was tested as well, but upon pressurizing the metering conveyor and hopper, the weighing system sustained an unreasonable amount of noise. Integrating a pneumatic injection nozzle with the injection conveyor was found to work effectively both under ambient temperatures and hot FBG conditions up to 725 oC. Above 725 oC, {{it was found that the}} test fuel would char and coat the nozzle, causing it to plug. Testing of the feeding system with the injection nozzle removed illustrated that the system could work well without it. It was determined that the injection conveyor speed to metering conveyor speed ratio that should be used for this system was 1 : 110 for absolute rotational speeds, or 1 : 1 of the full conveyor speeds. The complete system, including the injection nozzle, was analyzed and determined to produce a fuel output rate (FS) for % speeds from 5 - 25 %, which roughly corresponded to the desired plant fuel feed rate of 1 - 5 g/s. Techniques for remote pressure measurement of {{fluidized bed}}s were examined as well, including the use of long tubes to cool hot gases and filters for blocking solid particles. The pressure measurement delay of these techniques was examined in comparison to a direct local measurement. This was conducted by comparing the pressure readings from two identical sensors; one mounted directly to a manifold, and the other mounted via a variable assembly (comprised of a variable length of 6. 35 mm (1 / 4 ") PE tubing and a porous <b>plate</b> <b>filter).</b> Assemblies without a porous plate were found to have a minimal delay of up to 0. 303 seconds for 30 m length of PE impulse tubing. More significant delays were found for systems using both a 10 media grade porous <b>plate</b> <b>filter</b> and impulse tubing; a 3 m tube length with filter has a delay of up to 0. 221 s, and a 30 m impulse tube combined with the filter has a measurement delay of up to 1. 915 s, a significant delay in cases where high-frequency analysis of pressure is used for bed agglomeration prediction, or systems where fast response is required to changing pressure conditions. Additionally, a steam flow measurement system using an orifice plate and differential pressure sensor was installed and calibrated. By collecting time-based steam samples and process data, the physical system coefficients were determined for this system, allowing for steam flow measurement, accurate within 5 % over a flow range of 0. 5 to 2. 0 g/s...|$|E

40|$|Reliable, {{maintainable}} {{and cost}} effective hot gas particulate filter technology {{is critical to}} the successful commercialization of advanced, coal-fired power generation technologies, such as IGCC and PFBC. In pilot plant testing, the operating reliability of hot gas particulate filters have been periodically compromised by process issues, such as process upsets and difficult ash cake behavior (ash bridging and sintering), and by design issues, such as cantilevered filter elements damaged by ash bridging, or excessively close packing of filtering surfaces resulting in unacceptable pressure drop or filtering surface plugging. This test experience has focused the issues and has helped to define advanced hot gas filter design concepts that offer higher reliability. Westinghouse has identified two advanced ceramic barrier filter concepts that are configured to minimize the possibility of ash bridge formation and to be robust against ash bridges should they occur. The ''inverted candle filter system'' uses arrays of thin-walled, ceramic candle-type filter elements with inside-surface filtering, and contains the filter elements in metal enclosures for complete separation from ash bridges. The ''sheet filter system'' uses ceramic, flat <b>plate</b> <b>filter</b> elements supported from vertical pipe-header arrays that provide geometry that avoids the buildup of ash bridges and allows free fall of the back-pulse released filter cake. The Optimization of Advanced Filter Systems program is being conducted to evaluate these two advanced designs and to ultimately demonstrate one of the concepts in pilot scale. In the Base Contract program, the subject of this report, Westinghouse has developed conceptual designs of the two advanced ceramic barrier filter systems to assess their performance, availability and cost potential, and to identify technical issues that may hinder the commercialization of the technologies. A plan for the Option I, bench-scale test program has also been developed based on the issues identified. The two advanced barrier filter systems have been found to have the potential to be significantly more reliable and less expensive to operate than standard ceramic candle filter system designs. Their key development requirements are the assessment of the design and manufacturing feasibility of the ceramic filter elements, and the small-scale demonstration of their conceptual reliability and availability merits...|$|E
