5|$|While {{scholars}} {{have proposed a}} number of hypotheses {{to explain why the}} poem was written, a definitive answer to this question remains elusive. But regardless of Proba's intent, there is evidence that the poem was widely circulated, and it eventually was used in schools to teach the tenets of Christianity, alongside Augustine of Hippo's De Doctrina Christiana. Critical reception to the poem, however, was more mixed. A <b>pseudonymous</b> <b>work</b> purportedly by Pope Gelasius I disparaged the poem, deeming it apocryphal. Many also believe that St. Jerome disliked the poem. At the same time, others like Isidore of Seville, Petrarch, and Giovanni Boccaccio wrote highly of Proba. During the 19th and 20th centuries the poem was criticized as being of poor quality, but recent {{scholars have}} written more positively about it.|$|E
25|$|Barbu Nemțeanu (pen name of Benjamin Deutsch; October 1, 1887 – May 30, 1919) was a Romanian poet, humorist and translator, {{active on}} the modernist {{wing of the}} Romanian Symbolist movement. Of Jewish Romanian background, he lived {{much of his life}} in the port city of Galați, which {{provided}} him with poetic inspiration, but whose provincial life sparked in him intellectual revolt. Orphaned and leaving school at an early age, then diagnosed with tuberculosis, he found meager employment as a clerk, but, throughout, maintained confidence in his poetic genius. Nemțeanu's Symbolism blended with socialism, but also with a lasting admiration for his adoptive Romanian culture, allowing him to publish <b>pseudonymous</b> <b>work</b> in traditionalist-antisemitic reviews such as Neamul Românesc. He {{was also one of the}} Symbolists who frequented the Convorbiri Critice circle, becoming personal friends with its leader, Mihail Dragomirescu.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the title}} suggests, the Postscript is {{sequel to the}} earlier Philosophical Fragments. The title {{of the work is}} ironic because the Postscript is almost five times larger than the Fragments. The Postscript credits [...] "Johannes Climacus" [...] as the author and Kierkegaard as its editor. Like his other <b>pseudonymous</b> <b>works,</b> the Postscript is not a {{reflection}} of Kierkegaard's own beliefs. However, unlike his other <b>pseudonymous</b> <b>works,</b> Kierkegaard attaches his name as editor to this work, showing the importance of the Postscript to Kierkegaard's overall authorship.|$|R

5000|$|Paralleling God-as-conjurer, hoodoo {{practitioners}} often {{understand the}} biblical figure Moses in similar terms. Hurston developed this idea in her novel Moses, Man of the Mountain, {{in which she}} calls Moses, [...] "the finest hoodoo man in the world." [...] Obvious parallels between Moses and intentional paranormal influence (such as magic) occur in the biblical accounts of his confrontation with Pharaoh. Moses conjures, or performs magic [...] "miracles" [...] such as turning his staff into a snake. However, his greatest feat of conjure was using his powers to help free the Hebrews from slavery. This emphasis on Moses-as-conjurer led {{to the introduction of}} the <b>pseudonymous</b> <b>work</b> the Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses into the corpus of hoodoo reference literature.|$|E

5000|$|Wakley did {{all that}} he could, as editor of The Lancet, and as an individual, to oppose Elliotson, and to place all of his {{endeavours}} and enterprises in the worst possible light; for example, {{in addition to an}} extensive range of articles in The Lancet, over a number of years, there is also an anti-Elliotson (<b>pseudonymous)</b> <b>work</b> attributed to Wakley, Undeniable facts concerning the strange practices of Dr. Elliotson, ... with his female patients; and his medical experiments upon the bodies of ...

50|$|After the Lapland expedition, Maupertuis {{set about}} generalising his earlier {{mathematical}} work, proposing {{the principle of}} least action as a metaphysical principle that underlies all the laws of mechanics. He also expanded into the biological realm, anonymously publishing a book that was part popular science, part philosophy, and part erotica: Vénus physique. In that work, Maupertuis proposed a theory of generation (i.e., reproduction) in which organic matter possessed a self-organizing “intelligence” that was analogous to the contemporary chemical concept of affinities, which was widely read and commented upon favourably by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. He later developed his views on living things further in a more formal <b>pseudonymous</b> <b>work</b> that explored heredity, collecting evidence that confirmed the contributions of both sexes and treated variations as statistical phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Many of Kierkegaard's earlier {{writings}} from 1843 to 1846 {{were written}} pseudonymously. In the non-pseudonymous The Point of View of My Work as an Author, {{he explained that}} the <b>pseudonymous</b> <b>works</b> are written from perspectives which are not his own: while Kierkegaard himself was a religious author, the pseudonymous authors wrote from points of view that were aesthetic or speculative. One exception to this is Anti-Climacus, a pseudonymous author developed after the writing of The Point of View: Anti-Climacus is a religious author who writes from a Christian perspective so ideal that Kierkegaard did not wish it to be attributed to himself.|$|R
25|$|The {{copyright}} {{term was}} extended from 25 years to generally 50 years p.m.a. {{for all kinds}} of works, and the law for the first time made explicit that no formalities were required for a work to be copyrighted.

The moral rights to authorship, name, and integrity of the work were perpetual; and authors could only transfer usage rights on a work (but not their right to remuneration for such uses, which always remained a personal right of the author).|$|R
2500|$|Farmer is {{best known}} for his {{sequences}} of novels, especially the World of Tiers (1965–93) and Riverworld (1971–83) series. He is noted for the pioneering use of sexual and religious themes in his work, his fascination for, and reworking of, the lore of celebrated pulp heroes, and occasional tongue-in-cheek <b>pseudonymous</b> <b>works</b> written as if by fictional characters. Farmer often mixed real and classic fictional characters and worlds and real and fake authors as epitomized by his Wold Newton family group of books. These tie all classic fictional characters together as real people and blood relatives resulting from an alien conspiracy. Such works as The Other Log of Phileas Fogg (1973) and [...] (1973) are early examples of literary mashup.|$|R
5000|$|However, works written under a {{false name}} {{would have been}} very {{problematic}} since the early church clearly excluded from the apostolic canon any works they thought to be pseudonymous. While critics point to the common practice of pseudonymous writing in the ancient world, they usually fail to point out that this practice, though common in the culture, was not common in personal letters, and was categorically rejected by the early church (cf. 2 Thess. 2:2; 3:17; also Muratorian Canon 64-67; Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History 6.12.3). Tertullian (c. a.d. 160-225) wrote that when it was discovered that a church elder had composed a <b>pseudonymous</b> <b>work,</b> The Acts of Paul (which included a purported Pauline letter, 3 Corinthians), the offending elder [...] "was removed from his office" [...] (On Baptism 17).|$|E

5000|$|Another author, 90 years later, {{related the}} Discourses to Kierkegaard's other works. [...] Since the <b>pseudonymous</b> <b>works</b> {{are in the}} form of “indirect communication,” they stand in need of interpretation, and the Discourses, which always were {{in the form of}} “direct communication,” afford in some {{instances}} (especially in the case of Repetition, Fear and Trembling, and the Stages) a very precious and specific illumination of S.K.’s meaning, not merely a proof of his religious intent in general.Reviewers were enthralled with Fear and Trembling and Repetition. The discourses present modes of thought that are conducive to the Spiritual world where forgiveness overcomes wrath. Revenge is always sweet.
