The <b>prime</b> <b>ministers</b> of all the self-governing dominions were invited to London for the festivities.

Until the late 20th century, the <b>Prime</b> <b>Ministers</b> and Chief Justices of Canada and Australia were also appointed Privy Counsellors.

5|$|Due to {{the gradual}} {{evolution}} of the post of Prime Minister, the title is applied to early <b>Prime</b> <b>Ministers</b> only retrospectively; this has sometimes given rise to academic dispute. Lord Bath and Lord Waldegrave are both sometimes listed as <b>prime</b> <b>ministers.</b> Bath was invited to form a ministry by King George II when Henry Pelham resigned in 1746, as was Waldegrave in 1757 after the dismissal of William Pitt the Elder, who dominated the government during the Seven Years' War.
