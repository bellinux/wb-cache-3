5|$|Aristotle Onassis's will {{established}} a charitable foundation {{in memory of}} his son, the Alexander S. Onassis <b>Public</b> <b>Benefit</b> Foundation, based in the tax haven of Vaduz in Liechtenstein, and headquartered in Athens. The foundation received 45% of his fortune, with the remainder left to Alexander's sister, Christina. The foundation consists of two parts; a business foundation which runs various businesses including shipping, and a <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> foundation which is the sole recipient of the business foundation. The <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> foundation funds the worldwide promotion of Greek culture, funds the Onassis International Prizes for achievement in various fields, and the funding of scholarships for Greek university students.|$|E

5|$|Charitable trusts in English law are {{a form of}} {{express trust}} {{dedicated}} to charitable goals. There {{are a variety of}} advantages to charitable trust status, including exception from most forms of tax and freedom for the trustees not found in other types of English trust. To be a valid charitable trust, the organisation must demonstrate both a charitable purpose and a <b>public</b> <b>benefit.</b> Applicable charitable purposes are normally divided into categories for <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> including the relief of poverty, the promotion of education, the advancement of health and saving of lives, promotion of religion and all other types of trust recognised by the law. There is also a requirement that the trust's purposes benefit the public (or some section of the public), and not simply a group of private individuals.|$|E
40|$|This {{study used}} Survey of Income and Program Participation data {{to examine whether}} receipt of <b>public</b> <b>benefits</b> and private sources of {{assistance}} among low-income families with children eliminated their perceived need for pubic <b>benefits</b> or additional <b>public</b> <b>benefits,</b> because income was too low to meet basic needs. We also identified barriers to accessing <b>public</b> <b>benefits.</b> Results indicated that only 23 % of the sample received <b>public</b> <b>benefits</b> and had no additional need, and the more <b>public</b> <b>benefits</b> families received {{the more likely they}} were to perceive unmet need. These findings suggest that a main goal of <b>public</b> <b>benefits</b> programs-to meet the basic needs of low-income families with children-is not being met. Families anticipating assistance from extended family, friends, or organizations were less likely to perceive a need for <b>public</b> <b>benefits</b> than families anticipating little or no assistance. However, families actually receiving assistance from extended family and friends increased the likelihood of perceiving such a need, compared with families who received none, suggesting that private assistance also is insufficient to meet these families' basic needs. Eligibility criteria, lack of knowledge, bureaucratic hassle, and social stigma were common barriers to accessing <b>public</b> <b>benefits.</b> Implications for social work practice and policy are discussed. <b>Public</b> <b>benefits</b> Private assistance Social support Barriers to accessing <b>public</b> <b>benefits</b> Unmet needs Need for <b>public</b> <b>benefits</b> Poverty...|$|R

The study drew on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Maryland statistical reports. The gain is attributable to savings in expenditures on means-tested <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> programs and an increase in sales and lodging tax revenue from weddings and wedding-related tourism.|$|E
5|$|Although San Francisco {{had sought}} Tuolumne River water {{as early as}} the 1890s, this project did not move forward until the {{disastrous}} earthquake and fire of 1906, which underscored the insufficiency of the existing water supply. The Hetch Hetchy Valley – then compared to Yosemite Valley for its scenic beauty – was chosen for its water quality and hydroelectric potential, but the location within the national park generated controversy. An act of Congress was required to circumvent federal protection of the Tuolumne River, with the reasoning that public land should be developed for the <b>public</b> <b>benefit.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that a person lacks standing, there is a {{possibility}} that he or she may be able to ask the Attorney-General to allow him or her to bring a relator action. In this scenario, the Attorney-General would be the nominal plaintiff in the judicial review proceedings, but the case would actually be conducted by the individual. Bringing a relator action is one means of circumventing the requirement of standing on the part of the individual applicant, because the Attorney-General has an interest in upholding the law for the <b>public</b> <b>benefit.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Albany Port District Commission is a <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> {{corporation}} {{created by}} the state of New York to develop and manage port facilities anywhere in the cities of Albany and Rensselaer. The commission has five members, four of which are nominated by the mayor of Albany and one is nominated by the mayor of Rensselaer. The governor of New York then appoints them to three-year terms. The commissioners serve without pay, but are compensated for business related expenses. The commission {{is considered to be a}} unit of the city of Albany and is included in the city's financial statements. Any deficit in the finances of the commission are assessed against both Albany and Rensselaer. In 1932 the state decided that any deficit assessment would be based on Albany owing 88% of the total and Rensselaer 12%. In 2005 the commission had a staff of 35 employees: eight in administrative duties, five in maintenance, and 22 as part-time security.|$|E

40|$|Background: Regional Cardiocerebrovascular Centers (RCC) were {{established}} for the prevention and treatment of cardiocerebrovas-cular disease and funded by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop and validate the measure-ment tool of <b>public</b> <b>benefits</b> in RCC. Methods: Through the intensive literature review, experts surveys and their repetitive feedback, we selected the 46 items about the <b>public</b> <b>benefits</b> in RCC. Development of measurement tool involved content validity test using Content Validity Index (CVI), construct validity test through factor analysis and reliability test. Results: Thirty-five items were selected by content validity test, which CVI was 0. 08 or higher. Through the construct validity test, 32 items in 7 factors were derived. And Cronbach’s alpha was 0. 951. Finally, <b>public</b> <b>benefits</b> measurement tool is composed of 32 items in 7 factors which are comprehensiveness of health care services, market complement, emergency care, cost, governance, quality improvement, and government control.

25|$|<b>Public</b> <b>benefit</b> {{corporations}} in New York operate like quasi-private corporations, generally with boards appointed by elected officials. They are {{a form of}} government bureaucracy in one sense but, unlike government agencies, <b>public</b> <b>benefit</b> corporations are exempt from some regulations. Of particular importance, they can take out their own debt, allowing them to bypass legal limits on state debt. This allows them to make potentially risky capital and infrastructure investments without putting {{so much of the}} credit of New York on the line. However, it also allows them to avoid many of the oversight and reporting regulations that apply to state government.|$|E

This policy brief reviews research studies on undocumented immigration and <b>public</b> <b>benefits,</b> with specific attention to health insurance benefits. Because so few studies examine the migration of undocumented immigrants for health benefits, the authors also review two directly related areas of inquiry: 1) the relationship between <b>public</b> <b>benefits</b> offered by a state and the destination choice of legal immigrants to the United States; and 2) the migration of low-income citizens across state lines in response to <b>public</b> <b>benefits</b> offered by states...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural {{conservation}} easements (ACEs) {{involve the}} significant expenditure {{of public funds}} through either tax <b>benefits</b> and/or direct <b>public</b> expenditures. The selection of agricultural parcels for conservation should, therefore, maximise net <b>public</b> <b>benefits</b> {{to the extent possible}} within financial constraints and the need for agricultural viability to maintain working landscapes. Some programmes select agricultural parcels for conservation easements based only on agricultural viability and/or land cost, however, without explicit consideration of the many other <b>public</b> <b>benefits</b> often associated with ACEs. This paper illustrates application of a method for increasing the <b>public</b> <b>benefits</b> of agricultural conservation easements through a case study in the northern San Joaquin Valley of California. The method is a strategic planning process that incorporates both a GIS-based quantitative assessment and a more qualitative assessment. Such an approach is a supplement to - rather than a substitute for - the more science-based Landscape Evaluation and Site Evaluation (LESA) approach developed by the US Soil Conservation Service (SCS) and cost-minimisation approaches that emphasise economic considerations. However, we show that public land use planning and regulatory policies are essential for agricultural conservation. Acquisition strategies in isolation will not be successful without complementary public regulatory policies. agricultural conservation easements, <b>public</b> <b>benefits,</b> strategic acquisitions, planning process, regulatory policy,...|$|R
