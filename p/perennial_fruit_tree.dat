The present study aimed at combining a FSPM built for apple tree, MAppleT, with genetic determinisms of architectural traits, previously described in a bi-parental population.

Two independent datasets collected in 2004 and 2007 on 116 genotypes, issued from a ‘Starkrimson’ × ‘Granny Smith’ cross, were used. The phyllochron was estimated as a function of thermal time and sylleptic branching was modeled subsequently depending on phyllochron. From a genetic map built with SNPs, marker effects were estimated on four MAppleT parameters with rrBLUP, using 2007 data. These effects were then considered in MAppleT to simulate tree development in the two climatic conditions. The genome wide prediction model gave consistent estimations of parameter values with correlation coefficients between observed values and estimated values from SNP markers ranging from 0. 79 to 0. 96.

40|$|International audienceThe {{vegetative}} {{development of}} plants {{results from the}} rate of leaf emergence (RLE), internode elongation and branching. Assuming that these processes are under genetic control and affected by environmental conditions such as temperature and soil water content, this study aimed at modelling them {{in the case of}} 1 year old apple tree. Previous studies have suggested that RLE modulates sylleptic branching since the number of sylleptic branches is often higher when the RLE is high during the season. We thus proposed to model the influence of RLE on sylleptic branching assuming that the plasticity of sylleptic branching results from that in RLE. These three processes, i. e. RLE, sylleptic branching and internode elongation are included in MAppleT, a functional-structural plant model (FPSM) for apple tree, to simulate its development. Experimental data were collected on one year-old trees corresponding to a progeny issued from 'Starkrimson' × 'Granny Smith' cross (116 genotypes), with four replicates per genotype submitted to water stress or optimal irrigation. The number of newly emitted metamers was counted every week whereas the mean length of internodes and the number and position of sylleptic axes were assessed {{at the end of the}} growth season. Temperature and soil water potential (SWP) were measured over the experiment. The RLE was modelled using a thermal-time based approach in degree days (dd). The probability of emergence of a sylleptic lateral (Psyll) was estimated as a linear function of RLEdd, for each well-watered tree. Then, the markers effects on phenotypic values for RLEdd, and its interaction with SWP, Psyll and the mean internode length, in either well-watered or water stress conditions, were estimated using a ridge regression (RR) for 106 out of the 116 genotypes. The accuracy of genomic predictions obtained by these RR was estimated using a 5 -fold cross-validation and ranged from 0. 24 to 0. 37. The last step of our approach will consist in considering the matrix of marker effects as an input of MAppleT to simulate the integrated phenotypes resulting from the three studied traits for the 10 genotypes not included in the RR, with or without water stress effect. Simulations will then be compared to the observed phenotypes to validate the overall approach. This study is a first attempt to integrate genome-wide information in a functional-structural plant model for a <b>perennial</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> taking into account environmental effects.

It is a hardy crop and is cultivated successfully even in neglected soils and is attacked by {{a large number of}} pathogens, mainly fungi. Wilt is the most destructive disease for guava plant in India and losses due to this disease are substantial. Psidium guajava wilt is known to occur from India, Latin America, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Africa, South Asia and Taiwan. Wilt of guava from India was first reported in 1935 from Allahabad. The disease is soil-borne and is difficult to control. Wilt is predominantly caused by the species of Fusarium, of which F. oxysporum is generally the main cause. The other species of Fusarium i. e., Fusarium solani are also dominates in isolation. Since, the disease results in the complete mortality of the affected plants, the loss is total.

This biennial cycle of fruiting, termed alternate bearing, was described 170 years ago in apple (Malus domestica). Apple inflorescences are mainly found on short branches (spurs). Bourse shoots (BS) develop from the leaf axils of the spur. BS apices may terminate ~ 100 days after flowering, with formation of next year's inflorescences. We sought to determine how developing fruit on the spur prevent the adjacent BS apex from forming an inflorescence. The presence of adjacent fruit correlated with reaccumulation of transcript encoding a potential flowering inhibitor, MdTFL 1 - 2, in BS apices prior to inflorescence initiation. BS apices without adjacent fruit that did not flower due to late fruitlet removal, neighboring <b>fruit</b> on the <b>tree,</b> or leaf removal, also reaccumulated MdTFL 1 - 2 transcript. Fruit load and gibberellin (GA) application had similar effects on the expression of MdTFL 1 - 2 and genes involved in GA biosynthesis and metabolism. Some apple cultivars are less prone to alternate bearing. We show that the response of a BS apex to different numbers of adjacent fruit differs among cultivars in both MdTFL 1 - 2 accumulation and return flowering.

In <b>perennial</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> with long generation times and large sizes of adult plants, {{the impact of}} these techniques is even more important. High-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have provided complete annotated sequences in many important tree species. Most of the high-throughput genotyping platforms described are being used for studies of genetic diversity and population structure. Dissection of complex traits became possible through the availability of genome sequences along with phenotypic variation data, which allow to elucidate the causative genetic differences that give rise to observed phenotypic variation. Association mapping facilitates the association between genetic markers and phenotype in unstructured and complex populations, identifying molecular markers for assisted selection and breeding. Also, genomic data provide in silico identification and characterization of genes and gene families related to important traits, enabling new tools for molecular marker assisted selection in tree breeding. Deep sequencing of transcriptomes is also a powerful tool for the analysis of precise expression levels of each gene in a sample. It consists in quantifying short cDNA reads, obtained by NGS technologies, in order to compare the entire transcriptomes between genotypes and environmental conditions. The miRNAs are non-coding short RNAs involved in the regulation of different physiological processes, which can be identified by high-throughput sequencing of RNA libraries obtained by reverse transcription of purified short RNAs, and by in silico comparison with known miRNAs from other species. All together, NGS techniques and their applications have increased the resources for plant breeding in tree species, closing the former gap of genetic tools between trees and annual species...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Unlike in tomato, {{little is}} known about the genetic and {{molecular}} control of fleshy <b>fruit</b> development of <b>perennial</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> like grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.). Here we present the study of the sequence polymorphism in a 1 Mb grapevine genome region at the top of chromosome 18 carrying the fleshless berry mutation (flb) in order, first to identify SNP markers closely linked to the gene and second to search for possible signatures of domestication. Results In total, 62 regions (17 SSR, 3 SNP, 1 CAPS and 41 re-sequenced gene fragments) were scanned for polymorphism along a 3. 4 Mb interval (85, 127 - 3, 506, 060 bp) at the top of the chromosome 18, in both V. vinifera cv. Chardonnay and a genotype carrying the flb mutation, V. vinifera cv. Ugni Blanc mutant. A nearly complete homozygosity in Ugni Blanc (wild and mutant forms) and an expected high level of heterozygosity in Chardonnay were revealed. Experiments using qPCR and BAC FISH confirmed the observed homozygosity. Under the assumption that flb could be one of the genes involved into the domestication syndrome of grapevine, we sequenced 69 gene fragments, spread over the flb region, representing 48, 874 bp in a highly diverse set of cultivated and wild V. vinifera genotypes, to identify possible signatures of domestication in the cultivated V. vinifera compartment. We identified eight gene fragments presenting a significant deviation from neutrality of the Tajima's D parameter in the cultivated pool. One of these also showed higher nucleotide diversity in the wild compartments than in the cultivated compartments. In addition, SNPs significantly associated to berry weight variation were identified in the flb region. Conclusions We observed the occurrence of a large homozygous region in a non-repetitive region of the grapevine otherwise highly-heterozygous genome and propose a hypothesis for its formation. We demonstrated the feasibility to apply BAC FISH on the very small grapevine chromosomes and provided a specific probe for the identification of chromosome 18 on a cytogenetic map. We evidenced genes showing putative signatures of selection and SNPs significantly associated with berry weight variation in the flb region. In addition, we provided to the community 554 SNPs at the top of chromosome 18 for the development of a genotyping chip for future fine mapping of the flb gene in a F 2 population when available. </p...|$|R

However, their effects on <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> yield have not received wide attention and few existing works considering plant-aphid interaction and its consequences have only been conducted over a single year.

The new model indicates that fertilization affects plant growth more than aphid infestation and the consequences of aphid infestation over fruit yield only emerge when considering the entire tree life span (ca. 10 yr). In fact, in a given year, aphid infestation mainly impairs shoot growth and, as fruits are borne on 1 -yr old wood, its effects on fruit production are delayed in time.

40|$|Abstract Background Blighia sapida is a woody <b>perennial</b> {{multipurpose}} <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> species {{native to}} the Guinean forests of West Africa. The fleshy arils of the ripened fruits are edible. Seeds and capsules of the fruits are used for soap-making and {{all parts of the}} tree have medicinal properties. Although so far overlooked by researchers in the region, the tree is highly valued by farmers and is an important component of traditional agroforestry systems in Benin. Fresh arils, dried arils and soap are traded in local and regional markets in Benin providing substantial revenues for farmers, especially women. Recently, ackee has emerged as high-priority species for domestication in Benin but information necessary to elaborate a clear domestication strategy is still very sketchy. This study addresses farmers' indigenous knowledge on uses, management and perception of variation of the species among different ethnic groups taking into account also gender differences. Methods 240 randomly selected persons (50 % women) belonging to five different ethnic groups, 5 women active in the processing of ackee fruits and 6 traditional healers were surveyed with semi-structured interviews. Information collected refer mainly to the motivation of the respondents to conserve ackee trees in their land, the local uses, the perception of variation, the preference in fruits traits, the management practices to improve the production and regenerate ackee. Results People have different interests on using ackee, variable knowledge on uses and management practices, and have reported nine differentiation criteria mainly related to the fruits. Ackee phenotypes with preferred fruit traits are perceived by local people to be more abundant in managed in-situ and cultivated stands than in unmanaged wild stands, suggesting that traditional management has initiated a domestication process. As many as 22 diseases have been reported to be healed with ackee. In general, indigenous knowledge about ackee varies among ethnic and gender groups. Conclusions With the variation observed among ethnic groups and gender groups for indigenous knowledge and preference in fruits traits, a multiple breeding sampling strategy is recommended during germplasm collection and multiplication. This approach will promote sustainable use and conservation of ackee genetic resources. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} for acceptance of <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> in farmland was determined in four selected villages in Morogoro region. Farmers realizing {{the level of}} farmland degradation were highly motivated to adopt the innovation for incorporation of adapted <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> species in their farms and household premises. In order to fast track <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> planting activities {{for the purpose of}} reducing the impact of climate change in local farming communities, at total 2, 600 of different grafted/budded (1, 400) and non grafted seedlings from <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> species adapted to these areas were distributed and planted to three villages; Msingisi, Masenge (Gairo) and Mlimani ward (Morogoro). Most of transplanted <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> (72. 6 %) survived. Furthermore, for intensified and sustainable planting of <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> in the target and nearby villages, one nursery site was established and 50 farmers were trained in plant propagation and nursery establishment. A total of 1, 200 Avocado rootstocks were raised and more than 80 % (900 seedlings) of them have been successfully grafted. The use of <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> species as a strategic intervention for mitigation and adaptation to climate change in the study areas has been received positively with increasing demand for more <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> per village.

40|$|Well {{in advance}} of the {{hurricane}} season an assessment of the location and size of the <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> in the home land-scape should be made. Ideally, <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> with a potential to become large (e. g., avocado and mango) and not regularly pruned should be planted 25 ft or more away from the home, other structures (e. g., garage and tool shed), power lines, and other trees. If, however, a large <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> is already in-place, a certified arborist should be contacted to reduce tree height and properly prune the tree to open the canopy to wind movement. Alternatively, large, potentially hazardous <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> may be transferred to a new location or removed completely and a new <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> established at a greater distance from the home, structure, or power lines. Before work begins, check with local county agencies on regulations for pruning and/or removing <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> fro...|$|R

The City of Calgary, for instance, launched their Community Orchard Pilot project in 2009. Some of the orchards are city run {{and others are}} community-run. Their goal was to encourage local food production, foster community involvement, educate Calgarians about <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> care techniques, to demonstrate and test a range of <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> and shrubs and to evaluate the success of community orchard models, share results and recommend changes if required.|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{breeding}} of temperate <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> is constrained by their extensive reproductive cycle with long juvenile periods, complex reproductive biology, and {{high degree of}} heterozygosity. As the commercial production of transgenic annual crops becomes a reality {{in many parts of}} the world, the question remains whether genetically engineering <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> will find commercial application. Gene transfer for <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> improvement has several inherent advantages. Once a useful transformant is isolated, vegetative propagation, which is the normal method of multiplying <b>fruit</b> <b>trees,</b> provides unlimited production of the desired transgenic line. Fixation through the sexual cycle is unnecessary and inconvenient if commercially-accepted cultivars are transformed. Since production of most <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> species is based on a few cultivars, the impact of transforming one of them would be significant. Currently, however, the only transgenic <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> commercially produced is papaya (Carica papaya L.) resistant to PRSV (papaya ringspot virus). (Further information on commercialized transgenic crops can be found a...|$|R

40|$|The genetic {{improvement}} of tropical <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> is limited {{when compared to}} progress achieved in temperate <b>fruit</b> <b>trees</b> and annual crops. Tropical <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> breeding programs require significant resources to develop new cultivars that are adapted to modern shipping and storage requirements. The use of molecular markers in tropical <b>fruit</b> <b>tree</b> breeding is greatly assisting in solving a number of difficult challenges for breeders such as the development of complex family structures for recombination mapping and for recurrent selection.
