2500|$|The {{concept of}} the item {{response}} function was around before 1950. [...] The pioneering work of IRT as a theory occurred during the 1950s and 1960s. [...] Three of the pioneers were the Educational Testing Service <b>psychometrician</b> Frederic M. Lord, the Danish mathematician Georg Rasch, and Austrian sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld, who pursued parallel research independently. [...] Key figures who furthered the progress of IRT include Benjamin Drake Wright and David Andrich. IRT did not become widely used until the late 1970s and 1980s, when practitioners were told the [...] "usefulness" [...] and [...] "advantages" [...] of IRT on the one hand, and personal computers gave many researchers access to the computing power necessary for IRT on the other.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>psychometrician</b> L. L. Thurstone, {{founder and}} first {{president}} of the Psychometric Society in 1936, developed and applied a theoretical approach to measurement referred to as the law of comparative judgment, an approach that has close connections to the psychophysical theory of Ernst Heinrich Weber and Gustav Fechner. In addition, Spearman and Thurstone both made important contributions to the theory and application of factor analysis, a statistical method developed and used extensively in psychometrics. In the late 1950s, Leopold Szondi made an historical and epistemological assessment of the impact of statistical thinking onto psychology during previous few decades: [...] "in the last decades, the specifically psychological thinking has been almost completely suppressed and removed, and replaced by a statistical thinking. Precisely here we see the cancer of testology and testomania of today." ...|$|E

40|$|My aim in {{this chapter}} is to outline some of the {{substantive}} and psychometric bases on which we can build a science of assessment that {{takes advantage of the}} enormous potential inherent in the digital computer and in artificial intelligence. Some of these foundations are within the traditions of classical assessment. But others represent urgently needed areas of explication and research. It is my view, in the tradition of Cronbach (1954), that developers of computer software for testing should listen to what <b>psychometricians</b> say, and, as well, <b>psychometricians</b> should be sensitive to new research ideas waiting to be solved that arise out of the experience of preparing software for test interpretation. This is particularly true because some of classical test theory based on fixed sets of items is rendered obsolete by the prospect of adaptive testing. The fact that <b>psychometricians</b> and authors of interpretive software are rarely prone to listen to one another brings to mind a quotation from the world-weary French novelist and philosopher, Andre Gide, cited by Block (1978) : "It has all been said before, bu...|$|R
25|$|Spearman's {{argument}} {{proposing a}} general factor of human intelligence is still accepted in principle by many <b>psychometricians.</b> Today's factor models of intelligence typically represent cognitive abilities as a three-level hierarchy, {{where there are}} {{a large number of}} narrow factors {{at the bottom of the}} hierarchy, a handful of broad, more general factors at the intermediate level, and at the apex a single factor, referred to as the g factor, which represents the variance common to all cognitive tasks. However, this view is not universally accepted; other factor analyses of the data, with different results, are possible. Some <b>psychometricians</b> regard g as a statistical artifact.|$|R
25|$|Many <b>psychometricians</b> {{are also}} {{concerned}} with finding and eliminating test bias from their psychological tests. Test bias {{is a form}} of systematic (i.e., non-random) error which leads to examinees from one demographic group having an unwarranted advantage over examinees from another demographic group. According to leading experts, test bias may cause differences in average scores across demographic groups, but differences in group scores are not sufficient evidence that test bias is actually present because the test could be measuring real differences among groups. <b>Psychometricians</b> use sophisticated scientific methods to search for test bias and eliminate it. Research shows that it is usually impossible for people reading a test item to accurately determine whether it is biased or not.|$|R

The period 1895 – 1925 saw the origins and establishment of the fields that came to be called econometrics and psychometrics. I consider what these fields owed to biometry—the statistical approach to the biological problems of evolution—and make some comparisons between all three. I emphasize developments in biology and psychology, for these are less familiar to historians of econometrics. These developments are interesting to contemplate, for the biometricians and <b>psychometricians</b> were already discussing issues associated with the respective roles of statistical analysis and of subject matter theory, issues that became prominent in econometrics only much later.

5000|$|Because of the sophistication, the {{development}} of a CAT has a number of prerequisites.

[...] The development of the Rasch model, and the broader class of models to which it belongs, was explicitly founded on requirements of measurement in the physical sciences.|$|R
