Ao mesmo tempo, apesar de ser uma indústria de baixa densidade tecnológica, destaca-se como uma indústria de elevada interatividade com a infraestrutura científica e tecnológica, segundo dados do Diretório dos Grupos de Pesquisa do CNPq. Segundo os dados da PINTEC, no entanto, a IMB é uma das indústrias de mais baixa inovatividade da economia nacional, o que é incompatível com o seu desempenho econômico e competitividade internacional. Tendo em vista estas considerações, o presente trabalho tem como tema a conduta inovativa da IMB e foi norteado por três problemas interdependentes de pesquisa, quais sejam, {{investigar}} as motivações para a elevada interatividade desta indústria com a infraestrutura científica e tecnológica, avaliar as razões pelas quais as suas elevadas interatividade e competitividade não resultam em um perfil inovativo positivamente diferenciado na PINTEC e, finalmente, identificar as demandas e características dos seus relacionamentos com pesquisadores da área de Engenharia Metalúrgica e de Materiais. Para tanto, foram utilizados os referenciais teóricos da Escola Evolucionária Neo-Schumpeteriana e as metodologias de análise de cluster, análise comparada e entrevistas estruturadas. Os resultados mostram uma indústria de elevado esforço inovativo, alto desempenho inovador e elemento central de um Sistema Setorial de Inovação longevo, atuante e robusto. Adicionalmente, foi identificada a inadequação da definição do perfil setorial a partir do número de empresas em atuação pois, em um setor em que é grande o número de empresas, mas é elevada a concentração econômica, o conjunto de empresas que define o perfil setorial é restrito e é este que deve ser considerado na avaliação do comportamento setorial. A conduta inovativa da IMB, bem como as idiossincrasias das indústrias de baixa densidade tecnológica e elevada concentração econômica sugerem a necessidade de, dada a relevância econômica destes setores, aprofundar os estudos e definir políticas públicasespecíficas para essas indústriasAbstract: The Brazilian Basic Metals Industry - BMI (Production of <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>ferro-alloy,</b> Stell, Production {{of steel}} tubes except seamless tubes, Non-ferrous Metallurgy and Foundry) is internationally competitive {{and is the}} second largest exporter of the industry of national transformation. At the same time, despite being a low-density technology industry stands out as an industry of high interactivity with the scientific and technological infrastructure according to the CNPq Directory of Research Group. According to the PINTEC data, however, IBM {{is one of the}} lowest innovativeness industry of the national economy, which is incompatible with its economic performance and international competitiveness. With these considerations, this work has as its theme the IBM innovative conduct and it was guided by three interrelated research problems, which are to investigate the reasons for the high interactivity of this industry with the scientific and technological infrastructure, to assess the reasons why their high interactivity and competitiveness do not result in a positively different innovative profile in PINTEC and finally, to identify the demands and characteristics of their relationships with researchers from the Metallurgy and Materials Engineering area. For this, it was used the theoretical references from the Neo-Schumpeterian Evolutionary School and the methodologies for cluster analysis, comparative analysis and structured interviews. The results show a high innovative effort industry, high performance and central element of a long-life, active and robust Sector Innovation System. In addition, it was identified the inadequacy of the definition of the sector profile from the number of companies in operation because, in a sector where the number of companies is large but the economic concentration is high, the group of companies that define the sector profile is limited and {{this is the one that}} must be considered in assessing the sector behavior. The innovative conduct of IBM as well as the idiosyncrasies of low technological density and high economic concentration industries suggest the need, given the economic importance of these sectors, for further studies and define specific public policies for these industrie...|$|R

40|$|The {{interfacial}} phenomena between molten <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> ilmenite prereduced {{with carbon}} and hydrogen were investigated. The wettability of prereduced ilmenite discs by molten <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> was evaluated through measuring contact angle by the sessile droplet method. The effects of melting temperature, prereduction temperature and reduction degree on contact angle were examined. Molten <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> {{could not be}} wetted by ilmenite prereduced with carbon and hydrogen, and the contact angle increases with increasing prereduction temperature. The contact angles of ilmenite prereduced with hydrogen are {{higher than that of}} ilmenite prereduced with carbon at the same reduction degree. The permeation of molten <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> into porous ilmenite was observed at the interface of specimens prereduced with carbon and enhanced at higher reduction temperature. On the other hand, in the case of ilmenite prereduced with hydrogen, the permeation was not observed.
