40|$|The {{efficiency}} of beef cattle breeding {{is limited by}} the productive performance of animals, by the systems of fattening and purchasing and by the <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> of the produce. In order to establish the relationship among these, 87 bullocks have been studied. The animals belong to two productive types – beef and dairy breeds. They have been fattened under two systems – in barns and combined (including pasture period and subsequent fattening in a barn). The effect of the studied factors was shown using various linear models. Fattening system and age have had a reliable influence on the <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> per kg of yield and kg of live weight with all breeds. The combined fattening and the younger age are prerequisites for lower <b>prime</b> <b>cost.</b> Various breed groups, and not the fattening systems, have influenced the slaughter yield. The lower <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> per kg of yield does not guarantee the lower <b>prime</b> <b>cost</b> per kg of live weight.

50|$|The {{preferred}} {{treatment of}} overhead costs {{was to bring}} them into contact with <b>prime</b> <b>costs</b> {{only at the end}} of an accounting period. Lewis proposed, that accounts containing overhead items be closed to profit and loss like ordinary expenses. At the same time, work in process and finished goods would be debited with their respective shares of overhead cost, and a suspense account in the general ledger would be credited. At the start of the next period a reversing entry was to be made, debiting suspense and crediting profit and loss. Then suspense was again debited and finished goods and work in process were credited, bringing the inventory accounts back to a prime cost basis and leaving total overhead cost as a balance in suspense.|$|E

40|$|Qualified {{management}} {{aimed at}} optimizing financial results {{is the key}} factor in today's society. Effective management decisions depend on the necessary information about the costs of production process in all its aspects – their structure, types, accounting policies of reflecting costs. General production costs, the so-called indirect costs that are {{not directly related to}} the production process, but provide its functioning in terms of supporting structural divisions and create the necessary conditions of production, {{play a significant role in}} calculating <b>prime</b> <b>costs</b> of goods (works, services). However, the accurate estimate of <b>prime</b> <b>costs</b> of goods (works, services) should be determined with the value of indirect costs (in other words, general production costs), and properly determined with the base of their allocation. The choice of allocation base of general production costs is the significant moment, depending on the nature of business, which must guarantee fair distribution regarding to the largest share of direct expenses in the total structure of production costs. The study finds the essence of general production costs based on the analysis of key definitions of leading Ukrainian economists. The optimal allocation approach of general production costs is to calculate these costs as direct production costs within each subsidiary division (department) separately without selecting a base as the main one to the their total amount. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore cost and {{management}} accounting practices utilized by manufacturing companies operating in Istanbul, Turkey. The sample of the study consists of 61 companies, containing both small and medium-sized enterprises, and large companies. The data collection methodology of the study is questionnaire survey. The content of the questionnaire survey is based on several previous studies. The major findings of the study are as follows: the most widely used product costing method is job costing; the complexity in production poses as the highest ranking difficulty in product costing; the most widely used three overhead allocation bases are <b>prime</b> <b>costs,</b> units produced, and direct labor cost; pricing decisions is the most important area where costing information is used; overall mean of the ratio of overhead to total cost is 34. 48 percent for all industries; and the most important three management accounting practices are budgeting, planning and control, and cost-volume-profit analysis. Furthermore, decreasing profitability, increasing costs and competition, and economic crises are the factors, which increase the perceived importance of cost accounting. The findings indicate that companies perceive traditional management accounting tools still important. However, new management accounting practices such as strategic planning, and transfer pricing are perceived less important than traditional ones.

40|$|A {{development}} of productional services for agriculture {{is one of}} the essential factors effecting the progress in production, effectiveness and <b>prime</b> <b>costs.</b> This fact can justify advisability of the undertaken research in tendencies and directions of changes in the structures related to the productional services in agriculture. The article presents the analysis of a course of changes in the services structure in the cross-sections: sector, objective and subjective. The period of 1975 - 1983 was examined. The analysis was performed by the own method of measuring the structure dynamics. The study proves that the share of unsocialized sector in a general value of sold services constantly increases. Thus a process of nullifying differences in a dissémination of productional services between socialized and unsocialized farms is developing This tendency has to be estimated in a positive way. The most radical changes in all the structures are observed in the years 1981 - 1982, i. e. the period of substantial socio-economic changes. Among the negative tendencies one has to note a systematic decrease in the share of transport services. This tendency can be observed in both sectors. The further changes of structure of productional services in those directions which will be found favorable is related to a wide diffusion of a technological progress to the sphere of the discussed services. It calls for radical changes in the domain of allocation of funds engaged in the food economy for the sake of agricultural services, especially the specialized ones. These changes must account for the economic specificity in the particular sectors.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Emerald Group Publishing via [URL] – This paper seeks {{to contribute to the}} literature on demand-driven Keynesian growth in open economies by developing a formal model that combines Dixon and Thirlwall’s (1975) export-led growth model and Thirlwall’s (1979) balance-of-payments constrained growth models into a more general specification. Then, based on the model developed in this paper, we analyse more broadly some important issues concerning the net impact of currency depreciation on the short-run growth. Design/methodology/approach – We build upon Dixon and Thirlwall’s (1975) export-led growth model and Thirlwall’s (1979) balance-of-payments constrained growth models in order to develop our theoretical framework. We also run numerical simulations to illustrate the net impact of devaluation on the short-run growth rate in different scenarios. Findings – We demonstrate that the net impact of currency devaluation on growth can go either way, depending on some structural conditions such as the average share of imported intermediate inputs in <b>prime</b> <b>costs</b> of domestic firms and the institutional capacity of trade unions to set nominal wages through the bargaining process. The model also shows that the effectiveness of a competitive real exchange rate to promote growth is higher in countries where the share of labour in domestic income is also higher. Research limitations/implications – This paper provides a coherent formal starting-point for further theoretical developments on the interrelatedness between currency devaluation, income distribution and growth. These findings provide empirically testable hypothesis for future research. Originality/value – The present study proposes an alternative formal solution for the theoretical problem of imposing a balance-of-payments constraint on the process of cumulative causation often incorporated in Kaldorian growth models. In terms of policy, our framework sheds further light on the relevance of income distribution and the labour market institutional framework for the dynamics of the exchange rate pass-through mechanism and allows us to map out related conditions under which currency devaluation can promote growth.
