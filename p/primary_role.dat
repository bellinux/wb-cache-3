5|$|Elk {{handling}} facilities are areas of pens with {{loading and unloading}} ramps where water and food are provided to the elk. They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk {{from the town of}} Banff. These measures allowed more predator–prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the <b>primary</b> <b>role</b> of wolves in elk population management.|$|E

5|$|Although the <b>primary</b> <b>role</b> of the British Army was {{to protect}} the colonies against {{external}} attack, no actual threat ever materialised.

The XXBomber Command reported to the USAAF's Twentieth Air Force, which was personally directed from Washington, D.C., by {{the commander of the}} USAAF General Henry H.

The global role ordering consists of the sequence of <b>primary</b> <b>roles</b> only, thus making it a partial ordering. ...|$|R

Also, a detachment of the unit providing the Queen's Guard at Buckingham Palace still mounts a guard at the Tower, and with the Yeomen Warders, takes part in the Ceremony of the Keys each day.

5|$|Like the {{preceding}} Siegfried-class ships, Odin and Ägir were obsolete {{by the time}} World War I had started. Regardless, they were still used in their <b>primary</b> <b>role</b> until 1915, at which point they were withdrawn from active service. The ships performed a variety of secondary duties {{until the end of}} the war. On 17 June 1919, both ships were struck from the naval register and sold to the A. Bernstein Company in Hamburg. The shipping company had the ships rebuilt as freighters; Odin served in this capacity until she was scrapped in 1935, however Ägir accidentally grounded near the Karlsö lighthouse on the island of Gotland in 1929 and proved to be a total loss.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{studies for}} large destroyers capable of {{defending}} the French battleline against attacks by enemy destroyers and torpedo boats by the Naval General Staff (NGS) began before World War I, but were suspended {{when the war}} began. They resumed in 1917, but serious planning did not begin until after the war when the NGS decided to split {{the role of the}} destroyer in 1919. The smaller torpilleur d'escadre would have the role of attacking the enemy's battleline with torpedoes and defending that of the French from enemy torpedo craft. The <b>primary</b> <b>role</b> of the larger contre-torpilleur was scouting; defending the battleline was secondary and attacking the enemy battleline least important. This required high speed in all weather, good endurance and a powerful armament capable of engaging small cruisers.|$|E
