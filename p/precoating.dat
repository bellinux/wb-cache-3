40|$|Filter {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to determine the most suitable filter for removing large quantities of aluminum corrosion product (boehmite) from reactor water. Filters tested included the following: wire-wound, sintered filter elements, sintered ceramic fllter elements, cotton stringwound filter elements, felted-cotton filter elements, cation resin, adsorption resin, diatomaceous earth <b>precoat</b> filter, and a wood-cellulose <b>precoat</b> filter. Parameters measured were flow rate, filter-influent and -effluent boehmite concentration, pressure drop, and final filter load. The pressure drop and efficiency of the filters was correlated with boehmite load. Boehmite deposits on filters as a nonporous gelatinous cake, and causes a rapidly increasing pressure drop. Tests indicate that the optimum load with filter elements and <b>precoat</b> filters is achieved at a pressure drop of 25 psi. Very little additional load {{can be obtained by}} operating to a higher pressure drop. Of the filters tested, the <b>precoat</b> filter snd 40 to 60 mesh cation resin were the more effective in removing boehmite. The efficiency of the <b>precoat</b> filter was in excess of 99 %, and the efficiency of the cation resin was for the most part in excess of 95 %. For various reasons, the other filters were eliminated from final consideration. The test program and available literature indicated that an element type <b>precoat</b> filter using wood cellulose as the <b>precoat</b> media would be most suitable for the proposed application.

40|$|Bonding of <b>precoated</b> bracket on a {{composite}} restoration needs adhesion between two exisiting polimerized materials. Composite restorations are usually polished by using rubber cups before bonding. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the influence of {{a composite}} resin surface polishing on the adhesion to <b>precoated</b> brackets. Specimens of Filtek Z 250 and enamel were polished with rubber cups according to different protocols; <b>precoated</b> brackets were bonded with Transbond XT to the specimens. The shear bond strength of brackets was evaluated and measured data were statistically analysed. The results highlight low adhesion forces between composite resin and brackets used, demonstrating an unsatisfactory bonding from a clinical point of view.

However the concentration was lower than 1 mol/L and the time was about 30 s in the ultrasonic environment. The <b>precoating</b> technology sequentially was studied. The results revealed that there were two main reactions of the corrosion and displacement in the <b>precoating</b> process, and these two reactions were more obvious in the grain boundary. The electrochemical analysis illustrated that the corrosion and displacement reactions were affected obviously by the current density and the <b>precoating</b> solution temperature, usually the current density was controlled about 0. 3 A/dm(2), and the temperature was about 318 K in the <b>precoating</b> process...|$|E
40|$|Release liners {{are used}} in various {{self-adhesive}} applications such as hygiene products (feminine care and diapers), envelopes, labels, etc. The main function of the release liner {{is to protect the}} adhesive layer in the product. Release liner has to stick to the adhesive, but also be easily removed from it. Therefore, the optimal level of release force needed to peel off the release liner is important for the proper performance of the liner. Release liner consists usually of base paper, <b>precoating,</b> and silicone coating. Silicone offers easy release, but it is the most expensive part of the release liner. <b>Precoating</b> makes the paper surface smoother and allows the use of a thinner silicone layer. The properties of the base paper, such as roughness and porosity, as well as the properties of the <b>precoating</b> and silicone coating, such as coating coverage, affect the final performance of the release liner. In addition to the factors directly related to the release liner, the release performance is affected by other factors such as the adhesive, the face stock material and the peel speed and angle. For a release liner manufacturer, {{it is important to know}} well all the factors that affect the performance of the release liner in the final product. In this work, influence of base paper porosity, <b>precoating</b> and silicone amount of the release liner as well as impact of different adhesives on the release force were investigated. In the theoretical part of the work, the phenomenon of adhesion is introduced with the help of general adhesion theories, continued with the concept of practical adhesion, or the practical strength of the adhesive bond, with contributions of fundamental adhesion and energy dissipation in the peeling process. Then, the materials involved in the study are introduced starting from the base paper, <b>precoating</b> and silicone, and continuing with pressure-sensitive adhesives. For the experimental part of the work, release liner samples were prepared with a base paper of 3 different levels of porosity coated with a hand coater using 2 levels of <b>precoating</b> and 3 levels of silicone coating. Air permeance values (closely related to the porosity), coat weights, water contact angles, and surface roughness were determined for the release liner samples. Six commercial adhesives intended for release liner applications were then characterized by their rheological properties. Release tests were then performed for the 18 different release liner samples and 6 different adhesives. It was found that the porosity of the base paper at the porosity level used did not have strong influence, but paper with lower porosity would allow the use of lower level of <b>precoating.</b> The level of <b>precoating</b> and silicone coating expectedly had a significant influence on the release performance with a higher level of <b>precoating</b> allowing less silicone to be used. Unexpectedly, a clear correlation between the rheological properties of the adhesive and the release force was not found.

30|$|Since {{there were}} no {{significant}} differences in the bonding strength after 24  h, the immediate bonding strength of the <b>precoated</b> brackets during the first day does not appear to be a major advantage over the conventional bracket systems.

30|$|When extrapolating {{these results}} to a {{clinical}} setting, {{it can be}} concluded that better bonding strength may not be a major advantage of the <b>precoated</b> brackets over the conventional ones.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis was to gain a greater {{understanding}} of the interactions between the base paper and coating color in the metered size press (MSP) nip. The effect of base paper in <b>precoating</b> with an MSP was investigated using mill woodfree base papers, laboratory sheets, pilot base papers and non-porous materials. The coating color formulations consisted of commercial raw materials, in most cases latex-CMC colors with a pigment mixture of CaCO and kaolin. Coating studies were carried out at 1000 m/min with a pilot-scale MSP coater. The coating layer formation on woodfree base paper in MSP <b>precoating</b> depended mainly on the base paper surface openness. Lowering the base paper openness by raising the filler content, adding mechanical pulp or through more intensive refining of the chemical pulps resulted in lower coatweights, but better coating coverage. Base paper roughness, small-scale basis weight variation (beta formation) and surface chemical properties of the fibers (hydrophilic / hydrophobic) had no effect on <b>precoating</b> layer formation or coverage.

Platelet aggregates were observed on immunoglobulin G-coated polyethylene, whereas all other surfaces showed single adherent platelets.

40|$|Oral gavage is {{a common}} route of precise oral dosing for studies in rodents. Complications {{including}} tracheal administration, esophageal trauma, and aspiration are common and usually related to animal resistance to the procedure, and the stress induced by oral gavage can be a confounding variable in many studies. The taste of sucrose conveys a pacifying and analgesic effect in newborns, whereas sour solutions can induce the swallow reflex in humans that are dysphagic. We hypothesized that <b>precoating</b> a gavage needle with sucrose or citrate (or both) would pacify mice and induce them to swallow, reducing the stress and complications associated with the technique. To validate this hypothesis, we quantitated time to passage, stress-related behavioral reactions to the procedure, and plasma corticosterone levels in mice after <b>precoating</b> gavage needles with water, sucrose, citrate, sucrose and citrate, or sodium chloride prior to oral gavage. <b>Precoating</b> needles with sucrose reduced the time to passage, decreased observable stress-related reactions to the procedure, and maintained plasma corticosterone levels {{similar to those in}} ungavaged control mice. Coating needles with water, sucrose and citrate, or citrate had no beneficial effects on these parameters. Our findings describe a novel, validated technique that measurably decreases signs of stress and thereby improves animal welfare during oral gavage. Furthermore, the use of sucrose may be a valuable tool to refine other minor or nonsurgical procedures in the field of laboratory animal research...|$|E

40|$|This article {{reports on}} a novel two-step {{strategy}} for the coating of cardiovascular stents by strongly adhering biocompatible and biodegradable aliphatic polyesters. First, a <b>precoating</b> of poly(ethylacrylate) (PEA) was electrografted onto the metallic substrate by cathodic reduction of the parent monomer in dimethylformamide (DMF). The electrodeposition of PEA, in a good solvent of it, was confirmed by both Infra-red and Raman spectroscopies. The pendant ester groups of PEA were then chemically reduced into aluminum alkoxides, able to initiate the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of either D,L-lactide (LA) or epsilon-caprolactone (CL).

40|$|Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) {{has been}} {{successfully}} {{used in conjunction with}} membrane microfiltration (MF) to reduce taste, odour, colour and other concerns caused by organic material present in raw drinking water sources. PAC addition also significantly reduces the extent of fouling in membranes. And the operation of continuously dosed PAC before membrane filtration is widely applied in drinking water treatment while the operation of PAC precoated on the membrane is a new approach. This research, therefore, aims at evaluating the membrane fouling on these two different PAC operations. Water from the Schie canal in Delft was coagulated with Iron (?) Chloride and enhanced with PAC, then filtered through a ceramic membrane. The trans-membrane pressure was monitored during filtration. Samples of the raw water and the permeate water were collected and analysed for DOC and UV 254, while LC-OCD tests were carried out on the collected samples as well. In addition, the the backwash water and chemical cleaning solutions after soaking membrane were analysed. The PAC in the continuous dosing channel was dosed before flocculation and the membrane was frequently backwashed every 19 minutes for 1 minute. However, the PAC in the <b>precoating</b> channel was precoated on the membrane before the experiment and operated without frequent backwashes. The results show that the membrane fouling in the continuous channel was more severe than that in the <b>precoating</b> channel which was mainly concluded from the recovery of TMP. That is because the different PAC addition modes lead to a different cake structure on the membrane surface. The cake layer in the continuous channel was mostly non-backwashable while it was easy to be backwashed in <b>precoating</b> channel. Recovery in the <b>precoating</b> channel was quite good with a recovery of 99. 2 % while the continuous channel presented a normal recovery of 85. 5 %. The DOC and UV 254 removal for these two operations was similar. Also, the LC-OCD results of the backwash water and the chemical cleaning solution reveal that, if ignoring the cake fouling, the total fouling for the two operations were not too much different while big difference existed in compositions of NOM.
