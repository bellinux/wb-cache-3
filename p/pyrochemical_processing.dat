Most of the available thermodynamic data on the molten salt systems pertain to binary or ternary systems. When multiple fission product elements are present in the electrolyte, the reduction behavior of the actinides could be significantly altered because of possible under potential reduction of lanthanides and slower diffusion kinetics of actinides. This presentation reports the variations in melting point and electrochemical behavior of LiCl + KCl eutectic mixture containing multi-components of RECl 3 additions.

HfO 2 and Sm 2 O 3 were used as surrogates for PuO 2 and Am 2 O 3 respectively.

Part of this effort requires that the various manufacturing activities formerly performed at the Rocky Flats be reconstructed at LANL, modernized to improve operation, and re-certified for pit production. Part of this effort requires that new pyrochemical metal production facilities be installed in TA- 55 to replace existing outdated equipment. The purpose of this effort is design, build/procure, assemble, cold test, and support installation activities for ten <b>pyrochemical</b> <b>processing</b> gloveboxes and processing support equipment for insertion into a selected PF- 4 laboratory. Eight of the gloveboxes will be connected to a common trolley tunnel with a state-of-the-art automated transport system that can access each glovebox. Five of those gloveboxes will be designed to accommodate standard water-cooled <b>pyrochemical</b> <b>processing</b> furnaces with appropriate lift mechanisms for handling the furnace products and processing hardware. Another glovebox will be designed to accommodate an improved breaking press that will be designed/procured to break alpha metal up to a thickness of l-inch, eliminate introduction of hydraulic oil to the glovebox environment, provide appropriate shielding for prevention of glovebox damage due to shrapnel projectiles, and use interchangeable impact tools {{in order to be able}} to process both contaminated and clean metals with the same machine. In addition, a storage glovebox and a distillation glovebox (already developed) will be attached to the transport system. Two other gloveboxes, one accommodating two casting furnaces and another storage glovebox, will be installed in the laboratory independent of the transport system. A transfer system (trolley) will be incorporated to handle material flow between the pyrochemical furnace gloveboxes, the press glovebox, the storage glovebox, and the distillation glovebox. The trolley will be very simple to operate, able to accommodate at least 50 pounds, require minimal maintenance, and be able to be requested and operated fiom any of the glovebox locations on the line. The transfer system will be capable of discharging its load in some manner through the open door to the entrance of each of the gloveboxes on the line. This may be an automatic function with manual selection for unusual loads or a completely manual operation. An existing commercial or otherwise proven system will be used if possible to minimize the design and test time needed for the system. Two commercial systems examined so far are the Montrac monorail type system available from Montech Incorporated and the Linear Synchronous Motor system available from MagneMotion Inc. Work to be completed during FY 02 includes glovebox design, transport system industry research, demonstration of selected commercial transport systems, transport system conceptual design, metal breaking press conceptual design, and glovebox furnace lift mechanism design. Glovebox fabrication/procurement, material transport system procurement, press procurement, lift mechanism procurement, system assembly and staging, system testing, assistance in installing the system into TA- 55, assistance with NMT configuration management approvals, and shakeout testing of the system is scheduled for FY 03 and FY 04.

40|$|Treatment of spent {{nuclear fuel}} has {{received}} substantial attention over the last decade. At Idaho National Laboratory, pyrochemical separation is used to treat irradiated fuel elements from the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II). EBR-II, a sodium-cooled fast reactor at the Materials and Fuels Complex of the Idaho National Laboratory, was shutdown in late 1994 after 30 years of operation. It used uranium- 10 wt % zirconium metallic fuel alloy enriched to 67 - 78 % uranium- 235. Pyrochemical technology is applied to discharged spent fuel to separate uranium from other fuel components.

This paper reviews the options under consideration by the US Department of Energy and suggests an additional option that fits {{within the framework}} of the environmental analysis provided in the draft PEIS (Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement). In addition to the burning of Pu in mixed U-Pu oxide fuel, we recommend consideration of a non-fertile fuel based on zirconia with inclusion of rare earth elements for phase stabilization and control of reactivity. The zirconia based fuel could also be used to burn plutonium generated in commercial reactor fuels, which represent a larger inventory of plutonium than the weapon-grade material. The increasing inventories of civilian plutonium potentially represent a larger threat with respect to diversion weapons usable material than the stocks of weapon-grade material considered for disposition by the US and Russia. We discuss the use of zirconia-based fuel and <b>pyrochemical</b> <b>processing</b> of spent commercial reactor fuels as a means of decreasing world-wide plutonium inventories. The experience gained in burning weapon-grade plutonium in the new non-fertile fuel would shorten the time required to gain acceptance of the fuel for commercial reactor use...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pyrochemical</b> <b>processing</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the development of next generation nuclear reactors and closed nuclear fuel cycle technology. The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has implemented a pyrochemical process for the treatment of sodium-bonded spent fuel from the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II). A successful demonstration of the technology was performed from 1996 to 1999 for the Department of Energy (DOE) [1]. Processing of the spent fuel and associated research and development activities have been integrated into DOE’s Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiatives (AFCI) program since 2003. Electrorefining can be considered to be the signature or central technology for <b>pyrochemical</b> <b>processing.</b> In order to assess the efficiencies involved in the electrorefining process, an integrated electrorefining efficiency test was performed in the Mk-IV electrorefiner. This paper summarizes the observations and results obtained from the test. EXPERIMENT AND RESULTS The primary goal of the integrated processing efficiency test is to demonstrate the integrated actinide dissolution and recovery efficiencies typical for the fixed operating parameters that have been applied to Mk-IV electrorefiner (ER) and cathode processor (CP) to treat spent EBR-II driver fuel during the last three years. The findings are of importance for scaling-up the pyroprocess to recover and recycle valuable actinides from spent nuclear fuel. The test was performed in the Mk-IV electrorefiner. The ER is located in the hot cell of the Fuel Conditioning Facility at the Materials and Fuels Complex. Descriptions of the major components of the ER and the process in general have been provided elsewhere [2]. Salt and cadmium levels were measured, and multiple samples were obtained prior to performing the integrated test to establish an ER baseline for assessing the test results. The test consisted of four electrorefining batches of spent driver fuel with approximately 50 kg heavy metal. Typically, three to four ER runs are required to complete a batch. Fig. 1 shows pictures of the cathodes produced by three electrorefining runs during the second batch. The cathode No. 3 in the figure has clearly different morphology than that of the first two. The cathodes produced by the other three batches have the similar morphology as those pictured. The first and second cathodes are ordinary uranium dendrite, and the third and fourth cathode show typically high Zr content morphology [3]. The end-point for each batch was determined by weighing each anode basket and assuring a net residue mass being equal or less than 3. 0 kg. The 3. 0 kg residue included any un-dissolved fuel constituents and adhering salt. Previous operating experience has shown that uranium dissolution in excess of 99. 7 wt% was achieved when using this established end-point. Cladding hull samples were taken from each basket after it was removed from the ER. The actinide dissolution efficiency will be evaluated when the analytical results become available.

40|$|High-density TiN (> 98 % of theoretical) {{has been}} {{prepared}} by hot pressing TiN powder with 2 - 4 wt. % Li{sub 2 }C 0 {sub 3 } at temperatures between 1150 - 1550 C and pressures of {approx} 40 - 50 MPa. The Li{sub 2 }C 0 {sub 3 } {{served as a}} fugitive sintering aid, enabling attainment of high density at low temperatures without adversely affecting the inherently good properties. Variation in processing variables and TiN powder characteristics resulted in material with various porosities. Measurement of mechanical properties such as flexural strength and fracture toughness showed that the high-density material has mechanical properties that are superior to those of several oxide ceramics. We have also quantified the effects of porosity on mechanical properties. In addition, adhesion and chemical stability tests were used to investigate graphite coated with TiN by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Pin-pull tests {{were used to determine}} coating adhesion and failure stresses were analyzed by Weibull statistics. All pin-pull tests resulted in fracture of the graphite substrate, rather than separation at the TiN/graphite interface. The data showed a good fit to the two-parameter Weibull expression, with a failure strength of 16. 4 MPa and Weibull modulus of 9. 3. Both the high-density TiN and the TiN coating on the graphite were exposed to a corrosive molten salt CaCl{sub 2 }- 7 wt. % CaO and a liquid metal alloy (Zn- 10 wt. % Mg) at 800 C for 168 h to determine chemical interactions. No reaction was detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. Thus, graphite coated with TiN by CVD combines the thermodynamic stability of TiN when exposed to reactive molten metals and salts, with the excellent machinability of graphite, and hence is promising for use in container vessels for <b>pyrochemical</b> <b>processing</b> of certain rare-earth and nuclear metals, where chemical inertness and good matching of thermal expansion coefficients are required...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pyrochemical</b> <b>processing</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in development of proliferation- resistant nuclear fuel cycles. At the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), a pyrochemical process has been implemented for the treatment of spent fuel from the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II) in the last decade. Electrorefining in a high temperature molten salt is considered a signature or central technology in pyroprocessing fuel cycles. Separation of actinides from fission products is being demonstrated by electrorefining the spent fuel in a molten UCl 3 -LiCl-KCl electrolyte in two engineering scale electrorefiners (ERs). The electrorefining process is current controlled. The reference electrode provides process information through monitoring of the voltage difference between the reference and the anode and cathode electrodes. This information is essential for monitoring the reactions occurring at the electrodes, investigating separation efficiency, controlling the process rate, and determining the process end-point. The original reference electrode has provided good life expectancy and signal stability, but is not easily replaceable. The reference electrode used a vycor-glass ion-permeable membrane containing a high purity silver wire with one end positioned in ~ 2 grams of LiCl/KCl salt electrolyte with a low concentration (~ 1 %) AgCl. It was, however, a complex assembly requiring specialized skill and talent to fabricate. The construction involved multiple small pieces, glass joints, ceramic to glass joints, and ceramic to metal joints all assembled in a high purity inert gas environment. As original electrodes reached end-of-life it was uncertain if the skills and knowledge were readily available to successfully fabricate replacements. Experimental work has been conducted to identify a simpler electrode design while retaining the needed long life and signal stability. This improved design, based on an ion-permeable membrane of mullite has been completed. Use of the silver wire and electrolyte composition remains the same. The resulting design maximizes the use of commercial components and can be fabricated with commonly available skills. This has resulted in a significant reduction of effort and cost to fabricate replacements. The piece count requiring assembly in a high purity glove box atmosphere has been reduced by over half and all specialized joints have been eliminated. The new design has been tested in a lab scale electrorefiner and has also been successfully scaled up and installed in the engineering scale electrorefiners...|$|E
40|$|The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) Proliferation Resistance and Physical Protection (PR&PP) Working Group has {{developed}} a methodology for the PR&PP evaluation of advanced nuclear energy systems. The methodology is organised as a progressive approach applying alternative methods {{at different levels of}} thoroughness as more design information becomes available and research improves the depth of technical knowledge. The GIF Proliferation Resistance and Physical Protection (PR&PP) Working Group developed a notional sodium cooled fast neutron nuclear reactor, named the Example Sodium Fast Reactor (ESFR), for use in developing and testing the methodology. The ESFR is a hypothetical nuclear energy system consisting of four sodium-cooled fast reactors of medium size, co-located with an on-site dry fuel storage facility and a Fuel Cycle Facility with <b>pyrochemical</b> <b>processing</b> of the spent fuel and re-fabrication of new ESFR fuel elements. The baseline design is an actinide burner, with LWR spent fuel elements as feed material processed on the site. In the years 2007 and 2008 the GIF PR&PP Working Group performed a case study designed to both test the methodology and demonstrate how it can provide useful feedback to designers even during pre-conceptual design. The Study analysed the response of the entire ESFR system to different proliferation and theft strategies. Three proliferation threats were considered: Concealed diversion, Concealed Misuse and Abrogation. An overt theft threat was also studied. One of the objectives of the case study is to confirm the capability of the methodology to capture PR&PP differences among varied design configurations. To this aim Design Variations (DV) have been also defined corresponding respectively to a) a small variation of the baseline design (DV 0), b) a deep burner configuration (DV 1), c) a self sufficient core (DV 2), and c) a breeder configuration (DV 3). This paper builds on the approach followed for the qualitative assessment of the ESFR baseline design for a misuse scenario, and presents both the approach and the results of the assessment for the design variations DV 0 and DV 1. The results are then critically compared with those previously obtained for the baseline design and lessons learned are derived both on the system designs and on the methodology. JRC.
