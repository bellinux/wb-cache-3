40|$|Abstract. Modifing {{wheat straw}} pulp fibers via in situ graft {{copolymerization}} has {{been regarded as}} one of the effective approaches to improve paper properties. In this work,modified fibers were prepared by in situ graft copolymerization of caprolactam onto fibers surface using <b>potassium</b> persulphate-sodium <b>bisulfite</b> as a free radical initiator under alkaline medium. The optimum process parameters of the grafting reaction were followed: the ratio of modifier dosage to fiber was 0. 5,the ratio of initiator dosage to fiber was 0. 1, the ratio of sodium <b>bisulfite</b> to <b>potassium</b> persulphate was 4 : 5, pulp consistency was 5 %,the reaction time was 2 h,the reaction temperature was at 60 ˚C. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was performed to confirm the existence of the grafted copolymers on the surface of fibers. Furthermore, the paper physical properties of the grafted pulp are improved remarkably...|$|R
50|$|Because Tran {{does not}} add food {{coloring}} to the sauce, each bottle varies in color. At {{the beginning of}} the harvest season, the chiles are greener and therefore, the sauce yields a more muted-red color. Later in the season, the sauce produced is bright red. In order to make the sauce, after the chiles are harvested, they are washed, crushed, and mixed with the other ingredients including chili, sugar, salt, garlic, distilled vinegar, <b>potassium</b> sorbate, sodium <b>bisulfite</b> as preservatives, and Xanthan gum. The sauce is loaded into blue drums and then distributed into bottles. All blue drums and bottles are manufactured on-site as to cut waste and emissions down.|$|R

The rate of copolymerization decreased with increasing BuA content. The copolymer compositions {{were determined by}} H 1 NMR analysis and the reactivity ratios for VAc and BuA were calculated using the Fine-man-Ross equation and found to be r 1 = 0. 21 and r 2 = 3. 3 respectively.

The bottle lists the ingredients [...] "Chili, sugar, salt, garlic, distilled vinegar, <b>potassium</b> sorbate, sodium <b>bisulfite</b> and xanthan gum." [...] Huy Fong Foods' chili sauces are made from fresh red jalapeño chili peppers and contain no added water or artificial colors. Garlic powder is used rather than fresh garlic. The company formerly used serrano chilis but found them difficult to harvest. To keep the sauce hot, the company produces only up to a monthly pre-sold quota {{in order to use}} only peppers from known sources. The sauce is certified as kosher by the Rabbinical Council of California.|$|R
40|$|Preservation of {{sugarcane}} juice {{was examined}} {{to reduce the}} spoilage and to increase the shelf life of the juice using chemical preservatives. The preservation of the juice was carried out using Potassium Meta bi sulphite (KMS), spices and mild heat treatment at different combinations under refrigeration temperature. The result revealed that good quality beverage from sugarcane juice of variety Cos 767 with satisfactory storage stability of 60 days at refrigeration could be prepared from heat treated juice at 75 oC for 10 min after addition of 3. 0 ml lemon as flavor enhancer and source of citric acid (anti oxidant) and 1. 0 gm salt as flavoring compound, 0. 6 ml ginger as flavor enhancer per 100 ml of sugarcane juice. <b>Potassium</b> Meta <b>bisulfite</b> (KMS) addition {{at the rate of}} 225 ppm was found to be the best anti microbial agent. The lemon was able to lower the pH of sugarcane juice to 3. 01 which gave a preservative action and inhibit the growth of micro-organisms during storage. Potassium Meta bi sulphite is also a known yeast and mold inhibitor and is being used widely for the preservation of foods...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of the crystalline addition product formed between d-galactose and <b>potassium</b> <b>bisulfite</b> (potassium hydrogen sulfite) has been determined by X-ray diffraction analysis and compared with those structures reported for the related addition products from d-glucose and d-mannose. As with the latter two sulfonates, the d-galactose derived compound has an open-chain structure, with the carbon chain adopting a near planar zigzag conformation extending to the sulfur atom, similar to the d-mannose derivative but {{in contrast to the}} sickle conformation adopted by the d-glucose derivative. This last compound also differs in crystallising as a monohydrate. Inter-chain linking through cation coordination leads to a three dimensional network in the crystal...|$|E
40|$|Within our {{previous}} work [1] we developed computational models to predict strains with specific phenotypes (e. g. low ethanol resistance, growth at 30 ºC and growth in media containing galactose, raffinose or urea) from microsatellite allelic patterns. The {{objective of the}} present work was to gain {{deeper understanding of the}} phenotypic diversity of a heterogeneous Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain collection, using a large battery of tests with biotechnological relevance, and apply computational data mining algorithms to predict a strain´s potential {{to be used as a}} winemaking strain from a few selected phenotypic data. A S. cerevisiae collection was constituted, comprising 172 strains of different geographical origins and technological uses (winemaking, brewing, bakery, distillery, etc.). Phenotypic screening was performed considering 30 physiological traits that are important from an oenological point of view, such as ethanol tolerance, growth in synthetic must media at various temperatures or resistance to fungicides. Data was analyzed using Principal Component Analysis and some phenotypes were identified (growth in the presence of <b>potassium</b> <b>bisulfite,</b> growth at 40 ˚C, and resistance to ethanol) as being responsible for the highest strain variability. Statistical analysis revealed relevant associations between several phenotypes and the strains technological use. Based on the phenotypic data, naїve Bayesian classifier, as implemented in the software Orange [2], correctly assigned (AUC= 0. 70) most of strains from vineyards (73 %) and commercial strains (77 %) to the respective group. Data mining approaches identified, for the group of commercial strains, 18 phenotypic tests 	with the highest weight. Globally, the growth patterns of this group of strains in must containing iprodion (0, 05 mg/mL) or cycloheximide (0, 1 µg/mL) revealed to have the highest predictive score for the assignment of a strain as a commercial strain. The results obtained herein demonstrate the potential of computational approaches to explore phenotypic variability and to predict the probability of a S. cerevisiae strain to be used as a commercial strain.

40|$|Seeded and {{ab initio}} {{emulsion}} polymerizations of isoprene using redox initiation systems were investigated and suitable reaction conditions determined to prepare polyisoprene latexes with minimal cross-linking. Polymerizations initiated with the <b>potassium</b> persulfate/sodium <b>bisulfite</b> (KPS/SBS) redox couple {{had a significant}} inhibition period and low yield. Polymerizations initiated with the tertbutyl hydroperoxide/tetraethylene-pentamine redox couple showed reasonable yields and no apparent inhibition. It is postulated that the lipophilic nature of the t-butyl group plays a favorable role in the entry of hydroperoxide-initiated oligomeric radicals, while persulfate-initiated radicals {{are more likely to}} undergo aqueous phase termination before entry. The cross-linking reaction by benzoyl peroxide (BPO) at 70 degreesC was investigated using this lightly cross-linked polyisoprene latex. H- 1 NMR and gel permeation chromatography results were consistent with a reaction mechanism in which the radicals formed by the decomposition of BPO react exclusively with polyisoprene to abstract a hydrogen atom, and the resulting radicals react by termination to form cross-links. No loss of double bonds was found, suggesting that radical formation is overwhelmingly achieved by hydrogen abstraction and cross-linking occurs by termination between two radicals. Cross-linking was accompanied by chain scission, which was observed only {{at the beginning of the}} reaction. At low weight-fractions of polymer, the rate of cross-linking was dependent on the concentrations of BPO and abstractable hydrogens in a manner consistent with the postulated mechanism.
