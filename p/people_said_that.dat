At the beginning of the talks on 16 May, there was still hope that the two sides could come together even after the events that took place earlier in May, but Eisenhower refused to apologize and Khrushchev left the summit one day after it had begun. Some <b>people</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Khrushchev had overreacted to the event in an attempt to strengthen his own position, and for that, he was the one to blame for the collapse of the Four Power Paris Summit.|$|E

A long time ago, <b>people</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> “God’s Son” cast an immortal curse on him. Holding no clear intention, he’s just a monster that simply does what he feels like. He seems to travel around the world experimenting with the living and dead {{for the sake of his}} experiments, {{although}} he has apparently forgotten why he experiments. He has the appearance of a human but the body of a non-human – as seen in chapter eleven when he was struck with a magic bullet. He dislikes his “Cartaphilius” name.|$|E

An article in the Huddersfield Daily Examiner said that Mavis was one of Coronation Street's best-loved characters, describing her as timid and [...] "clad in sensible cardigan and shoes".

500|$|Adam {{suggests}} that Lie is best remembered for {{his contributions to}} Indonesian literature, with his publications well received by his contemporaries. Tio writes that [...] "old and young intimately read his (Lie's) writings, which were praised for their simple language, rhythm, clarity, freshness, and strength. The skill and accuracy with which he chose his words, the neatness and orderliness with which he arranged his sentences.... <b>People</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he was ahead of his time. He was likened to a large shining star, {{a stark contrast to}} the small, faded stars in the dark sky." [...] Further praise was awarded by other contemporaries, both native and Chinese, such as Ibrahim gelar Marah Soetan and Agus Salim. When ethnic Chinese writers became common in the early 1900s, critics named Lie the [...] "father of Chinese Malay literature" [...] for his contributions, including Siti Akbari and Tjhit Liap Seng.|$|E

500|$|Kirchherr is {{credited}} with inventing the Beatles' moptop haircut although she disagrees, saying: [...] "All that rubbish <b>people</b> <b>said,</b> <b>that</b> I created their hairstyle, that's rubbish! Lots of German boys had that hairstyle. Stuart [...] had {{it for a long}} while and the others copied it. I suppose the most important thing I contributed to them was friendship." [...] In 1995, Kirchherr told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "All my friends in art school used to run around with this sort of what you call Beatles haircut. And my boyfriend then, Klaus Voormann, had this hairstyle, and Stuart liked it very very much. He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the Brylcreem out of his hair and asking me to cut his hair for him. Pete [...] has really curly hair and it wouldn't work." [...] Kirchherr says that after she cut Sutcliffe's hair, Harrison asked her to do the same when she was visiting Liverpool, and Lennon and McCartney had their hair cut in the same style while they were in Paris, by Kirchherr's friend, Vollmer, who was living there at the time as an assistant to photographer William Klein.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Omega taking over Bullet Club's leadership, he and The Young Bucks formed their own subgroup within the stable, called [...] "The Elite". Omega and The Young Bucks {{came up with the}} idea for The Elite themselves, feeling the need to create something new after being forced by NJPW into Bullet Club and what Omega called a [...] "Too Sweet", [...] "Suck it" [...] parody of the nWo. Omega stated that he and The Young Bucks were The Elite, but accepted if NJPW continued calling them Bullet Club [...] "in parentheses" [...] as the stable was their [...] "cash cow". He explained the name change by stating that following Anderson, Gallows and Styles' departures from NJPW, [...] "Bullet Club [...] so much the Bullet Club anymore", adding that the stable [...] "had all sorts of wrestlers come and go. Some were good, some were bad, some were god-awful", but that [...] "there's a place you can go to watch the most ridiculous and entertaining stuff in pro wrestling, and it's The Elite". Omega later added his opinion that Anderson, Gallows and Styles' departures had [...] "watered down" [...] Bullet Club's ranks, which is why he wanted to push The Elite to the forefront, claiming that when <b>people</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Bullet Club [...] been doing some really cool stuff", they always meant him and The Young Bucks and not the other members of the group.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Helbo quoted Rabbi Jonathan {{to teach}} that the firstborn {{should have come}} from Rachel, as [...] says, [...] "These are the generations of Jacob, Joseph," [...] but Leah prayed for mercy before Rachel did. On account of Rachel's modesty, however, God {{restored}} {{the rights of the}} firstborn to Rachel's son Joseph from Leah's son Reuben. To teach what caused Leah to anticipate Rachel with her prayer for mercy, Rav taught that Leah's eyes were sore (as [...] reports) from her crying about what she heard at the crossroads. There she heard people saying: [...] "Rebecca has two sons, and Laban has two daughters; the elder daughter should marry the elder son, and the younger daughter should marry the younger son." [...] Leah inquired about the elder son, and the <b>people</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he was a wicked man, a highway robber. And Leah asked about the younger son, and the <b>people</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he was [...] "a quiet man dwelling in tents." [...] So she cried about her fate until her eyelashes fell out. This accounts for the words of [...] "And the Lord saw that Leah was hated, and He opened her womb," [...] which mean not that Leah was actually hated, but rather that God saw that Esau's conduct was hateful to Leah, so he rewarded her prayer for mercy by opening her womb first..|$|E

2500|$|Michael Musto of The Village Voice {{commented on}} the media's {{reaction}} to the incident, saying, [...] "Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast {{was used as a}} diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. <b>People</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can." ...|$|E
