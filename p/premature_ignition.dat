50|$|The first {{failure was}} a {{launch of a}} KH-11 photoreconnaissance {{satellite}} on August 28, 1985 when the core stage suffered a propulsion system malfunction and was destroyed by Range Safety. The flight proceeded normally until core engine start at T+108 seconds. An abnormal start transient occurred and Engine 2 began experiencing thrust decay at T+112 seconds. At T+212 seconds, Engine 1 shut down, causing loss of attitude control. The onboard computer shut off Engine 2 at T+256 seconds and began a <b>premature</b> separation and <b>ignition</b> of the second stage. With the Titan now tumbling and headed back towards land, the destruct command was issued at T+272 seconds and the KH-11 crashed into the Pacific Ocean. In addition, during Stage 1's powered flight, the oxidizer tank began leaking N2O2 which was thought to have resulted in loss of lubrication to the Engine 1 turbopump and breakdown of the pinion gear.

40|$|Ammunition {{loaded into}} large calibre gun chambers, {{which have been}} heated by {{previous}} firings, can enter a hot-gun state; conservatively defined as hot if 50 rounds or more are fired in a four-hour period. In this state the temperatures of the explosive fill, such as Composition B, may easily exceed their qualification temperatures. This is potentially dangerous if the weapon misfires either by cook-off or <b>premature</b> shell <b>ignition.</b> Currently there are no standard tests {{that can be used}} to assess the behaviour of Composition B filled munitions in a simulated hot-gun condition. During firing some of the energy can be transferred to the explosive fill. Defects induced by melting and/or re-solidification of the Composition B will lead to a greater chance of accidental initiation of the explosive due to setback forces creating hotspots and ultimately resulting in an accidental in-bore explosion. The aim of this research was to investigate the conditions of this accidental initiation of Composition B in a hot gun situation at the time the projectile is likely to be cleared from the gun. It investigated whether this situation can be simulated cost effectively by examining the sensitivity of Composition B samples that were thermally conditioned in accordance with calculated temperature-time profiles. A target assembly was designed to mimic setback forces by using projectile impact. A series of tests conducted on these composition B filled targets, which had been subjected to hot gun conditions, were performed at the Cranfield Ordnance Test and Evaluation Centre (COTEC) to simulate setback effects at shot start. Mechanical energy was delivered by an impacting sabot launched from a nitrogen gas powered gun.

40|$|A {{castable}} inhibitor {{is applied}} to the aft face of the Space Shuttle Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) forward segment propellant grain to control propellant surface burn area. During fabrication, the propellant surface is trimmed prior to the inhibitor application. This produces a potential for small propellant chips to remain undetected on the propellant surface and contaminate the inhibitor during application. The concern was that undetected propellant chips in the inhibitor might provide a fuse path for <b>premature</b> propellant <b>ignition</b> underneath the inhibitor. To evaluate the fuse path potential, testing was performed on inhibitor samples with embedded propellant. The internal motor environment was simulated with a calibrated CO 2 laser beam directed onto a sample which was placed in a 4100 kPa (600 psi) nitrogen pressurized bomb (laser bomb). The testing showed definitive results pertaining to fuse path formation. Embedded propellant chips did not autoignite until the receding heat affected inhibitor surface reached, or passed, the propellant chip. Samples with embedded propellant chips in alignment did not propagate ignition from one chip to another with separation distances as small as 0. 010 cm(0. 004 inc) and some as little as 0. 0051 cm (0. 002 in). Propellant chips with volumes approximately less than 0. 025 cu cm (0. 0015 cu in) (which did not propagate ignition) did not increase the inhibitor material decomposition depth more than the resulting void cavity of the burned out propellant chip. In addition, the depth of this void cavity did not increase until it was overtaken by the surrounding material decomposition depth. This was due, in part, to the retention of the protective inhibitor char layer. Samples with embedded propellant strings, whose thicknesses were below 0. 023 cm (0. 009 in), did not propagate ignition. Propellant string thicknesses above 0. 038 cm (0. 015 in) did propagate ignition.

50|$|The {{difference}} between the exhaust and intake pressures and temperatures means that some increase in efficiency can be gained by use of a turbocharger, removing from the exhaust flow {{some part of the}} remaining energy and transferring that to the intake flow to increase the intake pressure. A gas turbine can extract useful work energy from the exhaust stream and that can then be used to pressurize the intake air. The pressure and temperature of the exhausting gases would be reduced as they expand through the gas turbine and that work is then applied to the intake gas stream, increasing its pressure and temperature. The transfer of energy amounts to an efficiency improvement and the resulting power density of the engine is also improved. The intake air is typically cooled so as to reduce its volume as the work produced per stroke is a direct function of the amount of mass taken into the cylinder; denser air will produce more work per cycle. Practically speaking the intake air mass temperature must also be reduced to prevent <b>premature</b> <b>ignition</b> in a petrol fueled engine; hence, an intercooler is used to remove some energy as heat and so reduce the intake temperature. Such a scheme both increases the engine's efficiency and power density.|$|E
5000|$|Cryogenic-liquid-fueled rockets {{keep their}} {{propellants}} in insulated tanks. These tanks are never completely filled {{to allow for}} expansion. In micro-gravity conditions the cryogenic liquids are without a free surface existing in a slushy state between solid, liquid, and gas. In this mixed state, ullage gases may be sucked into the engines, which is undesirable. Small rocket engines, called [...] "ullage motors", are sometimes used to settle the propellant prior to the main engine ignition to allow {{the formation of a}} temporary free surface (with a distinct boundary between liquid and gas states). These motors provide acceleration that moves the main engine liquid propellants to the bottom of their tanks ("bottom" [...] in this usage always meaning relative to the alignment of the main motor the ullage motors are serving), so they can be pumped into the engine plumbing.

5000|$|<b>Premature</b> <b>ignition</b> of {{ammunition}} from {{heat in the}} chamber, known as cook-off, was a major problem with early prototypes of the G11 where synthetically bound nitrocellulose, formed into blocks, was used. Normally, when a bullet is fed into a chamber its case insulates the propellant from igniting until its impact-sensitive primer is struck by a firing pin or striker. The case aids in insulating the propellant from {{the heat of the}} chamber and it takes time for the temperature to rise sufficiently, inside a chambered round, to ignite the propellant. In addition, in a traditional rifle, extracting a hot case removes heat from the system. As a result of doing away with traditional cases, the G11 became a safety hazard and had to be withdrawn from the 1979 NATO trials. The high rate of fire and lack of cartridge cases made cooking-off a significant problem since the heat buildup in the G11 chamber was immense, due to the chamber having no provision for cooling, as with a reciprocating bolt system which allows hot air to leave the chamber when the bolt is retracted and the chamber is exposed to air. The vertically swivelling chamber furthermore made gas sealing at each end at such high pressures impractical, as opposed to a cross-sectional round-inside-round bolt-to-chamber fit with appropriate gas sealing [...]|$|E
5000|$|Hydrogen {{is being}} {{researched}} as a fuel for vehicles because it produces no carbon dioxide emissions. If hydrogen fuel becomes more popular, {{it has the}} potential to be less expensive than other fuels, if low-cost production via electrolysis can be implemented. Hydrogen can be used and created in fuel cells to power electric motors or burnt directly in combustion engines. BMW has developed a bivalent internal combustion engine that can switch between petroleum and liquid hydrogen fuels. In gasseous form, hydrogen is difficult to store and has a low volumetric energy density. It can be produced in many different ways, but many of the methods produce carbon dioxide. The most promising method is electrolysis. Safety of the hydrogen storage tanks in the event of an accident has been investigated, and various tests show that they do not present any problems. [...] When used as a fuel, hydrogen has a wide range of flammability and low ignition energy. These properties allow hydrogen to be burned using a wide range of air-fuel mixtures, but problems arise with <b>premature</b> <b>ignition.</b> Crankcase ventilation is very important when burning hydrogen, because of the low ignition energy. Proper ventilation is needed to prevent ignition in the crankcase and the formation of water in the engine oil. Hydrogen and natural gas are very similar as fuels, so the differences between the components needed to burn them are trivial, and interoperable systems are easily made.|$|E

The carbureted 2 -stroke engines are characterized by high levels of hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter emissions. Despite its poor emissions, carbureted 2 - stroke engines remain a popular power source for small appliances like lawnmower because of its low cost and high power to weight ratio.

40|$|X-ray {{timing of}} the accretion-powered {{pulsations}} during the 2003 outburst of the accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J 1814 - 338 has revealed variation in the pulse time of arrival residuals. These can be interpreted in several ways, including spin-down and wandering of the fuel impact point around the magnetic pole. In this Letter we show that the burst oscillations of this source are coherent with the persistent pulsations, to the level where they track all of the observed fluctuations. Only one burst, which occurs at the lowest accretion rates, shows a significant phase offset. We discuss what might lead to such rigid phase-locking between the modulations in the accretion and thermonuclear burst emission, and consider the implications for spin variation and the burst oscillation mechanism. Wandering of the fuel impact hot spot around a fixed magnetic pole seems the most likely cause for the accretion-powered pulse phase variations. This means that the burst asymmetry is coupled to the hot spot, not the magnetic pole. If <b>premature</b> <b>ignition</b> at this point (due to higher local temperatures) triggers a burning front that stalls before spreading over the entire surface, the resulting localized nuclear hot spot may explain the unusual burst and burst oscillation properties of this source.
