5|$|Being highly {{arboreal}} and {{the most}} frugivorous of the lemurs, they thrive only in <b>primary</b> <b>forest</b> with large fruiting trees, where they {{spend most of their}} time in the upper canopy.

5|$|The {{forest at}} Ambohimanga benefited from {{customary}} protection and today represents {{the largest of}} the last remaining fragments of <b>primary</b> <b>forest</b> that formerly covered the highlands. It contains a representative assortment of native tree and plant species, in particular the endemic tree zahana (phyllarthron madagascariensis) and a variety of indigenous medicinal plants, many possessing traditional or spiritual importance. Examples include the native bush Anthocleista, traditionally believed to attract lightning and often planted in clusters beside villages; the Dracaena plant, traditionally used for hedges and planted at sacred sites in valleys or other natural features where people would come to communicate with ancestral spirits; and the Phyllarthron vine, which was planted in sacred thickets and harvested for its wood, which was traditionally used to fashion handles for diverse tools. The recent and growing presence of two foreign species (golden bamboo and lantana) threaten the integrity of the site's ecosystem. The local management authority is currently engaged in activities to eradicate the encroaching vegetation.|$|E
50|$|Wedge-capped capuchins prefer {{undisturbed}} <b>primary</b> <b>forests</b> {{in which}} they can move through the canopy (locomotion and limb morphology). They occupy the rainforests of northern Brazil and Venezuela, as well as the drier forests along riverbeds in Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. These habitats vary in terms of forest height, composition, and continuity. When wedge-capped capuchins have the option between dense high-canopy <b>primary</b> <b>forests</b> and more fragmented, lower forests, they generally inhabit the <b>primary</b> <b>forests.</b>|$|R
50|$|Depending on the forest, the {{development}} of primary characteristics may take anywhere from a century to several millennia. Hardwood forests of the eastern United States, for example, can develop primary characteristics {{in one or two}} generations of trees, or 150-500 years. Often the disruption is the result of human activity, such as logging, but natural phenomena that produce the same effect are often included in the definition. Secondary forests tend to have trees closer spaced than <b>primary</b> <b>forests</b> and contain less undergrowth than <b>primary</b> <b>forests.</b> Secondary forests typically were thought to lack biodiversity compared to <b>primary</b> <b>forests,</b> however this has been challenged in recent years. Usually, secondary forests have only one canopy layer, whereas <b>primary</b> <b>forests</b> have several.|$|R

25|$|Since 1991, India has {{reversed}} the deforestation trend. Specialists of the United Nations report India's forest {{as well as}} woodland cover has increased. A 2010 study by the Food and Agriculture Organisation ranks India amongst the 10 countries with the largest forest area coverage in the world (the other nine being Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, United States of America, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Australia, Indonesia and Sudan).

25|$|Host {{plants that}} are taxonomically related show more similar EcM fungal {{communities}} than do taxa that are more distantly related. Molecular phylogenetic {{studies have shown that}} fungi derived from a common ancestor are more likely to show host specificity to {{plants that are}} taxonomically related. Host successional status may also play a role in determining EcM fungal communities, as well as affecting the number of EcM fungal species associated with an individual host species. Other indirect factors can also {{play a role in the}} EcM fungal community, such as leaf fall and litter quality, which subsequently affect calcium levels and soil pH. Even establishment timeframe of the host species can have an effect, with lower EcM fungal richness associated with hosts from a secondary forest than from a <b>primary</b> <b>forest.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of trogons are birds of tropical and subtropical forests. They have a cosmopolitan {{distribution in the}} worlds wet tropics, being found in the Americas, Africa and Asia. A few species are distributed into the temperate zone, with one species, the elegant trogon, reaching {{the south of the}} United States specifically southern Arizona and the surrounding area. The Narina trogon of Africa is slightly exceptional in that it utilises a wider range of habitats than any other trogon, ranging from dense forest to fairly open savannah, and from the Equator to southern South Africa. It is the most widespread and successful of all the trogons. The eared quetzal of Mexico is also able to use more xeric habitats, but preferentially inhabits forests. Most other species are more restricted in their habitat, with several species being restricted to undisturbed <b>primary</b> <b>forest.</b> Within forests they tend {{to be found in the}} mid-story, occasionally in the canopy.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{research}} of Jacques Boucher de Perthes has highlighted an occupation of the site of Abbeville (Menchecourt-les-Abbeville quarter) from the Acheulean era, one must imagine the place in Roman times as a succession of marshes, similar to marsh of Saint-Gilles which remains today. Further to the north, the entire plateau between the Authie and the Somme was covered in <b>primary</b> <b>forest.</b> The Romans had to break through this forest massif for {{the passage of the}} road from Amiens to the village of Ponches on the one hand, and on the other to the west by the road linking the Beauvaisis in Boulogne-sur-Mer. The couple Abbeville / Saint-Valery-sur-Somme {{is the key to the}} historical enigma of the landing of Magnus Maximus and his Britto-Roman troops in the spring of 383 AD (St-Valery = Leuconos > Pors Liogan; Abbeville = Talence > Tolente).

500|$|The {{species was}} {{historically}} found in mature or old-growth forests in Puerto Rico at all elevations, and in holes, cliffs, and other diverse habitats at lower elevations. The species {{could be found}} at medium elevations in the Guajataca State Forest (until 1910) and the Rio Abajo State Forest (until the 1920s), and at high elevations in the Carite State Forest (until the 1930s). Accounts from the early 1900s describe the parrots traveling away from the Luquillo forest and the Sierra de Cayey towards the main island's coast to find food. At the same time, the species was extirpated from Puerto Rico's smaller islands—Culebra, Vieques and Mona—and became restricted to five locations: two in karst-limestone areas, two in high montane rainforests and one in mangrove forest {{at the foot of}} the El Yunque National Forest. One of these karst regions, located in the northwestern part of Puerto Rico, was identified as a haven for the species. In particular, a region named Valle de las Cotorras (Valley of the Parrots), located between San Sebastián and Morovis, was home to a sizable population.
