500|$|The group first rehearsed in Shotton's {{house on}} Vale Road, {{but because of}} the noise his mother told them to use the {{corrugated}} air-raid shelter in the back garden. Rehearsals were moved from the cold air-raid shelter to Hanton's or Griffiths' house—as Griffiths' father had died in WWII, and his mother worked all day. The band also often visited Lennon's mother at 1 Blomfield Road, listening to her collection of rock and roll records by Elvis, Shirly and Lee's [...] "Let the Good Times Roll", and Gene Vincent's [...] "Be-Bop-A-Lula" [...] which they added to their repertoire. After his tenure on tea-chest bass, Nigel Walley became the group's manager. Walley sent flyers to local theatres and ballrooms, and put up posters designed by Lennon: [...] "Country-and-western, rock n' roll, skiffle band— The Quarrymen— Open for Engagements— <b>Please</b> <b>Call</b> Nigel Walley, Tel.Gateacre 1715".|$|E

[...] A month later in an interview, Sam Loeffler stated, [...] "Of the 14 guitars, we got two of 'em, {{and then we got}} some amplifiers back and our monitor system. So it's really, I mean it's cool because it's kind of like Christmas, only really weird. People have been calling us and saying, 'Hey, I bought this or that', and you know, we're just doing our best to buy it back from them.

Contrary to what early reports said, however, West was not actually taken to the hospital involuntarily; he was persuaded to do so by authorities. While the episode was first described as one of [...] "temporary psychosis" [...] caused by dehydration and sleep deprivation, West's mental state was abnormal enough for his 21 cancelled concerts to be covered by his insurance policy; he was reportedly paranoid and depressed throughout the hospitalization, but remains formally undiagnosed. The Paris robbery of his wife may have triggered the paranoia. On November 30, West was released from the hospital.|$|E

2500|$|Eventually, fearing his {{impending}} death might {{keep him from}} providing for his family, Ismail decided to have his wife's pregnancy terminated.

After a sudden explosion sound effect, Ismail's daughter (who was watching the event live on television) noticed he began to sweat profusely.

2500|$|Although Walley did not {{secure the}} group many paid engagements, he sent flyers to local theatres and ballrooms, put up posters {{designed}} by Lennon, paid for small advertisements in the Liverpool Echo and the Liverpool Daily Post, {{as well as}} business cards to be displayed in local shop windows: [...] "COUNTRY. WESTERN. ROCK N' ROLL. SKIFFLE - THE QUARRY MEN - OPEN FOR ENGAGEMENTS - <b>Please</b> <b>Call</b> Nigel Walley, Tel.Gateacre 1715". He secured two intermission concerts at the Gaumont cinema (near Penny Lane) on Saturday afternoons, and for the group to perform at parties and skiffle contests in the Liverpool area. Whilst playing golf with Dr. Joseph Sytner, Walley asked him if his son, Alan Sytner, could book The Quarrymen at The Cavern Club, in Mathew Street, {{which was one of}} three jazz clubs he managed. After passing on the information to his son, Sytner suggested that the group should play at the golf club first, so as to assess their talent. After playing at the golf club audition, he phoned Walley a week later and offered the group an interlude spot on 7 August 1957, playing skiffle between the performances of three jazz groups at The Cavern Club.|$|E

2500|$|Also in 1987, Orbison was {{inducted}} into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and initiated into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Bruce Springsteen, who concluded his speech with a reference to his own album [...] "Born to Run": [...] "I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector—but, most of all, I wanted to sing like Roy Orbison. Now, everyone knows that no one sings like Roy Orbison."

They were joined by Jackson Browne, T Bone Burnett, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Bonnie Raitt, Jennifer Warnes, James Burton, and k.d. lang.
