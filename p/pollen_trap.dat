50|$|Bee pollen {{is one of}} the {{byproducts}} of the hive. Pollen {{collection is}} usually not the main management objective. Pollen is collected by installing a <b>pollen</b> <b>trap</b> at the entrance of the bee hive. There are varying designs for pollen traps. The <b>pollen</b> <b>trap</b> makes access to the hive harder for the foraging bees. In the process of climbing through the <b>pollen</b> <b>trap</b> wires some pollen is loosened from the bee's pollen basket and falls into a collection container. Varying recommendations describe leaving the <b>pollen</b> <b>trap</b> on for a few days or for more extended periods. Pollen collection works best in an area with various pollen sources throughout the year.Fresh pollen can be frozen or dried.

40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} is a first attempt at {{applying}} the pollentrap method in the Central Stara Planina Mts by investigating the relationship between pollen assemblages and source vegetation. Five <b>pollen</b> <b>traps</b> were placed in Mt Shipchenska for four consecutive years (2002 – 2005). Moss samples were also collected from the immediate vicinity of the traps. The values obtained for the <b>pollen</b> <b>traps</b> are presented in percent and compared {{for each of the}} four years and with the values obtained for the moss samples. The results of the <b>pollen</b> <b>traps</b> are presented also as Pollen Accumulation Rate (grains cm- 2 yr- 1). They indicate that the Pinus pollen is overrepresented in the <b>pollen</b> <b>traps</b> and in the moss samples, but the moss samples show higher Pinus and Picea percentage than the <b>pollen</b> <b>traps,</b> probably due to the different type of collection and preservation of pollen grains. The cyclicity of the Fagus pollen productivity explains the variation in Fagus values in the pollen spectra.

40|$|Background. Volumetric <b>pollen</b> <b>traps</b> are {{commonly}} used to assess <b>pollen</b> exposure. These <b>traps</b> are well suited for estimating the regional mean airborne pollen concentration but are likely not to provide an accurate index of personal exposure. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that hair sampling may provide different pollen counts from those from <b>pollen</b> <b>traps,</b> especially when the pollen exposure is diverse. Methods. We compared pollen counts in hair washes to counts provided by stationary volumetric and gravimetric <b>pollen</b> <b>traps</b> in 2 different settings: urban with volunteers living in short distance from one another and from the static trap and suburban in which volunteers live in a scattered environment, quite far from the static <b>trap.</b> Results. <b>Pollen</b> counts in hair washes are in full agreement with trap counts for uniform pollen exposure. In contrast, for diverse pollen exposure,. individual pollen counts in hair washes vary strongly in quantity and taxa composition between individuals and dates. These results demonstrate that the pollen counts method (hair washes vs. stationary <b>pollen</b> <b>traps)</b> may lead to different absolute and relative contributions of taxa to the total pollen count. Conclusions. In a geographic area with a high diversity of environmental exposure to <b>pollen,</b> static <b>pollen</b> <b>traps,</b> in contrast to hair washes, do not provide a reliable estimate of this higher diversity...|$|R

Pollen representation was estimated {{by comparing the}} presence of plant taxa from a recent vegetation survey with the pollen spectra in moss polsters and <b>pollen</b> <b>traps.</b> In total, 73 pollen taxa were identified in the pollen rain. Per relevé, moss polsters and <b>pollen</b> <b>traps</b> contained 21 <b>pollen</b> taxa on average. Redundancy analyses (RDA) of pollen rain spectra against vegetation types yielded similar results for moss polsters and <b>pollen</b> <b>traps.</b> Spectra from forest, páramo, and cultivated field/meadows were well separated along the principal RDA axes, showing the potential to distinguish these vegetation types in pollen records.

Likewise, the pollen spectrum from a forest patch in páramo was similar to spectra from the nearby páramo matrix. The modern pollen spectra from cultivated field/meadows hardly contained pollen taxa typically found in páramo or forest. In both forest and páramo, pollen taxa with wind-dispersed pollination syndromes were overrepresented.

40|$|Abstract: Reference pollen {{data for}} use in {{interpreting}} fossil pollen assemblages may be either collected as surface samples or monitored by means of <b>pollen</b> <b>traps.</b> Surface samples {{can be obtained from}} moss polsters or lake-surface sediment, or exceptionally soil, leaf litter, or snow. The advantage of such samples is that a large number can be collected relatively quickly. Within the resulting pollen assemblage, however, the presence of each taxon has to be expressed in percentage terms. Reference material obtained from <b>pollen</b> <b>traps</b> offers more possibilities because pollen accumulation rates (PARs, grains cmâ 2 yearâ 1) can be calculated, and the record of each taxon can be considered independently. This allows comparisons over distance and between vegetation regions. The collection of such data using traps requires several years because the annual variation in pollen production, which is partly determined by climate, is great, and it is only the long-term average PAR that reflects vegetation composition. The number and location of samples and the amount of accompanying vegetation data should be appropriate for the research question to which they will be applied because there is no single standard that is suitable for the whole range of possible uses...|$|R

These barriers to interpreting the fossil record hinder {{our understanding of the}} past distributions of different Neotropical ecosystems and consequently cloud our knowledge of past climatic, biodiversity and carbon storage patterns. Modern pollen studies facilitate an improved understanding of how ecosystems are represented by the pollen their plants produce and therefore aid interpretation of fossil pollen records. To understand how to differentiate ecosystems palynologically, it is essential that a consistent sampling method is used across ecosystems. However, to date, modern pollen studies from tropical South America have employed a variety of methodologies (e. g. <b>pollen</b> <b>traps,</b> moss polsters, soil samples).

40|$|Introduction: One of {{the most}} {{important}} biological component of air is pollen, as its allergens are driver of airborne allergic diseases (1). Pollen allergy has a remarkable clinical impact over Europe. AIS LIFE ENV/IT/ 001107 project – Aerobiological Information Systems and allergic respiratory disease management ([URL] launched in 2014 (2), aims to assess the clinical impact of dissemination of pollen information. In this context, aerobiological monitoring was started in Pisa (Italy) for the first time. This contribution is the first report on aerobiological data ever collected in Pisa. The monitoring covers 21 months of operation of the <b>pollen</b> <b>trap.</b> Materials and Methods: The sampling procedure and the count of the airborne pollen grains and fungal spores is based on UNI 11108 : 2004. Aerobiological samples were obtained with a “Lanzoni VPPS 2000 ” <b>pollen</b> <b>trap</b> installed on top of the Biology Department building in Pisa, via Derna 1, about 17 m above the road pavement (coordinates 43. 718343 ° N, 10. 395110 ° E). Pollen grains of eight families: Betulaceae, Cupressaceae – Taxaceae, Asteraceae, Fagacee, Oleaceae, Urticaceae, Poaceae, Platanaceae and spores of Alternaria sp. pl. have been counted every day since 4 November 2014. Cycles of pollination and sporulation, the main pollen seasons (MPS), and the main spore season (MSS) were calculated according to 3, 4. Meteorological data were obtained from www. meteopisa. it and from a weather station placed next to the <b>pollen</b> <b>trap.</b> Results and discussion: We recorded a cumulative value of 25377. 55 pollen grains per m 3 and 1202. 85 fungal spores per m 3 from January to May 2016; the same values for the whole 2015 are 38781. 49 and 12846. 02 respectively. As regards woody species, the highest value was contributed by Cupressaceae – Taxaceae families, with 6820. 5 pollen grains in 2016 and 16032. 5 in 2015; followed by Platanaceae with 2229. 15 pollen grains in 2016 and 1625. 03 in 2015; Coryloideae subfamily with 2794. 55 pollen grains in 2016 and 866. 47 in 2015. As regards MPS, Betuloideae subfamily lasted 79 days in 2016 and 88 in 2015. The starting date for Betuloideae subfamily varied from 32 days in 2016 to 46 in 2015. As regards the ending date, Betuloideae varied with 111 days in 2016 and with 134 days in 2015. The average temperature of the period 1 January- 31 March was 10. 6 °C in 2016 and 9. 8 °C in 2015; in the same periods total rainfall was 391 mm and 205 mm respectively. Therefore our data may suggest a correlation between pollen concentration of woody species and meteorological factors, consistent with observations reported in other studies (5). Conclusions: The aerobiological monitoring campaign started in Pisa in 2014 is providing scientific data in support of an on-going European project addressing the clinical impact of dissemination of airborne pollen information. The aerobiological monitoring represents a unique tool to supply local real data to allergologists, enabling them to calibrate the drugs therapy for their patients and providing immediate advantages both for patients' health and for better management of the national healthcare system (6). The data obtained from the aerobiological monitoring will be useful for other applications as well, from biology and medicine to agriculture.

The aeropalynological survey was conducted by trapping airborne bioparticles such as pollen and fungal spores by operating vertical cylinder <b>pollen</b> <b>traps.</b> The traps were installed at different ecogeographical sites in Bangalore City. The results of qualitative and quantitative analysis of the atmospheric biopollutants are correlated with the meteorological parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and cloud cover. It is seen that generally the higher temperature and lower relative humidity enhance the liberation and distribution of pollen in the atmosphere; whereas the higher humidity and lower temperatures trigger the liberation and distribution of fungal spores in the atmosphere. Atmospheric pollen count is drastically reduced during the rainfall. Â© 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring {{surveys have}} been carried out in Scotland since 2006. From 2006 to 2012 these were postal surveys. Random {{selection}} of the survey sample has been used since 2008. In 2013 the survey was mostly carried out online, using LimeSurvey ([URL] making use of email contact addresses in the membership records of the Scottish Beekeepers’ Association (SBA). Typically about 85 % of the participants voluntarily provide contact details, some including email contacts, as part of their survey return, indicating {{that they are willing to}} be contacted to provide follow-up information. Therefore one possibility is to combine the details of these participants from the various surveys, to remove any duplicates and any stated non-beekeepers, check that the resulting beekeepers are still SBA members and still beekeepers, contact those remaining on the list and invite participation for those with <b>pollen</b> <b>traps</b> or who are prepared to acquire one. This may well not provide a very large sample, but would enable linking of pollen diversity to loss rates. Linking the CSI Pollen data collection to a single annual sample may not be successful as random selection may well not include those with <b>pollen</b> <b>traps.</b> As good geographical coverage is more important for a picture of pollen diversity than random selection, for estimation of biodiversity alone, two other possibilities are to publish an invitation to participate online and in the SBA publication for beekeepers, or to make use of local associations to recruit participants for better coverage of Scotland. This last option is the most likely to enable mapping of the number of pollen sources to postcodes. We are investigating recoding of the existing forage data from past surveys to obtain the number of forage sources to relate that to colony losses, however the stated number of sources in questionnaire data is likely to be unreliable owing to variation in keenness of observation of the beekeeper of their bees and their environment. We will briefly discuss these matters and known forage sources in Scotland...|$|R
