40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{evolution}} of relatively young <b>purchasing</b> <b>groups.</b> Although previous research focussed on macro-evolutionary phases of <b>purchasing</b> <b>groups,</b> no attention has yet {{been paid to the}} intra-phase developments, the so-called ‘micro-evolutions’. Insight into micro-evolutions is crucial to better understand how <b>purchasing</b> <b>groups</b> (can) develop over time. We conducted three in-depth case studies in different countries and identified five dimensions of micro-evolutions: member relationships, objectives, activities, organisation, and resources. For each dimension, we provide an overview of micro-evolutions to guide <b>purchasing</b> <b>groups</b> in developing the dimension. We conclude that the dimension ‘activities’ is very important and that <b>purchasing</b> <b>groups</b> do not have to develop the dimensions simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly, {{public sector}} {{organizations}} collaborate to buy products and services. They collectively form <b>purchasing</b> <b>groups</b> to deliver more value for money.

Although previous research provides general descriptions of life-cycle phases, {{little attention has been}} paid to detailed small-scale developments that take place within each life-cycle phase. As a result, little knowledge is available about small-scale developments of <b>purchasing</b> <b>groups.</b> More insight is important in order to better understand how <b>purchasing</b> <b>groups</b> can develop over time from one life-cycle phase into another. Three in-depth case studies from different countries off er a unique comparative overview of smallscale developments in these early life-cycle phases for their five dimensions. Most small-scale problems follow a predictable path, but the way in which the <b>purchasing</b> <b>groups</b> deal with such problems differs depending on the specific situation of the group...|$|R

40|$|Several {{alternative}} {{forms of}} trade in the agro-food market are spreading in Italy at local and global levels, namely: Farmers’ Market; Solidarity <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Groups,</b> Organized Demand and Supply Groups; Product Adoptions; Solidarity Trade Districts; Farm Shops. These have been introduced {{as a reaction to}} the global standardization and homologation of agricultural products leading to biodiversity loss. This research aims at examining more in detail how social and economic relations are connected in the new food market channels. The main result focuses on the central role of relational communication between the subjects involved in the process. Communication means the sharing of information about products, producers and farming systems. In the different forms of alternative circuits in the agro-food system, the attention is mainly focused on a particular type of product trade, the Solidarity <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Groups.</b> Solidarity <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Groups</b> consist of people meeting to make collective purchases of different food and non-food products. People who are part of the buying groups are linked by shared consumption choices. The producers and products to be bought are chosen carefully according to farming methods, normally organic, and producer characteristics favouring small farmers. The case study analysis was developed from a direct survey. The questionnaires were sent by mail to the representatives of Solidarity <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Groups</b> of Northeastern Italy (Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia and Trentino). 202 questionnaires were collected from 24 Solidarity <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Groups</b> registered on the official SPG web site and 5 from unregistered SPG sites. The analysis of the answers given by the consumers shows the role of relational communication which is the basis of the social network built up through consumers and producers on the local scale. The results of this research were interpreted by using economic theories based on communication and relationship such as the Stewardship Theory (Davis et al., 1997) Relational communication is the taxonomical key which makes the Solidarity <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Groups</b> different from the other alternative circuits in agro-food market...|$|R

40|$|<b>Purchasing</b> in <b>groups</b> is {{a concept}} that is {{becoming}} increasingly popular in both the private and public sector. Often, the advantages such as lower purchase pricese, learning from each other, and reduced transaction costs outweigh set-up and management costs and drawbacks such as disclosure of sensitive information and the fear of free-riding group members. The concept is not always successful though. Still, it has received relatively little attention in management research. In this thesis, we study the establishment and management of <b>purchasing</b> <b>groups.</b> We define <b>purchasing</b> <b>groups</b> as organizations in which horizontal cooperative purchasing takes place. We define horizontal cooperative purchasing as the operational, tactical, and/or strategic cooperation between two or more organizations in one or more steps of the purchasing process by pooling and/or sharing their purchasing volumes, information, and/or resources...|$|R
