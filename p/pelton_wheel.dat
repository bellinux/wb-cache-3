2500|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries {{there were many}} flax mills around Te Uku. The longest lived started about 1868, when Wallis Brothers used a water-wheel to drive a mill at Okete Falls. The {{overshot}} wheel {{was replaced by a}} <b>pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> in 1902. In 1925, due to shortage of flax, [...] the <b>pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> was attached to a generator and the flax mill closed.|$|E
2500|$|As with mills {{elsewhere}} in the country, they succumbed to shortage of flax due to fires, drainage and grazing. Little remains; a few parts of Okete mill lie near the falls and its <b>pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> stands outside Raglan museum. Of George Leakey's 1900s mill on the Okete stream, the mill race was, in 1975, still visible [...] "for several 100 yards" [...] below St Paul's cemetery.|$|E
2500|$|All of the British {{systems were}} {{designed}} to provide power for intermittent processes, such as the operation of dock gates or cranes. The system installed at Antwerp was somewhat different, in that its primary purpose was the production of electricity for lighting. It was commissioned in 1894, and used pumping engines producing a total of [...] to supply water at [...] Ellington, writing in 1895, stated that he {{found it difficult to}} see that this was an economical use of hydraulic power, although tests conducted at his works at Chester in October 1894 showed that efficiencies of 59 per cent could be achieved using a <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> directly coupled to a dynamo.|$|E
50|$|Hardeland is {{connected}} to the grid with a 22 kV line to Litledalen. The site uses three <b>pelton</b> <b>wheels</b> with 14 MW generators, and average yearly output is 123 GWh.|$|R
50|$|Because {{water and}} most liquids are nearly incompressible, {{almost all of}} the {{available}} energy is extracted in the first stage of the hydraulic turbine. Therefore, <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheels</b> have only one turbine stage, unlike gas turbines that operate with compressible fluid.|$|R
50|$|A 1905 vintage {{power house}} {{is still in}} service for Public Service Company, a {{subsidiary}} of Xcel Energy, with two <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheels</b> powering a single 1904 General Electric generator, with output of 2,400 volts, and 1,082 amperes at a speed of 225 R.P.M.|$|R
2500|$|Improving {{on earlier}} and less {{efficient}} water turbine designs in one historic mill town, the new Francis turbine {{was created in}} 1848, using scientific principles and testing methods producing a turbine design of 90% efficiency. More importantly, Francis's mathematical and graphical calculation methods advanced turbine design and engineering and allowed confident design of high efficiency turbines to exactly match a site's flow conditions. In the 1870s and deriving from uses in the mining industry, the high efficiency <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> impulse turbine was developed to use hydropower under very different flow and pressure conditions. [...] Advances in dam design also progressed, with the completion of Old Aswan Dam being considered a milestone of engineering over nature. At {{the time of its}} construction, nothing of such scale had ever been attempted: it also {{became one of the first}} dams to be limited by conservation considerations.|$|E
60|$|Daylight devoted {{himself to}} the {{lightening}} of Dede's labors, {{and it was her}} brother who incited him to utilize the splendid water-power of the ranch that was running to waste. It required Daylight's breaking of extra horses to pay for the materials, and the brother devoted a three weeks' vacation to assisting, and together they installed a Pelting wheel. Besides sawing wood and turning his lathe and grindstone, Daylight connected the power with the churn; but his great triumph was when {{he put his arm around}} Dede's waist and led her out to inspect a washing-machine, run by the <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel,</b> which really worked and really washed clothes.|$|E
50|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 19th century, the {{invention}} of the <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> encouraged some mill owners to replace over- and undershot wheels with <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> turbines driven through penstocks.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{its only}} outflow was the Achenbach, feeding the Isar. Since 1927, when {{a power plant}} in Jenbach was finished, it {{primarily}} feeds the Inn, at a level difference of 380 m below. Eight <b>pelton</b> <b>wheels</b> at 500 RPM produce a total of 96 MW.|$|R
50|$|The {{power plant}} was {{originally}} built with four <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheels,</b> since {{replaced by a}} single Francis turbine capable of generating 1.2 megawatts. The station was designed in the Second Renaissance Revival style with two levels, the lower housing the generating equipment, the upper formerly housing switchgear.|$|R
50|$|Rutherford Creek Power {{was built}} in 2004 by a {{partnership}} between Cloudworks Energy, Innergex Renewable Energy and the Lil'wat First Nation. The plant uses a 9km penstock leading to a power house with two 25 MW <b>pelton</b> <b>wheels.</b> The plant has a IPP agreement to sell electricity to BC Hydro.|$|R
50|$|A <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> is {{an impulse}} design.|$|E
50|$|First, {{the runner}} is less {{expensive}} to make than a <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel.</b> Second, it doesn't need an airtight housing like the Francis. Third, it has higher specific speed and can handle a greater flow than the same diameter <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel,</b> leading to reduced generator and installation cost.|$|E

50|$|For over 110 years, the {{building}} was continuously used as a foundry. A California Historical Landmark plaque, No. 1012, and dated May 11, 1994, {{was added to the}} site in honor of the <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel's</b> history associated with the foundry. In 1986, the Nevada City Constitutional Commission and E Clampus Vitus added another marker.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pelton</b> {{patented}} his <b>wheel</b> {{as well as}} {{his novel}} design of the double cup runner, and in 1888 formed the <b>Pelton</b> Water <b>Wheel</b> Company in San Francisco to supply the growing demand for hydropower and hydroelectricity throughout the West and world-wide.|$|R
50|$|The {{concrete}} powerhouse is in a partly ruinous state, {{and options}} {{have been presented}} to stabilize or demolish the structure when the proposed new hydroelectric development is undertaken. The powerhouse was fed by two wood stave penstocks, 7 ft in diameter, running to <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheels</b> driving two 1.6 megawatt generators. The generator hall stands next to a heavily built transformer vault.|$|R

50|$|The {{bucket wheel}} design {{is also used}} to capture the water energy in water-wheels or water {{turbines}} like <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheels.</b> The buckets also have to be made of solid material to withstand the force of the water flow. Their shape is optimized according to their purpose.Other designs include vertical shaft wind turbines designs like on the Savonius wind turbine. In this case, the buckets have to be made of a light material.|$|R
5000|$|Gold was mined from quartz veins {{found in}} the black {{graphite}} slate. The Sumdum Mine is located 2.5 miles south of Sanford Cove. Two ledges constitute the Sumdum Chief and Bald Eagle Mines and [...] "have been mined {{to a depth of}} several hundred feet below their surface outcrops." [...] Supporting structures included a 10-stamp mill, 4 large Frue Vanners, 2 <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheels,</b> a wagon road, a short tramway, and a wharf.|$|R

25|$|The railway terminal, called Mountain Junction, {{was located}} {{at the corner of}} Lake Avenue and Calaveras Street in the unincorporated {{community}} of Altadena. The line was divided into 3 divisions: the Mountain Division, the Great Incline, and the Alpine Division. The mode of locomotion was electric traction railway, and a cable driven incline funicular. Electrical power for the railway consisted of several power generating stations equipped with either gas engines or <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheels,</b> depending on the availability of mountain water.|$|R
50|$|Reißeck has two {{hydroelectric}} power plants (Kraftwerk Kolbnitz and Kraftwerk Rottau) {{run by the}} Verbund power company. The water is collected in several reservoirs in the Reißeck (linked with the Kölnbrein Dam in the upper Malta valley) and Kreuzeck mountains and lead to the plant through five penstocks with a maximum altitude difference of about 1772m/5815 ft. Seven (Kraftwerk Kolbnitz) resp. four (Kraftwerk Rottau) <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheels,</b> generating a maximum electric power of 138 to 220 Megawatt each, provide an overall annual electricity production of 1013 mio Kilowatt hours.|$|R
5000|$|About 6,000 {{horsepower}} {{of electricity}} {{was required to}} operate the mines and mills. The big Salmon Creek power stations, owned by the company and erected {{at the same time}} as the mine and mill development, furnished the power. There were two stations, one at sea-level near the mouth of the stream, and the other at the upper end of the first basin at an altitude of 350 ft immediately below the falls. A concrete dam held in storage [...] of water as reserve to keep the <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheels</b> moving during the winter months.|$|R

50|$|In 1876, Allan {{bought out}} Thom {{and changed the}} {{business}} name to George Allan's Foundry and Machine Works. It was during Allan's ownership of the foundry that Lester Allan Pelton of Camptonville invented {{a new type of}} water wheel in the late 1880s. He brought it to Allan's foundry, where he and Allan tested it before manufacturing the first <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel.</b> When the foundry could not keep up with <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> orders, production for the <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheel</b> was moved to San Francisco, though limited production of it continued at Allan's foundry. In 1892, Allan brought his son, Albert D. Allan, into the business as his partner and the younger Allan became the successor sole proprietor.|$|E
50|$|The mill {{contained}} 10 stamps with 4 large Frue vanners, {{and when}} running at full capacity, 10 tons of rock were milled per {{day at a}} cost of US$0.50 per ton. An 18 in pipe 1200 ft in length brought the water from a flume, the lower end of which is 187 ft above the power plant, and with the aid of two <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheels,</b> 170 horsepower were generated. From the mill, a wagon road, together with a short tramway, lead to the wharf, and over this, the concentrates were hauled, and the conveying wagons returned with freight for the mine.|$|R
50|$|Small {{turbines}} (mostly under 10 MW) {{may have}} horizontal shafts, and even fairly large bulb-type turbines up to 100 MW or so may be horizontal. Very large Francis and Kaplan machines usually have vertical shafts because this makes {{best use of}} the available head, and makes installation of a generator more economical. <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheels</b> may be either vertical or horizontal shaft machines because {{the size of the}} machine is so much less than the available head. Some impulse turbines use multiple jets per runner to balance shaft thrust. This also allows for the use of a smaller turbine runner, which can decrease costs and mechanical losses.|$|R
5000|$|The quarry was lit by electricity, using 2000-candlepower arc lamps, and he {{installed}} reversible winches, {{which were}} driven by [...] motors. They could raise 3-ton blocks, {{when they were}} being loaded onto trucks, and had a high speed mode, which was used when the blocks were dragged across the floor. For the haulage of trucks along the main adit, he introduced a [...] mining locomotive, the first electric locomotive to work in Wales. It was a 4-wheel design, picking up power from an overhead wire, and {{is thought to have}} been built in the quarry workshops. The <b>Pelton</b> <b>wheels</b> were supplied by Gilbert Gilkes and Company Ltd of Kendal, as were the ones which supplemented the water wheels.|$|R
