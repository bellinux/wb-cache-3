5|$|In the remakes, after {{selecting}} a character, the player {{can change the}} character's starting abilities with five magical seeds, given at the tavern. Also, each character has a <b>personality</b> <b>trait</b> which affects {{the growth rate of}} their abilities. The Hero's personality is determined by the player's choices and actions during a dream sequence {{at the start of the}} game, while other characters' personalities are determined by their status at the end of the character generation process. Most personalities are available to both male and female characters, while a few are exclusive to male or female characters. A character's personality can be temporarily changed by equipping certain accessories, or permanently changed by using certain consumable books.|$|E

5|$|A {{follow-up}} study conducted 14 {{months after the}} original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the <b>personality</b> <b>trait</b> of Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the {{benefits and harms of}} hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long-term positive impact on their sense of well-being.|$|E
40|$|The present article reviews {{borderline}} <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> in a non-clinical population. Studies {{conducted in}} Japan {{on this topic}} have drawn their samples from either subclinical populations or adolescents known to be mentally unstable. Adolescents {{with a high level}} of borderline <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> have many difficulties in interpersonal relations as well as family conditions. Many studies from other countries have examined borderline <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> in non-clinical populations. These studies have revealed the following: (1) Borderline <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> have some clinical features. (2) Individual with borderline <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> typically lack skills in managing and understanding emotions. (3) Significant multivariate predictors and risk factors of borderline <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> exist. (4) Borderline <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> predict negative outcomes in academic and occupational achievement. This paper reveals that future studies are needed to better understand the etiology, development, and course of borderline <b>personality</b> <b>traits,</b> and shows how longitudinal research and case studies can support existing findings...|$|R
30|$|The {{personality}} of students indirectly influences their intentions {{to start a}} new business through their attitudes (Lüthje and Franke, 2003). The <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> can be categorised into two sets such as general and specific <b>personality</b> <b>traits.</b> The general <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> include openness to experience, neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, i.e. the big five; whereas, specific <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> comprise locus of control, need for achievement, autonomy, risk-taking, innovativeness and self-efficacy.

40|$|In {{the current}} study, we {{utilized}} a correspondent test {{to capture the}} way in which firms respond to women who exhibit masculine and feminine <b>personality</b> <b>traits.</b> In doing so, we minimized the potential for reverse causality bias and unobserved heterogeneities to occur. Women who exhibit masculine <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> have a 4. 3 percentage points greater likelihood of gaining access to occupations than those displaying feminine <b>personality</b> <b>traits.</b> In both male- and female-dominated occupations, women with masculine <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> have an occupational access advantage, as compared to those exhibiting feminine <b>personality</b> <b>traits.</b> Moreover, women with masculine <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> take up positions which offer 10 percentage points higher wages, in comparison with those displaying feminine <b>personality</b> <b>traits.</b> Furthermore, wage premiums are higher for those exhibiting masculine <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> in male-dominated occupations, than for female-dominated positions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first field experiment to examine the effect of masculine and feminine <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> on entry-level pay scales. As feminine <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> are stereotypically attributed to women, and these characteristics appear to yield fewer rewards within the market, they may offer one of many plausible explanations as to why women experience higher unemployment rates, whilst also receiving lower earnings, as compared to men...|$|R
5|$|Single-purpose {{characters}} {{needed a}} distinctive <b>personality</b> <b>trait</b> to quickly establish {{them with the}} player, rather than serving as a disposable item, while major characters had to reflect the player's progression and actions through the game. Mitsoda wrote the characters by thinking about who each character was, assigning them motivations determining why they were where they were, what they thought about the player and what they wanted from them. In accordance with a suggestion by fellow writer Chad Moore, the Malkavian player character has a dialog script distinct {{from that of the}} other eight clans; Mitsoda said {{it was one of the}} simpler aspects of the development cycle. He wrote the Malkavian script last, with time running out on development, and the overwork and lack of sleep contributed to what Mitsoda considered an unhealthy state of mind, ideal for writing insane dialog. He wanted to highlight their madness, without making it comical. Since the story is set during the Camarilla's takeover of Los Angeles, the team simplified the plot by only allowing the player to belong to one of the LA-based clans.|$|E

40|$|During many decades, sociologists have {{downplayed the}} role that <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> play in shaping individual’s lives. However, recent studies, mostly in economics, have shown the {{influence}} of these traits on a several educational and occupational outcomes. This thesis {{is an attempt to}} shed more light on this topic. By using longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, it first investigates how the Big Five <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> affect two important labor market outcomes: unemployment incidence and job mobility. The results from these first two articles show two things. First, <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> contribute importantly to processes of job mobility and job loss. Second, models including <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> fit better compare to models that exclude them. Additionally, the inclusion of <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> also improves our understanding of the underlying process in the labor market. The second part of this thesis focuses on how <b>personality</b> <b>traits</b> are transmitted from parents to their children. My results show that socialization processes are extremely important in the transmission and development of <b>personality</b> <b>traits.</b> Higher educated parents are more successful in promoting socially desirable and success-enhancing traits than lower educated ones. While there is a direct influence of the parent’s education on the development of children’s <b>personality</b> <b>traits,</b> the effect is mediated by different childrearing practices and by the use of external daycare. ...|$|R

25|$|According to the {{instrumental}} view, {{one explanation for}} greater subjective well-being among extraverts could be that extraversion helps {{in the creation of}} life circumstances, which promote high levels of positive affect. Specifically, the <b>personality</b> <b>trait</b> of extraversion is seen as a facilitator of more social interactions, since the low cortical arousal among extraverts results in them seeking more social situations in order to increase their arousal.|$|E
25|$|In psychology, trait theory (also called dispositional theory) is an {{approach}} {{to the study of}} human <b>personality.</b> <b>Trait</b> theorists are primarily interested in the measurement of traits, which can be defined as habitual patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion. According to this perspective, traits are relatively stable over time, differ across individuals (e.g. some people are outgoing whereas others are not), and influence behavior. Traits are in contrast to states which are more transitory dispositions.|$|E
25|$|The affective {{reactivity}} model {{states that}} {{the strength of a}} person's reactions to affect-relevant events are caused by people's differences in affect. This model is based on the reinforcement sensitivity theory by Jeffrey Alan Gray, which states that people with stronger behavioral activation system (BAS) are high in reward responsiveness and are predisposed to the <b>personality</b> <b>trait</b> of extraversion, while people with a stronger behavioral inhibition system (BIS) are lower in reward responsiveness and are more predisposed to <b>personality</b> <b>trait</b> of neuroticism and introversion. Therefore, extraverts are seen as having a temperamental predisposition to positive affect since positive mood induction has a greater effect on them than on introverts, thus extraverts are more prone to react to pleasant effects. For example, Gable, Reis, and Elliot (2000). found in two consecutive studies that people with more sensitive BIS reported higher levels of average negative affect, while people with more sensitive BAS reported higher levels of positive affect. Also Zelenski and Larsen (1999) found that people with more sensitive BAS reported more positive emotions during the positive mood induction, while people with more sensitive BIS reported more negative emotions during the negative mood induction.|$|E
