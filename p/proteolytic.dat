5|$|The proteasomal {{degradation}} pathway {{is essential}} for many cellular processes, including the cell cycle, the regulation of gene expression, and responses to oxidative stress. The importance of <b>proteolytic</b> degradation inside cells {{and the role of}} ubiquitin in <b>proteolytic</b> pathways was acknowledged in the award of the 2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Aaron Ciechanover, Avram Hershko and Irwin Rose.|$|E
5|$|Studies on Drosophila serpins {{reveal that}} Serpin-27A {{inhibits}} the Easter protease (the final protease in the Nudel, Gastrulation Defective, Snake and Easter <b>proteolytic</b> cascade) and thus controls dorsoventral patterning. Easter functions to cleave Spätzle (a chemokine-type ligand), {{which results in}} toll-mediated signaling. As well as its central role in embryonic patterning, toll signaling is also important for the innate immune response in insects. Accordingly, serpin-27A also functions to control the insect immune response. In Tenebrio molitor (a large beetle), a protein (SPN93) comprising two discrete tandem serpin domains functions to regulate the toll <b>proteolytic</b> cascade.|$|E
5|$|Although most serpins control <b>proteolytic</b> cascades, some {{proteins}} with a serpin structure are not enzyme inhibitors, {{but instead}} perform diverse {{functions such as}} storage (as in egg white—ovalbumin), transport as in hormone carriage proteins (thyroxine-binding globulin, cortisol-binding globulin) and molecular chaperoning (HSP47). The term serpin is used to describe these members as well, despite their non-inhibitory function, since they are evolutionarily related.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{discovery}} of the ubiquitin proteasome system, protein degradation in cells was thought to rely mainly on lysosomes, membrane-bound organelles with acidic and protease-filled interiors that can degrade and then recycle exogenous proteins and aged or damaged organelles. However, work by Alfred Goldberg in 1977 on ATP-dependent protein degradation in reticulocytes, which lack lysosomes, suggested the presence of a second intracellular degradation mechanism. This was shown in 1978 to be composed of several distinct protein chains, a novelty among proteases at the time. Later work on modification of histones led to the identification of an unexpected covalent modification of the histone protein by a bond between a lysine side chain of the histone and the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin, a protein that had no known function. It was then discovered that a previously identified protein associated with <b>proteolytic</b> degradation, known as ATP-dependent proteolysis factor 1 (APF-1), was the same protein as ubiquitin. The <b>proteolytic</b> activities of this system was isolated as a multi-protein complex originally called the multi-catalytic proteinase complex by Sherwin Wilk and Marion Orlowski. Later, the ATP-dependent <b>proteolytic</b> complex that was responsible for ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation was discovered and was called the 26S proteasome.|$|E
5|$|Other {{antiviral}} {{drugs in}} use target {{different stages of}} the viral life cycle. HIV is dependent on a <b>proteolytic</b> enzyme called the HIV-1 protease for it to become fully infectious. There is a large class of drugs called protease inhibitors that inactivate this enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Reduce <b>proteolytic</b> susceptibility. The rate {{at which}} {{proteins}} are broken down can have a large impact on their activity in cells. Since termini are often accessible to proteases, designing a circularly permuted protein with less-accessible termini can increase the lifespan of that protein in the cell.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms {{commonly}} include ecchymosis and swelling. The pain {{is generally}} {{more severe than}} bites from the copperhead, but less so than those from rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.). The formation of vesicles and bullae is less common than with rattlesnake bites, although necrosis can occur. Myokymia is sometimes reported. However, the venom has strong <b>proteolytic</b> activity {{that can lead to}} severe tissue destruction.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{two-thirds of}} human serpins perform {{extracellular}} roles, inhibiting proteases {{in the bloodstream}} in order to modulate their activities. For example, extracellular serpins regulate the <b>proteolytic</b> cascades central to blood clotting (antithrombin), the inflammatory and immune responses (antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, and C1-inhibitor) and tissue remodelling (PAI-1). By inhibiting signalling cascade proteases, they can also affect development. The table of human serpins (below) provides examples {{of the range of}} functions performed by human serpin, {{as well as some of}} the diseases that result from serpin deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Some protein {{complexes}} {{contain a}} large central cavity that is {{isolated from the}} remainder of the cytosol. One example of such an enclosed compartment is the proteasome. Here, a set of subunits form a hollow barrel containing proteases that degrade cytosolic proteins. Since these would be damaging if they mixed freely with {{the remainder of the}} cytosol, the barrel is capped by a set of regulatory proteins that recognize proteins with a signal directing them for degradation (a ubiquitin tag) and feed them into the <b>proteolytic</b> cavity.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease has}} been {{identified}} as a protein misfolding disease (proteopathy), caused by plaque accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid beta protein, and tau protein in the brain. Plaques are made up of small peptides, 39–43amino acids in length, called amyloid beta (Aβ). Aβ is a fragment from the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is a transmembrane protein that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival, and post-injury repair. In Alzheimer's disease, gamma secretase and beta secretase act together in a <b>proteolytic</b> process which causes APP to be divided into smaller fragments. One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of amyloid beta, which then form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as senile plaques.|$|E
5|$|In humans, this {{response}} is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on {{the surfaces of}} microbes. This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response. The speed of the response {{is a result of}} signal amplification that occurs after sequential <b>proteolytic</b> activation of complement molecules, which are also proteases. After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.|$|E
25|$|In invertebrates, pattern {{recognition}} proteins (PRPs) trigger <b>proteolytic</b> cascades that degrade proteins and control {{many of the}} mechanisms of the innate immune system of invertebrates—including hemolymph coagulation and melanization. <b>Proteolytic</b> cascades are important components of the invertebrate immune system because they are turned on more rapidly than other innate immune reactions {{because they do not}} rely on gene changes. <b>Proteolytic</b> cascades have been found to function the same in both vertebrate and invertebrates, even though different proteins are used throughout the cascades.|$|E
25|$|To achieve {{functional}} degradomics, the {{enzymatic activity}} of proteases must be analyzed. Methods {{have been developed}} to distinguish the <b>proteolytic</b> activity of different enzymes in biological samples and separate active proteases from their inactive forms, namely zymogen precursors and those proteases bound by inhibitors. Two techniques are activity-based probes (ABPs) and <b>Proteolytic</b> Signature Peptides (PSPs).|$|E
25|$|<b>Proteolytic</b> venom dismantles the {{molecular}} {{structure of the}} area surrounding and including the bite.|$|E
25|$|A seventh {{catalytic}} type of <b>proteolytic</b> enzymes, asparagine peptide lyase, {{was described}} in 2011. Its <b>proteolytic</b> mechanism is unusual since, rather than hydrolysis, it performs an elimination reaction. During this reaction, the catalytic asparagine forms a cyclic chemical structure that cleaves itself at asparagine residues in proteins under the right conditions. Given its fundamentally different mechanism, its inclusion as a peptidase may be debatable.|$|E
25|$|However, Norris (2004) warned {{this species}} has a {{relatively}} large venom yield containing high levels of <b>proteolytic</b> enzymes, especially in the adults. A publication he mentions by Rael et al. (1986) showed it contains at least three <b>proteolytic</b> hemorrhagins that degrade fibrinogen and cause myonecrosis, but no Mojave toxin. On the other hand, three specimens from Mexico studied by Glen et al. (1983) did have Mojave toxin and lacked hemorrhagic activity.|$|E
25|$|Tenderizers {{break down}} {{collagens}} {{to make the}} meat more palatable for consumption. They include <b>proteolytic</b> enzymes, acids, salt and phosphate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Proteolytic</b> {{cleavage}} -SLiMs {{can act as}} recognition {{sites of}} endo-peptidases resulting in the irreversible cleavage of the peptide at the SLiM.|$|E
25|$|Another {{way to make}} wheat less {{immunogenic}} is {{to insert}} <b>proteolytic</b> sites in the longer motifs (25-mer and 33-mer), facilitating more complete digestion.|$|E
25|$|A {{concentrate}} of <b>proteolytic</b> enzymes {{enriched in}} bromelain is approved in Europe for the debridement (removal of dead tissue) of severe burn wounds under the trade name NexoBrid.|$|E
25|$|Systemic enzyme therapy (consisting of {{combinations}} of <b>proteolytic</b> enzymes such as bromelain, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and papain) {{has been investigated}} in Europe to evaluate the efficacy in breast, colorectal, and plasmacytoma cancer patients.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{receptor}} dimerisation, after <b>proteolytic</b> cleavage {{into the}} α- and β-chains, the additional 12 amino acids remain {{present at the}} C-terminus of the α-chain (designated αCT) where they are predicted to influence receptor–ligand interaction.|$|E
25|$|Death {{effector}} domain (DED) : allows protein–protein binding by homotypic interactions (DED-DED). Caspase proteases trigger apoptosis via <b>proteolytic</b> cascades. Pro-Caspase-8 and pro-caspase-9 bind {{to specific}} adaptor molecules via DED domains and {{this leads to}} autoactivation of caspases.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{hookworm}} antigens {{have also}} been identified as potential candidates for vaccines. When adult worms attach to the intestinal mucosa of the human host, erythrocytes are ruptured in the worm’s digestive tract which causes the release of free hemoglobin which is subsequently degraded by a <b>proteolytic</b> cascade. Several of these proteins {{that are responsible for}} this <b>proteolytic</b> cascade are also essential for the worm’s nutrition and survival. Therefore, a vaccine that could induce antibodies for these antigens could interfere with the hookworm’s digestive pathway and impair the worm’s survival. Three proteins have been identified: the aspartic protease-hemoglobinase APR-1, the cysteine protease-hemoglobinase CP-2, and a glutathione S-transferase.|$|E
25|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{effects of}} Nimesulide {{are the result}} of its complex mode of action, which targets a number of key mediators of the inflammatory process such as: COX-2 mediated prostaglandins, free radicals, <b>proteolytic</b> enzymes, and histamine.|$|E
25|$|The Notch protein {{spans the}} cell membrane, {{with part of}} it inside and part outside. Ligand {{proteins}} binding to the extracellular domain induce <b>proteolytic</b> cleavage and release of the intracellular domain, which enters the cell nucleus to modify gene expression.|$|E
25|$|Antimicrobial {{peptides}} {{have been}} successively incorporated into topical therapeutics. A major challenge associated with systemic delivery of an antimicrobial peptides is their susceptibility to <b>proteolytic</b> degradation. That is, the peptides are quickly broken down when {{introduced in the}} bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|Chronic wounds {{also differ}} in makeup from acute wounds in that {{their levels of}} <b>proteolytic</b> enzymes such as elastase. and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are higher, while their {{concentrations}} of growth factors such as Platelet-derived growth factor and Keratinocyte Growth Factor are lower.|$|E
25|$|Plasmin is {{generated}} by <b>proteolytic</b> cleavage of plasminogen, a plasma protein synthesized in the liver. This cleavage is catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), which is synthesized and secreted by endothelium. Plasmin proteolytically cleaves fibrin into fibrin degradation products that inhibit excessive fibrin formation.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that {{protease}} enzymes become trapped in inactive antithrombin-protease complexes {{as a consequence of}} their attack on the reactive bond. Although attacking a similar bond within the normal protease substrate results in rapid <b>proteolytic</b> cleavage of the substrate, initiating an attack on the antithrombin reactive bond causes antithrombin to become activated and trap the enzyme at an intermediate stage of the <b>proteolytic</b> process. Given time, thrombin is able to cleave the reactive bond within antithrombin and an inactive antithrombin-thrombin complex will dissociate, however the time it takes for this to occur may be greater than 3 days. However bonds P3-P4 and P1'-P2' can be rapidly cleaved by neutrophil elastase and the bacterial enzyme thermolysin respectively, resulting in inactive antithrombins no longer able to inhibit thrombin activity.|$|E
25|$|Urokinase is a 411-residue protein, {{consisting}} of three domains: the serine protease domain, the kringle domain, {{and the growth}} factor domain. Urokinase is synthesized as a zymogen form (prourokinase or single-chain urokinase), and is activated by <b>proteolytic</b> cleavage between Lys158 and Ile159. The two resulting chains are kept together by a disulfide bond.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the physodic acid mentioned above, P.furfuracea also contains 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-3,6-dimethyl benzoic acid, atranorin, oxyphysodic acid, and virensic acid. Of these compounds, atranorin showed the highest inhibition of <b>proteolytic</b> enzymes trypsin and porcine pancreatic elastase. Research suggests that the biosynthesis of both atranorin and physodic acid {{is influenced by the}} cooperation of epiphytic bacteria.|$|E
25|$|However, venom B causes {{pronounced}} <b>proteolytic</b> and hemorrhagic effects, {{similar to}} the bites of other rattlesnake species; these effects are significantly reduced or absent from bites by venom A snakes. Risk to life and limb is still significant, as with all rattlesnakes, if not treated {{as soon as possible}} after a bite.|$|E
25|$|Prostatic {{secretions}} vary among species. They {{are generally}} composed of simple sugars {{and are often}} slightly alkaline. In human prostatic secretions, the protein content is less than 1% and includes <b>proteolytic</b> enzymes, prostatic acid phosphatase, beta-microseminoprotein, and prostate-specific antigen. The secretions also contain zinc with a concentration 500–1,000 times the concentration in blood.|$|E
25|$|<b>Proteolytic</b> venom is also dual-purpose: firstly, it is {{used for}} defense and to {{immobilize}} prey, as with neurotoxic venoms; secondly, many of the venom's enzymes have a digestive function, breaking down molecules in prey items, such as lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins. This is an important adaptation, as many vipers have inefficient digestive systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{detection}} of many antigens can be dramatically improved by antigen retrieval methods that act by breaking {{some of the}} protein cross-links formed by fixation to uncover hidden antigenic sites. This {{can be accomplished by}} heating for varying lengths of times (heat induced epitope retrieval or HIER) or using enzyme digestion (<b>proteolytic</b> induced epitope retrieval or PIER).|$|E
