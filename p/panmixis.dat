40|$|Many marine {{fish and}} {{invertebrates}} show a dual life history where settled adults produce dispersing larvae. The planktonic {{nature of the}} early larval stages suggests a passive dispersal model where ocean currents would quickly cause <b>panmixis</b> over large spatial scales and prevent isolation of populations, a prerequisite for speciation. However, high biodiversity and species abundance in coral reefs contradict this <b>panmixis</b> hypothesis. Although ocean currents are {{a major force in}} larval dispersal, recent studies show far greater retention than predicted by advection models. We investigated the role of animal behavior in retention and homing of coral reef fish larvae resulting in two important discoveries: (i) Settling larvae are capable of olfactory discrimination and prefer the odor of their home reef, thereby demonstrating to us that nearby reefs smell different. (ii) Whereas one species showed <b>panmixis</b> as predicted from our advection model, another species showed significant genetic population substructure suggestive of strong homing. Thus, the smell of reefs could allow larvae to choose currents that return them to reefs in general and natal reefs in particular. As a consequence, reef populations can develop genetic differences that might lead to reproductive isolation...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the evolution of the species phenotype (morphology and behaviour) when sexual organisms identify mutant traits by their unusual (or rare) appearance. Mate-seeking individuals are assumed, however, to have no means of distinguishing the occasional beneficial mutation from the others. We show that the resulting preference for mates with predominantly common traits (koinophilia) transforms the prevailing phenotype (as perceived by conspecifics) into an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS), as defined by Maynard-Smith (1974). This has far reaching evolutionary implications, permitting, in particular, the evolution of true 'group adaptations'. A subsidiary finding shows that koinophilia always has a substantial, immediate, selective advantage over <b>panmixis,</b> rendering koinophilia, itself, an ESS with respect to <b>panmixis.</b> This is particularly pronounced when the mutation rate is high, but beneficial mutations with high fitnesses are rare. The mean fitness of mutations has only a minor effect on the relative advantage of koinophilia. Articl...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Two {{bootstrap}} {{procedures are}} proposed to perform one- and two-sample tests on inbreeding coefficients for single loci by resampling over the genotypes.

As the fixation index of the underlying distribution becomes more extreme, higher sample sizes are required to obtain a reliable test. Two explicit formulae for the power of the two tests are estimated from Monte Carlo simulations, and a comparison with the classical chi-square test is made.

40|$|Most HIV {{replication}} {{occurs in}} solid lymphoid tissue, which has prominent architecture at the histological level, which separates groups of productively infected CD 4 + cells. Nevertheless, current population models of HIV assume <b>panmixis</b> within lymphoid tissue. We present a simple “metapopulation” model of HIV replication, where {{the population of}} infected cells is comprised {{of a large number}} of small populations, each of which is established by a few founder viruses and undergoes turnover. To test this model, we analyzed viral genetic variation of infected cell subpopulations within the spleen and demonstrated the action of founder effects as well as significant variation in the extent of genetic differentiation between subpopulations among patients. The combination of founder effects and subpopulation turnover can result in an effective population size much lower than the actual population size and may contribute to the importance of genetic drift in HIV evolution despite a large number of infected cells...|$|E
40|$|Inseminative {{ability in}} Pteromalus venusus, an arrhenotokous {{parasitoid}} presumed to have evolved under Local Mate Competition, was studied by recording the progeny {{production of a}} series of six virgin females presented to males at hourly intervals. Most males did not reach the upper limits of their inseminative abilities: Three-quarters of the males inseminated at least four females, twice the ratio of females-to-males in an average brood (2 : 1). There was no evidence of sperm depletion: The few uninseminated females did not tend to be those presented later in the mating sequence, and a comparison of progeny production by female position in the mating sequence showed no tendency for females presented later to produce fewer females than those presented earlier. The data suggest that males can inseminate at least twice the number of females that normally share a host with them.

40|$|Koinophilia, the {{avoidance}} of sexual mates bearing strange phenotypic features, or displaying odd behaviour, would, if it evolved, profoundly influence the evolutionary process. A stochastic computer model was therefore devised to investigate the evolution of an initially rare koinophilic trait in panmictic populations, subject to mutations with randomly varying fitnesses. Individual genomes consisted of 50 genes. Mutations occurred {{at a rate of}} 0. 005, 0. 01 or 0. 02 per gene per generation. The mean and maximum fitness of mutations could be varied, as could the proportion of beneficial mutations. The carriers of the koinophilic trait avoided, with adjustable degrees of intensity, mates displaying unusual phenotypic features (traits with population frequencies < 0. 5); panmictic individuals mated randomly. The results show that koinophilia tends to replace <b>panmixis</b> whenever the preference for common phenotypic traits is strongly expressed, when few mutations are beneficial (1 % instead of 10 %), or when the maximum fitness of mutations is low (1. 2 instead of 2. 0). The mutation rate and mean fitness of mutations had only minor effects on the relative advantage of koinophilia. Articl...|$|E

First, we discuss how models of evolution can accommodate change to better reflect the dynamics of sequence diversity, particularly when it is becoming {{a lot easier to}} obtain sequences at different times and across intervals where the probability of new mutations contributing to this diversity is high. Second, we describe our work on the use of a single locus for species delimitation; this research targets the new DNA-barcoding approach that aims to catalogue the entirety of life.

40|$|The {{honeybee}} (Apis mellifera) queen mates during nuptial flights, in {{the so-called}} drone congregation area where many males from surrounding colonies gather. Using 20 highly polymorphic microsatellite loci, we studied a sample of 142 drones captured in a congregation close to Oberursel (Germany). A parentage test based on lod score showed that this sample contained one group of four brothers, six groups of three brothers, 20 groups of two brothers and 80 singletons. These values {{are very close to}} a Poisson distribution. Therefore, colonies were apparently equally represented in the drone congregation, and calculations showed that the congregation comprised males that originated from about 240 different colonies. This figure is surprisingly high. Considering the density of colonies around the congregation area and the average flight range of males, it suggests that most colonies within the recruitment perimeter delegated drones to the congregation with an equal probability, resulting in an almost perfect <b>panmixis.</b> Consequently, the relatedness between a queen and her mates, and hence the inbreeding coefficient of the progeny, should be minimized. The relatedness among the drones mated to the same queen is also very low, maximizing the genetic diversity among the different patrilines of a colony...|$|E
40|$|When a {{mutation}} with {{selective advantage}} s spreads through a panmictic population, it may cause two lineages at a linked locus to coalesce; {{the probability of}} coalescence is exp (- 2. r T), where T ~ log (2. N s) / s {{is the time to}} fixation, N is the number of haploid individuals, and r is the recombination rate. Population structure delays fixation, and so weakens the effect of a selective sweep. However, favourable alleles spread through a spatially continuous population behind a narrow wavefront; ancestral lineages are confined at the tip of this front, and so coalesce rapidly. In extremely dense populations, coalescence is dominated by rare fluctuations ahead of the front. However, we show that for moderate densities, a simple quasi-deterministic approximation applies: the rate of coalescence within the front is λ ~ 2. g (η) / (ρℓ), where ρ is the population density and ℓ=σ 2 /s is the characteristic scale of the wavefront; g (η) depends only on the strength of random drift, η=ρσs/ 2. The net effect of a sweep on coalescence also depends crucially on whether two lineages are ever both within the wavefront at the same time: even in the extreme case when coalescence within the front is instantaneous, the net rate of coalescence may be lower than in a single panmictic population. Sweeps can also have a substantial impact on the rate of gene flow. A single lineage will jump to a new location when it is hit by a sweep, with mean square displacement σeff 2 /σ 2 =(8 / 3) (L/ℓ) (Λ/R); this can be substantial if the species' range, L, is large, even if the species-wide rate of sweeps per map length, Λ / R, is small. This effect is half as strong in two dimensions. In contrast, the rate of coalescence between lineages, at random locations in space and on the genetic map, is proportional to (c / L) (Λ / R), where c is the wavespeed: thus, on average, one-dimensional structure is likely to reduce coalescence due to sweeps, relative to <b>panmixis.</b> In two dimensions, genes must move along the front before they can coalesce; this process is rapid, being dominated by rare fluctuations. This leads to a dramatically higher rate of coalescence within the wavefront than if lineages simply diffused along the front. Nevertheless, the net rate of coalescence due to a sweep through a two-dimensional population is likely to be lower than it would be with <b>panmixis.</b> © 2012 Elsevier Inc...|$|E

Beetles now resident in Australia were of a different African origin than were beetles in North America. North American beetles did not show covariance between two mitochondrial haplotypes and their microsatellite frequencies, suggesting that these beetles have a shared source despite having initial genetic structure within their introduced range.

40|$|Geneticists {{seeking to}} {{understand}} HIV- 1 evolution among human hosts generally assume that hosts represent a panmictic population. Social science research {{demonstrates that the}} network patterns over which HIV- 1 spreads are highly nonrandom, but {{the effect of these}} patterns on the genetic diversity of HIV- 1 and other sexually transmitted pathogens has yet to be thoroughly examined. In addition, interhost phylogenetic models rarely account explicitly for genetic diversity arising from intrahost dynamics. This study outlines a graph-theoretic framework (exponential random graph modeling, ERGM) for the estimation, inference, and simulation of dynamic partnership networks. This approach is used to simulate HIV- 1 transmission and evolution under eight mixing patterns resembling those observed in empirical human populations, while simultaneously incorporating intrahost viral diversity. Models of parametric growth fit panmictic populations well, yielding estimates of total viral effective population on the order of the product of infected host size and intrahost effective viral population size. Populations exhibiting patterns of nonrandom mixing differ more widely in estimates of effective population size they yield, however, and reconstructions of population dynamics can exhibit severe errors if <b>panmixis</b> is assumed. I discuss implications for HIV- 1 phylogenetics and the potential for ERGM to provide a general framework for addressing these issues...|$|E

Fragments of env, gag, and pol genes of 55 HIV-infected Surinamese, Antillean, and Dutch heterosexuals living in The Netherlands and 72 HIV-infected heterosexuals living in Suriname and the Antilles were amplified and sequenced. We included 145 pol sequences of HIV-infected Surinamese, Antillean, and Dutch heterosexuals living in The Netherlands from an observational cohort. All sequences were phylogenetically analyzed by neighbor-joining. Additionally, HIV- 1 mobility among ethnic groups was estimated. A phylogenetic tree of all pol sequences showed two Surinamese and three Antillean clusters of related strains, but no clustering between ethnic groups. Clusters included sequences of individuals living in Suriname and the Antilles {{as well as}} those who have migrated to The Netherlands. Similar clustering patterns were observed in env and gag. Analysis of HIV mobility among ethnic groups showed significantly lower migration between groups than expected under the hypothesis of <b>panmixis,</b> apart from higher HIV migration between Antilleans in The Netherlands and all other groups.

40|$|On {{the island}} of Schiermonnikoog (The Netherlands), the {{breeding}} population of oystercatchers {{can be divided into}} two groups: ‘residents’ and ‘leapfrogs’, based on their distinct social characteristics and limited probabilities of status change between breeding seasons. In order to investigate whether this social organization has caused local genetic differentiation, leapfrogs and residents were compared at eight polymorphic microsatellite loci. No significant genetic subdivision between residents and leapfrogs was observed (Θ = 0. 0000; 95 % confidence interval (CI), – 0. 0027 – 0. 0033), indicating that the oystercatcher population on {{the island of}} Schiermonnikoog has to be considered as one panmictic unit. Investigation of three additional locations {{in the northern part of}} The Netherlands did not reveal significant genetic population subdivision either (Θ = – 0. 0005; 95 % CI, – 0. 0045 – 0. 0037), despite the fact that adult oystercatchers show extreme fidelity to their breeding localities. These results indicate <b>panmixis</b> and considerable levels of gene flow within the northern part of The Netherlands. Thus, the results from genetical analyses do not seem to be in agreement with observational data on the dispersal behaviour of breeding individuals. It is argued that the lack of population structure, locally on Schiermonnikoog as well as across larger geographical distances, is to be attributed to high levels of gene flow through dispersal of juvenile birds. ...|$|E
40|$|The common {{ancestor}} of the self-fertilizing nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae must have reproduced by obligate outcrossing, like most species in this genus. However, {{we have only}} a limited understanding about how genetic variation is patterned in such male–female (gonochoristic) Caenorhabditis species. Here, we report results from surveying nucleotide variation of six nuclear loci in a broad geographic sample of wild isolates of the gonochoristic C. remanei. We find high levels of diversity in this species, with silent-site diversity averaging 4. 7 %, implying an effective population size close to 1 million. Additionally, the pattern of polymorphisms reveals little evidence for population structure or deviation from neutral expectations, suggesting that the sampled C. remanei populations approximate <b>panmixis</b> and demographic equilibrium. Combined with the observation that linkage disequilibrium between pairs of polymorphic sites decays rapidly with distance, this suggests that C. remanei will provide an excellent system for identifying the genetic targets of natural selection from deviant patterns of polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium. The patterns revealed in this obligately outcrossing species may provide a useful model of the evolutionary circumstances in C. elegans' gonochoristic progenitor. This will be especially important if self-fertilization evolved recently in C. elegans history, {{because most of the}} evolutionary time separating C. elegans from its known relatives would have occurred in a state of obligate outcrossing...|$|E
40|$|Sclerotinia trifoliorum Erikks. is an ascomycete fungus {{that causes}} rot in red clover crops, a disease {{difficult}} to control as no completely resistant red clover varieties are available. Breeding programs aimed at improving the resistance of red clover varieties are hindered by insufficient knowledge about the genetic diversity of S. trifoliorum in Europe. Therefore, the genetic diversity among 192 Sclerotinia isolates from red clover crops from 12 European countries was investigated using mycelial compatibility grouping and AFLP analysis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that two Sclerotinia species are present on red clover: S. trifoliorum in most locations and S. sclerotiorum in 2 out of 25 locations. Species identification was confirmed using a test based on the beta-tubulin gene we constructed. No subpopulations within the S. trifoliorum species were found, nor correlation between genetic and geographical distance. Most of the total variation (79. 2 %) was detected within S. trifoliorum populations, whereas a lower variation (20. 8 %) occurred among populations. The average F-ST value was 0. 208, indicating that S. trifoliorum isolates from red clover {{should be regarded as}} one population close to <b>panmixis</b> with a very low degree of population differentiation.

However, although this implies dispersal and growth across diverse environmental conditions, how locally successful populations assemble from a possibly global gene pool, relatively unhindered by geographic boundaries, remains poorly understood. Here, we show that environmental Vibrio cholerae possesses two, largely distinct gene pools: one is vertically inherited and globally well mixed, {{and the other is}} local and rapidly transferred across species boundaries to generate an endemic population structure. While phylogeographic analysis of isolates collected from Bangladesh and the U. S. east coast suggested strong <b>panmixis</b> for protein-coding genes, there was geographic structure in integrons, which are the only genomic islands present in all strains of V.  cholerae (Chun J, et al., Proc.

Despite {{the importance of these}} epidemics, {{little is known about the}} rates or determinants of viral spread among island and mainland populations or their directions of movement. We employed a Bayesian coalescent approach to investigate the transmission histories of DENV- 2 and DENV- 4 since their introduction in 1981 and a parsimony method to assess patterns of strain migration. For both viruses there was an initial invasion phase characterized by an exponential increase in the number of DENV lineages, after which levels of genetic diversity remained constant despite reported fluctuations in DENV- 2 and DENV- 4 activity. Strikingly, viral lineage numbers increased far more rapidly for DENV- 4 than DENV- 2, indicative of a more rapid rate of exponential population growth in DENV- 4 or a higher rate of geographic dispersal, allowing this virus to move more effectively among localities. We propose that these contrasting dynamics may reflect underlying differences in patterns of host immunity.

This chronic disease is characterized by a focal and complex epidemiology, which is still not fully understood. The use of molecular data provides insights into the distribution of parasite genotypes among hosts and is therefore essential to understand disease epidemiology. We therefore assessed the genetic diversity within and between natural S. mansoni populations in Northern Senegal. More than 1000 parasite stages (miracidia, cercariae and eggs) were collected from snails and human faeces within the villages Pakh, Diokhor and Thiekene. Individual samples were genotyped using nine multiplexed microsatellite loci. F-statistics revealed a random parasite distribution (<b>panmixis)</b> when individuals were used to define subpopulations. In addition, we found significantly lower allelic richness and lower expected heterozygosity for parasite populations within children than those within adults. These results confirm the idea that human hosts function as ‘genetic mixing bowls’, accumulating parasite strains during their lives. Parasite populations within adults are therefore more heterogenous than those within children. Interestingly, cluster analysis revealed a marked genetic differentiation between clusters without any prior boundary definition. Although the exact determinants of these clusters remain to be elucidated, it could be correlated with the number and spatial connectivity of the various parasite transmission foci.

40|$|We present {{evidence}} for {{a decline in the}} population of the American eel (Anguilla rostrata) from several widely distributed regions of North America from 1984 to 1995. Trends in population indices from commercial catch data, upstream passage counts, and seine, trawl, and electrofishing surveys were analyzed and found to be either not significant or significantly negative. Explanations for this decline, whether natural or anthropogenic, are unknown, due to variation and incompleteness in abundance data, and incomplete knowledge of eel life history, ecology, and population dynamics. A number of potential factors may be contributing to the decline, including (in alphabetical order) : barriers to migration, habitat loss and alteration, hydro turbine mortality, oceanic conditions, over-fishing, parasitism, and pollution. The paucity of life table data associated with the unconventional life history characteristics of anguillid eels (catadromy, <b>panmixis,</b> semelparity, high age at maturity, wide geographic distribution, and ecological generalist habit) prevents development of accurate population models and determination of overall effects influencing production and recruitment for this species. Historically there has been little attention to management of this species. A new coast-wide management initiative by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission has taken a conservative approach to limiting controllable and anthropogenic sources of mortality and enhancing recruitment and restoration of available habitat.

40|$|We {{developed}} population genetic {{theory for}} organelle genes, using an infinite alleles model appropriate for molecular genetic data, and considering {{the effects of}} mutation and random drift on the frequencies of selectively neutral alleles. The effects of maternal inheritance and vegetative segregation of organelle genes are dealt with by defining new effective gene numbers, and substituting these for 2 Ne in classical theory of nuclear genes for diploid organisms. We define three different effective gene numbers. The most general is Nλ, defined {{as a function of}} population size, number of organelle genomes per cell, and proportions of genes contributed by male and female gametes to the zygote. In many organisms, vegetative segregation of organelle genomes and intracellular random drift of organelle gene frequencies combine to produce a predominance of homoplasmic cells within individuals in the population. Then, the effective number of organelle genes is Neo, a simple function of the numbers of males and females and of the maternal and paternal contributions to the zygote. Finally, when the paternal contribution is very small, N eo is closely approximated by the number of females, N f. Then if the sex ratio is 1, the mean time to fixation or loss of new mutations is approximately two times longer for nuclear genes than for organelle genes, and gene diversity is approximately four times greater. The difference between nuclear and organelle genes disappears or is reversed in animals in which males have large harems. The differences between nuclear and organelle gene behavior caused by maternal inheritance and vegetative segregation are generally small and may be overshadowed by differences in mutation rates to neutral alleles. For monoecious organisms, the effective number of organelle genes is approximately equal to the total population size N. We also show that a population can be effectively subdivided for organelle genes at migration rates which result in <b>panmixis</b> for nuclear genes, especially if males migrate more than females...|$|E
40|$|The neuston {{comprises}} {{a community}} of interacting species that drift at the water/atmosphere interface of the planet’s subtropical gyres and {{play an important role}} in open-ocean epipelagic food webs. The ecological base of the neuston community is an endosymbiosis involving cnidarian hosts (Porpitidae) and their dinoflagellate photosymbionts. Porpitids are preyed upon by a variety of predators, including two specialized gastropods (Janthinidae and Glaucinae). This prominent open-ocean community has been poorly studied, apart from its resident insect genus Halobates. Based on a global sampling of neuston conducted between 2005 - 2012, this research begins by focusing on the evolutionary history of neustonic taxa across three trophic levels (photosymbionts, porpitid hosts, predatory gastropods) and all 5 subtropical gyre systems. First, photosymbionts genotyped from exemplars of both porpitid genera are identified as the same genus, Scrippsiella (Peridiniales), in every ocean gyre. Second, a molecular phylogeny including bubble-rafting janthinids shows that they are nested within the benthic family Epitoniidae, or wentletrap snails. Using morphological and ecological data from epitoniids, the common violet snail genus Janthina, and the rare brown janthinid genus Recluzia, two hypotheses for the evolutionary origins of bubble floats are tested. The data support the evolution of the janthinid float from an epitoniid egg mass. Third, the differential distributions of the two species of glaucinin nudibranchs (Glaucus atlanticus, global; G. marginatus, Indo-Pacific) presented an opportunity to test whether the establishment of geographic vs. biological barriers is the primary speciation mechanism. Comparing genetic structuring between the two congeners shows that the global species, G. atlanticus, is panmictic whereas the Indo-Pacific G. marginatus is a complex of four overlapping cryptic species in two clades. A repeated reproductive change has occurred once in each clade: the loss of the bursa copulatrix, which is hypothesized to be a biological speciation mechanism in this clade. Finally, mitochondrial phylogeographies of three global neustonic taxa, Glaucus atlanticus (Glaucinae), Velella velella, and Porpita porpita (Porpitidae) are compared to test three hypotheses of within-species genetic structuring: global panmixis; ocean basin panmixis; within-gyre <b>panmixis.</b> The results show that ocean basin and ocean gyre boundaries vary by taxon as barriers to gene flow...|$|E

Across all populations a high level of population differentiation (Pst = 0, 3; (Nei’s) D = 0, 378 ± 0, 292) was measured. Clustering performed with UPGMA shows clearly differentiated metapopulations, but levels of differentiation did not correspond with geographic distance; metapopulations separated by less than 2 km were genetically more different than those 50 km apart. Within metapopulations, population differentiation was significant (p < 0. 01) at KR (Pst = 0, 03; D = 0, 025 ± 0, 022) and KS (Pst = 0, 03; D = 0, 018 ± 0, 020), but at Th effective <b>panmixis</b> was observed (Pst = 0, 02; D = 0, 004 ± 0, 006). Some effect of distance at the local scale was revealed only at KS. Mean temperature and depth (duration of hydrocycle) varied significantly (p < 0, 05) among sites with Th pools having significantly higher temperatures and shorter hydro periods than the others. Within metapopulations significant variation between pools was measured for mean depth (KS and Th) and conductivity (Th). There was no clear trend between gene frequencies and pool water parameters. It seems therefore unlikely that the genetic divergence measured between sites and among KH and KS pools results from differences in the selective environments. After correction for female length (ANCOVA), a significant (p < 0, 05) overall in situ differentiation in mean broodsize, egg diameter, and maturation rate was measured among metapopulations and local populations. Of all life history characteristics, only overall mean egg diameter was significantly (p < 0, 05) correlated with some of the environmental variables (pH and depth). In individual metapopulations significant differentiation (p < 0, 05) between pools was revealed for broodsize at KS and KH, but not at Th, while egg size varied significantly among pools at each site. No constant patterns of correlation between environmental variables and life history characteristics were revealed at the individual sites. Significant differentiation in allozyme frequencies between metapopulations and between populations at two sites and the absence of a clear association between environmental variables and allozyme and life history variation, point at tbe importance of stochastic processes in shaping the spatial genetic structure of B. wolfi. Additional 'common garden' experiments are required to reveal a possible genetic basis of the measured geographic variation in life history characteristics. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the potential for seed production, ex situ, {{from a range of}} forbs that were component species of grasslands and other grass-dominated plant communities in south-eastern Australia. Thirty-five species of native perennial forbs were collected from remnant grass-dominated plant communities in southern and western Victoria. All but one species (Tricoryne elatior, which did not germinate) were amenable to propagation and production in bark-based soil-less growing media in a variety of containers. Of 34 species, 29 (85 %) flowered and produced seed within one year of propagation, and all species flowered and produced seed within 3 years. Of 20 species planted into field beds in autumn, 15 established successfully. The species generally were not amenable to spring planting in field beds. There was large variation between species in seed production potential due to differences in the number of flowers produced and the number of seeds produced per flower. Seasonal environmental effects on plant development and seed production were investigated in two studies. Firstly, Bulbine bulbosa and Craspedia variabilis were sown outdoors, in containers, at 12 sequential monthly intervals from 2 / 4 / 95 to 10 / 3 / 96. Both species established from all sowings but most flower and seed production occurred during spring and early summer, regardless of sowing date. For C. variabilis, sowings in January and February produced the most inflorescences per plant in the following spring. B. bulbosa plants produced visible buds approximately one month later than C. variabilis and were harvested 3 months later than equivalent sowings of C. variabilis. The second {{study investigated}} the potential for scheduling `out-of-season' production of seed. Seventeen species (that would normally be propagated in autumn) were sown in a greenhouse, and grown outdoors, on three occasions in late winter and spring (6 / 8 / 95, 3 / 9 / 95 and 1 / 10 / 95). Some plants of all but one species (Eryngium ovinum) flowered by April 1996, with 5 species exhibiting complete flowering in one or more sowings (Brachyscome dentata, Leptorhynchos tenuifolius, Velleia paradoxa, Wahlenbergia luteola, and W. stricto). Most species appeared to flower in response to interactions between cool (10 C) temperatures and to changes in photoperiod. It was concluded that to ensure synchronous flowering and, therefore, the potential for <b>panmixis</b> in out-breeding species, most species should be scheduled for flowering in their 'natural' flowering season. A method for improving the harvest efficiency of Bulbine bulbosa was investigated to replace the need for hand-harvesting of individual capsules. The yield, size and germination capacity of seed harvested from inflorescences that had been detached from the parent plant at a range of maturities, and dried at 20 degrees C, were compared to those of seed harvested from intact inflorescences. Seed yield was highest from intact inflorescences but daily harvests were required and harvests spanned a mean of 33 days per inflorescence, double the time needed for detached inflorescences to release all their seed. There {{was no significant difference between}} harvest methods in the number of seeds harvested per capsule, but there was a higher proportion of large seeds harvested from intact inflorescences. Germination was greater than 70 % for all harvest treatments after 8 months of dry storage. Harvesting and drying inflorescences when one to three capsules had reached harvest maturity appeared to have the potential to increase harvest efficiency in B. bulbosa. The breeding system of Craspedia variabilis was examined in a greenhouse experiment that subjected inflorescences to one of three pollination treatments (none, hand self-pollination and hand cross-pollination). Cross-pollinated inflorescences produced an average of 301 achenes per capitulum, significantly more than either self-pollinated or non-pollinated inflorescences (19 and 15, respectively). It was concluded that C. variabilis is strongly out-breeding and largely self-incompatible. It was concluded that many perennial forb species were amenable to growth in containers but that seed production potential varied between species. For the genetic diversity sampled from remnant populations to be represented in seed produced in cultivated plants, the seed production system must take full account of the breeding system requirements and seasonal influences on flowering and seed production, for each species.

40|$|RONO: 00 Many Kingdoms make up {{the three}} Domains of life but only two of these, the Viridiplantae and Metazoa, appear to merit the {{attention}} of conservation biologists. Given that the neglected Kingdoms, which can broadly be described as microbial, comprise by any measure (biomass or genetic diversity) the ?unseen majority? of life on earth [1], one might ask whether only the ?macrobes? {{are at risk of}} extinction or whether it is only organisms visible to the naked human eye that are worthy of conservation concern. In this letter, I aim to highlight that the perceived ubiquity and cosmopolitanism of microbes is misplaced and that some do face threats to their continued existence. These (mostly) cryptic organisms will pose new challenges for conservation biology, which are not easily accommodated within the existing structures of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD); hence my proposal for a formal Global Strategy for Microbial Conservation (GSMC). ?Macrobial? bias in conservation biology is evident from perusal of mainstream conservation journals, where only 2 % of papers relate to microbes, mostly as threats to larger organisms (notably amphibian chytridiomycosis), rather than the conservation of the threatened microbes themselves. Whereas prokaryotes barely figure in CBD documentation, Kingdom Fungi are mentioned in the updated Global Strategy for Plant Conservation: ?Parties may choose on a national basis to include other taxa, including algae, lichens and fungi? [2]. However, the implication of subordinate status for these organisms is clear. Given that fungi supply core ecosystem services, for example as the dominant decomposers of plant-derived lignocellulose, they are clearly of ecological importance. Thus, it is perplexing that such meagre attention and protection are afforded to them. The most over-used phrase in microbiology, ?everything is everywhere, the environment selects? [3], suggests that microbial populations do not exhibit any biogeographical structure. Thus, if all microbes are geographically ubiquitous, they are unlikely to be at risk of extinction. However, even the most mobile microbial propagules, dispersed in air, vary immensely in both mass (c. 10 ? 6 ? 10 ? 12 g) and tolerance of the stresses of the airborne environment, so it is inappropriate to generalise about dispersal patterns. Some microbes, for example bacteria inhabiting leaf surfaces [4], do indeed appear to be ubiquitous, but many others exhibit clear regional endemism and the absence of <b>panmixis</b> [5]. This is also clearly the case for many pathogens, which have (or had until humans transported them) well-defined biogeographical distributions. The ?game-changer? in microbiology has been the application of rRNA barcoding and use of operational taxonomic units as species proxies. For diversity assessment and taxon circumscription, this approach allows detection of uncultured and unseen microbes, as well as usefully circumventing the lack of consensus as to the nature of any meaningful species concept for Bacteria and Archaea. High-throughput sequencing of environmental samples is now cheap, revealing not only the existence of numerous undescribed taxa and widespread cryptic speciation, but also providing increasingly detailed maps of taxon distribution [6]. Having cast doubt on {{the first part of the}} clich?, to what extent does the ?environment select?? Notable among microbes with specific habitat requirements are the symbionts present on and inside all larger organisms, ranging from intracellular microsporidia to mycorrhizal fungi. For instance, a recently discovered anaerobic fungus, apparently specific to the hindgut of the critically endangered Somali wild ass [7], is at risk of extinction through habitat loss before it is even formally described. Equally, the loss of an obligately symbiotic microbe could increase the extinction risk of its larger host, as has been suggested for some orchids and their mycorrhizal partners [8]; in addition, changes in the microbial ecology of the mammalian digestive tract can impact on host fitness [9]. It could be argued that protecting the ecosystem will suffice to protect its microbes and this approach is clearly sensible when resources are scarce. However, many ecosystems are neglected in conservation strategies simply because of the absence of larger organisms, for instance desert soil crusts, glaciers or unusual geological formations. One particularly pressing example is Lake Vostok, 4 km beneath the Antarctic ice sheet, where a Russian drilling programme is within metres of the lake surface. The indigenous biota, currently unknown and possibly unique, is at risk of destruction by introduction of surface life-forms when or if the drilling resumes later this year [10]. Despite huge lacunae in knowledge of the distribution and abundance of microbial taxa, a GSMC should focus on the protection of such microbially dominated habitats. Foremost among these should be endangered soil habitats and soil types, where the most diverse microbial communities exist [11]. The thrust of activity in elevating the profile of microbial conservation via a GSMC must come from the microbiology community, but the support of the broader conservation community is also necessary for these efforts to flourish. Studies of threatened microbes need to be published in mainstream conservation journals to reach the desired audience. However, the methods used to assess their diversity or distribution are both unusual and, at present, not well established. Recognition of these facts by editors and reviewers of these journals and the appointment of microbial ecologists to their editorial boards would be great first steps. All conservation efforts are ultimately funded by the public and here some education is needed, not only to counteract negative perceptions (?bad bacteria? or ?poisonous fungi?), but also to highlight the beauty and biotechnological utility of microbes, as well as their fundamental importance to ecosystem function. As Tom Curtis [12] has stated: ?if the last blue whale choked to death on the last panda, it would be disastrous but not the end of the world. But if we accidentally poisoned the last two species of ammonia-oxidizers, that would be another matter. It could be happening now and we wouldn?t even know?. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of dispersal in regulating patterns of gene flow, there are still major gaps in {{our knowledge of the}} consequences of many dispersal strategies for the genetic structure of marine populations. Until recently, most of our knowledge was based on studies which had investigated sexually reproducing species with the potential for wide dispersal of planktonic larvae. Relatively few studies have concentrated on intertidal species which lack a clear means of dispersal. This study used ecological and genetic techniques to investigate the consequences of restricted dispersal for marine intertidal populations, and to provide an important comparison for two closely related co-occurring intertidal species with contrasting life histories. Importantly, this study also provides the first investigation of the genetic consequences of wide dispersal for an intertidal species over such a large area of the eastern Australian coastline. Additionally {{this is one of the}} first investigations of the consequences of restricted dispersal on natural populations along the east coast of Australia. The co-occurring intertidal starfish, Patiriella calcar and P. exigua occur along much of the southeastern coastline of Australia. Whilst the breeding system is far from fully described for either species, P. calcar is believed to have the potential for wide dispersal via a sexually produced planktonic larvae. In contrast, P. exigua lacks a dispersive phase, as juveniles develop directly on the rocky shore and are thought to remain within the parental habitat. P. exigua 2 ̆ 7 s breeding system is further complicated as it is a simultaneous and/or protandric hermaphrodite. Although the life history of P. calcar includes planktonic larvae, the broad geographic range over which sampling was conducted in this study (1, 800 km) provided the potential for genetic differentiation, as a consequence of linear dispersal along the coastline, and the complexity and unpredictability of the East Australian Current. Despite the potential for disjunct genetic patterns among local populations of P. calcar, there was remarkably little genetic differentiation among local populations of P. calcar (FST = 0. 008 ± 0. 001). Such homogeneity was indicative of strong gene flow over the 1, 800 km of this study, and it was estimated that approximately 31 genetically effective migrants are exchanged between populations each generation. Electrophoretic data also indicated that local populations of P. calcar are maintained by recruitment of outcrossed sexually produced offspring. Single-locus genotype frequencies at the five enzyme-encoding loci assayed in 26 local populations, closely matched expectations for Hardy-Weinberg equilibria. Like P. calcar, local populations of P. eXlgua are maintained by outcrossed sexual reproduction. Single-locus genotype frequencies of six enzyme-encoding loci within all 25 local populations of P. exigua were in close agreement with expectations for Hardy-Weinberg equilibria. In contrast, to the broad <b>panmixis</b> of P. calcar and as expected for a species lacking a dispersive phase, large genetic differences were found among populations of P. exigua some separated by as little as 5 km. Such genetic differentiation among populations resulted in an extremely high FST value of 0. 518 ± 0. 054 among 25 local populations over 1, 1 00 kn 1 of the southeast Australian coastline. A significant positive correlation existed between geographic and genetic distance and was indicative of isolation by distance such as that predicted by a stepping stone model, implying that local populations may be at, or near, equilibrium under their current regime of dispersal. For P. exigua, the absence of gametic phase disequilibrium and the uniformity of genetic diversity among local populations further suggests that these may be well established local populations which have not recently been subject to population bottlenecks or recent colonisation. Effectively closed populations such as those of P. exigua should be particularly susceptible to the effects of stochastic processes, variability in demographic parameters and changes in localised site-specific selection. However, the consistent pattern of polymorphism for alleles at the Mdh locus in a group of four local populations along the Victorian coastline, that are virtually fixed for alternate alleles in populations to the north and south, suggests that sporadic migration of individuals via rafting may have occurred among the northern and southern groups. Clearly, such stability results from the lack of genetic input from outside sources and the apparently large size of P. exigua local populations. However, localised site-specific selection for heterozygosity was put forward as a possible hypothesis to explain the unusual patterns of allelic variation at the normally monomorphic Mdh locus in four neighbouring populations on the Victorian coast. A set of breeding experiments were used to confirm the assumption of normal Mendelian inheritance at the Mdh and Gpi loci, as such an assumption is central to population genetic studies, especially in view of the unusual allelic patterns of variation at the Mdh locus. In contrast to the extreme genetic differentiation exhibited among populations of P. exiuga is evidence that local populations are randomly mating, panmictic units (sensu Wright 1943) (Fsp values ranged from 0 to 0. 020 within four local populations). Although individuals of P. exigua were not evenly distributed across the rocky shore, these aggregations were not family breeding groups, as all individuals were inferred to be the product of outcrossed sexual reproduction. The scale and extent of differentiation within populations will reflect the breeding system of the organism, the distance and frequency of migration within local populations and the frequency of recruitment from outside sources. These data imply that these four populations are apparently large, well established local populations which rarely receive successful immigration from outside sources, and that adults and juveniles freely mix and mate at random. A consequence of the seemingly large size of local populations, is that genetic drift is unlikely to be important unless Ne fluctuates significantly. The contrasting life histories of P. calcar and P. exigua, resulted in vastly different patterns of genetic differentiation. Despite the potential barriers to dispersal of P. calcar, high levels of gene flow occurred among long populations along the east coast of Australia. As expected for a species with severely restricted dispersal, there was little gene flow among P. exigua populations. However, unlike the typical situation expected for species with severely restricted dispersal, local populations of P. exigua are large panmictic breeding groups in which apparently highly mobile adults and juveniles provide for gene flow. Consequently, these populations may be somewhat buffered against the effects of drift through fluctuations in population size...|$|E
