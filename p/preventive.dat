5|$|After Adolf Hitler came {{to power}} in January 1933, Piłsudski is rumored to have {{proposed}} to France a <b>preventive</b> war against Germany. It has been argued that Piłsudski may have been sounding out France regarding possible joint military action against Germany. Lack of French interest may have been a reason why Poland signed the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of January 1934. Little evidence has, however, been found in French or Polish diplomatic archives that such a proposal for <b>preventive</b> war was ever actually advanced.|$|E

5|$|Another {{reason that}} was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited role by the {{judiciary}} was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding <b>preventive</b> detention issues. Persons who are potential threats to national security may act covertly, hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial. By its nature, however, <b>preventive</b> detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to national security from materializing. Jayakumar said that the court is ill-equipped {{to determine whether there}} are suspicious circumstances which justify pre-emptive action. Tham agrees with this view, but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power. He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar, since the court is only interested in whether there is a national security issue involved.|$|E

5|$|Article 20 {{provides}} {{protection from}} conviction for offences in certain respects, including the rights against {{ex post facto}} laws, double jeopardy and freedom from self-incrimination. Article 22 provides specific rights to arrested and detained persons, in particular the rights to be informed of the grounds of arrest, consult a lawyer of one's own choice, be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest, and the freedom not to be detained beyond that period without an order of the magistrate. The Constitution also authorizes the State to make laws providing for <b>preventive</b> detention, subject to certain other safeguards present in Article 22. The provisions pertaining to <b>preventive</b> detention were discussed with skepticism and misgivings by the Constituent Assembly, and were reluctantly approved after a few amendments in 1949. Article 22 provides that {{when a person is}} detained under any law of <b>preventive</b> detention, the State can detain such person without trial for only three months, and any detention for a longer period must be authorised by an Advisory Board. The person being detained also has the right to be informed about the grounds of detention, and be permitted to make a representation against it, at the earliest opportunity.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. <b>Preventive</b> care is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in developing countries, and {{it may be difficult to}} budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of <b>preventive</b> care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E

Franco], hem-fir [Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.; Abies sp. ], and sugar pine [Pinus lambertiana (Dougl.) ] in field trials over a 12 -month period. Strong solutions of most <b>preventives</b> provided good to excellent protection for 2 months. Efficacy decreased substantially after the studs were stored 6 months through warm weather. Hem-fir, {{and to a}} lesser degree, Douglas-fir, were adequately protected for 12 months only by Permatox 101. None of the treatments protected sugar pine for 1 year...|$|R

5|$|On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie {{underwent}} a <b>preventive</b> double mastectomy after learning {{she had an}} 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene. Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer. Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation. Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts. Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she {{underwent a}} <b>preventive</b> oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly.
