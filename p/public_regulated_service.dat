Possible antenna setups for a 3 D WFS laboratory environment are proposed. For these setups, the 3 D WFS accuracy is investigated for emulating different polarization types and multipath reflections with arbitrary source directions.

This paper {{starts with}} a brief {{discussion}} of the Galileo project status and {{with a description of}} the present Galileo architecture (space segment, ground segment, user segment). It focuses on explaining special features compared to the American GPS system. The presentation of the user segment comprises a discussion of the actual Galileo signal structure. The Galileo carrier frequency, modulation scheme and data rate of all 10 navigation signals are described as well as parameters of the search and rescue service. The navigation signals are used to realize three types of open services, the safety of life service, two types of commercial services and the <b>public</b> <b>regulated</b> <b>service.</b> The signal performance in terms of the pseudorange code error due to thermal noise and multipath is discussed as well as interference to and from other radionavigation services broadcasting in the E 5 and E 6 frequency band. The interoperability and compatibility of Galileo and GPS is realized by a properly chosen signal structures in E 5 a/L 5 and E 2 -L 1 -E 1 and compatible geodetic and time reference frames.

40|$|UNiversity of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2013. Major: Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics. Advisor: Demoz Gebre-Egziabher. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 105 pages, appendices A-D. A position authentication system utilizing the white noise like GPS spreading codes as tamper proof watermarks is developed. Position authentication as used here means {{the process of}} checking whether position reports made by a remote user are truthful and accurate. In the method proposed, {{a segment of the}} GPS signal collected by a trusted user (called the authenticator) is used as a template. Another user's (called the supplicant) GPS signal is compared with the template to judge if the user's position and time report is authentic. A pseudorandom noise sequence in the GPS signal (the P(Y) code) is used as a watermark in this process. An analysis to explain how noise affects the watermark signal detection is presented. This is done by casting the problem into a standard estimation and detection framework. A cross-correlator based watermark signal detector-estimator is constructed. This is different from the traditional match filter because the noisy template of the authenticator is used in this detector-estimator. The effect of the noisy template on the performance of the estimator is analyzed. An important practical implementation issue, namely, multiple false peaks caused by C/A power leakage which mask the detection of the watermark is analyzed. A method for suppressing these false peaks is developed. A pair of prototype receivers to validate this concept are constructed. Experimental results using these receivers show that the authentication method proposed can detect deceptive position report and the resolution of the position authentication is at or better than 15 meters. This method may also be used in other GNSS system, for example Galileo, by utilizing the encrypted <b>Public</b> <b>Regulated</b> <b>Service</b> signal as the watermark signal...|$|E
40|$|GNSS {{technology}} {{is used for}} many applications: The surveying industry uses GNSS for monitoring the continental drift, stakeout fixed-points, measuring maps of areas and many other location based services. The construction industry uses GNSS for machine control and logistics, agriculture for precise farming, power steering assists and other tasks like bringing out manure, harvesting and plowing. Over the last 10 years GNSS has also entered many daily life applications like car navigation and location based services (Google Maps, Facebook). But GNSS is also used as a sensor for many safety-critical applications: the example of guided lading approach of airplanes is well known,but it is less known that GNSS 9 ̆ 6 and here specifially the Open Service of the US NAVSTAR GPS 9 ̆ 6 {{is used as a}} crucial sensor for timing and synchronization of reference stations for telecommunication, electrical power supplies, exchange markets and banks. For many years, the availability and faultless function of GNSS has been taken for granted. Jamming (intentional interference targeting the unavailability of the system) as well as spoofing (faking of a false position/time towards a target GNSS receiver) was no concern for nearly all users except the military. But recent events started a gradual paradigm shift: the unintentional jamming of Newark Airport, NY, USA by an UPS driver with a US 100 device available on eBay; the capturing of a US drone using a GPS spoofer by Iran; the demonstration of students from the University of Austin, Texas, US, to hijack a US 80 million dollar Yacht with a self-made spoofer as well as their laboratory demonstration to use this spoofer to tamper the phase measurement units used for energy network synchronization and control. In this paper we review these events and show how our currently used GNSS technology was attacked and affected. Then we discuss different measures to detect and even mitigate these threats on the algorithmic, receiver, antenna and system level. Finally, we conclude with providing solutions and recommendations for hardening and protecting GNSS receivers by e. g. using array antennas and/or services like the Galileo <b>Public</b> <b>Regulated</b> <b>Service</b> (PRS) with civilian anti-spoofing guaranteed by the strong encryption used there...|$|E

The topic gains increasing importance in the debate on current regulatory reforms. Regulatory risks may occur on different levels of regulatory activities. To analyze where possible indirect costs of risk and uncertainty could occur we investigate a case study in the UK postal market. In postal markets these types of costs occur mainly with regard to universal service obligations, licensing regimes, access regulation, price control, structural market entry barriers and adaptations of regulatory regimes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBecause of {{the limited}} {{availability}} of the spectrum allocated for navigation systems, the numerous navigation signals broadcast by Modernized GPS and Galileo system {{will have to be}} combined and employ bandwidth-efficient modulations. Indeed, the GPS modernization scheme entails the addition of the new military signal (M-code) to the established C/A and P(Y) codes at the same carrier frequency. One of the most important questions is how to combine this new signal with the legacy ones at the payload level, while maintaining good performance at reception. This problem also exists for Galileo since: - in the L 1 band, the Open Service (OS) signal (two channels) and the <b>Public</b> <b>Regulated</b> <b>Service</b> (PRS) signal must be transmitted on the same carrier. - in the E 6 band, the Commercial Service (CS) signal must be transmitted with the PRS signal. The Interplex modulation, a particular phase-shiftedkeyed/ phase modulation (PSK/PM), was chosen to transmit all these signals because it is a constant-envelope modulation, thereby allowing the use of saturated power amplifiers with limited signal distortion ([STF, 2002; Rajan and Irvine, 2005]). The main objective {{of this paper is to}} study the Interplex modulation, as it is used for the GPS and Galileo signals. In a first part we will present the Interplex modulation, its general formulation and its application for the multiplexing of three signals. Then, we will be interested in the application of this modulation to the GPS L 1 signals and the Galileo L 1 signals. We will give the general expression of the GPS L 1 Interplex signal and show the modification which must be made on the general expression of the Interplex modulation to apply it to the case of the combination of the C/A and P(Y) codes with the new M-code. With regards to the Galileo signals we will study two different cases. In the first case we will consider that the OS signal is a classical BOC(1, 1). In the second case we will make the study, assuming that the OS signal is the new signal called Composite Binary Coded Symbol (CBCS), recently published ([Hein et al., 2005]). To conclude, the theoretical formula of the power spectrum densities of the GPS L 1 Interplex signals and of the Galileo L 1 Interplex signal are given...|$|E
40|$|There {{is little}} doubt {{that one of the most}} {{interesting}} and revolutionary, but also complicated and challenging space projects of today is Galileo, Europe’s own full-fledged second-generation navigation satellite system. Developed jointly by the European Union through the Commission and the European Space Agency, Galileo should by the end of the decade have thirty operational satellites in middle-earth-orbits providing timing, positioning and navigation signals across the globe. From the very beginning Galileo was envisaged in particular by the Commission as a public-private-partnership (PPP). On the one hand, a private concessionaire should operate the system as of full operational capability (originally scheduled for 2008, but more likely to occur not until a few years thereafter) and provide, market and sell its services – the Open Service (OS), the Commercial Service (CS), the Safety-of-Life Service (SOL), the <b>Public</b> <b>Regulated</b> <b>Service</b> (PRS) and a contribution to existing Search-and-Rescue services (SAR). On the other hand, a public body should monitor all such activities and the evident public interests in them – keeping them safe, secure and in mankind’s interest in general. Such a public side to the PPP-equation was given its first embodiment with the creation of the Galileo Interim Support Structure (GISS) in 2001. The GISS was essentially a number of ESA officials being seconded under Commission funding (and control) to supervise and guide the various projects under the EU’s Fifth Framework Programme supporting the definition and development phase of Galileo. The major task of the GISS ended up to be dealing with the intricacies of what had become the GALILEI Study, a cluster of originally separate projects dealing with key Galileo issues. A next level of institutionalisation was achieved with the establishment of the Galileo Joint Undertaking (GJU), a unique daughter entity of ESA and the European Commission as the two principal international entities behind Galileo. 3 The GJU kick-started the next phase of Galileo by, most fundamentally, initiating and supervising the tendering process for the private Galileo operator, which was to lead to the signing of a concession contract by the end of 2005 or shortly thereafter. In addition, the GJU should prepare the introduction of Galileo more generally speaking, which included responsibility for the guidance of a number of Galileo-related research projects under the EU’s Sixth Framework Programme. Currently, the third stage of institutionalisation has been given effect by means of the creation – at least on paper – of the European GNSS Supervisory Authority (EGSA) in 2004. With the proper start of operations of EGSA, expected by mid- 2006 or shortly thereafter, the GJU will be dissolved. Contrary to EGSA, the GJU was from the beginning envisaged to be a temporary entity. The current article tries to provide a first, rather preliminary and provisional evaluation of what EGSA will be able to do, by way of supervision of the private operation of the Galileo system – and hence also what it will likely not be able to do...|$|E

40|$|Because {{ecosystems}} are complex, tradeoffs exist among supplies of multiple ecosystem services, especially between the provisioning and <b>regulating</b> <b>services.</b> In ecosystem processes, {{net primary production}} (NPP) is connected with many other processes such as respiration and evapotranspiration. As one key supporting service, NPP is also related to other provisioning and <b>regulating</b> <b>services.</b> This study introduces an analysis framework of ecosystem services tradeoffs {{from the perspective of}} varied share of NPP, in the alpine grassland ecosystem of Damxung County on the Tibetan plateau, China. Total NPP was divided into the share of NPP spent on supplying provisioning services and the share used in supporting <b>regulating</b> <b>services.</b> Tradeoffs between provisioning and <b>regulating</b> <b>services</b> were analyzed by quantifying the change of meat provisioning service and the remaining share of NPP used in other ways; the corresponding change in the share of NPP used to support <b>regulating</b> <b>services</b> was also analyzed and compared with other changes in <b>regulating</b> <b>services,</b> such as carbon sequestration and water conservation services. The results show, from 2000 to 2010, the meat provisioning service increased by 199 %, but this was at a cost of additional livestock feeding, which used more NPP of the alpine grassland ecosystem. As a result, by 2010 the remaining NPP used for supporting <b>regulating</b> <b>services</b> shrank to 77 % of the 2000 level, which was accompanied by a decrease in carbon sequestration and water conservation services by 90 % and 67 %, respectively.

40|$|Changes in the {{delivery}} of public services in the industrialised countries over the last forty years have profoundly changed the ways for delivering and thinking about welfare state provision. For some the shift from welfare state to regulatory state indicates that priority is being given to markets and market failure over traditional welfare concerns with redistribution. Such an analysis leads to concerns about a loss of democratic control. For others, the sharpening of public policy institutions and instruments associated with regulatory governance offers the opportunity to deliver public services in a manner which is both more transparent and more efficient, enhancing outcomes, but without deviating from traditional goals. Changes to provision and oversight of welfare state services in Ireland in the past thirty years have included a degree of fragmentation, but also some consolidation, particularly in the health area. The changes in delivery have sustained a long established pattern of providing services through distinct units, both public and private. The changes in regulatory apparatus are more distinctive.
