25|$|The {{changeover}} {{to selling}} of petrol by the litre {{rather than by}} the gallon took place after the Board was wound up. It was prompted by a technical shortcoming of <b>petrol</b> <b>pump</b> design: pumps (which were electro-mechanical) had been designed to be switchable between metric and imperial units, but had no provisions for prices above £1.999 per unit of fuel. Once the price of petrol rose above £1 per gallon, the industry requested that they be permitted to sell fuel by the litre rather than the gallon, enabling them to reduce the unit price by a factor of about 4.5 and so to extend the lives of existing pumps.|$|E
