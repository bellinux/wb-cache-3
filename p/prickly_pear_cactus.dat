5|$|While French {{innovations}} enriched {{the cuisine}} in many ways, not every innovation was favorable. Since the French {{introduction of the}} <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cactus</b> in the 18thcentury, the lifestyle of southern pastoralists became increasingly reliant on the plant to ensure food and water for their zebu as well as fruit and water for themselves {{during the dry season}} between July and December. However, in 1925, a French colonist wishing to eradicate the cactus on his property in the southwestern town of Toliara introduced the cochineal, an insect known to be a parasite of the plant. Within five years, nearly all the <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cactus</b> of southern Madagascar had been completely wiped out, sparking a massive famine from 1930–1931. Although these ethnic groups have since adapted in various ways, the famine period is commonly remembered as the time when their traditional lifestyle was ended by the arrival of foreigners on their land.|$|E

50|$|Longhorn cactus beetles feed on chollas and <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cacti,</b> and {{are known}} to feed on saguaro seedlings. Larvae bore into cactus roots and stems, {{sometimes}} killing more susceptible individuals. Adults also feed {{on the surface of}} cacti.|$|R

25|$|Plant {{communities}} {{range from}} low-elevation grasslands and ponderosa pine forest to alpine meadows. Engelmann spruce, mountain hemlock, subalpine fir and whitebark pine {{can be found}} in the higher elevations, with Douglas-fir, white fir, western larch, and lodgepole pine elsewhere. Wildflowers include clarkia, Indian paintbrush, sego lily, elephanthead, larkspur, shooting star, and bluebell.

25|$|In general, most of {{the lower}} terrain in Calabria has been {{agricultural}} for centuries, and exhibits indigenous scrubland as well as introduced plants such as the <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cactus.</b> The lowest slopes are rich in vineyards and citrus fruit orchards.

25|$|Vegetation of the {{southwest}} generally includes various types of yucca, along with saguaro cactus, barrel cactus, <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cactus,</b> desert spoon, creosote bush, sagebrush, and greasewood. Although cacti is thought to only grow in Arizona and New Mexico, many native cacti grow throughout Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and west Texas.

50|$|Inks Lake State Park is a {{state park}} located in Burnet County, Texas, United States, next to Inks Lake on the Colorado River. The {{landscape}} of the park is hilly, with many cedar, live oak, <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cacti,</b> and yuccas. The ground is rocky, mainly consisting of gneiss rock.|$|R
50|$|Other {{animals that}} eat Opuntia include the <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> island snail and Cyclura rock iguanas. The fruit are relished by many arid land animals, chiefly birds, which thus help {{distribute}} the seeds. Opuntia pathogens include the sac fungus Colletotrichum coccodes and Sammons' Opuntia virus. The ant Crematogaster opuntiae and the spider Theridion opuntia are named {{because of their}} association with <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cacti.</b>|$|R
25|$|Pelee Island {{is reached}} by ferry from Leamington, Ontario or by plane or ferry in Sandusky, Ohio {{and is the}} largest of the Lake Erie islands. The island has a unique {{ecosystem}} with plants rarely found in Canada such as wild hyacinth, yellow horse gentian, and <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cactus.</b> There are two endangered snakes including the blue racer and the Lake Erie water snake. Songbirds migrate there in spring, and monarch butterflies stop over during the fall.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide variety}} {{of plants and animals}} {{can be found at the}} pishkun. Among the plant species which grow there are blue grama, bluebunch wheatgrass, needle-and-thread grass, and <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cactus.</b> Wildlife which can be seen there include American badgers, black-tailed prairie dogs, {{burrowing}} owls, coyotes, curlews, ferruginous hawks, golden eagles, gopher snakes, gray partridges, great horned owls, larks, mice, mountain cottontails, mule deer, pheasants, porcupines, pronghorns, raccoons, racer snakes, red-tailed hawks, Richardson's ground squirrels, sharp-tailed grouse, striped skunks, Swainson's hawks, western rattlesnakes, and yellow-bellied marmots.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} the park, and in turn also its flora and fauna, is largely typical for mountainous regions of the eastern Mid-Atlantic woodland, and indeed {{a large portion of}} common species are typical of {{ecosystems}} at lower altitudes as well. On southwestern faces of some of the southernmost hillsides pine predominates and there is also the occasional <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cactus,</b> which grows naturally. In contrast, some of the northeastern aspects are most likely to have small but dense stands of moisture loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance. Other commonly found plants include oak, hickory, chestnut, maple, tulip poplar, mountain laurel, milkweed, daisies, and many species of ferns. The once predominant American chestnut tree was effectively brought to extinction by a fungus known as the chestnut blight during the 1930s – though the tree continues to grow in the park, it does not reach maturity and dies back before it can reproduce. Various species of oaks superseded the chestnuts and became the dominant tree species. Gypsy moth infestations beginning in the early 1990s began to erode the dominance of the oak forests as the moths would primarily consume the leaves of oak trees. Though the Gypsy moths seem to have abated some, they continue to affect the forest and have destroyed almost 10 percent of the oak groves.|$|E
50|$|The {{habitats}} {{that are}} part of the park are pine flatwoods, scrubby flatwoods and the hardwood hammock surrounding South Creek. A variety of other plants exist within the park, like blueberry, persimmon, wild grape, cabbage palm, coontie, wax myrtle, <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cacti,</b> mangrove trees and giant leather ferns (Acrostichum danaeifolium).|$|R
50|$|M. gigas {{normally}} {{feeds on}} chollas and <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cacti,</b> {{and is known}} to feed on saguaro seedlings.

50|$|<b>Prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cacti</b> were {{introduced}} into Queensland, Australia as ornamental plants, starting in 1788. They quickly spread to cover over 25 million hectares of Australia by 1920, increasing by 1 million hectares per year. Digging, burning and crushing all proved ineffective. By 1914, two control agents {{were introduced}} to help control {{the spread of the}} plant, the cactus moth Cactoblastis cactorum, and the scale insect Dactylopius. By 1917, most areas of <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> had been destroyed.|$|R
500|$|The <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cactus</b> or raketa (...) , {{also known}} in {{southern}} Madagascar as sakafon-drano (...) or [...] "water food", was {{brought from the}} New World to the French settlement at Fort Dauphin in 1769 by Frenchman Count Dolisie de Maudave. The plant spread throughout {{the southern part of}} the island, where it became a fundamental food crop for Mahafaly and Bara pastoralists. Consuming six or so of the fruits of this plant preempted the need to drink water, and once the spines had been removed, the [...] of the plant would nourish and hydrate the zebu cattle they tended. The introduction of this plant enabled the southern pastoralists to become more sedentary and efficient herders, thus boosting population density and cattle count in the region.|$|E
500|$|The Metacomet Ridge hosts a {{combination}} of microclimates unusual to the region. Dry, hot upper ridges support oak savannas, often dominated by chestnut oak {{and a variety of}} understory grasses and ferns. Eastern red-cedar, a dry-loving species, clings to the barren edges of cliffs. Backslope plant communities tend to be similar to the adjacent upland plateaus and nearby Appalachians, containing species common to the northern hardwood and oak-hickory forest ecosystem types. Eastern hemlock crowds narrow ravines, blocking sunlight and creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in the region. Miles of high cliffs make ideal raptor habitat, and the Metacomet Ridge is a seasonal raptor migration corridor. Because the topography of the ridge offers such varied terrain, many species reach the northern or southern limit of their range on the Metacomet Ridge; others are considered rare nationally or globally. Examples of rare species that live on the ridge include the <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cactus,</b> peregrine falcon, northern copperhead, showy lady's slipper, yellow corydalis, ram's–head lady's slipper, basil mountain mint, and devil's bit lily.|$|E
