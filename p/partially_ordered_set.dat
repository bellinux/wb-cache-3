5|$|Another {{application}} of such chain conditions is in Noetherian induction—also known as well-founded induction—which is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently {{is used to}} reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that S is a <b>partially</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>set.</b> One way of proving a statement about the objects of S is to assume {{the existence of a}} counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of S contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the minimal counterexample. In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counterexample, there is a smaller counterexample.|$|E

25|$|An {{equivalent}} way of stating Dilworth's theorem is that, in any finite <b>partially</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>set,</b> {{the maximum}} number of elements in any antichain equals the minimum number of chains in any partition of the set into chains.

50|$|Two <b>partially</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>sets</b> {{are said}} to be order {{isomorphic}} when there exists an order isomorphism from one to the other. Identity functions, function inverses, and compositions of functions correspond, respectively, to the three defining characteristics of an equivalence relation: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. Therefore, order isomorphism is an equivalence relation. The class of <b>partially</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>sets</b> can be partitioned by it into equivalence classes, families of <b>partially</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>sets</b> that are all isomorphic to each other. These equivalence classes are called order types.|$|R
