Shanti Sena also sometimes act as liaisons to observers and law enforcement officers who patrol the Rainbow Gathering, often tracking the movements of police and park rangers through the gathering, and overseeing the interactions between officers and people attending the gathering to ensure that neither group instigates or takes part in illegal or inflammatory confrontations. This type of interference with police operations resulted in numerous arrests in the 1987 gathering in North Carolina, with state, federal and local officers being assaulted, blocked from patrol areas and threatened. The Shanti Sena at the '87 gathering were characterized by local, state, and federal officers as a criminal gang and were suspected to have collaborated in the assault on an Asheville Citizen-Times reporter. Several gathering members who reported they had been expelled from the gathering called the Shanti Sena [...] "gestapo" [...] and thugs. In some particularly serious situations, Shanti Sena have collaborated with law enforcement (although without violating the Gathering's <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>consensus).</b> For example, gathering regular and wanted murder suspect Joseph Geibel was peacefully approached by Shanti Sena and transferred to police custody at the 1998 gathering.|$|E

This review highlights some less studied areas that are of particular importance for landscape management, with special focus on rapidly growing exurban areas. While the visual quality of the environment is undoubtedly one of the drivers that has been spurring the exurban development of rural settlements, much remains unknown about the perception of the visual quality of these settlements. Another pressing issue is the need to determine general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> formation concerning visual landscape preferences.

There are several {{things that need}} to be reviewed in granting the right of recall to political parties: 1) there are no clear parameters (reasons and interests) implementation of the recall; 2) the mechanism of recall by the political party system paradigm indicates inconsistency with the sovereignty of the people that built through general elections; 3) granting the right of recall to a political party is not the principle of rule of law; 4) there is a judicial review about recall as evidence of disagreement with the recall provisions in Indonesia; 5) recall by political parties on the potential of tyranny and limiting functions of Parliament. Indonesia is not the state that has sovereignty from the people, but also embrace the democratic party in constitutional practice. Related with recall wholly given to political parties, based on the theory, the reality of law, and the state of society in Indonesia, it is not wise to erase the right of recall on political parties, but also be very discriminating when it does not involve the people in a term to control mechanism. Thus, the determination of holding such rights issues can be resolved if there is harmonization between them through participatory recall.

40|$|The small Himalayan and Buddhist {{kingdom of}} Bhutan {{is trying to}} unify its {{culturally}} pluralistic population to build a nation and national identity through a politics of cultural identity on the cultural basis of {{only one part of}} the population. As Bhutan is located in volatile South Asia, it will ensure its future independ-ence, sovereignty and security only if it manages to build a real, i. e. psychological, nation – which means to become a state all cultural groups can identify with. On the basis of Bloom’s social-psychological theory, this working paper (which is the short version of an MA thesis) shows that an integrative political system is a probable way to reach this aim, since it can make the Bhutanese state an identity-securing interpre-tive system for all its cultural groups. On the basis of Lijphart, it further shows that such a political system should incorporate at least the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> and special representation, and that the chances <b>of</b> a <b>consensus</b> model would be good in the case of Bhutan. Finally, the paper tries to show that the chances of probable and successful future democracy in Bhutan will not – somewhat contrary to Lijphart’s theory <b>of</b> majoritarian and <b>consensus</b> democracy – decrease if based on a two-party system instead of a multiparty system typical for the ideal type <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> democracy – as long as some crucial points are met...|$|R

Given the delicate balance of stability in Northeast Asia, Japanese leadership needs to use conflict management tools to resolve territorial claims with the governments of China, Russia, and South Korea. Given its desire to be a world leader, peaceful settlement of these disputes can enhance JapanÎ±s image in the world. Japanese leaders, in the pre-modern era, had adapted Confucian <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> building, order, and harmony to ensure peaceful coexistence. In an effort to be like the West in the late 19 th century, late Tokugawa and early Meiji leaders began to copy western ideas concerning {{what it meant to be}} a nation which included claiming territory and even going to war to maintain sovereignty interests. In the post-World War II era, Japan was able to return to a more Î²harmoniousÎ³ existence and by dealing with its territorial disputes through economic means.

40|$|Dense {{cooperative}} network involves {{communication and}} coding among multiple uncoordinated nodes. The distributed nature of cooperative networks results in both carrier frequency offset (CFO) and timing offset (TO) that degrade {{the performance of}} collaborative communication. Hence, network synchronization is mandatory to guarantee network operations. This paper proposes a novel method to perform joint time and frequency synchronization in presence of large TOs and CFOs by extending the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> method to synchronization. The estimation is based on assigning to all nodes the same training sequence based on Zadoff-Chu (ZC), that is arranged to decouple CFO from TO in symbol and frame synchronization. The synchronization is based on weighted consensus algorithm to reach synchronization in a connected network by using the superposition of the waveforms from all transmitting nodes as an ensemble of reference timing for synchronization. Time and frequency synchronization is guaranteed in multi-node interference scenario without the need to assign to every node an independent ZC sequence, and thus without any coordination. © 2014 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Knowledge {{of protein}} domain {{boundaries}} {{is critical for}} the characterisation and understanding of protein function. The ability to identify domains without {{the knowledge of the}} structure – by using sequence information only – is an essential step in many types of protein analyses. In this present study, we demonstrate that the performance of DomainDiscovery is improved significantly by including the inter-domain linker index value for domain identification from sequence-based information. Improved DomainDiscovery uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach and a unique training dataset built on the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> among experts in defining domains in protein structure. The SVM was trained using a PSSM (Position Specific Scoring Matrix), secondary structure, solvent accessibility information and inter-domain linker index to detect possible domain boundaries for a target sequence. Results Improved DomainDiscovery is compared with other methods by benchmarking against a structurally non-redundant dataset and also CASP 5 targets. Improved DomainDiscovery achieves 70 % accuracy for domain boundary identification in multi-domains proteins.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how children account for bullying when reporting experiences of and explanations for bullying. Previously, research on bullying has been predominantly quantitative based. This has only {{allowed for a}} unitary understanding of bullying which consists of defining bullying as a unified invariable behaviour. Qualitative studies on bullying have not gone much further, only examining what is done to bullying when attending to issues of accountability. An attempt {{has been made to}} understand how this is done, but not how this is done to perform a certain function within a particular context. Hence the present study will examine bullying as a discursively organised phenomenon constructed by and for children to examine these issues and demonstrate the social phenomenon of bullying. To do this, the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> discursive psychology are adopted which assume that talk performs a social function. There is a focus on the children‟s experiences and explanations given for bullying. We show how children view these reports as accountable, thus a deviation from normative expectations and thus require a justification. The analysis highlights how these reports work up credibility/facticity to achieve an overall construction of victim blame and derogation. Furthermore the analysis showed how bullying incidents were trivialised and lastly how the children explicitly denied any agency for their actions or appealed to the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>consensus</b> to speak for the rightness of the bullying. Given the pervasiveness of bullying in everyday life, we argue for the need to recognise it as a process not a mere product of society. Within this it is suggested that it would be beneficial to design bullying interventions which promoted and understood bullying as a normative, minimal practice not always an extraordinary practice, as the trivialisation of bullying showed. However above all it is suggested that discursive research can appreciate the disparity and perceptual differences in experiences which is invaluable in establishing individualised bullying interventions...|$|R
