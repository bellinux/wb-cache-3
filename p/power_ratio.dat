For example, the decibel is {{a unit of}} measurement associated with logarithmic-scale quantities. It {{is based on the}} common logarithm of ratios—10 times the common logarithm of a <b>power</b> <b>ratio</b> or 20 times the common logarithm of a voltage ratio. It is used to quantify the loss of voltage levels in transmitting electrical signals, to describe power levels of sounds in acoustics, and the absorbance of light in the fields of spectrometry and optics. The signal-to-noise ratio describing the amount of unwanted noise in relation to a (meaningful) signal is also measured in decibels. In a similar vein, the peak signal-to-noise ratio is commonly used to assess the quality of sound and image compression methods using the logarithm.|$|E

The proposed network structure consists of a set of λ/ 4 planar transmission lines at the design frequency and does not require any isolating resistor. The power divider is capable of providing various <b>power</b> <b>ratios</b> by judicious choice of the transmission lines characteristic impedances. Design equations are derived for arbitrary <b>power</b> <b>ratios.</b> Simulation results obtained from the ADS software proved the possibility of achieving preset <b>power</b> <b>ratios</b> with fairly linear phase response over a certain bandwidth.

METHODS: Percentage ionization curve was measured at SSD= 95 cm using 10 x 10 standard cone and 6, 8, 10, 12, 15 and 18 MeV electron energies. Stopping <b>power</b> <b>ratios</b> at each depth were determined as recommended by the three protocols. %DD curves were then found and compared.

40|$|We {{quantify}} the morphologies and dynamical states of 59 galaxy clusters using the power-ratio technique of Buote & Tsai applied to ROSAT PSPC X-ray images. The clusters exhibit a particularly strong $P_ 2 /P_ 0 - P_ 4 /P_ 0 $ correlation in the $ 1 h^{- 1 }_{ 80 }$ Mpc aperture {{which may be}} interpreted as an evolutionary track; {{the location of a}} cluster on the correlation line indicates the dynamical state of the cluster and the distribution of clusters along this track measures the rate of formation and evolution of clusters in our sample. The <b>power</b> <b>ratios</b> anti-correlate with the cooling-flow rate indicating a reasonable dependence of the flow rate on cluster morphology. The relationship of the <b>power</b> <b>ratios</b> to the optical Bautz-Morgan (BM) Type is more complex.

To date, the validation of this assessment tool has been limited to {{a small number of}} observers at a single site. No study has examined the intraobserver reproducibility and interobserver reliability of the <b>Powers</b> <b>ratio</b> measurement on plain radiographs or CT images among a large cohort of spine surgeons. This type of validation is critical to allow for the broader use of the <b>Powers</b> <b>ratio</b> methodology in research studies and clinical applications. Plain radiographs and spiral CT images of the cervical spine of 32 patients were assessed, and the <b>Powers</b> <b>ratio</b> was determined by five spine surgeons. Each surgeon performed three readings, 7  months apart. In the first round of measurements, the observers used only the Powers’ method of instruction. The second and third measurement sets were obtained after an interactive teaching session on the methodology. The order of the images was altered for the second and third set of measurements. The coefficient of variation (Cv) was calculated to determine the intraobserver repeatability and interobserver reliability for each imaging technique. A Bland-Altman plot was then used to assess the agreement between the two imaging techniques. For interobserver reliability, the mean Cv of the <b>Powers</b> <b>ratio</b> was 9. 09 and 4. 31 % for plain radiographs and CT, respectively. The Cv mean value for intraobserver reproducibility averaged 4. 95 % (range 1. 39 – 9. 08) when CT scans were used and 14. 17 % (range 7. 54 – 34. 30) when plain radiographs were used. For intraobserver reproducibility, the lowest and highest Cv mean value of five raters was 1. 39 and 9. 08 % using CT scans and 7. 54 and 34. 3 % using plain radiographs. The Bland-Altman plot, demonstrated that the two methods were in close agreement on the − 0. 8 and 0. 89 % interval for limits of agreement (bias ±  1. 96 σ). The intraobserver reproducibility and interobserver reliability of <b>Powers</b> <b>ratio</b> measurement was acceptable (< 5 %) with CT scans but not with plain radiographs. However, despite the statistically inferior reliability and repeatability, the Bland-Altman plot analysis showed that given the − 0. 8 and 0. 89 % limits of agreement, the two methods may be used interchangeably in clinical practice...|$|R
25|$|A power {{amplifier}} is an amplifier designed primarily {{to increase the}} power available to a load. In practice, amplifier power gain depends on the source and load impedances, {{as well as the}} inherent voltage and current gain. A radio frequency (RF) amplifier design typically optimizes impedances for power transfer, while audio and instrumentation amplifier designs normally optimize input and output impedance for least loading and highest signal integrity. An amplifier that is said to have a gain of 20dB might have a voltage gain of 20dB and an available power gain of much more than 20dB (<b>power</b> <b>ratio</b> of 100)—yet actually deliver a much lower power gain if, for example, the input is from a 600Ω microphone and the output connects to a 47kΩ input socket for a {{power amplifier}}. In general the power amplifier is the last 'amplifier' or actual circuit in a signal chain (the output stage) and is the amplifier stage that requires attention to power efficiency. Efficiency considerations lead to the various classes of power amplifier based on the biasing of the output transistors or tubes: see power amplifier classes below.|$|E

The effect of the condition of <b>power</b> contribution <b>ratio</b> on the normal stress applied onto the rack tooth was simulated using obtained relations. The optimum <b>power</b> contribution <b>ratio</b> of front pinion gear was defined as an effective designing parameter to reduce the stress applied onto the rack tooth.

It was found that most of traction force was sheared by the front pinion gear not depending on magnitude of traction force, because the revolutions of the front and rear pinion gears was directly constraint due to the link system of the connection in the gear box of current monorail. The optimum <b>power</b> contribution <b>ratio</b> was α= 0. 53 when the representative location of the contacting forces on front pinion gear was h 1 = 5. 6 mm measured from the root of tooth, and that on rear pinion gear was h 2 = 7. 0 mm, respectively.

40|$|We {{describe}} and test {{a method to}} quantitatively classify clusters of galaxies according to their projected morphologies. This method will be subsequently used to place constraints on cosmological parameters (Ω and the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations on scales at or slightly smaller than that of clusters) and to test theories of cluster formation. We specifically address structure that is easily discernible in projection and dynamically important to the cluster. The method {{is derived from the}} two-dimensional multipole expansion of the projected gravitational potential and yields dimensionless <b>power</b> <b>ratios</b> as morphological statistics. If the projected mass profile is used to characterize the cluster morphology, the <b>power</b> <b>ratios</b> are directly related to the cluster potential. However, since detailed mass profiles currently exist for only a few clusters, we use the X-ray [...] emitting gas as an alternative tracer of cluster morphology. In this case, the relation of the <b>power</b> <b>ratios</b> to the potential is qualitatively preserved. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method by analyzing simulated observations of simple models of X-ray clusters using the instrument parameters of the ROSAT PSPC. For illustrative purposes, we apply the method to ROSAT PSPC images of A 85, A 514, A 1750, and A 2029. These clusters, which differ substantially in their X-ray morphologies, are easily distinguished by their respective <b>power</b> <b>ratios.</b> We discuss the suitability of this method to address the connection between cluster morphology and cosmology and to assess whether an individual cluster is sufficiently relaxed for analysis of its intrinsic shape using hydrostatic methods.
