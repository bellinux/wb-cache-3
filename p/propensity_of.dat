Leighton suggested that Druitt {{could have been}} murdered, either out of greed by his elder brother William or, as previously suggested by Howells and Skinner, {{out of fear of}} exposure by Harry Wilson's homosexual cronies. The <b>propensity</b> <b>of</b> theorists to associate Ripper suspects with homosexuality has led scholars to assume that such notions are based on homophobia rather than evidence.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, {{variants}} that {{deviate from}} this template are known; what designates a Nazarov cyclization {{in particular is}} the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation. In order to achieve this transformation, the molecule {{must be in the}} s-trans/s-trans conformation, placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation. The <b>propensity</b> <b>of</b> the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with α-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain. Coordination of an electron donating α-substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation.|$|E
5|$|Given the <b>propensity</b> <b>of</b> the Macedonian {{aristocracy}} to assassination, {{foul play}} featured in multiple accounts of his death. Diodorus, Plutarch, Arrian and Justin all mentioned {{the theory that}} Alexander was poisoned. Justin stated that Alexander {{was the victim of}} a poisoning conspiracy, Plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication, while both Diodorus and Arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness. The accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating Antipater, recently removed as Macedonian viceroy, and at odds with Olympias, {{as the head of the}} alleged plot. Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence, and having seen the fate of Parmenion and Philotas, Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son Iollas, who was Alexander's wine-pourer. There was even a suggestion that Aristotle may have participated.|$|E
50|$|Kahan {{believes}} shaming penalties are on {{the rise}} in American law, and are an effective alternative to traditional punishments. This is especially feasible and valuable for federal white collar offenders. He develops a theoretical model that connects the deterrent efficacy of such penalties to their power to signal the undesirable <b>propensities</b> <b>of</b> wrongdoers and the desirable <b>propensities</b> <b>of</b> citizens who shun wrongdoers. He believes the efficiency of such penalties is affected by their power to express publicly valued social meanings.|$|R
40|$|The {{tendency}} of a polypeptide chain to form alpha-helical or beta-strand secondary structure depends upon local and nonlocal effects. Local effects reflect the intrinsic <b>propensities</b> <b>of</b> the amino acid residues for particular secondary structures, while nonlocal effects reflect the {{positioning of the}} individual residues {{in the context of}} the entire amino acid sequence. In particular, the periodicity of polar and nonpolar residues specifies whether a given sequence is consistent with amphiphilic alpha-helices or beta-strands. The importance <b>of</b> intrinsic <b>propensities</b> was compared to that of polar/nonpolar periodicity by a direct competition. Synthetic peptides were designed using residues with intrinsic propensities that favored one or the other type of secondary structure. The polar/nonpolar periodicities of the peptides were designed either to be consistent with the secondary structure favored by the intrinsic <b>propensities</b> <b>of</b> the component residues or in other cases to oppose these intrinsic <b>propensities.</b> Characterization <b>of</b> the synthetic peptides demonstrated that in all cases the observed secondary structure correlates with the periodicity of the peptide sequence [...] even when this secondary structure differs from that predicted from the intrinsic <b>propensities</b> <b>of</b> the component amino acids. The observed secondary structures are concentration dependent, indicating that oligomerization of the amphiphilic peptides is responsible for the observed secondary structures. Thus, for self-assembling oligomeric peptides, the polar/nonpolar periodicity can overwhelm the intrinsic <b>propensities</b> <b>of</b> the amino acid residues and serves as the major determinant of peptide secondary structure...|$|R
40|$|Monte Carlo {{simulated}} annealing {{is applied to}} the study <b>of</b> o-helix <b>propensities</b> <b>of</b> seven nonpolar amino acids, Ala, Leu, Met, Phe, Ile, Val, and Gly. Homopolymers of 10 amino acids are used and the propensity is calculated by folding cz-helicies from completely random initial conformations. The results suggest the large differences in propensities between helix former and breaker in agreement with the recent experiments with short peptides. It is argued that enthalpy difference for helix-coil transitions will {{play a major role in}} determining the helix propensity. The &strand <b>propensities</b> <b>of</b> the same homopolymers are also considered, and they are shown to agree with the frequencies of amino acids in P-strands. ...|$|R

The red-breasted nuthatch, Corsican nuthatch and Chinese nuthatch have breeding ranges separated by thousands of kilometres, but are similar in habitat preference, appearance and song. They were formerly considered to be one species, but are now normally split into three and comprise a superspecies along with the Krüper's and Algerian nuthatch. Unusually for nuthatches, all five species excavate their own nests.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, the Gibbs {{isotherm}} {{predicts that}} inorganic salts have negative surface concentrations. However, this view {{has been challenged}} extensively in recent years due {{to a combination of}} more precise interfacially sensitive experiments and theoretical models, both of which predict an increase in surface <b>propensity</b> <b>of</b> the halides with increasing size and polarizability. As such, surface tension is not a reliable method for determining the relative <b>propensity</b> <b>of</b> ions toward the air-water interface.|$|E

40|$|The helix {{propagation}} and N-cap <b>propensities</b> <b>of</b> {{the amino}} acids have been measured in alanine-based peptides in 40 volume percent trifluoroethanol (40 % TFE) {{to determine if}} this helix-stabilizing solvent uniformly affects all amino acids. The propensities in 40 % TFE are compared with revised values of the helix parameters of alanine-based peptides in water. Revision <b>of</b> the <b>propensities</b> in water {{is the result of}} redefining the capping statistical weights and evaluating the helix nucleation constant with N-capping explicitly included in the helix-coil model. The propagation <b>propensities</b> <b>of</b> all amino acids increase in 40 % TFE relative to water, but the increases are highly variable. In water, all beta-branched and beta-substituted amino acids are helix breakers. In 40 % TFE, the propagation <b>propensities</b> <b>of</b> the nonpolar amino acids increase greatly, leaving charged and neutral polar, beta-substituted amino acids as helix breakers. Glycine and proline are strong helix breakers in both solvents. Free energy differences for helix propagation (delta delta G) between alanine and other nonpolar amino acids are twice as large in water as predicted from side-chain conformational entropies, but delta delta G values in 40 % TFE are close to those predicted from side-chain entropies. This dependence of delta delta G on the solvent points to a specific role of water in determining the relative helix <b>propensities</b> <b>of</b> the nonpolar amino acids. The N-cap propensities converge toward a common value in 40 % TFE, suggesting that differential solvation by water contributes to the diversity of N-cap values shown by the amino acids...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{provides}} a new critical {{perspective on the}} <b>propensity</b> interpretation <b>of</b> fitness, by investigating {{its relationship to the}} <b>propensity</b> interpretation <b>of</b> probability.

Second, this interpretation of probability is inessential for explanations proposed by the <b>propensity</b> interpretation <b>of</b> fitness in evolutionary biology. Consequently, interpreting the probabilistic dimension of fitness in terms <b>of</b> <b>propensities</b> is neither a strong motivation in favor of this interpretation, nor a possible target for substantial criticism.

25|$|Because the {{structure}} of a protein is more conserved in evolution than its amino acid sequence, a protein sequence of interest (the target) can be modeled with reasonable accuracy on a very distantly related sequence of known structure (the template), provided that the relationship between target and template can be discerned through sequence alignment.
