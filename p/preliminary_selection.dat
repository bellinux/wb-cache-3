5|$|Koushun Takami {{completed}} Battle Royale when {{he stopped}} working as a journalist in 1996. The story was rejected {{in the final round}} of the 1997 , which took place in March 1998, because of its controversial content. Masao Higashi, {{who took part in the}} award's <b>preliminary</b> <b>selection</b> committee, later suspected this was due to its backdrop of students killing each other being too reminiscent of the Kobe child murders committed the previous year. Battle Royale was first published in April 1999 by Ohta Publishing. In August 2002, it was released in a revised, two-part pocket edition by Gentosha.|$|E

25|$|The Universidad de El Salvador (University of El Salvador) has {{a program}} of 8 years for {{students}} who want to study medicine. The first six years are organized in a two semesters fashion, the seventh year is used for a rotating internship through the mayor specialty areas in a 10-week periods fashion (psychiatry and public health share a period) and the eighth year is designated for Social service in locations approved by the Ministry of Health (usually as attending physician in Community Health Centers or non-profit organizations). The graduates receive the degree of MD and must register in the Public Health Superior Council(CSSP) to get the medical license and a registered national number {{that allows them to}} prescribe barbiturates and other controlled drugs. In order to attend further studies (Surgery, Internal medicine, G/OB, Pediatrics, Psychiatry), the students in the year of Social service or graduates of any Salvadorian university must apply independently for the residency to the hospital of choice; the <b>preliminary</b> <b>selection</b> process is {{based on the results of}} clinical knowledge tests, followed by psychiatric evaluations and interviews with the hospital medical and administrative staff. The basic residencies mentioned above commonly last 3 years; at the last trimester of the third year, the residents can apply to the position of Chief of residents (1 year) or follow further studies as resident (3 years) of a specialty (for example:orthopedic surgery, urology, neurology, endocrinology...). No further studies are offered to the date; therefore, specialist looking for training or practice in a specific area (For example: a neurosurgeon looking for specialty in endovascular neurosurgery, spine surgery or pediatric neurosurgery) must attend studies in other countries and apply for such positions independently.|$|E

500|$|Taylor {{arrived at}} the studio one day {{after a series of}} {{meetings}} began to select the musical pieces for The Concert Feature. Disney made story writers Joe Grant and Dick Huemer gather a <b>preliminary</b> <b>selection</b> of music and along with Stokowski, Taylor, and the heads of various departments, discussed their ideas. Each meeting was recorded verbatim by stenographers with participants being given a copy of the entire conversation for review. As selections were considered, a recording of the piece was located and played back at the next gathering. Disney did not contribute much to early discussions; he admitted that his knowledge of music was instinctive and untrained. In one meeting, he inquired about a piece [...] "on which we might build something of a prehistoric theme... with animals". The group was considering The Firebird by Igor Stravinsky, but Taylor noted that his [...] "Le Sacre du printemps would be something on that order", to which Disney replied upon hearing a recording, [...] "This is marvelous! It would be perfect for prehistoric animals. There would be something terrific in dinosaurs, flying lizards, and prehistoric monsters. There could be beauty in the settings." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, I {{will not}} {{pretend to be}} {{anything}} but a strong partizan in this matter. When I speak of [...] "democracy" [...] I mean [...] "selective democracy." [...] I believe that [...] "delegate democracy" [...] is already provably a failure in the world, and that the reason why to-day, after {{three and a half years}} of struggle, we are still fighting German autocracy and fighting with no certainty of absolute victory, is because the affairs of the three great Atlantic democracies have been largely in the hands not of selected men but of delegated men, men of intrigue and the party machine, of dodges rather than initiatives, second-rate men. When Lord Haldane, defending his party for certain insufficiencies in their preparation for the eventuality of the great war, pleaded that they had no [...] "mandate" [...] from the country to do anything of the sort, he did more than commit political suicide, he bore conclusive witness against the whole system which had made him what he was. Neither Britain nor France in this struggle has produced better statesmen nor better generals than the German autocracy. The British and French Foreign Offices are old monarchist organizations still. To this day the British and French politicians haggle and argue with the German ministers upon petty points and debating society advantages, smart and cunning, while the peoples perish. The one man who has risen to the greatness of this great occasion, the man who is, in default of any rival, rapidly becoming the leader of the world towards peace, is neither a delegate politician nor the choice of a monarch and his councillors. He is the one authoritative figure in these transactions whose mind has not been subdued either by long discipline in the party machine or by court intrigue, who has continued his education beyond those early twenties when the mind of the [...] "budding politician" [...] ceases to expand, who has thought, and thought things out, who is an educated man among dexterous under-educated specialists. By something very like a belated accident in the framing of the American constitution, the President of the United States is more in the nature of a selected man than any other conspicuous figure at the present time. He is specially elected by a special electoral college after an elaborate <b>preliminary</b> <b>selection</b> of candidates by the two great party machines. And be it remembered that Mr. Wilson is not the first great President the United States have had, he is one of a series of figures who tower over their European contemporaries. The United States have had many advantageous circumstances to thank for their present ascendancy in the world's affairs: isolation from militarist pressure for a century and a quarter, a vast virgin continent, plenty of land, freedom from centralization, freedom from titles and social vulgarities, common schools, a real democratic spirit in its people, and a great enthusiasm for universities; but no single advantage has been so great as this happy accident which has given it a specially selected man as its voice and figurehead in the world's affairs. In the average congressman, in the average senator, as Ostrogorski's great book so industriously demonstrated, the United States have no great occasion for pride. Neither the Senate nor the House of Representatives seem to rise above the level of the British Houses of Parliament, with a Government unable to control the rebel forces of Ulster, unable to promote or dismiss generals without an outcry, weakly amenable to the press, and terrifyingly incapable of great designs. It is to the United States of America we must look now if the world is to be made [...] "safe for democracy." [...] It is to the method of selection, as distinguished from delegation, that we must look if democracy is to be saved from itself.|$|E

40|$|It is {{very common}} in applied frequentist ("classical") {{statistics}} {{to carry out a}} preliminary statistical (i. e. data-based) model selection by, for example, using preliminary hypothesis tests or minimizing AIC. This is usually followed by the inference of interest, using the same data, {{based on the assumption that}} the selected model had been given to usâ€‚"a priori". This assumption is false and it can lead to an inaccurate and misleading inference. We consider the important case that the inference of interest is a confidence region. We review the literature that shows that the resulting confidence regions typically have very poor coverage properties. We also briefly review the closely related literature that describes the coverage properties of prediction intervals after <b>preliminary</b> statistical model <b>selection.</b> A possible motivation for <b>preliminary</b> statistical model <b>selection</b> is a wish to utilize uncertain prior information in the inference of interest. We review the literature in which the aim is to utilize uncertain prior information directly in the construction of confidence regions, without requiring the intermediate step of a <b>preliminary</b> statistical model <b>selection.</b> We also point out this aim as a future direction for research.

5000|$|In 1937, {{when the}} {{selection}} jury Hitler {{had chosen to}} put together the first Great German Art Exhibition to inaugurate the opening of the House of German Art in Munich outraged and angered the FÃ¼hrer with their choices, he dismissed the panel and put Hoffmann in charge. This dismayed the artistic community, who felt that Hoffmann was unqualified for the role. Frederic Spotts, in Hitler and the Aesthetics of Power, reports that Hoffmann was [...] "an alcoholic and cretin who know little more about painting than did the average plumber." [...] Hoffmann's answer to his critics was that he knew what Hitler wanted and what would appeal to him. Nevertheless, even some of Hoffmann's choices were dismissed from the exhibition by Hitler; a room full of somewhat more modern paintings which Hoffmann had selected as possibilities were angrily dismissed by Hitler with a gesture. Hoffmann remained in charge for subsequent annual Great German Art Exhibitions, making the <b>preliminary</b> <b>selections</b> which were then hung for Hitler to approve or veto. [...] Hoffmann preferred the conventional work of painters from southern Germany, what Propaganda Minister Josef Goebbels called in his diary [...] "Munich-school kitsch", over that of the more experimental painters from the north.|$|R
