50|$|Because the {{electron}} mobility {{is higher than}} the hole mobility for all semiconductor materials, a given bipolar n-p-n transistor tends to be swifter than an equivalent <b>p-n-p</b> transistor.

A relatively recent FET development, the high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT), has a heterostructure (junction between different semiconductor materials) of aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)-gallium arsenide (GaAs) which has twice {{the electron}} mobility of a GaAs-metal barrier junction. Because of their high speed and low noise, HEMTs are used in satellite receivers working at frequencies around 12 GHz. HEMTs based on gallium nitride and aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN/GaN HEMTs) provide a still higher electron mobility and are being developed for various applications.|$|E

40|$|We report {{distinctive}} magnetotransport {{properties of}} a graphene <b>p-n-p</b> junction prepared by controlled diffusion of metallic contacts.

The measured conductance-gate voltage (G-V_G) curves can be well described by a metal contact model, which confirms the charge density depinning due to the oxide layer. The graphene <b>p-n-p</b> junction samples exhibit pronounced quantum Hall effect, a well-defined transition point of the zeroth Landau level (LL), and scaling behavior.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel n-p-n BJT {{radiation}} detector on high-resistivity silicon with integrated <b>p-n-p</b> transistor providing the quiescent base current of the detector. The do operational {{limits of the}} proposed detector are analysed by means of numerical device simulations, pointing out that, by properly distancing {{the base of the}} <b>p-n-p</b> transistor from the emitter of the n-p-n detector, the latch-up of the parasitic thyristor embedded within the detector-plus-biasing-transistor structure takes place at relatively high current levels, where detector operation should anyway be avoided in order to prevent the associated current-gain loss. Numerical simulations provides insight about the bias dependence of charge-collection waveforms, indicating that minimization of the collecting time requires the detector quiescent current to be adjusted at the highest value still allowing high-injection effects to be avoided. A small-signal equivalent circuit of the proposed structure is also derived, allowing the impact of <b>p-n-p</b> biasing transistor and load resistance on the charge-collecting time constant to be evaluated. First experimental results show that fabricated structures are immune from the latch-up of the parasitic thyristor throughout their high-current-gain operating region and feature a minimum charge-collecting time constant of 35 mu s, as tested by pulsed laser illumination...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} {{fabrication}} and studies of transistor structures {{based on an}} atomic sheet of graphite, graphene, are described. Since graphene technology is in its early stages, the development and optimisation of the fabrication process are very important. In this work the impact of various fabrication conditions {{on the quality of}} graphene devices is investigated, in particular the effects on the carrier mobility of the details of the mechanical exfoliation procedure, such as environmental conditions and humidity, source of graphite and wafer cleaning procedure. In addition, a comparison is made between the conventional e-beam lithorgaphy and lithography-free fabrication of samples. It was also demonstrated that water and other environmental species {{play an important role in}} graphene-to-substrate adhesion and can also contribute to the carrier scattering in graphene. A technique for creating suspended metal gates was developed for the fabrication of graphene <b>p-n-p</b> structures, and charge transport has been studied in such top-gated graphene devices. Depending on the relation between the carrier mean free path and the length of the top-gate we have realized three distinct transport regimes through the <b>p-n-p</b> structure: a) diffusive across the structure; b) ballistic in the regions of p-n junctions but diffusive in the n-region; c) ballistic across the whole <b>p-n-p</b> structure. The second regime has revealed the chiral nature of carriers in graphene. This was demonstrated by comparing the experimental resistance of a single p-n junction with results of electrostatic modeling in the diffusive model. In the third regime we have observed oscillations of the device resistance as a function of carrier concentration in the n-region, which are also dependent on magnetic field. These oscillations have been demonstrated to be a direct consequence of a Fabri-Perot-like interference effect in the graphene <b>p-n-p</b> structures.
