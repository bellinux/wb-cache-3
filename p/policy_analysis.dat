5|$|Thus, {{engineer}} and physicist Hannes Alfvén identified two fundamental prerequisites for effective management of high-level radioactive waste: (1) stable geological formations, and (2) stable human institutions {{over hundreds of}} thousands of years. As Alfvén suggests, no known human civilization has ever endured for so long, and no geologic formation of adequate size for a permanent radioactive waste repository has yet been discovered that has been stable for so long a period. Nevertheless, avoiding confronting the risks associated with managing radioactive wastes may create countervailing risks of greater magnitude. Radioactive waste management is an example of <b>policy</b> <b>analysis</b> that requires special attention to ethical concerns, examined in the light of uncertainty and futurity: consideration of 'the impacts of practices and technologies on future generations'.|$|E

40|$|This paper address {{governance}} and decision-making in the European Union. It takes a multi-level governance perspective; that is, {{it assumes that}} governing authority is diffused across levels (supranational, national and subnational) within the European Union. Units within this emerging structure increasingly share resources, interests and influence over policy decisions. Similar to what Grodzins recognized in his "marble cake" conceptualization of the American federal system, the emerging decision-making structure in the EU is fragmented and characterized by "many overlapping governments (and I would argue non-governmental actors) involved in many overlapping functions" and by multiple points of access to decision-making processes (1966 : 25). <b>Policy</b> network <b>analysis</b> is a realistic tool for analyzing the complexity of interactions within the multi-level structure of this evidence. This study 1) establishes <b>policy</b> network <b>analysis</b> as a tool within the multi-level governance framework; 2) provides preliminary empirical evidence within the structure of <b>policy</b> network <b>analysis</b> through an investigation of environmental policy in Spain; and 3) discusses the theoretical implications of this evidence...|$|R
40|$|Since 1980 Technology Assessment (TA) {{has changed}} in nature from an {{analytical}} tool for technology evaluation, which depends heavily on quantitative and qualitative modeling methodologies, into a strategic planning tool for policy making concerning acceptable new technologies, which depends on participative <b>policy</b> problem <b>analysis</b> methodologies. The goal of TA today is to generate policy options for solutions of organizational and societal problems, which at the operational level utilize new technologies that are publicly acceptable; that is, viable policy options. After a review of some serious flaws in participative <b>policy</b> problem <b>analysis,</b> prototype modeling for computer simulation is advocated as an alternative methodology for complex <b>policy</b> problem <b>analysis.</b> This methodology {{has been applied to}} investigate the viability of the Dynamic Traffic Management technology called ramp metering as a policy option for reducing traffic congestion on the Dutch motorway system. For this virtual TA the prototype model has been specified as a System Dynamics model, which has been used in computer simulation experiments that produced positive results...|$|R
