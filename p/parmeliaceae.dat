5|$|Tree {{trunks and}} {{branches}} are ornamented with {{many species of}} ferns, Lycopodium, lichens, and orchids. Old man's beard (Usnea barbata) hanging from branches adds to {{the beauty of the}} forests. About 16 of the orchid species being endemic. Other notable plants include shrubs such as Rhodomyrtus tomentosa, Gaultheria fragrantissima, herbs, Exacum trinervium, E. walkeri, Drosera indica, and tree ferns Cyathea spp. Anzia, a foliose lichen genus belonging to <b>Parmeliaceae</b> family, which had not been recorded in Sri Lanka before, was discovered here in 2007. There are conflicting views on how the grasslands of the park came into being, whether man-made or natural. It is now believed that the grasslands on the dry slopes were created by forest clearance and fires while grasslands in low-lying areas were naturally created by wet conditions, frost and soil erosion.|$|E
25|$|Ascus {{evolution}} in Menegazzia {{is of particular}} interest, because many species have 2-spores per ascus, while all nearly other genera in the <b>Parmeliaceae</b> have 8-spores (making the character likely plesiomorphic for the family).|$|E
2500|$|Placement of Menegazzia {{within the}} <b>Parmeliaceae</b> {{has now been}} {{confirmed}} by several molecular studies. [...] However, the exact position of the genus within the <b>Parmeliaceae</b> remains uncertain. [...] It is unplaced within the <b>Parmeliaceae.</b> Previously, the morphologically similar genus Hypogymnia {{was thought to be}} the sister genus to Menegazzia, with some authors even separating these two genera into a family of their own, the Hypogymniaceae. [...] However, no molecular phylogenies to date have supported this grouping.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{attempted}} {{settlement of}} the islands occurred around 1438 by the Portuguese, although little details remain of this endeavour. The oldest extant description of the colonization was written around 1463 by the Portuguese mariner Diogo Gomes de Sintra. Gomes wrote that the islands were used to collect [...] "ursellam", {{as a base for}} red paint/dyes; [...] "ursellam" [...] referred to the lichens of the scientific families Roccellaceae and <b>Parmeliaceae.</b> In those days, the islands of the Atlantic (the Azores and Madeira) belonged to Henry the Navigator, the Grandmaster of the Order of Christ (the Portuguese successor to the Knights Templar in Portugal). However, the islands were generally omitted from the lists of their possessions.|$|E
50|$|The main photobiont genus that {{associates}} with <b>Parmeliaceae</b> species is the Chlorophyte Trebouxia. In particular the species Trebouxia jamesii {{appears to be}} especially prominent. Some <b>Parmeliaceae</b> genera are also known to associate with Asterochloris, but the frequence of this association is not yet known. In general photobiont diversity within the <b>Parmeliaceae</b> is a little studied subject, and much is left to discover here.|$|E
