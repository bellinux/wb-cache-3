25|$|In June 1979, a cover {{article in}} The New Republic {{attacked}} AFSC for abandoning {{the tradition of}} pacifism.

25|$|While she {{was writing}} popular novels, Eliza Haywood was also working on periodicals, essays and manuals on social {{behaviour}} (conduct books). The Female Spectator (4 volumes, 1744–46), a monthly periodical, was written in answer to the contemporary journal The Spectator by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele. In The Female Spectator, Haywood wrote in four personas (Mira, Euphrosine, Widow of Quality and The Female Spectator) and took positions on <b>public</b> <b>issues</b> such as marriage, children, reading, education and conduct. It was the first periodical written for women by a woman and arguably one of Haywood’s most significant contributions to women's writing. Haywood followed a lead by contemporary John Dunton who issued the Ladies' Mercury as a companion to his successful Athenian Mercury. Even though The Ladies' Mercury was a self-proclaimed women’s journal, it was produced by men (Spacks xii).|$|E

25|$|In Kansas around 1855, {{the slavery}} issue reached a {{condition}} of intolerable tension and violence. But this was {{in an area where}} an overwhelming proportion of settlers were merely land-hungry Westerners indifferent to the <b>public</b> <b>issues.</b> The majority of the inhabitants were not concerned with sectional tensions or the issue of slavery. Instead, the tension in Kansas began as a contention between rival claimants. During the first wave of settlement, no one held titles to the land, and settlers rushed to occupy newly open land fit for cultivation. While the tension and violence did emerge as a pattern pitting Yankee and Missourian settlers against each other, there is little evidence of any ideological divides on the questions of slavery. Instead, the Missouri claimants, thinking of Kansas as their own domain, regarded the Yankee squatters as invaders, while the Yankees accused the Missourians for grabbing the best land without honestly settling on it.|$|E
25|$|In the 1991 redistricting, {{the only}} change {{made to the}} district's {{boundary}} was the addition of Mount Holly. The district had been voting solidly Democratic until the anti-tax vote in 1991 brought in Republicans Bradford S. Smith in the Senate, who unseated Democratic incumbent Thomas P. Foy. In the Assembly race that year, Priscilla B. Anderson and Jose Sosa won the seats held by Jack Casey and Barbara Kalik. In the 1993 elections, the Republicans held on to their majorities {{in both houses of}} the legislature, but Democrats were able to retake the seats in the 7th District, with Jack Casey winning in the Senate and Steven M. Petrillo and George E. Williams in the Assembly. In the 1995 general election, Diane Allen and Republican running mate Carmine DeSopo were elected, defeating Democratic incumbent Steven M. Petrillo and his running mate, newcomer Joseph P. Dugan.
