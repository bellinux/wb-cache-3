50|$|During tests {{performed}} on frogs and mammals, {{it was found}} that the minimum <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> for an amphibian was 1/300th mg.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} using cat and guinea pig {{to investigate the}} influence of portal circulation on the <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> of g-strophanthin administered intravenously. The data indicated the following conclusions : When a part of liver is blockaded from the portal circulation, the intravenous <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> decreases markedly. And {{there seems to be}} a parallel correlation between the increase of the excluded portion of liver and decrease of <b>lethal</b> <b>dose.</b> It therefore, may be surmised that the <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> of g-strophanthin is considerably affected by the alteration of circulation in liver...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for Botrytis populations exposed to UV radiation to develop tolerance to the Trichodermametabolite 6 -pentyl-alpha-pyrone (6 -PAP) and the 6 -PAP analog massoialactone was determined using 14 different Botrytis isolates. There was significant isolate variation in germination of Botrytis conidia after UV exposure. Plating conidia onto sublethal doses of 6 -PAP yielded no 6 -PAP tolerant mutants. After UV irradiation, two Botrytis mutants grew on normally <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of 6 -PAP, while 59 mutants grew on normally <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of massoialactone. 6 -PAP mutants were cross resistant to normally <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of massoialactone, whereas massoialactone mutants {{were not able}} to grow on normally <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of 6 -PAP. After one generation of growth on kiwifruit slices, 6 -PAP mutants lost tolerance to normally <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of 6 -PAP. However after three generations of growth on kiwifruit slices, 6 -PAP plus massoialactone mutants retained tolerance to normally <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> to massoialactone...|$|R
40|$|The <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of {{convallatoxin}} in {{cats and}} guinea pigs {{were determined by}} the injection method. 1) The <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> of convallatoxin in cats was in accordance with data obtained by European scholars using Hatcher-Magnus infusion method. In guinea pigs, however, the results obtained by the injection method did not coincide with that as reported by European scholars using Knaffl-Lenz infusion method. The discrepancy is suggested {{to be caused by}} the difference in strains of guinea pig. 2) When the liver was blockaded from the portal circulation, the <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> of convallatoxin decreased markedly. The <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> decreased with the increase of the excluded portion of the liver. It is therefore surmised that the <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> of convallatoxin is considerably affected by the alteration of circulation in liver...|$|R
40|$|The <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> of {{digitoxin}} {{was determined}} with the injection method in guinea pigs and cats. The test solution was prepared by dissolving an alcoholic solution of digitoxin in an isotonic salt solution containing 0. 8 % CaCl 2 or 0. 58 % KCl. When CaC 12 was added, the <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> of digitoxin decreased markedly {{as compared to}} the <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> in control animals and the decreasing rate was at 27. 4 % in guinea pigs and 26 % in cats. On the other hand, when KCl was added, the <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> of digitoxin increased and the rate of increase in <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> was at 17 % in guinea pigs and 19. 8 % in cats. From the above results, it was ascertained that CaCl, increases the toxicity of digitoxin while KCl decreases the same...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} were performed with cats and guinea pigs {{to investigate the}} influence of portal circulation on the <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> of digitoxin. The data are summarized as follows : 1. The <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> is larger in cases when digitoxin is injected directly into mesenteric vein than in cases when injected into jugular or femoral vein. 2. When a part of liver is {{cut off from the}} portal circulation, the <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> decreases in both cases of intravenous and intraportal injections. There seems to be a parallel correlation between the increase of the excluded portion of liver and decrease of <b>lethal</b> <b>dose.</b> 3. The liver of guinea pig has a far larger capacity to hold digitoxin than that of cat. The difference of the liver capacity appears to be connected with the difference of the <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> between the two animals in question to a certain extent...|$|R
