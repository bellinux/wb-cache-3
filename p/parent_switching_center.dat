5000|$|In telecommunication, a {{store-and-forward}} <b>switching</b> <b>center</b> is {{a message}} <b>switching</b> <b>center</b> in which a message is accepted from the originating user, i.e., sender, when it is offered, held in a physical [...] storage, and forwarded to the destination user, i.e., receiver, {{in accordance with the}} priority placed upon the message by the originating user and the availability of an outgoing channel.|$|R
50|$|A {{reperforator}} <b>switching</b> <b>center</b> received messages via {{serial communication}} lines from teleprinters, {{such as the}} Teletype Model 28 ASR, or from other <b>switching</b> <b>centers</b> on receiving consoles, each consisting of a paper tape punch feeding tape into a paper tape reader via a storage bin. The reader decoded the message header, and sent the header characters to the director. The director, much like a telephone switch, connected the receiving console to a sending console in the same <b>switching</b> <b>center</b> by a cross-office connection. The message was transmitted from the receiving console to the sending console, character by character, punching a second paper tape at the sending console. Cross-office connections, and their readers and punches, were slightly faster than external connections, to limit congestion {{to the edges of}} the network. Each sending console also consisted of a paper tape punch and reader. Output from each sending console was transmitted via outgoing lines to other <b>switching</b> <b>centers</b> or to destination teleprinters. Each message typically contained one telegram.|$|R

5000|$|The public {{switched}} telephone network, {{the network}} of <b>switching</b> <b>centers,</b> trunk lines, amplifiers and switches which transmits telephone calls from one phone to another, is designed to carry voice frequency signals, and is therefore limited to a bandwidth of 3.4 kHz. Before DSL, voice-band modems transmitted information through the telephone network with audio frequencies within that bandwidth, which limited them to a data rate of about 56 kbit/s. However, the copper wires that connect telephones with the local <b>switching</b> <b>center</b> (telephone exchange), called the subscriber loop, are actually able to carry a much wider band of frequencies, up to several megahertz. [...] This capacity is unused in normal phone service. DSL uses these higher frequencies to send digital data between the DSL modem and the local <b>switching</b> <b>center,</b> without interfering with normal telephone service. At the local <b>switching</b> <b>center</b> the data is transferred directly between the customer's phone line and internet lines, so DSL signals do not travel through the telephone network itself. It {{is not necessary to}} dial a telephone number to initiate a connection; the DSL connection is [...] "on" [...] whenever the modem is on.|$|R

The model is a large scale integer program with up to 26, 000 integer variables and 35, 000 constraints for a problem with 160 candidate tower locations and 2000 customer demand points. Several heuristic solution proce-dures were developed and tested empirically on a series of 60 large problem instances. One of the proposed heuristic procedures consistently produces near-optimal solutions within reasonable computational times...|$|R
