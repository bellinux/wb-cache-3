40|$|The {{attention}} and {{respect of the}} qualitative aspects of wine production has brought about an ever increasing respect for the products utilised in all phases of transformation. In particular, the interaction of mechanical influences {{is considered one of}} the possible critical points in the wine making process (De Vita, De Vita 2004). There are numerous technological innovations aimed at reducing the effects of direct contact with mechanical influences; recent examples refer to the diffusion of a particular type of oenological pumps (peristaltic, mohno, etc.), pumpover systems (carbon air type, rotary, etc.) and the general utilisation of polymeric or elastic materials (De Vita, De Vita 2004). The more important technical innovation could very well regard the introduction of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>presses</b> (Eynard I, 1986) that up until the 70 ’s permitted a significant improvement in the initial phases of grape processing. The current availability of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>presses</b> able to work efficiently, with pressure levels that rarely exceed 2 bar, may lead one to believe that the evolution of this machinery has reached its maturation. This is absolutely not the case if one thinks of new construction principles and the utilisation of new materials. A recent innovation, still not widely embraced or diffused, is the central tubular membrane press built entirely of elastic materials. This solution was created with the intention of uniting the prestige qualities of a central membrane (improved relationship between drainage surface and pomace thickness) with the advantage of an elastic membrane (improved cleaning and homogeneous distribution of pressure when low pressure is utilised).

50|$|The Cordeliers cloister has {{a network}} of cellars and {{underground}} tunnels stretching for three kilometres beneath the village of Saint-Emilion. The constant temperature of 12 °C and total darkness they provide ensure perfect conditions for fermenting wines. LES CORDELIERS sparkling wines are produced and stored in these cellars using the traditional ‘champenoise’ method. The grapes are picked by hand using small, open trays and then lightly pressed (yielding 100l of wine per 150 kg of grapes) using <b>pneumatic</b> <b>presses.</b> This is followed by alcoholic fermentation and wine blending, using unique processes for each particular cuvée produced by LES CORDELIERS.

25|$|The trampled and de-stemmed {{harvest is}} then pressed. The {{type of wine}} press also affects the {{potential}} quality of the wine. Since the 1980s, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>presses</b> have improved the work involved by working in airtight conditions and allowing a fine control of the pressure to extract the juice without damaging the grapes. The juice or moût de goutte (Must of Drops) is the juice that flows naturally from the berries crushed under their own weight prior to pressing (on {{the way to the}} press). Trampling increases its proportion and makes the material profitable by processing a higher tonnage of grapes in the same time. The moût de presse (Must of the Press) is the juice flowing from the press from the pressure on the grapes. It concentrates the qualities or the defects of the grape: it is rich in aromas, colloids, or phenolic compounds. However, it can also be marked by olfactory defects, such as the smell of fungus on spoiled grapes or the vegetable smell of a harvest with insufficient maturity. The blending or not of the moût de goutte and the moût de presse musts and release depends on the health of the grapes, the method of pressing, and the style of wine intended. Manipulation of the grape before pressing increases the amount of lees and complicates pressing. For the development of a quality wine, their use is excluded or very limited.|$|R

40|$|Phenolic {{compounds}} {{are important}} constituents {{of white wine}} that can impart bitterness and astringency and influence stability and colour. The specific types and concentrations of phenolic compounds vary between the different grape tissues. For example grape skins contain much higher concentrations of phenolics than grape pulp. Consequently, grape processing techniques, particularly the method by which juice is expressed, can influence the phenolic profile of white wines. Concerns of elevated phenolic levels tend to lead to conservative practices such as limiting the time between machine harvesting and winery processing, {{and the use of}} relatively expensive batch draining and pressing equipment. Phenolic extraction during pomace contact, such as might occur after machine harvesting prior to winery processing, was investigated at a controlled laboratory scale. Contact time significantly increased phenolic extraction as did the fraction of broken berries. However, given the uncertainty in the amount of berry breakage in industrial practice, full scale transport trials should be performed by wineries where economic advantage could be gained from relaxing restriction on times between harvesting and winery processing. Techniques used for white grape juice expression both now and in the past were critically reviewed and winery sampling was performed to develop a practical understanding of operational issues. For the expression of juice from white grapes, <b>pneumatic</b> membrane <b>presses</b> have been increasingly adopted both for pressing and draining. This is principally a product of their ability to express high yields of juice with relatively low levels of phenolics and suspended solids. These devices can be operated in many different manners and quality and productivity is highly dependent on the specific mode of operation. Adaptive programmes based principally on continuous assessment of juice flow rate, and the use of conductivity measurement to monitor skin extraction are important tools that can aid economic optimisation of expression operations. The principal problem with the <b>pneumatic</b> membrane <b>press</b> {{is that it is a}} batch operation with a relatively low throughput. In the longer term, the ideal outcome would be the development of expression equipment that achieved the high throughput and relatively low cost per tonne of continuous inclined drainers and screw presses, while still maintaining the quality obtained with <b>pneumatic</b> membrane <b>presses.</b> Continuous devices that mimic the repeated cycles of compression and crumbling of these batch presses may be one means of achieving this. Exploration of the different continuous screw presses used historically suggests that there still may be room for improvement in these devices. This merits further specific investigation. Experiments involving repeated cycles of compression and crumbling were performed with a constant rate laboratory apparatus. These experiments demonstrated the importance of bed height, pressing speed, sieve plate design and crumbling on press operation. Solids content appears to be a major issue in the development of rapid juice expression equipment. One means of achieving appropriately low solids levels, without requiring large devices with large cake beds for juice filtration, may be to maintain the structure of the grape for as long as possible so that juice is filtered as it is expelled from the berry.
