30|$|The {{mesosphere}} (at altitudes {{from about}} 50 to 90  km) {{is a very}} important area of the atmosphere, critical to the understanding of energy coupling, but often very difficult to observe with radars. The mesosphere has a very complicated chemistry, characterised by neutral and charged molecular species and cluster ions consisting of ice and meteoric dust. This chemistry is controlled partly by energetic particle precipitation and also by dynamical processes in which waves, tides, winds, and turbulence generated in the lower atmosphere interact with those generated above (Vincent 1984). Adiabatic cooling of the upwelling air mass produces a temperature minimum of − 140  °C at the <b>polar</b> summer <b>mesopause</b> (about 85  km), making it the coldest region of the Earth’s environment (McIntyre 1989). This interplay of chemistry and dynamics is particularly manifested in the phenomenon of mesospheric thin layers, which show how both processes can affect this region of the upper atmosphere (e.g. Ecklund and Balsley 1981).|$|R
40|$|Modelling {{the energy}} {{budget in the}} {{mesosphere}} and lower thermosphere requires a precise evaluation of CO 2 distribution in this region. This distribution is primarily determined by competition between vertical eddy diffusion and molecular diffusion. A simple algorithm is proposed {{to take into account}} both processes, at all altitudes. Using the SOCRATES bi- dimensional model of the middle atmosphere, we show that molecular diffusion has a direct impact on CO 2 vertical distribution down to approximately 80 km altitude, i. e. well into the mesosphere and below the turbopause altitude. A sensitivity study with regard to different aeronomical processes shows that molecular diffusion has the deepest influence in the mesospheric polar night region. Our model shows that molecular diffusion of CO 2 is responsible for a <b>polar</b> night <b>mesopause</b> 12 K warmer than if this process was neglected.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the connection between}} mesopause temperature in summer and the induced circulation upon possible formation of the observed polar mesospheric (noctilucent) cloud layer (PMC), a two-dimensional semiempirical model {{is used to calculate}} the zonally averaged diabatic circulation. On the basis of the calculations, one may draw the following conclusions: (1) if the large departures from radiative equilibrium which occur at the summer mesopause at high latitudes should be balanced by adiabatic processes of the mean circulation alone, a vigorous circulation is needed (there is some evidence that such a vigorous circulation has been observed); (2) the vertical velocities of some cm/s at the <b>polar</b> summertime <b>mesopause</b> will support the formation of polar mesospheric clouds, because those large wind speeds support larger ice particles against gravitational sedimentation; and (3) a region of mild subsidence in the summertime midlatitude mesosphere due to the effect of nonlinear temperature advection would tend to limit the occurrence of ice particles to latitudes poleward of about 55 deg...|$|R
40|$|The {{decay of}} meteor trails in the <b>polar</b> <b>mesopause</b> re-gion {{is thought to}} be {{predominantly}} due to ambipolar diffusion, a process that is governed by the ambient temperature and pressure. However, other processes also play a role, including the absorption of electrons by the numerous charged species that occupy the same region. While the absorption may be relatively small, it can cause a disproportionate reduction in meteor decay time, depending on the initial strength of the meteor trail. This effect is enhanced in the presence of polar meso-spheric summer echoes (PMSE), phenomena arising most probably due to highly charged, sub-visible ice par-ticles that can exist at the extremely cold summer <b>polar</b> <b>mesopause.</b> These charged “dust ” particles absorb mul-tiple electrons from expanding, collocated meteor trails. 1...|$|E

Assuming a mono-modal Gaussian size distribution we deduce mean and width of the particle sizes throughout the clouds. We observe a quasi linear relationship between distribution width and mean of the particle size {{at the top of}} the clouds and a deviation from this behavior for particle sizes larger than 40 nm, most often in the lower part of the layer. The vertically integrated particle properties show that 65 % of the data follows the linear relationship with a slope of 0. 42 &plusmn; 0. 02. For the vertically resolved particle properties (&Delta;z= 0. 15 km) the slope is smaller and only 0. 39 &plusmn; 0. 03. We compare our observations to microphysical modeling of noctilucent clouds and find that the distribution width depends on turbulence, the time that turbulence can act (cloud age), and the sampling volume/time (atmospheric variability). The model results nicely reproduce the measurements and show that the observed slope can be explained by eddy diffusion profiles as observed from rocket measurements...|$|R
40|$|Time {{constants}} for photodetachment, photoemission, and {{electron capture}} are considered for {{two classes of}} mesospheric aerosol particles, i. e., meteor smoke particles (MSPs) and pure water ice particles. Assuming that MSPs consist of metal oxides like Fe 2 O 3 or SiO, we find that during daytime conditions photodetachment by solar photons is up to 4 orders of magnitude faster than electron attachment such that MSPs cannot be negatively charged {{in the presence of}} sunlight. Rather, even photoemission can compete with electron capture unless the electron density becomes very large (>> 1000 cm − 3) such that MSPs should either be positively charged or neutral in the case of large electron densities. For pure water ice particles, however, both photodetachment and photoemission are negligible due to the wavelength characteristics of its absorption cross section and because the flux of solar photons has already dropped significantly at such short wavelengths. This means that water ice particles should normally be negatively charged. Hence, our results can readily explain the repeated observation of the coexistence of positive and negative aerosol particles in the <b>polar</b> summer <b>mesopause,</b> i. e., small MSPs should be positively charged and ice particles should be negatively charged. These results have further important implications for our understanding of the nucleation of mesospheric ice particles {{as well as for the}} interpretation of incoherent scatter radar observations of MSPs...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the fate of}} the meteoric smoke in the Middle Atmosphere, and its effect on ice phenomena such as noctilucent clouds (NLC) and polar stratospheric clouds (PSC). The potential role of NLC as tracer for mesospheric processes and variability, and as a tool for monitoring this remote and inaccessible region, has generated substantial interest within the scientific community. The nucleation of ice in such a dry environment is not trivial. Supersaturation is considered too low for homogeneous nucleation. Hence, pre-existing condensation nuclei are deemed necessary, with smoke particles having long been considered the most likely candidate. Here we show that the atmospheric circulation transports meteoric smoke particles away from the polar region before they coagulate large enough to efficiently act as ice condensation nuclei. We also show that the charging of meteoric smoke, in combination with deviations from the mean thermal state, may solve this dilemma by significantly altering the ice nucleation properties of smoke. Thus, while it is highly questionable whether neutral smoke can provide sufficient amounts of condensation nuclei for ice formation at the <b>polar</b> summer <b>mesopause,</b> charged meteoric smoke proves to be a promising candidate to explain mesospheric ice phenomena as we observe them. We further show that the bulk of the meteoric material is transported to the Arctic winter stratosphere, yielding significantly higher concentrations of meteoric smoke in the region of PSC nucleation than has previously been believed. Our new predictions of meteoric smoke in this region may thus shed new light on open questions relating to PSC nucleation...|$|R

40|$|Observations of {{noctilucent clouds}} have {{revealed}} a surprising coupling between the winter stratosphere {{and the summer}} <b>polar</b> <b>mesopause</b> region. In spite of the great distance involved, this inter-hemispheric link has been suggested to be the principal reason for both the year-to-year variability and the hemispheric differences {{in the frequency of}} occurrence of these high-altitude clouds. In this study, we investigate the dynamical influence of the winter stratosphere on the summer mesosphere using simulations from the vertically extended version of the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM). We find that for both Northern and Southern Hemispheres, variability in the summer <b>polar</b> <b>mesopause</b> region from one year to another {{can be traced back to}} the planetary-wave flux entering the winter stratosphere. The teleconnection pattern is the same for both positive and negative wave-flux anomalies. Using a composite analysis to isolate the events, it is argued that the mechanism for interhemispheric coupling is a feedback between summer mesosphere gravity-wave drag (GWD) and zonal wind, which is induced by an anomaly in mesospheric cross-equatorial flow, the latter arising from the anomaly in winter hemisphere GWD induced by the anomaly in stratospheric conditions...|$|E

40|$|The Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM) {{has been}} used to examine the middle {{atmosphere}} response to CO 2 doubling. The radiative-photochemical response induced by doubling CO 2 alone and the response produced by changes in prescribed SSTs are found to be approximately additive, with the former effect dominating throughout the middle atmosphere. The paper discusses the overall response, with emphasis on the effects of SST changes, which allow a tropospheric response to the CO 2 forcing. The overall response is a cooling of the middle atmosphere accompanied by significant increases in the ozone and water vapor abundances. The ozone radiative feedback occurs through both an increase in solar heating and a decrease in infrared cooling, with the latter accounting for up to 15 % of the total effect. Changes in global mean water vapor cooling are negligible above ~ 30 hPa. Near the <b>polar</b> summer <b>mesopause,</b> the temperature response is weak and not statistically significant. The main effects of SST changes are a warmer troposphere, a warmer and higher tropopause, cell-like structures of heating and cooling at low and middlelatitudes in the middle atmosphere, warming in the summer mesosphere, water vapor increase throughout the domain, and O 3 decrease in the lower tropical stratosphere. No noticeable change in upwardpropagating planetary wave activity in the extratropical winter–spring stratosphere and no significant temperature response in the polar winter–spring stratosphere have been detected. Increased upwelling in the tropical stratosphere {{has been found to be}} linked to changed wave driving at low latitudes...|$|R
40|$|Noctilucent clouds (NLC), {{also called}} polar mesospheric clouds when {{observed}} from space, are the visible manifestation of water ice particles persistently {{present in the}} <b>polar</b> summer <b>mesopause</b> region, which is the coldest place on Earth. Because of their extraordinary height of about 83 km, they can become {{visible to the naked}} eye when the sun sinks below the horizon, providing a dazzling display of bluish light. Since these clouds are extremely sensitive to changes in their environment, their observation conveys unique information concerning the various processes taking place in the mesosphere. GOMOS is a stellar occultation instrument combining 4 spectrometers in the spectral range 250 to 950 nm (UV - visible - near IR) and 2 fast photometers (470 - 520 nm and 650 - 700 nm). On the day side, in addition to star light, GOMOS measures also the solar light scattered by the atmospheric molecules. In the summer polar days, NLC are clearly detected using the photometers signals. The sun-synchronous orbit of ENVISAT allows observing them in both hemispheres. The main properties of these clouds (occurrence frequency, radiance, altitude) have been retrieved from GOMOS data. A very high accuracy is possible thanks to the stellar occultation technique. Moreover, the observation of these clouds with the spectrometers provides the spectral dependence of the light scattered by the NLC particles, from which it is possible to derive their radii. These clouds at the edge of space have been studied using GOMOS data from 2002 to 2010. After a brief overview of retrieval methods, the climatology obtained for the main NLC characteristics will be presented, focusing on the seasonal and latitudinal coverage...|$|R

This data set was retrieved from the 4  years of spectroscopic limb data of the SCIAMACHY mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) measurement mode (mid- 2008 to early 2012). The Na layer has a nearly constant peak altitude of 90 – 93  km for all latitudes and seasons, and has a full width at half maximum of 5 – 15  km. Small but significant seasonal variations in Na are identified for latitudes less than 40 °, where the maximum Na number densities are 3000 – 4000  atoms cm− 3. At middle to high latitudes a clear seasonal variation with a winter maximum of up to 6000  atoms cm− 3 is observed. The high latitudes, which are only measured in the summer hemisphere, have lower number densities, with peak densities being approximately 1000  Na atoms cm− 3.

40|$|International audiencePolar {{mesosphere}} summer echoes (PMSE) {{are very}} strong radar echoes primarily studied in the VHF wavelength range from altitudes close to the <b>polar</b> summer <b>mesopause.</b> Radar waves are scattered at irregularities in the radar refractive index which at mesopause altitudes is effectively determined by the electron number density. For efficient scatter, the electron number density must reveal structures at the radar half wavelength (Bragg condition for monostatic radars; ~ 3 m for typical VHF radars). The question how such small scale electron number density structures are created in the mesopause region has been a longstanding open scientific question for almost 30 years. This paper reviews experimental and theoretical milestones {{on the way to}} an advanced understanding of PMSE. Based on new experimental results from in situ observations with sounding rockets, ground based observations with radars and lidars, numerical simulations with microphysical models of the life cycle of mesospheric aerosol particles, and theoretical considerations regarding the diffusivity of electrons in the ice loaded complex plasma of the mesopause region, a consistent explanation for the generation of these radar echoes has been developed. The main idea is that mesospheric neutral air turbulence in combination with a significantly reduced electron diffusivity due to the presence of heavy charged ice aerosol particles (radii ~ 5 ? 50 nm) leads to the creation of structures at spatial scales significantly smaller than the inner scale of the neutral gas turbulent velocity field itself. Importantly, owing to their very low diffusivity, the plasma structures acquire a very long lifetime, i. e., 10 min to hours in the presence of particles with radii between 10 and 50 nm. This leads to a temporal decoupling of active neutral air turbulence and the existence of small scale plasma structures and PMSE and thus readily explains observations proving the absence of neutral air turbulence at PMSE altitudes. With this explanation at hand, it becomes clear that PMSE are a suitable tool to permanently monitor the thermal and dynamical structure of the mesopause region allowing insights into important atmospheric key parameters like neutral temperatures, winds, gravity wave parameters, turbulence, solar cycle effects, and long term changes...|$|R

A linear diabatic gravity wave model is established and compared to a model of pure dynamical adiabatic gravity waves. The results indicate that the photochemistry has a damping effect on gravity waves in most regions of the stratosphere and mesosphere. However, the photochemistry has a destabilizing effect on gravity waves in the mesopause region. The photochemical heating process can induce a comparatively strong enhancement of gravity waves at the mesopause for lower temperatures. In the summer <b>polar</b> <b>mesopause</b> region, this growth rate may be greater by about one order of magnitude than the growth rate of gravity waves at other seasons and locations.|$|E

This suggests that processes other than ambipolar diffusion can {{play a significant role in}} trail diffusion. One particular mechanism, namely electron-ion recombination, is explored.

30|$|Due to {{its large}} amplitude, the QTDW has {{significant}} impact on the MLT and higher. Plumb et al. (1987) first noted that the pulse-like QTDW event in January 1984 caused a temporary but substantial change in the prevailing circulation of the MLT. Short-term effects due to the QTDW may explain the interannual variability of brightness of southern polar mesospheric clouds (PMC), which form {{as a consequence of the}} cold mesospheric temperatures at the summer pole (e.g. Pendlebury 2012). In large amplitude QTDW years, the brightness of southern PMC is reduced. Siskind and McCormack (2014) ascribe this effect to the QTDW depositing westward momentum that, acting through the Coriolis torque in Equation one, produces a southward flow that partially offsets the GW-driven equatorward, northward wind. Hence, there is a corresponding reduction in the upward motions at the pole with an accompanying reduction in the adiabatic cooling, leading to a temperature increase at the <b>polar</b> <b>mesopause.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Numerical Spectral Model (NSM) simulates the Quasi-biennial Oscillation (QBO) {{that dominates}} the zonal {{circulation}} {{of the lower}} stratosphere at low latitudes. In the model, the QBO is generated with parameterized small-scale gravity waves (GW), which are partially augmented in 3 D with planetary waves owing to baroclinic instability. Due to GW filtering, the QBO extends into the upper mesosphere, evident in UARS zonal wind and TIMED temperature measurements. While the QBO zonal winds are confined to equatorial latitudes, even in simulations with latitude-independent wave source, the associated temperature variations extend to high latitudes. The meridional circulation redistributes some of the QBO energy to focus it partially onto the Polar Regions. The resulting QBO temperature variations away from the equator tend to increase at higher altitudes to produce inter-annual variations that can exceed 5 K in the <b>polar</b> <b>mesopause</b> region [...] and our 3 D model simulations show that the effect is variable {{from year to year}} and can produce large differences between the two hemispheres, presumably due to interactions involving the seasonal variations. Modeling studies with the NSM have shown that long-term variations can also be generated by the QBO interacting with the seasonal cycles through OW node-filtering. A 30 -month QBO, optimally synchronized by the 6 -month Semi-Annual Oscillation (SAO), thus produces a 5 -year or semi-decadal (SD) oscillation [...] and observational evidence for that has been provided by a recent analysis of stratospheric NCEP data.

30|$|Large wave amplitudes lead to wave {{breaking}} and hence momentum deposition. This, in turn, produces body forces that drive large scale residual circulations. In the winter stratosphere (approximately 20 to 60 km), planetary wave breaking drives a residual circulation from the equator to the winter pole, {{while in the}} mesosphere, gravity wave {{breaking and}} dissipation drives a circulation from the summer to winter pole (e.g. see Andrews et al. 1987). The combined effects of these large-scale circulation patterns, usually {{referred to as the}} Brewer-Dobson circulation, can be profound. For example, the pole-to-pole circulation at the mesopause (approximately 85 to 90 km) leads to rising (descending) motions over the summer (winter) pole with associated adiabatic cooling (heating). These vertical motions produce temperatures that are more than 50 K cooler or warmer than would be expected by radiative equilibrium alone. In fact the summer <b>polar</b> <b>mesopause</b> is the coldest place in the Earth’s environment with temperatures of 120 K or lower.

In a recent study carried out with the Kühlungsborn Mechanistic general Circulation Model (KMCM), it was shown that the net effect of this interhemispheric coupling mechanism is a cooling of the summer polar mesospheres and that this temperature response is tied to the strength of the gravity wave-driven winter mesospheric flow. We here reconfirm the hypothesis that the summer polar mesosphere would be substantially warmer without the circulation in the winter mesosphere, using the widely-used Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM). In addition, the role of the stratosphere in shaping the conditions of the summer polar mesosphere is investigated. Using composite analysis, we show that if winter gravity waves are absent, a weak stratospheric Brewer-Dobson circulation would lead to a warming of the summer mesosphere region instead of a cooling, and vice versa. This is opposing the temperature signal of the interhemispheric coupling in the mesosphere, in which a cold winter stratosphere goes together with a cold summer mesopause. We hereby strengthen the evidence that the equatorial mesospheric temperature response, driven by the winter gravity waves, is a crucial step in the interhemispheric coupling mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The ECOMA {{series of}} rocket {{payloads}} use {{a set of}} aerosol particle, plasma, and optical instruments to study the properties of aerosol particles and their interaction with the ambient plasma environment in the <b>polar</b> <b>mesopause</b> region. In August 2007 the ECOMA- 3 payload was launched into a region with Polar Mesosphere Summer Echoes (PMSE) and noctilucent clouds (NLC). An electron depletion was detected in a broad region between 83 and 88 km, coincident with enhanced density of negatively charged aerosol particles. We also find evidence for positive ion depletion in the same region. Charge neutrality requires that a population of positively charged particles smaller than 2 nm and with a density of at least 2 &times; 10 8 m&minus; 3 must also have been present in the layer, undetected by the instruments. A numerical model for the charging of aerosol particles and their interaction with the ambient plasma is used to analyse the results, showing that high aerosol particle densities are {{required in order to}} explain the observed ion density depletion. The model also shows that a very high photoionisation rate is required for the particles smaller than 2 nm to become positively charged, indicating that these may have a lower work function than pure water ice...|$|E
40|$|Southern Hemisphere (SH) polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs), {{also known}} as noctilucent clouds, have been {{observed}} to be more variable and, in general, dimmer than their Northern Hemisphere (NH) counterparts. The precise cause of these hemispheric differences is not well understood. This paper focuses on {{one aspect of the}} hemispheric differences: the timing of the PMC season onset. Observations from the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere satellite indicate that in recent years the date on which the PMC season begins varies much more in the SH than in the NH. Using the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model, we show that the generation of sufficiently low temperatures necessary for cloud formation in the SH summer polar mesosphere is perturbed by year‐to‐year variations in the timing of the late‐spring breakdown of the SH stratospheric polar vortex. These stratospheric variations, which persist until the end of December, influence the propagation of gravity waves up to the mesosphere. This adds a stratospheric control to the temperatures in the <b>polar</b> <b>mesopause</b> region during early summer, which causes the onset of PMCs to vary from one year to another. This effect is much stronger in the SH than in the NH because the breakdown of the polar vortex occurs much later in the SH, closer in time to the PMC season...|$|E
