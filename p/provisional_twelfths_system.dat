40|$|Several design {{principles}} {{necessary to}} build high performance and reliable dis-tributed database systems have evolved from conceptual research, prototype implementa-tions, and experimentation during the eighties. This paper {{focuses on the}} important aspects of transaction processing, including: communication, concurrency, atomicity, replication, and recovery as they apply to distributed systems. Implementation of these in eleven experimental and commercial distributed systems are briefly presented. Details of a <b>twelfth</b> <b>system</b> called RAID that has been implemented by us are included to show our design and implementation strategies. The relationship between database and operating systems is discussed along with the desirable features in communication software for reli-able processing. This material has been presented to demonstrate the practicality of cer-tain successful design and implementation choices so as to benefit {{those who have the}} responsibility for making distributed systems work...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the rf {{system of the}} positron accumulator ing (PAR) of the 7 -GeV Advanced Photon Source. Two rf systems are described: a fundamental frequency system at 9. 8 MHz, and a <b>twelfth</b> harmonic <b>system</b> at 117. 3 MHz. A block diagram of an accelerating unit is shown and descriptions of various amplifier subsystems are given (including amplifier design, power coupling, VSWR protection, and cavity tuning control). We describe beam accumulation of 24 macropulses from the linac and the 9. 8 -MHz system used to both accumulate and bunch the beam during the 400 -mS injection time. Further bunching of the beam is done during the lOO-mS bunching time by the <b>twelfth</b> harmonic <b>system,</b> so that the bunch fits in the 352 -MHz bucket in the booster (injector syncluotron). Both tuning angle and cavity voltage of the <b>twelfth</b> harmonic <b>system</b> are preset with a feedforward system using a signal from the beam current monitor. Control signals which synchronize PAR with the linac and booster are described. Operating experience during the PAR commissioning will also be discussed. 1. POSITRON ACCUMULATOR RING (PAR) There are two rf systems in the PAR. One operates at 9. 8 MHz to accumulate beam from the linac, and a second operates at 117 MHz for the last 100 mS of the ~-HZ injection cycle to bunch the beam until extraction. Each system consists of one cavity, one rf amplifier, and associated control circuitry (see Figure 1). The control system also synchronizes operation Figure l- accelerating unit block diagram *Work supported by the U. S. Department o...|$|R

40|$|Shallow water {{equations}} (including {{the effect}} of earthâ€™s rotation) governing the flow in a paraboloidal basin or an eddy bounded by a free surface are studied both analytically and numerically. The system of governing PDE is first exactly reduced to a <b>twelfth</b> order <b>system</b> of nonlinear ODE. Several subsystems of the latter are derived under varying conditions and studied. Some of these subsystems admit exact analysis. Previous exact solutions of the PDE system are recovered as special cases. A fairly general sub-system of eighth order, which follows from the <b>twelfth</b> order <b>system</b> from the fact that, in the deformation modes, the internal motions of the fluid are unaffected by {{the motion of the}} center of mass, is studied numerically both when there is a supporting basin and when the outer boundary is free. It is found that when there is an elliptical basin, this system has both periodic and chaotic solutions. Time series, power spectra and Lyapunov exponents for different sets of parameters are computed and depicted. The present study may have application in warm core rings in the Gulf stream as well as tidal motions in basins...|$|R
50|$|Overall, China Education Resources {{is helping}} to {{transform}} the curriculum of the world's largest educational system. Recognizing the need for increased accessibility to address education reform policy changes, China Education Resource has created educational tools and curricula for China's entire kindergarten through <b>twelfth</b> grade <b>system.</b> By implementing goals of converting the existing educational system from memory-based learning to creative thinking and utilizing a more interactive approach to embrace a world-based economy, the company is playing {{an important role in}} positioning China's educational system reform.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{building was}} constructed in 1972 as a Junior High School. In 1978, the town voted to create a separate high school for the town's students, instead of sending them to Pinkerton Academy in Derry and Memorial High School in Manchester. The building then became a combination Junior/Senior High School. In 1982, a new Junior High School was built nearby, and the original building adopted its current ninth through <b>twelfth</b> grade <b>system.</b> The school has received several additions, including a separate two-story gymnasium which opened in January 2003.|$|R

It used a 1.193182 MHz clock signal (one third of the color burst frequency used by NTSC, one <b>twelfth</b> of the <b>system</b> clock crystal oscillator [...] ) and contains three timers.

50|$|Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) is {{a fourth}} through <b>twelfth</b> grade <b>system</b> that prepares {{students}} academically {{and make them}} eligible for college. Students involved in the program are enrolled in their school's most challenging and rigorous classes, Honors and AP, and develops each students organization and study skills. At Freedom High School, students will enroll in college preparatory courses and the AVID elective class. In the AVID class, students are taught the needed skills for success and tutored in collaborative working groups with mentors. In the AVID elective class student are taught study skills, Cornell note-taking system, time management, writing, reading, and research skills. Students also learn about colleges and universities (especially the application and financial aid processes) and prepare for college admission tests such as the SAT or ACT. Students are encouraged to explore occupations through research,curriculum, and guest speakers.|$|R
40|$|The {{cavities}} for {{the dual}} frequency {{system of the}} APS PAR [1] are described. The system uses two frequencies: a 9. 78 MHz fundamental system for the particle accumulation and a 117. 3 MHz <b>twelfth</b> harmonic <b>system</b> for the bunch compression. The cavities have been built, installed, tested, and used for storing the beam in the PAR for about a year. The fundamental cavity is a reentrant coaxial type with a capacitive loading plunger and has 1. 6 m length. The harmonic cavity is a symmetrical reentrant coaxial type and is 0. 8 m long. Ferrite tuners are used for frequency tuning. During the accumulation period, the ferrite tuner of the harmonic cavity works as a damper to disable the cavity. During an injection cycle the 9. 78 MHz system accumulates 24 positron bunches in a bucket and the 117. 3 MHz system compresses the bunch into a shorter bunch. Measurements were made on the rf properties of the cavities. I. INTRODUCTION Previously, the two cavities in the PAR of the APS were designed by computer [...] ...|$|R
