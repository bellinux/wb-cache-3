5|$|At first, USB was {{considered}} a complement to IEEE 1394 (FireWire) technology, which {{was designed as a}} high-bandwidth serial bus that efficiently interconnects <b>peripherals</b> such as disk drives, audio interfaces, and video equipment. In the initial design, USB operated at a far lower data rate and used less sophisticated hardware. It was suitable for small <b>peripherals</b> such as keyboards and pointing devices.|$|E
5|$|Ethernet {{standards}} require {{electrical isolation}} between the networked device (computer, phone, etc.) {{and the network}} cable up to 1500VAC or 2250VDC for 60seconds. USB has no such requirement as it was designed for <b>peripherals</b> closely associated with a host computer, and in fact it connects the peripheral and host grounds. This gives Ethernet a significant safety advantage over USB with <b>peripherals</b> such as cable and DSL modems connected to external wiring that can assume hazardous voltages under certain fault conditions.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{gives the}} results of a study of <b>peripheral</b> circulatory {{features}} during high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV). The main specific features of <b>peripheral</b> circulation and oxygen transport during HFJV are formulated {{on the basis of a}} study of cardiac output (impedance cardiography), <b>peripheral</b> vascular resistance, <b>peripheral</b> vascular blood filling (photoplethysmogram analysis), adaptive <b>peripheral</b> blood flow reactions (spectral analysis of <b>peripheral</b> vascular pulsation). HFJV gives rise to the peculiar pattern of <b>peripheral</b> hemodynamics and tissue gas exchange, which is characterized by higher oxygen uptake without a decrease in mixed venous blood saturation, with normal extraction coefficient and preserved low <b>peripheral</b> vascular resistance. During HFJV, unlike traditional ventilation, the main <b>peripheral</b> hemodynamic feature is the increased capillary bed blood volume caused by the blood flow involvement of reserve capillaries under control of volume (parasympathetic) regulation of adaptive <b>peripheral</b> hemodynamic reactions. Key words: high-frequency jet ventilation, oxygen transport, <b>peripheral</b> hemodynamics...|$|R

5|$|Sold {{exclusively}} in North America, the Nomad was never officially released worldwide, and employs a regional lockout.

5|$|To {{reliably}} {{enable a}} charge-only feature, modern USB accessory <b>peripherals</b> now include charging cables that provide power {{connections to the}} host port but no data connections, and both home and vehicle charging docks are available that supply power from a converter device and do not include a host device and data pins, allowing any capable USB device to charge or operate from a standard USB cable.|$|E
5|$|USB was {{designed}} to standardize the connection of computer <b>peripherals</b> (including keyboards, pointing devices, digital cameras, printers, portable media players, disk drives and network adapters) to personal computers, both to communicate and to supply electric power. It has largely replaced a variety of earlier interfaces, such as serial ports and parallel ports, as well as separate power chargers for portable devices – and has become commonplace {{on a wide range}} of devices.|$|E
5|$|All ports {{have been}} {{replaced}} with either two or four combination USB-C 3.1 ports that support Thunderbolt 3 and dual DisplayPort 1.2 signals, any {{of which can be}} used for charging. The MacBook Pro is incompatible with some older Thunderbolt 3 certified <b>peripherals,</b> including Intel's own reference design for Thunderbolt 3 devices. Furthermore, MacOS on MacBook Pro blocks certain classes of Thunderbolt 3 compatible devices from working by blacklisting them. Devices using HDMI, previous generation Thunderbolt, and USB will require an adapter to connect to the MacBook Pro. The models come with a 3.5 mm headphone jack, although TOSLINK functionality of older generation MacBook Pros has been removed.|$|E

50|$|Small fiber <b>peripheral</b> {{neuropathy}} {{is a type}} of <b>peripheral</b> neuropathy {{that occurs}} from damage to the small unmyelinated <b>peripheral</b> nerve fibers. These fibers, categorized as C fibers, are present in skin, <b>peripheral</b> nerves, and organs. The role of these nerves is to innervate the skin (somatic fibers) and help control autonomic function (autonomic fibers).

5|$|As in {{previous}} generations, Nintendo provided {{strong support for}} its new console with popular first-party franchises like Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, and Pokémon, among others. To appeal to casual and non-gamers, Nintendo developed a group of core Wii games, consisting of Wii Sports, Wii Play, Wii Fit, and Wii Music, where players {{make use of the}} motion-sensing abilities of the console and its <b>peripherals</b> to simulate real world activities. With the exception of Wii Music, the games and their sequels have all been highly successful.|$|E
5|$|Neither USB 1.0 nor 1.1 {{specified}} {{a design}} for any connector {{smaller than the}} standard type A or type B. Though many designs for a miniaturised type B connector appeared on many peripheral devices, conformance to the USB 1.x standard was fudged by treating <b>peripherals</b> that had miniature connectors {{as though they had}} a tethered connection (that is: no plug or socket at the peripheral end). There was no known miniature type A connector until USB 2.0 (rev 1.01) introduced one.|$|E

50|$|The star {{topology}} reduces {{the probability of}} a network failure by connecting all of the <b>peripheral</b> nodes (computers, etc.) to a central node. When the physical {{star topology}} is applied to a logical bus network such as Ethernet, this central node (traditionally a hub) rebroadcasts all transmissions received from any <b>peripheral</b> node to all <b>peripheral</b> nodes on the network, sometimes including the originating node. All <b>peripheral</b> nodes may thus communicate with all others by transmitting to, and receiving from, the central node only. The failure of a transmission line linking any <b>peripheral</b> node to the central node will result in the isolation of that <b>peripheral</b> node from all others, but the remaining <b>peripheral</b> nodes will be unaffected. However, the disadvantage is that the failure of the central node will cause the failure of all of the <b>peripheral</b> nodes.|$|R
5|$|Though most {{computers}} since mid-2004 can boot from USB {{mass storage}} devices, USB {{is not intended}} as a primary bus for a computer's internal storage. Buses such as Parallel ATA (PATA or IDE), Serial ATA (SATA), or SCSI fulfill that role in PC class computers. However, USB has one important advantage, {{in that it is}} possible to install and remove devices without rebooting the computer (hot-swapping), making it useful for mobile <b>peripherals,</b> including drives of various kinds (given SATA or SCSI devices may or may not support hot-swapping).|$|E

40|$|Background: Patients with {{diabetes}} and <b>peripheral</b> neuropathy demonstrate significantly reduced peak torques at the <b>peripheral</b> joints. Objectives: The {{aim of this}} study was to assess isometric and concentric peak torques of the hip joint in people with type II diabetes with and without <b>peripheral</b> neuropathy in comparison with healthy participants. Methods: 27 patients with type II diabetes including 15 patients without <b>peripheral</b> neuropathy, 12 patients {{with diabetes}} and <b>peripheral</b> neuropathy and 15 healthy people participated. Isometric and concentric peak torques of hip flexion, extension, adduction and abduction of the non-dominant leg were measured by motorized dynamometer. Results: Peak and average peak concentric torques of the hip extension and abduction in patients with diabetes and <b>peripheral</b> neuropathy were lower than those patients with diabetes and control group. Angle of extension peak torque was significantly greater in patients with diabetes and <b>peripheral</b> neuropathy compared with other groups. Angle of flexion peak torque was lower in the patients with diabetes and <b>peripheral</b> neuropathy. Conclusions: Torque related parameters in patients with type II diabetes with or without <b>peripheral</b> neuropathy, are different from healthy subjects. As a result, patients with diabetes especially with <b>peripheral</b> neuropathy are more susceptible of injury and disability in lower limbs.
