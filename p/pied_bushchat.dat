25|$|It is {{widespread}} in the Indian subcontinent, and ranges across Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. The males of northern populations have a brown back whose extent gradually reduces southwards with populations in the southern peninsula having an all black back. They are commonly found in open scrub areas and often seen running along the ground or perching on low thorny shrubs and rocks. The long tail is usually held up and the chestnut undertail coverts and dark body make them easily distinguishable from <b>pied</b> <b>bushchats</b> and oriental magpie robins.|$|R

5000|$|Among the Toda {{people in}} the Nilgiris, the <b>pied</b> <b>bushchat</b> or kāŗpiłc, is a bird of omen and the origin of its white wing patches is {{described}} in {{a story of a}} dairy priest Piu.f who in the ritual of churning milk forgot to remove the churning stick before fetching water from a stream. The bird attempted to obstruct him by blocking his path but he disregarded it and flicked off butter from his hands. The white spots remained but Piu.f met his death. The Kotas of the Nilgiris have an origin story to explain the sexual dimorphism of the <b>pied</b> <b>bushchat</b> but they consider the [...] "karyvaky" [...] bird to be one that foretells good omen.|$|E

Common birds are scarlet minivet, small minivet, black bulbul, Sri Lanka scimitar babbler, grey-headed canary-flycatcher, <b>pied</b> <b>bushchat,</b> and Sri Lanka scaly thrush. Indian pitta, Asian brown flycatcher, Kashmir flycatcher, Indian blue robin, pied thrush, black-throated munia, and large-billed leaf warbler are amongst the large number of migratory species.|$|E
50|$|Like most flycatchers, {{it makes}} sallies to capture insects {{and returns to}} its perch. It forages mainly in the lower storey but can {{sometimes}} be found {{on top of the}} canopy. The song is a series of rich warbling notes (having a resemblance to the call of the <b>pied</b> <b>bushchat)</b> while the usual call is a soft nasal chipping eep. They perch upright and produce the chipping note while flicking the tail up and down. The breeding season is from March to June but peak egg-laying is in April. The nest is built in a cavity in an earth bank or a tree hole. They also use the eaves of houses and wood-work of bridges. The nest is a cup with mosses and lichens on the outside with some feathers and is not very well lined on the inside. The usual clutch is two to three eggs. The eggs are creamy brown with a dense mottling close along the broadest part of the egg.|$|E
50|$|It {{prefers to}} prey on birds found in open areas {{and some of}} the species it has been {{recorded}} to hunt are Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), white-browed wagtail (Motacilla madaraspatensis), rosy starling (Sturnus roseus), chestnut-tailed starling (Sturnus malabaricus), Indian cuckoo (Cuculus micropterus), Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrinus), little ringed plover (Charadrius dubius), ashy-crowned finch-lark (Eremoptrix griseus), besides robins, quails, babblers, swifts, bulbuls, pipits, larks (mainly Calandrella, Alauda, Galerida sp.), pied cuckoo (Clamator jacobinus), rock pigeon (Columba livia), collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto), laughing dove (Streptopelia senegelensis), brown crake (Lanius cristatus), tailor bird (Orthotomus sutorius), brown shrike (Lanius cristatus), white-breasted kingfisher (Halcyon smyrnensis), little stint (Calidris minuta), plain martin (Riparia paludicola) and <b>pied</b> <b>bushchat</b> (Saxicola caprata). In addition mice, lizards, large insects are also taken. In one study in Bangladesh, adults fed mainly on small sparrow sized birds (72%) and Pipistrellus bats (28%). They may sometimes pirate prey obtained by other medium-sized raptors. Prey may sometimes be cached and eaten subsequently.The red-necked falcon drinks water where available during the afternoons. This has been observed both in India and in Africa, where it sometimes visits waterholes.|$|E
40|$|In the Lesser Sundas, {{rainforest}} {{is a key}} {{habitat for}} endemic and threatened birds but avian community patterns on Alor Island, Indonesia, have never been examined. In May 2002, systematic observations were made in two major habitat types in Tanglapui Timur village lands to describe comparative patterns of habitat use and bird species-richness and to identify populations of restricted-range bird species. There were substantial differences in avifaunal composition between rainforest and Eucalyptus savanna, although ordination of bird species by plots revealed a continuum. Bird species-richness {{did not differ significantly}} between habitats, but the following species groups were strongly associated with rainforest: globally restricted- range species, forest-specialists, Oriental and Australo-Papuan species and frugivores. This result was associated with substantial structural differences, including greater canopy cover and canopy height in rainforest. Three species were recorded significantly more frequently in Eucalyptus savanna (Brown Honeyeater, Lichmera indistincta; Golden-bellied Gerygone, Gerygone sulphurea; and <b>Pied</b> <b>Bushchat,</b> Saxicola coprata). All six restricted- range species known from Alor were recorded, indicating the importance of the study site for conservation. Study is needed of the taxonomic relations of Alor populations of Lesser Shortwing (Brachypteryx leucophrys) and Yellow-breasted Warbler (Seicercus montis) ...|$|E
