Therefore, <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste</b> removal is very necessary before its discharge from the pharma industry. The separation of drugs containing organic compounds in wastewater streams is failed by convectional and biological treatments. Thus, the reduction of harmful effects of pharmaceutical compounds is possible by heterogeneous photocatalysis process. Herein we reported the degradation of pharmaceutical concentration in <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste</b> by heterogeneous photocatalyst ZnO doped with Selenium prepared by cost effective hydrothermal method. In addition the heavy metals in <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste</b> were also removed by ZnO/Se nanocomposite. The average band gap of nanocomposite (~ 2. 5 eV) increase the photocatalytic activity and degrade the organic compounds in <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste.</b> The heavy metals get adsorbed on the high surface area of nanocomposite and removed completely by filtration method. The Selenium doped ZnO photocatalyst semiconductor was characterized by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDAX) and also the characteristic crystalline forms of ZnO/Se nanocomposite was confirmed by XRD.

This work looks at <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes</b> as a source of valuable active compounds proposing the use of novel aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) composed of quaternary ammonium compounds and different salts to the extraction of active substances from <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes.</b> The phase diagrams of ABS of six quaternary ammonium halides ([N- 2,N- 2,N- 2,N- 2]Br, [N- 2,N- 2,N- 2,N- 2]Cl, [N- 3,N- 3,N- 3,N- 3]Cl, [N- 4,N- 4,N- 4,N- 4]Br and [N- 4,N- 4,N- 4,N- 4]Cl) and three different salts (potassium citrate buffer, potassium carbonate and potassium phosphate buffer) were established at 298 (+/- 1) K. These systems allow the investigation of the influence of the ammonium structure, the salting-out agent, and the pH of the aqueous medium. They were then applied to the extraction of paracetamol that displays an extensive partition towards the ammonium-rich phase. All the studied systems, employing both the model compound and real matrix reveal a great aptitude to recover paracetamol from <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes,</b> presenting extraction efficiencies ranging from around 80 % up to 100 %.

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{developing}} a sustainable process for the recovery of valuable drugs from <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes</b> using ionic liquid (IL) -based aqueous biphasic systems (ABS). Because in <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes,</b> excipients represent the major contaminants, the search for selective routes for their elimination is of primordial relevance and for that purpose IL-based ABS were evaluated. The effects of different process parameters, namely the IL nature, pH and mixture composition used in the extraction system, were studied and the process was optimized to maximize the extraction of the antidepressant from <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes.</b> Moreover, {{the maximum amount of}} amitriptyline able to be processed using such systems was assessed. The set of ABS investigated herein revealed a high extraction performance, as indicated by the outstanding logarithmic functions of the amitriptilyne partition coefficients ranging from 2. 41 +/- 0. 05 to > 2. 5 and extraction efficiencies between 66 % +/- 1 % and 100 %. The best ABS and conditions were considered in the development of an integrated multi-step purification process. The process here proposed comprises three main stages as follows: the solid-liquid extraction of the antidepressant from ADT 25 pills, its purification using the optimal IL-based ABS and the antidepressant isolation by precipitation with anti-solvent. After the removal of most water insoluble excipients in the first step, with the selected IL-based ABS, it was possible to further eliminate water soluble contaminants. A high capability of extraction and purification, leading to the selective separation of amitriptyline hydrochloride from the main contaminants contained in solid <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes</b> was achieved.

The ibuprofen extraction and isolation from solid <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes</b> is used here {{as a case study}} and an integrated approach comprising the ibuprofen solid-liquid extraction, the removal of the insoluble excipients present in the pills, the target drug recovery and the recycling of the aqueous solutions is proposed. The present work is centred on the optimization of the first (solid-liquid extraction) and third (drug recovery) steps mentioned above. For the solid-liquid extraction step, various ionic liquid aqueous solutions were tested, tetrabutylammonium chloride ([N- 4444]Cl) being adopted to further optimize the process. A solution composed of 45 wt% of [N- 4444]Cl + 5 wt% of citrate buffer + 50 wt% of H 2 O led to the highest ibuprofen extraction efficiency (EEIBU = 97. 92 +/- 2. 65 %) while in the absence of citrate the extraction efficiency was somewhat lower (EEIBU = 93. 53 +/- 0. 62 %). The polishing task was affected by the type of aqueous solution utilized during the solid-liquid extraction step: in the presence of citrate buffer water was not prone to induce significant ibuprofen precipitation (maximum REIBU of 34. 71 +/- 4. 00 %) the aqueous KCl solution being the best option (maximum REIBU of 87. 97 +/- 1. 00 %); when no citrate buffer is used water can be used as an anti-solvent with a maximum REIBU of 91. 60 +/- 0. 19 % while aqueous KCl solutions lead to an REIBU up to 97. 07 +/- 0. 14 %.

The catabolic property of microorganisms to utilize the contaminant as carbon and energy source is conveyed by the genes present in the potential microorganism, which encode for specific enzymes in catabolic pathways.

This problem led to the main question in this bachelor thesis: “How sustainable do Dutch consumers act with their pharmaceutical disposals?” To investigate the factors that influence environmentally significant behaviour in <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste</b> disposal, I carried out a survey that reached 203 respondents in The Netherlands. I used several theories to construct the reasons how people make decisions in disposal of unused pharmaceuticals and why they throw them away by household waste or via sink or toilet for example. Included in this study are multiple (socio-) demographic factors and assumptions based on relevant literature. I found that environmental concerned people bring their medication to the pharmacy more often than people who are not concerned about the environment. However, there seems to exist incongruence between the attitude and actual behaviour. Women and elderly people show more sustainable behaviour regarding <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste.</b> Being informed about the possibility to bring medication back to the pharmacy was a significant predictor for sustainable behaviour regarding <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste.</b> The awareness of the harmful effects is also a significant predictor for sustainable behaviour.

40|$|Summary: The {{presence}} of pharmaceuticals {{in the environment}} has become an environmental issue. Although human excretion {{has been identified as}} the main factor contributing to the environmental loading of pharmaceuticals, improper disposal practices can also contribute to this problem. In Canada, survey results showed that consumers tend to dispose a large part of their unused and expired pharmaceuticals in regular waste and down the drain. Therefore, a change in the behaviour of consumers regarding their disposal practices could help reduce the environmental exposure to these chemicals. In this context, this paper identifies and assesses pharmaceutical disposal programs offered to the public. Programs identified aim at increasing proper disposal of pharmaceuticals and/or reducing <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste.</b> The main findings are: (1) Canada does not have a nation-wide pharmaceutical disposal program but a variety of programs are established at provincial, municipal, and community levels; (2) across the Canadian province-wide programs, Alberta seems to divert the most quantity, in absolute terms, of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste</b> from household wastes and sewe...|$|E

Introduction: There {{has been a significant}} rise in the use of medical pharmaceuticals to combat disease and ill‑health across the WHO European Region. However, global estimates suggest that over half of all medicines are prescribed, dispensed or sold inappropriately, and that half of all patients fail to take them as directed. As well as impacting negatively on individual health, and resulting in extensive resource waste, pharmaceutical use – and “misuse” – can have significant adverse repercussions on wildlife and ecosystems, particularly when unused medicines are disposed of inappropriately. Methods: This paper examines the rise in medicine (mis) use, and considers what is known about <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste</b> in the environment. While technological responses to alleviate the impacts of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste</b> exist, they are costly and complex, and do not address the root causes of the problem. Results: This paper demonstrates how incorporating a cultural perspective can help us to understand not just how medicines can be more thoughtfully disposed of, but why particular medicines are administered to, and consumed or disposed of by, particular population groups in the first place. Conclusion: Understanding the ways that people’s perceptions, beliefs, and social norms and values interrelate with medicine prescribing, consumption and disposal practice is key to alleviating medicine misuse...|$|E

In this study, Acetaminophen photo catalytic removal from aqueous solutions was investigated by X zeolite modified with TiO 2 (TiO 2 / X zeolite). Methods: This study was experimental and carried out on a laboratory scale. To remove acetaminophen from aqueous solution, TiO 2 /X zeolite photo-catalyst under UV-C radiation (UV/TiO 2 -X process) was used. Acetaminophen concentration of soluble was measured using by spectrophotometer UV/Vis in λmax ~ 243 nm. The optimal conditions of pH, catalyst dosage, acetaminophen initial concentration and reaction time were determined and also acetaminophen disintegration reaction kinetics was studied by TiO 2 -X catalyst. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. Results: The results indicated that maximum removal of acetaminophen(95. 45 %) was related to 1 mg/L of initial concentration in the neutral pH and a catalyst concentration of 500 mg/L after 75 min of start of photo-catalytic reaction. By decreasing concentration of acetaminophen its removal rates will increase.
