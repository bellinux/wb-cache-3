30|$|The {{retransmission}} circuit {{is highlighted}} in Fig. 4. This circuit {{is responsible for}} keeping the data <b>package</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transmitted in its structure and, in case of failure, retransmit it in the fastest possible time. Because of that, this circuit has a FIFO (PKG_FIFO), which stores the <b>package</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transmitted, and two multiplexers (MUX_RT and MUX_TX) that select the correct path for the data <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sent. The data <b>package</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transmitted, after being required in the FIFO_INPUT, goes to the physical layer (TRANS_PHY) through the MUX_TX component. Simultaneously, {{a copy of the}} package is temporarily stored in the retransmission FIFO (PKG_FIFO) by the MUX_RT component. If there is a problem in the transmission, and the NACK signal takes a high logic level, the data previously stored in PKG_FIFO will be read and transmitted to the receiver via the MUX_TX and TRANS_PHY modules, respectively. A feedback loop ensures that this package can be retransmitted at other times, up to the value of MAX_RETX previously stipulated in the project. By default, this value is 10.|$|R
