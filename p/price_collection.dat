50|$|Basic {{types of}} data that are needed to {{construct}} the CPI: price data and weighting data. The price data are collected for a sample {{of goods and services}} from a sample of sales outlets in a sample of locations for a sample of times. The weighting data are estimates of the shares of the different types of expenditure in the total expenditure covered by the index. These weights are usually based upon expenditure data obtained from expenditure surveys for a sample of households or upon estimates of the composition of consumption expenditure in the National Income and Product Accounts. Although some of the sampling of items for <b>price</b> <b>collection</b> is done using a sampling frame and probabilistic sampling methods, many items and outlets are chosen in a commonsense way (purposive sampling) that does not permit estimation of confidence intervals. Therefore, the sampling variance cannot be calculated. In any case, a single estimate is required in most of the purposes for which the index is used.|$|E

50|$|Rabbi Price {{was also}} known for his {{impressive}} collection of rabbinic materials. By 1950 The Toronto Daily Star reported on his library:As Rabbi A. A. Price works in his study on Palmerston Blvd., he is surrounded by what is probably the largest private library of Hebrew books on this continent, a total of 2,200 volumes. Among them is one published in Italy 416 years ago and written by Benjamin Zev, a physician and scholar. There is only on other copy of Zev’s book know to exist {{and it is in}} the British Museum....Rabbi Price’s present library represents {{less than half of the}} original collection owned by the Polish-born, 51-year-old rabbi. He had them brought over after he decided to extend a visit to Toronto in 1935 into a permanent stay. The rest of his books were destroyed in Paris by the Germans a week before the French capital was liberated. His brother and sister were killed in France by the Nazis, and recently an orphaned niece arrived in Toronto.Many of his older books are now held at the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library at the University of Toronto in the <b>Price</b> <b>Collection</b> of Rabbinics.|$|E

40|$|The International Comparison Program (ICP) was {{established}} as a system for performing cross-country comparisons. Gross domestic product (GDP) and its components are converted into a single currency using purchasing power parities (PPP) thereby eliminating the shortcomings from using market exchange rates for establishing comparable levels of GDP across countries and estimating poverty based on internationally comparable poverty lines. The 2005 ICP for Asia and the Pacific has been hailed as a milestone in statistics with the participation of 23 economies in the Asia and Pacific region and the simultaneous participation of the People’s Republic of China and India, but concerns confronting past ICP activities still remain. This paper attempts to provide alternative {{ways to improve the}} operational aspects of ICP <b>price</b> <b>collection</b> on which to base future ICP data operations, and to do so without countries having to incur significant increases in regular budget outlays. Hence the integration of consumer price index and ICP work is confined only to the household consumption aggregate of national accounts. Further, it explores how a more refined approach that modifies and expands existing procedures for <b>price</b> <b>collection</b> can be implemented, and how the ICP approaches can be integrated and sustained by countries even for nonbenchmark years. ...|$|E

40|$|The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act {{created a}} new set of rules for nonprofit {{hospitals}} to maintain their federal tax-exemption, codified at Section 501 (r) of the Internal Revenue Code. The 501 (r) rules attempt {{to address the problem of}} hospitals’ excessive prices and onerous debt collection actions against self-pay patients by imposing fair <b>pricing</b> and debt <b>collection</b> requirements for patients eligible for financial assistance. Nevertheless, the 501 (r) rules leave many financially vulnerable patients unprotected: those who receive care at for-profit hospitals and those who find themselves ineligible under a hospital’s self-defined criteria for financial assistance. Protection by the 501 (r) rules is not only uneven, it is also opaque, based on circumstances and information the patient cannot easily discover or control, creating a kind of fairness roulette. The ramifications of losing the fairness roulette for the patient can mean the difference between a manageable medical bill and financial ruin. There is no good reason to limit fair <b>pricing</b> and <b>collection</b> requirements to tax-exempt hospitals. Fairness is not charity because requiring a hospital to charge a fair price does not require it to give services away for free or at a loss. This article proposes to decouple the fair <b>pricing</b> and <b>collection</b> rules from a hospital’s tax status, and instead make compliance with these rules a condition of participation in Medicare. Under this proposal, all hospitals that participate in Medicare would have to limit charges and collection activities for uninsured and underinsured self-pay patients who fall within certain income limits or whose medical bills exceed a defined percentage of income. Because fair hospital <b>pricing</b> and <b>collection</b> requirements are not charity, we should be treated fairly by any hospital regardless of its tax status...|$|R
