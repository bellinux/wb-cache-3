50|$|The {{permissible}} built-up {{construction in}} the area allotted to AIIMS is 50.92 per cent as per Table 14.2 of the notified Master Plan. The Building Construction Regulation Bye Laws 2014, restricts the ground coverage of such institutional buildings to 35 per cent as per clause 26 (1) (c). Therefore, the AIIMS construction would cover a maximum area of 35 per cent of the <b>plot</b> <b>area</b> and leave the balance 65 per cent as open space. The wetlands, hills, rivers, natural streams, forest constitute only 20.25 per cent of the <b>plot</b> <b>area.</b> Hence this area obviously need not be touched at all.|$|E

40|$|Large {{patch of}} zoysiagrass (Zoysia spp.) {{is caused by}} Rhizoctonia solani {{anastomosis}} group 2 - 2 LP. The effects of summer cultivation (core-aerification, verticutting, and sand topdressing) and spring and fall versus summer nitrogen (N) fertilization on large patch in fairway height ‘Meyer’ zoysiagrass were investigated from 2008 to 2011 in Manhattan, Haysville, and Olathe, KS. Disease was assessed by measuring patch diameters or analyzing digital images of affected <b>plot</b> <b>areas</b> to determine the percentage of non-green turfgrass within patches. Cultivation did not affect thatch temperature, soil temperature, soil water content, or turf recovery from large patch in early summer. Furthermore, cultivation {{did not result in}} overall significant reductions in patch diameters or average weekly rate of patch diameter increase among plots at the three experimental locations. In some site–year combinations, spring and fall N fertility was associated with lower percentages of non-green turf within affected <b>plot</b> <b>areas</b> in Manhattan and Haysville. In some cases, applications of N during spring and fall may alleviate large patch symptoms...|$|R

40|$|Species {{diversity}} {{is one of}} the most important indices used for evaluating the sustainability of forest. This study aims to characterize the large-leaved lime stand and to identify and compare the tree species diversity in the study area. In order to study biodiversity of woody species of large-leaved lime (Tilia platyphyllos Scop.) in the forests of Noshahr of Mazandaran province in the north Iran, three experimental sites in three elevations have been selected. Moreover, each selected site covers three <b>plots</b> with an <b>area</b> of one hectare (100 × 100 meter). In totally, 9 plots have been chosen to study. We described the population structure of the tree species using stem density, basal area, diameter at breast height (DBH) distribution, and diversity indices. Richness is defined as the number of species in the study area and abundance as the number of all individuals. To quantify the diversity of the plant species, the Shannon index and the Simpson index were considered. Duncan test was used to investigate the differences in the species richness, diversity and evenness indices among the different sampling <b>plot</b> <b>areas.</b> There were significant differences in the diversity index between sampling <b>plot</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
