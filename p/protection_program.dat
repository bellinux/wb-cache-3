40|$|The {{community-based}} <b>protection</b> <b>programs</b> {{constitute the}} essential strategy in controlling the cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The community-based <b>protection</b> <b>programs</b> {{were brought to}} the agenda in the US in early 1970 s. The aim of the programs was to modify the CVD risk factors and also to reduce the morbidity and mortality of such diseases. The community-based <b>protection</b> <b>programs</b> are networks of comprehensive and integrated studies which aim at direct education of the general public, not limited to medical care, use the entire social communication networks, and which obtain support from the leaders in a public. Within the course of time, we observe that the community-based programs evolved in three generations. The goal of the first generation community-based <b>protection</b> <b>programs</b> comprised of applications that targeted the entire society, aimed at forming appropriate behavior in individuals, and contained multiple interventions. Even though the second generation community-based <b>protection</b> <b>programs</b> resembled the first one, their common points were that both were better planned and financed. The third generation community-based <b>protection</b> <b>programs</b> were adapted from the first and second ones, and are being implemented in communities with high prevalence of CVD risk factors, in city centers, in low-income societies, and in groups like school children. Consequently, the community health care policy-makers need to develop new, more effective, commonly accepted and applicable community-based <b>protection</b> <b>programs</b> for the solution of CVD issue.

5|$|Alongside the fatalities, {{the floods}} left several {{blocks of the}} town without power. Water lines, bridges, and other {{infrastructure}} sustained varying degrees of damage. Several homes sustained water and mud damage. Total losses in Washington County reached $750,000. Flooding continued downstream into Arizona, rendering multiple roads impassible and damaging bridges around Colorado City; losses in the city amounted to $500,000. Around 150federal personnel and 500community volunteers, including 70–80percent of Hildale's residents, conducted search and rescue in the immediate aftermath. Twenty-four members of Utah Task Force One and twenty-six personnel from the Utah National Guard were dispatched to Hildale to assist in search and rescue along Short Creek. Dangerous conditions along the creek slowed the operation. By September17, 300personnel were searching for a 6-year-old boy who was still missing. Ultimately, thousands of people from more than 60agencies {{took part in the}} search for the final victim; efforts were called off by September29 and the missing boy was presumed dead. Local residents continued periodic searches for the boy through December. The Utah Department of Public Safety granted the Public Safety Award to Washington County Sheriff Cory Pulsipher, Hildale Mayor Philip Barlow and, Hildale Marshall’s Office Chief Jeremiah Darger for their response coordination. Following the floods, the Washington County allocated $1.6million through the Natural Resources Conservation Service for repair costs and mitigation efforts for future floods. Of this total, $1.5million went to Hildale. The United States Department of Agriculture also provided $100,000 through the Emergency Watershed <b>Protection</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E
