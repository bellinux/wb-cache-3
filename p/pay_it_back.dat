5|$|As the {{treasurer}} of the riches of the world, Kubera is prescribed to be worshipped. Kubera also credited money to the god Venkateshwara (a form of the god Vishnu) for his marriage with Padmavati. In remembrance of this, the reason devotees go to Tirupati to donate money in Venkateshwara's Hundi ("Donation pot"), is {{so that he can}} <b>pay</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to Kubera.|$|E
5|$|Carmella is {{introduced}} as a barmaid at the Erinsborough bar Lou's Place. She becomes romantically involved with her colleague, Connor O'Neill (Patrick Harvey), to the disapproval {{of her father}} Rocco (Robert Forza). A feud with Connor's ex-girlfriend, Michelle Scully (Kate Keltie), results in Carmella slapping her and leaving the area. She later returns in 2004, reconciles with Connor and helps him to maintain access to his daughter Madeleine (Madison Lu). To prove that she is business-minded, Carmella becomes a magazine editor. She departs from Erinsborough suddenly after she becomes {{the victim of a}} stalker, Frank Romano (Lliam Amor). Before she leaves, she drives around with a shotgun in an attempt to kill Frank. Upon her return, Carmella loses Connor's affection to Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher). She attempts to ruin their relationship, which results in Serena's mother Liljana (Marcella Russo) slapping her to warn her off. Carmella then tries a different approach; she borrows money from her mother Lucia (Maria Mercedes) to pay for an operation Madeleine needs, then blackmails Connor into spending time with her. She claims to have borrowed the money from a crime mob who are harassing her for repayment, which prompts Connor to steal money to try to <b>pay</b> <b>it</b> <b>back.</b> When Carmella realises the trouble she has caused, she tells Connor the truth and leaves.|$|E
25|$|Simply put, {{the test}} is that one must universalize the maxim (imagine that all people acted in this way) and then see if {{it would still be}} {{possible}} to perform the maxim in the world without contradiction. In Groundwork, Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to <b>pay</b> <b>it</b> <b>back.</b> This is a contradiction because if it were a universal action, no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty).|$|E

25|$|The crisis, which {{eventually}} became {{the catalyst for}} the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, almost developed into a run on money funds: the redemptions caused a drop in demand for commercial paper, preventing companies from rolling over their short-term debt, potentially causing an acute liquidity crisis: if companies cannot issue new debt to repay maturing debt, {{and do not have}} cash on hand to <b>pay</b> <b>it</b> <b>back,</b> they will default on their obligations, and may have to file for bankruptcy. Thus there was concern that the run could cause extensive bankruptcies, a debt deflation spiral, and serious damage to the real economy, as in the Great Depression.|$|E
25|$|On 22 June 2017, Theresa May {{stated in}} the House of Commons that anyone {{affected}} by the tragedy, regardless of their immigration status, would be entitled to support, including healthcare services and accommodation. No immigration checks would be performed on those affected. (Two weeks later, however, the government said that anyone coming forward {{would be subject to}} normal immigration rules, including the possibility of deportation, after twelve months.) May added that it was important for those receiving payments from the fund to understand that they could keep the money – they would not have to <b>pay</b> <b>it</b> <b>back,</b> and it would not impact their entitlement to any other benefits.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the defence}} {{of the area}} {{involved}} {{the construction of a}} cross bank across its south eastern edge, to prevent flood water from the Lakenheath Little Fen reaching the Burnt Fen. The costs of building this were large, as were the costs of maintaining the river banks, and so in 1772, a second Act of Parliament was obtained, authorising the raising of the drainage rate to 2 shillings (10p) per acre for ten years, and the imposing of penalties for late payment of the rates. A third Act was obtained in 1796, to raise the rates to 3/6 (17.5p) per acre, and kept them solvent for another eleven years. By 1807, they had borrowed £11,500 to finance the work, with little prospect of being able to <b>pay</b> <b>it</b> <b>back.</b> A fourth Act of Parliament increased the rates again, and changed the constitution of the Commissioners.|$|E

[...] Mr. Paik sends Jin (Daniel Dae Kim) to LA to give Keamy a watch and $25,000, intended to be Keamy's reward for killing Jin. However, the money is confiscated at customs in LAX, and Keamy is disappointed to discover it missing. [...] He takes Jin to a restaurant and has him tied up in a freezer. [...] Shortly after, Omar, one of Keamy's henchmen, captures Sayid and brings him to the same restaurant.

500|$|The war worsened {{currency}} and finance problems in Massachusetts. [...] The province had been issuing paper currency since the 1690s, {{and the issue}} of large amounts of this currency was causing it to depreciate relative to precious metals used in other currencies. [...] The question of how to resolve the situation caused a division between the colonists and the governor which was not repaired until the 1760s. [...] Business leaders who borrowed money were happy to <b>pay</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> later with depreciated currency, while lenders sought reforms to stabilize the currency. [...] In 1714, a major proposal was floated by Dudley's opponents in which a land bank would issue as much as £50,000 in currency, secured by the shareholder's properties. [...] Dudley was opposed to this scheme, and instead convinced the provincial legislature to issue £50,000 in bills of credit. [...] The financially powerful interests whom he upset with this move proved to be his downfall.|$|E

5000|$|... "Pay it forward" [...] is {{implemented}} in contract law of loans {{in the concept}} of third party beneficiaries. Specifically, the creditor offers the debtor the option of paying the debt forward by lending it to a third person instead of <b>paying</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to the original creditor. This contract may include the provision that the debtor may repay the debt in kind, lending the same amount to a similarly disadvantaged party once they have the means, and under the same conditions. Debt and payments can be monetary or by good deeds. A related type of transaction, which starts with a gift instead of a loan, is alternative giving. <b>Pay</b> <b>it</b> forward is an action made.|$|R

The Talmud states that if gentiles rob Israel of silver, they will <b>pay</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> in gold, and all that is taken will be paid back in folds, but in cases like these, there is nothing to pay back, since as I said – the life of one yeshiva boy is worth more than the lives of 1,000 Arabs".|$|E
2500|$|A {{proposed}} maxim {{can fail}} to meet the above requirement {{in one of two}} ways. First, one might encounter a scenario in which one’s proposed maxim would become impossible {{in a world in which}} it is universalized. For example, suppose a person in need of money makes it her maxim to attain a loan by making a false promise to <b>pay</b> <b>it</b> <b>back.</b> If everyone followed this principle, nobody would trust another person when she made a promise, and the institution of promise-making would be destroyed. But, the maxim of making a false promise in order to attain a loan relies on the very institution of promise-making that universalizing this maxim destroys. Kant calls this type of contradiction a ‘contradiction in conception’ because it is impossible to conceive of the maxim being universalized. (4:424) ...|$|E

[...] Congress could borrow money, but couldn't <b>pay</b> <b>it</b> <b>back.</b> No state paid all their U.S. taxes; some paid nothing. [...] Some few paid an amount equal to interest on the national debt owed to their citizens, but no more. No interest was paid on debt owed foreign governments.
