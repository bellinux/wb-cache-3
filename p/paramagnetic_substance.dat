30|$|These gradient-echo {{sequences}} are acquired {{with a long}} echo time (TE) {{in order}} {{to take full advantage of}} the magnetic susceptibility phenomenon. Magnetic susceptibility corresponds to the variation in the local magnetic field of a material exposed to an external magnetic field. This occurs for instance in the venous compartment, which contains a large amount of deoxyhaemoglobin, a highly <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>substance.</b> Paramagnetic substances create a field oriented in the same direction as the higher intensity main field, leading to a lower local signal. When a long TE is used, the dephasing resulting from spin-spin interactions and field heterogeneity is increased. TE can thus be set to yield a phase opposition phenomenon between deoxyhaemoglobin and the adjacent parenchyma, further lowering the signal [1]. Moreover, magnetic susceptibility evolves proportionally with the B 0 magnetic field so that the phenomenon is more marked with 3  T than 1.5  T.|$|E

40|$|In 1846, Michael Faraday {{found that}} {{permanent}} magnets could cause candle flames to deform into equatorial disks. He {{believed that the}} change in flame shape {{was caused by the}} presence of charged particles within the flames interacting with the magnetic fields. Later researchers found that the interaction between the flame ions and the magnetic fields were much too small to cause the flame deflection. Through a force analysis, von Engel and Cozens showed that the change in the flame shape could be attributed to the diamagnetic flame gases in the paramagnetic atmosphere. Paramagnetism occurs in materials composed of atoms with permanent magnetic dipole moments. In the presence of magnetic field gradients, the atoms align with the magnetic field and are drawn into the direction of increasing magnetic field. Diamagnetism occurs when atoms have no net magnetic dipole moment. In the presence of magnetic gradient fields, diamagnetic substances are repelled towards areas of decreasing magnetism.

In the present study, the deposition of <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>substances</b> in patients with brain tumours was evaluated using T 2 relaxometry. A total of 23 patients with untreated tumours or with recurrent tumours following treatment, together {{with a group of}} 19 age-matched healthy controls, were examined using T 2 relaxometry at 3 T. The relaxation times in the basal ganglia, thalamus and white matter were evaluated. Significantly lower T 2 relaxation times were identified in the basal ganglia and thalamus of the patients with tumours, as compared with those of the controls (P< 0. 05). No statistically significant difference was identified between patients with untreated or recurrent brain tumours. The reduction in T 2 relaxation times in the brain tumour patients was possibly caused by the {{accumulation of}} iron, since iron homeostasis is known to be altered in patients with tumours.

40|$|ABSTRACT:: Oxygen {{permeability}} is {{the most}} important parameter of contact lenses, as lack of oxygen causes corneal edema and threatens the vision of the patient. This study was unique in that it used an electron spin resonance (ESR) technique to determine the oxygen diffusion coefficient (D) of contact lenses. Although there are many methods and techniques for investigating oxygen diffusion into contact lenses, ESR was used {{for the first time in}} this study. The ESR technique is based on the scavenging of radicals produced in lenses by oxygen. As a contact lens is not a <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>substance,</b> it cannot give an ESR spectrum. But it does pro-duce an ESR spectrum after irradiation. When a vacuum-irradiated contact lens is exposed to air, the radicals trapped in the lens are transformed into peroxide radicals by the addition of molecular oxygen to the free radicals, and the ESR spectrum begins to change with time. This effect can be used as a tool to measure oxygen uptake in irradiated con-tact lenses. The oxygen diffusion coefficient of a contact lens was determined from changes in ESR signal intensity vary-ing with time. The diffusion coefficients of oxygen for a contact lens were determined for rapid decay [(1. 5 0. 4) 108 cm 2 /s] and slow decay [(1. 3 0. 3) 109 cm 2 /s] in this study.

Signal intensity in {{other regions of the}} brain (putamen, subthalamic area, amygdala etc.) also represents an area of interest. Significant correlations have been shown between blood Mn content, liver enzyme activity, brain MRI changes and signs of parkinsonism in cirrhotic patients. Recently it has been showed that in the diagnostics of HE psychometric tests are as valuable as neuroimaging. The goal of our study was to reveal correlations between signal intensity and severity of HE measured by number connection test part- A. The signal intensity was defined in the areas of globus pallidus, putamen and prefrontal white matter. Some correlations were calculated between PI, HE degree and in blood and 24 hour urine manganese and copper contents. The study covered 17 patients suffering from HE. Hyperintense T 1 signal was revealed in all 17 cases. Maximal signal intensity was obtained in the pallidal area, less- in putamen and very low- in the prefrontal white matter. The brain manganese deposition is explained by the following hypothesis: hyperammonemia and lack of substrate- glutamate leads to the saturation and decrease of glutaminesynthetase activity.

40|$|A {{new model}} {{describing}} the image formation in {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) has been developed. The k-space description of MRI pulse sequences is expanded by introducing new dimensions to describe the phase dispersion due to flow, acceleration, jerk, diffusion and magnetic field inhomogeneities. When the multi-dimensional k-space is combined with a partition model it becomes possible to model the contrast behavior of pulse sequences used in clinical routine. The magnetization created through the interaction between rf pulses and the spin system is handled as separated units, i. e. partitions, and in the present model, a partition is visualized {{as a set of}} parameters rather than a vector sum taken over a collection of spins. A computer application based on the model has been developed, and calculated contrast data show excellent agreement with experimentally measured data generated using a clinical scanner. Furthermore calculated images and 3 -D data sets, showing effects due to flow, movement, diffusion and magnetic field inhomogeneities are in close agreement with results presented in the literature. Also signal calculations of the enhancement induced by the Overhauser effect show good agreement with data from in vitro measurements.

The use of magnetic fields provides another method, which could replace or augment current/traditional approaches, potentially simplifying vehicle operational constraints. The magnetically actuated propellant orientation (MAPO) program effort focused on the use of magnetic fields to control fluid motion as it relates to positioning (i. e. orientation and acquisition) of a <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>substance</b> such as LO 2. Current CFM state- of-the-art systems used to control and acquire propellant in low gravity environments rely on liquid surface tension devices which employ vanes, fine screen mesh channels and baskets. These devices trap and direct propellant to areas where it's needed and have been used routinely with storable (non-cryogenic) propellants. However, almost no data exists r,egarding their operation in cryogenics and the use of such devices confronts designers with a multitude of significant technology issues. Typical problems include a sensitivity to screen dry out (due to thermal loads and pressurant gas) and momentary adverse accelerations (generated from either internal or external sources). Any of these problems can potentially cause the acquisition systems to ingest or develop vapor and fail. The use of lightweight high field strength magnets may offer a valuable means of augmenting traditional systems potentially mitigating or at least easing operational requirements. Two potential uses of magnetic fields include: 1) strategically positioning magnets to keep vent ports clear of liquid (enabling low G vented fill operations), and 2) placing magnets in the center or around the walls of the tank to create an insulating vapor pocket (between the liquid and the tank wall) which could effectively lower heat transfer to the liquid (enabling increased storage time) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} thesis an account or the {{original}} investigations on {{several aspects of}} the dia-and paramagnetism has been given. In the introduction, the results obtained in the present investigations have been briefly discussed {{in the light of}} recent theoretical and experimental work on the subject. 1. During the course of these investigations, the want and accurate {{and at the same time}} quick method for the measurement or the diamagnetic susceptibility of solids and liquid was felt. Gouy's balance was found to be suitable for the purpose. It was modified by enclosing the usual tube inside another tube the inner tube, containing a <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>substance</b> permanently sealed in it, served also as a stopper to the outer tube, which contained the diamagnetic substance. Care was taken that the combined pull was always in the downward direction. This balance. has been fully described in details in chapter I 2. The Magnetic moments of Co++ and Ni++ ions, obtained by the study of pure organic salts, have been found to more or less lie between the two values calculated by the Boss-stoner and the Van vleck formulae, which goes to indicate that there is a partial quenching of the orbital moment. These small variation between the ionic moment values shown by different salts give some idea of the extent, to which the orbital moment is quenches. In the case of cupric copper, both simple and complex compounds have been studied. The complete agreement with the Boss-Stoner value shows the complete absence of any contribution due to the orbital moment. These results are presented in chapters II & III. 3. The method developed by Bhatnagar and his pupils on the assumption that diamagnetic values are completely additive, has been used to calculated the ionic susceptibility of rubidium as well as cuprous ion from the study of their inorganic salts, ions are yet available. The mean ionic susceptibilities and the ionic radii obtained in these two cases compare favourably with those of other workers. The results are given in Chapters IV and V. In the cases of rubidium salts, it has also been found out that temperature has practically no influence on the diamagnetism of the salts in either the dissolved or the solid state. In conformity with the Weidman additive law, the effect of concentration of the salt dissolved in water on the diamagnetic susceptibility has been found to be linear over the range of concentrations studied. The ionic susceptibility of the crystalline state. 4. The low values observed in the case of magnetic susceptibility of cuprous and cobaltous cyandies are more likely in the magnetic measurements or for want of purity of the of the compounds. Thiocyanates studies have susceptibility comparable with those of the other compounds. 5. In Chapter VI and VII are given the atomic susceptibilities constants for monovalent iodine, tetravalent silicon, pentavalent phosphorous, di- and tetravalent sulphur as obtained by using pascalâ€™s atomic susceptibility constants. These compare favourably with the theoretical values of Pauling, Salter and Angus. 6. In chapter VIII, the condition for successful working on the Bauer and Piecardâ€™s U-tube apparatus, in which complicate arise at higher temperatures due to change in the â€˜wettingâ€™ conditions, have been worked out. Neither classical nor quantum theories suggest that diamagnetism should be anything but indo-pendent of temperature. In a number of the common aromatic liquids that have been studied, it has been found that the diamagnetism of aromatic liquids is, in general, independent of temperature. The slight increase observed at higher temperature can be ascribed to the fact that the atmosphere above the menisci of the liquid assumed to the air in calculations must necessarily contain a large percentage of the vapour of the liquid. During the course of further investigations on aliphatic and aromatic iodides, the reverse phenomenon, namely a decrease in diamagnetic with the rise of temperature, has been observed. The anomalous behaviour of iodine in compounds of this type may be responsible for the decrease in diamagnetism at higher temperatures. 7. In Chapter IX, it has been shown that the vapors of when heated above 700 oC, thereby establishing that the become ground paramagnet state of S 2 as well as Se 2 molecules is 3 âˆ‘. On the other hand tellurium vapour remains diamagnetic upto 1100 oC. For working with Te 2 vapour still higher temperatures are need and the electri furnace employed in the present investigation were conducted, spectroscopical investigations had so far not been able to bring about a decision as to whether the ground states of Se 2, Te 2 Seo etc are 1 âˆ‘ or 3 âˆ‘. similar experiments with metallic thallium, given in chapter X, have shown that its vapour become paramagnetic; but at about 1000 oC, it attacks the envelope and again becomes diamagnetic. The diamagnetism at room temperature is associated with the polyatomic solid state and the paramgnetism, with the monoatomic vapour. 8. In chapter XI, a set up for a modified form of Deckerâ€™s balance with arrangements for working at different temperatures is described. Aromatic liquids, organic iodides and rubidium salts in the dissolved state have been investigated on this balance. 9. The authorâ€™s Bhatangar, F. R.

40|$|The susceptibilities and {{specific}} heats of various paramagnetic substances have been measured at temperatures between 20 Â°K and 0. 006 Â°K, {{and the results}} compared with theoretical predictions. In some cases the agreement between theory and experiment {{was found to be}} very good. Susceptibilities were measured by an a. c. method from the change of mutual inductance of a pair of coils surrounding the specimen, using a Hartshorn bridge. This involved the construction of an accurate decade inductometer which is described in full detail. Magnetic specific heats above 1 Â°K were measured in terms of the adiabatic and isothermal susceptibilities, from the ratio of which the specific heat at constant magnetisation can be calculated thermodynamically. These susceptibilities can be measured with the Hartshorn bridge using suitable audio frequencies. The method depends on the mechanism of spin lattice relaxation by means of which the magnetic ions can exchange energy with their surroundings. If the relaxation time is sufficiently long, then the susceptibility measured {{in the presence of a}} large field using the audio frequency method is equal to the adiabatic susceptibility. The isothermic susceptibility is equal to the susceptibility in zero external field for all measuring frequencies. The method measures only the specific heat of the assembly of paramagnetic ions and is independent of the lattice specific heat of the substance. Below 1 Â°K entropies and hence specific heats were measured by the method of adiabatic demagnetization in terms of the magnetic temperature TÂ°. This is defined as TÂ° = Î»/Ï where Ï is the susceptibility, and Î» is determined from measurements in the helium range. The dependence of TÂ° on the shape of the specimen is discussed. The susceptibility or oxygen trapped in a "clathrate" enclosure compound of Î² quinol was measured and the temperature variation between 20 Â°K and 1 Â°K compared with that of an assembly of free oxygen molecules as calculated from spectroscopic data. Almost perfect agreement was found down to 2 Â°K, indicating that the molecules are free to rotate within the cage of quinol. However, below about 2 Â°K a discrepancy was observed suggesting a "freezing in" of the rotation. fThis conclusion was supported by a second experiment on oxygen enrichced in O 16 O 18. The susceptibility of this "gas" at very low temperatures would be expected to differ from that of normal oxygen on the basis of free rotation, but no appreciable difference was found in the range 1 - 5 Â°K. The magnetic specific heat of Cerium Magnesium Nitrate was measured at 1 Â°K by the relaxation method and between 1 Â°K and 0. 006 Â°K by the method of adiabatic demagnetization. It was found that the specific heat is very small, being given in this range of temperatures by C M = 7. 3 x 10 - 6 R/T 2, and that it can be accounted for almost entirely by magnetic dipole-dipole interaction. The uses of the salt for work below 1 Â°K are discussed. Specific heat measurements by the relaxation method were also made on four other substances:- Cerium zinc nitrate. This was found to have very nearly the same properties as the magnesium salt, its susceptibility being exactly the same and its specific heat being given by C M = 6. 4 x 10 - 5 r/t 2. Neodymium magnesium nitrate. The specific heat of this salt was measured at 1 Â°K and found to be given by C M = 8. 73 x 10 - 4 R/T 2, in good agreement with the value calculated on the basis of magnetic dipole-dipole interaction plus the effect of hyperfine splittings. In view of the good agreement between theory and experiment at 1 Â°K, the theory will almost certainly hold down to temperatures of the order of 0. 01 Â°K where the interaction energy becomes comparable with kT. An expression for the deviation from Curie's law in the the temperature range 1 Â°K to 0. 05 Â°K is derived and the uses of the salt for work below 1 Â°K are discussed. Chromic methylamine alum. The value of the specific heat near 1 Â°K was found to be C M = 0. 019 2 R/T 2 in excellent agreement with the values derived from adiabatic demagnetization data. However, when compared with the value calculated from dipole-dipole interaction plus the effect of the Stark splittings it was found that there was a 12 % discrepancy. Possible explanations are discussed but the discrepancy remains unresolved. Ferric Rubidium alum. The value of the specific heat near 1 Â°K was found to be C M = 8. 2 x 10 - 3 R/T 2. This is compared with the value 10. 0 x 10 - 3 R/T 2 deduced from demagnetization experiments, and the value 5. 8 x 10 - 3 R/T 2 calculated from the splittings and the dipole-dipole interactions. Possible explanations for the discrepancy with the theoretical value are discussed. Finally a new method of relating magnetic temperatures below 1 Â°K to absolute temperatures is described. Cerium magnesium nitrate, which is known to obey Curie's law down to 0. 006 Â°K was used as a thermometer since its very anisotropic susceptibility can be measured in the presence of another isotropic <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>substance.</b> The design and construction of a system of mutual inductance coils to measure susceptibilities in two directions at right angles is discussed in detail. The method has been used to determine the T-TÂ° relation for manganous ammonium sulphate from its Curie point to 1 Â°K. The temperature of the Curie point of was identified as 0. 127 Â°KÂ± 0. 003. The advantages of this method over the conventional thermo- dynamic method are discussed with special reference to measurements in the Curie point region. </p...|$|E

[...] The force of a magnet on paramagnetic, diamagnetic, antiferromagnetic materials is usually too weak to be felt, and can be detected only by laboratory instruments, so in everyday life these substances are often described as non-magnetic.|$|R
