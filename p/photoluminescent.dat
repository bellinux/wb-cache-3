2500|$|Optical or {{prismatic}} hand-bearing compass, {{most often}} used by surveyors, but also by cave explorers, foresters, and geologists. These compasses generally use a liquid-damped capsule and magnetized floating compass dial with an integral optical sight, often fitted with built-in <b>photoluminescent</b> or battery-powered illumination. [...] Using the optical sight, such compasses can be read with extreme accuracy when taking bearings to an object, often to fractions of a degree. Most of these compasses are designed for heavy-duty use, with high-quality needles and jeweled bearings, and many are fitted for tripod mounting for additional accuracy.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{compasses}} usually use a magnetized needle or dial {{inside a}} capsule completely {{filled with a}} liquid (lamp oil, mineral oil, white spirits, purified kerosene, or ethyl alcohol is common). While older designs commonly incorporated a flexible rubber diaphragm or airspace inside the capsule to allow for volume changes caused by temperature or altitude, some modern liquid compasses utilize smaller housings and/or flexible capsule materials to accomplish the same result. The liquid inside the capsule serves to damp {{the movement of the}} needle, reducing oscillation time and increasing stability. [...] Key points on the compass, including {{the north end of the}} needle are often marked with phosphorescent, <b>photoluminescent,</b> or self-luminous materials to enable the compass to be read at night or in poor light. [...] As the compass fill liquid is noncompressible under pressure, many ordinary liquid-filled compasses will operate accurately underwater to considerable depths.|$|E
2500|$|Following the bombing, floors {{that were}} blown out {{needed to be}} {{repaired}} to restore the structural support they provided to columns.

50|$|In 2014, Warren {{created a}} {{glow in the}} dark (phosphorescence) table made from <b>photoluminescent</b> powder mixed with clear casting resin set into Pecky Cypress. This table was later republished in Wired UK {{magazine}} in 2015. The video tutorial has over 2.5 million views.|$|E
50|$|Super-LumiNova is a {{brand name}} under which {{strontium}} aluminate-based non-radioactive and nontoxic <b>photoluminescent</b> or afterglow pigments for illuminating markings on watch dials, hands and bezels, etc. in the dark are marketed.

50|$|Strontium {{aluminate}} (SRA, SrAl, 24) {{is a solid}} odorless, nonflammable, pale yellow, monoclinic crystalline powder, {{heavier than}} water. It is chemically and biologically inert. When activated with a suitable dopant (e.g. europium, then it is labeled SrAl2O4:Eu), it acts as a <b>photoluminescent</b> phosphor with long persistence of phosphorescence.|$|E

50|$|At the Sarasota Chalk Festival, the {{featured}} artist Müller, created a 3-D street painting that made history as well. For {{the first time}} in history a street painting was designed to metamorphose, the image changing from day to night from a giant into a fetus in the uterus, through the use of <b>photoluminescent</b> paints. It measured 100’ x 40’.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that photoluminescence spectra can be recorded utilizing a modified PSTM instrument. Coupling PL spectroscopy to PSTM allows the observation of emission from local nanoscopic regions of a sample and provides {{an understanding of how}} the <b>photoluminescent</b> properties of a material change due to surface morphology or chemical differences in an inhomogeneous sample. In this experiment, a 442 nm He-Cd laser beam under TIR was used as an excitation source. The signal from the optical fiber was first passed through a monochromator before reaching a photomultiplier tube to record the signal. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded from local regions of a ruby crystal sample. A subsequent publication successfully demonstrated the use of PSTM to record the fluorescence spectrum of a Cr3+ ion implanted sapphire cryogenically cooled under liquid nitrogen. This technique allows characterization of individual surface features of semiconductor samples whose <b>photoluminescent</b> properties are highly temperature dependent and must be studied at cryogenic temperatures.|$|E
50|$|The {{featured}} {{artist at}} the Sarasota festival, Maestro Madonnaro and Guinness World Record holder, Edgar Mueller, created a three-dimensional (3-D) street painting that made history for introducing {{a new perspective}} in street art that with special equipment {{may be seen in}} three-dimensions. This ground-breaking street painting also appeared to change from a giant by day, to a fetus by night, through the use of <b>photoluminescent</b> paints and artificial lighting. It measured 100’ x 40’.|$|E
50|$|Tritium lumination {{is the use}} of gaseous tritium, a {{radioactive}} isotope of hydrogen, to create visible light. Tritium emits electrons through beta decay and, when they interact with a phosphor material, fluorescent light is created, a process called radioluminescence. As tritium illumination requires no electrical energy, it found wide use in applications such as emergency exit signs and illumination of wristwatches. More recently, many applications using radioactive materials have been replaced with <b>photoluminescent</b> materials.|$|E
5000|$|Some rare-earth {{activated}} SiAlONs are <b>photoluminescent</b> and {{can serve}} as phosphors. Europium(II)-doped β-SiAlON absorbs in ultraviolet and visible light spectrum and emits intense broadband visible emission. Its luminance and color does not change significantly with temperature, due to the temperature-stable crystal structure. It has a great potential as a green down-conversion phosphor for white LEDs; a yellow variant also exists. For white LEDs, a blue LED is used with a yellow phosphor, or with a green and yellow SiAlON phosphor and a red CaAlSiN3-based (CASN) phosphor.|$|E

5000|$|Most recent {{emphasis}} is on {{organic light emitting diodes}} and organic polymer solar cells. The Organic Electronics Association is an international platform to promote applications of organic semiconductors. Conductive polymer products with embedded and improved electromagnetic interference (EMI) and electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection have led to both prototypes and products. For example, Polymer Electronics Research Center at University of Auckland is developing a range of novel DNA sensor technologies based on conducting polymers, <b>photoluminescent</b> polymers and inorganic nanocrystals (quantum dots) for simple, rapid and sensitive gene detection. Typical conductive polymers must be [...] "doped" [...] to produce high conductivity. As of 2001, there remains to be discovered an organic polymer that is intrinsically electrically conducting.|$|E
50|$|Being zero-dimensional, {{quantum dots}} have a sharper {{density of states}} than higher-dimensional structures. As a result, they have {{superior}} transport and optical properties. They have potential uses in diode lasers, amplifiers, and biological sensors. Quantum dots may be excited within a locally enhanced electromagnetic field produced by gold nanoparticles, which can then be observed from the surface plasmon resonance in the <b>photoluminescent</b> excitation spectrum of (CdSe)ZnS nanocrystals. High-quality quantum dots are well suited for optical encoding and multiplexing applications due to their broad excitation profiles and narrow/symmetric emission spectra. The new generations of quantum dots have far-reaching potential {{for the study of}} intracellular processes at the single-molecule level, high-resolution cellular imaging, long-term in vivo observation of cell trafficking, tumor targeting, and diagnostics.|$|E
50|$|A RHEED system {{requires}} an electron source (gun), <b>photoluminescent</b> detector screen and a sample {{with a clean}} surface, although modern RHEED systems have additional parts to optimize the technique. The electron gun generates a beam of electrons which strike the sample at a very small angle relative to the sample surface. Incident electrons diffract from atoms at {{the surface of the}} sample, and {{a small fraction of the}} diffracted electrons interfere constructively at specific angles and form regular patterns on the detector. The electrons interfere according to the position of atoms on the sample surface, so the diffraction pattern at the detector is a function of the sample surface. Figure 1 shows the most basic setup of a RHEED system.|$|E
50|$|The {{range is}} a new {{generation}} of fire extinguisher designed in response to customer demand. Incorporating innovative features, this is the most user-friendly design of fire extinguishers released this century. With a new quick release mechanism and an ergonomically redesigned handle, lever and hose grip, the Chubb range is easier to use and many models offer improved fire ratings.In terms of the safety release mechanism, the traditional ‘pin’ that prevents the extinguisher from being discharged accidentally has been replaced with an Easy-Pull Clip with arrows to show a clear direction of ‘pull’ in order to activate the extinguisher. The <b>photoluminescent</b> version ensures the clip is visible even if the lights fail. When the clip is pulled, the word ‘USED’ then appears.|$|E
5000|$|The CdSe ligand shell {{may contain}} both X type ligands which form {{covalent}} bonds with the metal and L type ligands that form dative bonds. It {{has been shown}} that these ligands can undergo exchange with other ligands. Examples of X type ligands that have been studied in the context of CdSe nanocrystal surface chemistry are sulfides and thiocyanates. Examples of L type ligands that have been studied are amines and phosphines (ref). A ligand exchange reaction in which tributylphosphine ligands were displaced by primary alkylamine ligands on chloride terminated CdSe dots has been reported. [...] Stoichiometry changes were monitored using proton and phosphorus NMR. Photoluminescence properties were also observed to change with ligand moiety. The amine bound dots had significantly higher <b>photoluminescent</b> quantum yields than the phosphine bound dots.|$|E

5000|$|The marine hand compass, or hand-bearing compass {{as it is}} termed in {{nautical}} use, {{has been}} used by small-boat or inshore sailors since at least the 1920s to keep a running course or to record precise bearings to landmarks on shore in order to determine position via the resection technique. [...] Instead of a magnetized needle or disc, most hand bearing compasses feature liquid damping with a floating card design (a magnetized, degreed float or dial atop a jeweled pivot bearing). [...] Equipped with a viewing prism, the hand bearing compass allows instant reading of forward bearings from the user to an object or vessel, and some provide the reciprocal bearing as well. [...] Modern examples of marine hand bearing compasses include the Suunto KB-14 and KB-77, and the Plastimo Iris 50. [...] These compasses frequently have battery-illuminated or <b>photoluminescent</b> degree dials for use in low light or darkness.|$|E

5000|$|Modern {{coupling}} chemistries allow other {{properties of}} polyfluorenes {{to be controlled}} through implementation of complex molecular designs. [...] The above polymer structure pictured has excellent <b>photoluminescent</b> quantum yields (partly due to its fluorene monomer) excellent stability (due to its oxadiazole comonomer) good solubility (due to its many and branched alkyl side chains) and has an amine functionalized side chain for ease of tethering to other molecules or to a substrate.The luminescent color of polyfluorenes can be changed, for example, (from blue to green-yellow) by adding functional groups which participate in excited state intramolecular proton transfer. Exchanging the alkoxy side chains for alcohol side groups allows for energy dissipation (and a red-shift in emission) through reversible transfer of a proton from the alcohol to the nitrogen (on the oxadiazole). These complicated molecular structures were engineered to have these properties and were only able to be realized through careful control of their ordering and side group functionality.|$|E
50|$|While {{pursuing}} {{its mission}} to create cultural events, in 2010, the Avenida de Colores made history by producing {{the first international}} street painting festival in the United States, called the Sarasota Chalk Festival. Street painting festivals started in the United States in 1987, but this festival {{was the first to}} attract many of the best street painting artists {{from all over the world}} to participate. The festival had notable Guinness World Record holders Edgar Mueller from Germany, Leon Keer from Netherlands, and Tracy Lee Stum from the USA. Genna Panzarella from the USA, who was the first woman to receive Italy's honorable Maestra Madonnari title at the International Grazi di Curtatone competition, participated as well as Vera Bugatti from Italy, who also holds the Maestra Madonnari title. Maestro Madonnaro Edgar Mueller created a 100' x 40' 3-D street painting that is the first known contemporary street painting that metamorphosed from one image to another with the change from day to night because the painter used <b>photoluminescent</b> paints. The Sarasota Chalk Festival also was the first street painting festival to have a Halloween-theme for the artists work as well as three over-sized 3-D installations, one of which incorporating two-point perspective.|$|E
