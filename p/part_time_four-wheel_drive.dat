50|$|A {{range of}} engines were {{available}} in the 4th generation vehicles, ranging from 2.0-litre petrol engines to 3.0-litre turbo diesel engines. Most versions are rear-wheel drive, but <b>part</b> <b>time</b> or full <b>time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> versions were sold depending on specification level and market. The base model is typically the DX. Upmarket versions included CD, GL, and super GL models.|$|R
50|$|In September 1972 the <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> (4WD) {{station wagon}} was released, however {{it did not}} appear in the United States until 1974 as a 1975 model. The Leone was {{introduced}} before the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo to emphasize its durability in adverse weather conditions. Up until this <b>time</b> <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> had been limited mainly to off-road vehicles, although the very expensive Jensen FF had been built in limited numbers.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{known as}} the Alfa 33 (Type 905), the 5-door {{hatchback}} was launched in 1983 and a station wagon version (initially badged Giardinetta, later badged Sportwagon) was introduced the following year at the same <b>time</b> as a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> version of the hatchback. The hatchback was styled by Ermanno Cressoni at the Centro Stile Alfa Romeo, while the station wagon was designed by Pininfarina.|$|R
50|$|The Massif is {{fitted with}} a 6-speed ZF 6S400 {{overdrive}} manual gearbox with high and low range ratios. No automatic was available. The Massif also has selectable <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> like its forebear the Land Rover Series (but unlike the Land Rover Defender which has permanent <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive).</b> This was intended to reduce fuel consumption, claimed as “up to 10%” by Iveco. The decision to have selectable <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> {{is believed to be}} because Iveco suggested permanent <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> is unnecessary for the majority of driving conditions. The Massif is usually in four-by-two, rear-wheel <b>drive</b> unless <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> is engaged.|$|R
50|$|The fifth {{generation}} 2011 Ford Explorer (U502) replaced automatic ControlTrac <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> {{with automatic}} Intelligent <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> and Terrain Management.|$|R
50|$|<b>Four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> demand {{increased}} significantly, with Versatile {{becoming one}} of the leaders in <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> development and production. By the late 1970s the Versatile lineup included tractors ranging from 220 to 330 horsepower. With the 1980s came an expanded line of <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> tractors that stretched to 470 horsepower in the Versatile 1150.|$|R
50|$|The 6HP19A is a {{variation}} of the 6HP19 for <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> applications. It was used by the Volkswagen Group for some permanent <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> models.|$|R
50|$|For {{vehicles}} that have partial <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> the term two-wheel drive {{refers to the}} mode when <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> is deactivated and torque is applied to only two wheels.|$|R
50|$|Access to both {{sections}} of the park requires a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> vehicle. <b>Four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> vehicles on Fraser Island need to obtain a vehicle permit. Both sections have numerous camping areas.|$|R
50|$|Audi {{released}} the original Quattro to European customers in late 1980, featuring Audi's quattro permanent <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system (hence its name), {{and the first}} to mate <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> with a turbocharged engine.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{generation}} {{also saw the}} introduction of Super Select 4WD (SS4) as ActivTrak 4WD in some markets, multimode ABS, which were firsts on Japanese <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drives,</b> and electronic shock absorber. SS4 was ground-breaking {{in the sense that}} it combined the advantages of part-time and full-time <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> with four available options: 2H (high-range rear-wheel drive), 4H (high-range full-time <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive),</b> 4HLc (high-range <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> with locked center differential) and 4LLc (low-range <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> with locked center differential). Another advantage of this {{second generation}} system is that it gave the driver the ability to switch between two-wheel <b>drive</b> and full-time <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> at speeds up to 100 km/h (62 mph), whereas the first generation Pajero had to be stationary to switch from rear-wheel <b>drive</b> to <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> (but not from <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> back to rear-wheel drive). In addition to the SS4, an air locking differential was included as factory option. Either 4HLc or 4LLc mode must be engaged to perform this operation. Multimode ABS, on the other hand, was equally innovative. This meant ABS would be fully functional in all modes of SS4, as braking with a locked center differential requires completely different braking parameters. The new electronic shock absorber was also factory option with three settings: S (soft), M (medium), and H (hard). This meant driver can change ride quality and handling depending on road conditions via a switch on center console.|$|R
5000|$|Ford {{introduced}} {{the option of}} the F-Series in <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive.</b> Previously a conversion outsourced to Marmon-Herrington, Ford {{was the first of}} the [...] "big three" [...] U.S. manufacturers to manufacture <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> trucks on its own.|$|R
50|$|The Jensen FF is a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> grand tourer {{produced}} by British car manufacturer Jensen Motors between 1966 and 1971. It {{was the first}} non all-terrain production car equipped with <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> and an anti-lock braking system.|$|R
50|$|The {{gravel road}} is {{accessible}} by all vehicles {{but it would}} be advisable to have a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> (4WD) in wet conditions. The Panhandle Fire Trail is a 9.5 km <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> trail located within the park.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the convertible in 1981, a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> version of the coupé was also added. The <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system was developed by Ferguson Research who also offered it for installation into the Opel Senator/Vauxhall Royale.|$|R
50|$|A new Shift-on-the-move <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> {{system with}} {{two-speed}} dual range New Process 208 aluminium transfer case was introduced on K-Series pickups for the 1981 model year. It replaced the permanent <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system, on pre-1980 models. The shift-on-the-move <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system featured new automatic self locking hubs and synchronized direct high range planetary gearing, {{such that the}} truck could be shifted from two-wheel drive, to fully locked <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> at speeds of up to 25 mph. Once the shift from two-wheel <b>drive</b> to <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> was made, the vehicle could be driven at any forward or reverse speed. Four drive modes were offered: Two High, Four High, Neutral, and Four Low. Two High gave a 0:100 torque split, with Four High yielding a locked 50:50 torque split through direct synchronized gearing. Four Low applied reduction gearing with a 2.61:1 ratio, compared to the previous New Process 205's 1.96:1. The front and rear propeller shafts were locked at all times in Four High and Four Low. Neutral was provided for disengagement of both propeller shafts. Conventional <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> was still available with manual locking hubs.|$|R
50|$|System type: Permanent <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|R
50|$|ControlTrac <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> is {{the brand}} name of a {{selectable}} automatic full-time <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system offered by Ford Motor Company. The <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system was designed and developed at BorgWarner under its TorqTransfer Systems division in the mid 1980s. BorgWarner calls the system Torque-On-Demand (TOD). ControlTrac was the first automatic system to use software control and no planetary or bevel geared center differential. Instead of a planetary or bevel geared center differential, the system uses a variable intelligent locking center multi-disc differential.|$|R

50|$|Gary Porter's brother owned a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> shop in Wadesboro, North Carolina and Porter {{was always}} {{interested}} in <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drives.</b> Porter saw his first monster truck show in 1982 in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1985, Porter built the first Carolina Crusher monster truck for $11,000. Carolina Crusher was initially used to help advertise for his brother's <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> shop with the hope to compete in monster truck shows Porter and Carolina Crusher's first professional appearance occurred at the Spare Time 4x4 Center in Greensboro, North Carolina.|$|R
50|$|Subaru broke {{this pattern}} by {{introducing}} a mass-produced <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> passenger car, after having tested the waters {{by building a}} limited series of <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> FF-1 1300G wagons in 1971. <b>Four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> was Subaru's most notable feature during the 1970s and 1980s, leading to particularly strong sales in places like Switzerland and Colorado. The Leone competed with the Toyota Corolla, Nissan Sunny, Honda Civic, Mazda Familia, Isuzu Gemini, and the Mitsubishi Lancer. The Leone introduced a Subaru tradition of frameless side windows for all models.|$|R
50|$|The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), having {{difficulty}} regulating the quattro <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system, {{and the impact}} it had on the competitors, would eventually ban all <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> cars from competing in 1998, but by then, Audi switched all their works efforts to sports car racing.|$|R
50|$|Versatile was {{the first}} company to mass-produce {{articulated}} <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> tractors, starting in 1966 with the D100 and G100 <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drives.</b> Those ground-breaking tractors were primitive by modern standards, with a 6-cylinder diesel or 8-cylinder gas engine producing 100 horsepower. 1966 models sold for less than CA$10,000.|$|R
5000|$|In some {{traditional}} <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> [...] "off-road" [...] vehicles {{there can be}} a second gear lever which engages a low-ratio gearbox, used on tough terrain. Further, similar-looking levers may switch between two- and <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> or engage differential locks; these are not [...] "gear levers," [...] however.|$|R

5000|$|A rear-wheel <b>drive</b> {{vehicle with}} <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> {{compared}} to a front-wheel <b>drive</b> vehicle with <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> will have a less efficient interior packaging since the transmission is often under the front passenger compartment between the two seats, whereas the latter can package all the components under the hood.|$|R
50|$|ControlTrac II was a Ford <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> {{system based}} on a viscous {{coupling}} unit. The viscous coupling replaced the typical center differential used in <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> applications. The system worked normally in front wheel drive {{but in addition to}} the front wheels being driven, a shaft is powered that runs to the viscous coupling in the rear. If the front wheels slip, the viscous coupling progressively releases torque to the rear wheels. Additionally, the ControlTrac II system provided a mechanical lock of <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> though there was no low range provided by the system.|$|R
