5|$|The {{demands of}} the SA for more {{political}} and military power caused anxiety among military, industrial and <b>political</b> <b>leaders.</b> <b>In</b> response, Hitler purged the entire SA leadership in the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934. Hitler targeted Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders who—along {{with a number of}} Hitler's political adversaries (such as Gregor Strasser and former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher)—were rounded up, arrested and shot.|$|E
5|$|The police {{intervention}} prompted Serb <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>in</b> Okučani to {{urge the}} local population to erect barricades around the town in to pre-empt another interventionstating that police forces were moving in from Kutina and Novska.

5|$|The Pakistani {{government}} was severely criticised for its {{handling of the}} relief operations following the storm, both by local <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>in</b> East Pakistan and in the international media. In the December national elections, the opposition Awami League gained a landslide victory, gaining 160 of the 162 East Pakistani seats. Continuing unrest between East Pakistanis and the central government trigged the Bangladesh Liberation War, which concluded {{with the creation of}} the state of Bangladesh. This {{is one of the first}} times that a natural event helped to trigger a civil war.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Hananu and Alawite revolts, the French {{authorities}} discovered pacifying northern Syria was a more difficult task than pacification of the Damascus region. Following the collapse of the Hananu Revolt, some <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>in</b> Aleppo continued to hope that the Turks would oust the French from northern Syria and unify Aleppo with its Anatolian hinterland, but the withdrawal of Turkish support for the rebels in Syria, following agreements with France, caused a deterioration in Syrian-Turkish ties and left the rebels and nationalists of northern Syria feeling betrayed. Disillusionment with Mustafa Kemal's policies regarding Syria made Turkey's remaining Syrian supporters realign their positions closer to Aleppo's Arab nationalists. In the few years after the revolt, Aleppo's elite largely embraced the concept of a united Syrian struggle for independence from French rule. This shift also began a process of strengthening ties with the leaders of Damascus.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fifth}} book begins, the setting shifts briefly to North America. Following the Ural War, the Japanese had led an Asian {{occupation}} of western North America. The local populations, inspired by Native American beliefs and mythologies, react by leaving the cities for the wilderness and destroying the food factories and cities, eventually driving out the Asian occupation. In America and then globally people begin leaving cities {{in favor of}} the wild. Shamanism and the belief in ghosts reemerge amongst the populace, as does an oral tradition of story-telling. The draining of the cities grows into a settler movement: egalitarian communities that live in nature, characterized by gender equality and sexual liberation. In response to the threat this movement poses to the ruling Senates, <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>in</b> London hatch a plan to colonize Greenland, thereby channeling both the drive for technological innovation and the drive to settle new land.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} June, {{the other}} parties had been intimidated into disbanding. This {{included}} the Nazis' nominal coalition partner, the DNVP; with the SA's help, Hitler forced its leader, Hugenberg, to resign on 29 June. On 14 July 1933, the NSDAP was declared the only legal political party in Germany. The demands of the SA for more political and military power caused anxiety among military, industrial, and <b>political</b> <b>leaders.</b> <b>In</b> response, Hitler purged the entire SA leadership in the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934. Hitler targeted Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders who, along {{with a number of}} Hitler's political adversaries (such as Gregor Strasser and former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher), were rounded up, arrested, and shot. While the international community and some Germans were shocked by the murders, many in Germany believed Hitler was restoring order.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} Bond in 1981 saw media {{reports on the}} more {{politically}} correct Bond and his choice of car—a Saab 900 Turbo; Gardner later {{put him in a}} Bentley Mulsanne Turbo. Gardner also updated Bond's firearm: under Gardner, Bond is initially issued with the Browning 9mm before changing to a Heckler & Koch VP70 and then a Heckler & Koch P7. Bond is also revealed to have taken part in the 1982 Falklands War. Gardner updated Fleming's characters and used contemporary <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>in</b> his novels; he also used the high-tech apparatus of Q Branch from the films, although Jeremy Black observed that Bond is more reliant on technology than his own individual abilities. Gardner's series linked Bond to the Fleming novels rather than the film incarnations and referred to events covered in the Fleming stories.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the early}} <b>political</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>in</b> Singapore did not press for self-government.

The PP wanted eventual self-government, but was too comfortable with the existing situation of cooperating with the British colonial government to set a target date.|$|E
