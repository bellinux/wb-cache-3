25|$|In the phosphatidylinositol signal pathway, the {{extracellular}} signal molecule binds with the G-protein receptor (Gq) {{on the cell}} surface and activates <b>phospholipase</b> <b>C,</b> which {{is located on the}} plasma membrane. The lipase hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two second messengers: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 binds with the IP3 receptor in the membrane of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria to open Ca2+ channels. DAG helps activate protein kinase C (PKC), which phosphorylates many other proteins, changing their catalytic activities, leading to cellular responses.|$|E

The toxin-induced contraction was related to generation of thromboxane A2 from arachidonic acid.

The exact contribution {{of each of these}} enzymes to the termination of 2-AG signaling in vivo is unknown, though it is estimated that MAGL is responsible for ~85% of this activity in the brain.

40|$|In {{response}} to environmental stresses, or during development, plant cells will produce lipids that {{will act as}} intracellular or intercellular mediators. Glycerophospholipid and/or sphingolipid second messengers resulting from the action of lipid metabolizing enzymes (e. g. lipid-kinases or lipases) are commonly found within cells. The importance of such mediating lipids in plants has become increasingly apparent. Responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, and to plant hormones, all appear to involve and require lipid signals. Likewise, developmental processes, in particular polarized growth, seem also to involve signalling lipids. Amongst these lipids, phosphatidic acid (PA) has received the most attention. It can be produced by phospholipases D, but also by diacylglycerol kinases coupled to <b>phospholipases</b> <b>C.</b> Proteins that bind phosphatidic acid, and for which the activity is altered upon binding, have been identified. Furthermore, other lipids are also important in signalling processes.

25|$|The binding of {{melatonin}} to melatonin receptors activates a few signaling pathways. MT1 receptor activation inhibits the adenylyl cyclase and its inhibition {{causes a}} rippling effect of non activation; starting with decreasing formation of {{cyclic adenosine monophosphate}} (cAMP), and then progressing to less protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which in turn hinders the phosphorylation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB binding protein) into P-CREB. MT1 receptors also activate <b>phospholipase</b> <b>C</b> (PLC), affect ion channels and regulate ion flux inside the cell. The binding of melatonin to MT2 receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase which decreases the formation of cAMP. As well it hinders guanylyl cyclase and therefore the forming of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Binding to MT2 receptors probably affects PLC which increases protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Activation of the receptor can lead to ion flux inside the cell.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the subset of potassium channels that are directly gated by G proteins, G proteins can also directly gate certain calcium ion channels in neuronal cell membranes. Although membrane ion channels and protein phosphorylation are typically indirectly affected by G protein-coupled receptors via effector proteins (such as <b>phospholipase</b> <b>C</b> and adenylyl cyclase) and second messengers (such as inositol triphosphate, diacylglycerol and cyclic AMP), G proteins can short circuit the second-messenger pathway and gate the ion channels directly. Such bypassing of the second-messenger pathways is observed in mammalian cardiac myocytes and associated sarcolemmal vesicles in which Ca2+ channels are able to survive and function {{in the absence of}} cAMP, ATP or protein kinase C when {{in the presence of the}} activated α-subunit of the G protein. For example, Gα, which is stimulatory to adenylyl cyclase, acts on the Ca2+ channel directly as an effector. This short circuit is membrane-delimiting, allowing direct gating of calcium channels by G proteins to produce effects more quickly than the cAMP cascade could. This direct gating has also been found in specific Ca2+ channels in the heart and skeletal muscle T tubules.|$|E
500|$|Bacteria have {{developed}} ways to survive inside phagocytes, where {{they continue to}} evade the immune system.

Other pathogens, such as Leishmania, create a highly modified vacuole inside the phagocyte, which helps them persist and replicate. Some bacteria are capable of living inside of the phagolysosome. Staphylococcus aureus, for example, produces the enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, which break down chemicals—such as hydrogen peroxide—produced by phagocytes to kill bacteria.
