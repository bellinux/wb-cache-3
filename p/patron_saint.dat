5|$|When consecrated in 1435 by Archbishop Olaus Laurentii, {{the cathedral}} still was not complete.

5|$|According to legend, in 832 A.D. Óengus II led {{an army of}} Picts and Scots {{into battle}} against the Angles, led by Æthelstan, near modern-day Athelstaneford, East Lothian. The legend states that whilst engaged in prayer {{on the eve of}} battle, Óengus vowed that if granted victory he would appoint Saint Andrew as the <b>Patron</b> <b>Saint</b> of Scotland; Andrew then {{appeared}} to Óengus that night in a dream and assured him of victory. On the morning of battle white clouds forming the shape of an X were said to have appeared in the sky. Óengus and his combined force, emboldened by this apparent divine intervention, took to the field and despite being inferior in terms of numbers were victorious. Having interpreted the cloud phenomenon as representing the crux decussata upon which Saint Andrew was crucified, Óengus honoured his pre-battle pledge and duly appointed Saint Andrew as the <b>Patron</b> <b>Saint</b> of Scotland. The white saltire set against a celestial blue background {{is said to have been}} adopted as the design of the flag of Scotland on the basis of this legend.|$|E
