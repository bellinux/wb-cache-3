The analysis of a coral core, derived from a Porites lutea head from Sodwana Bay, covering the last 116 years, indicated higher frequency climatic fluctuations over the last century. Climatic variability on the long- and short-term could then be related to known atmospheric processes through application of the Tyson (1986) model for southern Africa atmospheric circulation.

40|$|The Coexistence Approach {{has been}} used to infer <b>palaeoclimates</b> for many Eurasian fossil plant assemblages. However, the theory that underpins the method has never been {{examined}} in detail. Here we discuss acknowledged and implicit assumptions and assess the statistical nature and pseudo-logic of the method. We also compare the Coexistence Approach theory with the active field of species distribution modelling. We argue that the assumptions will inevitably be violated to some degree and that the method lacks any substantive means to identify or quantify these violations. The absence of a statistical framework makes the method highly vulnerable to the vagaries of statistical outliers and exotic elements. In addition, we find numerous logical inconsistencies, such as how climate shifts are quantified (the use of a "centre value" of a coexistence interval) and the ability to reconstruct "extinct" climates from modern plant distributions. Given the problems that have surfaced in species distribution modelling, accurate and precise quantitative reconstructions of <b>palaeoclimates</b> (or even climate shifts) using the nearest-living-relative principle and rectilinear niches (the basis of the method) will not be possible. The Coexistence Approach can be summarised as an exercise that shoehorns a plant fossil assemblage into coexistence and then assumes that this must be the climate. Given the theoretical issues and methodological issues highlighted elsewhere, we suggest that the method be discontinued and that all past reconstructions be disregarded and revisited using less fallacious methods. We outline six steps for (further) validation of available and future taxon-based methods and advocate developing (semi-quantitative) methods that prioritise robustness over precision...|$|R

Similarly, the tropics, spanning 46 ° of latitude in two hemispheres on three continents, do not respond uniformly to a given forcing.

40|$|Future {{environmental}} {{planning and management}} is dependent upon knowledge of <b>palaeoclimates,</b> which requires inference from high-resolution proxy indicators. Testate amoebae are abundant in ombrotrophic peatland and are good proxy indicators of Holocene palaeoenvironmental change. The recognised link between peatland, hydrology and climate greatly influences the distribution of microorganisms such as testate amoebae. Modem data conceming the testate amoebae taxa-hydrology relationship is needed to model transfer functions and reconstmct <b>palaeoclimates</b> using fossil data. The use of experimental microcosms for ecological research holds great potential for understanding of this relationship. The principle {{aim of this study}} involved testing the use experimental microcosms for determining hydrological tolerances and optima of common testate amoebae taxa. Samples were collected from a typical raised mire located within Northumberland National Park (UK). Methodology involved assigning a number of Sphagnum peat moss samples to three microcosm water table treatments. Sub-samples were taken from the microcosms before, after and mid-way through a ten-week experimental period in order to observe changes to the species assemblage in response to the different water table treatments. Results revealed a very low testate amoebae survival rate, however, a number of problems were encountered conceming the methodology and identification of the living population. Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) indicated that the testate amoebae species assemblages responded to the manipulated water tables, this involved the changing frequency of a number of key species throughout the experimental period. It may be possible to observe statistically significant results if the experimental period was extended and the living population was more clearly identifiable. This research has demonsfrated that there is potential for experimental microcosms in studying the modem ecology of testate amoebae and future work employing such methodology may improve the use of this proxy, thus providing enhanced palaeoreconstructions.
