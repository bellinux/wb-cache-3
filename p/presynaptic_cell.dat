5|$|Retrograde {{signaling}} {{is currently}} a contentious subject as some investigators {{do not believe the}} <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell</b> contributes at all to the expression of LTP. Even among proponents of the hypothesis there is controversy over the identity of the messenger. Early thoughts focused on nitric oxide, while most recent evidence points to cell adhesion proteins.|$|E
5|$|Retrograde {{signaling}} is {{a hypothesis}} {{that attempts to}} explain that, while LTP is induced and expressed postsynaptically, some evidence {{suggests that it is}} expressed presynaptically as well. The hypothesis gets its name because normal synaptic transmission is directional and proceeds from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic cell. For induction to occur postsynaptically and be partially expressed presynaptically, a message must travel from the postsynaptic cell to the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell</b> in a retrograde (reverse) direction. Once there, the message presumably initiates a cascade of events that leads to a presynaptic component of expression, such as the increased probability of neurotransmitter vesicle release.|$|E
5|$|The {{identities of}} only a few {{proteins}} synthesized during L-LTP are known. Regardless of their identities, it is thought that they contribute to the increase in dendritic spine number, surface area, and postsynaptic sensitivity to neurotransmitter associated with L-LTP expression. The latter may be brought about in part by the enhanced synthesis of AMPA receptors during L-LTP. Late LTP is also associated with the presynaptic synthesis of synaptotagmin and an increase in synaptic vesicle number, suggesting that L-LTP induces protein synthesis not only in postsynaptic cells, but in presynaptic cells as well. As mentioned previously, for postsynaptic LTP induction to result in presynaptic protein synthesis, there must be communication from the postsynaptic to the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell.</b> This may occur via the synthesis of a retrograde messenger, discussed later.|$|E
40|$|SummaryRetrograde {{signals from}} postsynaptic targets are {{critical}} during development and plasticity of synaptic connections. These signals serve {{to adjust the}} activity of <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cells</b> according to postsynaptic cell outputs and to maintain synaptic function within a dynamic range. Despite their importance, the mechanisms that trigger the release of retrograde signals {{and the role of}} <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cells</b> in this signaling event are unknown. Here we show that a retrograde signal mediated by Synaptotagmin 4 (Syt 4) is transmitted to the postsynaptic cell through anterograde delivery of Syt 4 via exosomes. Thus, by transferring an essential component of retrograde signaling through exosomes, <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cells</b> enable retrograde signaling...|$|R
50|$|VMAT is a main {{target of}} methamphetamine. Studies {{indicate}} that substituted amphetamines including methamphetamine interact with VMAT2 at the TBZ/DTBZOH binding site/conformation. By {{acting as a}} competitive antagonist, methamphetamine blocks the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell's</b> ability to use VMAT for vesicular packaging.|$|R
50|$|He was an {{advocate}} {{of the existence of}} dendritic spines, although he did not recognize them as the site of contact from <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cells.</b> He was a proponent of polarization of nerve cell function and his student, Rafael Lorente de Nó, would continue this study of input-output systems into cable theory and some of the earliest circuit analysis of neural structures.|$|R
25|$|The {{neurotransmitter}} {{is either}} reabsorbed by the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell,</b> and then repackaged for future release, or else it is broken down metabolically.|$|E
25|$|Chemical synapses pass {{information}} directionally from a <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell</b> to a {{postsynaptic cell}} {{and are therefore}} asymmetric in structure and function. The presynaptic terminal, or synaptic bouton, is a specialized area within the axon of the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell</b> that contains neurotransmitters enclosed in small membrane-bound spheres called synaptic vesicles (as {{well as a number}} of other supporting structures and organelles, such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum). Synaptic vesicles are docked at the presynaptic plasma membrane at regions called active zones.|$|E
25|$|The {{process begins}} {{with a wave of}} {{electrochemical}} excitation called an action potential traveling along the membrane of the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell,</b> until it reaches the synapse.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} reveals that layer II/III {{pyramidal}} cells, firing {{in a high}} oscillatory regime in the gamma-frequency range (20 Hz and 40 Hz) are able to discriminate between <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cells</b> oscillating in phase and <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cells</b> oscillating out of phase. Synaptic connections between cells oscillating in phase tend to be strengthened, whereas connections between out of phase oscillating cells get depressed. The time windows for this differential synaptic regulation are defined by the precise phase relation of incoming inputs to the oscillatory Vm modulation. The phase angle sensitivity of Hebbian modifications depends on the activation of NMDA-receptors and is dramatically affected by neuromodulation. The activation of cholinergic receptors {{is a prerequisite for}} the bidirectional regulation of synaptic inputs, coincident activity leading to synaptic potentiation and phase-lagged activity to synaptic depression. Cholinergic receptor blockade and activation of beta-adrenergic receptors result in phase-insensitive synaptic depression. Finally, the sinusoidal Vm modulation seems to play a crucial role for the phase angle sensitivity of Hebbian modifications...|$|R
40|$|Isolated taste cells, {{taste buds}} and strips of lingual tissue from taste {{papillae}} secrete ATP upon taste stimulation. Taste bud receptor (Type II) cells {{have been identified}} as the source of ATP secretion. Based on studies on isolated taste buds and single taste cells, we have postulated that ATP secreted from receptor cells via pannexin 1 hemichannels acts within the taste bud to excite neighbouring <b>presynaptic</b> (Type III) <b>cells.</b> This hypothesis, however, remains to be tested in intact tissues. In this report we used confocal Ca 2 + imaging and lingual slices containing intact taste buds to test the hypothesis of purinergic signalling between taste cells in a more integral preparation. Incubating lingual slices with apyrase reversibly blocked cell-to-cell communication between receptor <b>cells</b> and <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cells,</b> consistent with ATP being the transmitter. Inhibiting pannexin 1 gap junction hemichannels with CO 2 -saturated buffer or probenecid significantly reduced cell–cell signalling between receptor <b>cells</b> and <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cells.</b> In contrast, anandamide, a blocker of connexin gap junction channels, had no effect of cell-to-cell communication in taste buds. These findings are consistent with the model for peripheral signal processing via ATP and pannexin 1 hemichannels in mammalian taste buds...|$|R
40|$|When {{a typical}} nerve cell is {{injected}} with enough current, it fires a regular stream of action potentials. But cortical cells in vivo usually fire irregularly, reflecting synaptic input from <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cells</b> {{as well as}} intrinsic biophysical properties. We have applied the theory of stochastic processes to spike trains recorded from cortical neurons (Tuckwell 1989) and find a fundamental contradiction between the large interspike variability observed and the much lower values predicted by well-accepted biophysical models of single cells...|$|R
25|$|Synapses may be {{described}} as symmetric or asymmetric. When examined under an electron microscope, asymmetric synapses are characterized by rounded vesicles in the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell,</b> and a prominent postsynaptic density. Asymmetric synapses are typically excitatory. Symmetric synapses in contrast have flattened or elongated vesicles, and do not contain a prominent postsynaptic density. Symmetric synapses are typically inhibitory.|$|E
25|$|Sourness is acidity, and, like salt, it is a taste sensed using ion channels. Undissociated acid diffuses {{across the}} plasma {{membrane}} of a <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell,</b> where it dissociates {{in accordance with}} Le Chatelier's principle. The protons that are released then block potassium channels, which depolarise the cell and cause calcium influx. In addition, the taste receptor PKD2L1 {{has been found to}} be involved in tasting sour.|$|E
25|$|Selective {{serotonin}} reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) {{are believed}} to increase the extracellular level of the neurotransmitter serotonin by limiting its reabsorption into the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell,</b> increasing the level of serotonin in the synaptic cleft available to bind to the postsynaptic receptor. They have varying degrees of selectivity for the other monoamine transporters, with pure SSRIs having only weak affinity for the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters.|$|E
50|$|Monoamine {{transporters}} {{are members}} of the group of Na +/Cl − -dependent substrate-specific neuronal membrane transporters belonging to the SLC6 gene family. MATs are large integral membrane proteins composed of 12 transmembrane domains connected by intracellular and extracellular loops. The NH2 and COOH termini of the MAT proteins are located within the cytoplasm of <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cells.</b> All MATs contain sites for protein kinase phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C (PKC) and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase.|$|R
5000|$|Hebbian {{theory is}} a theory in {{neuroscience}} that proposes {{an explanation for the}} adaptation of neurons in the brain during the learning process, describing a basic mechanism for synaptic plasticity, where an increase in synaptic efficacy arises from the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell's</b> repeated and persistent stimulation of the postsynaptic cell. Introduced by Donald Hebb in his 1949 book The Organization of Behavior, the theory is also called Hebb's rule, Hebb's postulate, and cell assembly theory. Hebb states it as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|Retrograde transneuronal {{degeneration}} is degeneration {{caused by}} loss of trophic {{support from the}} target. It occurs in <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cells</b> that are sending inputs to injured postsynaptic cells. [...] It is often termed [...] "dying backward." [...] This type of degeneration {{can be seen in}} Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Loss of Betz cells is a variable effect of this disease but the loss of these cells in this disease demonstrates the “dying-back” (axonopathy) due to the changes in upper motor neurons.|$|R
25|$|At a {{chemical}} synapse, one neuron releases neurotransmitter molecules {{into a small}} space (the synaptic cleft) that is adjacent to another neuron. The neurotransmitters are kept within small sacs called vesicles, and are released into the synaptic cleft by exocytosis. These molecules then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell's side of the synaptic cleft. Finally, the neurotransmitters must be cleared from the synapse through one of several potential mechanisms including enzymatic degradation or re-uptake by specific transporters either on the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell</b> or possibly by neuroglia to terminate {{the action of the}} transmitter.|$|E
25|$|Long-lasting {{changes in}} the {{efficacy}} of synaptic connections (long-term potentiation, or LTP) between two neurons can involve the making and breaking of synaptic contacts. Genes such as activin ß-A, which encodes a subunit of activin A, are up-regulated during early stage LTP. The activin molecule modulates the actin dynamics in dendritic spines through the MAP-kinase pathway. By changing the F-actin cytoskeletal structure of dendritic spines, spines are lengthened and the chance that they make synaptic contacts with the axonal terminals of the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell</b> is increased. The end result is long-term maintenance of LTP.|$|E
500|$|Once in the synapse, {{dopamine}} binds to and activates dopamine receptors. These can be postsynaptic dopamine receptors, {{which are}} located on dendrites (the postsynaptic neuron), or presynaptic autoreceptors (e.g., the D2sh and presynaptic D3 receptors), which {{are located on}} the membrane of an axon terminal (the presynaptic neuron). [...] After the postsynaptic neuron elicits an action potential, dopamine molecules quickly become unbound from their receptors. They are then absorbed back into the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell,</b> via reuptake mediated either by the dopamine transporter or by the plasma membrane monoamine transporter. Once back in the cytosol, dopamine can either be broken down by a monoamine oxidase or repackaged into vesicles by VMAT2, making it available for future release.|$|E
40|$|Neurons in sensory systems often pool inputs over {{arrays of}} <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cells,</b> {{giving rise to}} {{functional}} subunits inside a neuron’s receptive field. The organization of these subunits provides a signature of the neuron’s presynaptic functional connectivity and determines how the neuron integrates sensory stimuli. Here we introduce the method of spike-triggered non-negative matrix factorization for detecting the layout of subunits within a neuron’s receptive field. The method only requires the neuron’s spiking responses under finely structured sensory stimulation and is therefore applicable to large populations of simultaneously recorded neurons. Applied to recordings from ganglion cells in the salamander retina, the method retrieves the receptive fields of <b>presynaptic</b> bipolar <b>cells,</b> as verified by simultaneous bipolar and ganglion cell recordings. The identified subunit layouts allow improved predictions of ganglion cell responses to natural stimuli and reveal shared bipolar cell input into distinct types of ganglion cells...|$|R
40|$|Serine {{racemase}} (SR) generates d-serine, a coagonist with glutamate at NMDA receptors. We {{show that}} SR is physiologically S-nitrosylated leading to marked inhibition of enzyme activity. Inhibition involves {{interactions with the}} cofactor ATP reflecting juxtaposition of the ATP-binding site and cysteine- 113 (C 113), the site for physiological S-nitrosylation. NMDA receptor physiologically enhances SR S-nitrosylation by activating neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS). These findings support a model whereby postsynaptic stimulation of nitric-oxide (NO) formation feeds back to <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cells</b> to S-nitrosylate SR and decrease d-serine availability to postsynaptic NMDA receptors...|$|R
30|$|Synaptic {{depression}} as a regulator of synaptic {{transmission is}} discussed thoroughly in [6]. Here {{it is supposed}} that synaptic depression can keep synaptic efficacy constant relative to changes in probability of release. Also, depressing synapses {{can serve as a}} gain control in the face of rapidly firing <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cells.</b> It is also established that synaptic depression favors temporal encoding of information because the steady state is reached quickly and maintains no information as regards the absolute firing rate. However, these synapses are sensitive to a sudden change in firing rate, detecting rate changes in low- and high-frequency inputs with similar sensitivity.|$|R
500|$|While {{the above}} model of E-LTP {{describes}} entirely postsynaptic mechanisms for induction, maintenance, and expression, an additional component of expression may occur presynaptically. One hypothesis of this presynaptic facilitation is that persistent CaMKII {{activity in the}} postsynaptic cell during E-LTP {{may lead to the}} synthesis of a [...] "retrograde messenger", discussed later. According to this hypothesis, the newly synthesized messenger travels across the synaptic cleft from the postsynaptic to the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell,</b> leading to a chain of events that facilitate the presynaptic response to subsequent stimuli. Such events may include an increase in neurotransmitter vesicle number, probability of vesicle release, or both. In addition to the retrograde messenger underlying presynaptic expression in early LTP, the retrograde messenger may also {{play a role in the}} expression of late LTP.|$|E
2500|$|These {{proteins}} change shape, {{causing the}} membranes of some [...] "docked" [...] vesicles to fuse with the membrane of the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell,</b> thereby opening the vesicles and dumping their neurotransmitter contents into the synaptic cleft, the narrow {{space between the}} membranes of the pre- and postsynaptic cells.|$|E
2500|$|Some synapses {{dispense}} with the [...] "middleman" [...] of the neurotransmitter, and connect the presynaptic and postsynaptic cells together. When an action potential reaches such a synapse, the ionic currents {{flowing into the}} <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell</b> can cross the barrier of the two cell membranes and enter the postsynaptic cell through pores known as connexons. [...] Thus, the ionic currents of the presynaptic action potential can directly stimulate the postsynaptic cell. [...] Electrical synapses allow for faster transmission {{because they do not}} require the slow diffusion of neurotransmitters across the synaptic cleft. Hence, electrical synapses are used whenever fast response and coordination of timing are crucial, as in escape reflexes, the retina of vertebrates, and the heart.|$|E
50|$|In postsynaptic cells, {{neurotransmitter}} receptors receive {{signals that}} trigger an electrical signal, by regulating {{the activity of}} ion channels. The influx of ions through ion channels opened due to the binding of neurotransmitters to specific receptors can change the membrane potential of a neuron. This {{can result in a}} signal that runs along the axon (see action potential) and is passed along at a synapse to another neuron and possibly on to a neural network. On <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cells,</b> there can be receptor sites specific to the neurotransmitters released by that cell (see Autoreceptor), which provide feedback and mediate excessive neurotransmitter release from it.|$|R
50|$|Spatial {{summation}} is {{a mechanism}} of eliciting an action potential in a neuron with input from multiple <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cells.</b> It is the algebraic summing of potentials from {{different areas of}} input, usually on the dendrites. Summation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials increases {{the probability that the}} potential will reach the threshold potential and generate an action potential, whereas summation of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials can prevent the cell from achieving an action potential. The closer the dendritic input is to the axon hillock, the more the potential will influence the probability of the firing of an action potential in the postsynaptic cell.|$|R
40|$|The {{visual system}} {{continually}} adjusts its sensitivity, or ‘adapts’, {{to the conditions}} of the immediate environment. Adaptation increases responses when input signals are weak, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and decreases responses when input signals are strong, to prevent response saturation. Retinal ganglion cells adapt primarily to two properties of light input: the mean intensity and the variance of intensity over time (contrast). This review focuses on cellular mechanisms for contrast adaptation in mammalian retina. High contrast over the ganglion cell's receptive field centre reduces the gain of spiking responses. The mechanism for gain control arises partly in <b>presynaptic</b> bipolar <b>cell</b> inputs and partly in the process of spike generation. Following strong contrast stimulation, ganglion cells exhibit a prolonged after-hyperpolarization, driven primarily by suppression of glutamate release from <b>presynaptic</b> bipolar <b>cells.</b> Ganglion cells also adapt to high contrast over their peripheral receptive field. Long-range adaptive signals are carried by amacrine cells that inhibit the ganglion cell directly, causing hyperpolarization, and inhibit presynaptic bipolar terminals, reducing gain of their synaptic output. Thus, contrast adaptation in ganglion cells involves multiple synaptic and intrinsic mechanisms for gain control and hyperpolarization. Several forms of adaptation in ganglion <b>cells</b> originate in <b>presynaptic</b> bipolar <b>cells...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Nonsynaptic {{neuronal}} {{areas such}} as the axon also have inherent qualities that affect the synapse. [...] These essential mechanisms include the delay in depolarization that action potential undergoes while traveling down the axon. [...] This intrinsic quality slows the propagation of action potentials and is due to the movement of depolarizing current down the cytoplasm and the intermittent placement of sodium channels on the Nodes of Ranvier. [...] These mechanisms always exist, but may change depending on the conditions of the cell soma, axon, and dendrites at the time. Therefore, latency, or delay in propagation of action potentials or EPSPs, can be variable. [...] Every excitatory postsynaptic potential that is propagated to a postsynaptic cell is first transmitted through the action potential down the axon in the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell,</b> and thus nonsynaptic plasticity inherently affects synaptic plasticity.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{downstream}} {{effects of}} active TAAR1 {{is to increase}} cAMP in the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell</b> via Gαs G-protein activation of adenylyl cyclase. This alone can have a multitude of cellular consequences. A main function of the cAMP may be to up-regulate the expression of trace amines in the cell cytoplasm. These amines would then activate intracellular TAAR1. Monoamine autoreceptors (e.g., D2 short, presynaptic α2, and presynaptic 5-HT1A) have the opposite effect of TAAR1, and together these receptors provide a regulatory system for monoamines. Notably, amphetamine and trace amines possess high binding affinities for TAAR1, but not for monoamine autoreceptors. The effect of TAAR1 agonists on monoamine transporters in the brain appears to be site-specific. Imaging studies indicate that monoamine reuptake inhibition by amphetamine and trace amines is dependent upon the presence of TAAR1 [...] in the associated monoamine neurons. [...] As of 2010, [...] of TAAR1 and the dopamine transporter (DAT) has been visualized in rhesus monkeys, but [...] of TAAR1 with the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the serotonin transporter (SERT) has only been evidenced by messenger RNA (mRNA) expression.|$|E
2500|$|Neurons are {{electrically}} excitable cells composed, in general, {{of one or}} more dendrites, {{a single}} soma, a single axon and one or more axon terminals. Dendrites are cellular projections whose primary function is to receive synaptic signals. Their protrusions, or spines, are designed to capture the neurotransmitters released by the presynaptic neuron. They have a high concentration of ligand-gated ion channels. These spines have a thin neck connecting a bulbous protrusion to the dendrite. This ensures that changes occurring inside the spine are less likely to affect the neighboring spines. The dendritic spine can, with rare exception (see LTP), act as an independent unit. The dendrites extend from the soma, which houses the nucleus, and many of the [...] "normal" [...] eukaryotic organelles. Unlike the spines, the surface of the soma is populated by voltage activated ion channels. These channels help transmit the signals generated by the dendrites. Emerging out from the soma is the axon hillock. This region is characterized by having a very high concentration of voltage-activated sodium channels. In general, it is considered to be the spike initiation zone for action potentials. Multiple signals generated at the spines, and transmitted by the soma all converge here. Immediately after the axon hillock is the axon. This is a thin tubular protrusion traveling away from the soma. The axon is insulated by a myelin sheath. Myelin is composed of either Schwann cells (in the peripheral nervous system) or oligodendrocytes (in the central nervous system), both of which are types of glial cells. Although glial cells are not involved with the transmission of electrical signals, they communicate and provide important biochemical support to neurons. To be specific, myelin wraps multiple times around the axonal segment, forming a thick fatty layer that prevents ions from entering or escaping the axon. This insulation prevents significant signal decay as well as ensuring faster signal speed. This insulation, however, has the restriction that no channels can be present {{on the surface of the}} axon. There are, therefore, regularly spaced patches of membrane, which have no insulation. These nodes of Ranvier can be considered to be [...] "mini axon hillocks", as their purpose is to boost the signal in order to prevent significant signal decay. At the furthest end, the axon loses its insulation and begins to branch into several axon terminals. These presynaptic terminals, or synaptic boutons, are a specialized area within the axon of the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cell</b> that contains neurotransmitters enclosed in small membrane-bound spheres called synaptic vesicles.|$|E

50|$|Antidepressants have {{short-term}} and long-term effects in depressed patients. The short-term effects are explained by a hypothesis that states that depression is acutely {{brought on by}} an immediate decrease in catecholamines in the brain. Antidepressants act immediately to inhibit this decrease and restore normal levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain. Under stressed conditions, vesicle exocytosis is potentiated and a release of catecholamines causes depression of <b>presynaptic</b> <b>cells</b> because of depleted neurotransmitters. Therapeutic doses of fluoxetine {{have been shown to}} decrease these neuronal fatigue states by inhibiting vesicle release and thereby preventing synaptic fatigue in hippocampal neurons. These findings show that fluoxetine as well as other antidepressants that act through the same mechanisms as fluoxetine enhance neurorecovery and neurotransmission {{to reduce the risk of}} depression.|$|R
