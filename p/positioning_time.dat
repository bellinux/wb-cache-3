30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Fig. 8 that among the four {{different}} shape models, the 10 positioning times of the square and circular models are generally relatively small. In this paper, the time average of the positioning calculation of each model is calculated according to the data of Fig.  8. The result shows that the average <b>positioning</b> <b>time</b> of the square is 8850  ms, the average <b>positioning</b> <b>time</b> of the circle is 8860  ms, the average <b>positioning</b> <b>time</b> of the triangle is 9700  ms, and the <b>positioning</b> <b>time</b> of the regular hexagon is 9630  ms.

40|$|Abstract—Disk drives are {{a common}} {{performance}} bottleneck in modern storage systems. To alleviate this, disk manufacturers employ a variety of I/O request scheduling strategies which aim to reduce disk head <b>positioning</b> <b>time</b> by dynamically reordering queueing requests. An analytical model of this phenomenon is best represented by an M/G/ 1 queue with queue length dependent service times. However, there is no general exact result for the response time distribution of this variety of queue with generalised service time distributions. In this paper, we present a novel approximation for the response time distribution of such a queue. We then apply this method to the specific case of a zoned disk drive which implements I/O request reordering. A key contributionisthederivationofrealisticservicetimedistributions with minimised <b>positioning</b> <b>time.</b> We derive analytical results for calculating not only the mean but also higher moments and the full distribution of I/O request response time.

40|$|Purpose To {{improve and}} {{accelerate}} patient positioning during proton treatment of eye tumours using an automated monitoring procedure Methods and Materials Proton therapy of eye tumours requires positioning in the sub millimetre range. For this purpose, small tantalum clips sutured {{to the eye}} globe serve as landmarks. While the patient is immobilised in the treatment chair and keeps looking at a fixation light, clip and eye positions can be determined with a digital X amp; 64979;ray system providing orthogonal images. The clip projections derived from the treatment plan are superimposed with the present X ray images for position control. By the correction of chair and fixation light coordinates the patient is repositioned until both actual and target clip projections match with each other. In order to avoid a time consuming trial and error correction approach, a novel procedure has been implemented in the image processing software that compares both projections with each other. By automatically calculating the necessary corrections of chair and light coordinates it is aimed to facilitate adjustment to the final treatment position. Results Perpendicular X ray views provided precise patient positioning with an accuracy of below 0. 3 mm. By use of the automated procedure, the mean <b>positioning</b> <b>time</b> could be reduced. Discussion and Conclusions To date, the installation of an on amp; 64979;site digital X ray system for patient positioning is unique in proton therapy.

The main goal {{of this study is to}} propose the parameter which can be used for selection of stable and unstable sources from analysis of source <b>positions</b> <b>time</b> series.

Fifteen subjects without disabilities and ten subjects with disabilities received neck range of motion evaluations and per-formed computer exercises using head controls.

One way to correct the resulting speed mismatch is to stripe data across many disks. In this paper, we address how to stripe data to get maximum performance from the disks. Specifically, we examine how to choose the striping unit, i. e. the amount of logically contiguous data on each disk. We synthesize rules for determining the best striping unit for a given range of workloads. We show how the choice of striping unit depends on only two parameters: 1) the number of outstanding requests in the disk system at any given time, and 2) the average <b>positioning</b> <b>time</b> × data transfer rate of the disks. We derive an equation for the optimal striping unit {{as a function of}} these two parameters; we also show how to choose the striping unit without prior knowledge about the workload...|$|E

This model, although relatively simple, predicts performance on several platforms to within 12 % for I/O sizes in the range 16 [...] 128 KB/s.
