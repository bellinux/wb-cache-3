Municipal sewage sludge stabilized during anaerobic digestion, taken from Wastewater Treatment Plant Jamno. The dewatering process was aided by cationic flocculant Praestol 855 BS of real solution concentration 0. 3 % and essential oil from orange, which was extracted from orange peels {{in the process of}} steam distillation. Constant parameters <b>of</b> <b>dewatering</b> process were: pH, temperature, colour, texture, smell, water content and dry matter content. Independent variables <b>of</b> <b>dewatering</b> process were: centrifugation time (in the range 1 – 10 min), centrifugation speed (in the range 1000 – 3000 rotations/min) and dose of mixture of flocculant Praestol 855 BS (79 %) + essential oil of orange (21 %) in the range 0 – 48 ml/dm 3. Water content in the sludge after the process, dry matter content in the effluent and the duration of the smell of oil in the sediment were determined.

40|$|Australian product coals are {{becoming}} finer-grained, mainly due to {{improvements in the}} performance of ultra-fine coal recovery methods. The finer the product coal size fraction, the more capacity it has to store water during beneficiation and the higher the pressure required to facilitate dewatering to meet the specified moisture. Following the removal of the pressure applied to facilitate dewatering, the particular product coal size fraction is left under a suction equivalent to that applied pressure, providing it with the potential to re-wet on the stockpile under moist conditions. During the dewatering process, the product coal is unsaturated. The relationship between applied pressure (or the equivalent suction felt on the removal of this pressure) and moisture content for a particular product coal size fraction is described by the Soil Water Characteristic Curve (SWCC) of the material, based on unsaturated soil mechanics principles. Such curves have been obtained for different product coal size fractions, from which the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>dewatering</b> under a range of applied pressures can be estimated.

The first {{involves}} {{an analysis of the}} groundwater character- istics of the gravels. This includes an estimation of the permeability of the gravels (using single-well dilution methods) and an analysis of the recharge mechanisms operating in them. The latter is based upon observed relationships between groundwater fluctuations and hydrometeorological factors. Secondly, the hydrological effects of gravel extraction and dewatering are analysed. By monitoring groundwater levels, {{the nature and extent of}} the zone of drav/dcvm around the gravel pits is determined. Induced recharge from rivers and recirculation of water from surface ditches into the pits, as a result <b>of</b> <b>dewatering,</b> is identified. Estimates of the proportion of induced recharge in groundwater are then made using chemical evidence. A mathematical model <b>of</b> gravel pit <b>dewatering</b> is developed. The influence of hydraulic conductivity and the initial pumping rate in determining the effects <b>of</b> <b>dewatering</b> is established by a series of sensitivity analyses using this model. As a practical example, the model is used to predict the effects <b>of</b> <b>dewatering</b> a new site near Stanton Harcourt. The extent of the drawdown around each stage in its development is determined, and this is used to evaluate the effects on private sources and agriculture in the surrounding area. Thirdly, the effects of one type of rehabilitation project (i. e. lake formation) are investigated. A method for predicting the final lake level is explained. Deviation of the observed lake levels from those predicted is explained in terms of the sealing effect of fine sediment plus chemical and biological processes. The effects of lake formation on groundwater levels and flow are described, and the changes in water quality produced by the flow of groundwater through a lake are examined. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} water in surface and {{underground}} mining activities is of great concern to Mining Engineers and Geoscientists {{to the effect that}} its accumulation in excess quantity can render mining of minerals ineffective. Surface and underground mines must therefore constantly be dewatered in order to forestall over-flooding and its attended effects on mining machinery, infrastructures industrial health, and productivity. In mine planning and design the cost <b>of</b> <b>dewatering</b> <b>of</b> mines is often captured as capital costs at the initial stage of mine development and afterwards in the cause of mining as operating costs both playing significant roles in profit or loss of Mining companies. Mines are often excavated below the water table where mine voids serve as low-pressure sinks inducing groundwater to move to the openings from the surrounding saturated rock. The result is the <b>dewatering</b> <b>of</b> nearby rock units via drainage of fractures and water-bearing strata in contact with the mine workings. There is also the potential for impacts to more remote water-bearing units and surface water bodies depending on the degree of hydrologic communication. The extent and severity of the impact on the local surface water and groundwater systems depends on the depth of the mine, the topographic and hydro-geologic setting, and the hydrologic characteristics of adjacent strata. The <b>dewatering</b> <b>of</b> mines and its cost implications starts from mineral exploration and mine development from where the rate of water flow is approximated thereby providing the initial clue to the choice <b>of</b> <b>dewatering</b> pumps and other drainage infrastructures.

40|$|This {{research}} {{assessed the}} use of gypsum (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O) as a skeleton builder for sludge dewatering since polymer conditioning of sludge affected only the rate of water release, not the extent <b>of</b> <b>dewatering.</b> The use <b>of</b> gypsum as a physical conditioner, in association with a polymer, could improve sludge filterability. More significantly, gypsum serves as a skeleton builder, forming a permeable and rigid lattice structure that can remain porous under high positive pressure during the compression step after the cake growth of the filtration, thereby maintaining {{the size of the}} micro-passages through which water is expressed. Experiments using a high pressure cell apparatus showed that a further decrease of two to seven percent of the equilibrium moisture content of the sludge cake was achieved, for sludge thicknesses for <b>dewatering</b> <b>of</b> 1 to 10 cm, by the addition of gypsum with 60 % of the original sludge solids when compared to the single polymer conditioning.
