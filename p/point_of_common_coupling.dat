5000|$|This {{method is}} an active {{islanding}} detection method {{which can be used}} by three-phase electronically coupled distributed generation (DG) units. The method is based on injecting a negative-sequence current through the voltage-sourced converter (VSC) controller and detecting and quantifying the corresponding negative-sequence voltage at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>coupling</b> (PCC) of the VSC by means of a unified three-phase signal processor (UTSP). The UTSP system is an enhanced phase-locked loop (PLL) which provides a high degree of immunity to noise, and thus enables islanding detection based on injecting a small negative-sequence current. The negative-sequence current is injected by a negative-sequence controller which is adopted as the complementary of the conventional VSC current controller. The negative-sequence current injection method detects an islanding event within 60 ms (3.5 cycles) under UL1741 test conditions, requires 2% to 3% negative-sequence current injection for islanding detection, can correctly detect an islanding event for the grid short circuit ratio of 2 or higher, and is insensitive to variations of the load parameters of UL1741 test system.|$|E

Examining low-frequency oscillatory stability is important for understanding the weakest mode that leads to oscillatory problems. The performance of three types of wind generators, the doubly fed induction generator, the squirrel cage induction generator, and the permanent magnet synchronous generator, when connected to a grid was examined. Eigenvalue analysis and time-domain analysis helped to identify oscillatory instability problems in the wind farm. Moreover, the advantages of a high voltage direct current link (HVDC) for improving instability issues was studied.

40|$|In rural {{low-voltage}} networks, distribution {{lines are}} usually highly resistive. When many distributed generators {{are connected to}} such lines, power sharing among them is difficult when using conventional droop control, as the real and reactive power have strong coupling with each other. A high droop gain can alleviate this problem but may lead the system to instability. To overcome 4 this, two droop control methods are proposed for accurate load sharing with frequency droop controller. The first method considers no communication among the distributed generators and regulates the output voltage and frequency, ensuring acceptable load sharing. The droop equations are modified with a transformation matrix based on the line R/X ration for this purpose. The second proposed method, with minimal low bandwidth communication, modifies the reference frequency of the distributed generators based on the active and reactive power flow in the lines connected to the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>coupling.</b> The performance <b>of</b> these two proposed controllers is {{compared with that of}} a controller, which includes an expensive high bandwidth communication system through time-domain simulation of a test system.

40|$|Chile is {{an energy}} {{independent}} country; goal achieved {{due to the}} diversification of the energy matrix and promoting exploitation of renewable energies. On the other side, Argentina holds permanent electricity importations from its neighboring countries, relying on these transactions to supply its demand. The Northern Interconnected System (SING) {{is one of the}} two major electrical isolated power systems in Chile with current surplus capacity and ongoing renewable energy developments. There is an existent not-operating, 345 kV transmission line between SING and the Interconnected Argentinian System (SADI), which in the past was completely dedicated to transmit power to Chile from a generation plant located in Argentina, without being fully interconnected to SADI. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in restarting the operation of the 345 kV transmission line. Therefore, this work performs a steady-state assessment based on load flow calculations with the computational tool DigSilent Power Factory, in order to evaluate the impact and capabilities of transmitting power from Chile to Argentina. This is done by simulating under-development wind projects that the German company, SoWiTec, has in Chile. The created scenarios also take into account that the exported capacity to Argentina might come from other renewables such as solar power as well as conventional technologies based on gas and coal.

40|$|High and {{increasing}} voltage Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and 5 th harmonic voltage levels have been measured {{in recent years}} on Orion NZ Ltd's rural 11 kV distribution network in Canterbury, New Zealand. On occasion, at <b>Points</b> <b>of</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Coupling</b> (PCC), the THD has exceeded the 5 % limit and the 5 th harmonic has exceeded the 4 % limit. It has been suspected that these summer season high harmonic levels are due to the large existing {{and increasing}} density of farm irrigation deep well pump loads. It is likely that adverse effects on the network and neighbouring loads would become apparent if the increasing harmonic levels are left unchecked. A practical and theoretical investigation was conducted by the Electric Power Engineering Centre (EPECentre), University of Canterbury, on behalf of Orion to determine what are the primary causes of the high harmonic levels and provide mitigation options. Several farms with installed irrigation pumps were visited and the harmonic current and voltage levels were measured when the pumps were operating. Substation measurements were also simultaneously taken. A computer harmonic model of the local 11 kV network and loads was created that provided an accurate description of actual network conditions. An examination of Orion's system from the view of harmonic management was performed. The investigation revealed that the most significant cause of high harmonics levels is the comparatively large harmonic current injections by local irrigation pumps using Variable Speed Drives. A secondary cause is resonances in the network, often dynamically created by Power Factor (PF) capacitors switching online at various farms. To keep the rural network infrastructure in an effective and sustainable operating condition, mitigation measures are needed. Options researched included simulations of harmonic filters placed at various network points, {{and the use of}} alternate vector group transformers. Suggestions are made regarding objectives for harmonic limits at different network voltage levels, so as to determine harmonic limits for load installations...|$|R

To limit the total harmonic distortion in the line voltage and currents at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>common</b> <b>coupling</b> (PCC), active power filters are commonly employed. This paper investigates {{the use of the}} multilevel modular converter (MMC) for harmonics mitigation due to its high bandwidth compared with conventional converters.

For this reason an MMC-based double-star STATCOM is developed and tested for two representative case studies, i. e., for grid currents and PCC voltage harmonics. The results verify the capability of the MMC to mitigate harmonics up to the thirteenth order, while maintaining a low effective switching frequency and thus, low switching losses. </p...|$|R
