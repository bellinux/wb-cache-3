Instructor, Department of Epidemiology and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences Abstract Background: Wart is {{a common}} and {{contagious}} viral disease of the skin caused by papilloma viruses which leads to aesthetic and psychological problems, and if occurred in touching and pressured {{parts of the body}} causes pain and inflammation. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of Clove bud, Nigella, Salix alba and Olive oil which have wound disinfectant, anesthetic, analgesic and wound healing properties on wart treatment in comparison with the conventional treatment. Materials and methods: This randomized double blind controlled clinical trial was conducted on 291 female students selected form guidance and high schools in Khorramabad, Lorestan, Iran, during the year 2007. The diagnosis of wart was confirmed by a dermatologist according to the diagnosis criteria. The cases fulfilling the inclusion criteria were assigned in 3 study groups randomly. The first group was treated with the conventional treatment (Salicylic acid 16. 7 %, lactic acid 16. 7 % in Collodione body), the second group with herbal medicine without acid in olive oil, and the third group with herbal medicine alongside salicylic acid 1 % and lactic acid 1 % in olive oil. Each group was administered the drugs for 6 weeks. The effects of drugs on lesions were assessed after 4 and 6 weeks and compared among 3 groups using repeated measures test. Results: Out of 291 cases, a total of 177 cases used the drug on a regular basis. Improvement of lesion, after 4 weeks, was 62. 6 % for conventional therapy, 42. 9 % far herbal therapy with acid, and 55. 1 % for herbal therapy without acid. After 6 weeks, this improvement was 89. 9 % for conventional therapy, 61. 3 % for herbal therapy with acid, and 87. 8 % for herbal therapy without acid. Routine treatment was more efficient than herbal therapy with acid (P< 0. 000). The efficacy of routine therapy was not significantly different from that of herbal therapy without acid (P= 1. 000) and herbal therapy with acid was less efficient than herbal therapy without acid (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Using herbal therapy, with or without acid is significantly efficient in lesion regression. Also, a prolonged duration of therapy leads to a better resolution of lesions in all three types of therapy. The above-mentioned plants may be used as complementary or alternative therapies in the treatment of common wart...|$|R
