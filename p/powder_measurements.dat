40|$|Neutron diffraction, i. e. {{coherent}} elastic neutron scattering, is a {{well established}} technique for structural studies of geomaterials. In contrast to this, other neutron scattering techniques have only rarely been applied to study properties of minerals, although undoubtedly such studies would provide insight not attainable otherwise. These other neutron scattering techniques, such as inelastic coherent scattering, inelastic incoherent scattering, inelastic magnetic scattering, are all well established in the solid state physics community. Hence, the expertise available there can readily be transferred and this will open up new research opportunities and provide new understanding in the Earth Sciences. Inelastic coherent scattering on single crystals is a unique way to study the lattice dynamics, as this techniques allows to determine the phonon dispersion.

30|$|The 100 -μ m mass {{absorption}} coefficient derived from our olivine-plate measurements shows the largest decrease at 10 K compared with 300 K of all data in Table 1. This decrease is connected with an extreme steepening of the spectrum in the wavelength range 50 – 100 μ m (see Fig. 1). Chihara et al. (2001) have noted such a steepening also in their <b>powder</b> <b>measurements</b> of forsterite. At liquid helium temperature, they derive a power-law exponent of about β = 5.0 for the spectral dependence. In our data, the slope is even steeper in this wavelength range. This {{could be related to}} the long-wavelength wings of the lattice-vibration bands at shorter wavelengths (especially at 33 μ m and 50 μ m) and should probably not be taken as a continuum slope. The mentioned bands sharpen at lower temperatures and shift to shorter wavelengths, which will likely result in a steepening of the spectrum in the range of their long-wavelength wings. The slope in this wavelength range may therefore strongly depend on the orientation of the crystal. Unfortunately, we cannot check this effect for olivine by simulations because low-temperature optical constants are not available. When using the optical constants of forsterite at 50 K by Suto et al. (2006), we do not observe this effect (see Fig. 1). However, forsterite bands are located at shorter wavelengths and are somewhat sharper, so that their long-wavelength wings may be of less influence. We are unable to clarify this issue at the present time.|$|E

Dry powders were made of water-soluble excipients (e. g., lactose, albumin) combined with water-insoluble material (e. g., lung surfactant), using a standard single-step spray-drying process. Aerosolization properties were assessed with a Spinbaler(TM) device in vitro in both an Andersen cascade impactor and an Aerosizer(TM). Results. By properly choosing excipient concentration and varying the spray drying parameters, a high degree of control was achieved over the physical properties of the dry powders. Mean geometric diameters ranged between 3 and 15 mu m, and tap densities between 0. 04 and 0. 6 g/cm(3). Theoretical estimates of mass mean aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) were rationalized and calculated in terms of geometric particle diameters and bulk tap densities. Experimental values of MMAD obtained from the Aerosizer(TM) most closely approximated the theoretical estimates, as compared to those obtained from the Andersen cascade impactor.

40|$|<b>Powder</b> Kurtz-Perry <b>measurements</b> were {{performed}} {{for the title}} crystals. The efficiencies of second harmonic generation were determined (0. 34, 0. 84, 0. 80, 0. 97 and 1. 01) relative to potassium hydrogen phosphate. The L-lysine moiety was characterized by wavenumbers and relative intensities of the infrared and Raman bands originating from internal vibrations. The presence of hydrogen bonds in the studied crystals is noted and the potential role {{of this type of}} intermolecular interaction in the second harmonic generation phenomena is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{structures}} in an antiperovskite system, Mn 3 Cu 1 −xGexN, {{with a large}} magnetovolume effect above x= 0. 15 have been studied by neutron <b>powder</b> diffraction <b>measurement.</b> The present neutron study revealed that not only a cubic crystal structure but also a Gamma 5 g antiferromagnetic spin structure are key ingredients of the large magnetovolume effect in this itinerant electron system. The large magnetovolume effect is possibly ascribed to the geometrical frustration originating from the corner-shared octahedra of the antiperovskite structure...|$|R
