5000|$|Xcelerator's {{powerful}} hydraulic catapult motor accelerates {{the train}} to 82 mi/h km/h in 2.3 seconds (about 1.62 g). It only uses 157 ft of track to launch the train. The twin hydraulic catapult motor achieves a maximum of [...] each while accelerating the train. Xcelerator's hydraulic motor system has the mechanical capability of accelerating vehicles to a speed of 117 mi/h km/h or more, though it only needs to hit 82. In order for a train to launch, it must [...] "drift" [...] back to [...] "hook" [...] into the catch car. Twenty-four volts are used to demagnetize a pin underneath the third car, causing it to drop. At the same time, two bellows actuators fill up with air, causing the two drive tires holding the train in place, at the train's rear, to retract. The brakes will lower while the train rolls back to hook, and the pin will then hook into the catch car—which is over 7 ft long. Once connected, the motor will pull the catch car over nylon runners and launch the train. In order to stop the catch car, it passes over {{its own set of}} magnetic brakes. If the train is lightly loaded, the motor has to work harder to attain launch speed. Often the catch car may overshoot its ending position and down itself if it cannot attain the speed within parameters. The train must also clear the launch track within three seconds, or the ride will down itself and produce a shortshot. From the time the launch begins, the train has 8.25 seconds to pass over a <b>proximity</b> <b>switch</b> (Hall effect sensor) {{near the bottom of the}} first valley, thus clearing the starting block. If the train does not pass over the switch within the given time frame, the ride will down itself.|$|E

It has been ascertained that work-holding of different workpiece materials and shapes during machining operation {{is one of the}} problems encountered during CNC milling machining operations.

40|$|The {{principle}} of the Hall effect and its application to the characterization of semiconductors are described. The physical origin of the Hall effect, discovered by Edwin H. Hall in 1879, is the Lorentz force acting on the charge carriers in a solid. The Hall voltage, which is generated perpendicular to the current flow in the sample, {{is proportional to the}} carrier mobility in the sample. Its sign depends on the type of the majority charge carrier electrons or holes and can be used to determine if a semiconductor is n or p type. From the measured Hall voltage, the carrier concentration n of the Hall sample can be determined. In combination with a conductivity amp; 963; measurement, the Hall mobility amp; 956;H of the sample can be calculated according to amp; 956; amp; 8201; amp; 8201; amp; 963; qn. Though in principle simple, the preparation of the Hall measurement samples and the interpretation of the measurements needs some care and the appropriate theory for the charge carrier transport in semiconductors. The normal Hall effect can be explained by a semiclassical theory, while the quantum Hall effect, discovered by von Klitzing in 1980, is a true quantum effect, which occurs only at very high fields at low temperatures in two dimensional electron gases.
