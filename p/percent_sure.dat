25|$|In 2002, {{paleoanthropologist}} Francesco Mallegni conducted DNA {{testing on}} the recently excavated bodies of Ugolino and his children. His analysis {{agrees with the}} remains being a father, his sons and his grandsons. Additional comparison to DNA from modern day members of the Gherardesca family leave Mallegni about 98 <b>percent</b> <b>sure</b> that he has identified the remains correctly. However, the forensic analysis discredits the allegation of cannibalism. Analysis of the rib bones of the Ugolino skeleton reveals traces of magnesium, but no zinc, implying he had consumed no meat {{in the months before}} his death. Ugolino also had few remaining teeth and {{is believed to have been}} in his 70s when he was imprisoned, making it further unlikely that he could have outlived and eaten his descendants in captivity. Additionally, Mallegni notes that the putative Ugolino skull was damaged; perhaps he did not ultimately die of starvation, although malnourishment is evident.|$|E

40|$|C 1 - Journal Articles RefereedBACKGROUND: Although {{industry}} sponsors provide approximately 70 {{percent of}} the funding for clinical drug trials in the United States, {{little is known about}} the legal agreements that exist between industry sponsors and academic investigators. We studied institutional standards regarding contractual provisions that restrict investigators' control over trials. METHODS: We used a structured, cross-sectional mail survey of medical-school research administrators responsible for negotiating clinical-trial agreements with industry sponsors. RESULTS: Of 122 institutions approached, 107 participated. There was a high degree of consensus among administrators about the acceptability of several contractual provisions relating to publications. For example, more than 85 percent reported that their office would not approve provisions giving industry sponsors the authority to revise manuscripts or decide whether results should be published. There was considerable disagreement about the acceptability of provisions allowing the sponsor to insert its own statistical analyses in manuscripts (24 percent allowed them, 47 percent disallowed them, and 29 <b>percent</b> were not <b>sure</b> whether they should allow them), draft the manuscript (50 percent allowed it, 40 percent disallowed it, and 11 <b>percent</b> were not <b>sure</b> whether they should allow it), and prohibit investigators from sharing data with third parties after the trial is over (41 percent allowed it, 34 percent disallowed it, and 24 <b>percent</b> were not <b>sure</b> whether they should allow it). Disputes were common after the agreements had been signed and most frequently centered on payment (75 percent of administrators reported at least one such dispute in the previous year), intellectual property (30 percent), and control of or access to data (17 percent). CONCLUSIONS: Standards for certain restrictive provisions in clinical-trial agreements with industry sponsors vary considerably among academic medical centers. Greater sharing of information about legal relationships with industry sponsors is desirable in order to build consensus about appropriate standards. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

40|$|Using {{a simple}} {{arbitrage}} argument, positivists {{claim that the}} interest rate provides the right basis to fix the discount rate to evaluate green investment projects.

On the other band, ethicists estimate the discount rate using the marginal rate of substitution between current and future consumption. From classical estimations of intertemporal inequality aversion and prudence, assuming a 2 percent growth rate of consumption, they recommend a discount rate of around 3. 5 percent. Ethicists are therefore less prone to investing for the future than positivists. I provide two roads to reconcile the two approaches. First, I claim that the positivist approach is correct f green investment projects are financed by a reallocation of resources from productive capital in the economy, whereas ethicists are correct if the projects are financed by a reduction in current consumption. Second, I claim that ethicists should use a rate between 1 percent and 2 <b>percent</b> to discount <b>sure</b> benefits that occur in the distant future to take the uncertainty surrounding the future prosperity of the economy into account. Finally, a risk premium should be added to the discount rate that is proportional to the socioeconomic beta of the investment project...|$|R

This study investigates factors affecting international students?????? preferences regarding where to start their careers.

Information was collected from international graduate students at Texas A&M University, using a computer-assisted survey. Multinomial probit and logit models were {{used to analyze the}} data. Unique to this study is that students could indicate they are not sure where they prefer to start their careers. An inference from the statistical test based on the inverse Mills ratio is that there are no significant differences between two groups, those who are not sure and those with defined preferences. Fifty-one percent of the students surveyed indicated they preferred to begin their careers in the U. S., 22 percent preferred their home countries, and 27 <b>percent</b> were not <b>sure.</b> Of the students who preferred their home country over the U. S., significant influencers are political and career indices, number of years lived in the U. S., enrollment in Engineering and Business, and gender. A change in either the political or career indices to favor the U. S. systems and more years lived in the U. S. both increased the likelihood of students?????? preferring to start their careers in the U. S. Both female students and students enrolled in Engineering and Business were more likely to prefer the U. S. For students unsure of their preferences, significant variables are career and civil indices, number of years lived in the U. S., degree level, source of funding, and marital status. Results are consistent with previous studies, but with notable differences. For students who are unsure of their preferences, salary differences between the U. S. and their home countries are not statistically significant. Contrary to earlier literature, regional differences do not have a statistically significant effect on students?????? preferences. Consistency between this study of preferences and previous studies on actual decisions indicates students act on their preferences when starting their careers.

40|$|Nebraskans have {{a history}} of being charitable. This is {{important}} for the future of rural communities since many of them rely on local donations for their civic improvement projects and expansion of capital for new business development. Given that, do rural Nebraskans contribute annually to charitable causes? How much of their contributions go to their local community? This report details 3, 199 responses to the 2001 Nebraska Rural Poll, the sixth annual effort to understand rural Nebraskans’ perceptions. Respondents were asked a series of questions regarding their charitable giving. For all questions, comparisons are made among different respondent subgroups, e. g., comparisons by age, occupation, region, etc. Based on these analyses, some key findings emerged: •	Most rural Nebraskans (80 %) contribute money annually to charitable causes. Persons most likely to contribute annually to charitable causes include: persons living in the Southeast region of the state, individuals with the highest household incomes, persons age 65 and older, males, married and widowed respondents, persons with the highest educational levels, and individuals with professional occupations. •	One-half of the persons who contribute annually to charitable causes give at least $ 500. Thirteen percent contribute $ 2, 500 or more. Groups that tend to contribute more money to charitable causes include: persons with higher household incomes, individuals between the ages of 50 and 64, males, married respondents, persons with higher educational levels, and individuals with professional occupations. •	The majority of rural Nebraskans who have experienced many economic hardships during the past year continue to contribute annually to charitable causes. The persons experiencing the most economic hardships are less likely than the persons experiencing fewer hardships to contribute to charitable causes; however, two-thirds of the persons experiencing six or more hardships contribute to charitable causes. •	Over 60 percent of the persons who contribute annually to charitable causes say that at least 50 % of their total giving goes to support organizations, causes or charity in their local community. Twenty-two percent state that 50 % - 75 % of their giving goes to their local community, and 40 percent say that more than 75 % of their gifts goes to their community. •	Certain groups are more likely than others to state that the majority of their giving goes to their local community. Persons with higher household incomes, younger respondents, married persons, and individuals with higher educational levels are the groups most likely to say that more than 75 % of their giving goes to their local community. •	When asked which local organizations, causes or charity they have donated money to in the last three years, more than one-half of the contributors have donated money to a local church or religious group (89 %), a local youth group (64 %), and a local food bank (51 %). Other groups people have donated money to include: local schools (K- 12) (50 %), local community/civic improvement organization or project (49 %), local veterans group (30 %), local health care institution (28 %), and a local service or fraternal organization (23 %). •	Forty-one percent of rural Nebraskans believe their community would benefit from a perpetual community endowment fund. Forty-one <b>percent</b> are not <b>sure</b> their community would benefit, 10 percent think their community would not benefit from a perpetual endowment fund, and 8 percent say their community already has one. •	Groups most likely to believe their community would benefit from a perpetual community endowment fund include: persons with higher household incomes, individuals under the age of 50, males, the divorced or separated respondents, persons with higher educational levels, and individuals with professional occupations. •	The most common reason given for not contributing to charitable causes is “I don’t have the money. ” Eighty-one percent of the persons who do not contribute annually to charitable causes say this is a reason why they do not. Other reasons include: I would rather donate my time than my money (15 %), there have not been causes that deserve my support (8 %), no one has asked me to donate (4 %), and I don’t really know how to go about it (2 %). •	Some of the reasons for not contributing annually to charitable causes differ by income, age, and gender. Respondents with higher household incomes are more likely than the persons with lower incomes to say there have not been causes that deserve their support and they would rather donate their time than their money. The persons with lower incomes are more likely than the persons with higher incomes to say they don’t have the money to contribute. Younger respondents are more likely than older respondents to say they don’t really know how to go about contributing. Males are more likely than females to say there have not been causes that deserve their support...|$|R

40|$|Nebraska’s economy {{growth has}} slowed this past year, and recent reports show {{that some of}} Nebraska’s {{counties}} are the poorest in the nation. How have these changes affected rural Nebraskans? How do rural Nebraskans perceive their quality of life? Do their perceptions differ by community size, the region in which they live, or their occupation? How have they responded to the higher cost of living? Are they able to meet their financial goals? This report details 3, 199 responses to the 2001 Nebraska Rural Poll, the sixth annual effort to understand rural Nebraskans’ perceptions. Respondents were asked {{a series of questions}} regarding their general well-being, their satisfaction with specific aspects of well-being, and how they are responding to the higher cost of living. Trends for the well-being questions are examined by comparing data from the five previous polls to this year’s results. For all questions, comparisons are made among different respondent subgroups, i. e., comparisons by age, occupation, region, etc. Based on these analyses, some key findings emerged: •	 Rural Nebraskans are more negative about their current situation than they were last year. This year, 32 percent state they are better off than they were five years ago; however, this compares to 40 percent in 2000. This is the lowest percentage reported during a six-year period. Nineteen percent of the respondents say they are worse off than five years ago, while 16 percent felt this way last year. The percent responding that their situation remained about the same increased from 44 percent last year to 49 percent in 2001. •	 When asked about the future, fewer respondents assert they will be better off ten years from now, as compared to last year’s results. This year, 34 percent state they will be better off ten years from now, compared to 38 percent last year. The proportion responding they will be worse off increased from 18 percent to 21 percent. The proportion saying they will be about the same in ten years remained steady at 45 percent. •	 Farmers and ranchers are less optimistic than persons with other occupations about their current situation. Only 24 percent of the farmers and ranchers state they are better off compared to five years ago. In comparison, 50 percent of those with professional occupations say they are better off. •	 Manual laborers are more likely to believe that people are powerless to control their own lives. Just over one-half (51 %) of the manual laborers either strongly agree or agree with the statement that “ [...] . people are powerless to control their own lives. ” In contrast, only 21 percent of persons with professional occupations agree with the statement. •	 Respondents report being most satisfied with their family, their marriage, and their religion/spirituality. The items receiving the highest proportion of “very dissatisfied” responses include financial security during retirement, current income level and job opportunities. •	 Manual laborers are more likely than those with other occupations to express dissatisfaction with their job opportunities. Sixty percent of the manual laborers are dissatisfied with their job opportunities, compared to only 32 percent of the farmers and ranchers. •	 At least one-third of rural Nebraskans have experienced the following economic hardships during the past year: using savings to meet household expenses, delaying a family vacation {{because of a lack of}} money, and being unable to contribute any money toward retirement because the money was needed for everyday household expenses. Twenty percent of rural Nebraskans have taken another job to help meet household expenses during the past year.

40|$|Many rural {{communities}} have experienced population and economic declines {{during the past}} decade. In addition, many have an aging population that leaves them struggling to remain viable. However, new technological improvements offer the potential for business growth in these areas. Given these changes, how do rural Nebraskans feel about their community? Are they planning to move from their community in the next year? Are they investing their time and money in their community? This report details 2, 841 responses to the 2002 Nebraska Rural Poll, the seventh annual effort to understand rural Nebraskans’ perceptions.
