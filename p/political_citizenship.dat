Cultural citizenship consists of implications in language, literature, education, art, religion, and additional facets of culture. Cultural citizenship does not replace legal or <b>political</b> concepts of <b>citizenship.</b> Instead, cultural citizenship works in tandem with legal and <b>political</b> notions of <b>citizenship</b> to create a comprehensive understanding of how individuals identify themselves and their own belonging {{within a community}} or nation state.

50|$|In fact, a {{somewhat}} republican but primarily militant mood {{prevailed in the}} spring of 1848 in the citizenry of Konstanz. Since March 5, 1848, there had been a permanent Citizens' Committee, convened at a public meeting, which was to represent the <b>political</b> <b>citizenship</b> at the pre-parliamentary assemblies in Offenburg. The situation in the city was tense. On the - as it turned out false - rumor that tens of thousands of armed and unarmed Frenchmen near Offenburg crossed the border to ravage the country, on March 26 a general arming of the citizenry took place. Franz Sigel, a former officer who was in the quasi-militarized city, organized a militia of 400 men on behalf of the mayor, Mayor Charles Hüetlin. The hopes of Hecker and Struve were based on the militia.|$|E

50|$|Citizenship and {{associated}} claims have split on two dimensions: formal legal citizenship, and full social and <b>political</b> <b>citizenship.</b> While claims of African ancestry may have created social scandal (and that varied {{in time and}} place), even in Thomas Jefferson's time, a person of less than one-quarter African ancestry could be considered legally white. Later this was changed so that a person had {{to have at least}} seven-eighths European ancestry to be legally white. Jefferson's mixed-race children from his relationship with Sally Hemings, were seven-eighths white. There is ample evidence in historical records that people of mixed race were accepted as white and full citizens in communities, as they were documented as exercising the rights of citizens to bear arms and vote. Social acceptance by the majority-white community was often the key as to whether a person was considered white, more than details about ancestry, especially in early periods on the frontier when few records were kept and people often did not know much about their origins.|$|E
50|$|Scholars {{suggest that}} the concept of {{citizenship}} contains many unresolved issues, sometimes called tensions, existing within the relation, that continue to reflect uncertainty about what citizenship is supposed to mean. Some unresolved issues regarding citizenship include questions about what is the proper balance between duties and rights. Another is a question about what is the proper balance between <b>political</b> <b>citizenship</b> versus social citizenship. Some thinkers see benefits with people being absent from public affairs, since too much participation such as revolution can be destructive, yet too little participation such as total apathy can be problematic as well. Citizenship {{can be seen as a}} special elite status, and it can also be seen as a democratizing force and something that everybody has; the concept can include both senses. According to sociologist Arthur Stinchcombe, citizenship is based on the extent that a person can control one's own destiny within the group in the sense of being able to influence the government of the group. One last distinction within citizenship is the so-called consent descent distinction, and this issue addresses whether citizenship is a fundamental matter determined by a person choosing to belong to a particular nation--by his or her consent--or is citizenship a matter of where a person was born--that is, by his or her descent.|$|E
5000|$|John Stuart Mill in {{his work}} On Liberty (1859) {{believed}} {{that there should be}} no distinctions between men and women, and that both were capable of citizenship. British sociologist Thomas Humphrey Marshall suggested that the changing patterns of citizenship were as follows: first, a civil relation in the sense of having equality before the law, followed by <b>political</b> <b>citizenship</b> in the sense of having the power to vote, and later a social citizenship in the sense of having the state support individual persons along the lines of a welfare state. Marshall argued in the middle of the 20th century that modern citizenship encompassed all three dimensions: civil, political, and social. He wrote that citizenship required a vital sense of community in the sense of a feeling of loyalty to a common civilization. Thinkers such as Marc Steinberg saw citizenship emerge from a class struggle interrelated with the principle of nationalism. People who were native-born or naturalised members of the state won a greater share of the rights out of [...] "a continuing series of transactions between persons and agents of a given state in which each has enforceable rights and obligations", according to Steinberg. This give-and-take to a common acceptance of the powers of both the citizen and the state. He argued that: ...|$|E

5000|$|The Gay Rights Movement started {{because the}} Stonewall Riots of 1969 {{crystallized}} a broad grass-roots mobilization of the homosexual movement. New gay liberationist gave political meaning to “coming out” by extending the psychological-personal process into public life. During the 1950s {{the most feared}} thing of the homosexual culture was “coming out”, the homosexual culture of the 1950s did {{everything they could to}} help keep their sexuality a secret from the public and everyone else in their lives, but Alfred Kinsey's research on homosexuality proved that 39% of the unmarried male population had at least one homosexual experience to orgasm between adolescence and old age. By the gay liberationist making “coming out” public they helped mobilize people to live full-time as a homosexual, they no longer had to live in secret. Homosexuals could now enjoy sexual relationships and encounters much more often than ever before. They no longer had to sneak around and occasionally receive the sexual attention that they desire or force themselves into a heterosexual relationship in which they had no interest, and was full of lies. The 1970 gay novelist, Brad Gooch, wrote the “Golden Age of Promiscuity” meaning that the gay male community finally had reached a rich culture of “easy sex”, “sex without” commitment, obligation or long-term relationships. [...] The gay rights movement was reclamation of cultural, social, and <b>political</b> <b>citizenship</b> through sex and decriminalized gay sex, by removing gay sex as a psychological sickness.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the more}} recent {{publications}} of Maria Cotera is Native Speakers. In {{the first part of}} this text Maria Cotera discusses the implications of the works created by Ella Deloria, Zora Neale Hurston, and Jovita González. During the 1920s and 1930s these women became well known in the fields of ethnolinguistics, folklore studies, and anthropology. Each collaborated with leading intellectual men in their respective disciplines in order to produce accounts and writings about their respective communities. The resiliency that these women displayed is evident in the fact that they were active in their communities assisting in both political and cultural movements. Ella Deloria attempted to alter both public opinion and policy with respect to Indian and Dakota people; Ella worked with and supported Indian youth for over fifty years. Zora Neale Hurston always believed that [...] "Black people needn't look to Anglo American culture for models of beauty, <b>political</b> <b>citizenship,</b> or identity, a sentiment vividly expressed in her works of folklore, drama,and creative fiction." [...] Jovita González attempted to revive the past of the culture of Mexicano ranching. Jovita was both a political and educational activist who was involved in fighting against segregational policies in South Texas that hindered her people from having success in the regional economic uprise in South Texas. The struggles that each of these three women endured during their careers is very real and historically, is fairly similar to many other women writers during this time period.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{quite similar}} to salsa {{on the surface of}} things due to origins from son heritage, timba has certain qualities of its own which {{distinguish}} it from salsa, similar to the way American R&B is distinguished from soul. In general, timba {{is considered to be a}} highly aggressive type of music, with rhythm and [...] "swing" [...] taking precedence over melody and lyricism. Associated with timba is a radically sexual and provocative dance style known as despelote (literally meaning chaos or frenzy) that consists of rapid gyrations of the body and pelvis, thrusting and trembling motions, bending over and generating harmonic oscillations of the gluteous maximus. Those involved in the performance and popularization of timba crafted a culture of black, strong, masculine pride, and a narrative of male hypersexulaity to go with timba's so-called [...] "masculine" [...] sound. [...] In a socialist society where value and identity center on labor and <b>political</b> <b>citizenship,</b> black males were representing themselves not as forces of production but of pleasure. Timba is musically complex, highly danceable, and reflects the problems and contradictions of contemporary Cuban society because it expresses a repetitive beat that relates to the repetitive day-to-day life the Cubans endured during the early 1990s. [...] It is a dynamic evolution of salsa, full of improvisation and Afro Cuban heritage, based on son, Rumba and mambo, taking inspiration from Latin jazz, and is highly percussive with complex sections. Very little [...] "traditional" [...] salsa existed (or exists) in Cuba, the most influential foreign 'salsero' being Venezuelan Oscar D'León, who is one of the few salsa artists to have performed in Cuba. Timba musicians thus rightly claim a different musical heritage from salsa musicians.|$|E

40|$|Cities {{and urban}} spaces {{around the world}} are {{changing}} rapidly from their origins in the industrialising world to a post-industrial, hard wired landscape. A further embellishment is the advent of mobile media technologies supported by both existing and new communications and computing technology which claim to put the urban dweller {{at the heart of a}} new, informed and ‘liberated’ seat of participatory urban governance. This networked, sensor enabled society permits flows of information in a multitude of directions ostensibly empowering the citizenry through ‘smart’ installations such as ‘talking bus stops’ detailing services, delays, transport interconnections and even weather conditions along desired routes. However, while there is considerable potential for creative and transformative kinds of citizen participation, there is also the momentum for ‘function-creep’, whereby vast amounts of data are garnered in a broad application of urban surveillance. This kind of monitoring and capacity for surveillance connects with attempts by civic authorities to regulate, restrict, rebrand and reframe urban public spaces into governable and predictable arenas of consumption. This article considers questions around the possibilities for retaining and revitalising forms of urban citizenship, set in the context of Marshall’s original premise of civil, social and <b>political</b> <b>citizenship(s)</b> in the middle of the last century, following World War Two and the coming of the modern welfare state...|$|R

Through a conceptual review the work of scholars who have written extensively about the dangers of apolitical citizenship education and/or the need for <b>political</b> <b>citizenship</b> education are examined. In particular, it analyzed notions of politics and citizenship and conceptions of depoliticized and <b>political</b> <b>citizenship</b> education from which key characteristics of <b>political</b> <b>citizenship</b> education are derived.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the Finnish {{political}} field {{has been in a}} state of flux. This research is interested in examining how these changes impact the formation of <b>political</b> <b>citizenship.</b> <b>Political</b> <b>citizenship</b> is understood as an intersectionally constructed identity and studied in the context of election advertising. According to intersectionality theory, identity is constructed situationally in the intersection of different cultural, discursive categories. The general purpose of the study is {{to take part in the}} discussion concerning the discursive conditions of possibility with which <b>political</b> <b>citizenship</b> is defined. Thus it is possible to picture the boundaries that shape the negotiation on what kind of values and attitudes our society is based, or on which we would like it to be based. This research belongs to the field of media and cultural studies and takes part in the discussion on <b>political</b> <b>citizenship.</b> The empirical materials show how the public and private are mixed, and how they jointly determine the norms of a proper citizen. The research question is: Through what kind of categorizations of gender, family status, ethnic group, and age is <b>political</b> <b>citizenship</b> defined? <b>Political</b> <b>citizenship</b> is also approached from the view of gender research. The empirical materials consist of election advertising brochures from two elections: the European parliamentary elections in 2009 and the Finnish national parliamentary elections in 2011. The materials are organized and interpreted by using member categorization analysis and qualitative matrices. The research contributes theoretically and methodologically to the discussion of the need to redefine <b>political</b> <b>citizenship</b> by showing how the changing and multifaceted concept of <b>political</b> <b>citizenship</b> can be better understood by intersectional analysis in the context of election advertising. At the same time, the research presents solutions to some analytical problems in intersectionality research. On the societal level, this work contributes to discussion on gendered politics and the state of the gender contract in society: how the possibilities to access public spaces are still different for women and men, and what kind of potential there is to expand these spaces. This study shows that the themes that emerge in societal debates are linked to the formation of citizens' identities through membership in different cultural categories. The themes that arise from the private field, such as family status or ethnic group, justify the distinctions that are used to determine categories that define citizenship. Thus, belonging to or not conforming to particular categories determines which kinds of identities are possible. Furthermore, as new identities are sought, they are constrained by boundaries of the gender contract and acceptable forms of portraying national identit...|$|E
