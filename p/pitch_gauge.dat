50|$|A thread gauge, {{also known}} as a screw <b>pitch</b> <b>gauge</b> or <b>pitch</b> <b>gauge,</b> is used to measure the pitch or lead of a screw thread. The {{uppermost}} gauge in the image is an ISO metric <b>pitch</b> <b>gauge,</b> the larger gauge in the center is for measuring the Acme thread form, and the lower gauge is for Whitworth screws.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pitch</b> <b>Gauge</b> (noun: pich-geyj) is a freemium-based mobile {{application}} created by Prolific Methods, Inc. {{that can be}} used on smartphones and tablet computers. It was first released for Apple’s iOS in September, 2010 and was subsequently released to Android, Windows, and BlackBerry. Since release, the app has become popular among roofers, contractors, and property claims adjusters and has seen hundreds of thousands of downloads across the industry worldwide. <b>Pitch</b> <b>Gauge</b> has been praised for being a very straightforward and simple app.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pitch</b> <b>Gauge</b> {{is used to}} {{determine}} the slope or pitch of roofs, and can also provide an estimate of the square footage when given the length, width, pitch, and cut level (complexity).|$|E
50|$|Thread <b>pitch</b> <b>gauges</b> {{are used}} as a {{reference}} tool in determining the pitch of a thread that is on a screw or in a tapped hole. This tool is not used as a precision measuring instrument. This device allows the user to determine {{the profile of the}} given thread and quickly categorize the thread by shape and pitch. This device also saves time, in that it removes the need for the user to measure and calculate the thread pitch of the threaded item.|$|R
50|$|A {{therapist}} will {{be aware}} of a child's response to the smell of substances, and may experiment with putting different fragrances in play dough or rice. If a child actively likes strong odors, specific toys with this feature {{can be used in}} therapy. Sound can be focused on by experimenting with talking toys, games on computers, musical instruments, squeaky toys and all sorts of music. Clapping together, rhymes, repeating phrases and tongue twisters are useful activities. Some children on the autism spectrum respond to music but not voices, in which case a melodic or “sing-song” voice may be preferred. The therapist may try different tones of voice, <b>pitches,</b> and <b>gauge</b> a child's reaction.|$|R
40|$|Although averageness is {{preferred}} in auditory stimuli (eg music) and non-face objects (eg wristwatches), exaggerated feminine characteristics are preferred to averageness in female faces. To establish {{whether or not}} men prefer femininity in female voices to average characteristics, we conducted a correlational study (study 1) to assess the relationship between voice pitch and attractiveness ratings. We found a positive linear relationship between voice pitch and attractiveness ratings. In study 2 we manipulated pitch in women's voices with low (lower than average), average, and high (higher than average) starting <b>pitches</b> and <b>gauged</b> men's preferences. Men preferred women's voices with raised pitch for all levels of starting pitch. These findings suggest that men prefer high voice pitch to average voice pitch in women's voices...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental, numerical, and reliability {{study on the}} fracture behaviour of bolted steel tensile connections with various bolt arrangements. A total of 36 full-scale specimens were tested under tension until fracture. The main test parameters included the geometric pattern of the connections and the connection details such as <b>pitch,</b> <b>gauge,</b> edge distance and material. The test {{results show that the}} predictions of the ultimate capacity based on the s 2 / 4 g rule can be conservative, which may be mainly due to the ‘reinforcement’ effect of the biaxial stress state that exists between the bolt holes. However, for the specimens fabricated using higher strength steel with lower ductility, the conservatism is reduced substantially. Moreover, the test efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of the test ultimate capacity over the theoretical capacity of the gross section, was also examined. A higher test efficiency can be found when the hole spacing/edge distance is decreased/increased, although substantial increase in the edge distance can be ineffective. In addition, less ductile steel can lead to lower test efficiency. Furthermore, a numerical study was undertaken, where good agreements were observed between the numerical and the test results. With available test data, reliability analysis was finally performed to re-examine the rationale behind the resistance factors used in the current design codes.

50|$|Although the Mexican vihuela has {{the same}} name as the {{historic}} Spanish plucked string instrument, the two are distinct. The Mexican vihuela has {{more in common with}} the Timple Canario (see: timple) due to both having five strings and both having vaulted (convex) backs. The Mexican vihuela is tuned similarly to the guitar. The difference is that the open G, the D and the A strings are tuned an octave higher than a guitar thus giving it a tenor sound or a higher <b>pitch.</b> The <b>gauge</b> of the strings and the order in which they are applied is important in producing a soft sound or a punchy bold sound when the instrument is strummed (the strum is called a mánico, and also references rhythmic patterns). The implementation of the Vihuela to a Mariachi is to give a duet of sorts with the Spanish guitar, one having a low tuning while the vihuela having the higher tuining to complement eachother. The optimal spot to strum this instrument is between the sound hole and the point where the fret board or neck meets the body of the instrument. This area is where a pick guard can be installed (the same linear area between the upper and lower bouts closest to the fingerboard.) The Mexican vihuela is a small, deep-bodied rhythm guitar built along the same lines as the guitarrón. The Mexican Vihuela is are used by Mariachi groups. This instrument is strummed with all of the fingernail tips to produce a rich, full and clear sound of the chords being played. A finger pick (la púa) on the pointer finger (1st finger - dedo índice) gives it a brighter and clearer sound when strummed. Many vihuela players have longer than normal fingernails on their strumming hand to facilitate their playing technique and to also get a clear crystal sound.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} observe {{the state of the}} contact and the release between ball and {{fingertips}} during baseball <b>pitching,</b> four strain <b>gauges</b> were affixed crosswise to the surface of each nail of participant's 2 nd and 3 rd fingers. Simultaneously, the angular velocities of the upper limb, trunk and lower limb were also measured with accelerometers and gyroscope sensors {{to observe the}} joint motion during pitching. Participants of this study pitched fastball and some breaking balls more than ten times toward the net located in 5 m forward. The similarity, difference and time lag of motions among fastball, slider and screwball pitches were clarified through analysis of angular velocities. The timings of ball-release in all trials were able to detect by observing the waveforms of strains of nails. The nails at ball-release of fastball pitches mostly showed compressive strains and the strains at N had similar tendency in all participants. In slider pitches, the large strains were found at portion W of nails of all participants. From these results, it became clear that baseball pitchers had the patterns of ball-release for each type of pitch, and had the timing of joint motions in accord with each ball-release...|$|R
