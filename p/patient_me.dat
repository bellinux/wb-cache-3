40|$|In {{some human}} tumors, reduced or {{defective}} MHC class I surface expression has {{been attributed to}} functional deficiencies of the genes of the antigen-processing machinery, the proteasome subunits low molecular weight (LMP) - 2 and LMP- 7, as well as the peptide transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP) - 1 and TAP- 2, Using normal epithelial kidney cells (MZ 1851 LN) and renal cell carcinoma cell lines established from the primary tumor (MZ 1851 RC) and a lymph node metastasis (MZ 1851 LN) of the same <b>patient,</b> <b>me</b> investigated whether the modulation of MHC class I antigens, TAP and LMP molecules, occurs during transformation and subsequent progression, The mRNA and protein expression of MHC class I heavy and light chain TAP and LMP was strongly reduced in MZ 1851 RC when compared to the corresponding normal kidney cells MZ 1851 NN, and this suppression was even more pronounced in the metastatic cell line MZ 1851 LN. In addition, the activity of the TAP molecules, as measured by peptide translocation assays, was also markedly diminished in MZ 1851 RC compared to MZ 1851 NN cells and was further down-regulated in cells of the metastatic lesion, MHC class I surface expression was enhanced by either culturing MZ 1851 RC and MZ 1851 LN cells at 26 degrees C instead of 37 degrees C or by incubation of both cell lines with class I-specific binding peptides, whereas MHC class I surface expression of MZ 1851 NN cells was not affected under these culture conditions, IFN-cu and in particular IFN-gamma treatment enhances the steady-state mRNA and/or protein levels of TAP, LMP, and MHC class I genes of MZ 1851 cell lines but had no additional effect on the stability of MHC class I surface expression, These data indicate that malignant transformation and subsequent in vivo selection of renal tubular cells can lead to the recovery of carcinoma cells that show stable expression of an immune escape phenotype, Deficiencies associated with this phenotype involve all levels of the MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation machinery, are at least partially reversible by IFN treatment, and are even more pronounced in cells that had acquired metastatic potential.

In addition, the aqueous humor levels of IL- 10 and IL- 12 decreased with increasing the severity of ME. A variety of cytokines associated with inflammation and angiogenesis may contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic macular edema, and both anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic agents should be included in the treatment of ME simultaneously...|$|R

The purpose {{was to determine if}} a preventive interventions program (PIP) is associated with a significant reduction on prevalence of <b>patients</b> with <b>MEs</b> in intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: A prospective before-after study was conducted in a random sample of adult patients in a medical-surgical ICU. Between 2 observational phases, a PIP (bundle of interventions to reduce MEs) was implemented by a multidisciplinary team. Direct observation was used to detect MEs at baseline and postintervention. Each medication process, that is, prescription, transcription, dispensing, preparation, and administration, was compared with what the prescriber ordered; if there was a difference, the error was described and categorized. Medication errors were defined according to the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention. Results: A total of 410 medications for 278 patients were evaluated. A 31. 7 % decrease on the prevalence of <b>patients</b> with <b>MEs</b> (41. 9 %- 28. 6 %; P b. 05) was seen.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the stability over time of the individually defined interval of intravitreal ranibizumab injection (IVR) for the treatment of recurrent macular edema (ME) in central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Patients and Methods: A case series of treatment naïve patients followed in the Jules Gonin Eye Hospital for macular edema due to central retinal vein occlusion is presented. Patients were treated monthly with IVR until complete absence of fluid on qualitative SD-OCT with a minimum of 5 monthly IVR. Thereafter, they were followed according to a modified treat and extend regimen (mTER). Results: Twelve eyes (12 <b>patients)</b> with <b>ME</b> due to CRVO were included. The mean follow-up period was 31. 3 months. Analysis showed that best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness and qualitative spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) showed comparable results under monthly interval, after titration of an individualized interval and when performed in a series. 78  % of treating intervals were within ±[*] 2 weeks of the first individually adjusted interval. The mean first defined interval was 4. 3 weeks and the mean interval over time was 5. 5 weeks (p[*]=[*] 0. 003). There was a trend towards longer interval over time. Conclusion: The adjusted interval of retreatment of <b>patients</b> with <b>ME</b> due to CRVO showed a high stability with a trend toward longer duration over time.
