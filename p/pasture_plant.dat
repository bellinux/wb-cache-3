40|$|In recent years, {{increasing}} numbers of pathogens and pests have been reported from major centres of tropical pasture research. Damage is often severe and controls are needed. Diseases and pests may be controlled chemically, biologically, culturally and genetically. In <b>pasture</b> <b>plants</b> genetical resistance is the most practical and economical control method and, {{as a component of}} integrated pest management, has considerable potential in controlling pests. Tropical <b>pasture</b> <b>plants</b> have been artificially selected for only a short time. Vast sources of genetic variation exist in their centres of diversity. This natural variation should be utilised in selecting for resistance before initiating long term breeding programmes. Evaluation of resistance to diseases and pests of tropical <b>pasture</b> <b>plants</b> requires understanding of the plant, the pathogen or pest, the environment and their interactions. Primary germplasm evaluation for resistance in plant centres of diversity is strongly recommended and high priority should be given to understanding resistance mechanisms. The importance of multidiscipline collaborative research on resistance to diseases and pests of tropical <b>pasture</b> <b>plants</b> is stressed. Peer-reviewe...|$|R

50|$|Poa pratensis, {{commonly}} known as Kentucky bluegrass, smooth meadow-grass, or common meadow-grass, is a perennial species of grass native to practically all of Europe, northern Asia and the mountains of Algeria and Morocco. Although the species is spread over all of the cool, humid parts of the U.S., it is not native to North America. Early European colonists brought seed of Kentucky bluegrass to the New World in mixtures with other grasses. Poa pratensis forms a valuable <b>pasture</b> <b>plant,</b> characteristic of well-drained, fertile soil. It is also used for making lawns in parks and gardens and is common in cool moist climates like the northeastern United States. When found on native grasslands in North America, however, it is considered an unwelcome exotic plant, and is indicative of a disturbed and degraded landscape.|$|E

In Hay yield, the percentage of plant covered area and the rate of good type <b>pasture</b> <b>plant</b> Elmacayir Pasture was divided into three regions as First, Second and Third Region.

40|$|Pasture and {{forage plant}} {{breeding}} {{is complicated by}} the perennial nature of the plants, the diversity of environments in which improved cultivars will be used, and the complex criteria of merit involved, criteria that necessarily include some measure of impact on the efficiency of animal production. While <b>pasture</b> <b>plant</b> breeding in the temperate zone is a demonstrably productive activity, the record of success for the tropical species [...] "success" measured by release and adoption of bred cultivars [...] is less convincing, in spite of four decades of activity in numerous public sector breeding programs and a large published literature. The difference is at least partly owing to the less developed state of pasture research in general in the tropics. More specifically, the reasons for the lack of success of tropical <b>pasture</b> <b>plant</b> breeding can be classified as: i) inadequate understanding of the socioeconomic environment in which the bred cultivars are to be used, ii) inadequate level and stability of institutional support, and iii) inherent biological obstacles. It appears that in most cases the biological obstacles, while sometimes formidable, are the least constraining to success. Until responsibility for tropical <b>pasture</b> <b>plant</b> breeding is assumed by the private sector (as it largely has been in the temperate zone) the single factor that would most improve chances of success (or at least avoid many of the failures) is intimate contact and constant communication between the public sector plant breeder and the seed industry that is the vehicle for diffusion of his new bred cultivars...|$|E
