60|$|In all {{the sights}} {{to be seen}} about the world there is no sight {{in which there is}} less to be seen than in a gold-mine. The two young men were made to follow their {{conductor}} along a very dirty underground gallery for {{about a quarter of a}} mile, and then they came to four men working with picks in a rough sort of chamber, and four others driving holes in the walls. They were simply <b>picking</b> <b>down</b> the rock, in doing which they were assisted by gunpowder. With keen eyes Crinkett searched along the roof and sides, and at last showed to his companions one or two little specks which he pronounced to be gold. 'When it shows itself like that all about, you may guess whether it's a paying concern! Two ounces to the ton, my boys!' As Dick and Caldigate hitherto knew nothing about ounces and tons in reference to gold, and as they had heard of nuggets, and lumps of gold nearly as big as their fist, they were not much exalted by what they saw down the 'Old Stick-in-the-Mud.' Nor did they like the darkness and dampness and dirt and dreariness of the place. They had both resolved to work, as they had often said, with their own hands;--but in thinking over it their imagination had not pictured to them so uncomfortable a workshop as this. When they had returned to the light, the owner of the place took them through the crushing-mill attached, showed them the stone or mulloch, as it was thrust into the jaws of the devouring animal, and then brought them in triumph round to the place where the gold was eliminated from the débris of mud and water. The gold did not seem to them to be very much; but still there it was. 'Two ounces to the ton, my boys!' said Crinkett, as he brought them back to his house. 'You'll find that a 10s. share'll give you about 6d. a month. That's about 60 per cent, I guess. You can have your money monthly. What comes out of that there mine in a March, you can have in a April, and so on. There ain't nothing like it anywhere else,--not as I knows on. And instead of working your hearts out, you can be just amusing yourselves about the country. Don't go to Ahalala;--unless it is for dropping your money. If that's what you want, I won't say but Ahalala is as good a place as you'll find in the colony.' Then he brought a bottle of whisky out of a cupboard, and treated them to a glass of grog apiece. Beyond that his hospitality did not go.|$|E

5000|$|Roundwound strings have a {{bumpy surface}} profile (the bumps of the winding) that produce {{friction}} on the player's fingertips. This causes squeaking sounds when the player's fingers slide over the strings, especially when used on electric guitar with a guitar amplifier or with an acoustic guitar amplified through a PA system. (Some artists use this sound creatively, such as hardcore punk and heavy metal music electric guitarists who scrape the <b>pick</b> <b>down</b> the lower-pitched strings for an effect.) ...|$|R

50|$|An ice axe is a {{multi-purpose}} {{hiking and}} climbing tool used by mountaineers {{both in the}} ascent and descent of routes that involve frozen conditions with snow and/or ice. An ice axe can be held and employed {{in a number of}} different ways, depending on the terrain encountered. In its simplest role, the ice axe is used like a walking stick in the uphill hand, the mountaineer holding the head in the center, with the pick pointing to the rear. It can also be buried <b>pick</b> <b>down,</b> the rope tied around the shaft to form a secure anchor on which to bring up a second climber, or buried vertically to form a stomp belay. The adze is used to cut footsteps (sometimes known as pigeon holes), as well as scoop seats in the hillside and trenches to bury an ice axe belay. The long-handled alpenstock was a predecessor to the modern ice axe. The ice axe bears similarity in design to a medieval war hammer.|$|R

5000|$|Since British Steel was released, [...] "Breaking the Law" [...] {{has been}} a popular staple at some of Judas Priest's most famous {{performance}}s. The performance version of the song has changed since it was first performed on the 1981 World Wide Blitz Tour for the follow up to British Steel, Point of Entry: at first, the band would play it the original way it was on British Steel. Later, the band sometimes (for example on the Angel of Retribution tour) played the opening riff with Halford <b>picking</b> for <b>Downing,</b> <b>Downing</b> <b>picking</b> for Tipton and Tipton picking for Hill, then quickly spreading apart to their respective usual positions on {{the stage for the}} verse.
