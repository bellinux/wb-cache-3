5|$|H2 is {{a product}} of some types of {{anaerobic}} metabolism and is produced by several microorganisms, usually via reactions catalyzed by iron- or nickel-containing enzymes called hydrogenases. These enzymes catalyze the reversible redox reaction between H2 and its component two protons and two electrons. Creation of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer of reducing equivalents produced during pyruvate fermentation to water. The natural cycle of hydrogen <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> by organisms is called the hydrogen cycle.|$|E
5|$|Iridium was {{discovered}} in 1803 among insoluble impurities in natural platinum. Smithson Tennant, the primary discoverer, named iridium for the Greek goddess Iris, personification of the rainbow, because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts. Iridium {{is one of the}} rarest elements in Earth's crust, with annual <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> of only three tonnes. 191Ir and 193Ir are the only two naturally occurring isotopes of iridium, as well as the only stable isotopes; the latter is the more abundant of the two.|$|E

5|$|The {{unusually high}} {{concentration}} of oxygen gas on Earth {{is the result of}} the oxygen cycle. This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while respiration, decay, and combustion remove it from the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> occur at the same rate.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{debate about whether}} the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, and of {{the relevance of the}} Jevons paradox to energy conservation policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that it will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many environmental economists, doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards sustainability, and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumption.</b> They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use.|$|E

5|$|Indigenous peoples {{living in}} northeastern North America {{were the first}} groups known to have {{produced}} maple syrup and maple sugar.

There are no authenticated accounts of how maple syrup <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> began, but various legends exist; {{one of the most}} popular involves maple sap being used in place of water to cook venison served to a chief. Other stories credit the development of maple syrup production to Nanabozho, Glooskap, or the squirrel. Aboriginal tribes developed rituals around sugar-making, celebrating the Sugar Moon (the first full moon of spring) with a Maple Dance. Many aboriginal dishes replaced the salt traditional in European cuisine with maple sugar or syrup.|$|E

Croatia was almost exclusively a wine-consuming country up until the late 18th century when a more massive <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumption</b> of beer started; the annual consumption of beer in 2008 was 83.3litres per capita which placed Croatia in 15th place among the world's countries.|$|E
5|$|In net {{metering}} {{the price of}} the electricity produced {{is the same as the}} price supplied to the consumer, and the consumer is billed on the difference between <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumption.</b> Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard electricity meters, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With {{net metering}}, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits. Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost, or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits. In New Jersey, annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate, as are left over credits when a customer terminates service.|$|E
