5|$|Industrial {{antioxidants}} have diverse uses, {{for example}} as <b>preservatives</b> {{in food and}} cosmetics and as oxidation inhibitors in fuels.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants {{are used}} as food {{additives}} to help guard against food deterioration. Exposure to oxygen and sunlight are the two main factors in the oxidation of food, so food is preserved by keeping {{in the dark and}} sealing it in containers or even coating it in wax, as with cucumbers. However, as oxygen is also important for plant respiration, storing plant materials in anaerobic conditions produces unpleasant flavors and unappealing colors. Consequently, packaging of fresh fruits and vegetables contains an ~8% oxygen atmosphere. Antioxidants are an especially important class of <b>preservatives</b> as, unlike bacterial or fungal spoilage, oxidation reactions still occur relatively rapidly in frozen or refrigerated food. These <b>preservatives</b> include natural antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (AA, E300) and tocopherols (E306), as well as synthetic antioxidants such as propyl gallate (PG, E310), tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA, E320) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, E321).|$|E

40|$|Background: Tissue {{preservation}} can {{be performed}} through embalming, by providing the chemical embalming fluid to the human remains. Formalin’s <b>preservative</b> formula is the foundation for modern methods of embalming. Unfortunately, this <b>preservative</b> formula has several disadvantages. While Ethanol’s <b>preservative</b> formula is a considerable agent to replace formalin’s <b>preservative</b> formula. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the tissue preservation using formalin and ethanol as <b>preservative</b> formula. Methods: This study was carried out from September–October 2014 in the Laboratory of the Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran. The study used the laboratory experimental method with consecutive sampling of 16 Wistar Rats. Thirty two soleus muscles and thirty two colons were collected and divided into two groups. Each group consisted of 16 soleus muscles and 16 colons. Group 1 was preserved with formalin’s <b>preservative</b> formula and Group 2 was preserved with ethanol’s <b>preservative</b> formula. The two groups were preserved for six weeks. The tissue’s color, consistency, odor and the growth of bacteria were determined before and after treatment. Results: Tissues preserved with ethanol’s <b>preservative</b> formula had better tissue preservation in the aspect of color and odor, compared with formalin’s <b>preservative</b> formula. Both <b>preservative</b> formulas showed no growth of bacteria in tissues but failed to retain the consistency. All the data were analyzed with Chi-square test. Conclusions: Ethanol’s <b>preservative</b> formula preserves better quality of tissue compared to formalin’s <b>preservative</b> formula...|$|R

5|$|In 1801, Guinness West India Porter, {{the direct}} {{predecessor}} of Foreign Extra Stout, was first exported from the St. James's Gate brewery in Dublin. The product was formulated for Irish immigrant {{workers in the}} Caribbean. The beer was only brewed between October and April, which reduced acidification, and was matured in large wooden vats {{for up to two}} years, which gave the finished product greater stability. To survive the long journey overseas, which was then taken by ship, it was brewed with extra hops and a higher alcohol content, which acted as natural <b>preservatives</b> for the beer. Exported in barrels, the product was then bottled locally, which helped to reduce costs.|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} some studies about the wood {{permeability}} and its improving measures, some {{progress has been}} made to study the diffusion and transmission of <b>preservative</b> solutions in standing trees. In the present study, copper- (Cu-) based <b>preservative</b> with other reagents is injected into the standing tree Chinese fir using sap-flow method. The chemical compositions of the retreated woods are analyzed with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The samples from different height positions are analyzed with scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) to obtain microstructures and <b>preservative</b> retention, respectively. The results indicate that the <b>preservative</b> solutions with lower concentrations are more conducive to diffusion and transmission in the wood. Moreover, the <b>preservative</b> retention at different height position has a greater concentration gradient for composite <b>preservative</b> solutions than those of the single <b>preservative</b> solutions.

5|$|In 1820 Accum {{began the}} public {{struggle}} against harmful food additives with his book entitled A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons. Some additives derived from plants, {{and used as}} <b>preservatives</b> or to alter tastes or appearance, had already been in use for some time. The beginning of the 19th century saw a rapid increase in the industrial preparation and packaging of foods. The drastic increase of additives used in these processes became a serious health concern. The production and distribution of food, instead of being one between local farmers and townspeople, increasingly became a centralized process in large factories. The proliferation of newly discovered chemicals {{and the absence of}} laws moderating their use, made it possible for unscrupulous merchants to use them to boost profits at a cost to the public health. Accum was the first to publicly proclaim the hazards of this practice and to reach a wide audience with his concerns.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman era, copper was principally mined on Cyprus, {{the origin}} of the name of the metal, from aes сyprium (metal of Cyprus), later {{corrupted}} to сuprum, from which the words copper (English), cuivre (French), Koper (Dutch) and Kupfer (German) are all derived. The commonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite, malachite, and turquoise, and have been used widely and historically as pigments. Copper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green verdigris (or patina). Copper is sometimes used in decorative art, both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents, fungicides, and wood <b>preservatives.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{molecules}} attacked by oxidation are unsaturated fats; oxidation {{causes them to}} turn rancid. Since oxidized lipids are often discolored and usually have unpleasant tastes such as metallic or sulfurous flavors, {{it is important to}} avoid oxidation in fat-rich foods. Thus, these foods are rarely preserved by drying; instead, they are preserved by smoking, salting or fermenting. Even less fatty foods such as fruits are sprayed with sulfurous antioxidants prior to air drying. Oxidation is often catalyzed by metals, which is why fats such as butter should never be wrapped in aluminium foil or kept in metal containers. Some fatty foods such as olive oil are partially protected from oxidation by their natural content of antioxidants, but remain sensitive to photooxidation. Antioxidant <b>preservatives</b> are also added to fat based cosmetics such as lipstick and moisturizers to prevent rancidity.|$|E

5|$|Techniques to {{preserve}} birds were attempted {{even from the}} early 16th century {{as shown in the}} writings of Conrad Gesner and Pierre Belon. Belon provided instructions on the removal of viscera and the use of salt {{to preserve}} bird specimens in his 1555 book on birds. These were further improved in the 17th century and a range of <b>preservatives</b> included ash (potassium carbonate), salt, sulphur, alum, alcohol and various plant extracts were used. In the early days of bird collections, most specimens were mounted in unrealistic positions often with their wings raised as if they were about to take flight. These were kept in the open and the colours were prone to fading and the specimens themselves prone to damage by beetles. In Berlin, J. L. Frisch started using tightly enclosed glass jars for every mount to prevent pest damage. During this time, Comte de Reaumur at the Paris Museum had managed to find techniques to preserve specimens dry and without loss of colour. This technique was however a secret and similar results were later achieved by pickling using salt, ground pepper and alum and drying for a month with threads holding the bird in a natural position. The use of arsenic to preserve specimens was first introduced by Jean-Baptiste Bécoeur (1718-1777) but this method was publicly revealed only in 1800 by Louis Dufresne in Daudin's Traité Élémentaire et Complet d’Ornithologie (1800). In modern collections, salvaged or collected birds may be preserved in a number of ways. The most traditional preparation is a study skin, in which almost all of the body inside the skin is removed and replaced with cotton so that the final result resembles a bird lying on its back with its wings folded. Borax is used as the preferred preservative as it is low in toxicity. This stereotypic posture was developed to enable many skins to be kept together in cabinets to protect them from insect and light damage. If a complete skeleton is desired, a flat skin may be prepared: all bones, muscle, digestive and other soft tissue is carefully removed and the feathers and skin are stretched flat and dried.|$|E
