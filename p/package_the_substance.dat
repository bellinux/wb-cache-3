At first, Kier simply dumped the useless {{oil into the}} nearby Pennsylvania Main Line Canal, but after an oil slick caught fire, he saw a way to profit from this otherwise worthless byproduct. With no formal training in science or chemistry, he began experimenting with several distillates of the crude oil along with a chemist from eastern Pennsylvania. He developed a substance he named [...] "Rock Oil" [...] and later [...] "Seneca Oil". In 1848, he began <b>packaging</b> <b>the</b> <b>substance</b> as a patent medicine charging $0.50 per bottle. He also produced petroleum butter (petroleum jelly) and sold it as a topical ointment. [...] Neither product {{proved to be a}} commercial success.|$|R
40|$|Studies of the {{migration}} of benzophenone from inks and of model ink components incorporated deliberately into cartonboard {{have been carried out}} at low temperature and during microwave heating. Benzophenone was found in <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> of four of seven frozen foods examined and this was attributed to its use as a photoinitiator for UV-cured ink. Benzophenone was found to migrate to <b>the</b> <b>packaged</b> food even from polyethylene-coated board, and this was attributed in part to the fact that polyethylene is rather permeable to low molecular weight substances and is not a good barrier to migration. Additional studies were conducted with two other frozen foods by incorporating model ink components into their cartonboard <b>packaging.</b> <b>The</b> <b>substances</b> were benzophenone, benzylbutyl phthalate, butyl benzoate, chlorodecane and dimethyl phthalate. Migration was readily detected after storing the food at - 20 °C for 1 week in the impregnated cartonboard. Migration levels in the food increased only slowly thereafter, up to 1 year, except for <b>the</b> most volatile <b>substances</b> used. Subsequent heating of the frozen food using a microwave oven decreased the concentration of some migrants by volatilization, but increased the concentration of other, less volatile substances by heat-accelerated migration. It is concluded that for inks used to print food contact materials, if the content of low molecular weight volatiles is controlled and if transfer of higher molecular weight components via set-off is controlled also, then migration levels could be kept low in these conditions...|$|R

With respect to packing and trade processes the definition of the system boundaries between packed good and packaging system proved to be very important. In the section 'packing' unit processes for printing, labelling and rinsing (three variants) of packaging are developed and documented with data. For the life-cycle step 'trade' unit processes for commissionning and storing with and without cooling are displayed. The environmental impacts caused by the consumer are basically described by the unit process for rinsing. For this unit process the corresponding data are documented. (orig.)

40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids deals with the safety evaluation of a system based on Carnobacterium maltaromaticum and a colour change indicator, acid fuchsin (CAS number 3244 - 88 - 0, FCM Substance No 01033), used as a time-temperature indicator on <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> of chilled food. The micro-organism, the indicator and a nutritive medium gel are incorporated in a multilayer plastic sachet glued onto the outer layer of <b>the</b> food <b>package.</b> All <b>the</b> <b>substances</b> constituting <b>the</b> system, {{with the exception of}} acid fuchsin, are authorised as food additives, food colorants or novel food ingredients, or are an enzymatic digest of edible protein sources and yeast edible extract. Specific migration of acid fuchsin was estimated to be less than 7 x 10 - 9 mg/kg food. Acid fuchsin elicited a positive response in a bacterial gene mutation assay and a negative response in an in vitro micronucleus assay. Given the lack of in vivo studies, the genotoxicity potential of acid fuchsin cannot be ruled out. However, the Panel noted that the layer of the plastic sachet in contact with food contact articles behaves as a barrier which prevents any release of its content (including acid fuchsin), and that the sachet is stuck onto the outer layer of <b>the</b> <b>packaging,</b> hence is not in contact with the food. Thus no exposure to <b>the</b> <b>substances</b> constituting <b>the</b> system from the consumption of the packed food is expected under the intended conditions of use. Therefore, the Panel concluded that <b>the</b> <b>substances</b> of <b>the</b> intelligent system, C. maltaromaticum and acid fuchsin, do not raise a safety concern for the consumer when used in a plastic sachet which prevents any migration from the system into food and which is stuck onto the outer layer of <b>the</b> <b>packaging</b> of chilled food...|$|R

40|$|The article {{examines}} whether the business judgment rule allows courts {{to review the}} substantive wisdom of decisions made by corporate directors.

Background: As {{result of}} the {{restructuring}} of the South African Police Services during 1994 {{as well as other}} factors, Police Social Work Services decided to shift the focus from reactive services to more proactive, personnel capacity building programmes. At the end of 1999, 15 of these programmes were already developed. Although basic evaluation instruments were included in some of <b>the</b> programme <b>packages,</b> <b>the</b> need arose to determine either the effect of the programmes on the participants or the cost-efficiency of the interventions scientifically. This led to the launch of the PCBP project and the Evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>Substance</b> Dependency study in November 2001. This form part of the evaluation of the comprehensive personnel capacity building research project. Objectives: The primary aim {{of the study was to}} determine the effect of <b>the</b> <b>Substance</b> Dependency Programme on SAPS personnel's knowledge, attitude and behaviour. Method: In the research, the comparison group pre-test and post-test design and triangulation were used.

Results: Through the triangulation of measurement it was determined that <b>the</b> <b>Substance</b> Dependence Programme had a practical significant effect on the respondent's knowledge, attitude and behaviour.
