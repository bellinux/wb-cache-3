40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} coupon structure on the financial behavior of Individual Investors in the fixed-income market. Examining circa 26 million decisions on 204 standard putable bonds with different coupon offerings our major findings are: (i) Products with a flat coupon structure and a high duration attract fewer investors and are significantly more often exercised early, whereas financially equal products with a steeply rising coupon structure arouse more interest among investors and are less often redeemed early. (ii) The shape of the upcoming coupon structure is an important basis on which investors decide which <b>putable</b> <b>bond</b> in a portfolio to exercise early. (iii) Issuers who exploit empirical patterns related to a bond 4 s coupon structure through "behavioral financial engineering" can benefit from a lower liquidity demand and a diminishing empirical option value...|$|E
40|$|We propose an {{efficient}} method to evaluate callable and putable bonds under a wide class of interest rate models, including the popular short rate diffusion models, {{as well as}} their time changed versions with jumps. The method is based on the eigenfunction expansion of the pricing operator. Given the set of call and put dates, the callable and <b>putable</b> <b>bond</b> pricing function is the value function of a stochastic game with stopping times. Under some technical conditions, it is shown to have an eigenfunction expansion in eigenfunctions of the pricing operator with the expansion coefficients determined through a backward recursion. For popular short rate diffusion models, such as CIR, Vasicek, 3 / 2, the method is orders of magnitude faster than the alternative approaches in the literature. In contrast to the alternative approaches in the literature that have so far been limited to diffusions, the method is equally applicable to short rate jump-diffusion and pure jump models constructed from diffusion models by Bochner's subordination with a Lévy subordinator...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Risk Analysis)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. This thesis aims to {{illustrate}} how real options embedded in business concerns may be identified and quantified for valuation purposes. Traditionally, Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Net Present Value (NPV) techniques are central to valuation under uncertainty. However, option pricing-theory, applied to real or non-financial assets, is introduced {{as a means of}} bridging the gap between real world valuation practicalities and standard theory. This central theme is complemented by the valuation of the process patent and plant breeder rights held by Peppadew International (Pty) Ltd. The real option valuation is conducted in conjunction with an independent valuation of Peppadew by the accounting firm KPMG. Keeping the options analysis in line with the generally accepted and well-understood NPV methodology, renders it intuitively understandable and acceptable to managers and investors alike. The first part of the study illustrates that standard NPV analysis alone is an inadequate valuation tool in the presence of real assets. Valuing the process patent and plant breeder rights of Peppadew International by means of a real option analysis highlights the fact that some inherent value remains unaccounted for by traditional methods. The company was undervalued when applying the Discounted Cash Flow model only - not because the expected cash flows were too low, but simply because the model ignores the options that the company has, via its patents and breeder rights, to increase future investment and take advantage of business success. Specifically, the real option analysis of Peppadew demonstrates that uncertainty can create va!ue. The second part of this study illustrates how the results from the real options analysis of Peppadew International may be applied to engineer an enhanced funding strategy for the company. Specific requirements are set forth by a large governmental lender and these requirements are met through a uniquely stmctured <b>putable</b> <b>bond</b> for Peppadew. The findings of this study emphasise that strategists, analysts and valuation experts can no longer overlook real options as an analysis tool. Identifying real options not only adds substantial economic value but also introduces a paradigm shift in understanding flexibility, i. e. the ability to successfully adapt to unforeseen changes as uncertainty unfolds. The overall result of this work is a clear and logic demonstration of how real option analysis is an extension (to non-financial assets) {{of the ways in which}} financial markets value options on stocks or shares.

50|$|Some {{corporate}} bonds have an embedded call option {{that allows the}} issuer to redeem the debt before its maturity date. These are called callable bonds. A less common feature is an embedded put option that allows investors to put the bond back to the issuer before its maturity date. These are called <b>putable</b> <b>bonds.</b> Both of these features are common to the High Yield market. High Grade bonds rarely have embedded options. A straight bond that is neither callable nor putable is called a bullet bond.|$|R
50|$|Puttable <b>bond</b> (put <b>bond,</b> <b>putable</b> or {{retractable}} <b>bond)</b> is a {{bond with}} an embedded put option.

(ii) Only {{a small fraction of}} attractive exercise opportunities are exploited over time.

40|$|This {{paper is}} the first to analyze and value early {{exercises}} of Individual Investors in fixed-income investment products. Assuming decision and transaction costs we consider that a continuous decision-making on holding or exercising is not optimal anymore and propose a new approach to modeling exercise decisions, which endogenously determines the optimal decision strategy. Calibrating our model to a unique data set of about 880, 000 early exercises in non-tradable <b>putable</b> <b>bonds</b> over a time period of 13 years indicates that Individual Investors (i) act very heterogeneously, (ii) behave as if they face significant individual transaction and decision costs, (iii) react sluggishly, and that (iv) exogenous effects such as taxes or investors 4 desire for liquidity additionally influence early exercise behavior...|$|R

Here, the bond is priced as a [...] "straight bond" [...] (i.e. as if it had no embedded features) and the option is valued using the Black Scholes formula. The option value is then added to the straight bond price if the optionality rests with the buyer of the bond; it is subtracted if the seller of the bond (i.e. the issuer) may choose to exercise. http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-414-financial-management-summer-2003/lecture-notes/lec20_options2.pdf http://www.numa.com/derivs/ref/calculat/cb/calc-cbb.htm http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/inv2ed/ill33p6.xls For convertible and exchangeable bonds, a more sophisticated approach is to model the instrument as a [...] "coupled system" [...] comprising an equity component and a debt component, each with different default risks; see Lattice model (finance)#Hybrid Securities.|$|R

The approach for bond options is described aside—note that this approach addresses the problem of pull to par experienced under closed form approaches; see [...] For swaptions the logic is almost identical, substituting swaps for bonds in step 1, and swaptions for bond options in step 2. For caps (and floors) step 1 and 2 are combined: at each node the value {{is based on the}} relevant nodes at the later step, plus, for any caplet (floorlet) maturing in the time-step, the difference between its reference-rate and the short-rate at the node (and reflecting the corresponding day count fraction and notional-value exchanged). For callable- and <b>putable</b> <b>bonds</b> a third step would be required: at each node in the time-step incorporate the effect of the embedded option on the bond price and / or the option price there before stepping-backwards one time-step. (And noting that these options are not mutually exclusive, and so a bond may have several options embedded; hybrid securities are treated below.) For other, more exotic interest rate derivatives, similar adjustments are made to steps 1 and onward.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first empirical analysis of firms' rationale for issuing <b>putable</b> convertible <b>bonds</b> in the literature. We distinguish between three possible rationales for {{the issuance of}} putable convertibles: 1) the risk-shifting hypothesis, 2) the asymmetric information hypothesis, and 3) the tax savings hypothesis. The results of our empirical analysis can be summarized as follows. First, putable convertible issuers are larger, less risky firms, having larger cash flows, smaller growth opportunities, and lower bankruptcy probabilities as compared to ordinary convertible issuers. Second, putable convertible issuers have lower preissue market valuations, more favorable announcement effects, and better postissue operating performance when compared to ordinary convertible issuers. Third, putable convertible issuers have better postissue long-run stock return performance as compared to ordinary convertible issuers. Finally, putable convertible issuers typically have greater tax obligations and better credit ratings than ordinary convertible issuers. Overall, {{the results of our}} univariate as well as multivariate analyses provide support for the asymmetric information and tax savings hypotheses, but little support for the risk-shifting hypothesis.

40|$|The Liquid Yield Option Note (LYON), {{created by}} Merrill Lynch, {{is a highly}} {{successful}} financial innovation. LYON is a zero-coupon, callable, <b>putable</b> and convertible <b>bond.</b> None {{of the features of}} a LYON is new. It is their combination which appeals to investors and issuers. The McConnell and Schwartz (1986) model was the first {{to address the issue of}} pricing LYONs. Besides other assumptions, the model assumes that the LYON can be converted into common stock unconditionally, and no interest is paid on these bonds. However, for many LYONs trading today, their convertibility into common stock is conditional upon the issuer’s stock price crossing certain prescribed thresholds during certain periods of time. Also, many LYONs pay interest, contingent upon the price of the LYON again crossing certain prescribed thresholds. The McConnell and Schwartz (1986) pricing model does not address these issues. We extend the original model to take into account the issues of conditional convertibility and contingent interest. Also, we incorporate the default risk of the issuer in the model differently from how it was done in the McConnell and Schwartz (1986) model...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises three essays. In {{the first}} essay, I develop a contingent-claims model {{to investigate the}} impact of managerial entrenchment on corporate policies and security valuation. The model emphasizes the role that managerial agency issues play in determining both a firm's dividend payout and capital structure. I show quantitatively that self-interested managers' leverage choices deviate from those ex ante maximize firm values. The results suggest that dividend yields are negatively affected by both leverage ratios and managerial entrenchment. They provide implications for empirical research attempting to relate dividend policy to capital structure. In addition, the model offers a new framework to measure managerial entrenchment using observed leverage and dividend payout. In the second essay, we use a set of structural models to evaluate the price of default protection for a sample of US corporations. In contrast to previous evidence from corporate bond data, CDS premia are not systematically underestimated. In fact, one of our studied models has little difficulty on average in predicting their level. For robustness, we perform the same exercise for bond spreads by the same issuers on the same trading date. As expected, bond spreads relative to the Treasury curve are systematically underestimated, consistent with their being driven by significant non-default components. This {{is not the case}} when the swap curve is used as a benchmark, suggesting that previously documented underestimation results may be sensitive to the choice of risk free rate. In the third essay, we develop a valuation model that simultaneously captures credit risk and interest rate risk, and apply it to study the valuation of <b>putable</b> corporate <b>bonds.</b> We ask what risks put features provide insurance against in practice - credit risk, liquidity risk or interest rate risk - and to what degree? We find that they reduce the components of all three risks in bond spreads. The most important, perhaps surprisingly is default or spread risk, followed by term structure risk. The reduction in the liquidity component is present but rather small...|$|R

In the first essay titled 2 ̆ 2 Extending the LYONs pricing Model 2 ̆ 2, we extend the McConnell and Schwartz (1986) model for pricing liquid yield option notes (LYONs). LYONs are zero-coupon, callable, <b>putable</b> and {{convertible}} <b>bonds.</b> The McConnell and Schwartz model {{assumes that the}} LYONs can be converted into common stock unconditionally, and no interest is paid on these bonds.

Also, many LYONs pay interest, contingent upon {{the price of the}} LYON again crossing certain prescribed thresholds. The McConnell and Schwartz pricing model does not address these issues. We extend their model {{to take into account the}} issues of conditional convertibility and contingent interest, and also treat default risk differently. ^ In the second essay titled 2 ̆ 2 Pricing Securities with Multiple Risks: An Empirical Study 2 ̆ 2, we test the empirical performance of the Das and Sundaram (2006) model. This model is for the pricing of securities faced with equity, interest rate and credit risks. After showing how various inputs to the model can be estimated, we first apply the model to a sample of non-convertible bonds in the American and the European markets. ^ Then we show how the Das and Sundaram model can be extended to price convertible bonds which have a peculiar conversion feature; these bonds are convertible not into the stock of the bond issuer, but into the stock of a different company. We also test the empirical performance of this extended model. ^ In the third essay titled 2 ̆ 2 An Empirical Comparison of Two Simple Models for Valuing Risky Debt 2 ̆ 2, we compare the empirical performance of the Longstaff and Schwartz (1995) model and the Das and Sundaram (2006) model. The Das and Sundaram model is for valuing both convertible debt and non-convertible debt, whereas the Longstaff and Swchartz model is for valuing only non-convertible debt. The interesting feature of the Longstaff and Schwartz model is that it provides a closed-form solution. We test the relative performance of these two models on a sample of non-convertible bonds. ...|$|R
