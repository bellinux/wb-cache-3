40|$|In {{the present}} thesis the {{evaluation}} of the structural behaviour of ancient timber elements subjected to bending and axial forces has been investigated. Such type of structures represented the bearing structure of floor and trust of buildings of the Italian and Mediterranean historical centres. More particularly, this study is focused on the typical timber floors of the buildings realized until {{the first years of the}} twentieth century. Such timber structures are often constituted by natural beams of chestnut, larch, fir or spruce having circular or square cross-sections. In the case of simple floor typologies, the only beam frame was directly leaned on perimeter walls, with a 4 - 5 m span length at a distance on center of 50 - 80 cm, with a superposed secondary wood elements and filler materials. With the composite floor typologies, thanks to the double frame of principal floor beams, it was possible to cover longer spans-length. Anyway, generally, beams were set up without providing any special treatment. Therefore, they present remarkable shape defects and a considerable cross-section variation between the end-beams. It is worth noting that these structural members present the major calculation uncertainties on theoretical bases, due to the strong influence of the behavioural response exercised by knots and structural defects. A wide experimental campaign based on a series of ancient chestnut beams in actual dimension have been carried out. First of all, a preliminary visual inspection have been executed on the timber elements, in order to have an exhaustive relief of the actual geometry of the beams, the quality of wood and the deterioration state conditions. Later the main physical and mechanical properties of the base material has been determined. In particular, the moisture content and the density have been determined together with the elastic and <b>post-elastic</b> <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour</b> of wood. Compressive (in longitudinal and transversal direction), bending and shear tests on defect-free small specimens extracted from the members have been carried out in order to obtain the compressive strength, the longitudinal elastic modulus, the tensile resistance and the shear strength. These properties have been successively compared with the one obtained by means of full-scale tests on timber elements in actual dimension. 	Next phase of the research program concerns {{the evaluation of}} the structural behaviour of ancient timber elements subjected to full-scale static tests. Such type of elements present many calculation uncertainties due to the presence of not negligible degradation phenomena which can produce a strong reduction of the load bearing capacity. This experimental activity is based on a series of compressive and bending tests. In particular, compressive tests were carried out on three timber elements previously subjected to Non-destructive Resistographic analyses, while bending tests have been performed on four beams of about 4 m span length. They have been tested according to two different loading condition (three and four-point bending tests) as indicated in international regulations. Some interesting considerations have been made on their partially unexpected failure mechanism. Later, an experimental campaign on samples jointed by means of metal fasteners has been discussed. First, embedding tests in longitudinal and transversal direction have been carried out on ancient chestnut samples, in order to determine the embedment strength of the material. In addition, a series of bending tests on connected timber beams in small dimension have been performed. Tests were executed according to the same loading conditions used for bending tests on small and actual whole beams. Several differences in the cross-section dimensions and in the number of the metal connectors have been analysed. Next experimental phase refers to Non-Destructive Tests (NDT) on chestnut members. In particular, Resistographic analyses have been carried out on the samples successively used for full-scale compressive tests. A large number of local drilling measures have been executed on such elements both in longitudinal and transversal direction, in order to have in-depth information. Several considerations have been made on the correlation between longitudinal and transversal measures, which are the ones commonly operable in the in situ investigations. In addition, comparison between longitudinal analyses and the corresponding compressive strength have been investigated. In order to guarantee a more reliable correlation between destructive and nondestructive tests, Resistographic analyses and compressive tests have been carried out also on spruce defect-free small specimens, obtained from classified spruce beams usually available in commerce. By means of these analyses a correlation curve has been determined, which allow to deduce the mechanical properties of wood exclusively by means of Resistographic analyses...|$|E

40|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} bridges with {{corrugated steel}} webs {{have emerged as}} one of the promising bridge forms. However, the presence of prestressing tendons and shear-deformable corrugated steel webs with negligible axial stiffness complicates the formation of plastic hinges under applied loading to failure. The full-range <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour</b> of these bridges and plastic hinge formation are therefore studied experimentally and numerically. The more localised flange plastic hinge caused by both web shear deformation and local flange bending interacts with the full-depth plastic hinge of such a bridge.

Statical calculations and simulations are carried out in order to investigate the principal statical behaviour of masonry vaults and also in order to get information about the state of prevalent empirical and theoretical knowledge, design methods and construction methods. Historical research subjects are: the oriental barrel-vaults, the construction process and the <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour</b> of Roman domes in composite design, a comparative study of the <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour</b> of Byzantine and Ottoman pendentif domes, <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour</b> and <b>structural</b> design of barrel vaults from Renaissance, <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour</b> of ovaloid domes in the late Baroque period, the early application of special forms with statical implication to domes. Traditional thrustline-methods as well as nonlinear finite-element-methods are applied to the statical investigations. The load case of main interest is 'deadload'. Thrustline-methods help to investigate problems of formfinding and to evaluate different forms of vaults with special statistical characteristics. The features of the catenary in general terms, i. e. for other load configurations than uniformal distributed loads, are discussed. The finite-element-method allows the simulation of cracking of brittle material and the investigation of the change of the stress distribution in masonry structures due to the materially nonlinear behaviour. The mechanical parameters of historical masonry and their application to nonlinear finite-element-analysis are discussed particularly. The simulation results are verified by means of basic mechanical models. Finally some of the typical features of the cracking behaviour of simple masonry structures are pointed out. (orig.)

40|$|The {{influence}} of the load history on the <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour</b> and capacity of some statically indeterminate reinforced concrete frames was investigated, {{through the use of}} nonlinear finite element analyses (NLFEA). The <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour</b> was evaluated in terms of ultimate capacity, development of crack regions, yielding of reinforcement, and closing of cracks. Initially, a nonlinear model of the frames was established by performing a case study on a well documented experiment, and comparing analysis results to experimental data. Further, the established model was analysed in a series of virtual experiments, where three different loading paths were investigated. These three involved application of vertical and horizontal loads proportionally, and in sequence by varying which load was applied first. Also different ratios between the two loads were tested for each load path. The established model was proved to give sufficiently good predictions for the ultimate capacity and the overall <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour.</b> However, the model behaved overly stiff in the initial phase of the analysis, which resulted in rather wrong predictions of the deflections. The reason for this behaviour could have been due to time dependent effects like drying-related shrinkage and so on. The virtual experiments provided a thorough study of the <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the frames under different loading paths. Expected <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour,</b> and differences in <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour</b> between the load paths, were observed. This was in terms of crack development, yielding of reinforcement, and closure of cracks resulting from changing direction of loading. The capacities differed somewhat between the load paths, though less than what was expected prior to conducting the analyses. The largest differences in capacity were found for large horizontal loads, relative to vertical loads. Hence, the load path with first application of the horizontal load resulted in the lowest capacity. It was believed that the small differences in capacity could be a result of the chosen material models, {{and the fact that the}} full compressive strength of the concrete normal to the cracks, was restored upon crack closure. This was further investigated through two benchmark studies, and the results showed that a simple structure which had observed crack closure, showed an increase in strength and ductility, relative to a structure which had not experienced crack closure. This was an interesting finding, and further research investigating the mechanisms behind this increase in strength and ductility would be valuable...|$|R
40|$|Progressive {{collapse}} is {{a situation}} when local failure is followed by collapse of adjoining members, which in turn causes global collapse, threatening life. Local failure of a vertical load carrying member, {{can be caused by}} abnormal loading such as explosion, bombing, sudden vehicle impact and design errors. The design of structures against progressive collapse has not been an integral part of structural design. It is difficult to predict the <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour</b> of building members during progressive collapse because of the dynamic nature of the event and the limited experimental tests conducted {{to understand the nature of}} progressive collapse. An experimental program comprising eight reinforced concrete (RC) beam-column sub-assemblages is presented to investigate the <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour</b> and progressive collapse resistance of RC frame members subjected to column removal scenario (CRS). The specimens were tested under quasi-static loading. Mitigation of progressive collapse has become a primary concern of engineers in recent years. A new mitigation scheme is proposed in this study to increase the resistance of RC beams against progressive collapse using modified detailing of reinforcement. The effect of the proposed scheme on the <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour</b> of sub-assemblages is investigated through testing some of the specimens with modified detailing. The test results showed that the proposed scheme was able and efficient to increase progressive collapse capacity. A finite element (FE) model was developed using the software package ANSYS in order to numerically simulate the <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour</b> of RC beam-column sub-assemblages under CRS. A macro-model based approach was used in the analysis using beam elements and a series of non-linear springs to capture the real <b>behaviour</b> of <b>structural</b> members associated with the redistribution of loads under CRS.

An analytical model was developed to predict the <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour</b> of RC structures under CRS.

Steel bar fracture and the reduction in the effective beam depth due to concrete crushing were included in the model. The model was validated by comparing the results with the experimental results.

In addition to experimental studies, the modelling of textile reinforced concrete plays a significant role. In contrast to monolithic reinforcing elements in steel reinforced concrete, the reinforcing textile structures show a high heterogeneity.

It should be noted that while the shear connections in standard tests were under direct shear forces, the shear connections in modified tests were under co-existing shear and tension forces. For direct comparison, the measured load-slippage curves of these shear connections were rationalized to provide representative load-deformation characteristics of the connections which exhibited various degrees of ductility at both small and large deformations.

40|$|The {{long-term}} <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour</b> and buckling of a concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) arch under sustained loading {{are very}} much related to creep and shrinkage of its concrete core. The creep and shrinkage of the concrete core will produce time-dependent structural deformations and change equilibrium configuration of the CFST arch under sustained loading, which may even lead to the long-term failure of the arch. A CFST arch that is stable {{in the short term}} may buckle under sustained loading in the long term and fail in a limit point instability mode or a bifurcation instability mode. Hence, it is vital and essential to understand the long-term behaviour and stability of CFST arches by accounting for time-variant viscoelastic features and different working conditions and develop an applicable strategy of estimating the long-term <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour</b> and buckling for ensuring the safety and serviceability of CFST arches. This dissertation aims to develop linear and nonlinear analytical frameworks for predicting the long-term <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour</b> and buckling of CFST arches under various circumstances. Virtual work methods are used to establish the differential equations of equilibrium and the age-adjusted effective modulus method is employed to address the creep issue of the concrete core. Different types of boundary conditions and loading cases are systematically addressed in this dissertation. Closed-form solutions for the linear and nonlinear long-term behaviour and buckling of CFST arches under various circumstances have been obtained. It is found that geometric nonlinearity plays a significant role in correctly predicting the long-term <b>structural</b> <b>behaviour</b> and stability of CFST arches. A finite element model is also developed for the long-term analysis of CFST arches and can be used to validate the analytical solutions and to perform the long-term analysis of CFST arches with general load and boundary conditions.
