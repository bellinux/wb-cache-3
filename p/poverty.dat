5|$|States that {{rejected}} the Medicaid expansion could maintain their Medicaid eligibility thresholds, which {{in many states}} were significantly below 133% of the <b>poverty</b> line. Many states did not make Medicaid available to childless adults at any income level. Because subsidies on exchange insurance plans were not available to those below the <b>poverty</b> line, such individuals had no new options. For example, in Kansas, where only able-bodied adults with children and with an income below 32% of the <b>poverty</b> line were eligible for Medicaid, those with incomes from 32% to 100% of the <b>poverty</b> level ($6,250 to $19,530 {{for a family of}} three) were ineligible for both Medicaid and federal subsidies to buy insurance. Absent children, able-bodied adults were not eligible for Medicaid in Kansas.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, the Census Bureau {{introduced}} a new supplemental <b>poverty</b> measure aimed at providing a more accurate picture of the true extent of <b>poverty</b> in the United States.

25|$|The <b>poverty</b> line {{threshold}} of $1.90 per day, as {{set by the}} World Bank, is controversial.

Some scholars argue that the World Bank method sets the bar too high, others argue it is low. Still others suggest that <b>poverty</b> line misleads as it measures everyone below the <b>poverty</b> line the same, when in reality someone living on $1.20 per day is in a different state of <b>poverty</b> than someone living on $0.20 per day. In other words, the depth and intensity of <b>poverty</b> varies across the world and in any regional populations, and $1.25 per day <b>poverty</b> line and head counts are inadequate measures.|$|E
