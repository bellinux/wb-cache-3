5|$|Herrerasaurus {{displays}} {{traits that}} are found in different groups of dinosaurs, and several traits found in non-dinosaurian archosaurs. Although it shares most {{of the characteristics of}} dinosaurs, there are a few differences, particularly in the shape of its hip and leg bones. Its pelvis is like that of saurischian dinosaurs, but it has a bony acetabulum (where the femur meets the pelvis) that was only partially open. The ilium, the main hip bone, is supported by only two sacrals, a basal trait. However, the <b>pubis</b> points backwards, a derived trait as seen in dromaeosaurids and birds. Additionally, the end of the <b>pubis</b> has a booted shape, like those in avetheropods; and the vertebral centra has an hourglass shape as found in Allosaurus.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Ostrom {{published}} another monograph on {{the shoulder}} of Deinonychus in which he realized that the <b>pubis</b> that he had described was actually a coracoid– a shoulder element. In that same year, another specimen of Deinonychus, MCZ 4371, was discovered and excavated in Montana by Steven Orzack during a Harvard University expedition headed by Farish Jenkins. This discovery added several new elements: well preserved femurs, pubes, a sacrum, and better ilia, as well as elements of the pes and metatarsus. Ostrom described this specimen and revised his skeletal restoration of Deinonychus. This time it showed the very long <b>pubis,</b> and Ostrom began to suspect that they may have even been a little retroverted like those of birds.|$|E
5|$|The known {{material}} {{includes two}} cervical vertebrae, nine dorsal vertebrae, a few ribs, {{a fragment of}} a <b>pubis,</b> and many gastroliths. Of the material, only the vertebrae are diagnostic, with the ribs and <b>pubis</b> being too fragmentary or general to distinguish Dinheirosaurus. This material was first described as in the genus Lourinhasaurus, but differences were noticed and in 1999 Bonaparte and Mateus redescribed the material under the new binomial Dinheirosaurus lourinhanensis. Another specimen, ML 418, thought to be Dinheirosaurus, is now known to be from another Portuguese diplodocid. This means that Dinheirosaurus lived alongside many theropods, sauropods, thyreophorans and ornithopods, {{as well as at}} least one other diplodocid.|$|E

5|$|Dinheirosaurus is {{not known}} well from non-vertebral material, {{currently}} only consisting of partial ribs and a fragment of a pelvis. One of the ribs attached to the cervicals, and is quite fragmentary. It is elongated, although {{that might be a}} feature of distortion. Also undescribed by Bonaparte & Mateus are a set of thoratic ribs. Two ribs are from {{the left side of the}} animal. They are T-shaped in cross section, and display plesiomorphic features, although their incomplete state makes their identification uncertain. Multiple right ribs are preserved, including both the shafts and heads. They are similar to the left ribs, which also show that they lack pneumtization. Other appendicular (non-vertebral) material includes a very incomplete and fragmentary shaft of the <b>pubis,</b> and over one hundred gastroliths. The <b>pubis</b> displays practically no anatomical features, and the gastroliths were not described in detail by Mannion et al. in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Nesbitt found {{a number}} of further {{potential}} synapomorphies, and discounted {{a number of}} synapomorphies previously suggested. Some of these are also present in silesaurids, which Nesbitt recovered as a sister group to Dinosauria, including a large anterior trochanter, metatarsals II and IV of subequal length, reduced contact between ischium and <b>pubis,</b> {{the presence of a}} cnemial crest on the tibia and of an ascending process on the astragalus, and many others.|$|E
5|$|Because {{feathers}} {{are often}} associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the missing link between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence for paleontologists.

5|$|Developmental biology can {{identify}} homologous structures that {{arose from the}} same tissue in embryogenesis. For example, adult snakes have no legs, but their early embryos have limb-buds for hind legs, which are soon lost as the embryos develop. The implication that the ancestors of snakes had hind legs is confirmed by fossil evidence: the Cretaceous snake Pachyrhachis problematicus had hind legs complete with hip bones (ilium, <b>pubis,</b> ischium), thigh bone (femur), leg bones (tibia, fibula) and foot bones (calcaneum, astragalus) as in tetrapods with legs today.|$|E
5|$|Though {{a myriad}} of bones was {{available}} by 1969, many important ones were missing or hard to interpret. There were few postorbital skull elements, no femurs, no sacrum, no furcula or sternum, missing vertebrae, and (Ostrom thought) only a tiny fragment of a coracoid. Ostrom's skeletal reconstruction of Deinonychus included a very unusual pelvic bone– a <b>pubis</b> that was trapezoidal and flat, unlike that of other theropods, but which was the same length as the ischium and which was found right next to it.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsia {{was coined}} by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1890 to include dinosaurs {{possessing}} certain characteristic features, including horns, a rostral bone, teeth with two roots, fused neck vertebrae, and a forward-oriented <b>pubis.</b> Marsh considered the group distinct {{enough to warrant}} its own suborder within Ornithischia. The name {{is derived from the}} Greek κερας/keras meaning 'horn' and οψις/opsis meaning 'face'. As early as the 1960s, it was noted that the name Ceratopsia is actually incorrect linguistically and that it should be Ceratopia. However, this spelling, while technically correct, has been used only rarely in the scientific literature, {{and the vast majority of}} paleontologists continue to use Ceratopsia. As the ICZN does not govern taxa above the level of superfamily, this is unlikely to change.|$|E

Plasmids encoding the Escherichia coli uidA (gus) gene {{under the control of}} CaMV 35 S, Emu, Act 1 or Ubi 1 promoters were delivered into cell suspension cultures by particle bombardment. Transient gene expression, 48 h after delivery, was greatest from plasmids utilising the constitutive promoters, Act 1 and Ubi 1. Gene expression in stably transformed tissue was examined by bombarding embryogenic Indica rice calli with a pUbil-gus plasmid and a plasmid containing either the selectable marker gene, hph, which confers hygromycin resistance, or bar, which confers resistance to the herbicide phosphinothricin (BASTA) each {{under the control of the}} CaMV 35 S, Emu, Act 1 or the Ubi 1 promoters. The bombarded calli were placed on the appropriate selection media and stained for GUS activity at 1 day, 3 weeks and 5 weeks after shooting.

Co-bombardment of calli with either the pEmu-hph or <b>pUbi</b> 1 -hph construct and a virus minor coat protein (cp) gene construct resulted in many fertile transgenic Indica rice plants, containing one to eight copies of both the hph and cp genes.

5|$|Lice {{have been}} the subject of {{significant}} DNA research in the 2000s that led to discoveries on human evolution. The three species of sucking lice that parasitize human beings belong to two genera, Pediculus and Pthirus: head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis), body lice (Pediculus humanus corporis), and pubic lice (Pthirus <b>pubis).</b> Human head and body lice (genus Pediculus) share a common ancestor with chimpanzee lice, while pubic lice (genus Pthirus) share a common ancestor with gorilla lice. Using phylogenetic and cophylogenetic analysis, Reed et al. hypothesized that Pediculus and Pthirus are sister taxa and monophyletic. In other words, the two genera descended from the same common ancestor. The age of divergence between Pediculus and its common ancestor is estimated to be 6-7 million years ago, which matches the age predicted by chimpanzee-hominid divergence. Because parasites rely on their hosts, host-parasite cospeciation events are likely.|$|E

The juvenile exhibits features different from the adult in regions like the mandible, pectoral girdle, pelvis and hindlimb, although overall their anatomy is quite similar.

5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of Brancasaurus brancai is GPMM A3.B4, stored at the University of Münster. It originates from a clay pit {{near the city}} of Gronau, North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. The specimen was discovered in July 1910 by workers in the clay pit, who dug it out using pickaxes; in doing so, they damaged the specimen (in particular, the <b>pubis</b> had been broken into 176 pieces), and left behind a number of small fragments that were later personally collected by paleontologist Theodor Wegner, who in 1928 described the specimen in detail. The skeleton is fairly complete, consisting of various parts of the skull, most of the vertebrae, several isolated ribs and gastralia, parts of the pectoral and pelvic girdles, both humeri, one femur, and various foot bones from the flippers. Over time, a number of parts have been lost, including several pieces of the skull, teeth, gastralia and caudal vertebrae, a second femur, and a radius, tibia, and fibula. A wax endocast of the brain of the type specimen is stored as SMF R4076 in the Naturmuseum Senckenberg.|$|E
5|$|The neck {{consisted}} of nine cervical vertebrae, {{which would have}} formed an S-shaped curve, {{as indicated by the}} shape of the vertebral bodies in the side view of the skeleton. The vertebral bodies of the anterior cervical vertebrae are shaped like a parallelogram, those of the middle are rectangular and those of the posterior show a trapezoid shape. The trunk was short, consisting of 12 dorsal and 6 fused sacral vertebrae. The tail was long compared to the body; although incompletely known, it probably {{consisted of}} 34 to 37 caudal vertebrae. The dorsal spine was stiffened by ossified tendons, beginning with the fourth dorsal vertebra. This feature is present in many other ornithischian dinosaurs and probably countered stress caused by bending forces acting on the spine during bipedal locomotion. In contrast to many other ornithischians, the tail of Heterodontosaurus lacked ossified tendons, and was therefore probably flexible. It had a long, narrow pelvis and a <b>pubis</b> which resembled those possessed by more advanced ornithischians.|$|E

40|$|Aspergillus is {{a widely}} used host {{organism}} for the industrial production of homologous and heterologous proteins. Although Aspergillus niger is most commonly used, a close relative of this species, Aspergillus vadensis, has been suggested as a suitable and more favourable alternative due in part, to the low levels of extracellular proteases which it produces. Despite much progress being made in the hyper production of homologous proteins, the yields obtained for heterologous proteins have still not reached a comparable level. Genetic strategies, including the development of strong constitutional promoters {{have been shown to}} lead to an increase in the levels of recombinant protein production. In this study, six novel constitutional promoters from A. niger (pef 1 α, ptktA, pef 1 β, ptal 1, pcetA and ppgkA) and a further five from A. vadensis (pef 1 α, prps 31, pgpdA, <b>pubi</b> 1 and poliC) were tested in A. vadensis using a gene encoding a secreted arabinofuranosidase from Fusarium oxysporum as a reporter for heterologous protein production.

5|$|The scapula {{was short}} with a {{moderately}} expanded upper end. The coracoid was circular in side view. The {{elements of the}} forelimb were generally moderately long, straight and stout. The hand is only known from recent discoveries and {{has not yet been}} described. In the rather wide pelvis, the ilium was straight in side view. Its front blade was rod-shaped and moderately splayed to the outside, creating room for the belly. This was reinforced by the sacral ribs becoming longer towards the front. The sacral ribs were wider at their attachment areas with the ilium, but were not fused into a sacral yoke. The <b>pubis</b> featured a short prepubis. The <b>pubis</b> shaft was straight, running parallel to a straight ischium shaft that was transversely flattened at its lower end. The thighbone was straight in side view, in front view it was somewhat bowed to the outside. Its head was not separated from the shaft by a real neck. While the major trochanter was at about the same level as the head, the lower minor trochanter was separated from both by a deep cleft. At it rear side, the femur mid-shaft featured a well-developed drooping fourth trochanter, a process for the attachment of the retractor tail muscle, the Musculus caudofemoralis longus. The lower leg was somewhat shorter than the thighbone. The tibia had a wide upper end, with a cnemial crest protruding well to the front. The tibia lower end was also robust and rotated about 70° compared to the upper part, turning the foot strongly to the outside. The foot was very large and wide. The fifth metatarsal was only rudimentary but the other four were robust. Scelidosaurus had four large toes, with the innermost digit being the smallest. The fourth metatarsal was short but its toe was long and built to be splayed to the outside of the foot, to improve the stability. The claws were flat, hoof-shaped and curved to the inside.|$|E

40|$|An {{overview}} of the estimates of consumption by predators on the main fish stocks in the Barents Sea is given. The main predators are cod (Gadus morhua), harp seal (Phoca groenlandica) and minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). The results indicate that cod {{is the most important}} predator, con-suming about as much food annually as harp seals and minke whales combined. The consumption esti-mates, together with data on the amount of fish removed by commercial fisheries, are compared to estimates of the abundance and removal through natural mortality of the various species of fish prey. The consistency between these estimates is discussed. The natural mortality values for cod and had-dock used in assessments are found to be reasonably consistent with the consumption estimates. The consumption of capelin is found to be higher than what is available for predation in years of low capelin abundance, while in years of high herring abundance the consumption of herring does not explain all the mortality. The way in which the consumption estimates are and can be utilised in the assessment and management of fish stocks in the Barents Sea using multispecies models and approaches is described.

Tetracycline resistance could not be demonstrated at pH 10. 5, but transconjugants retained resistance upon growth at pH 7. 5 after having grown for several generations at pH 10. 5. When the Bacilus subilis donor strain contained plasmids, either <b>pUBI</b> 10 or pTV 1, in addition to Tn 925, transfer of the plasmid to the alkaliphile occurred during conjugation, either together with or independently of {{the transfer of the}} transposon.

40|$|Background: Extramammary Paget’s disease (EMPD) {{remains a}} rare {{condition}} {{with only a}} limited number of cases reported in the literature. EMPD is mainly composed of intraepidermal Paget cells, and possesses variable clinical behaviors and histological appearances, leading to difficulty in the diagnosis of this disease. Case presentation: We here report a case of primary EMPD with the appearance of a nodule on the background of erythema. Histological assessment showed Paget cell infiltration throughout the epidermis with dermal spread. Using immunohistochemistry, the expressions of CK 7, CK 19, CK 20, GCDFP- 15, CEA, S- 100 protein and bcl- 2 were examined to elucidate the cellular differentiation of the carcinoma. Conclusion: According to the histological assessment, this case was diagnosed as primary EMPD with carcinoma cells invading into the dermis, but without lymph node infiltration. Background EMPD of the vulva is a rare intraepithelial adenocarcinoma which accounts for less than 1 % of carcinomas in vulva, while the majority of the patients are postmenopausal Caucasian females[1 - 3]. The cancer cells in the neoplasm usually stay “in situ ” and only rarely invade into the dermis to be metastatic via the lymphatic system [4, 5]. One has to differentiate neoplasms with Paget phenomenon from carcinomas metastasized from adjacent organs such as the urinary system and rectum [6]. Here, we present an unusual case of EMPD with carcinoma cells invading into the dermis without lymph node infiltration in a Chinese woman.
