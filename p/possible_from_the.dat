5|$|The VOC {{authorities}} salvaged {{as much as}} <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> beached Meermin. They recovered nearly 300 firearms, gunpowder and musket balls, compasses {{and five}} bayonets; they auctioned cables, ropes and other items from the ship on the shore. Meermin was left to break up where she grounded.|$|E
5|$|Cooley {{was born}} in Maryland, but little else is known about his life prior to 1813, {{when he arrived in}} East Florida, a {{province}} of Spanish Florida, as part of a military expedition. He established himself as a farmer {{in the northern part of}} the province before moving south, where he traded with local Indians and continued to farm. During the period in which the region was transferred from Spanish to U.S. governance, he sided with natives in a land dispute against a merchant who had received a large grant from the King of Spain and was evicting the Indians from their lands. Unhappy with the actions of the Spanish, he moved to the New River area in 1826 to get as far as <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Spanish influence.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the key}} aims of {{the astronomers}} who {{designed}} the Hubble Space Telescope was to use its high optical resolution to study distant galaxies {{to a level of}} detail that was not <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground. Positioned above the atmosphere, Hubble avoids atmospheric airglow allowing it to take more sensitive visible and ultraviolet light images than can be obtained with seeing-limited ground-based telescopes (when good adaptive optics correction at visible wavelengths becomes possible, 10m ground-based telescopes may become competitive). Although the telescope's mirror suffered from spherical aberration when the telescope was launched in 1990, it could still be used to take images of more distant galaxies than had previously been obtainable. Because light takes billions of years to reach Earth from very distant galaxies, we see them as they were billions of years ago; thus, extending the scope of such research to increasingly distant galaxies allows {{a better understanding of how}} they evolve.|$|E
5|$|With no aid <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shore, {{night fell}} on 14January {{with most of}} the crew and {{passengers}} still aboard. During the night, the waves stove in (smashed in) the stern of the ship, flooding much of the interior. On the morning of 15January, a small boat carrying nine British prisoners (part of the crew of the Cumberland, captured by Droits de l'Homme earlier in the campaign) managed to reach shore. The sight of the British-manned boat reaching shore prompted a mass launching of small rafts from the wreck in hopes of gaining the beach. However the waves increased once more, and not one of these small craft survived the passage.|$|E
5|$|With only 4:25 {{remaining}} and a lead well in hand, Stanford {{began running}} down the clock by executing running plays, which keep the game clock running {{as long as the}} ball carrier is downed in the field of play. Three rushes gained Stanford 16yards, but the effectiveness of this strategy was undermined by a 15-yard personal foul penalty against Stanford that prevented the Cardinal from gaining a first down. Stanford also accepted a delay of game penalty in order to squeeze as much time as <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> clock before punting back to Virginia Tech. The final drive of the game began from the Tech 11-yard line with 2:10 remaining, and quarterback Taylor controlled the ball on all of its five plays. Taylor completed a five-yard pass to Coale, then ran for 18yards and a first down. He was then sacked for a 15-yard loss, but gained much of that back with an 11-yard run. On the game's final play, Taylor completed a 17-yard first-down pass to Wilson, who was tackled as the last second ticked off the clock and Stanford clinched a 40–12 victory.|$|E

25|$|High-protein food {{increases}} the nitrogen balance, and would theoretically increase encephalopathy; in the past, this was therefore eliminated {{as much as}} <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> diet. Recent studies show that this assumption was incorrect, and high-protein foods are even encouraged to maintain adequate nutrition.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} {{also included}} {{the building of}} two signal boxes, one {{at each end of}} the station. It was possible to hear the bells in these boxes ringing from a point mid-way along the main platforms.

25|$|The most {{important}} initial issue {{when considering the}} application of anaerobic digestion systems is the feedstock to the process. Almost any organic material can be processed with anaerobic digestion; however, if biogas production is the aim, the level of putrescibility is the key factor in its successful application. The more putrescible (digestible) the material, the higher the gas yields <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> system.|$|E
25|$|For {{the time}} being, however, Helms {{had succeeded in}} {{distancing}} the CIA as far as <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> scandal. Yet Watergate became a major factor (among others: the Vietnam war) in the great shift of American public opinion about the USG: many voters turned critical, their suspicions aroused. Hence also, the political role of the Central Intelligence Agency became a subject of controversy.|$|E
25|$|Play {{was only}} <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the}} second {{scheduled}} day, and both teams made heavy weather of bowling their opponents out.

25|$|All of this careful {{settling}} of the yerba {{ensures that}} each sip contains as little particulate matter as possible, creating a smooth-running mate. The finest particles {{will then be}} as distant as <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> filtering end of the straw. With each draw, the smaller particles would inevitably move toward the straw, but the larger particles and stems filter much of this out. A sloped arrangement provides consistent concentration and flavor with each filling of the mate.|$|E
25|$|Some {{philosophers}} follow William of Ockham {{in holding}} that necessity and possibility are defined {{with respect to}} a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient. Some philosophers follow Philo of Alexandria, a philosopher known for his homocentrism, in holding that free will is a feature of a human's soul, and thus that non-human animals lack free will.|$|E
25|$|Other {{concerns}} {{included an}} NOE between U4 and U7 of the cleaved hammerhead ribozyme that {{had also been}} observed during NMR characterization, which suggested that these nucleotide bases must approach one another closer than about 6 Å, although close approach of U7 to U4 {{did not appear to}} be <b>possible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crystal structure. Finally, as previously discussed, the attacking nucleophile in the original structures, the 2’-OH of C17, was not in a position amenable to in-line attack upon the adjacent scissile phosphate.|$|E
