30|$|Existence {{results for}} vector {{equilibrium}} problems (in short, VEP) have been extensively studied in recent years. It is well-known that VEP provides a general model of several classes of <b>problems</b> such as <b>the</b> vector variational inequality, <b>the</b> vector complementarity <b>problems,</b> <b>the</b> vector optimization <b>problems,</b> <b>the</b> vector saddle point (minimax) <b>problems,</b> <b>the</b> multiobjective game <b>problems,</b> and fixed point problems (see, e.g., [2 – 9] and the references therein).|$|R

5|$|Dark Forces was ported from DOS to Apple Macintosh. This {{presented}} several {{challenges for}} the developers. LucasArts requested the game to be produced for both DOS and Macintosh with the same system requirements, specifically the random-access memory (RAM). The Mac OS runs a graphical user interface which uses up RAM while DOS does not, meaning the Macintosh version has less RAM available for Dark Forces to use. Aaron Giles, who was the Macintosh programmer for Dark Forces, explained that to resolve this <b>problem</b> <b>the</b> memory had to be managed more efficiently.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} solution strategies that Thai second graders used to solve addition and subtraction word problems. Fifty-eight children participated in this study, 40 children took a written test, and 18 children participated in an interview. In addition, two classrooms were selected for observation, and six second-grade teachers completed a questionnaire regarding their understanding of mathematical <b>problem</b> solving. <b>The</b> results indicated that Thai children in this study were successful in solving addition and subtraction word problems. For addition word <b>problems,</b> <b>the</b> compare <b>problem</b> and <b>the</b> join <b>problem</b> were <b>the</b> easiest <b>problems.</b> <b>The</b> combine <b>problem</b> was moderately difficult.
