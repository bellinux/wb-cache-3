25|$|Head & Shoulders is an American {{brand of}} anti-dandruff and non-dandruff shampoo {{produced}} by parent company Procter & Gamble that {{was introduced in}} 1961. The active ingredient is <b>pyrithione</b> <b>zinc.</b>|$|E
25|$|Zinc pyrithione (or <b>pyrithione</b> <b>zinc)</b> is a {{coordination}} {{complex of}} zinc. It has fungistatic (that is, it inhibits {{the division of}} fungal cells) and bacteriostatic (inhibits bacterial cell division) properties and {{is used in the}} treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, several {{compounds}} (antifungals, fungicides, and biocides) where {{shown to}} effectively inhibit {{the growth of}} P.destructans including benzalkonium chloride, chloroacetoxyquinoline, chloroxine, ciclopirox olamine, econazole, phenylmercuric acetate, <b>pyrithione</b> <b>zinc</b> and sulconazole. The same study showed that P.destructans was sensitive to Amphotericin B, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole, while the fungus had some resistance to anidulafungin, caspofungin, flucytosine and micafungin. A recent study (2014) identified several volatile organic compounds (benzaldehyde, benzothiazole, decanal, nonanal, N,N-dimethyloctylamine, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol) that were previously identified from fungistatic soils, which demonstrated inhibition of both mycelial extension and growth from conidia.|$|E
50|$|Like {{selenium}} sulfide, <b>zinc</b> <b>pyrithione</b> (a <b>zinc</b> complex {{with two}} chelating pyrithione anions) also reduces epidermal turnover and inhibits fungal growth. It is often administered with ketoconazole for better results. The symptoms do not resolve completely even after prolonged medication.|$|R
40|$|AbstractShampoo-induced {{allergic}} {{contact dermatitis}} is difficult to diagnose clinically because it can involve multiple and variable areas where the shampoo flows. <b>Zinc</b> <b>pyrithione</b> is a common active agent in medicated shampoo that {{is known to have}} good anti-dandruff and antifungal effects.

40|$|Synopsis [...] <b>ZINC</b> <b>PYRITHIONE,</b> also kn,own as zinc pyridine- 2 -thiol-l-oxide, {{has been}} es-tablished as an {{effective}} ANTISEBORRHEIC AGENT. Because of its limited aqueous solubility it is currently being marketed as a suspension in hair-cleansing and hair-grooming preparations. A method has been developed in which clear, aqueous (as well as nonaqueous) products can be prepared. The method {{is based upon the}} COMPLEXATION of <b>zinc</b> <b>pyrithione</b> with certain ORGANIC AMINES. It appears that <b>zinc</b> <b>pyrithione</b> is highly soluble in many primary aliphatic amines. In other more complex amines, such as the poly-alkylenimines, a definite stable molecular complex is formed. The ability of such amines to complex and produce a soluble form of <b>zinc</b> <b>pyrithione</b> is discussed with respect to the physical and d•emical properties of the ensuing solutions. Based on these findings, CLEAR HAIR Pi•EPARATIONS containing <b>zinc</b> <b>pyrithione</b> can be prepared for use as antidandruff cleansers, rinses, grooming agents, and conditioners. Ex-amples are offered of product formulations having levels of <b>zinc</b> <b>pyrithione</b> ranging from 700 to 20, 000 ppm (2 %). Analytical data concerning complex formation as well as the complexes' toxicology are presented...|$|R

40|$|A highly active {{antidandruff}} agent, <b>zinc</b> <b>pyrithione</b> {{was investigated}} on human skin cells (JTC- 17) {{to test the}} hypothesis that like selenium sulfide, it may also have an antimetabolic action on epidermis, acting on dandruff by reducing increased epidermal turnover. It has been found from the uptake of 3 H-thymidine into cells that <b>zinc</b> <b>pyrithione</b> added at levels of 0. 25 - 1. 0 /xg/ml is effective in suppressing reversibly the DNA synthesis of human skin cells in vitro without a comparable inhibitory effect on RNA and protein synthesis, asshown by the respective uptakes of 3 H-uridine and 3 H-leucine. Its homologues, sodium pyrithione and omadine disulfide, at levels of 0. 25 - 1. 0 /xg/ml also exhibit a similar eversible inhibition of DNA synthesis. On long term culture of human skin cells 15 - 27 % growth inhibition was observed with 0. 2 /xg/ml of <b>zinc</b> <b>pyrithione.</b> Analysis using synchronized cells revealed that <b>zinc</b> <b>pyrithione</b> can act on all periods of DNA synthesis to suppress it.

50|$|The {{infection}} cannot {{easily be}} removed mechanically, although further proliferation of infection {{can be achieved}} by avoidance of moisture. Removal generally involves cutting or shaving of the hair, but chemical treatments may be similarly useful. For women some individuals use a fine comb to remove as much of the infection as possible and then they cut or shave their hair. This is then followed by the application of a sublimate solution in 60% alcohol solution to the scalp. Historical treatments have used alcoholic tinctures of heavy metals, such as mercury bichloride. The application of antifungal shampoos such as <b>pyrithione</b> <b>zinc,</b> formaldehyde and salicylic acid is effective against black piedra. Oral therapy with itraconazole or terbinafine also causes nodules to break down over time. Removal of affected hair and treatment with topical agents is also effective and results in very low recurrences rates. However, {{even in the absence of}} treatment, spontaneous remission may occur.|$|E

40|$|Dandruff is {{a chronic}} {{condition}} of the scalp requiring vigilant treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of scaling and itching. Frequent shampooing is key to controlling these symptoms while contributing to the cosmetic appearance of the hair. The success of the treatment depends {{not only on the}} ability of the shampoo to control the dandruff but also on patient compliance engendered by the cosmetic attributes of the shampoo. This double-blind cross-over study enrolled 40 women with mild to moderate dandruff. Following a 1 -wk washout with an unmedicated basic cleansing shampoo, all subjects used each of the two study shampoos for 1 wk. Subjects preferred the 1 % <b>pyrithione</b> <b>zinc</b> conditioning shampoo over the 2 % ketoconazole shampoo by 75 % in terms of overall performance. The dermatologist investigator confirmed the subject preference by noting that hair-combing ease, hair smoothness, and hair frizz/flyaway were statistically significantly better in subjects who used the 1 % <b>pyrithione</b> <b>zinc</b> conditioning shampoo for 1 wk.

40|$|Application of new {{molecular}} and biochemical tools {{has greatly}} increased {{our understanding of}} the organisms, mechanisms, and treatments of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. Dandruff results from at least three etiologic factors: Malassezia fungi, sebaceous secretions, and individual sensitivity. While Malassezia (formerly P. ovale) has long been a suspected cause, implicated by its presence on skin and lipophylic nature, lack of correlation between Malassezia number and the presence and severity of dandruff has remained perplexing. We have previously identified the Malassezia species correlating to dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. In this report, we show that dandruff is mediated by Malassezia metabolites, specifically irritating free fatty acids released from sebaceous triglycerides. Investigation of the toxic Malassezia free fatty acid metabolites (represented by oleic acid) reveals the component of individual susceptibility. Malassezia metabolism results in increased levels of scalp free fatty acids. Of the three etiologic factors implicated in dandruff, Malassezia, sebaceous triglycerides, and individual susceptibility, Malassezia are the easiest to control. <b>Pyrithione</b> <b>zinc</b> kills Malassezia and all other fungi, and is highly effective against the Malassezia species actually found on scalp. Reduction in fungi reduces free fatty acids, thereby reducing scalp flaking and itch...|$|E
40|$|Pyrithione is {{a general}} {{inhibitor}} of membrane transport in fungi and is widely used in antidandruff shampoos as an antifungal agent. An electrophysiological approach {{has been used to}} determine the mode of action of pyrithione on the plasma membrane of the model ascomycete, Neurospora crassa. At pH 5. 8, pyrithione induces a dramatic dose-dependent electrical depolarization of the membrane which is complete within 4 min, amounts to 110 mV at saturating pyrithione concentrations, and is half maximal between 0. 6 and 0. 8 mM <b>pyrithione.</b> <b>Zinc</b> pyrithione induces a similar response but exerts a half-maximal effect at around 0. 3 mM. The depolarization is strongly dependent on external pH, being almost absent at pH 8. 2, at which the concentration of the uncharged form of pyrithione [...] which might be expected to permeate the membrane freely [...] is markedly lowered. However, quantitative considerations based on cytosolic buffer capacity, the pKa of pyrithione, and the submillimolar concentration at which it is active appear to preclude significant cytosolic acidification on dissociation of the thiol proton from the uncharged form of pyrithione. Current-voltage analysis demonstrates that the depolarization is accompanied by a decrease in membrane electrical conductance {{in a manner consistent with}} inhibition of the primary proton pump and inconsistent with a mode of action of pyrithione on plasma membrane ion channels. We conclude that pyrithione inhibits membrane transport via a direct or indirect effect on the primary proton pump which energizes transport and that the site of action of pyrithione is likely to be intra- rather than extracellular...|$|E

50|$|Zinc {{is popular}} in {{manufacturing}} and building; {{its ability to}} create corrosion-resistant zinc plating of steel (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in batteries and alloys, such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), <b>zinc</b> <b>pyrithione</b> (anti-dandruff shampoos), <b>zinc</b> sulfide (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.|$|R
40|$|Currently diverse {{biocidal}} agents can be {{used for}} distinct applications, such as personal hygiene, disinfection, antiparasitic activity, and antifouling effects. <b>Zinc</b> <b>pyrithione</b> is an organometallic biocide, with bactericidal, algicidal and fungicidal activities. It has been recently incorporated in antifouling formulas, such as paints, which prevent the establishment of a biofilm on surfaces exposed to the aquatic environment. It has also been used in cosmetics, such as anti-dandruff shampoos and soaps. Previously reported data has shown the presence of this substance in the aquatic compartment, a factor contributing to the potential exertion of toxic effects, and there is also evidence that photodegradation products of <b>zinc</b> <b>pyrithione</b> were involved in neurotoxic effects, namely by inhibiting cholinesterases in fish species. Additional evidence points to the involvement of <b>zinc</b> <b>pyrithione</b> in alterations of metal homeostasis and oxidative stress, in both aquatic organisms and human cell models. The present work assesses the potential ecotoxicity elicited by <b>zinc</b> <b>pyrithione</b> in the freshwater fish Gambusia holbrooki after an acute (96 h) exposure. The oxidative stress was assessed by the quantification of the activities of specific enzymes from the antioxidant defense system, such as catalase, and glutathione- S-transferases; and the extent of peroxidative damage was quantified by measuring the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels.
