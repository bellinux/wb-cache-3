5|$|The Maryland–Virginia {{football}} rivalry was {{a designated}} official ACC cross-divisional series when Maryland was an ACC member and the teams have a long-standing rivalry due to proximity and history. The <b>programs</b> <b>also</b> vie for recruits {{in the same}} region, and more recently, an additional factor has been the schools' academic competition. Maryland and Virginia have occasionally served as spoilers for one another by precluding a championship or bowl game appearance. Since Maryland is {{moving out of the}} ACC and into the Big Ten, the future of this series is in question. On January 12th, 2017, the schools jointly announced a home-home series would be played during the 2023 and 2024 seasons.|$|E
