5|$|Banknote: <b>Paper</b> <b>currency</b> {{was first}} {{developed}} in China. Its roots were in merchant receipts of deposit during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), as merchants and wholesalers desired {{to avoid the}} heavy bulk of copper coinage in large commercial transactions. During the Song Dynasty (960–1279), the central government adopted this system for their monopolized salt industry, but a gradual reduction in copper production—due to closed mines and an enormous outflow of Song-minted copper currency into the Japanese, Southeast Asian, Western Xia and Liao Dynasty economies—encouraged the Song government in the early 12th century to issue government-printed <b>paper</b> <b>currency</b> alongside copper to ease the demand on their state mints and debase the value of copper. In the early 11th century, the Song Dynasty government authorised sixteen private banks to issue notes of exchange in Sichuan, but in 1023 the government commandeered this enterprise and set up an agency to supervise the manufacture of banknotes there. The earliest <b>paper</b> <b>currency</b> was limited to certain regions {{and could not be}} used outside specified bounds, but once paper was securely backed by gold and silver stores, the Song Dynasty government initiated a nationwide <b>paper</b> <b>currency,</b> between 1265 and 1274. The concurrent Jin Dynasty (1115–1234) also printed paper banknotes by at least 1214.|$|E

5|$|The British {{government}} was also slow {{in responding to}} requests for compensation. While waiting for a response, {{the question of how}} to use any compensation was debated in provincial newspapers and pamphlets. Some, such as Samuel Adams (father of the famous American Revolution leader), advocated placing the money in London banks to serve as backing for the <b>paper</b> <b>currency</b> issued by the colonies. Others, including William Douglass and Thomas Hutchinson, speaker of the General Court, favoured using the compensation to redeem the <b>paper</b> <b>currency</b> and give Massachusetts a hard currency. In 1748 the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle returned Louibourg to France, with Massachusetts still awaiting compensation for its seizure.|$|E

5|$|The {{skirmish}} {{itself had}} no notable effect on {{relations between the}} people and the occupying Americans, which were already deteriorating as the siege dragged on. This was {{due in part to the}} fact that the Americans, rather than paying for their supplies in coin, paid with Continental <b>paper</b> <b>currency</b> or promissory notes, deemed to be of little worth by the locals.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the {{sluggish}} response of Brazil, infuriated by the {{mockery of the}} Buenos Aires press and impatient at Argentina's refusal to permit him to invade a further Brazilian province through sovereign Argentine territory, on 13 April 1865 López fired upon and seized two small Argentine naval vessels moored in the port of Corrientes, then proceeded to take the Argentine province of that name, making Paraguayan <b>paper</b> <b>currency</b> compulsory on pain of death. The resulting War of the Triple Alliance was to destroy his country.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War economy catalyzed a {{shortage}} of United States coinage—gold and silver coins were hoarded given their intrinsic bullion value relative to irredeemable <b>paper</b> <b>currency</b> at the time. In late 1861, to help finance the Civil War, the U.S. government borrowed gold coin from New York City banks in exchange for Seven-thirties treasury notes and the New York banks sold them {{to the public for}} gold to repay the loan. In December 1861, the Trent Affair shook public confidence with the threat of war on a second front. The United States Department of the Treasury suspended specie payments and banks in New York City stopped redeeming paper money for gold and silver. In the absence of gold and silver coin, the premium for specie began to devalue <b>paper</b> <b>currency.</b> After the New York banks suspended specie payments (quickly followed by Boston and Philadelphia) the premium on gold rose from 1–3% over paper in early January 1862 to 9% over paper in June 1862, by which time one paper dollar was worth 91.69 cents in gold. This fueled currency speculation (e.g., redeeming banknotes for silver coin which was then sold at a premium as bullion), and created significant disruption across businesses and trade. Alternate methods of providing small change included the reintroduction of Spanish quarter dollars in Philadelphia, cutting dollar bills in quarters or halves, refusing to provide change (without charging a premium for providing silver coins), or the issuance of locally issued shinplasters (i.e., those issued by businesses or local municipalities) was forbidden by law in many states.|$|E
50|$|This was {{supplemented}} by occasional local issues of <b>paper</b> <b>currencies.</b> One coin, a copper halfpenny, was also struck specifically {{for use in}} the islands in 1821, which intermingled with British coinage. The notes were denominated in pounds and shillings and valued to the British pound at par.|$|R

50|$|A private {{currency}} is a {{currency is}}sued {{by a private}} entity, be it an individual, a commercial business or a nonprofit enterprise.

5|$|The coins met {{a hostile}} {{reception}} {{from the business}} community in Honolulu, who feared inflation of the currency {{in a time of}} recession. After legal maneuvering, the government agreed to use over half of the coinage as backing for <b>paper</b> <b>currency,</b> and this continued until better economic times began in 1885. After that, the coins were more eagerly accepted in circulation. They remained in the flow of commerce on the islands until withdrawn in 1903, after Hawaii had become a US territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{inaugural address}} was a {{detailed}} {{statement of the}} Whig agenda, essentially a repudiation of Jackson and Van Buren's policies. Harrison promised to reestablish the Bank of the United States and extend its capacity for credit by issuing <b>paper</b> <b>currency</b> (Henry Clay's American system); to defer to the judgment of Congress on legislative matters, with sparing use of his veto power; and to reverse Jackson's spoils system of executive patronage. He promised to use patronage to create a qualified staff, not to enhance his own standing in government.|$|E
5|$|The silver half dime, {{equal to}} five cents, had been issued since the 1790s. The American Civil War caused {{economic}} hardship, driving {{gold and silver}} from circulation; in response, in place of low-value coins, the government at first issued <b>paper</b> <b>currency.</b> In 1865, Congress abolished the five-cent fractional currency note after Spencer M. Clark, head of the Currency Bureau (today the Bureau of Engraving and Printing), placed his own portrait on the denomination. After the successful introduction of two-cent and three-cent pieces without precious metal, Congress also authorized a five-cent piece consisting of base metal; the Mint began striking this version in 1866.|$|E

50|$|Even {{more so than}} hyper{{inflation}}, chronic {{inflation is}} a twentieth-century phenomenon, being first observed by Felipe Pazos in 1972. High inflation can only be sustained with unbacked <b>paper</b> <b>currencies</b> over long periods, and before World War II unbacked <b>paper</b> <b>currencies</b> were rare except in countries affected by war - which often produced extremely high inflation but never {{for more than a}} few years. Most economists believe chronic inflation first emerged in Latin America following World War II, with the result that it was originally called “Latin inflation”. Some economists, however, argue that the experience of France in the 1920s was the first case of chronic inflation. Japan (see below) in the years surrounding World War II is another case with characteristics very akin to well-studied cases of chronic inflation.|$|R
50|$|Save our Swiss Gold {{motion is}} a citizen {{movement}} {{that calls for}} the Swiss central bank to hold at least 20% of its assets in gold, prohibit selling any gold in future and bring back all its gold reserves to Switzerland.The Swiss government and the Swiss National Bank (SNB), however, {{do not agree with}} this citizen movement and stepped up efforts to block the motion that would force the country to almost triple the amount of its gold reserves.The group argue that gold is a barrier to devaluation of fiat <b>paper</b> <b>currencies</b> {{and that there is a}} key flaw in the system of floating <b>paper</b> <b>currencies.</b> When a currency moves, it creates winners and losers, big movements can harm banks with loan portfolios outside abroad. The group argues that gold is a barrier to debasement of fiat currencies.|$|R
5|$|Following the California {{gold rush}} {{that began in}} 1849 and the Australian gold rush that began in 1851, a larger amount of gold was put into {{commerce}} than could be easily absorbed by the normal channels. This resulted in {{a decrease in the}} value of gold and an increase in the relative value of silver. As a result, silver coins rapidly disappeared from circulation due either to hoarding or melting. In response, Congress authorized the Mint to reduce the quantity of silver in all denominations except the three-cent piece and silver dollar. Beginning in the 1860s, silver production rose and the price decreased. During this time, silver coins largely disappeared from circulation and were replaced by copper and <b>paper</b> <b>currency.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1874, trade dollars began {{appearing}} in American commerce. In early 1875, Congress passed the Specie Redemption Act, allowing the Treasury {{to pay out}} silver coins in exchange for <b>paper</b> <b>currency.</b> That act, combined with {{a drop in the}} price of silver, caused hoarded or exported silver coins to reappear in commerce within the United States. Many trade dollars were reimported, especially to California. After the value of silver began to decline and the intrinsic value of the coins fell below one dollar, bullion depositors began having their silver struck as trade dollars and selling them wholesale to be distributed throughout the country. Bullion producers opted to coin their silver into trade dollars because the Coinage Act of 1873 specified that silver brought to the Mint could only be struck as such or cast into bars.|$|E
5|$|The Bland–Allison Act, {{passed by}} Congress on February 28, 1878, {{required}} the Treasury {{to purchase a}} minimum of $2million in domestically mined silver per month and coin it into silver dollars. The Mint used a new design by engraver George T. Morgan, and struck {{what became known as}} the Morgan dollar. Many of the pieces quickly vanished into bank vaults for use as backing for <b>paper</b> <b>currency</b> redeemable in silver coin, known as silver certificates. In 1890, the purchases required under the Bland–Allison Act were greatly increased under the terms of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Although the Sherman Act was repealed in 1893, it was not until 1904 that the government struck the last of the purchased silver into dollars. Once it did, production of the coin ceased.|$|E

5|$|The French and American armies {{marched through}} Philadelphia from September 2 to the 4th, where the American {{soldiers}} announced {{they would not}} leave Maryland until they received one month's pay in coin, {{rather than in the}} worthless Continental <b>paper</b> <b>currency.</b> General Rochambeau generously loaned Washington half of his supply of gold Spanish coins. This would be the last time the men would be paid. It significantly strengthened French and American relations On September 5, Washington learned of the arrival of de Grasse's fleet off the Virginia Capes.

5|$|Washington's army of 11,000 {{went into}} winter {{quarters}} at Valley Forge north of Philadelphia in December 1777. Over {{the next six}} months, the deaths in camp numbered in the thousands, the majority being from disease, compounded by lack of food and proper clothing, poor shelter, and the extreme cold. Historians' death toll estimates range from 2,000 to over 3,000 men. The British were comfortably quartered in Philadelphia and paid for their supplies in sterling. In contrast, Washington had difficulty procuring supplies from the few farmers in the area who would not accept rapidly depreciating American <b>paper</b> <b>currency,</b> while the woodlands about the valley had soon been exhausted of game. As conditions worsened, Washington was faced {{with the task of}} maintaining morale and discouraging desertion, which had become common by February.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, the German {{government}} {{hoped to}} destabilize British rule over India by spreading {{rumors that the}} British were unable to redeem for silver all of the <b>paper</b> <b>currency</b> they had printed. These rumors, and hoarding of silver, caused the price of silver to rise and risked damaging the British war effort. The British turned to their war ally, the United States, asking to purchase silver to increase the supply and lower the price. In response, Congress passed the Pittman Act of April 23, 1918. This statute gave the United States authority to sell metal to the British government from up to 350,000,000 silver dollars at $1 per ounce of silver plus {{the value of the}} copper in the coins, and handling and transportation fees. Only 270,232,722 coins were melted for sale to the British, but this represented 47% of all Morgan dollars struck to that point. The Treasury was required by the terms of the Act to strike new silver dollars to replace the coins that were melted, and to strike them from silver purchased from American mining companies.|$|E

50|$|The <b>paper</b> <b>currencies</b> of some {{developed}} countries have earned recognition as hard currencies at various times, including the United States dollar, Euro, Swiss franc, British pound sterling, Japanese yen, {{and to a}} lesser extent, the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1850s, {{there was much}} {{economic}} prosperity in the United States, to a major extent stimulated by {{the large amount of}} gold discovered and mined in the California Gold Rush, which greatly expanded the money supply.

Eastern banks became cautious with their loans to the west and some even refused to accept western bank-issued <b>paper</b> <b>currencies.</b>|$|R
5|$|The central {{government}} soon observed the economic advantages of printing paper money, issuing a monopoly right {{of several of}} the deposit shops to the issuance of these certificates of deposit. By the early 12th century, the amount of banknotes issued in a single year amounted to an annual rate of 26million strings of cash coins. By the 1120s the {{central government}} officially stepped in and produced their own state-issued paper money (using woodblock printing). Even before this point, the Song government was amassing large amounts of paper tribute. It was recorded that each year before 1101 AD, the prefecture of Xinan (modern Xi-xian, Anhui) alone would send 1,500,000 sheets of paper in seven different varieties to the capital at Kaifeng. In that year of 1101, the Emperor Huizong of Song decided to lessen the amount of paper taken in the tribute quota, because it was causing detrimental effects and creating heavy burdens on the people of the region. However, the government still needed masses of paper product for the exchange certificates and the state's new issuing of paper money. For the printing of paper money alone, the Song court established several government-run factories in the cities of Huizhou, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Anqi. The size of the workforce employed in these paper money factories were quite large, as it was recorded in 1175 AD that the factory at Hangzhou alone employed more than a thousand workers a day. However, the government issues of paper money were not yet nationwide standards of currency at that point; issues of banknotes were limited to regional zones of the empire, and were valid for use only in a designated and temporary limit of 3-year's time. The geographic limitation changed between the years 1265 and 1274, when the late Southern Song government finally produced a nationwide standard currency of paper money, once its widespread circulation was backed by gold or silver. The range of varying values for these banknotes was perhaps from one string of cash to one hundred at the most. In later dynasties, the use and enforcement of <b>paper</b> <b>currency</b> was a method undertaken by the government {{as a response to the}} counterfeiting of copper coins.|$|E
