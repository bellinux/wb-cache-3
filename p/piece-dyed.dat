500|$|Textiles may be dyed as raw fibre (dyed in the fleece or dyed in the wool), as {{spun yarn}} (dyed in the hank or yarn-dyed), or after weaving (<b>piece-dyed).</b> [...] Mordants often leave residue in wool fibre {{that makes it}} {{difficult}} to spin, so wool was generally dyed after spinning, as yarn or woven cloth. Indigo, however, requires no mordant, and cloth manufacturers in medieval England often dyed wool in the fleece with the indigo-bearing plant woad and then dyed the cloth again after weaving to produce deep blues, browns, reds, purples, blacks, and tawnies.|$|E
500|$|When kermes-dyed {{textiles}} achieved prominence {{around the}} mid-11th century, the dyestuff was called [...] "grain" [...] in all Western European languages because the desiccated eggs resemble fine grains of wheat or sand. [...] Textiles dyed with kermes {{were described as}} dyed in the grain. Woollens were frequently dyed in the fleece with woad and then <b>piece-dyed</b> in kermes, producing a wide range colors from blacks and grays through browns, murreys, purples, and sanguines.
