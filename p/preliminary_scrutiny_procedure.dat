40|$|Temporal lobe {{epilepsy}} with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS) {{is one of}} {{the more}} common forms of chronic epilepsy. Its aetiology is unknown, though an early developmental insult is thought by some to be an important trigger. There is not a strong genetic predisposition; gene-environment interactions are more significant considerations. Environmental risk factors for TLE-HS are under-researched. Domoic acid (DA) is an environmental neurotoxin of algal origin that can contaminate marine food webs. DA can cross the placenta, is significantly more toxic to the developing brain compared to the adult brain, and has affected humans and marine wildlife through mass poisonings. DA coincidentally has a decades-long history of use as a chemical model of temporal lobe epilepsy, along with its close structural analogue kainic acid (also of algal origin). The principal hypothesis presented here is that dietary exposure to doses of DA that are sub-clinical in pregnant women may be sufficient to damage the foetal hippocampus and initiate epileptogenesis. The hypothesis could be tested both experimentally by in vivo proof-of-concept animal studies that expand on current knowledge of prenatal susceptibility to DA neurotoxicity, and by epidemiological investigations directed towards dietary exposure to marine food products. If only a small proportion of the attributable risk for TLE-HS is found to be due to gestational exposure to DA, the public health implications would still be of great significance, as this would represent a potentially preventable exposure. Other potent neurotoxins are produced by marine microalgae and freshwater cyanobacteria. These structurally and mechanistically diverse toxins can also contaminate water supplies, seafood and shellfish. Several operate by modulating ion channels, so may also be of interest to epilepsy researchers.

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a case study}} of the scope of subsidiarity review exercised by the Swedish Riksdag within the Early Warning Mechanism (EWM). It takes its starting point in the theoretical debate on the scope of subsidiarity review reaching the conclusion that the Swedish case confirms both Kiiver’s definition of the scope of the review to include legality and proportionality, and Jancic’s more recent article arguing for a broader review to include substance besides the principle of legality and proportionality. The connection between issues concerning the scope of the review within the EWM and several of the arguments in favour of a reform of the EWM is that national parliaments are not apt to make legal assessments such as a strictly legal approach to the review would suggest. In light of this, the Swedish case is interesting taking into account that the Committee on the Constitution has the task to provide a yearly analysis of the review exercised by sectoral committees, including questions related to method and the outcome of the review on the EU-legislative process. The {{article provides}} a critical assessment {{of the role of the}} Committee on the Constitution within the Swedish <b>scrutiny</b> <b>procedure,</b> reaching the conclusion that the Committee’s evaluation suffers several methodological weaknesses; weaknesses that do effect the impact and efficiency of the Swedish scrutiny process. The Swedish model for scrutiny of subsidiarity within the EWM combines a fully decentralised review by sectoral committees with the yearly ‘helicopter perspective’ offered by the Committee on the Constitution. The primary task of the Committee on the Constitution is to act as protector of decentralisation by identifying creeping competence overstretches. Taken together this could be a strong model of scrutiny within the EWM should the Committee on the Constitution, or whatever body is entrusted with the overall analysis, take is task to provide methodological guidance seriously.

40|$|Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Uruguay {{undertook}} extensive trade reform {{at a time}} of crisis, {{at which}} time institutional reform was difficult to undertake. Many of the countries had become members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in the late 1980 s and anticipated institutional reform. Only later did they reform trade policymaking institutions to bring them somewhat in line with trade policy regimes and GATT rules. These countries have all used reference prices and antidumping provisions of GATT, rather than safeguards, to provide relief from import surges. They have all tried to centralize trade policy by moving it from different agencies into a single agency. Despite liberalization, some sectors [...] including automobiles, textiles and agriculture [...] remain protected. Lessons the author draws from experience in these coutries: 1) the deteriorating macroeconomic situations are the main challenge to maintaining open trade policy; 2) trade policymaking must be constantly reviewed to prevent reversals, and the costs of protection must be communicated to the public at large; 3) There must be short-run measures to help domestic activities adjust to short-run price movements and alleviate pressure for protection. The danger [...] such measures (unrelated to long-run price trends) can become permanent. 4) external commitments (through WTO or customs unions) can be used to discourage a return to protection; 5) extending reform (to labor and capital markets and the regulatory framework) will help maintain and extend trade liberalization. Allowing factors of production to move smoothly from one activity to another could help prevent the buildup of pressures that lead to protection; 6) an institution to consider exceptional protection should be advisory (independent of day-to-day trade policymaking), so that it works steadily, free from administrative pressures and exigencies. Requests for protection must be handled openly and transparently, with the findings subject to public <b>scrutiny.</b> <b>Procedures</b> for granting relief through safeguards and similar mechanisms must reflect all interests, including those of consumers, exporters, and users of the product; and 7) the analysis to establish injury must conform to high technical standards. The criteria to consider trade policies must reflect national interests, not those of any particular sector.

40|$|Privacy and verifiability {{refer to}} {{fundamental}} principles of democratic elections and therefore {{belong to the}} set of established security requirements which each electronic voting scheme is expected to meet. However, very different ideas and opinions about privacy and verifiability exist in the scientific community, which shows that both properties are not well understood yet. Moreover, although the desired properties (captured by the security requirements) should {{be separated from the}} assumed adversary model (expressed by adversary capabilities), specific adversary capabilities are inherently assumed for the privacy-related security requirements of receipt-freeness and coercion-resistance, which complicates the analysis of voting schemes. The first part of this thesis presents a taxonomy for privacy and verifiability in electronic voting. We compile the conceivable levels of privacy and verifiability and investigate the relation between both properties. To this end, we introduce a conceptual model capturing both privacy and verifiability. We also provide a comprehensive adversary model for electronic voting by considering different adversary capabilities. The conceptual model, the levels of privacy and verifiability, and the adversary capabilities together form our taxonomy for privacy and verifiability in electronic voting. The presented taxonomy provides a deeper understanding of privacy and verifiability and their correlation in electronic voting. We show how the taxonomy can be used to analyze the security of voting schemes by identifying the level of privacy and verifiability provided depending on the adversary capabilities assumed. Moreover, the taxonomy allows to select appropriate levels of the requirements for different types of elections, and to determine reasonable adversary models for individual election scenarios. The second part of this thesis considers long-term aspects of verifiability in remote electronic voting. The lawfulness of any legally binding election must be provable for several years due to possible scrutiny proceedings. Therefore, specific documents such as the ballots must be retained. The election records are usually retained for the legislative period of the elected body; however, this period may be extended if <b>scrutiny</b> <b>procedures</b> are pending. Retention obligations apply not only to conventional paper-based elections, but also to remote electronic voting. But contrary to the case of paper-based elections, general regulations or guidelines on retention of remote electronic election data have not been issued so far. In particular, the question which records should be retained is yet unanswered. The second part of this thesis sets out to identify the election records that have to be retained in order to prove the proper conduct of a remote electronic election. We derive retention requirements for online elections from legal regulations which apply to Federal Elections for the German Bundestag, and we make recommendations on how to meet these requirements. Establishing Internet voting in parliamentary elections presupposes that its technical implementation meets certain legal requirements, and conclusive retention of election data is one of them. Thus, our work contributes to establishing online voting as an additional voting channel in parliamentary elections in Germany. It may support legislative organs when issuing a legal framework on remote electronic voting. Moreover, our work is valuable for developing legally compliant voting systems as the need for record keeping should be considered already when designing and implementing a remote electronic voting scheme...|$|R

Focusing on the dissonance between basic freedoms guaranteed by the United States Constitution and the security policies implemented by the federal government, this Note argues that the disparity in scrutiny received by minority travelers is counterproductive because it reinforces racism and ethnocentrism as social norms and fails to ensure a consistent level of protection for all passengers.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{experience}} of dementia as recounted by family carers and people with the early experience of dementia. Between October, 1992 and May, 1996 sixty four semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} family carers of people with dementia using a modified grounded theory approach. Constant comparative analysis of the data led to the emergence of a five stage integrated scheme to explain their experiences, namely: Recognising the Need (1); Taking it On (2); Working Through It (3); Reaching the End (4); and A New Beginning (5), with critical junctures attached to each stage which either locked the carer in, or moved the carer through, the model. A second phase of data collection comprised eleven interviews with ten people with the early experience of dementia and their family carers. Analysis of these data resulted in the emergence of the stage of Keeping it Hidden with its supporting strategies: Closing Down; Regrouping; and Covering your Tracks which help to explain how people with early dementia manage their changing cognitive abilities. Following a theoretical integration of the two phases of data collection the process of 'working' emerged in three forms, i. e. Working Apart; Working Together; and Working Alone to explain movement between the above two models. Transcending the data, the study also generated the linking scheme of Maintaining Involvement to help explain the dynamics of dementia. The 'fit and grab' of this linking scheme was subjected to <b>preliminary</b> empirical <b>scrutiny</b> via a third series of interviews with six carers of people with dementia. It is suggested that the grounded theory emerging from this study helps to explain the shared experience of dementia, while also having implications for policy and practice which are briefly explored in the concluding chapter, together with some of the methodological implications and limitations of the study...|$|R
40|$|Art deaccessions prompt {{lawsuits}} against museums, and some commentators advocate using the stricter trust standard of care, {{instead of the}} prevailing corporate standard (business judgment rule), to evaluate the conduct of non‑profit museum boards. This Article explores the consequences of adopting the trust standard by applying it to previously unavailable deaccession policies of prominent art museums. It finds that so long as museum boards adhere to these policies, their decisions would satisfy the trust standard. This outcome illustrates an important limitation of fiduciary law: the trust standard evaluates procedural care but cannot assess deaccessions on their merits. Yet this limitation, far from undercutting the trust rule, balances judicial review with protecting boards’ management discretion. This Article ventures beyond formalist analysis of fiduciary duty and examines the non‑legal, substantive rules governing art deaccessions. It argues that complemented by non‑legal rules, the trust standard provides the best framework for adjudicating deaccession lawsuits because it ensures judicial <b>scrutiny</b> of deaccession <b>procedures</b> while leaving appraisal of deaccessions’ merits to museum professionals and the public they serve.

Micklitz (EUI), John Paterson (External Co-Supervisor, University of Aberdeen), David M. Trubek (University of Wisconsin, Madison) This {{thesis is}} devoted to {{analysing}} the emerging relationship in the European Union between 'new governance' - epitomised {{by the development of}} the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) - and law. While some scholars have seen the project of new governance as a purely political or functional enterprise - a mechanism of 'soft law' - the thesis will argue against such a view through an empirical analysis of a particular OMC process - the OMC for social inclusion and social protection (the OMC SPSI). While on the one hand, the OMC SPSI has achieved considerable success in creating a new social policy vocabulary in Europe, the very description of the OMC as an instrument of 'soft law' has handed considerable power to frame key policy decisions to national and European executives, while depriving Parliaments and local authorities from their normal rights of scrutiny. The OMC SPSI illustrates why - far from invoking a merely 'technical' or procedural set of questions - 'new governance' is deeply implicated in debates over the future of the European welfare state. The indicators and recommendations of the method are not seen by its participants as neutral descriptors, but rather invoke competing views of the very ends of social policy in Europe. The description of new governance as soft and heterarhical does not therefore dilute its key legitimacy challenges, but makes them ever more pressing. In response, the thesis will argue for a 'constitutionalisation' of new governance. This constitutionalisation, the thesis will argue, should not be aimed at a legal 'juridification' of OMC procedures, or at re-enforcing their participatory potential, but rather at creating opportunities for political contestation and <b>scrutiny</b> in <b>procedures</b> too long the preserve of a small and mutually re-enforcing circle of executive actors. A 'republican' constitutionalisation of the OMC - one able to politicise the norms and indicators through which national social policy is being evaluated - may allow 'new governance' a last opportunity to refute accusations of executive dominance and technocratic paternalism that threaten to undermine its 'procedural' potential...|$|R
40|$|This paper while {{agreeing with}} the general thrust of the Narasimham Committee Report. Calls {{attention}} to some logical corollaries of the Report and analyses some possible fallout from implementing the Report. We agree with the view that control of banking system should be under an autonomous body supervised by the RBI. However {{at the level of}} individual banks, closer <b>scrutiny</b> of lending <b>procedures</b> may be called for than is envisaged in the Report. In a freely functioning capital market the potential of government bonds is enormous, but this necessitates restructuring of the government bond market. The government bonds may then also be used as suitable hedging mechanisms by introducing options and futures trading. We recommend freeing up the operation of pension and provident fund to enable at least partial investment of such funds in risky securities. In the corporate sector, we believe that the current 2 : 1 debt equity norm is too high and not sustainable in the long term. We envisage that high debt levels and higher interest rates, combined with higher business risk may result in greater incidence of corporate sickness. This may call for various schemes for retrenched workers and amendment to land laws for easy exit of companies. On account of interdependencies across different policies, any sequencing of their implementation may be highly problematic. We therefore suggest a near simultaneity in the implementation of various reforms in order to build up a momentum which would be irreversible if people are to have confidence that the reforms will endure, and if we are to retain our credibility with international financial institutions. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years, the European {{integration}} process has increasingly resorted to flexible mechanisms of co-operation and decision-making, involving {{only a limited number}} of European Union (EU) Member States. The economic and financial crisis itself - and above all the response of the EU to the crisis - has undoubtedly favoured the trend. These ongoing asymmetric mechanisms deeply challenge the supranational architecture upon which the EU experience is based, determining a major change in the formal role and powers of both the European and national institutions. In particular, the European Parliament is incapable of adapting its internal functioning to the asymmetric schemes. In order to contrast these trends, some hypotheses of reform have been formulated, aiming either at building a new institution, a sort of Euro-Parliament; or at adapting the internal organisation of the EP to ongoing asymmetric tendencies limiting the voting rights of EPs. The essay challenges both these hypothesis, assuming that responding to the increasing asymmetries of the EU by making the existing institutions, above all the European Parliament, more asymmetric, would consistently endanger the cohesion of the Union and threaten the good functioning of its governing bodies. Rather, the approach should be based upon a re-consideration of the overall representative circuit upon which the EU is based. This implies that an even more asymmetric EU will have to rely on its traditional channels of parliamentary representation: what will need to change is not related to the nature or the format of parliamentary representation, but rather to its operative patterns, which should count on strengthened cooperation among parliaments in order to accommodate asymmetric tendencies in the EU governance with flexible forms of interaction in the <b>scrutiny</b> of such <b>procedures...</b>|$|R
40|$|At {{airports}} sustaining commercial operations, Runway Incursions, {{defined as}} the incorrect presence or manoeuvre of an aircraft, vehicle or person on a runway, constitute the most severe hazard to flight safety. In fact, the worst-ever accident in civil aviation to date, the collision of two Boeing B 747 s on Tenerife in March 1977 with 583 fatalities, {{was caused by a}} Runway Incursion. As early as 1986, a special investigation report of the National Transportation Safety Boards (NTSB), which is responsible for investigating aviation incidents and accidents in the USA, concluded that Human Factors issues and not technical malfunctions were the primary causal factors of Runway Incursions. This is remarkable, because although surface movement {{is one of the most}} challenging cockpit tasks, pilots are currently not supported by sophisticated assistance systems in this critical phase of flight, but still mainly rely on visual acquisition of their environment and Air Traffic Control (ATC) instructions conveyed via radio. The only mandatory additional equipment consists of paper charts, compass and Notices to Airmen (NOTAM). Consequently, the goal of this thesis is to investigate to what extent Runway Incursions can be attributed to an inadequate presentation or lack of required information on the flight deck, and how flight deck instrumentation will possibly have to be supplemented in order to increase safety in the airport environment. Following a <b>scrutiny</b> of current <b>procedures</b> for surface movement with respect to potential deficiencies, an in-depth analysis of 40 incidents and accidents is conducted to identify and categorize generic, recurring causal factors of Runway Incursions. Apart from several exceptions that can be attributed to incorrect ATC instructions or clearances, results clearly indicate that the investigated Runway Incursions were primarily caused by a lack of pilot situation awareness. The underlying reasons are a lack of suitable navigation aids, missing means of acquiring the surrounding traffic including potential conflicts, insufficient presentation of information on the airport operational environment (such as closed or restricted runways) or misunderstandings in the communication with ATC. In order to address these deficiencies, a holistic flight deck visualisation and warning concept based on Airport Moving Map (AMM) technology, an already commercially available database-driven electronic airport chart presentation, is developed in the frame of this thesis, integrating all of the information required for Runway Incursion avoidance in an intuitive fashion. In case the mere presentation of information is not sufficient to prevent a hazardous situation, e. g. due to the dynamics of an emerging traffic conflict, pilots are alerted in a manner consistent with current flight deck alerting systems. A prototypic realisation of the resulting onboard surveillance system is validated with airline pilots in field trials at Frankfurt and Prague airport, using a Navigation Test Vehicle, followed by a further evaluation campaign employing a Research Flight Simulator...|$|R
