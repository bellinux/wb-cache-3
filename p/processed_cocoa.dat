Methods: Thirty Wistar rats were designated {{on the basis}} of experimental diets which were given for 28 days. At the end of the feeding period, blood samples were drawn, and renal and hepatic tissues were excised from the experimental rat groups for functional tests and histological examinations, respectively. Results: Serum alanine aminotransferase activities of the experimental rat groups showed no significant difference (P >  0. 05) and were within a relatively narrow range of (32. 17  ±  4. 98) IU/L to (41. 00  ±  10. 85) IU/L, whereas serum aspartate aminotransferase activities gave wide variation within the range of (15. 67  ±  2. 13) IU/L to (34. 83  ±  8. 31) IU/L with P <  0. 05. Serum bilirubin concentrations of experimental rat groups were less than 1  mg/dL. Serum total protein and albumin concentrations varied within a relatively narrow range. Serum creatinine concentration was significantly lower (P <  0. 05) than serum urea concentration. Histology showed evidence of moderate disarrangement of hepatic tissue architecture and degenerated tubules as well as glomerular turfs.

Procyanidin content was determined by HPLC analysis, while the total polyphenol index (TPI), the antiradical activity as well as the reducing power were evaluated by the reaction with the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent, the decolorization assays of the ABTS radical (TEAC) and the Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) methods, respectively. The procyanidins content and profile were deeply affected by the different processing conditions: at the end of conching the STC-samples were characterized by a higher amount of monomers, compared to the LTC-ones which, in turn, resulted more polymerised as confirmed by the presence of P 10 polymers.

Ghana’s performance in export of cocoa has improved significantly since 1983. This observation is attributed to initiation of the Economic Recovery Program in 1983 (which created the right conditions for agricultural investment and helped address inefficiencies in marketing and fiscal disciplines), the Agricultural Services Rehabilitation Project (ASRP) between 1987 and 1990 (which helped in strengthening the capacity of agricultural research, extension and policy planning), opening up of the domestic market to competition through partial liberalization of internal marketing from the early 1990 s, establishment of a price stabilization system and continuous government support to the sector through increased public spending on infrastructure and productivity-enhancing innovations. Improvement in the export performance, anticipated increases in global demand and world price of cocoa, wide yield gap of Ghana, positive attitude of farmers towards supply of cocoa due to increased government support, and intensification of competition on the domestic market indicate potential for further improvement in Ghana’s production and export of cocoa. However, upon estimates obtained in the current study, to realize any further improvement in the performance of the cocoa subsector, measures should be put in place to bridge the wide yield gap, ensure continuous government support to various stakeholders in the supply chain, and tighten the loose border between Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire to help minimize smuggling in times of increasing farm gate price of cocoa in Côte d’Ivoire...|$|E
