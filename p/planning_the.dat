5|$|A {{grand jury}} petition, bearing over 1,400 {{signatures}} across 134 pages, was {{filed with the}} Tulsa County election board by Medlin on November 6, 1989. The petition alleged that local and state officials violated the state's open meetings, conspiracy, and conflict of interest laws while <b>planning</b> <b>the</b> turnpike. The election board certified the petition as meeting the required threshold of 1,000 signatures on December 15. Work on the turnpike continued despite the investigation.

5|$|Another {{public outcry}} arose when the {{government}}, seeking {{the support of}} ethnic minorities, allowed the opening of over 80 Polish schools in Lithuania. At the time, the Polish government was closing Lithuanian schools in the fiercely contested Vilnius Region. The coalition government directly confronted the Christian Democrats when it proposed a 1927 budget that reduced salaries to the clergy and subsidies to Catholic schools. Further controversies were created when the government's military reform program was revealed as a careless downsizing. Some 200 conservative military officers were fired. The military began <b>planning</b> <b>the</b> coup.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the Riverside Historic District, Jacksonville's first {{historic}} district, {{was added}} to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985; it now comprises 6870 acres and contains 2120 historic buildings. In 1989, the Avondale Historic District was added, and the following year the Jacksonville City Council established the Jacksonville Historic Preservation Commission in order to protect historic structures. Riverside Avondale Preservation has grown into one of the largest such organizations in the country. As a result of this focus on preservation and <b>planning,</b> <b>the</b> American Planning Association named Riverside and Avondale one of the country's top ten neighborhoods in 2010.|$|E

5|$|During the {{production}} of the season, Groening and Brooks pitched a live-action spin-off series centered in Krusty the Clown (expected to be portrayed by Dan Castellaneta) entitled Krusty (although they began <b>planning</b> <b>the</b> series since 1992). Groening and Michael Weithorn wrote a pilot episode where Krusty moved to Los Angeles and got his own talk show. A recurring joke throughout the script was that Krusty lived in a house on wooden stilts which were continuously being gnawed by beavers. Eventually, the contract negotiations fell apart and Groening decided to stop work on the project.|$|E
5|$|Few Australians were {{involved}} in <b>planning</b> <b>the</b> invasion.

5|$|In October 1964, at a {{ceremony}} in honour of Soviet cosmonauts, Brezhnev called for the strengthening of the Party apparatus.
