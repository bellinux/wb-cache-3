The only {{differences}} came in the form a different head gasket for the 4.6 Liter engine that brought compression ratio from 8.0:1 to 8.5:1. The standard A998 three-speed automatic transmission got wider gear ratios. The final technical change came in the midyear with a new head design with larger round intake ports, smaller spark <b>plug</b> <b>outlets</b> and a plastic valve cover; making a slightly more powerful engine.|$|R

50|$|During {{the last}} Ice Age {{the water level}} of the Dead Sea reached 180 m below sea level, about 240 m higher than it is today. It flooded the lower areas of the canyons along its banks, which became bays and begun to {{accumulate}} sediments. As the climatic conditions changed, about 20,000 years ago, the water level of the lake dropped, leaving the re-emergent canyons blocked with lake marl.Most canyons managed to cut through their <b>plugged</b> <b>outlets</b> and to resume their lower courses. However, Wadi Mujib, abandoned its former outlet by breaking through a cleft in the sandstone. This narrow cleft became the bottleneck of an enormous drainage basin with a huge discharge. During the years the cleft was scoured deeper and the gorge of Wadi Mujib was formed.|$|R

5000|$|In the West, {{the first}} fire piston {{was made in}} 1745 by the Abbot Agostino Ruffo of Verona, Italy, who was making a pair of air guns for the king of Portugal, John V. While Ruffo was testing a gun's air pump for leaks by <b>plugging</b> its <b>outlet</b> with a scrap of wood, he noticed that, after he had {{pressurized}} the pump, the wood had been scorched. Subsequently he found that tinder was ignited by the pump. Ruffo made an apparatus to study the phenomenon further. [...] An 1876 article in the New York Times claimed that the modern fire piston was reinvented independently in the west through experiments with the air gun, and not modeled after Asian designs.|$|R
2500|$|The {{downturn}} of the Mexican economy {{early in}} 1982 {{and a government}} decree banning the importation of [...] "luxury" [...] automotive accessories hit the country's auto industry. The 1982 VAM Gremlin returned as a slightly consolidated model. Both trim levels incorporated amber front parking lights and the AMC square pattern grille design {{that was used in}} U.S. domestic Eagle models. The base model incorporated chromed headlight bezels with blacked out internal areas while the X model were completely blacked out as also was the hood trim molding. The [...] I6 was upgraded {{for the first time since}} 1976, receiving a higher 8.5:1 compression ratio and net output of [...] at 4000rpm. This was achieved through a new head design that incorporated smaller spark <b>plug</b> <b>outlets</b> and a plastic valve cover. The A904 model automatic transmission was replaced in favor of the A998 model with wider gear ratios. The base model was similar to the prior year's except for new side trim and front end design. The X model saw the return of side decals the form of four thin stripes starting at the base of the B-pillar trim molding running all the way to the front edge of the fenders near the marker lights. A new silver [...] "GX" [...] decal appeared between the rear window and the right side tail light. For some reason, the sports steering wheel was replaced by the base design. The model was restricted to a three-speed automatic transmission with the novelty of the AMX/GT's console-type shifter boot and the rear differential changed to a [...] 3.07:1 ratio as used the year before with the now-unavailable four-speed manual.|$|R

50|$|A {{receptacle}} tester (outlet tester or socket tester) <b>plugs</b> into an <b>outlet,</b> and {{can detect}} {{some types of}} wiring errors. The particular error in wiring is shown by various combinations of three lights. Detectable errors include reversed hot/neutral, missing electrical ground or neutral, and others. However, leakage current through surge protective metal oxide varistors connected between neutral and ground of a power strip can give a false indication that a ground connection exists.|$|R

40|$|International audienceUsing {{microscopic}} particle image velocimetry, {{we examine}} the flow field around an oil droplet as it is formed by hydrodynamic focusing in an aqueous solution using a pressure-driven cross-channel microfluidic device. By detecting the temporal dependence of the instantaneous flow fields of the continuous phase in the dripping regime, we show that shear is not the primary mechanism that initiates droplet formation in our low flow rate and moderate capillary number experimental conditions. Instead, the advancing finger of oil partially and temporarily <b>plugs</b> the <b>outlet</b> channel, creating a pressure difference that builds up and is released when water from the side channels pushes {{the tip of the}} finger into the outlet channel, thereby facilitating the birth of the droplet by interfacial pinch-off that is primarily initiated by an extensional flow...|$|R
5000|$|Andrei Sarna-Wojcicki, a {{geologist}} {{emeritus of the}} U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), has claimed that the Carquinez Strait was likely formed about 640,000 to 700,000 years ago, while much of modern California was emerging from the Ice Age. The present Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin Valley were covered by a huge lake (now extinct), which has been called Lake Corcoran. Initially, this lake drained into the ocean through a valley near present-day Monterey. However, ongoing seismic activity raised the coastal mountains sufficiently to <b>plug</b> this <b>outlet.</b> Concurrently, ice melting off the Sierras raised the water level in Lake Corcoran until the lake began to carve a new outlet to the ocean. At some point, the coastal barrier collapsed between today's cities of Crockett and Benicia, releasing lake water in a cataclysmic flood.|$|R
