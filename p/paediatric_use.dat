40|$|Abstract Background Many ocular {{medications}} are {{prescribed for}} paediatric patients, {{but the evidence}} for their rational use is very scant. This study was planned to compare the availability and the licensing status of ocular medications marketed in Italy, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States of America (USA) related {{to the amount of}} published and un-published RCTs testing these drugs in the paediatric population. Methods A quantitative analysis was performed to evaluate the number of ocular medications with a paediatric license in Italy, the UK, and the USA. A literature search was also performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on ophthalmic pharmacological therapy in children aged Results In all, of 197 drugs identified, 68 (35 %) single drugs are licensed for <b>paediatric</b> <b>use</b> at least in one considered country, while 23 (12 %) were marketed in all three countries. More specifically, in Italy 43 single drugs (48 % of those marketed) had a paediatric license, while 39 (64 %) did in the UK and 22 (54 %) did in the USA. Only 13 drugs were marketed with a paediatric license in all countries. The percentage of drugs licensed for <b>paediatric</b> <b>use</b> and for which at least one RCT had been performed ranged between 51 % in Italy and 55 % in the USA. No published RCTs were found for 11 (48 %) drugs licensed for <b>paediatric</b> <b>use</b> in all three countries. In all, 74 (35 %) of the retrieved RCTs involved mydriatic/cycloplegic medications. A total of 62 RCTs (56 % completed) on 46 drugs were found in the international clinical trial registries. Cyclosporin and bevacizumab were being studied in many ongoing trials. Twenty-six drugs had new paediatric information approved by FDA based on new paediatric clinical trials, while only 4 PIPs were approved by EMA. Conclusions There is a pressing need for further research and clinical development in the pediatric ophthalmic area, where effective up-to-date treatments, and additional research and education on use in children, remain priorities. </p...|$|E

30|$|Rationale: Severe AKI can be {{associated}} with a total or partial absence of renal functional recovery, leading to CRI. <b>Paediatric</b> studies <b>using</b> long-term follow-up were the first to show that patients considered as completely recovered based on biological data can progress towards CRI within the 3 following years in 10  % of cases [222]. An incomplete recovery can lead to a normalization of the usual biological parameters (Scr), despite a decreased number of nephrons. This phenomenon leads to higher renal susceptibility in case of a new injury or during physiological ageing.|$|R

40|$|Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) {{currently}} on the market have been designed primarily for a target population of adult patients. In this paper, we describe some preliminary work that illustrates how a combination of user research and flow analysis (CFD) can be utilised to inform the development of inhalers suitable for <b>paediatric</b> <b>use.</b> In research, with children, we observed significant variations in inhalation profile {{and also in the}} ability to interpret instructions. The CFD work shows variations in deposition due to variations in physiology and inhalation profile. We conclude that the availability of new inhalation technologies that can reduce constraints on patients, together with appropriate human factors research and design analysis (such as CFD), the industry can develop more optimised paediatric inhalers for the paediatric market...|$|E
40|$|Anaesthetic eye drops for {{children}} in casualty departments across south east England It is a common practice to use topical anaesthetic drops to provide temporary relief and aid in {{the examination of the}} eyes when strong blepharospasm precludes thorough examination. Ophthalmology departments usually have several types of these—for example, amethocaine, oxybuprocaine (benoxinate), and proxymetacaine. The dura-tion and degree of discomfort caused by amethocaine is significantly higher than proxymetacaine, 1 2 whilst the difference in the discomfort between amethocaine and oxybuprocaine is minimal. 2 When dealing with children, therefore, it is recommended to use proxymetacaine drops. 1 It was my experience that Accident & Emergency (A&E) departments tend to have less choice of these drops. This survey was done to find out the availability of different anaesthetic drops, and the preference for <b>paediatric</b> <b>use</b> given a choice of the above three. Questionnaires were sent to 40 A&E departments across south east England. Thirty nine replied back, of which one department did not see any eye casualties. None of the 38 departments had proxymeta-caine. Twenty units had amethocaine alone and 10 units had oxybuprocaine alone. For <b>paediatric</b> <b>use,</b> these units were happy to use whatever drops were available within the unit. Eight units stocked amethocaine and oxybuprocaine, four of these were happy to use either of them on children and four used only oxybuprocaine. One of the latter pre-ferred proxymetacaine but had to contend with oxybuprocaine due to cost issues. Children are apprehensive about the instillation of any eye drops. Hence, it is desirable to use the least discomforting drops like proxymetacaine. For eye casualties, in majority of District General Hospitals, A&E departments are the first port of call. Hence, A&E units {{need to be aware of}} the benefit of proxymetacaine and stock them for paedia-tric use...|$|E

This study assesses whether this ISS threshold is appropriate when evaluating both mortality, and hospital-based indicators of morbidity, in a <b>paediatric</b> population <b>using</b> a large hospital trauma registry. Other registries and datasets using ISS > 15 as an inclusion criterion may exclude a substantial body of data relating to significantly morbid trauma patients...|$|R

40|$|Urticaria, {{defined by}} the {{presence}} of wheals and/or angioedema,is a common condition in children, prompting parents to consult physicians. For its successful management, paediatric-specific features must be taken into account, regarding the identification of eliciting triggers and pharmacological therapy. This review systematically discusses the current best-available evidence on spontaneous acute and chronic urticaria as well as physical and other urticaria types in children. Potential underlying causes, namely infections, food and drug hypersensitivity, autoreactivity and autoimmune or other conditions, and eliciting stimuli are considered, with practical recommendations for specific diagnostic approaches. Second-generation antihistamines are the mainstay of pharmacological treatment aimed at relief of symptoms, which require dose adjustment for <b>paediatric</b> <b>use.</b> Other therapeutic interventions are also discussed. In addition, unmet needs are highlighted, aiming to promote research into the paediatric population, ultimately aiming at the effective management of childhood urticaria...|$|E
