5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, {{television}} {{networks in the}} United States were restricted to owning {{no more than five}} local VHF television stations. This system, which evolved from similar FCC regulations governing radio, resulted in executives of {{television networks}} forming alliances with local station owners in order to air network <b>programs</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> U.S. These alliances were codified in network affiliation contracts; Paramount Television Network staff required affiliate station managers to sign a network contract even if the station only aired one Paramount program. At its peak in late 1950, the Paramount Television Network was distributing five television series a week to over 40 affiliated television stations. Most Paramount stations were in the United States, but at least two were Canadian stations.|$|E

25|$|There {{are various}} types of {{empowerment}} <b>programs</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> globe that empower youth through many different tactics and programs. Programs can operate {{in a variety of}} settings. The majority of programs operate in more than one setting, which may be a key factor in their success. The beneficial outcomes to youth empowerment programs are improved social skills, improved behavior, increased academic achievement, increased self-esteem and increased self-efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Following a sharp but {{short-lived}} Depression at {{the beginning}} of the decade, New York enjoyed a booming economy during the Roaring Twenties. New York suffered during the Great Depression, which began with the Wall Street crash on Black Tuesday in 1929. The Securities and Exchange Commission opened in 1934 to regulate the stock market. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected governor in 1928, and the state faced upwards of 25% unemployment. His Temporary Emergency Relief Agency, established in 1931, was the first work relief program in the nation and influenced the national Federal Emergency Relief Administration. Roosevelt was elected President in 1932 in part because of his promises to extend New Yorkstyle relief <b>programs</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> country via his New Deal. In 1932, Lake Placid was host to the III Olympic Winter Games.|$|E

25|$|The Tinkering Studio {{began in}} 2008 as an {{in-house}} program geared towards maker culture and a “think with your hands” approach. It is housed within {{the museum in}} a dedicated space in the South Gallery, where it runs free do-it-yourself activities for museum visitors; it also shares its work with a larger audience of educators in afterschool programs, schools, museums and other learning environments. It is being cited as a prototype for similar <b>programs</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> globe, including South Korea, Canada, India, and Saudi Arabia. The Exploratorium also operates as afterschool tinkering program in partnership with San Francisco chapters of the Boys and Girls Club. In 2012 the Exploratorium was awarded a grant to create the California Tinkering Network, {{in collaboration with the}} Community Science Workshops, Techbridge, the Discovery Science Center, the California Afterschool Network, and the California STEM Learning Network. These organizations partner with over 20 local afterschool or summer programs to provide STEM-enriched activities for children in underserved communities. The initiative was designed to test an adaptable model for providing tinkering activities to promote learning and development in an afterschool setting.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} Charles Courtney's {{career as a}} rowing coach was also very far-reaching. When Charles Courtney started his college {{coaching}} career at Cornell, few colleges in America were active in rowing other than Cornell; Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and Pennsylvania were the only other schools to have significant programs. Several of his former rowers would help expand the number of rowing schools by starting or developing rowing <b>programs</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> country. In 1900, Edwin Sweetland, who rowed varsity for Courtney in 1899, became the first rowing coach at Syracuse University. Mark Odell, who rowed Varsity for Cornell in 1897, was instrumental in establishing the rowing program at the University of Washington. In addition, The University of Wisconsin–Madison rowing program was started {{with the help of}} the University President Charles Kendall Adams, former President of Cornell during the beginning of Courtney's tenure. From his experiences with Courtney at Cornell, Adams knew how a strong athletic program could increase his University’s national reputation. In the spring of 1894, Adams hired Amos W. Marston, who rowed for Courtney from 1889 to 1892, as the first Wisconsin Badgers rowing coach.|$|E
500|$|Gershkovitch, {{known for}} his {{discipline}} and high performance standards, conducted the orchestra for twenty-nine years, gaining national attention for the ensemble and pioneering the youth orchestra movement. By the 1930s, PJS concerts were broadcast nationally on the CBS Radio Network. In 1956 and 1958 both NBC and CBS transmitted broadcasts of the orchestra's <b>programs</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> United States, and three transcribed programs were broadcast overseas from Voice of America in Washington, D.C. Gershkovitch was also responsible for adding a Preparatory Orchestra (later renamed the Conservatory Orchestra) due to increased membership. He tried to incorporate at least one American composition in each concert. Gershkovitch had a distinctive personality and a unique way with words, using expressions such as [...] "More nicely, can't you more?" [...] and [...] "Debussy is beauty, French beauty" [...] (as recollected in one former student's diary). For twenty-five years, David Campbell served as Master of Ceremonies for the Children's Concerts since Gershkovitch [...] "never gained a command of English sufficient enough for public use". Gershkovitch's often-quoted philosophy {{was that he did}} [...] "not teach music", but rather he taught [...] "young people through music". Though there were times he desired to conduct professional ensembles, Gershkovitch's primary concern was educating the youth. Apart from music education, he stressed the importance of proper conduct, manners, and [...] "values in life and art" [...] in order to build character. Following Gershkovitch's death in 1953, guest conductors led the orchestra for its thirtieth season– one conductor was Jacob Avshalomov, a Columbia University teacher and PJS alumnus who had studied under Gershkovitch while a student at Reed College (1939–1941).|$|E

Recalling the performances, IU stated on a 2013 episode of Happy Together that she disliked having to wear the girlish costumes and hairstyle fashioned for the song promotions. The performances were well-received and were once again labelled [...] "cute", reminiscent of reviews for [...] "Boo".|$|E

2500|$|The 1940 Stanford Indians {{football}} team, {{nicknamed the}} [...] "Wow Boys", represented Stanford University in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) intercollegiate competition during the 1940 season. First-year head coach Clark Shaughnessy inherited {{a team that}} finished with a 1–7–1 record the previous season. He installed {{his own version of}} the T formation, a system that had largely fallen into disuse since the 1890s and was viewed as obsolete. The Indians shocked observers when they won all ten of their games including the Rose Bowl, which prompted several selectors to declare them the 1940 national champions. Stanford's dramatic reversal of fortunes prompted football <b>programs</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> nation to abandon the single-wing formation in favor of the new T formation.|$|E
