40|$|<b>Pension</b> <b>scheme</b> {{governance}} is an {{area that}} has not historically attracted much attention from companies and academia alike. However, the importance of <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> governance has recently been realised and many companies are now trying to manage the risks that are inherent in their occupational <b>pension</b> <b>schemes.</b> Consequently, academic interest in the subject has also begun to increase and this paper will look at this burgeoning field of <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> governance. However, this paper has a radically different approach to the subject than the previous, more quantitative, research in that it will follow a qualitative research methodology of semi-structured interviews followed by an Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis of these interviews, which has previously not been undertaken. The aim of this research was to identify and understand the different experiences of <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> governance that exist in the pensions industry. Different experiences of <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> governance were found to exist in the pensions industry and these differences largely related to whether the research participant had experience of large or small <b>pension</b> <b>schemes.</b> What this research indicates is that there are many variances in the operation of <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> governance in practice with most of the best practices occurring with larger <b>pension</b> <b>schemes,</b> due to the impracticalities of these taking place on smaller <b>pension</b> <b>schemes.</b> Thus, this research suggests other governance mechanisms that could well be utilised by smaller <b>pension</b> <b>schemes</b> to improve their standards of governance. These mechanisms include: governance audits; codes of practice; and professional independent trustees. This research also indicates that it may well be useful for a review comparable to that conducted by Derek Higgs, on non-executive directors in public companies, to be conducted on the role and effectiveness of independent professional trustees in ensuring the good governance of <b>pension</b> <b>schemes...</b>|$|R

On 23 September 2013, the Supreme Court issued an interim order saying that [...] "no person should suffer for not getting Aadhaar" [...] as the government cannot deny a service to a resident if s/he does not possess Aadhaar, as it is voluntary and not mandatory. In another interim order on 11 August 2015, the Supreme Court of India ruled that [...] "UIDAI/Aadhaar will {{not be used for}} any other purposes except PDS, kerosene and LPG distribution system" [...] (which order was later amended to include Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, all types of <b>pensions</b> <b>schemes,</b> employee provident fund and the Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana), and made it clear that even for availing these facilities Aadhaar card will not be mandatory. On 27 March 2017, the Supreme Court affirmed that Aadhaar can not be mandatory for availing benefits under welfare schemes, though it can be mandatory for other purposes (such as income tax filings, bank accounts etc.). On June 9, 2017, the Supreme Court of India partially read down a legal provision (Section 139AA of the Income Tax Act) which mandated an individual to link their Aadhaar for filing their Income Tax Returns.|$|E

Also, the earnings returns to education are typically higher for females, presumably reflecting that there is greater potential for increased work hours (Jacobson et al. 2005 a, Stenberg 2011).

40|$|In many {{countries}} multi-pillar pension systems are being introduced, which include, as one component, privately managed defined contribution <b>pension</b> <b>schemes.</b> These arrangements are frequently mandatory {{and can be}} regarded as substituting for part of the social security system.

40|$|Redistribution is an {{inevitable}} feature of collective pension schemes. It is still largely {{an open question}} what people‘s preferences are regarding redistribution—both through <b>pensions</b> <b>schemes</b> {{as well as more}} generally. It would seem that economists have little to say about this question, as they routinely assume that people are predominantly selfish. Economic experiments have revealed, however, that most people do in fact have redistributional preferences that are not merely inspired by self-interest. In the closing parts of the paper we discuss whether and how these experimental results speak to the redistribution issues of pensions. For example, do they argue for or against mandatory participation? Should we have less redistribution and more actuarial fairness? How does this depend on the type of redistribution involved?...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{consider}} the prospects for pensions privatisation in Spain. Firstly, public pensions and complementary private <b>pensions</b> <b>schemes</b> are briefly described and their basic indicators compared. Next, financial projections for public pensions are discussed in order to introduce the need for radical reform of the existing scheme. Finally, in a more detailed manner, some of the factors upon which the attractiveness of private pensions depends are scrutinised. This in order to ascertain their ability to provide a sound alternative to social security. A major conclusion is that partial privatisation of pensions may benefit future pensioners if a crucial but rarely debated issue in Spain is properly dealt with, that is, the excessive cost of annuities in which retirement capitals should be converted upon retirement. ...|$|E

The study is a cohort design, where the data are pooled for 77251 individuals in six countries in 28 datasets covering multiple time periods from 1992 to 2010 using the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) Database. The analyses show that pension incomes in these societies are diversified in terms of public vs. private pension income, purchasing power parities (PPP) adjusted income amounts, and the shape of the income distribution.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the effect of the {{irreversibility}} of the retirement decision on labour supply after 60. According to the theory, when the retirement decision is an absorbing state, people tend to remain longer on the labour market to be able to benefit from changes in preferences or economic environment favourable to participation. Simulations performed on a sample of individuals with heterogeneous careers illustrate this result. When <b>pensions</b> <b>schemes</b> are actuarially fair, the irreversibility of the retirement decision leads to higher participation rates in the first years when retirement is allowed. Moreover labour supply around 60 increases with uncertainty. Simulations show that the impact of an increase in uncertainty on participation rates highly depends on the pension schemes. Whereas the effect is sensitive with actuarially fair systems, it is almost insignificant in the French Institutional setting where individual choices are highly constrained by the rules.

40|$|Please, do not quote. Life {{expectancy}} {{and fertility}} rates {{are the key}} factors of ageing populations in the world. The likely evolutions of these factors suggest an inescapable rise in the share of elderly people in the overall population; this sharp increase in dependency ratios will have important impacts on public finances, potential output, etc., and overall, on the financial equilibrium of retirement pension schemes. These forecasted difficulties have induced {{a lot of political}} reactions. Policymakers have realised for some time that deficits of the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) <b>pensions</b> <b>schemes</b> would quickly reach unsustainable levels, if no changes were introduced, whether in benefits or in contributions, so that reforms are often planned [OECD, 2000]. These reforms are of two types: parametric reforms within the PAYG system or reforms that are based on a partial or full shift towards funded schemes. · Parametric reforms of PAYG include rather marginal adjustments; with an increase of the number of potential beneficiaries the solutions appear to be rather simple: to pay more, or to pay longer or to receive less. Increased contribution or decreased benefits, raise of the pensionable age with strong incentives to postpone retirement decisions have been the main figures of thes...|$|E
40|$|In {{a number}} of {{countries}} one observes a steady decline in defined benefits <b>pensions</b> <b>schemes,</b> public or private, funded or unfunded, and a simultaneous expansion of defined contributions plans. One of the consequences of this trend is to deprive individuals {{at the time of their}} retirement from the benefit of collective annuitization. Collective annuities can be distinguished from individual ones in two ways. First, they tend to be cheaper because of their scale and because of inefficiencies in private annuity markets. Second they redistribute resources from short-lived to long-lived individuals. Our paper studies the role of collective annuities. Both their redistributive incidence and efficiency aspects are accounted for. We assume that lifetime is uncertain and that there is a positive correlation between longevity and earnings. Collective annuitization (in part or in total) can be imposed on private savings or it can be "bundled" with a redistributive pension scheme. We show that the case for applying collective annuitization to private savings is weak. The case is stronger when collective annuities are associated with redistributive pensions. However, even in that case, collective annuitization may mitigate the redistributive benefits associated with the pension system...|$|E

40|$|This CPB Discussion Paper {{addresses}} two policy {{questions with}} respect to public defined benefit (DB) <b>pension</b> <b>schemes.</b> Firstly, does a funded DB <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> increase welfare? Secondly, how large is the commitment problem of pension funds after an adverse capital market shock? This CPB Discussion Paper addresses two policy questions {{with respect to}} public defined benefit (DB) pension schemes: Firstly, does a funded DB <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> increase welfare? In other words: do the gains from intergenerational sharing of capital market risks outweigh the labour market distortions from <b>pension</b> <b>schemes?</b> Secondly, how large is the commitment problem of pension funds after an adverse capital market shock? The answer {{to the first question}} depends on the used welfare measure. If we use risk-neutral weights to aggregate the equivalent variations of different generations in different states of nature then a DB <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> is welfare increasing. If we use as weights the stochastic discount factors that corresponds to these states of nature, we conclude the opposite: a DB <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> reduces welfare. The probability that future households actually experience a welfare gain if the <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> is closed can be as large as 38 percent. So, a pure DB <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> has a large commitment problem: continuity will become at risk in case participation in the <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> is not mandatory. These results are most sensitive for the values of the labour supply elasticity, the risk aversion parameter and the mean and the standard deviation of the excess return on equity. ...|$|R
