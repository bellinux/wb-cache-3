5|$|From {{fewer than}} 6,120 white {{settlers}} in 1850, Minnesota's official population grew to over 1.7million by 1900. Each {{of the next}} six decades saw a 15 percent increase in population, reaching 3.4million in 1960.

5|$|On average, IIH {{occurs in}} about one per 100,000 people, and {{can occur in}} {{children}} and adults. The median age at diagnosis is 30. IIH occurs predominantly in women, especially in the ages 20 to 45, who are four to eight {{times more likely than}} men to be affected. Overweight and obesity strongly predispose a person to IIH: women who are more than ten <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> their ideal body weight are thirteen times more likely to develop IIH, and this figure goes up to nineteen times in women who are more than twenty <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> their ideal body weight. In men this relationship also exists, but the increase is only five-fold in those over 20 percent above their ideal body weight.|$|E
5|$|NVC has {{reportedly}} been {{an element of}} a bundle of interventions that produced dramatic changes in forensic psychiatric nursing settings in which {{a high level of}} violence is the norm. NVC was adopted, in combination with other interventions, in an effort to reduce violence. The interventions were said to reduce key violence indicators by 90 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> a three-year period in a medium security unit, and by around 50 percent in a single year in a maximum security unit.|$|E

5|$|During Danny Williams' time as premier the {{province}} experienced a major economic expansion, mainly {{as a result}} of the offshore oil industry. After years of sluggish growth and annual deficits {{the province}} started recording large surpluses, starting in 2006. While billions of dollars were paid down on the province's debt, government spending increased considerably. In his 2011 report Auditor General John Noseworthy noted that spending had increased by 47.4 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> a five-year period. Finance Minister Tom Marshall defended the spending practises by saying that the province had to play catchup after decades of deficits, and that the global recession forced all governments to hike spending to keep economies afloat.|$|E
5|$|ExactTarget {{went public}} in March 2012 and raised $161.5 million in funding on the New York Stock Exchange.

In 2012, its revenues grew 40 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> the preceding year. The following June, ExactTarget was acquired by salesforce.com for $2.5 billion. A few months later, salesforce.com said it was laying off 200 staff due to overlaps after the ExactTarget acquisition.

Denmark {{evacuated}} nearly all its Jews to nearby, neutral Sweden; the Danish resistance movement, {{with the assistance of}} many Danish citizens, evacuated 7,220 of the country's 7,800 Jews by sea to Sweden in vessels ranging from fishing boats to private yachts. The rescue allowed the vast majority of Denmark's Jewish population to avoid capture by the Nazis. Jews outside Europe under Axis occupation were also affected by the Holocaust in Italian Libya, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Iraq, Japan, and China.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1956, initial {{designs were}} {{presented}} by the two companies. Zip fuel was {{to be used in}} the afterburners to improve range by 10 to 15 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> conventional fuel. Both designs featured huge wing tip fuel tanks that could be jettisoned when their fuel was depleted before a supersonic dash to the target. The tanks also included the outer portions of the wing, which would also be jettisoned to produce a smaller wing suitable for supersonic speeds. Both became trapezoidal wings after ejection, at that time the highest performance planform known. They also featured flush cockpits to maintain the highest fineness ratio possible in spite of its effects on visibility.|$|E
5|$|On January 26, 2016, Bevin {{delivered}} a budget {{address to the}} General Assembly detailing his two-year budget proposal. The proposal cut the allocation for most state agencies by 9 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> the upcoming biennium, {{with most of the}} savings being redirected into the state pension system, which was among the worst funded in the nation. Public elementary and secondary education were spared from the cuts, as were social workers, public defenders, corrections officers, and Kentucky State Police employees, all of whom received raises under Bevin's proposal. Public colleges and universities were not exempt from the cuts, and Bevin called for a gradual move to performance-based funding for higher education, with all higher education funding tied to performance by 2020.|$|E

5|$|People whose CT scan shows a large hematoma, {{depressed}} {{level of}} consciousness, or focal neurologic signs {{may benefit from}} urgent surgical removal of the blood or occlusion of the bleeding site. The remainder are stabilized more extensively and undergo a transfemoral angiogram or CT angiogram later. It is hard to predict who will have a rebleed, yet it may happen {{at any time and}} carries a dismal prognosis. After the first 24hours have passed, rebleeding risk remains around 40 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> the subsequent fourweeks, suggesting that interventions should be aimed at reducing this risk as soon as possible. Some predictors of early rebleeding are high systolic blood pressure, the presence of a hematoma in the brain or ventricles, poor Hunt-Hess grade (III-IV), aneurysms in the posterior circulation, and an aneurysm >10mm in size.|$|E
5|$|The 2004 Emerald Bowl {{began with}} a 1:35p.m. PST kickoff time in SBC Park. Because the field had been {{converted}} from the baseball diamond typically used by the San Francisco Giants, both teams shared the same sideline during the game. Rainy conditions caused the field's natural grass surface to become muddier as the game progressed. Although 30,563 tickets were sold, an increase of 19 percent from the 2003 game, official in-stadium attendance was listed at 28,856, an increase of 28 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> the previous year. Despite New Mexico's closer proximity to the bowl site, Midshipmen fans comprised {{a large portion of}} the crowd; Navy directly sold 18,000 tickets prior to the game and was given credit for 22,000. The game aired live on ESPN2, with Eric Collins and Andre Ware serving as announcers. With a Nielsen rating of 2.04, the game was watched by over four million households, approximately 65 percent more viewers than the previous year.|$|E
5|$|The Act left range {{management}} policy unresolved in many respects, {{although it did}} specify that BLM and the Forest Service consult with state wildlife agencies. In practice, BLM struggled to accommodate the needs of feral horses among its other priorities (which included livestock grazing, prevention of soil erosion, and accommodating big game hunting). In November 1971, the BLM announced a major effort to save the Pryor Mountain herd from starvation after a poor summer growing season left vegetation on the range stunted. By 1974, the herd on the Pryor Mountain range {{was said to have}} increased by 17 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> the 1968 level, but there was strong disagreement over whether the population had actually increased.|$|E

5|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in the United States on April 14, 1998. Suavemente and American merengue singer Manny Manuel's album, Es Mi Tiempo, increased US tropical-music sales by 27 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> the previous year. On November 28, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified Suavemente gold for shipments of 500,000 copies, the first merengue record certified gold. The album was certified gold in Chile, platinum in Venezuela, and platinum in Central America. During the 1998 Christmas season, Suavemente was among the top-selling Latin albums in the United States. On February 20, 1999, Sony Discos president Oscar Llord {{expressed an interest in}} promoting Suavemente in Latin America and Europe since he believed that the album would sell over one million copies. In May, it sold 1,500,000 copies worldwide. By June 2007 Suavemente had sold 800,000 copies in the US, and by 2012 the album had sold an additional 64,000 copies in the US.|$|E
5|$|With {{the fuel}} price {{increases}} of the 2000s, the EPA and many companies {{have sought to}} increase diesel truck fuel economy. One such example is the hydraulic hybrid vehicle, which stores energy in hydraulic tanks and hydraulic motors (as opposed to the electric hybrid vehicle which uses batteries and regenerative brakes). Electric hybrid vehicles are another option, with savings of 35 to 60 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> traditional vehicles. Drivers themselves may improve fuel efficiency by using a method called progressive shifting, in which the driver shifts through the gears (typical trucks may have between 10 and 18 gears) {{in such a manner}} as to optimize the power range of the engine.|$|E
5|$|In March 1935 {{the threat}} from Nazi Germany {{prompted}} a series of expansion schemes which pushed the number of squadrons up to 163 (as per Expansion Scheme M, the last before the outbreak of war) {{and the number of}} aircraft to 2,549. But it was never fully implemented, and Scheme F, 124 Squadrons and 1,736 aircraft, was the only scheme that ran its full course. It did produce modern aircraft and it made adequate provision for reserves (75 percent), but again, the bomber forces received no less than 50 percent which averaged 57 <b>percent</b> <b>over</b> all schemes. Maritime air units never made up more than 12 per cent of British air strength. From a pre-expansion strength of just five squadrons, four of which were flying boats, the figure of maritime squadrons rose to 18 by September 1939, with a strength of just 176 aircraft. Some 16 of these were allocated to trade defence, but given Trenchard's policy (which was still in place after his retirement) of developing bombers for the maritime arm which could bolster the air offensive, most were not specialised ASW aircraft, and the Air Ministry was thoroughly uninterested in any aircraft which fell outside the bomber function.|$|E
