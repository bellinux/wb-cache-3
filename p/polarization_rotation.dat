40|$|We {{present a}} study of parity (P) violating <b>polarization</b> <b>rotations</b> of atoms in {{external}} electric fields. Five different types of rotations are identified {{and the consequences of}} time reversal invariance (T) are discussed. The role played by Zeldovich’s electric dipole moment of unstable states is elucidated. To calculate the effects, we use the standard model of elementary particle physics where P violation in atoms is due to the exchange of the Z boson between the quarks in the nucleus and the atomic electrons. We consider in detail hydrogen-like systems in n = 2 states, where n is the principal quantum number, especially 1 1 H, 4 2 He+, and 12 6 C 5 +. There one has the metastable 2 S 1 / 2 states which are separated from the 2 P 1 / 2 states with opposite parity only by the small Lamb shift leading to a relatively large P-violating state mixing. The nominal order of magnitude of the <b>polarization</b> <b>rotations</b> is 10 − 11 − 10 − 12 but we discuss ways to obtain in some cases large enhancement factors of order 104. We show that e. g. for 1 1 H one could in principle observe P-violating <b>polarization</b> <b>rotations</b> as large as a few percent, where for a statistically significant result one would need a total of 1015 polarized atoms.

50|$|Optical {{isolators}} {{are different}} from 1/4 wave plate based isolators because the Faraday rotator provides non-reciprocal rotation while maintaining linear polarization. That is, the <b>polarization</b> <b>rotation</b> due to the Faraday rotator is always in the same relative direction. So in the forward direction, the rotation is positive 45°. In the reverse direction, the rotation is −45°. This {{is due to the}} change in the relative magnetic field direction, positive one way, negative the other. This then adds to a total of 90° when the light travels in the forward direction and then the negative direction. This allows the higher isolation to be achieved.|$|E
50|$|Magnetically driven {{ferroelectricity}} is {{also caused}} by inhomogeneous magnetoelectric interaction. This effect appears {{due to the}} coupling between inhomogeneous order parameters. It was also called as flexomagnetoelectric effect. Usually it is describing using the Lifshitz invariant (i.e. single-constant coupling term). It was shown that in general case of cubic hexoctahedral crystal the four phenomenological constants approach is correct. The flexomagnetoelectric effect appears in spiral multiferroics or micromagnetic structures like domain walls and magnetic vortexes. Ferroelectricity developed from micromagnetic structure can appear in any magnetic material even in centrosymmetric one. Building of symmetry classification of domain walls leads to determination {{of the type of}} electric <b>polarization</b> <b>rotation</b> in volume of any magnetic domain wall. Existing symmetry classification of magnetic domain walls was applied for predictions of electric polarization spatial distribution in their volumes.

40|$|In this paper, <b>polarization</b> <b>rotation</b> {{due to optical}} {{waveguide}} bending is analytically and numerically investigated. It is shown {{that the process of}} polarization conversion in the bend strictly depends on the characteristics of the straight waveguide. The strength of polarization coupling linearly increases with the waveguide refractive index contrast, whereas birefringence is responsible for the phase mismatch that limits the conversion efficiency. Waveguides with refractive index profile symmetrical in the direction orthogonal to the plane of the bend do not exhibit <b>polarization</b> <b>rotation.</b> Inside optical ring resonators, <b>polarization</b> <b>rotation</b> induced by waveguide bending is found to be highly enhanced by the cavity effect, which gives rise to strongly frequency dependent <b>polarization</b> <b>rotation</b> and dramatically alters the ring's spectral response.

The definition of polarization angle in BK 14 maps has gone through self-calibration in which the overall angle is adjusted to minimize the observed TB and EB power spectra. After this procedure, the QU maps lose sensitivity to a uniform <b>polarization</b> <b>rotation</b> but are still sensitive to anisotropies of <b>polarization</b> <b>rotation.</b> This analysis places constraints on the anisotropies of <b>polarization</b> <b>rotation,</b> which could be generated by CMB photons interacting with axion-like pseudoscalar fields or Faraday rotation induced by primordial magnetic fields. The sensitivity of BK 14 maps (∼ 3 μK-arcmin) makes it possible to reconstruct anisotropies of <b>polarization</b> <b>rotation</b> angle and measure their angular power spectrum much more precisely than previous attempts. Our data are found to be consistent with no <b>polarization</b> <b>rotation</b> anisotropies, improving the upper bound on the amplitude of the rotation angle spectrum by roughly an order of magnitude compared to the previous best constraints.

40|$|CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) {{polarization}} observations test {{many aspects}} of cosmological models. Effective pseudoscalar-photon interaction(s) would induce a <b>rotation</b> of linear <b>polarization</b> of electromagnetic wave propagating with cosmological distance in various cosmological models. CMB polarization observations are superb tests of these models and {{have the potential to}} discover new fundamental physics. Pseudoscalar-photon interaction is proportional to the gradient of the pseudoscalar field. From phenomenological point of view, this gradient could be neutrino number asymmetry, other density current, or a constant vector. In these situations, Lorentz invariance or CPT may effectively be violated. In this paper, we review these results and anticipate what more precise observations can tell us about fundamental physics, inflation, etc. Better accuracy in CMB polarization observation is expected from PLANCK mission to be launched this year. Dedicated CMB polarization observers like B-Pol mission, CMBpol mission and LiteBIRD mission would probe this fundamental issue more deeply in the future. With these sensitivities, cosmic <b>polarization</b> <b>rotations</b> from effective pseudoscalar-photon interaction, Faraday <b>polarization</b> <b>rotations</b> from primordial and large-scale magnetic field, and tensor modes effects would have chances to be detected and distinguished.
