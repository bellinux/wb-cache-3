The Implicit Steger -Warming flux vector splitting method {{is used for the}} numerical computation on air-water compressible flow problems. The results for pressure wave <b>propagation,</b> <b>celerity</b> or speed of sound and mass flow rate for different values of mass ratio were obtained. It was observed that the propagation of pressure along the pipeline and the mass flow rate there decreases along the pipe and maintained near a steady flow until it reaches the downstream of the pipe signifying the effect of gas build up during the pump control in pipeline...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of mooring cables for marine structures is scale-dependent, and perfect dynamic similitude between full-scale prototypes and small-scale physical model tests {{is difficult to}} achieve. The best possible scaling is here sought {{by means of a}} specific set of dimensionless parameters, and the model accuracy is also evaluated by two alternative sets of dimensionless parameters. A special feature of the presented experiment is that a chain was scaled to have correct <b>propagation</b> <b>celerity</b> for longitudinal elastic waves, thus providing perfect geometrical and dynamic scaling in vacuum, which is unique. The scaling error due to incorrect Reynolds number seemed to be of minor importance. The 33 m experimental chain could then be considered a scaled 76 mm stud chain with the length 1240 m, i. e., at the length scale of 1 : 37. 6. Due to the correct elastic scale, the physical model was able to reproduce the effect of snatch loads giving rise to tensional shock waves propagating along the cable. The results from the experiment were used to validate the newly developed cable-dynamics code, MooDy, which utilises a discontinuous Galerkin FEM formulation. The validation of MooDy proved to be successful for the presented experiments. The experimental data is made available here for validation of other numerical codes by publishing digitised time series of two of the experiments...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results from detailed experiments of the statistical structure of turbulence pressure fluctuations {{at the bottom of}} hydraulic jumps, with special reference to the spillway stilling basins lining design. Here, the whole spatial correlation structure of the fluctuating pressure field is required in order to evaluate slab stability. This is computed via simultaneous acquisition of the point pressure fluctuations on a dense grid in the hydraulic jump region, requiring a severe experimental work. As an alternative, one can evaluate the pressure spatial correlation structure via autocorrelation using one point pressure acquisition and applying the Taylor hypothesis. To adopt the Taylor hypothesis, one must know the pressure <b>propagation</b> <b>celerity</b> in space that can be obtained by comparing the whole spatial pressure correlation with the pivot point pressure autocorrelation. The experiments were performed by simultaneous pressure acquisitions {{at the bottom of a}} hydraulic jump for Froude numbers of the incident flow ranging from 4. 9 to 10. 3. From experiments, a criterion to define the pressure celerity as a function of the incident flow velocity is presented. The results highlight a good agreement between the relevant pressure statistical parameters as measured and the ones computed using the Taylor hypothesis. The comparison between the slab thicknesses, as computed via Taylor hypothesis, with the ones retrievable in literature, as obtained by direct force measurement on instrumented slabs in laboratory conditions, highlights the accuracy of the proposed approach that presents undeniable practical advantages...|$|E

50|$|The AM radio {{problem of}} {{interference}} at night was {{addressed in a}} different way. At the time FM was set up, the available frequencies were far higher in the spectrum than those used for AM radio - {{by a factor of}} approximately 100. Using these frequencies meant that even at far higher power, the range of a given FM signal was much shorter; thus its market was more local than for AM radio. The reception range at night is the same as in the daytime. All FM broadcast transmissions are line-of-sight, and ionospheric bounce is not viable. The much larger bandwidths, compared to AM and SSB, are more susceptible to phase dispersion. <b>Propagation</b> speeds (<b>celerities)</b> are fastest in the ionosphere at the lowest sideband frequency. The celerity difference between the highest and lowest sidebands is quite apparent to the listener. Such distortion occurs up to frequencies of approximately 50 MHz. Higher frequencies do not reflect from the ionosphere, nor from storm clouds. Moon reflections have been used in some experiments, but require impractical power levels.|$|R
40|$|Some {{cases of}} damage {{experienced}} on chute and spillway stilling basins operating under flood conditions {{have shown the}} importance to understanding the hydrodynamic force involved {{in the design of}} the lining. The computations of the slab uplift force, starting from the pressure field acting on the bottom, require the knowledge of the spatial covariance function of the fluctuating pressures in hydraulic jump region. This needs the simultaneous acquisition of pressure data in a large number of mesh points in the slab area. From an experimental point of view, this simultaneous acquisition at a large number of probes can be prohibitive because it is too expensive in terms of time consumption and laboratory setup. To overcome these problems one can invoke the Taylor hypothesis that allows defining the spatial correlation via autocorrelation at a single point, by assuming a proper value of the <b>propagation</b> <b>celerity</b> of the fluctuating pressure. The objective of this paper is to explore the validity of the Taylor hypothesis and provide a criterion to define this celerity. This is performed via an experimental analysis, for several Froude numbers of the hydraulic jump incident flow. For all test series, the pressure spatial correlation related to several pivot points was obtained. By comparison with autocorrelation in time-resolved single-point measurements at the pivot, the pressure celerity value on the slab surface was obtained. At constant Froude number, a relationship able to define this celerity in space is pointed out. The spatial covariance of pressure fluctuations, as calculated by the proposed approach, shows a good agreement with measurements and verifies the validity of the Taylor hypothesis. As a consequence the possibility is highlighted to use single point pressure measurements in order to estimate the force acting on a slab in spillway stilling basins...|$|E
40|$|The {{stability}} of slab protection {{at the bottom}} of spillway stilling basins or plunge pools downstream of large dams came to the great practical interest when the protection under the hydraulic jump stilling basins in some hydraulic plants was seriously damaged by floods smaller than maximum design value. This thesis offers novel practical design criteria to define the concrete thickness of spillway stilling basins and plunge pools lining. In the case of spillway stilling basins, the study presents a new experimental procedure that can define the global instantaneous uplift force. Results from detailed experiments of the statistical structure of turbulence pressure fluctuations {{at the bottom of}} hydraulic jumps is reported. Here, the whole spatial correlation structure of the fluctuating pressure field is required in order to evaluate slab stability. This is computed via simultaneous acquisition of the point pressure fluctuations on a dense grid in the hydraulic jump region, requiring a severe experimental work. As an alternative, one can evaluate the pressure spatial correlation structure via auto-correlation using one point pressure acquisition and applying the Taylor hypothesis. To adopt the Taylor hypothesis, one must know the pressure <b>propagation</b> <b>celerity</b> in space that can be obtained by comparing the whole spatial pressure correlation with the pivot point pressure auto-correlation. The experiments were performed by simultaneous pressure acquisitions {{at the bottom of a}} hydraulic jump for Froude numbers of the incident flow ranging from 4. 9 to 10. 3. From experiments, a criterion to define the pressure celerity as a function of the incident flow velocity is presented. The results highlight a good agreement between the relevant pressure statistical parameters as measured and the ones computed using the Taylor hypothesis. The comparison between the slab thicknesses, as computed via Taylor hypothesis, with the ones retrievable in literature, as obtained by direct force measurement on instrumented slabs in laboratory conditions, highlights the accuracy of the proposed approach that presents undeniable practical advantages. While this simplified approach based on Taylor hypothesis is used to assess the pressure field acting on the slab, the pressure propagation at the lower surface of the slab is evaluated using a 3 D model based on unsteady flow analysis of seepage through porous media. By this approach, it is possible to consider the effect of finite thickness foundation layers, typical in the case of earth dams, rock-fill dams and in other dam types. Slabs with unsealed joints are considered and compared to the case of sealed joints. The dynamic behavior of anchored slabs is also investigated. These results are relevant to a robust and safe design and maintenance of stilling basins downstream of large dams. In the case of plunge pools, the {{stability of}} concrete slabs or rock blocks under the impact of an impinging jet is theoretically analyzed, with reference to the mean characteristics of the flow field: pressure and velocity. In cases when the mean components are relevant respect to the fluctuating ones this analysis is exhausting. In other cases, a separate evaluation of the fluctuation effects in lining design is treated, by means of experimental evidences. The mean dynamic pressure at the bottom depends strongly on the impingement angle that assumes a relevant role in the design of floor protections. In plunge pools, that are confined upstream by the presence of the drop structure, the impingement angle is theoretically determined by mass balance and momentum conservation, resulting independent on the jet entrance angle at the plunge pool water surface. The theoretical results are compared with literature experimental evidences and numerical simulations. This highlights the capability of the proposed theoretical framework to correctly interpret the physical phenomena and to produce suitable engineering approaches...|$|E
40|$|River bed {{degradation}} {{is sometimes}} counteracted with nourishment of sediment material. Numerical models — which include Hirano’s sediment continuity model for mixed-size sediment — {{can be used}} to predict the transport of different sediment fractions (the waves due to spatial variations in the grain size distribution of the bed material are here called Ribberink waves) in the dumped material to find an optimal grain size distribution of the nourishment. Little is known how well these numerical predictions represent physical reality. The uncertainty in predictions of the behaviour of the transport of mixed-size sediment can have severe impact: the grain size distribution influences degradation and aggradation processes and bed friction, both, directly or indirectly, influence water levels and flow velocities that are important for designing measures for hinterland protection. Moreover, numerical models predict Ribberink waves travelling faster than associated bed level perturbations (De Vries waves), which is never observed in reality. In order to gain insight into the behaviour of morphodynamic changes with mixed-size sediment — especially with regards to the Ribberink waves — two flume experiments were conducted in the Water Lab of Delft University of Technology. The first experiment is a case with uniform tracer sediment, installing a shoal of different colour than the sediment in the downstream part of the flume. The shoal was installed for the upstream end. Comparing the outcomes of the latter experiment with a numerical simulation gives insight into the question if the Ribberink wave travelling faster than the De Vries wave is an artefact of the Hirano model or that it has physical meaning and relevance. The second experiment was an experiment with a bimodal sediment mixture. A shoal consisting of the coarser fraction is installed at the upstream part of the flume. The coarse fraction has a different colour than the fine fraction so {{that we were able to}} track it through the domain. The tracer experiment shows a distinct propagation of the shoal through the domain. Downstream of the shoal no degradation occurred. The material initially present in the shoal did not travel faster than the shoal. The numerical simulation of the experiment shows tracer material being transported faster than the shoal. The tracer material spread over the bed downstream of the shoal, reaching the end of the computational domain before the end of the simulation. The mixed-size sediment experiment shows a distinct propagation of the shoal through the domain (De Vries wave), preceded by an degradational wave (Ribberink wave). This degradational wave is caused by the spatial increase of the sediment transport rate, which is the net effect of: (a) a streamwise increasing flow depth; (b) a streamwise decreasing average grain size diameter of the bed surface, and; (c) a turbulent recirculation zone increasing local sediment transport capacities. In the area of degradation, the bed gradually becomes finer than the initial situation. A numerical reproduction of this experiment reproduced the experiment well, showing the same <b>propagation</b> <b>celerity</b> of the shoal and the associated erosion wave (but less deep), but shows no significant change of the grain size distribution compared to the initial bed of the bed downstream of the shoal. The predicted Ribberink wave thus travels with the same celerity as the measured Ribberink wave and does not precedes the De Vries wave. The conclusions of this thesis show that the grain size distribution of a sediment nourishment is of great influence on the propagation of the nourished material and on bed level changes downstream of the nourishment. As concluded from the flume experiments, when the nourished material (a hump similar to the shoal of the conducted experiments in this thesis) is coarser than the river bed, an erosional wave downstream of the nourishment will arise, travelling with the same celerity as the nourished material. If the nourishment is done to protect or counteract river bed degradation, this erosional effect caused by the shoal should be considered seriously.

40|$|Observations in {{estuaries}} {{indicate that}} an amplified tidal wave moves considerably faster than {{is indicated by}} the classical equation for wave <b>propagation.</b> Similarly, the <b>celerity</b> of <b>propagation</b> is lower if the tidal wave is damped. This phenomenon is clearly observed in the Schelde estuary (located in the Netherlands and Belgium) and in the Incomati estuary in Mozambique. In the Incomati, the tidal wave is damped throughout, whereas in the Schelde the tidal range increases from the mouth until the city of Antwerp, after which it decreases until Gent. This paper derives a new analytical expression for the celerity of the tidal wave {{that takes into account}} the effect of tidal damping, as an expansion of the classical equation for tidal wave propagation. In the new equation the phase lag between high water and high water slack plays a crucial role. It {{is one of the main}} parameters determining tidal wave propagation in alluvial estuaries. The equation is successfully applied to observations in the Schelde and the Incomati. Water ManagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of large}} amplitude second mode internal solitary waves has been investigated. Waves were {{generated in the}} laboratory {{by a variety of}} methods and were observed using dye and particle visualisation techniques. Observations of wave generation, propagation and dissipation were used to develop new theories about the behaviour of such waves. Waves were generated by exchange flow, forced inflow and gravity collapse. The generation sequence was found to be similar for all three methods, with the gravity collapse technique allowing the most rapid and repeatable generation of second mode waves. External <b>propagation</b> characteristics (wave <b>celerity</b> and geometry) were investigated using waves of dimensionless amplitude up to a/h = 11. 6. It was found that wave geometry was described well by existing theory over the entire range of amplitudes, but the existing wave celerity relationships were only accurate up to a/h ≌ 3. A new analytical approach produced a relationship which is applicable to all large amplitude waves. Internal propagation characteristics (internal circulation, entrainment and mass transport) were investigated using both particle visualisation and laser induced fluorescence techniques. It was found that internal circulation differs from the pattern suggested by existing numerical models. The interior of the wave is made up of an assemblage of vortices, symmetrical about the wave centreline, with a net flow rearwards along the centreline. These vortices are seen {{to play an important role}} in the entrainment of fluid into the wave. Entrainment appears to be caused by a non-symmetric Holmboe instability at the wave boundary. The entrainment into and expulsion of fluid from the wave results in the flushing of fluid from the wave. Measurements indicate that the rate of flushing is linearly proportional to distance and Richardson number during the primary flushing phase (from 100 % to 10 % tracer concentration). During the secondary flushing phase (from 10 % to 1 % tracer concentration) the flushing rate is lower but also linearly proportional to distance and Richardson number. Wave dissipation experiments indicate that wave amplitude decay rate is constant for any wave but varies with densimetric factor. Waves with larger densimetric factors decay at a slower rate. An expression for wave energy was formulated and the wave energy decay rate was examined. It was found that the radiation of first mode waves does not provide a significant contribution to wave decay. Wall shear was quantified and found to vary with flume width. In this study it was responsible for approximately 9 % of the dissipation rate. The remaining dissipation is due to fluid drag (interfacial shear, pressure drag and mixing) and was quantified by a drag coefficient. The drag coefficient varies with the inverse of the cube root of densimetric factor...|$|R
