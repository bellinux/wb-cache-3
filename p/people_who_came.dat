5|$|Trilingualism {{was perhaps}} not {{uncommon}} among educated <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>came</b> from regions where a language other than Latin or Greek was spoken. The Latin novelist Apuleius also wrote in Greek, and had learned Punic from his mother. The Babatha Archive is a suggestive example of practical multilingualism. These papyri, {{named for a}} Jewish woman {{in the province of}} Arabia and dating from 93 to 132 AD, mostly employ Aramaic, the local language, written in Greek characters with Semitic and Latin influences; a petition to the Roman governor, however, was written in Greek.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October 1959 the Admiralty {{announced}} that Vanguard would be scrapped, {{as she was}} considered obsolete and too expensive to maintain. She was decommissioned on 7 June 1960 and sold to the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain for £560,000. On 4 August 1960, when the ship {{was scheduled to be}} towed from Portsmouth to the breaker's yard at Faslane, Scotland, the whole of the Southsea sea front was packed with <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>came</b> to see her off. As Vanguard was being towed towards the harbour entrance, she slewed across the harbour and ran aground near the Still & West pub. She was pulled off by five tugboats an hour later, and made her final exit from Portsmouth. Five days later she arrived at Faslane, and by mid-1962 the demolition process was complete; she was the last British battleship to be scrapped.|$|E

5|$|The canal {{arrived at}} Shannon Harbour in 1804, {{and the water}} {{transport}} facilities stimulated the growth of existing industries and encouraged the establishment of new ones. Neat two and three-storey houses were built {{on each side of}} the road in Banagher to provide shops and dwellings for the merchants and other <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>came</b> to live there for the canal business. In 1834, there was a distillery, a brewery, two tanyards, a malthouse and corn mills in full operation in the town. Several craftsmen carried on industries in smaller workshops and in their homes. With the increase in trade and manufactures went a corresponding increase in population. In 1800, the population was estimated at 1500; in 1841, it was 2836, and in 1846, it was estimated at 3000.|$|E

Scully {{explains}} Ariel McKesson died of heart failure and then was burned to cover something up.

All but Myron Stefaniuk are now dead. Doggett and Scully find Myron and ask him about Ernie Stefaniuk, one of the hunters from 1956, who he reveals disappeared a long time ago. The two eventually track down Ernie Stefaniuk, who tells them that he hid on an island {{in the middle of the}} town's lake with his wife, Ariel, for 44 years. Ernie says that the bat creature kills anyone with Ernie’s scent on them, so he had burned his wife’s body to try and cover up the scent. He informs them that it hunts only at night and Myron is in danger. Doggett goes back to find Myron only to be attacked and badly torn up by the creature at the river.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} {{political}} consciousness started after {{the establishment of}} the Bombay Presidency Association on 31 January 1885. The Bombay Millowners' Association was formed in February 1875 by Dinshaw Maneckji Petit in order to lourdes central school protect interests of workers threatened by possible factory and tariff legislation by the British. The first session of the Indian National Congress was held in Bombay from 28–31 December 1885. The Bombay Municipal Act was enacted in 1888 which gave the British Government wide powers of interference in civic matters. The Victoria Terminus of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, one of the finest stations in the world, was completed in May 1888. The concept of Dabbawalas (lunch box delivery man) originated in the 1890s when British <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>came</b> to Bombay did not like the local food. So the Dabbawala service was set up to bring lunch to these people in their workplace straight from their home. On 11 August 1893, a serious communal riot took place between the Hindus and Muslims, when a Shiva temple was attacked by Muslims in Bombay. 75 people were killed and 350 were injured. In September 1896, Bombay was hit by a bubonic plague epidemic where the death toll was estimated at 1,900 people per week. Around 850,000, amounting to half of the population, fled Bombay during this time. On 9 March 1898, there was a serious riot which started with a sudden outbreak of hostility against the measures adopted by Government for suppression of plague. The riot led to a strike of dock and railway workers which paralysed the city for a few days. The significant results of the plague was the creation of the Bombay City Improvement Trust on 9 December 1898 and the Haffkine Institute on 10 January 1899 by Waldemar Haffkine. The Dadar-Matunga-Wadala-Sion scheme, the first planned suburban scheme in Bombay, was formulated in 1899–1900 by the Bombay City Improvement Trust to relieve congestion in the centre of the town, following the plague epidemics. The cotton mill industry was adversely affected during 1900 and 1901 due to the flight of workers because of the plague.|$|E
