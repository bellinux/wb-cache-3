5|$|As {{the lines}} near Quebec City, the {{northern}} <b>power</b> <b>line</b> rejoins {{the other two}} 735kV power lines. The three lines, paralleled by another 735kV <b>power</b> <b>line</b> some distance to the north, span over the Saint Lawrence River to the South Shore region, where the lines form loops encompassing part of the Saint Lawrence River and the south shore. The loops are also connected to the ring of 735kV power lines around Montreal and power lines running south from James Bay.|$|E

50|$|General aviation, hang gliding, paragliding, skydiving, balloon, and {{kite flying}} must avoid {{accidental}} contact with <b>power</b> <b>lines.</b> Nearly every kite product warns users {{to stay away}} from <b>power</b> <b>lines.</b> Deaths occur when aircraft crash into <b>power</b> <b>lines.</b> Some <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> are marked with obstruction makers, especially near air strips or over waterways that may support floatplane operations. The placement of <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> sometimes use up sites that would otherwise be used by hang gliders.|$|R
40|$|In {{graduation}} thesis {{the main}} features and theoretical frameworks of terrestrial and airborne laser scanning are presented. The algorithm for Hough transform that is described in detail, was used for searching <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> in a point cloud and on a raster that is generalized from the laser scanning data. The whole procedure of extraction of <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> is described from the pre-processing of data to the final results. Our own program was used for automatic extraction of <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> from pre-treated point cloud. Automatic extraction of <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> was tested from the raster with another program of our own. Both programs that are mentioned above were written in Matlab programming language. In order to increase the effectiveness of both programs, the redundant points that do not represent <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> were eliminated by LAStools. Effectiveness of the methods was estimated in two ways. First it was estimated visually and then by comparing the calculated coordinates of identical intersections of <b>power</b> <b>lines.</b> Estimation was made for all four examples (automatic extraction of <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> and calculation of coordinates of intersections of <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> in the point cloud of terrestrial laser scanning and airborne laser scanning; automatic extraction of <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> and calculation of coordinates of intersections of <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> on raster that is generalized from the terrestrial and airborne laser scanning data). The effect of pre-treated data on processing speed of the program that automatically extracts <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> was evaluated. At the end there are ideas for possible improvements of the methodology and guidelines for further development...|$|R

40|$|Our {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the Upper-Kiskunság region, Central Hungary, which hosts the largest Pannonian population of the Great Bustard (Otis tarda). The influence of the presence of aboveground medium voltage <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> on displaying site selection of Great Bustard males was investigated. The results revealed that displaying males totally reject the sites located within 350 - 400 m or closer to medium voltage <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> as displaying sites and show relative rejection towards potential displaying sites located at a distance between 500 and 1000 m far from <b>power</b> <b>lines.</b> Surprisingly, the overall negative effects influence much larger part of the potential displaying grounds, up to the distance to 3500 m from <b>power</b> <b>lines.</b> It can be declared that <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> reduce the extent of suitable displaying sites of the Great Bustards in the Upper-Kiskunság region. Accordingly, installation of new above-ground <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> (and other kind of wires, such as high voltage <b>power</b> <b>lines,</b> optical cables etc.) would further reduce the extent of suitable displaying sites...|$|R
50|$|Non-historic streets {{fall into}} two categories: Those areas with {{underground}} <b>power</b> <b>lines,</b> and those ares with above-ground <b>power</b> <b>lines.</b> Areas with underground <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> may use any type of pole, although the Cobrahead Pendant Pole is used only when other types are cost-prohibitive. Areas with above-ground <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> must use the Decorative Teardrop Pole, although the Cobrahead Pendant can be used if the Teardrop Pole is cost prohibitive. DDOT recommends use of the Cobrahead Pendant Poles because they are economical.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceThis {{research}} {{presented a}} novel method for {{transmission and distribution}} <b>lines</b> inspection. <b>Power</b> <b>lines</b> inspection can guarantee the performance of power system stability and increase the lifetime of <b>power</b> <b>lines.</b> An advanced <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> inspection can prevent massive power outages due to line failures, which {{is still one of}} the major challenges in modern power system. Traditiional method is using human squads to perform inspections. Due to the remoted locations of <b>power</b> <b>lines,</b> and various geographical conditions, it is not hte most efficient solution by dispatching human squads. Another popular method is using helicopters to inspect <b>power</b> <b>lines,</b> which is costly and there are limitations due to weather conditions. In this research, a combination of Scale Ivariant Feature Transform algorithm and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> real-time inspection system is presented. SIFT algorithm is widely used in object recognition, and it can help USAVs to reduce the vibration problems due to wind or other weather issues, while videoing <b>power</b> <b>lines.</b> The advantage of SIFT method of being invariant to image translation, scaling and rotation has been fully implemented in the proposed work. The video is processing to ground station and the final inspection analysis is performed frame by frame to locate or to recognize potentioal unhealty <b>power</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|R
5|$|Norsk Hydro {{announced}} in 1963 a savings plan for its four plants in Norway; Chief Executive Officer Rolf Østbye {{made it clear}} that new technology in the production of ammonia would force the closure of the plant at Rjukan, {{and replace it with a}} petroleum-based process at Herøya. The Rjukan situation, as it was named in the press, became a source of conflict between the local community and Norsk Hydro; initially 250 jobs were to be moved to Herøya, but in 1964 Norsk Hydro applied for permission to build a <b>power</b> <b>line</b> from Rjukan to Herøya—what would become the death sentence for the Rjukan Line. Permission for the construction of the <b>power</b> <b>line</b> was granted in 1968. Production of fertilizer was moved to Herøya and Glomfjord, and Rjukan transferred to production of kalkammonsalpeter in 1963 and ammonium nitrate in 1964.|$|E

5|$|The James Bay {{hydroelectric}} dam complex contains several {{relatively short}} 735kV <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> that send electricity to three principal substations, ordered from west to east: Radisson, Chissibi, and Lemoyne. From these substations, six 735kV <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> traverse the vast expanses of taiga and boreal forest in clear-cut stretches of land; this shows up clearly in aerial photos. The terrain that the <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> cross {{is for the}} most part not mountainous, but smooth and replete with lakes. Generally, four of the lines runs together in two pairs and the other two run solo, although the two single lines sometimes do run in a pair. Two intermediate 735kV <b>power</b> <b>lines,</b> one in the north and one in the south, connect all six <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> along their path to southern Quebec.|$|R
5|$|High winds {{across the}} state {{included}} a report of 47mph (76km/h) near the state's southeastern coastline. The winds downed some trees and resulted in power outages, and one person in Carrolwood was injured after a tree fell onto a house. The storm spawned several tornadoes in the southern portion of the state, some of which damaged fences and power lines. One possible tornado in Goulds left about 2,000people without power after it knocked down a <b>power</b> <b>line.</b> Another tornado near Miami damaged a few homes and trees.|$|E
5|$|Hydro-Québec TransÉnergie uses a {{combination}} of double-circuit three-level pylons and single-circuit delta pylons to suspend electrical conductors of other voltages, such as 315kV. The ±450kV high-voltage direct current line in Hydro-Québec's power grid uses a T-shaped tower, lattice or pole, to support two bundles of three conductors on each side. The direct current <b>power</b> <b>line</b> sometimes uses two poles or a wider, pyramidal, self-supporting lattice structure for angle towers.|$|E
5|$|It was {{recognized}} {{early on that}} SiC had such a voltage-dependent resistance, and so columns of SiC pellets were connected between high-voltage power lines and the earth. When a lightning strike to the line raises the line voltage sufficiently, the SiC column will conduct, allowing strike current to pass harmlessly to the earth instead of along the <b>power</b> <b>line.</b> Such SiC columns proved to conduct significantly at normal power-line operating voltages and thus had {{to be placed in}} series with a spark gap. This spark gap is ionized and rendered conductive when lightning raises the voltage of the <b>power</b> <b>line</b> conductor, thus effectively connecting the SiC column between the power conductor and the earth. Spark gaps used in lightning arresters are unreliable, either failing to strike an arc when needed or failing to turn off afterwards, in the latter case due to material failure or contamination by dust or salt. Usage of SiC columns was originally intended to eliminate the need for the spark gap in a lightning arrester. Gapped SiC lightning arresters were used as lightning-protection tool and sold under GE and Westinghouse brand names, among others. The gapped SiC arrester has been largely displaced by no-gap varistors that use columns of zinc oxide pellets.|$|E
