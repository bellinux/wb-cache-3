5|$|Doxorubicin is {{commonly}} used to treat some leukemias and Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as cancers of the bladder, breast, stomach, lung, ovaries, thyroid, soft tissue sarcoma, multiple myeloma, and others. Commonly used doxorubicin-containing regimens are AC (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide), TAC (taxotere, AC), ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine), BEACOPP, CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, <b>prednisone)</b> and FAC (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide).|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{worsening}} kidney damage {{would normally}} prompt a kidney biopsy. Treatment may be indicated {{on the basis}} of the appearance of the biopsy sample; various treatments may be used, ranging from oral steroids to a combination of intravenous methylprednisolone (steroid), cyclophosphamide and dipyridamole followed by <b>prednisone.</b> Other regimens include steroids/azathioprine, and steroids/cyclophosphamide (with or without heparin and warfarin). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is occasionally used.|$|E
5|$|Analgesics may {{be needed}} for the {{abdominal}} and joint pains. It is uncertain as to whether HSP needs treatment beyond controlling the symptoms. Most patients do not receive therapy {{because of the high}} spontaneous recovery rate. Steroids are generally avoided. However, if they are given early in the disease episode, the duration of symptoms may be shortened, and abdominal pain can improve significantly. Moreover, the chance of severe kidney problems may be reduced. A systematic review of randomized clinical trials did not find any evidence that steroid treatment (<b>prednisone)</b> is effective at decreasing the likelihood of developing long-term kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., <b>prednisone),</b> and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E
25|$|If oral Mesalazine {{is still}} not working, <b>prednisone</b> is often given, {{starting}} at 40–60mg/day. <b>Prednisone</b> often takes effect within 10–14 days. The dose should then be tapered by about 5mg/week until it can be stopped altogether.|$|E
25|$|T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is {{difficult}} to treat, {{and it does not}} respond to most available chemotherapeutic drugs. Many different treatments have been attempted, with limited success in certain patients: purine analogues (pentostatin, fludarabine, cladribine), chlorambucil, and various forms of combination chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, <b>prednisone</b> CHOP, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, <b>prednisone</b> , vincristine, doxorubicin, <b>prednisone,</b> etoposide, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin VAPEC-B). Alemtuzumab (Campath), a monoclonal antibody that attacks white blood cells, has been used in treatment with greater success than previous options.|$|E
25|$|Induction {{chemotherapy}} {{to bring}} about bone marrow remission. For adults, standard induction plans include <b>prednisone,</b> vincristine, and an anthracycline drug; other drug plans may include L-asparaginase or cyclophosphamide. For children with low-risk ALL, standard therapy usually consists of three drugs (<b>prednisone,</b> L-asparaginase, and vincristine) for {{the first month of}} treatment.|$|E
25|$|Systemic steroids such as <b>prednisone</b> are {{not used}} unless {{proctitis}} fails {{to respond to the}} above treatments.|$|E
25|$|Azathioprine is a steroid-sparing agent used in {{combination}} with <b>Prednisone.</b> It functions by inhibiting RNA and DNA synthesis.|$|E
25|$|In January 2013, Flaherty {{announced}} he had bullous pemphigoid. He {{was treated with}} <b>prednisone,</b> a corticosteroid with powerful known side effects.|$|E
25|$|In adrenal {{insufficiency}} and Addison's disease, dexamethasone is prescribed {{when the patient}} does not respond well to <b>prednisone</b> or methylprednisolone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prednisone</b> given with {{docetaxel}} led {{to improved}} survival, {{quality of life}} and pain management in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|Azathioprine is {{sometimes}} used in {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} patients who require a maintenance dose of 15mg or higher of <b>prednisone</b> and those who experience recurrent flares.|$|E
25|$|Corticosteroids such as <b>prednisone</b> improve {{recovery}} at 6 {{months and}} are thus recommended. Early treatment (within 3 days after the onset) is necessary for benefit with a 14% greater probability of recovery.|$|E
25|$|A {{widely used}} therapy for {{idiopathic}} pulmonary fibrosis was azathioprine in combination with <b>prednisone</b> and N-acetylcysteine. A 2012 study showed that there were worse outcomes with this combination than with placebo.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide {{is used as}} a {{first line}} {{treatment}} in multiple myeloma in combination with dexamethasone or with melphalan and <b>prednisone,</b> to treat acute episodes of erythema nodosum leprosum and for maintenance therapy.|$|E
25|$|Immunosuppressant steroids {{have been}} known to help slow the {{progression}} of Becker muscular dystrophy. The drug <b>prednisone</b> contributes to an increased production of the protein utrophin which closely resembles dystrophin, the protein that is defective in BMD.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{graft-versus-host disease}} {{typically}} {{occurs in the}} first 3 months after transplantation and may involve the skin, intestine, or the liver. High-dose corticosteroids such as <b>prednisone</b> are a standard treatment; however this immuno-suppressive treatment often leads to deadly infections.|$|E
25|$|Hydrocortisone, fludrocortisone, and <b>prednisone</b> were {{available}} by the late 1950s. By 1980 all of the relevant steroids could be measured in blood by reference laboratories for patient care. By 1990 nearly all specific genes and enzymes had been identified.|$|E
25|$|LGS {{seizures}} {{are often}} treatment resistant, {{but this does}} not mean that treatment is futile. Options include anticonvulsants, anesthetics, steroids such as <b>prednisone,</b> immunoglobulins, and various other pharmacological agents that have been reported to work in individual patients.|$|E
25|$|The cancer chemotherapic {{docetaxel}} {{has been}} used as treatment for CRPC with a median survival benefit of 2 to 3 months. A second-line chemotherapy treatment is cabazitaxel. A combination of bevacizumab, docetaxel, thalidomide and <b>prednisone</b> appears effective in the treatment of CRPC.|$|E
25|$|When eosinophilic {{pneumonia}} {{is related}} to an illness such as cancer or parasitic infection, treatment of the underlying cause is effective in resolving the lung disease. When due to AEP or CEP, however, treatment with corticosteroids results in a rapid, dramatic resolution of symptoms {{over the course of}} one or two days. Either intravenous methylprednisolone or oral <b>prednisone</b> are most commonly used. In AEP, treatment is usually continued for a month after symptoms disappear and the x-ray returns to normal (usually four weeks total). In CEP, treatment is usually continued for three months after symptoms disappear and the x-ray returns to normal (usually four months total). Inhaled steroids such as fluticasone have been used effectively when discontinuation of oral <b>prednisone</b> has resulted in relapse.|$|E
25|$|This {{approach}} {{was extended to}} the lymphomas in 1963 by Vincent T. DeVita and George Canellos at the NCI, who ultimately proved in the late 1960s that nitrogen mustard, vincristine, procarbazine and <b>prednisone</b> — known as the MOPP regimen — could cure patients with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{pediatric}} endocrinologists {{have tried}} to optimize growth by measuring a child every few months to assess current rate of growth, by checking the bone age every year or two, by periodically measuring 17OHP and testosterone levels as indicators of adrenal suppression, and by using hydrocortisone for glucocorticoid replacement rather than longer-acting <b>prednisone</b> or dexamethasone.|$|E
25|$|A {{urine sample}} {{provided}} by Tharanga {{after the world}} cup semi-final against New Zealand on 29 March 2011 {{was found to have}} metabolites of two glucocorticosteroids – <b>prednisone</b> and prednisolone, which are banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Tharanga initially claimed he had taken some medication for asthma and had no idea it was a banned drug.|$|E
25|$|For {{people with}} {{extended}} periods of cluster headaches, preventive therapy can be necessary. Verapamil is recommended as first line treatment. Lithium can also be useful. For people with shorter bouts, a short course of <b>prednisone</b> (10 days) can be helpful. Ergotamine is useful if given 1–2 hours before an attack. See cluster headaches for more detailed information.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the variety}} of {{symptoms}} and organ system involvement with SLE, its severity in an individual must be assessed in order to successfully treat SLE. Mild or remittent disease may, sometimes, be safely left untreated. If required, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antimalarials may be used. Medications such as <b>prednisone,</b> mycophenolic acid and tacrolimus {{have been used in}} the past.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide {{has been}} {{approved}} by the FDA for ENL and MM in combination with dexamethasone. EMA has also approved it to treat MM in combination with <b>prednisone</b> and/or melphalan. Orphan indications by the FDA include graft-versus-host disease, mycobacterial infection, recurrent aphthous ulcers, severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis, primary brain malignancies, HIV-associated wasting syndrome, Crohn's disease, Kaposi’s sarcoma, myelodysplastic syndrome and hematopoietic stem cell transplantantion.|$|E
25|$|Myasthenia gravis is {{generally}} treated with medications known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine. Immunosuppressants, such as <b>prednisone</b> or azathioprine, {{may also be}} used. The surgical removal of the thymus gland may improve symptoms in certain cases. Plasmapheresis and high dose intravenous immunoglobulin may be used during sudden flares of the condition. If the breathing muscles become significantly weak, mechanical ventilation may be required.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} prescribed oral steroid is <b>prednisone,</b> which is typically dosed at 0.5mg/kg for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Intravenous steroids, administered {{in a hospital}} setting, are used when oral steroids do not work or cannot be taken. Because corticosteroids reduce the body's ability to fight infection, {{care must be taken}} to ensure that there is no active infection, particularly an intra-abdominal abscess, before the initiation of steroids.|$|E
25|$|Steroid-induced {{osteoporosis}} (SIOP) arises due {{to use of}} glucocorticoids– {{analogous to}} Cushing's syndrome and involving mainly the axial skeleton. The synthetic glucocorticoid prescription drug <b>prednisone</b> is a main candidate after prolonged intake. Some professional guidelines recommend prophylaxis in patients who take the equivalent of more than 30mg hydrocortisone (7.5mg of prednisolone), especially when this is in excess of three months. Alternate day use may not prevent this complication.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prednisone</b> is an {{immunosuppressive}} agent which affects {{all of the}} organ systems. Effects on the cellular level include cell activation, replication, differentiation, and mobility. The overall goal is to decrease blistering (inhibition of immediate and delayed hypersensitivity) through decreasing the production of autoantibodies. In order to suppress the production of antibodies, higher doses must be administered. Lesser doses can be prescribed {{in order to achieve}} suppression of monocyte function.|$|E
25|$|Extensive or pancolitis. Patients usually {{require a}} {{combination}} of oral Mesalazine or sulfasalazine along with topical Mesalazine or steroid enemas. Oral <b>prednisone</b> (40–60mg/day) should be given only in severe cases or if oral Mesalazine fails. Once remission is induced, maintenance therapy is with standard oral Mesalazine doses. Supplemental iron (ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate) may be given due to chronic blood loss. Loperamide may be given for symptomatic relief of chronic diarrhea, but should not be given in suspected toxic megacolon.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy is the {{mainstay}} of treatment for lymphoma in cats. Most of the drugs used in dogs are used in cats, but the most common protocol uses cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and <b>prednisone.</b> Gastrointestinal lymphoma has also commonly been treated {{with a combination of}} prednisolone and high dose pulse chlorambucil with success. The white blood cell count must be monitored. Remission and survival times are comparable to dogs. Lower stage lymphoma has a better prognosis. Multicentric lymphoma has a better response to treatment than the gastrointestinal form, but infection with FeLV worsens the prognosis.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids are {{provided}} to all {{children and adults}} with all but the mildest and latest-onset forms of CAH. The glucocorticoids provide a reliable substitute for cortisol, thereby reducing ACTH levels. Reducing ACTH also reduces the stimulus for continued hyperplasia and overproduction of androgens. In other words, glucocorticoid replacement is the primary method of reducing the excessive adrenal androgen production in both sexes. A number of glucocorticoids are available for therapeutic use. Hydrocortisone or liquid prednisolone is preferred in infancy and childhood, and <b>prednisone</b> or dexamethasone are often more convenient for adults.|$|E
25|$|O'Rourke {{became ill}} in early 1987 and was misdiagnosed by doctors at Kaiser Permanente Hospital as having Crohn's disease. She was {{prescribed}} <b>prednisone</b> {{to treat the}} disease, which caused her cheeks to appear puffy and large. On January 31, 1988, O'Rourke suddenly became ill again, vomiting and unable to keep anything in her stomach. The next morning, she collapsed while preparing {{to leave for the}} hospital and her stepfather called paramedics. O'Rourke suffered a cardiac arrest en route to the hospital, and after resuscitation, she was airlifted by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where she died later that day.|$|E
