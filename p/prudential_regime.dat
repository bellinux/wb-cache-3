Next to credit institutions (i.e. banks) and certain authorities (e.g. central banks, government bodies), the PSD mentions Electronic Money Institutions, created by the E-Money Directive in 2000, and created the new category of 'Payment Institutions' with its own <b>prudential</b> <b>regime</b> rules.

As they are submitted to harmonised prudential regulation, and in consistency with the European Treaty (according to which any legal or natural person who is a citizen of a Union member State is free to establish him-, her- or itself, or to provide services, anywhere within the European Union), an insurer licensed in and regulated by e.g. the United Kingdom's financial services regulators, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, may establish a branch in, and/ or provide cross-border insurance coverage (through {{a process known as}} [...] "free provision of services") into, any other of the member States without being regulated by those States' regulators.

This new responsibility is embodied in the amendments made to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act and passed by Parliament in September 2008. The new regime requires non-bank deposit takers to comply with minimum prudential standards to be issued by the Reserve Bank. These standards will comprise the core <b>prudential</b> <b>regime</b> for the sector, and include credit rating, capital, and liquidity requirements, and restrictions on related party exposures. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model with credit {{frictions}} and a banking sector, which endogenizes loan-to-value (LTV) ratios of households and banks by expressing {{them as a}} function of systemic and idiosyncratic proxies for risk. Moreover, the model features endogenous balance sheet choices and a novel formulation of the targeted leverage ratio, in which assets are risk-weighted by risk-sensitivity measures. The results highlighted in this paper are important along two dimensions. First of all, the presence of endogenous LTV ratios exacerbates the procyclicality of lending conditions. Second, the model contributes to deeper understand the role of prudential regulatory frameworks in affecting business cycle fluctuations and in restoring macroeconomic and financial stability. The results suggest that when the economy is severely stressed by shocks originating in the financial sector, <b>prudential</b> <b>regimes</b> such as Basel II and Basel III are capable of downsizing substantially aggregate volatility, with Basel III found to be significantly more effective than Basel II...|$|R

Analyzing a panel data set of <b>prudential</b> supervision <b>regimes</b> in 98 countries over the period from 1999 to 2010, I find that central banks play a smaller role in supervision and tasks are more decentralized if the central bank is independent and transparent.

40|$|Banking, derivatives, and {{structured}} finance may attract the lion’s share of accolades and approbation in global finance—but payment systems are {{where the money}} is. Historically, payment systems in most jurisdictions have been legally and operationally intertwined with the conventional banking system. The stability of these systems has thus benefited from the unique <b>prudential</b> regulatory <b>regimes</b> imposed on deposit-taking banks. These regimes include deposit guarantee schemes, emergence liquidity assistance or ‘lender of last resort’ facilities, and special bankruptcy or ‘resolution’ processes for failing banks. These regimes have the practical effect of relaxing the strict application of corporate bankruptcy law, thereby enabling banks—and the payment systems embedded within them—to continue to perform their core payment and other functions under conditions of severe institutional stress. Recent years have witnessed {{the emergence of a}} vibrant, diverse, and rapidly growing shadow payment system. This system includes peer-to-peer payment systems such as PayPal, mobile money platforms such as M-Pesa, and crypto-currency exchanges such as Mt. Gox. The defining feature of this shadow payment system is that the financial institutions that populate it perform the same core payment functions as banks, but without benefiting from the <b>prudential</b> regulatory <b>regimes</b> that ensure bank-based payment systems can continue to function during periods of institutional stress free from the substantive and procedural constraints imposed by general corporate bankruptcy law. This paper examines the risks that the legal treatment of the shadow payment system poses to both customers and broader financial and economic stability, along with the likely effectiveness of various strategies that might be employed to address these risks. </p...|$|R
40|$|Insurers face {{a number}} of {{significant}} areas of risk in the operation of an insurance business. As well as pure insurance risk, there are credit risk, investment (or market) risk, liquidity risk and operational risks to consider. Financial weakness or failure of an insurer can have significant impacts on large numbers of policyholders of all descriptions. In order to properly protect policyholder interest, it is therefore clear that the financial strength of the insurance industry should be subject to appropriate prudential regulation. Until the enactment of the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act 2010 (the Act) in September, there had been no previous comprehensive <b>prudential</b> regulatory <b>regime</b> covering the activities of insurers carrying on insurance business in New Zealand. 1 Now the industry is subject to a world-class regulatory model administered by the Reserve Bank. This article explores the reasons behind the introduction of the new legislation, its objectives and the Reserve Bank’s intended approach in achieving these. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{non-bank}} {{deposit taking}} (NBDT) sector comprises building societies, credit unions and finance companies. NBDTs {{can play an}} important role in the economy, providing services complementary to those provided by banks. In recent years, many finance companies have failed, resulting in a significant loss of value in the sector. These failures have revealed weaknesses in the operating models of several finance companies, such as high levels of related party exposures and inadequate capitalisation relative to the risks taken. On 1 December 2010, NBDTs became subject to new regulatory requirements relating to capital adequacy, related party exposures, liquidity and governance. This represents a further step in the implementation of a new <b>prudential</b> regulatory <b>regime</b> administered by the Reserve Bank. Regulations setting out credit rating requirements came into force on 1 March 2010 and NBDTs have been required to have a risk management programme since September 2009. The new regulatory regime is aimed at promoting the soundness and efficiency of the financial system by setting minimum prudential standards that NBDTs must meet. The requirements have been modelled on the banking regime, but have been tailored so that they are fit for purpose for the NBDT sector. This article explains the requirements in force on 1 December 2010 and discusses the motivation for these requirements. ...|$|R
40|$|A new revised <b>prudential</b> {{regulatory}} <b>regime</b> for insurers will {{be introduced}} in order to align the South African insurance industry with international standards. This regime, called Solvency Assessment and Management, is based on its European counterpart, which is known as Solvency II. This study starts off by investigating and comparing Solvency II, to be implemented in the United Kingdom, with Solvency Assessment and Management, to be implemented in South Africa, identifying a number of similarities between the regimes. The taxation of long-term insurers in both jurisdictions is then investigated, but no similarities are identified. The above prepares the ground for {{the main purpose of}} the study, which is to identify the impact of Solvency Assessment and Management on the taxation of long-term insurers in South Africa. This study identified the impact as effecting a change in the current basis used for the valuation of policyholder liabilities, which will cause a decrease in the value of liabilities, and consequently an increase in underwriting profit. The impact of this change is illustrated, and there are clear indications {{that there is a need}} to amend current income tax legislation or the directive used to determine the value of liabilities. Two options for amendments are identified but no changes to legislation are expected before 2015. Dissertation (MCom) [...] University of Pretoria, 2014. lmchunu 2014 Taxationunrestricte...|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007 - 2009 reinvigorated academic and policymaking {{interest in the}} design of <b>prudential</b> regulatory <b>regimes</b> governing the financial sector as a policy instrument intended to moderate financial instability. The crisis also motivated interest in the role of taxation as a complement to these regimes. In practice, however, the use of tax instruments has been modest. This paper considers three tax instruments that could serve this complementary role. Political economy considerations aside, it is suggested that the use of bank leverage taxes as the tax instrument of choice is unsurprising. But as recognized in the literature, a corrective taxation case can be made for an increase in the rate of such taxes as an instrument to eliminate the availability of cheap debt for systemically important institutions. Although returns to risk taking is a potentially robust tax base, the weak behavioral properties of this tax instrument have apparently diminished its appeal for policymakers, while a revenue-raising imperative that might otherwise motivate its adoption is muted considerably by the adoption of a bank leverage tax. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, the tax literature does not consider the case for an excise tax on bonus and performance-based compensation as an instrument to alter the structure of compensation. This may be attributable, in part at least, to redundancy where regulatory regimes can be used to impose constraints with similar intended effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{extensive}} harm {{caused by}} the financial crisis {{raises the question of}} whether policymakers could have done more to prevent the build-up of financial imbalances. This paper aims to contribute to the field of regulatory impact assessment by taking up the revived debate on whether central banks should "lean against the wind" or not. Currently, there is no consensus on whether monetary policy is, in general, able to support the resilience of the financial system or if this task should better be left to the macroprudential approach of financial regulation. The author aims to shed light on this issue by analyzing distinct policy regimes within an agent-based computational macromodel with endogenous money. He finds that policies make use of their comparative advantage leading to superior outcomes concerning their respective intended objectives. In particular, he shows that "leaning against the wind" should only serve as first line of defense in the absence of a <b>prudential</b> regulatory <b>regime</b> and that price stability does not necessarily mean financial stability. Moreover, macroprudential regulation as unburdened policy instrument is able to dampen the build-up of financial imbalances by restricting credit to the unsustainable high-leveraged part of the real economy. In contrast, leaning against the wind seems to have no positive impact on financial stability which strengthens proponents of Tinbergen's principle arguing that both policies are designed for their specific purpose and that they should be used accordingly...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} market events in 2007 – 9 have spurred renewed interest and controversy in debates regarding financial regulation and supervision. This book takes {{stock of the}} developments in EU legislation, case-law and institutional structures with regards to banking regulation and supervision, which preceded and followed the recent financial crisis. It does not merely provide an update, but anchors these developments in the broader EU law context, challenging past paradigms and anticipating possible developments. The author provides a systematic analysis of the interactions between the content of prudential rules and the mechanisms behind their production and application. European Prudential Banking Regulation and Supervision includes discussions of the European banking market structure and of regulatory theory that both aim to circumscribe prudential concerns. It scrutinises the content of prudential norms, proposes a qualification of these norms and an assessment of their interaction {{with other types of}} norms (corporate, auditing and accounting, consumer protection, competition rules). It also features an analysis of the underpinning institutional set-up and its envisaged reforms, focusing on the typical EU concerns related to checks and balances. Finally, the book attempts to revive the debate on supervisory liability, in light of the developments discussed. This book will be of great value to all those interested in financial stability matters (practitioners, policy-makers, students, academics), as well as to EU law scholars. Introduction.

40|$|We {{provide one}} of the first {{attempts}} at explaining the differences in the crisis impact across developing countries and emerging markets. Using cross-country regressions to explain the factors driving growth forecast revisions after the eruption of the global crisis, we find that a small set of variables explain a large share of the variation in growth revisions. Countries with more leveraged domestic financial systems and more rapid credit growth tended to suffer larger downward revisions to their growth outlooks. For emerging markets, this financial channel trumps the trade channel. For a broader set of developing countries, however, the trade channel seems to have mattered, with countries exporting more advanced manufacturing goods more affected than those exporting food. Exchange-rate flexibility clearly helped in buffering the impact of the shock. There is also some -weaker-evidence that countries with a stronger fiscal position prior to the crisis were hit less severely. We find little evidence for the importance of other policy variables.
