5|$|Calhoun {{died at the}} Old Brick Capitol {{boarding}} house in Washington, D.C., on March 31, 1850, of tuberculosis, {{at the age of}} 68. He was interred at the St. Philip's Churchyard in Charleston, South Carolina. During the Civil War, a group of Calhoun's friends were concerned about the possible desecration of his grave by Federal troops and, during the night, removed his coffin to a hiding <b>place</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> stairs of the church. The next night, his coffin was buried in an unmarked grave near the church, where it remained until 1871, when it was again exhumed and returned to its original place.|$|E

5|$|On 18 August, {{a general}} advance began and the {{following}} morning No. 6 Commando took part in an attack to seize an area of high ground {{to the east of}} the Dives, north of Dozule. The attack took <b>place</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> cover of darkness and the lead elements were able to infiltrate deep into the German positions before they were detected. By daybreak the position had been captured and {{over the course of the}} day four determined counter-attacks were repelled. In one attack, a troop from No. 6 Commando rushed their attackers, killing the senior German officer and capturing 25 prisoners as the attack was broken up.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{dispute about}} whether this new {{military}} structure was put into <b>place</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Emperor Diocletian or Constantine since both reorganised the Roman Army in the late 3rd and early 4th centuries to some degree. Both Diocletian and even his predecessor of thirty years Gallienus may already have controlled mobile strategic reserves to assist the empire's border forces; either Diocletian or Constantine expanded this nascent force into permanent field armies.|$|E
50|$|If play {{goes to a}} standstill, {{the player}} picks out an exiled card and looks {{to see if it}} can be placed on the foundations.

The top card of that pile is then picked up and <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> pile corresponding to its rank. This continues until a playable card is uncovered with the last card picked up <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> appropriate pile. Play resumes as normal.|$|R
50|$|The National Archives also {{experienced}} many administrative changes over the years. From its beginnings at the Office of the Prime Minister, the National Archives was <b>placed</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Ministry of Education in 1982.

5|$|Thus, the Samaritans rebelled again {{under the}} rule of emperor Anastasius I, reoccupying Mount Gerizim, which was {{subsequently}} reconquered by the Byzantine governor of Edessa, Procopius. A third Samartian revolt which took <b>place</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> leadership of Julianus ben Sabar in 529 was perhaps the most violent. Neapolis' bishop Ammonas was murdered and the city's priests were hacked into pieces and then burned together with the relics of saints. The forces of Emperor Justinian I were sent in to quell the revolt, which ended with the slaughter {{of the majority of the}} Samaritan population in the city.|$|E
5|$|After the {{construction}} was complete {{there was no}} further room for expansion at Les Corts. Back-to-back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 and the signing of László Kubala in June 1950, who would later go on to score 196 goals in 256 matches, drew larger crowds to the games. The club began to make {{plans for a new}} stadium. The building of Camp Nou commenced on 28 March 1954, before a crowd of 60,000 Barça fans. The first stone of the future stadium was laid in <b>place</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> auspices of Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego. Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288 million pesetas, 336% over budget.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the BIPM had custody of two artefacts – one to define length and the other to define mass. Other units of measure which did not rely on specific artefacts were controlled by other bodies. In the scientific world, quantum theory was in its infancy and Einstein had yet to publish his theories of relativity. By the end of the century, a coherent system of units was in <b>place</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> control of the bodies set up by the Convention du Mètre (Metre Convention), the definition of the second relied on quantum theory, the definition of the metre relied on the theory of relativity, and plans were being made to relegate the international prototype kilogram to the archives.|$|E

5|$|During the deportations, {{he tried}} to secure more work permits from the Germans but they refused to issue them. He {{attempted}} to protect those he could. During the Aktion on 3–5 November, in which the paperwork of everyone in the ghetto was checked, holders of work passes– which allowed the holder to protect a spouse and only two children under 16– were checked and anyone not listed on someone's work permit was sent to Ponary. At one point, while Gens was checking permits, a family with three children went through the checkpoint, and Gens pulled aside the third child. Shortly afterwards, a family with only one child passed through the checkpoint. Gens began berating the father for losing track of his second child, and pushed the third child from the first family into the second family. This incident took <b>place</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> supervision of German officials, who did not intervene.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} hours of 1 May, Krebs talked to General Chuikov, {{commander}} of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, informing him of Hitler's death and a willingness to negotiate a citywide surrender. They could not agree on terms because of Soviet insistence on unconditional surrender and Krebs' claim that he lacked authorisation to agree to that. Goebbels was against surrender. In the afternoon, Goebbels and his wife killed their children and then themselves. Goebbels's death removed the last impediment which prevented Weidling from accepting the terms of unconditional surrender of his garrison, but he chose to delay the surrender until the next morning to allow the planned breakout to take <b>place</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> cover of darkness.|$|E
5|$|Freemasons, {{members of}} a European fraternal {{organization}} that attained its modern form in the early eighteenth century, developed many pseudohistorical origin myths that traced Freemasonry back to ancient times. Egypt was among the civilizations that Masons claimed had influenced their traditions. After Sethos was published, several Masonic lodges developed rites based on those in the novel. Late in the century, Masonic writers, still assuming that Sethos was an ancient story, used the obvious resemblance between their rites and the initiation of Sethos as evidence of Freemasonry's supposedly ancient origin. Many works of fiction from the 1790s to the 1820s reused and modified the signature traits of Terrasson's Egyptian initiation: trials by three or four elements, often taking <b>place</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> pyramids. The best-known of these works is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's 1791 opera The Magic Flute, in which the main character, Tamino, undergoes a series of trials overseen by priests who invoke Isis and Osiris.|$|E

5|$|Further {{excavations}} {{were carried}} out by Louis Salzmann between 1906 and 1908, concentrating on the north-west sector of the Roman fort, the east gate and the north postern. Harry Sands undertook the clearing of debris around the medieval castle keep in 1906 and more extensive excavations in 1910. Further clearing work took <b>place</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> supervision of the Ministry of Works in 1926 following the acquisition of the castle by the state. In 1936 Frank Cottrill carried out an eight-month excavation {{in the area of}} the outer bailey. B. W. Pearce excavated outside the Roman west gate in 1938 and cleared the moat of debris the following year. The Second World War ended any further work, and it was not until 1964 that limited exploration by Stuart Rigold took place outside the south-east postern of the inner bailey. In 1993–95, a team from the University of Reading led by Professor Michael Fulford carried out a series of excavations {{in the area of the}} keep and on the Roman fortress's east side.|$|E
5|$|Monotype's {{development}} of Ehrhardt took <b>place</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> influence of executive and historian of printing Stanley Morison, {{not long after}} their successful creation of Times New Roman. It began from a recognition that the Janson designs were well-respected by fine printers of the Arts and Crafts period such as Daniel Berkeley Updike, who could print books from them using hand-set type cast from surviving original matrices owned by the Stempel company of Germany. Morison had discussed what he knew of their history with Updike in their extensive correspondence from the 1920s onwards. Modernised versions of the Janson designs for hot metal printing were being created by Linotype and Monotype's American branch at the same time. In addition, Morison {{was interested in the}} history of printing in Leipzig, a centre of the German book trade, and would later write an article on the topic.|$|E
5|$|Queen Mary, {{along with}} the other Jutland wrecks, has been {{declared}} a protected <b>place</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 to discourage further damage to the resting place of 1,266 officers and men. Surveys of this site conducted by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney in 2001–03 have shown the wreck is in three sections, with the two forward sections being heavily damaged and in pieces. Her aft end is upside down and relatively complete except for her propellers, which have been salvaged. Examination of the damage to the ship has suggested that the initial explosion was not in the magazine of 'A' or 'B' forward main turrets, but instead in the magazine of the forward 4-inch battery. An explosion of the quantity of cordite in the main magazine would have been sufficient to also ignite 'Q' magazine, destroying much more of the ship. The explosion in the smaller magazine would have been sufficient to break the ship in two, the blast then spreading to the forward magazine and ripping apart the forward section.|$|E
