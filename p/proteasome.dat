Lactacystin covalently modifies the amino-terminal threonine of catalytic β subunits of the <b>proteasome,</b> particularly the β5 subunit responsible for the proteasome's chymotrypsin-like activity. This discovery helped to establish the <b>proteasome</b> as a mechanistically novel class of protease: an amino-terminal threonine protease.|$|E
40|$|Background: 20 S <b>proteasomes,</b> the {{proteolytic}} core par-ticles of {{the major}} intracellular protein degradative pathway, are potential disease markers because they are detectable in human plasma as circulating <b>proteasomes</b> and their concentrations are increased in patients suf-fering from various diseases. To investigate the origin of circulating <b>proteasomes,</b> we compared some of their features with those of <b>proteasomes</b> isolated from major blood cells.

40|$|Wild-type <b>proteasomes</b> {{of human}} {{erythrocytes}} and the archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum compete {{with each other}} for transport into nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells in the presence of an energy-regenerating system and rabbit reticulocyte lysate. 'NLS'-mutated Thermoplasma <b>proteasomes</b> were also able to compete with human <b>proteasomes</b> in the same assay, although with lower efficiency. Furthermore, in contrast to the other archaeal and bacterial cell lysates tested, the Thermoplasma cytosol efficiently supported nuclear import of human and Thermoplasma <b>proteasomes.</b> However, the same lysate could barely direct the nuclear transport of BSA-NLSSV 40 peptide conjugates or the classical NLS-bearing protein, nucleoplasmin. Finally, additional importin alpha/beta significantly decreased the import efficiency of both human and Thermoplasma <b>proteasomes.</b> Taken together, these results suggest that nuclear import of <b>proteasomes</b> may use a novel pathway that is different from that of classical NLS-bearing proteins.

40|$|SummaryThe {{processing}} of propeptides and the maturation of 20 S <b>proteasomes</b> require {{the association of}} β rings from two half <b>proteasomes.</b> We propose an assembly-dependent activation model in which interactions between helix (H 3 and H 4) residues of the opposing half <b>proteasomes</b> are prerequisite for appropriate positioning of the S 2 -S 3 loop; such positioning enables correct coordination of the active-site residue needed for propeptide cleavage. Mutations of H 3 or H 4 residues that participate in the association of two half <b>proteasomes</b> inhibit activation and prevent, in nearly all cases, the formation of full <b>proteasomes.</b> In contrast, mutations affecting interactions with residues of the S 2 -S 3 loop allow the assembly of full, but activity impacted, <b>proteasomes.</b> The crystal structure of the inactive H 3 mutant, Phe 145 Ala, shows that the S 2 -S 3 loop is displaced from the position observed in wild-type <b>proteasomes.</b> These data support the proposed assembly-dependent activation model in which the S 2 -S 3 loop acts as an activation switch...|$|R
5|$|<b>Proteasome</b> inhibitors {{have also}} shown promise in {{treating}} autoimmune diseases in animal models.

5|$|The 20S <b>proteasome</b> is both {{ubiquitous}} {{and essential}} in eukaryotes. Some prokaryotes, including many archaea and the bacterial order Actinomycetales also share homologs of the 20S <b>proteasome,</b> whereas most bacteria possess heat shock genes hslV and hslU, whose gene products are a multimeric protease {{arranged in a}} two-layered ring and an ATPase. The hslV protein has been hypothesized to resemble the likely ancestor of the 20S <b>proteasome.</b> In general, HslV is not essential in bacteria, and not all bacteria possess it, whereas some protists possess both the 20S and the hslV systems. Many bacteria also possess other homologs of the <b>proteasome</b> and an associated ATPase, most notably ClpP and ClpX. This redundancy explains why the HslUV system is not essential.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which a polyubiquitinated protein is targeted to the <b>proteasome</b> is not fully understood. Ubiquitin-receptor proteins have an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and one or more ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains. The UBL domains are recognized by the 19S <b>proteasome</b> caps and the UBA domains bind ubiquitin via three-helix bundles. These receptor proteins may escort polyubiquitinated proteins to the <b>proteasome,</b> though the specifics of this interaction and its regulation are unclear.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe role of <b>proteasomes,</b> {{particles}} with latent multicatalytic proteinase, in ATP-dependent proteolysis in rat reticulocyte extracts was examined. Removal of <b>proteasomes</b> {{from the}} extracts by immunoprecipitation caused almost complete inhibition of ATP-dependent degradation of [3 H]methylcasein, without affecting ATP-independent proteolysis. Peptide fragments of [3 H]casein, obtained by cyanogen bromide cleavage, were rapidly degraded in an ATP-independent fashion and this activity was {{not affected by}} removal of the <b>proteasomes.</b> These results suggest that <b>proteasomes</b> are involved in ATP-dependent proteolysis in the extracts and that they catalyze the initial cleavage of large proteins...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe autophagic {{clearance}} of 26 S <b>proteasomes</b> (proteaphagy) is {{an important}} homeostatic mechanism within the ubiquitin system that modulates proteolytic capacity and eliminates damaged particles. Here, we define two proteaphagy routes in yeast that respond to either nitrogen starvation or particle inactivation. Whereas the core autophagic machineries required for Atg 8 lipidation and vesiculation are essential for both routes, the upstream Atg 1 kinase participates only in starvation-induced proteaphagy. Following inactivation, 26 S <b>proteasomes</b> become extensively modified with ubiquitin. Although prior studies with Arabidopsis implicated RPN 10 in tethering ubiquitylated <b>proteasomes</b> to ATG 8 lining the autophagic membranes, yeast proteaphagy employs the evolutionarily distinct receptor Cue 5, which simultaneously binds ubiquitin and Atg 8. Proteaphagy of inactivated <b>proteasomes</b> also requires the oligomeric Hsp 42 chaperone, suggesting that ubiquitylated <b>proteasomes</b> are directed by Hsp 42 to insoluble protein deposit (IPOD) -type structures before encapsulation. Together, Cue 5 and Hsp 42 provide a quality control checkpoint in yeast directed at recycling dysfunctional 26 S <b>proteasomes...</b>|$|R

5|$|The <b>proteasome</b> is also {{involved}} in Intracellular antibody-mediated proteolysis of antibody-bound virions.

5|$|Dysregulation of the {{ubiquitin}} <b>proteasome</b> {{system may}} contribute to several neural diseases. It may lead to brain tumors such as astrocytomas. In some of the late-onset neurodegenerative diseases that share aggregation of misfolded proteins as a common feature, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, large insoluble aggregates of misfolded proteins can form and then result in neurotoxicity, through mechanisms that are not yet well understood. Decreased <b>proteasome</b> activity has been suggested {{as a cause of}} aggregation and Lewy body formation in Parkinson's. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that yeast models of Parkinson's are more susceptible to toxicity from α-synuclein, the major protein component of Lewy bodies, under conditions of low <b>proteasome</b> activity. Impaired proteasomal activity may underlie cognitive disorders such as the autism spectrum disorders, and muscle and nerve diseases such as inclusion body myopathy.|$|E
40|$|<b>Proteasomes,</b> {{also known}} as multicatalytic proteinase complexes, were {{localized}} in suspension cells of potato (Solanum tuberosum) by direct immunofluorescence using polyclonal antibodies labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. The method used allows an estimate of relative amounts of proteasomal antigens in different cell components. <b>Proteasomes</b> {{are present in the}} nuclei and the cytoplasm. The nucleoplasm contains small areas of weak fluorescence. The peripheral cytoplasm and possibly elements of the cytoskeleton show higher fluorescence than other parts of the cytoplasm.

40|$|Class I major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) molecules present antigenic peptides of cytoplasmic origin to T cells. As the lengths of these peptides seem restricted to eight or nine amino acids, an unusual proteolytic system must {{play a role in}} antigen processing. <b>Proteasomes,</b> a major extralysosomal proteolytic system, are responsible for the degradation of cytoplasmic proteins. We demonstrate that several proteasomal subunits, including MHC-encoded subunits, are regulated by interferon gamma. These data and the finding that MHC-encoded and other interferon gamma-regulated proteasomal subunits are uniquely associated with <b>proteasomes</b> strongly suggest that the immune system has recruited <b>proteasomes</b> for antigen processing...|$|R

5|$|Labeling and {{inhibition}} of the <b>proteasome</b> is also {{of interest in}} laboratory settings for both in vitro and in vivo study of proteasomal activity in cells. The most commonly used laboratory inhibitors are lactacystin and the peptide aldehyde MG132 initially developed by Goldberg lab. Fluorescent inhibitors have also been developed to specifically label the active sites of the assembled <b>proteasome.</b>|$|E
5|$|Recently an {{alternative}} <b>proteasome</b> was identified in human cells that lack the α3 core subunit. These proteasomes (known as the α4-α4 proteasomes) instead form 20S core particles containing an additional α4 subunit {{in place of}} the missing α3 subunit. Interestingly, these alternative 'α4-α4' proteasomes have been known previously to exist in yeast. Although the precise function of these <b>proteasome</b> isoforms is still largely unknown, cells expressing these proteasomes show enhanced resistance to toxicity induced by metallic ions such as cadmium.|$|E
5|$|The <b>proteasome</b> {{subcomponents}} {{are often}} referred to by their Svedberg sedimentation coefficient (denoted S). The <b>proteasome</b> most exclusively used in mammals is the cytosolic 26S <b>proteasome,</b> which is about 2000 kilodaltons (kDa) in molecular mass containing one 20S protein subunit and two 19S regulatory cap subunits. The core is hollow and provides an enclosed cavity in which proteins are degraded; openings at the two ends of the core allow the target protein to enter. Each end of the core particle associates with a 19S regulatory subunit that contains multiple ATPase active sites and ubiquitin binding sites; it is this structure that recognizes polyubiquitinated proteins and transfers them to the catalytic core. An alternative form of regulatory subunit called the 11S particle can associate with the core in essentially {{the same manner as}} the 19S particle; the 11S {{may play a role in}} degradation of foreign peptides such as those produced after infection by a virus.|$|E
40|$|<b>Proteasomes</b> are {{responsible}} for generating peptides presented by the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules of the immune system. Here, we report the identification of a previously unrecognized catalytic subunit called b 5 t. b 5 t is expressed exclusively in cortical thymic epithelial cells, which {{are responsible}} for the positive selection of developing thymocytes. Although the chymotrypsin-like activity of <b>proteasomes</b> is considered to be important for the production of peptides with high affinities for MHC class I clefts, incorporation of b 5 t into <b>proteasomes</b> in place of b 5 or b 5 i selectively reduces this activity. We also found that b 5 t-deficient mice displayed defective development of CD 8 + T cells in the thymus. Our results suggest a key role for b 5 t in generating the MHC class I–restricted CD 8 + T cell repertoire during thymic selection. <b>Proteasomes</b> are multicatalytic proteinasecomplexes that {{are responsible for}} regu-lated proteolysis in eukaryotic cells and essential for the generation of antigenic peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules of the immune system in jawed vertebrates (1).

40|$|AbstractApoptosis can be {{initiated}} in immortalized cAMP-stimulated rat ovarian granulosa cells by induction of wild-type p 53 activity. Immunocytochemical studies using confocal microscopy reveal that in apoptotic, unlike in normal growing cells, the <b>proteasomes</b> {{are removed from}} the nucleus and accumulate within the apoptotic blebs at {{the periphery of the}} cell. In parallel, a striking reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is observed which forms a spherical network separating the apoptotic blebs from the cytoplasmic organelles, such as mitochondria and lipid droplets which remain in the perinuclear region. The reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton as well as disappearance of <b>proteasomes</b> from the nucleus suggest possible function of <b>proteasomes</b> in apoptotic regulation...|$|R
5|$|Although most proteasomal {{substrates}} must be ubiquitinated {{before being}} degraded, {{there are some}} exceptions to this general rule, especially when the <b>proteasome</b> plays a normal role in the post-translational processing of the protein. The proteasomal activation of NF-κB by processing p105 into p50 via internal proteolysis is one major example. Some proteins that are hypothesized to be unstable due to intrinsically unstructured regions, are degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner. The most well-known example of a ubiquitin-independent <b>proteasome</b> substrate is the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase. Ubiquitin-independent mechanisms targeting key cell cycle regulators such as p53 have also been reported, although p53 is also subject to ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Finally, structurally abnormal, misfolded, or highly oxidized proteins are also subject to ubiquitin-independent and 19S-independent degradation under conditions of cellular stress.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>proteasome</b> {{normally}} produces {{very short}} peptide fragments, {{in some cases}} these products are themselves biologically active and functional molecules. Certain transcription factors regulating the expression of specific genes, including one component of the mammalian complex NF-κB, are synthesized as inactive precursors whose ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation converts them to an active form. Such activity requires the <b>proteasome</b> to cleave the substrate protein internally, rather than processively degrading it from one terminus. It {{has been suggested that}} long loops on these proteins' surfaces serve as the proteasomal substrates and enter the central cavity, while the majority of the protein remains outside. Similar effects have been observed in yeast proteins; this mechanism of selective degradation is known as regulated ubiquitin/proteasome dependent processing (RUP).|$|E
5|$|Both {{internal}} and external signals {{can lead to the}} induction of apoptosis, or programmed cell death. The resulting deconstruction of cellular components is primarily carried out by specialized proteases known as caspases, but the <b>proteasome</b> also plays important and diverse roles in the apoptotic process. The involvement of the <b>proteasome</b> in this process is indicated by both the increase in protein ubiquitination, and of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes that is observed well in advance of apoptosis. During apoptosis, proteasomes localized to the nucleus have also been observed to translocate to outer membrane blebs characteristic of apoptosis.|$|E
40|$|A frame-shift {{mutation}} in {{the transcript of}} the ubiquitin-B gene leads to a C-terminally extended ubiquitin, UBB+ 1. UBB+ 1 has been considered to inhibit <b>proteasomes,</b> and as such to be the underlying cause for toxic protein buildup correlated with certain neuropathological conditions. We demonstrated that expression of extended ubiquitin variants led to accumulation of heterogeneously-linked polyubiquitin conjugates indicating a pervasive effect on ubiquitin-dependent turnover. 20 S <b>proteasomes</b> selectively proteolysed ubiquitin extensions, yet no evidence for inhibition of 26 S holoenzymes was found. However, among susceptible targets for inhibition was Ubp 6, the primary enzyme responsible for disassembly of lysine- 48 linkages at 26 S <b>proteasomes.</b> Processing of lysine- 48 and lysine- 63 linkages by other deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) was also inhibited. Disruption of ubiquitin-dependent degradation by extended ubiquitin variants may therefore be attributed to their inhibitory effect on select DUBs, thus shifting research efforts related to protein accumulation in neurodegenerative processes from <b>proteasomes</b> to DUBs...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{degradation}} is {{an essential}} and highly regulated process. The proteasomal degradation of the tumor suppressors p 53 and p 73 is regulated by both polyubiquitination and by an ubiquitin-independent process. Here, we show that this ubiquitin-independent process is mediated by the 20 S <b>proteasomes</b> and is regulated by NQO 1. NQO 1 physically interacts with p 53 and p 73 in an NADH-dependent manner and protects them from 20 S proteasomal degradation. Remarkably, {{the vast majority of}} NQO 1 in cells is found in physical association with the 20 S <b>proteasomes,</b> suggesting that NQO 1 functions as a gatekeeper of the 20 S <b>proteasomes.</b> We further show that this pathway plays a role in p 53 accumulation in response to ionizing radiation. Our findings provide the first evidence for in vivo degradation of p 53 and p 73 by the 20 S <b>proteasomes</b> and its regulation by NQO 1 and NADH level...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{turnover}} and homeostasis {{are regulated}} by the proteasomal system, which is critical for cell function and viability. Pluripotency of stem cells also relies on normal proteasomal activity that mitigates senescent phenotypes induced by intensive cell replications, as previously demonstrated in human bone marrow stromal cells. In this study, we investigated the role of <b>proteasomes</b> in self-renewal of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Through both in vivo and in vitro analyses, {{we found that the}} expression of <b>proteasomes</b> was progressively decreased during aging. Likewise, proliferation and self-renewal of NPCs were also impaired in aged mice, suggesting that the down-regulation of <b>proteasomes</b> might be responsible for this senescent phenotype. Lowering proteasomal activity by loss-of-function manipulations mimicked the senescence of NPCs both in vitro and in vivo; conversely, enhancing proteasomal activity restored and improved self-renewal in aged NPCs. These results collectively indicate that <b>proteasomes</b> work as a key regulator in promoting self-renewal of NPCs. This potentially provides a promising therapeutic target for age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases...|$|R
5|$|Due to {{its role}} in {{generating}} the activated form of NF-κB, an anti-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory regulator of cytokine expression, proteasomal activity {{has been linked to}} inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Increased levels of <b>proteasome</b> activity correlate with disease activity and have been implicated in autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
5|$|In archaea such as Thermoplasma acidophilum, all the α {{and all the}} β {{subunits}} are identical, whereas eukaryotic proteasomes such {{as those}} in yeast contain seven distinct types of each subunit. In mammals, the β1, β2, and β5 subunits are catalytic; although they share a common mechanism, they have three distinct substrate specificities considered chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing (PHGH). Alternative β forms denoted β1i, β2i, and β5i can be expressed in hematopoietic cells in response to exposure to pro-inflammatory signals such as cytokines, in particular, interferon gamma. The <b>proteasome</b> assembled with these alternative subunits is known as the immunoproteasome, whose substrate specificity is altered relative to the normal <b>proteasome.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{partitioning}} {{of cellular}} components between the nucleus and cytoplasm is the defining feature of eukaryotic life.

By leveraging in situ cryo-electron tomography to image the native cellular environment of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we observed that nuclear 26 S <b>proteasomes</b> crowd around NPCs. Through a combination of subtomogram averaging and nanometer-precision localization, we identified two classes of <b>proteasomes</b> tethered via their Rpn 9 subunits to two specific NPC locations: binding sites on the NPC basket that reflect its eightfold symmetry and more abundant binding sites at the inner nuclear membrane that encircle the NPC.

40|$|SummaryHistone {{acetylation}} plays critical {{roles in}} chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, and epigenetic regulation of gene expression, but {{the underlying mechanisms}} are unclear. <b>Proteasomes</b> usually catalyze ATP- and polyubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Here, we show that the <b>proteasomes</b> containing the activator PA 200 catalyze the polyubiquitin-independent degradation of histones. Most <b>proteasomes</b> in mammalian testes (“spermatoproteasomes”) contain a spermatid/sperm-specific α subunit α 4 s/PSMA 8 and/or the catalytic β subunits of immunoproteasomes in addition to PA 200. Deletion of PA 200 in mice abolishes acetylation-dependent degradation of somatic core histones during DNA double-strand breaks and delays core histone disappearance in elongated spermatids. Purified PA 200 greatly promotes ATP-independent proteasomal degradation of the acetylated core histones, but not polyubiquitinated proteins. Furthermore, acetylation on histones is required for their binding to the bromodomain-like regions in PA 200 and its yeast ortholog, Blm 10. Thus, PA 200 /Blm 10 specifically targets the core histones for acetylation-mediated degradation by <b>proteasomes,</b> providing mechanisms by which acetylation regulates histone degradation, DNA repair, and spermatogenesis...|$|R

Nuclear localization signal (NLS) type sequences were identified in <b>proteasomes</b> from various organisms, In addition, acidic complementary sequences were identified (cNLS) which could interact with the positively charged NLS, masking or unmasking them and thereby modulating nuclear import. In this paper we show that fluorescently labeled human erythrocyte 20 S <b>proteasomes</b> accumulate in the nucleus of digitonin-permeabilized cells. This translocation is ATP-dependent and occurs through the nuclear pore complex as is shown by blocking of the nuclear pores with wheat germ agglutinin. In addition, we used 20 S <b>proteasomes</b> from Thermoplasma acidophilum as a model system. Recombinant 20 S <b>proteasomes</b> from the archaebacterium Thermoplasma acidophilum are imported into nuclei of HeLa and 3 T 3 cells similar to their eukaryotic counterpart.
