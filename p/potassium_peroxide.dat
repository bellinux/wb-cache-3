5|$|Potassium is an {{extremely}} active metal that reacts violently with oxygen in water and air. With oxygen it forms <b>potassium</b> <b>peroxide,</b> and with water potassium forms potassium hydroxide. The reaction of potassium with water is dangerous because of its violent exothermic character {{and the production of}} hydrogen gas. Hydrogen reacts again with atmospheric oxygen, producing water, which reacts with the remaining potassium. This reaction requires only traces of water; because of this, potassium and the liquid sodium-potassium — NaK — are potent desiccants {{that can be used to}} dry solvents prior to distillation.|$|E

40|$|Potassium {{hydroxide}} {{was subjected}} to the products of an electrical discharge sustained in oxygen and produced both <b>potassium</b> <b>peroxide</b> and superoxide. The conversion to higher oxides was shown to strongly depend upon the particle size of KOH, the position of KOH in the discharge zone, and the operating conditions of the discharge.

The yields of peroxides were shown to strongly depend upon the operating conditions of the discharge. The absence of superoxides {{and the presence of}} peroxides of lithium and calcium was explained from the consideration of relative thermodynamic stability of the oxides of lithium and calcium.

40|$|Recent {{researches}} in {{thermal energy}} harvesting have revealed the remarkable efficiency of thermionic energy converters comprising very low work function electrodes. From room temperature and above, {{this kind of}} converter could supply low power devices such as autonomous sensor networks. In this type of thermoelectric converters, current injection is mainly governed by a mechanism of thermionic emission at the hot electrode which explains the interest for low work function coating materials. In particular, alkali metal oxides {{have been identified as}} excellent candidates for coating converter electrodes. This paper is devoted to the synthesis and characterization of <b>potassium</b> <b>peroxide</b> K 2 O 2 onto silicon surfaces. To determine optimal synthesis conditions of K 2 O 2, we present diagrams showing the different oxides as a function of temperature and oxygen pressure from which phase stability characteristics can be determined. From the experimental standpoint, we present results on the synthesis of potassium oxide under ultra high vacuum and controlled temperature. The resulting surface is characterized in situ by means of photoemission spectroscopy (PES) and contact potential difference (CPD) measurements. A work function of 1. 35 [*]eV is measured which and the expected efficiency of the corresponding converter is discussed. It is generally assumed that the decrease of the work function in the alkali/oxygen/silicon system, is attributed {{to the creation of a}} surface dipole resulting from a charge transfer between the alkali metal and oxygen...|$|E

40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{and reaction}} of various simple molecules (O 2, NO, CO and NO 2) {{commonly associated with}} gasoline engine exhaust catalysis were investigated on a model catalytic system under ultra-high vacuum conditions {{using a variety of}} surface science techniques including molecular beam scattering and temperature programmed desorption. The model catalytic surfaces studied were clean Pt(111), K/Pt(111) and BaO/Pt(111) surfaces. The alkaline and alkaline earth metal surfaces were prepared by metal vapour deposition (in an oxygen background in the case of BaO) and annealing. Also investigated was the ability of each of the catalytic surfaces to oxidise NO and CO and to store and reduce NO 2. It was found that the clean Pt(111) surface was effective at oxidising CO provided the oxygen was in an adsorbed atomic form. Pt(111) was also found to be effective in the reduction of NO 2. NO and O 2 were found to react in a gas phase reaction that made mixed molecular beam studies problematic however it was found when beaming NO with a background pressure of O 2 that no Pt(111) catalysed surface reaction was observed. It was found that dosing K onto the Pt(111) surface increased the sticking coefficient of oxygen greatly and that more than a monolayer of K on the surface catalysed the reduction of NO to N 2. Unlike the Pt(111) surface, K/Pt(111) was capable of storing NO 2 without it being immediately reduced. <b>Potassium</b> <b>peroxide</b> however was found to prevent NO 2 storage. In a similar fashion to K, NO 2 was stored on BaO, being released as NO and O 2 on heating. NO is partially reduced to N 2 O by the BaO surface at ambient temperature with increased temperature favouring complete reduction to N 2...|$|E
40|$|Aim : The {{aim of this}} ex vivo {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} the effect of in-office bleaching agents,- 35 % and 38 % hydrogen peroxide containing bleaching agents, on the phosphate concentration of the enamel evaluated by Raman spectroscopy. Materials and Methods : Forty noncarious, craze-free human maxillary incisors, extracted for periodontal reasons, were used in this study. Baseline Raman spectra from each specimen were obtained before {{the application of the}} bleaching agent to assess the phosphate content present in the teeth. The teeth were divided into two groups: Group A - bleached with pola office bleach (35 % hydrogen <b>peroxide,</b> <b>potassium</b> nitrate) (light activated). Group B - bleached with opalescence Xtra bleach (38 % hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> <b>potassium</b> nitrate and fluoride) (chemical activated). After the bleaching procedure, the treated specimens were taken to obtain Raman spectra to assess the phosphate loss after bleaching treatment. Results : The results showed that the chemically activated bleaching agent showed less phosphate loss when compared with the light activated bleaching agent. Conclusion : Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that the chemically activated bleaching agent showed minimal phosphate loss when compared to light activated bleaching agent. The chemically activated bleaching agent was better than the light activated bleaching agent when values were evaluated statistically...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidation}} state of four transition metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, and Cr) in cloudwater {{has been investigated}} during several cloud events at Whiteface Mountain (NY), one cloud event at San Pedro Hill (CA), and one fog event at Bakersfield (CA). Samples were collected and immediately analyzed for the {{oxidation state}}s of four transition metals: Fe(II) [44 measurements], Cu(I) [30 measurements], Mn(IV) [27 measurements], and Cr(III) [3 measurements]. Extreme care was taken to minimize contamination and interferences when measuring these oxidation states. Particulate and dissolved concentrations of these metals were also determined. Other measurements performed—relevant to the redox chemistry of these metals—included pH, total elemental concentrations (Fe, Cu, Mn, Cr, Al, K, Ca, Na, and Mg), organic anions (formate, acetate, glycolate, oxalate), inorganic anions (chloride, sulfate, nitrate, sulfite), cations (sodium, calcium, magnesium, <b>potassium),</b> <b>peroxides,</b> and formaldehyde. These measurements were then used in thermodynamic-speciation models to understand the speciation of ambient fog and cloudwater. From this analysis, two different cases were found for Fe(III) soluble speciation. Fe(III) was found to exist either as Fe(OH) _ 2 ^+ or Fe(Oxalate) _ 2. However, an unidentified strong chelating ligand with Fe(III) was also suggested by the data. Cu(I) and Cu(II) were calculated to be predominantly Cu^+ and Cu^(2 +) (with less than 10 % as Cu(II) -oxalate complexes). A chemical kinetic model was also used to investigate the transition-metal chemistry. The model results indicate that Fe(II) should be the predominant chemical form of Fe during daylight conditions. This prediction is {{in agreement with the}} field measurements in which the highest ratios of Fe(II) /Fe total were found in samples collected during the day. The model results also indicated that Fe(III) should be the predominant form of Fe during nighttime conditions, which is also in agreement with the field measurements. In the model, Cu(II) and Mn(II) were the predominant oxidation states during daylight and nighttime conditions with Cu(I) and Mn(III) increasing during daylight conditions. Mn(III) concentrations were never high enough to influence the redox chemistry of Cr. Overall, Cr(VI) in cloudwater is predicted to be reduced to Cr(III) if free S(IV) is present...|$|R
