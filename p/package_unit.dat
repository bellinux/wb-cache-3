Dehumidification improved by a factor of 1. 7 to 1. 9 – meaning that the unit can provide nearly twice the water removal per unit of sensible cooling load. Performance testing results have been consistent, verifiable and repeatable.. ClimaStat™ cost-effectively controls humidity on-demand and improves indoor air quality while reducing annual energy costs. Test data clearly shows that ClimaStat™ costs 20 % to 60 % less to operate.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project was to design and test the {{components}} of a potential package sewage treatment plant suitable for the Arctic environment. The designed treatment plant was simplistic in concept while utilizing the advantages of both biological and physical-chemical treatment. The system was tested over a ten-week period. The emphasis of the testing was on treatment of high-strength wastes. In addition the effects of temperatures and system start-up-shutdown conditions were assessed. The results indicated that the system operated well under most of the conditions tested. Both the physical-chemical and biologi cal processes complemented each other with the former providing the necessary treatment at start-up and the latter providing low cost treatment once the system had been in. operation for a month. With the high degree of treatment performance achieved, it was felt the process was feasible for Arctic application.

40|$|This {{report is}} devoted to {{presenting}} {{the results of an}} investigation directed toward the design of a chemical gas generation system for the Wac Corporal. In this case the function of gas generation is to provide the necessary pressure to inject the propellants into the rocket motor. The investigation indicates that gas can be generated in the main acid tank of the, Wac by injection of a controlled amount of aniline to react with the acid. This aniline is injected {{at the bottom of the}} acid tank, and is supplied from a small pressure cell contained integrally with the injector and aniline flow regulator. Tests show that this system is able to regulate the flow of aniline into the acid tank to maintain a pressure on the propellants with ± 20 psi. of the desired value. A proposed <b>package</b> <b>unit</b> for installation on the Wac Corporal is shown in Fig 1. This unit contains all the parts necessary for the gas generation function, and its installed weight including the aniline, is estimated to be eight lbs. The importance of the installation of such a unit on the Wac is seen when it is realized that the total weight of the gas generation system, including the acid used, will be approximately 25 lbs. This system will replace the 90 lb. air pressurization unit now being used to pressurize the propellants and it will represent a 65 lb. reduction in initial gross weight. Such a weight reduction will lead to greatly improved rocket performance. This report does not attempt to determine the range of gross weights, over which gas generation systems will prove superior to other methods of propellant pressurization. It is felt, however, that a definite upper and lower limit on missile gross weight does exist for which gas generation will be applicable. The Wac Corporal is a sounding rocket of 590 lbs. gross weight using red fuming nitric acid and aniline as propellants. It was designed at the California Institute of Technology Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As the Model Driven Development (MDD) and Product Line Engineering (PLE) {{appear as}} major trends for {{reducing}} software development complexity and costs, an important missing stone becomes more visible: {{there is no}} standard and reusable assets for packaging the know-how and artifacts required when applied these approaches. To overcome this limit, we introduce in this paper the notion of MDA Component, i. e., a <b>packaging</b> <b>unit</b> for encapsulating business know-how and required resources {{in order to support}} specific operations on a certain kind of model. The aim of this work is to provide a standard way for representing this know-how <b>packaging</b> <b>units.</b> This is done by introducing a two-layer MOF-compliant metamodel. Whilst the first layer focuses on the definition of the structure and contents of the MDA Component, the second layer introduces a language independent way for describing its behavior.
