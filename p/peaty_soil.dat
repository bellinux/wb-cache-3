The high pH of the <b>peaty</b> <b>soil</b> limits the mobility of the metals however, and prevents them being taken up by crops.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ilicifolia is a {{component}} of the critically endangered Assemblage of Tumulus Springs (organic mound springs) of the Swan Coastal Plain community north of Perth, which is characterised by a permanently moist <b>peaty</b> <b>soil.</b> The dominant trees include M. preissiana, swamp banksia (B. littoralis) and flooded gum (Eucalyptus rudis), with understorey ferns such as bracken (Pteridium esculentum) and Cyclosorus interruptus, and shrubs swamp peppermint (Taxandria linearifolia) and Astartea fascicularis.|$|E
25|$|The Sow {{has several}} {{interesting}} biological specimens on its surface. Phyllodoce caerulea (Norwegian blue heather) {{is to be}} found growing on its slopes, this is a subarctic plant which requires steep, partially stabilised block scree slopes and <b>peaty</b> <b>soil.</b> At one time The Sow of Atholl was thought to be only site in the British Isles where Phyllodoce caerulea grew but it has now been located growing in the Ben Alder range as well. Other plants native to subarctic regions such as Cornus suecica (Eurasian dwarf cornel) and Sibbaldia procumbens are to be found on the hill.|$|E

2500|$|Lophospermum scandens was {{described}} in cultivation in the Liverpool Botanic Garden in 1836, where it was trained against a south wall. Its roots were protected over the winter by being covered with dry <b>peaty</b> <b>soil.</b> It {{was described}} as a [...] "truly magnificent" [...] climbing plant with the advantage of producing a succession of flowers over the summer. In 1839, it was described as [...] "easily cultivated, either in the open air or in the greenhouse".|$|E
2500|$|Three {{coniferous}} swamp communities intermix {{in areas}} of <b>peaty</b> <b>soil</b> in the park. [...] Black spruce bogs have a dense canopy of black spruce, a shrub layer of black spruce and speckled alder, an understory of bog Labrador tea or leatherleaf depending on shadiness, and a ground cover of sphagnum. [...] Tamarack bogs have an open canopy of tamarack with plenty of black spruce, a shrub layer of speckled alder and dwarf birch, and a very dense understory of leatherleaf with bog-laurel and bog-rosemary over sphagnum. [...] White cedar swamps are characterized by northern white cedar with black spruce and balsam fir, dense speckled alder shrubs, and less understory and sphagnum than the other communities.|$|E

2500|$|The {{work was}} overseen by John Rennie and Thomas Telford and {{construction}} took four years. It {{proved to be}} too narrow, resulting in further silting of the harbour, and was widened at an additional cost of £33,000 on Telford's advice. The total cost for the [...] cut was nearly £500,000, and although the navigators, who had opposed the scheme, benefitted most from it, there were new problems for drainage, with the surrounding land levels dropping as the <b>peaty</b> <b>soil</b> dried out. The Eau Brink Act created Drainage Commissioners and Navigation Commissioners, who had powers over the river to St Ives, but both bodies were subject to the Bedford Levels Corporation. Although often in opposition, the two parties worked together {{on the construction of}} a new lock and staunch at Brownshill, to improve navigation above Earith.|$|E
2500|$|Yell {{claims to}} be the [...] "Otter Capital of Britain". The shore is low-lying and the <b>peaty</b> <b>soil</b> is soft, making it ideal for {{excavation}} burrows. The long days in summer also make spotting these largely nocturnal creatures in daylight more likely than on the British mainland. Hugh Miles' documentary The Track of the Wild Otter was shot on location at Burra Ness at the mouth of Busta Voe; it gained awards and was produced for the BBC. Grey and common seals are also regular visitors to Yell's coast. Yell occasionally receives the odd Arctic visitor besides the tern; in 1977, a stray bearded seal was recorded. Normally these creatures only live on the pack ice. Humans have introduced a number of animals including rabbits, and it has even been questioned whether otters could have arrived by themselves, although this is controversial. Porpoises are occasionally seen nearby too.|$|E

60|$|We sailed on till it was dark, {{and then}} pitched our tents {{in a quiet}} creek. The {{greatest}} luxury was to find for our beds a beach of pebbles, for they were dry and yielded to the body. <b>Peaty</b> <b>soil</b> is damp; rock is uneven and hard; sand gets into one's meat, when cooked and eaten boat-fashion; but when lying in our blanket-bags, on a good bed of smooth pebbles, we passed most comfortable nights.|$|E
40|$|Alternative or {{renewable}} energy {{is a modern}} strategy with a good per­spective in the nearest future. There are several directions of {{renewable energy}} development that depend on climatic, economic and technological opportunities of a region. The perspective choice for areas with moderate climate is bioenergy. One of the bioenergy directions is agro forestry based on short rotation coppice plantations (SRC) of trees, like willow, poplar and others. The goal of experiments was {{the assessment of the}} potential of different willow species for the obtaining of energy in two climatic zones and on two types of soils of Belarus. For this purpose several morphological characteristics were metered: height of plants, biomass, diameter and number of sprouts. The field experiments were conducted on two types of soils: post-mining <b>peaty</b> <b>soils</b> in Grodno region and on degraded <b>peaty</b> <b>soils</b> in Brest region of Belarus. The same soils are very problematic for growing of traditional agricultural crops, thus willow production is a good alternative for biomass production of energy {{as well as for the}} reclamation of these soils. In our experiments the following species of willow were tested (Salix alba, Salix viminalis, Salix dasyclados, Salix aurita) that may grow on <b>peaty</b> <b>soils</b> at the natural conditions. The most popular species for modern selection of SRC of willow is Salix viminalis. Nevertheless, the most suitable morphological characteristics on post-mining <b>peaty</b> <b>soils</b> were established for plants of Salix dasyclados and on degraded <b>peaty</b> <b>soils</b> for the plants of Salix alba. The unfavorable parameters at the both type of soils were identified for the plants of Salix aurita. However, it is necessary to take into account that the used species are more popular for natural wetlands and in our experiments plants have best results of survival of cutting and rates of growth at the beginning of vegetation. In accordance with these facts Salix aurita may not be used for energy plantation directly, but it is interesting for hybridization with other species. Our results have shown that perspective hybrids for <b>peaty</b> <b>soils</b> may be for instance Salix aurita x Salix dasyclados and Salix aurita x Salix alba...|$|R
40|$|Wetland loss {{in coastal}} areas of Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes, Louisiana, largely results from two {{subsurface}} processes: (1) consolidation of recently deposited Holocene deltaic sediments and (2) active growth faulting. Locally, settlement is high where {{the thickness of}} valley fill is great and in broad interdistributary basins where the thickness of consolidation-prone, <b>peaty</b> <b>soils</b> is great. The delta cycle is identified as the fundamental sedimentologic unit that constitutes the lower delta plain. <b>Peaty</b> <b>soils</b> from the waning phase of the delta cycle are identified as the deltaic facies most subject to consolidation settlement. Data indicate direct relationships between the thickness of deltaic sediments in individual delta cycles, and the thickness of <b>peaty</b> <b>soils</b> capping these cycles, with present patterns of coastal tract land loss. In addition, active growth faulting is correlated with new areas of interior tract wetland loss. Consolidation and faulting largely explain the curious nature of wetland loss patterns in south Louisiana. Subsidence in The Netherlands {{has been attributed to}} similar causes, i. e. thick deposits of consolidation-prone sediments that accumulate on the downthrown sides of basin margin faults...|$|R

60|$|He {{remembered a}} sudden jolt {{and the front}} wheels skidding. They had {{obviously}} struck something, {{and when he got}} the car straight had skidded again the other way. The marks the tires had made indicated this, and he examined the neighboring ground. The silverweed that covered the <b>peaty</b> <b>soil</b> between the road and ditch was not much crushed. He had, as he remembered, not gone far on that side before he, for a moment, recovered control of the car. The real trouble began when it swerved again and ran across the road. Something had caught the wheels and interfered with the steering.|$|E
60|$|On {{one side}} the barren moor, getting dim in the distance, rolled {{back to the}} edge of the low country. Here and there patches of melting sleet gleamed a livid white among the {{withered}} ling, and storm-torn hummocks of <b>peaty</b> <b>soil</b> shone dark chocolate-brown. These were the only touches of color in the dreary landscape, except for the streak of pale-yellow sky that glimmered above a long black ridge. On the other side, a line of rugged fells with summits lost in snow clouds, rose dark and forbidding. It was very cold and a biting wind swept the heath.|$|E
60|$|The heath got rougher {{when they}} left the wall. Spongy moss grew among the ling that caught their feet, and the ground began to rise. Looking at the sun, Foster saw they were not taking as northerly a line as he had expected, but the back of a bold ridge rose between them and the west and he {{supposed}} Pete meant to follow its other side. They stopped to eat the food they had brought where a stream had worn away a hollow in a bank. The sun, striking the wall of <b>peaty</b> <b>soil</b> behind them, was pleasantly warm. It was a calm day, with slowly-drifting clouds, and gray shadows streaked the wide, brown waste.|$|E

60|$|Leaving the thumbless archer and his brood, the wayfarers struck {{through the}} {{scattered}} huts of Emery Down, and out {{on to the}} broad rolling heath covered deep in ferns and in heather, where droves of the half-wild black forest pigs were rooting about amongst the hillocks. The woods about this point fall away {{to the left and}} the right, while the road curves upwards and the wind sweeps keenly over the swelling uplands. The broad strips of bracken glowed red and yellow against the black <b>peaty</b> <b>soil,</b> and a queenly doe who grazed among them turned her white front and her great questioning eyes towards the wayfarers. Alleyne gazed in admiration at the supple beauty of the creature; but the archer's fingers played with his quiver, and his eyes glistened with the fell instinct which urges a man to slaughter.|$|E
6000|$|The theatre {{is worthy}} of the scenes acted on it.

Every one has heard of the climate of these regions; it may be compared to that which is experienced {{at the height of}} between one and two thousand feet, on the mountains of North Wales; having however less sunshine and less frost, but more wind and rain. (9/4. From accounts published since our voyage, and more especially from several interesting letters from Captain Sulivan, R.N., employed on the survey, it appears that we took an exaggerated view of the badness of the climate on these islands. But when I reflect on the almost universal covering of peat, and on the fact of wheat seldom ripening here, I can hardly believe that the climate in summer is so fine and dry as it has lately been represented.) ...|$|E
60|$|UTRICULARIA MONTANA.--This species inhabits the {{tropical}} parts of South America, and {{is said to}} be epiphytic; but, judging from the state of the roots (rhizomes) of some dried specimens from the herbarium at Kew, it likewise lives in earth, probably in crevices of rocks. In English hothouses it is grown in <b>peaty</b> <b>soil.</b> Lady Dorothy Nevill was so kind as to give me a fine plant, and I received another from Dr. Hooker. The leaves are entire, instead of being much divided, as in the foregoing aquatic species. They are elongated, about 1 1/2 inch in breadth, and furnished with a distinct footstalk. The plant produces numerous colourless rhizomes, as thin as threads, which bear minute bladders, and occasionally swell into tubers, as will [page 432] hereafter be described. These rhizomes appear exactly like roots, but occasionally throw up green shoots. They penetrate the earth sometimes to the depth of more than 2 inches; but when the plant grows as an epiphyte, they must creep amidst the mosses, roots, decayed bark, &c., with which the trees of these countries are thickly covered.|$|E
