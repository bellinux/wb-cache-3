This paper presents research into the evaluation of direct and indirect additive manufacture of a maxillofacial prosthesis against conventional laboratory-based techniques. An implant/magnet-retained nasal prosthesis case from a UK maxillofacial unit was selected as a case study. A benchmark prosthesis was fabricated using conventional laboratory-based techniques for comparison against additive manufactured prostheses. For the computer-aided workflow, photogrammetry, computer-aided design and additive manufacture (AM) methods were evaluated in direct <b>prosthesis</b> <b>body</b> fabrication and indirect production using an additively manufactured mould. Qualitative analysis of position, shape, colour and edge quality was undertaken. Mechanical testing to ISO standards was also used to compare the silicone rubber used in the conventional prosthesis with the AM material. Critical evaluation has shown that utilising a computer-aided workflow can produce a <b>prosthesis</b> <b>body</b> that is comparable to that produced using existing best practice. Technical limitations currently prevent the direct fabrication method demonstrated in this paper from being clinically viable. This research helps prosthesis providers understand the application of a computer-aided approach and guides technology developers and researchers to address the limitations identified...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe Sorin Bicarbon {{prosthesis}} (Sorin Biomedica, Saluggia, Italy) is a bileaflet valve with curved-profile leaflets, {{a rolling}} hinge mechanism, and a pyrolytic carbon—coated titanium alloy housing and sewing ring. Although the Sorin Bicarbon prosthesis has been implanted in greater than 80, 000 patients, and reference values on the hemodynamic performance of valve prostheses {{are needed to}} avoid patient-prosthesis mismatch, few Doppler echocardiographic data {{are available on the}} prosthesis in the aortic position. The aim {{of this study is to}} provide a detailed echocardiographic evaluation of the hemodynamic performance and regression of left ventricular hypertrophy after aortic valve replacement with the Sorin Bicarbon prosthesis. MethodsThe study included 182 patients who received a 21 -mm (n = 61) or 23 -mm (n = 121) Sorin Bicarbon prosthesis for pure or prevalent aortic stenosis who underwent serial echocardiograms at 3, 6, and 12 months after aortic valve replacement. ResultsMean and peak gradients significantly decreased (P <. 001) during follow-up to values of 12 ± 3 and 22 ± 6 mm Hg for the 21 -mm prosthesis and values of 11 ± 4 and 19 ± 6 mm Hg for the 23 -mm prosthesis at 1 year. Left ventricular mass index showed a 17 % decrease to 120 ± 27 g/m 2 in recipients of the 21 -mm prosthesis (P <. 001) and a 21 % decrease to 123 ± 29 g/m 2 in recipients of the 23 -mm prosthesis (P <. 001). A larger prosthesis size was the only predictor of a higher left ventricular mass index regression. Among recipients of the 21 -mm <b>prosthesis,</b> <b>body</b> surface area of greater than 1. 85 m 2 was associated with a lower regression of left ventricular mass index. The effective orifice area index was 1. 00 ± 0. 11 and 1. 08 ± 0. 14 cm 2 /m 2 in recipients of the 21 -mm and 23 -mm prostheses, respectively. ConclusionsSize 21 mm and 23 mm Sorin Bicarbon prostheses show low transprosthetic gradients, with significant reduction of left ventricular mass index during the first postoperative year. The reported effective orifice areas might be useful for aortic valve replacement in patients with a small aortic annulus to avoid patient-prosthesis mismatch...|$|E

5000|$|... 316 {{stainless}} steel, {{also referred}} to as marine grade stainless steel, is a chromium, nickel, molybdenum alloy of steel that exhibits relatively good strength and corrosion resistance. Along with the titanium alloy Ti6Al4V, 316 stainless is a common choice of material for biomedical implants. Although Ti6Al4V provides greater strength per weight and corrosion resistance, 316 stainless components can be more economical to produce. However, immune system reaction to nickel is a potential complication of 316.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} <b>prosthesis</b> satisfaction and <b>body</b> image in lower limb prosthesis users, and the gendered variations within these relationships. Method: A total of 44 valid responses were obtained to an Internet survey regarding <b>prosthesis</b> satisfaction, <b>body</b> image, and phantom pain. Spearman Rho correlations were calculated for these three domains. Results: Moderate to high negative correlations were observed between Body Image Disturbance and Prosthesis Satisfaction. These were consistent across genders. Other relationships were also revealed, including positive correlations between Prosthesis Satisfaction with hours of use and negative correlations between Prosthesis Satisfaction and pain experience, though strong differences between genders were observed for these. The length of time for which respondents had had their prosthesis bore little relation to other variables. Conclusion: The present research is instructive of the close relationship between <b>body</b> image and <b>prosthesis</b> satisfaction, as well as gender variations in these relationships, in lower-limb prosthesis users.

40|$|This thesis {{explored}} {{the roles of}} body image and self-disgust, as self-appraisals, in their relationship to psychosocial adjustment and related factors in people with limb amputations. The thesis includes a systematic literature review of body image relating to psychosocial adjustment and a research paper examining the relationship of self-disgust to psychosocial adjustment following limb amputation. A critical appraisal of the research process and an ethics section are also included. Section one presents a quantitative systematic literature review of sixteen studies examining body image perception as a correlate or predictor of demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors related to adjustment following limb amputation. Body image concerns {{were found to be}} associated with poorer outcomes on several psychosocial factors, such as depression, anxiety, activity restriction and self-esteem, as well as prosthesis satisfaction. Findings are discussed in regard to theories of body image. Body image is proposed as an important consideration for clinical and prosthetic services, in working with people with limb amputations. In section two, an empirical study of quantitative, cross sectional methodology is presented, in which correlational and hierarchical regression analysis are used to examine the relationship of self-disgust to psychosocial adjustment and related factors; prosthesis use, <b>prosthesis</b> satisfaction, and <b>body</b> image. Self-disgust was found to correlate with each of the outcome measures and to significantly contribute to variance in psychosocial adjustment, prosthesis use, aesthetic <b>prosthesis</b> satisfaction and <b>body</b> image. Self-disgust emerged as an important consideration in understanding poor adjustment to amputation. Section three includes a critical appraisal of the research process, in which reflections are presented on the design of the study, the importance of researching difficult topics, such as selfdisgust, and potential areas for future research...|$|R

Amputees Bodily Image Scale(ABIS) was;used to assess BI. A self-design questionnaire wag used to evaluate the prosthesis satisfaction of amputees. Results The scores of SF- 36,ABIS,and prosthesis satisfaction wag 41. 90 ± 15. 00, 64. 58 ± 10. 60,and 59. 52 ± 11. 06,respectively. The ABIS scores in women(65. 07 ± 12. 10) were hisher than that in men(63. 20 ± 5. 0) (P＜ 0. 05). There was a positive correlation between score of QOL and prosthesis satisfaction,but a negative correlation between QOL and BI. The negative correlations were also observed between BI and Vitality,BI and mental health. Prosthesis satisfaction had positive correla tions with education level. QOL and mental health.

Knowledge of the mechanical and tribological properties of skin associated with these structural changes are needed {{to aid in the}} design of exoskeletons, <b>prostheses,</b> orthotics, <b>body</b> mounted sensors used for kinematics measurements and in optimum use of wearable on-body devices. In this case study, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and digital image correlation (DIC) were combined to determine skin surface strain and sub-surface deformation behaviour of the volar forearm due to natural tissue stretching. The thickness of the epidermis together with geometry changes of the dermal-epidermal junction boundary were calculated during change in the arm angle, from flexion (90 °) to full extension (180 °). This posture change caused an increase in skin surface Lagrange strain, typically by 25 % which induced considerable morphological changes in the upper skin layers evidenced by reduction of epidermal layer thickness (20 %), flattening of the dermal-epidermal junction undulation (45 – 50 % reduction of flatness being expressed as Ra and Rz roughness profile height change) and reduction of skin surface roughness Ra and Rz (40 – 50 %).

40|$|Background: Sport {{prostheses}} {{are used}} by both upper- and lower-limb amputees while participating in sports and other physical activities. Although the number of these devices has increased over the past decade, no overview of the peer reviewed literature describing them has been published previously. Such an overview will allow specialists to choose appropriate prostheses based on available scientific evidence rather than on personal experience or preference. Objective: To {{provide an overview of}} the sport prostheses as they are described by the papers published in peer reviewed literature. Study Design: Literature review. Methods: Four electronic databases were searched using free text and Medical Subject Headings (MESH) terms. Papers were included if they concerned a prosthesis or a prosthetic adaptation used in sports. Papers were excluded if they did not originate from peer reviewed sources, if they concerned <b>prostheses</b> for <b>body</b> parts other than the upper or lower limbs, if they concerned amputations distal to the wrist or ankle, or if they were written in a language other than English. Results: Twenty-four papers were included in this study. The vast majority contained descriptive data and consisted of expert opinions and technical notes. Conclusion: Data concerning the energy efficiency, technical characteristics and special mechanical properties of prostheses or prosthetic adaptations for sports, other than running, are scarce.

The collapsed talar body was removed using a lateral transfibular approach and the prosthesis was fixed to the residual talar neck with cement. The mean follow-up period was 20 months. The score on the AOFAS ankle hindfoot scale improved from 37 points to 82 points when measured at the follow-up point. Remarkable pain relief and improvement of walking ability were obtained in all patients. Under postoperative radiography, prostheses showed good congruency both with the tibia and posterior facet of the calcaneus in all patients. Although the follow-up duration was short, results were satisfactory. Alumina ceramic has high compatibility with articular cartilage and is a good material for the artificial talar body.

40|$|Trans-humeral amputees {{have for}} a long time had {{suspension}} methods that limit the functionality and use of the prosthesis. Due to the cone shape of the amputated stump, suspension of the prosthesis has mainly been done with harness securing the <b>prosthesis</b> to the <b>body.</b> The harness crosses the back and goes around the axilla of the contralateral shoulder. This may cause back and neck problems to-gether with pain in the contralateral axilla. The range of movement for positioning the prosthesis is also limited with the harnessed prosthesis. For the trans-humeral amputee, positioning the artificial arm is crucial to obtain the benefits the pros-thesis can give. Since the elbow joint is absent, the only way of positioning the prosthesis is by using the shoulder movements. If the prosthesis and its suspension limit the effective range of movement, the functionality of the prosthesis will be reduced.

40|$|Osseointegration of {{implants}} {{in the jaw}} bone {{has been}} studied thoroughly, dealing with various aspects such as bone apposition, bone quality, microbiology, biomechanics, aesthetics, etc. A key issue that has received much less attention is the physiologic integration of the implant(s) and the associated <b>prosthesis</b> in the <b>body.</b> The latter aspect is however very important to obtain new insights in oral functioning with implant-supported prostheses. Amputated patients rehabilitated with a lower limb prosthesis anchored to the bone {{by means of an}} osseointegrated implant, have reported that they could recognize the type of soil they were walking on. Clinical observations on patients with oral implants, have confirmed a special sensory perception skill. The underlying mechanism of this so-called 'osseoperception' phenomenon remains a matter of debate, because extraction of teeth involves elimination of the extremely sensitive periodontal ligaments while functional reinnervation around implants is still uncertain. Histological, neurophysiological and psychophysical evidence of osseoperception have been collected, making the assumption more likely that a proper peripheral feedback pathway can be restored when using osseointegrated implants. This implant-mediated sensory-motor control may have important clinical implications, because a more natural functioning with implant-supported prostheses can be attempted.

It can be observed that the smallest values of the force and of the friction coefficient are obtained for the prostheses with balls and self-directed movement (approximately 5 times smaller than the values obtained for a classical prosthesis). For all the couples tested, the friction force grows with the growth of the normal load and of the oscillation speed. Changing the contact mechanism for the artificial hip joint from one sliding contact between two large surfaces, to a multitude of rolling contacts, could lead to some problems regarding functionality and durability of the active prosthesis elements. The key to an accurate evaluation of damaging mechanisms acting on THP with self directed rolling balls is a clear and complete picture of the load transfer mechanism.

40|$|<b>Prostheses</b> are {{artificial}} <b>body</b> {{parts that}} can be used by amputees. Myoelectric prostheses are controlled by so-called surface electromyograms (sEMG) that are acquired on the skin surface of the residual limb. A well-known problem in myoelectric prostheses is motion artifacts, these artifacts cause unwanted behaviour of the prosthesis. The {{purpose of this study is}} to try to cancel the effect motion artifacts have on myoelectric prosthesis control, in order to avoid unsolicited prosthesis behaviour. The subject of myoelectric prostheses and motion artifacts are outlined in this study, together with the development and characterisation of a sensor that can do simultaneous measurements of sEMG and contact forces between a surface electrode and the skin. A protocol has been developed for the recording of the different signals in a laboratory. Suitable data sets have been recorded from one test subject, and signal processing and pattern recognition methods have been applied on these data sets to generate muscle force estimates. The pattern recognition methods were linear and quadratic mapping functions, and multi-layer perceptron network. To achieve better force estimates when motion artifacts are presence, signals from FSRs are taken into consideration together with sEMG signals. A qualitative comparison reveals obvious improvements for the sEMG sensor when FSR measurement is included. The system presently undergoes quantitative assessment of static and dynamic performance. The final step will hopefully be to integrate FSRs in a real prosthesis. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground and objectivePhantom limb pain (PLP) is a {{major problem}} after limb amputation. Mirror therapy (MT) is a non-pharmacological {{treatment}} using representations of movement, the efficacy of which in reducing PLP remains to be clarified. Here, we present the first systematic review on MT efficacy in PLP and phantom limb movement (PLM) in amputees (lower or upper limb). MethodsA search on Medline, Cochrane Database and Embase, crossing the keywords “Phantom Limb” and “Mirror Therapy” found studies which were read and analyzed according the PRISMA statement. ResultsTwenty studies were selected, 12 on the subject of MT and PLP, 3 on MT and PLM, 5 on MT and both (PLP and PLM). Among these 20 studies, 5 were randomized controlled trials (163 patients), 6 prospective studies (55 patients), 9 case studies (40 patients) and methodologies were heterogeneous. Seventeen of the 18 studies reported the efficacy of MT on PLP, but with low levels of evidence. One randomized controlled trial did not show any significant effect of MT. As to the effect of MT on PLM, the 8 studies concerned reported effectiveness of MT: 4 with a low level of evidence and 4 {{with a high level of}} evidence. An alternative to visual illusion seems to be tactile or auditory stimulation. ConclusionWe cannot recommend MT as a first intention treatment in PLP. The level of evidence is insufficient.

40|$|Biomedical micro {{implants}} {{are used}} as neural <b>prostheses</b> to restore <b>body</b> functions after paraplegia by means of functional electrical stimulation (FES). Polymer electronic technology offers the potential to integrate flexible electronic circuits on microelectrodes in order to overcome the limit of traditional FES systems. This paper describes an approach of flexible organic transistors {{in order to develop}} a flexible biomedical micro implant for FES use. Polyimide shows excellent biocompatibility and biostability properties for flexible multi-channel microelectrodes in neural prosthetics application (Stieglitz et al 1997 Sensors Actuators A 60 240 - 3). Therefore, it was used as a flexible substrate on which polymer transistors have to be integrated. Gold or platinum was sputtered as the gate, drain and source. In this paper polyimide has been investigated as a gate isolator because of its high flexibility and biocompatibility. Polyimide was spin coated and imidized at different temperatures and times. Pentacene (C 14 H 22) was evaporated at UHV and 75 degrees C substrate temperature as an active layer in an organic field effect transistor (OFET). Plasma activation and self-assembled monolayer surface modification were used to advance the electrical properties of organic transistors. The whole transistor was encapsulated in parylene C that was evaporated at room temperature using a standard Gorham system (Gorham 1966 J. Polym. Sci. A- 1 4 3027 - 39). Investigation of the electrical properties of the OFET using polyimide as the isolator led to promising results...|$|R
