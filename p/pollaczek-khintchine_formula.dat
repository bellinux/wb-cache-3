40|$|The {{classical}} renewal-theory (waiting time, or inspection) paradox {{states that}} {{the length of the}} renewal interval that covers a randomly-selected time epoch tends to be longer than an ordinary renewal interval. This paradox manifests itself in numerous interesting ways in queueing theory, a prime example being the celebrated <b>Pollaczek-Khintchine</b> <b>formula</b> for the mean waiting time in the M/G/ 1 queue. In this expository paper, we give intuitive arguments that &# 147;explain&# 148; why the renewal-theory paradox is ubiquitous in queueing theory, and why it sometimes produces anomalous results. In particular, we use these intuitive arguments to explain decomposition in vacation models, and to derive formulas that describe some recently-discovered counterintuitive results for polling models, such as the reduction of waiting times as a consequence of forcing the server to set up even when no work is waiting...|$|E
40|$|O. J. Boxma and J. W. Cohen {{recently}} obtained {{an explicit}} expression for the M/G/ 1 steady-state waiting-time distribution {{for a class}} of service-time distributions with power tails. We extend their explicit representation from a one-parameter family of service-time distributions to a two-parameter family. The complementary cumulative distribution function (ccdf's) of the service times all have the asymptotic form F c (t) # #t - 3 / 2 as t # #, so that the associated waiting-time ccdf's have asymptotic form W c (t) # #t - 1 / 2 as t # #. Thus the second moment of the service time and {{the mean of the}} waiting time are infinite. Our result here also extends our own earlier explicit expression for the M/G/ 1 steady-state waiting-time distribution when the service-time distribution is an exponential mixture of inverse Gaussian distributions (EMIG). The EMIG distributions form a two-parameter family with ccdf having the asymptotic form F c (t) # #t - 3 / 2 e -#t as t # #. We now show that a variant of our previous argument applies when the service-time ccdf is an undamped EMIG, i. e., with ccdf G c (t) = e #t F c (t) for F c (t) above, which has the power tail G c (t) # #t - 3 / 2 as t # #. The Boxma-Cohen long-tail service-time distribution is a special case of an undamped EMIG.
