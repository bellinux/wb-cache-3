40|$|International audienceThe {{modern society}} is, nowadays, facing two major problems: the energy sources {{depletion}} and {{the degradation of}} the ecologic system because of wastes rejection. The energetic valorization of wastes contributes on the resolution of both problems. In the present work, a feasibility study of an <b>industrial</b> <b>pilot</b> scale <b>installation</b> {{for the production of}} biodiesel from waste grease traps is lead. The installation is meant to transform 1000 tons of fat trap grease per year to biodiesel by transesterification. The daily production of the unit reaches 3200 l of biodiesel. All necessary equipments were sized following process engineering design and based on lab scale optimization experiments. Installation energy balance was also realized and it showed that the energy required for the installation functioning does not exceed 3. 5 % of the heating value of produced biodiesel...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{places the}} 1989 Australian {{domestic}} pilots and airlines dispute {{in the context}} of <b>pilot</b> <b>industrial</b> relations 'norms', <b>pilot</b> <b>industrial</b> relations history and the political and economic environment. The aim is to gain a greater understanding of the 1989 dispute and to answer questions such as whether the dispute stood out from its context as an inexplicable development. It was discovered that the reasons behind the dispute went well beyond the AFAP claim for a 29. 47 % salary increase. The dispute built up over a lengthy period and can only be properly understood by considering: - the nature of the pilot community and pilot militancy, - the history of <b>pilot</b> <b>industrial</b> relations, - <b>pilot</b> bargaining patterns, - the individuals involved in <b>pilot</b> <b>industrial</b> relations, - the impact of the Accord on pilot bargaining, - the interventionist approach of labor governments to <b>pilot</b> <b>industrial</b> relations, - the roles of the ACTU and the AIRC, - the impact of neo-corporatism in the Australian industrial relations system, - the impact of aviation deregulation, - the impact of economic fortunes, - any many others [...] . <b>Pilot</b> <b>industrial</b> relations and salary determination will be considered in the period since the Whitlam Government, with reference to the parties, the influences upon them and the environment in which their relationships were conducted. Emphasis will be given to the implications for and of the 1989 dispute. Observations shall also be made about the future of <b>pilot</b> <b>industrial</b> relations...|$|R
