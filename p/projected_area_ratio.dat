40|$|The {{uniformity}} of the coating thickness distribution {{is an important}} quality metric {{in the manufacture of}} pharmaceutical tablets during the spray coating process. An investigation of the asymptotic limits of coating thickness variability of tablets of varying shape was carried out based on the cap-to-band coating thickness distributions. A theoretical analysis shows that the cap-to-band coating thickness ratio is expected to be equal to the cap-to-band area ratio projected onto the spray direction divided by the actual cap-to-band surface area ratio. When the cap-to-band <b>projected</b> <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> is larger (or smaller) than the cap-to-band surface area ratio, the mean coating thickness on the cap is larger (or smaller) than that on the band. To verify this, the dynamics of tablets in a rotating pan was modelled using discrete element method (DEM) simulations, while an image analysis technique based on the output of DEM simulations was applied to model the spray coating process and analyse the cap-to-band coating thickness ratio. A ray-tracing sampling method was further used to obtain the cap-to-band sample ratio. It was also found that a smaller spray angle with respect to the horizontal direction can decrease and even invert the cap-to-band coating thickness ratio, leading to a larger coating thickness on the band than the cap. Nevertheless, an asymptotic value of cap-to-band relative standard deviation can be reached once the cap-to-band coating thickness ratio becomes stable during the coating process. This asymptotic limit is within the range predicted based on the cap-to-band <b>projected</b> <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> and surface area ratio.

40|$|A brief look at {{the history}} of {{fractography}} has shown a recent trend in the quantification of topographic parameters through the use of three-dimensional reconstruction techniques, which associate SEM stereoscopy and stereophotogrammetry software, allowing the calculation of the elevation measurement at numerous points of the topography due to the parallax that takes place during the tilting of the sample along the microscope eucentric plane. Several investigators have used reconstruction techniques to correlate some fractographic parameters, such as fractal dimension and fractured to <b>projected</b> <b>area</b> <b>ratio,</b> to the mechanical properties of materials, such as fracture toughness and tensile strength. So far, the search for a clear relationship between the fracture topography and mechanical properties has provided ambiguous results. The present work applied a surface metrology software to reconstruct three-dimensionally fracture surfaces (transgranular cleavage, intergranular and dimple fracture), corrosion pits and tribo-surfaces in order to explore the potential of this stereophotogrammetry technique. The existence of a variation in the calculated topographic parameters with the conditions of SEM image acquisition reinforces the importance of both good image acquisition and accurate calibration methods in order to validate this 3 D reconstruction technique in metrological terms. Preliminary results did not indicate the existence of a clear relationship between either the true to project area ratio and CVN absorbed energy or the fractal dimension and CVN absorbed energy. It is likely that each fracture mechanism presents a proper relationship between the fractographic parameters and mechanical properties. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Four popular algorithms are evaluated based on their cell segmentation performance. Because segmentation involves the classification of pixels belonging to regions within the cell or belonging to background, these algorithms are evaluated based on their total misclassification error. Misclassification error is particularly relevant {{in the analysis of}} quantitative descriptors of cell morphology involving pixel counts, such as <b>projected</b> <b>area,</b> aspect <b>ratio</b> and diameter.

30|$|Since {{the weight}} of the roof and the roof frame members {{correspond}} to vertical load, as described above, these loads were determined from the measured weight values of those members discharged during the demolition. As shown in Figs.  1 a and 2, the front eaves consisted of a large overhang from the roof frame. The load of the overhanging section was supported with a horizontal bridging member, called “Hanegi”. When examining the structure of the roof frame, it was confirmed that this load did not affect the strain measurement on the roof girder. In other words, since both the load of the roof frame and the load of the overhanging roof are included in total discharge weight above, those should be separated. The overhanging sections were partitioned in proportion to the <b>projected</b> <b>areas</b> <b>ratio</b> on the horizontal plane from the roof frame and non-over-hanging section. The area portion of the non-overhanging section is 47.8  % and from this, the load of the non-overhanging section was estimated. By multiplying this value with the 14.3  % load-sharing percentage of the vertical frame including the roof girder used in strain measurement, the vertical load used in the analysis could be calculated. Corresponding to each strain measurement day shown in Table  2, the stress analysis was carried out by allocating loads to the roof and the roof frame according to the demolition conditions during the strain measurement day. Sequentially {{from the top of the}} roof frame, {{the weight of}} a vertical member and the load between the vertical members at one layer above were taken as the vertical load. Although the actual demolition progressed locally and independently in both the vertical and horizontal planes rather than evenly (on average), this point was not considered in this analysis.|$|R

There {{was an increase in}} SPAR with depth in the crown in both control and fertilized trees. In the fertilized trees, how-ever, mean SPAR was larger overall, the increase with depth in the crown was steeper, and there was a larger variation in SPAR with inclination and rotation angle of the shoot (relative to the view direction). In particular, shoots in the lower crown of fertilized trees were rotationally asymmetrical (“flat”) and had high values of the maximum ratio of shoot silhouette <b>area</b> to <b>projected</b> leaf <b>area</b> (SPARmax). Differences in SPAR between fertilized and control trees were explained by changes in shoot structure in response to fertilization and shading. Shoots of fertilized trees were larger and had more needle area than shoots of control trees. How-ever, the <b>ratio</b> of needle <b>area</b> to shoot size was smaller in fertil-ized trees than in control trees, implying less within-shoot shading and, consequently, a larger SPAR. Also, the increase in SPAR with increased shading (depth in the crown) could be explained by a decrease in the <b>ratio</b> of needle <b>area</b> to shoot size. In addition, because fertilized trees had more needle area than control trees, the effect of shading at a given depth in the crown was more pronounced in fertilized trees than in control trees...|$|R

In addition, seedling early growth, including DMA and LA, negatively correlated with RS, R/LA, Nmass, Narea and δ 13 C, and positively correlated with SLA, LA/SA, SD, SL and TSL.

40|$|Abstract: Basic {{experiment}} for estimating a solid contact <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> {{of dried}} interface by longitudinal ultrasonic wave pulses is attempted. The <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> is estimated by echo height ratio H defined by sound pressure which depends on central frequency in one cycle of received waves. H is different by distance and topography {{of the solid}} contact part and wavelength, even if the solid contact <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> is same. However, one law is clarified by arranging this relation with dimensionless distance Λ(=ι/λ) which depends on the distance ι of the solid contact point and the wavelength λ. H is shown by a curve which depends only on the solid contact <b>area</b> <b>ratio,</b> and then, it for any <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> monotonously approaches the non-contacting <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> with increasing Λ. This tendency shows that the solid contact <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> can be directly estimated from the echo height ratio measured by using the high frequency probe. Since the attenuation of the high frequency wave is remarkable, however, {{there is a limit}} of the measurement thickness. Therefore, the measurement by the low frequency probe is required.

To study the reliability of ARF and CWAR as single parameters, the correlations of ARF and CWAR with the tension strength were determined for 57 planks. The coefficients of determination for ARF were slightly better than those for CWAR, although both of them seemed to be quite poor predictors of tension capacity when used alone. Therefore, a multiparameter model is preferred and should be a subject for further studies.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} calibration of the NASA Glenn Research Center 16 in. Mass-Flow Plug (MFP) are presented and compared to a previously obtained calibration of a 15 in. Mass-Flow Plug. An ASME low-beta, long-radius nozzle {{was used as the}} calibration reference. The discharge coefficient for the ASME nozzle was obtained by numerically simulating the flow through the nozzle from the WIND-US code. The results showed agreement between the 15 and 16 in. MFPs for <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> (MFP to pipe <b>area</b> <b>ratio)</b> greater than 0. 6 but deviate at <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> below this value for reasons that are not fully understood. A general uncertainty analysis was also performed and indicates that large uncertainties in the calibration are present for low MFP <b>area</b> <b>ratios...</b>|$|R
30|$|For calcium nitrate, the {{corrosion}} <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> after 1  week was 3.96 % (lower {{than that}} in sodium chloride for the same duration). However, after 2  weeks, the corrosion <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> increased to 95 %, which was much higher than that for sodium chloride. The calcium acetate solution showed no corrosion for 2  weeks, and a corrosion <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> of approximately 1 % was observed after 3  weeks. A thin layer of red corrosion was observed {{on the surface of}} the steel plate in this case.|$|R
40|$|A {{centrifugal}} impeller which was initially {{designed for a}} pressure ratio of approximately 5. 5 and a mass flow rate of 0. 959 kg/sec was tested with a vaneless diffuser {{for a range of}} design point impeller <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> from 2. 322 to 2. 945. The impeller <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> was changed by successively cutting back the impeller exit axial width from an initial value of 7. 57 mm to a final value of 5. 97 mm. In all, four separate <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> were tested. For each <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> a series of impeller exit axial clearances was also tested. Test results are based on impeller exit surveys of total pressure, total temperature, and flow angle at a radius 1. 115 times the impeller exit radius. Results of the tests at design speed, peak efficiency, and an exit tip clearance of 8 percent of exit blade height show that the impeller equivalent pressure recovery coefficient peaked at a design point <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> of approximately 2. 748 while the impeller aerodynamic efficiency peaked at a lower value of <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> of approximately 2. 55. The variation of impeller efficiency with clearance showed expected trends with a loss of approximately 0. 4 points in impeller efficiency for each percent increase in exit axial tip clearance for all impellers tested...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} if the Hess <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> is effective in predicting postoperative diplopia in patients undergoing surgery for orbital blow-out fracture. METHODS: Our retrospective, interventional case series study involved 30 consecutive cases affected by orbital fractures and diplopia undergoing surgical correction within 7 days after injury. To evaluate ocular motility disturbance, we measured the involved ocular motility range by use of a manual Hess screen test before and 4 months after surgery. The percentage of Hess <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> % was used to express the range of ocular motility in a numerical value. RESULTS: All patients with preoperative Hess <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> > 85 % had no postoperative diplopia, and most patients (57 %) having a preoperative Hess <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> < 65 % had postoperative diplopia. When the Hess <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> was between 65 % and 85 %, surgical outcomes were variable and most patients (55 %) described no problematic diplopia in the peripheral visual field. CONCLUSIONS: The Hess <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> is a useful procedure to convert Hess graphic representation in a numerical value so that Hess chart data can be compared among clinicians and used to predict surgical outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for orbital blow-out fractures. © 2009 The American Society of Opthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Studies of {{the effect}} of <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> {{variation}} on the performance of a supersonic Hall MHD duct were extended up to <b>area</b> <b>ratios</b> of 6. 25 / 1. It is shown that for a given <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> there is a combustion pressure above which the power generating region of the duct is shock free and the power output increases linearly with the square of the magnetic field. Below this pressure a shock forms in the duct which moves upstream with increasing magnetic field strength and results in a less rapid rise in power output...|$|R

This necessitates the use of a thinner stencil.For BGA/CSP and other very small Apertures, the <b>Area</b> <b>Ratio</b> is used. It should be greater than 0.66, as this ensures a high probability of good fill and release. An <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> below 0.66 would mean a much less reliable process.|$|R
40|$|Urban {{ventilation}} {{is important}} for the purpose of pollution dispersion, indoor ventilation for free running buildings and urban thermal comfort. In comparison to suburban cities, high-density cities have very low wind speeds at pedestrian level due to the densely built buildings blocking the wind and creating stagnant zones locally. Under this circumstance, field measurements were performed to investigate the performance of pedestrian wind at four major cities in Klang Valley. Mean wind speed was measured using anemometers at 1 minute data interval for 3 hours and the data collection for each case were obtained at pedestrian level. The mean wind speed ratio was plotted against the frontal <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> and plan <b>area</b> <b>ratio.</b> The result indicates that: (1) the mean wind speed dramatically decreases with the increase of plan <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> and (2) the mean wind speed exponentially decreases with the increase of frontal <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> and qualitatively agrees with the power law relationship which is proposed by previous researcher. In addition, the frontal <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> is considered as a better parameter to evaluate the performance of urban ventilation...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable urban {{development}} is a challenge that requires handling of different goals and conflicts, such as between a dense urban structure on one hand, {{and the need for}} ecosystem services on the other. The Green <b>Area</b> <b>Ratio</b> is a type of planning tool used to ensure a certain amount of vegetation and water in the built environment. The purpose of this report is to provide a knowledge basis to integrate ecosystem services in spatial planning. The goal is to provide an overview of the use of The Green <b>Area</b> <b>Ratio</b> in Sweden as well as the experience gained. The Green <b>Area</b> <b>Ratio</b> is used in at least 15 municipalities. There is currently no systematic evaluation of how the Green <b>Area</b> <b>Ratio</b> contributes to ecosystem services. Even if it might change the rules in planning, it is not obvious that this leads to a satisfactory built environment. The Green <b>Area</b> <b>Ratio</b> is a general type of planning tool and it therefore lacks an adoption to the site-specific needs of ecosystem services...|$|R
