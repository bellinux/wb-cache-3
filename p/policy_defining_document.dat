40|$|Against the {{background}} of decades of limitedly successful Western international statebuilding efforts and {{in light of the}} recent heightened attention to (state-building in) Africa, this study investigates the feasibility of less international involvement instead of more. To make such assessment convincingly, the involvement needs to be identified as counterproductive to the achievement of peaceful well-functioning societies, and the counter-productivity is to be located in the involvement as such and not just linked to its defective implementation. To this effect, this paper proposes the conceptual framework of the EU as an ‘Ethical Intervener’ as an instrument to deconstruct the EU’s well-intended Africa policies into the mechanisms (‘Inequality Mechanism’ and ‘Intervener-Centric Mechanisms’) that are potentially detrimental to the achievement of these ethical goals. The conceptual framework is applied to some of the <b>defining</b> <b>policy</b> <b>documents</b> in EU–Africa relations of the last decade, thus incorporating the most recent developments such as the focus on the principles of ownership, equality and partnership. In conclusion, we reflect on the feasibility of less international involvement by differentiating between the avoidable and unavoidable problematics in today’s state-building efforts...|$|R
40|$|Browsers do not {{currently}} support the secure sharing of JavaScript objects between principals. We present this prob-lem {{as the need}} for object views, which are consistent and controllable versions of objects. Multiple views can be made for the same object and customized for the recipients. We implement object views with a JavaScript library that wraps shared objects and interposes on all access attempts. Devel-opers can control the fine-grained behavior of objects with an aspect system that accepts programmatic policies. The security challenge is to fully mediate access to objects shared through a view and prevent privilege escalation. To facilitate simple document sharing, we build a policy system for declaratively <b>defining</b> <b>policies</b> for <b>document</b> ob-ject views. Notably, our document policy system makes it possible to hide elements without breaking document struc-ture invariants. We discuss how object views can be de-ployed in two settings: same-origin sharing with rewriting-based JavaScript isolation systems like Google Caja, and inter-origin sharing between browser frames over a message-passing channel. 1...|$|R

40|$|Scientific {{writings}} and <b>policy</b> <b>documents</b> <b>define</b> the terms nanomaterial and nanoparticle in various ways. This variation is considered problematic because {{the absence of}} a shared definition is understood as potentially hindering nanomaterial knowledge production and regulation. Another view is that the existence of a shared definition may itself cause problems, as rigid definitions arguably exclude important aspects of the studied phenomena. The aim {{of this paper is to}} inform this state of disagreement by providing analytical concepts for a systematic understanding of how, and even whether, nanomaterial and nanoparticle could and should be defined. To do this, we review definitions of nanomaterial and nanoparticle presented in research articles and policy documents. Definitions were identified by first conducting a Scopus search and then tracing cited definitions back to their sources. In total, 36 definitions were identified. Theories of definition from philosophy and linguistics provide analytical guidance for structuring and categorizing the identified definitions, and the main analytical dimensions of the definitions are then identified and discussed. Finally, we propose a framework for understanding the process of defining nanomaterial and nanoparticle. This framework considers both the generality needed for a shared understanding (by suggesting proto-definitions of nanomaterial and nanoparticle) and the level of precision required for different purposes (by allowing for various explications of the proto-definitions) ...|$|R
