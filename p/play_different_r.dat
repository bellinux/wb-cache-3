Between 1997 and 1998 he <b>played</b> for five <b>different</b> <b>Red</b> Sox teams, including two trips to the big club, but showed precious little drive to achieve and was routinely described in the Boston print media as the [...] "mystery man." [...] His departure from that organization was barely noted and entirely unlamented. A year later, he played for the Detroit, Anaheim and Los Angeles minor league organizations, appearing with the Dodgers late in the season. In 2000, he finished 8-3 with a 3.63 ERA for Triple-A Albuquerque Dukes, but this time he did not get another chance at extending his baseball career.|$|R
