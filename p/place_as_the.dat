5|$|Because sugars burn easily {{when exposed}} to flame, the {{handling}} of sugars risks dust explosion. The 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 40, and destroyed most of the refinery, {{was caused by the}} ignition of sugar dust. In its culinary use, sugar that is exposed to a heat source causes caramelization to take <b>place.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> process occurs, volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.|$|E

5|$|For the {{following}} ten days, Georges maintained a general west-northwest track {{for ten days}} due to a persistent mid to upper-level tropospheric ridge.

Easterly wind shear caused disruption of the storms' outflow; however, the center, previously surrounded by two deep areas of convection, was situated underneath one area of thunderstorm activity. By the late morning hours of September17, an eyewall developed within the circulation, indicating that Georges was nearing hurricane-status.|$|E

5|$|Not {{long after}} {{reaching}} its peak intensity, Wipha began to weaken as {{it started to}} interact with the high terrain of Taiwan. Early on September18, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Typhoon Goring as it left their area of responsibility. Later that day, the center of the typhoon passed roughly 130km/h (80mi) north of Taipei, Taiwan. Continued weakening took <b>place</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> storm neared landfall in Mainland China. Around 1800UTC, the eye of Wipha crossed the Chinese coastline near Wenzhou with sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph 10-minute sustained). The JTWC assessed Wipha to have made landfall as a low-end Category3 typhoon with winds of 185km/h (115mph 1-minute sustained). Rapid weakening took <b>place</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> storm moved further inland. The JTWC issued their final advisory on Wipha during the afternoon of September19 as they classified the system as an extratropical cyclone. However, the JMA continued to monitor the system as a tropical depression until September20. At this time, the remnants of Wipha had entered the Yellow Sea and accelerated northeastward towards the Korean Peninsula. The extratropical remnants of Wipha persisted for several more hours before dissipating off the coast of North Korea that afternoon.|$|E

The 6th Massachusetts took about 80 Confederate stragglers prisoner and burned every building they came across along the Somerton Road to deny shelter to any additional Confederate stragglers or deserters.|$|E
