50|$|A <b>procedural</b> <b>issue</b> of {{the early}} Senate was what role the vice {{president}}, the President of the Senate, should have. The first vice president was allowed to craft legislation and participate in debates, but those rights were taken away relatively quickly. John Adams seldom missed a session, but later vice presidents made Senate attendance a rarity. Interestingly, although the founders intended the Senate to be the slower legislative body, {{in the early years}} of the Republic, it was the House that took its time passing legislation. Alexander Hamilton’s Bank of the United States and Assumption Bill (he was then Treasury Secretary), both of which were controversial, easily passed the Senate, only to meet opposition from the House.|$|E

5000|$|But the {{decision}} was limited to a narrow <b>procedural</b> <b>issue</b> and also sent the case back to the 2nd Court of Appeals in New York to directly address {{the constitutionality of the}} FCC's policy. The 2nd Court of Appeals is already on record in its 2007 ruling that it was [...] "skeptical" [...] that the policy could [...] "pass constitutional muster." [...] Scalia said that the looming First Amendment question [...] "will be determined soon enough, perhaps in this very case." [...] The decision provided hints that the court might approach the constitutional question differently. Some dissenting justices and Justice Clarence Thomas, who was in the majority, indicated that they might be receptive to a First Amendment challenge. Thomas, in a concurrence, said he was [...] "open to reconsideration" [...] of the two cases that gave television broadcasters far less First Amendment protection than books, newspapers, cable programs and Web sites have.|$|E

50|$|David Leonard Barnes, an heir of Jenckes and {{well-known}} {{attorney and}} later federal judge, eventually brought suit {{in federal court}} based on diversity jurisdiction asserting that gold or silver payment was required and refusing the paper currency. Despite lack of formal training, West represented himself pro se in the circuit court in June 1791 before Chief Justice John Jay, Associate Justice William Cushing, and Henry Marchant. They rejected his arguments. West then attempted {{to appeal to the}} Supreme Court on a writ of error, attempting to comply with all statutory directions. West was unable to make the journey to Philadelphia to represent himself, so he engaged William Bradford, Jr., Pennsylvania's attorney general, to represent him. On appeal, Barnes focused on the procedural irregularities. Barnes asserted that the writ had been signed and sealed only by the clerk of the circuit court in Rhode Island instead of by the Supreme Court clerk, which he claimed as necessary. This was asserted despite the fact that West would have had to make an arduous journey in 1791 to Philadelphia within ten days to do so. West lost on this <b>procedural</b> <b>issue</b> and was eventually forced to relinquish his farm.|$|E
5000|$|On 7 March 1956, Heinrichsohn {{was sentenced}} to death by a French court in absentia. A formal {{prosecution}} (and conviction) by the Allies prevented any like proceedings in the Federal Republic of Germany. This <b>procedural</b> <b>issue</b> was only cleared in 1975 (based on the reconciliation agreement of 1971), against the resistance of the FDP politician Ernst Achenbach. In 1976, an initiative of the French historian and Holocaust survivor Serge Klarsfeld made public his involvement in the Holocaust. Heinrichsohn responded with a sworn statement to the council, stating that he was not the Gestapo agent known as [...] "Heinrichson". This affidavit was accepted not only in the community but also by the board of the CSU, whose Secretary General Edmund Stoiber did not want to interfere or prejudice a pending investigation. Heinrichsohn was re-elected with 85% of the vote and no opposition on part of the SPD when he ran again for mayor. In 1977, the incriminating documents published by Klarsfeld where discounted by the Oberlandesgericht Bamberg, which declined to strip Heinrichsohn of his law license on the strength of this evidence. In June 1978, Serge Klarsfeld organized a political demonstration of about eighty French in Miltenberg.|$|E
