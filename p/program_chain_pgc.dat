50|$|A DVD {{program is}} an entity in the navigational {{structure}} of a disc's digital data. It is an 8 bit pointer in a <b>program</b> <b>chain</b> (<b>PGC)</b> {{to a group of}} cells (the basic units of video playback). DVD programs define the order in which cells are played back and will reflect user selections for playback.|$|E
50|$|A <b>program</b> <b>chain</b> (<b>PGC)</b> is {{a linear}} {{sequence}} of programs, or 8-bit pointers {{to groups of}} cells. This allows for seamless branching in DVD playback, such as would be required for multi-angle scenes. The first PGC in a DVD title is called the entry PGC. A PGC with no programs is called a dummy PGC. Each PGC has a color palette of 16 colors, recorded in YCbCr format.|$|E
50|$|For instance, {{multi-angle}} scenes can {{be shown}} through a branch in the <b>program</b> <b>chain,</b> as the DVD is being played, to the video cells for the other angles. Subtitles as well are also sometimes run through branches in <b>program</b> <b>chains.</b>|$|R

We show here that plasmacytoid differentiation and the accompanying accumulation of Cμ immunoglobulin mRNA are preceded by a rapid transient increase in {{the expression of the}} proto-oncogenes, c-myc and c-fos. In terminally differentiated cells the level of c-fos mRNA returned to the original basal level whilst c-myc expression remained appreciably higher than in undifferentiated CLL cells.

5000|$|In BASIC <b>programs,</b> <b>chain</b> loading is {{the purview}} of the [...] {{statement}} (or, in Commodore BASIC, the [...] statement), which causes the current program to be terminated and the chained-to program to be loaded and invoked (with, on those dialects of BASIC that support it, an optional parameter specifying the line number from which execution is to commence, rather than the default of the first line of the new program). The common data area varies according to the particular dialect of BASIC that is in use. On BBC BASIC, for example, only a specific subset of all variables are preserved across a CHAIN. On other BASICs, the [...] statement can be used in conjunction with [...] to specify which variables are to be preserved as common data across a chain operation.|$|R

Until now only a few thousands BEBC pictures have been taken in experiments with the existing PS accelerator.

Therefore it is necessary to sophisticate the automatic measuring system using an HPD (a mechanical Flying Spot Digitizer) or to develop new systems; for instance, Erasme recently built at CERN. Through a sophistication of the HPD device, the use of a home-made processor to get track segments {{and the development of a}} new <b>program</b> <b>chain,</b> which allows one to follow spiralizing tracks, a new system has been developed and it allows the automatic processing of BEBC pictures.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this work is to prove the {{effectiveness}} of a fuzzy mathematical programming approach to model a supply chain production planning problem with uncertainty in demand. A fuzzy optimization model that takes into account the lack of knowledge in market demand is developed. This work uses an approach of possibilistic programming. Such an approach makes it possible to model the epistemic uncertainty in demand that could be present in the supply chain production planning problems as triangular fuzzy numbers. The emphasis is on obtaining more knowledge about the impact of fuzzy <b>programming</b> on supply <b>chain</b> planning problems with uncertain demand.

40|$|We {{introduce}} return-oriented programming, {{a technique}} by which an attacker can induce arbitrary {{behavior in a}} program whose control flow he has diverted — without injecting any code. A return-oriented <b>program</b> <b>chains</b> together short instruction sequences already present in a program’s address space, each of which ends in a “return ” instruction. Return-oriented programming defeats the W⊕X protections recently deployed by Microsoft, Intel, and AMD; in this context, {{it can be seen}} as a generalization of traditional return-into-libc attacks. But the threat is more general. Return-oriented programming is readily exploitable on multiple architectures and systems, and bypasses an entire category of security measures: those that seek to prevent malicious computation by preventing the execution of malicious code. To demonstrate the wide applicability of return-oriented programming, we construct a Turingcomplete set of building blocks called gadgets using the standard C library from each of two very different architectures: Linux/x 86 and Solaris/SPARC. To demonstrate the power of returnoriented programming, we present a high-level, general-purpose language for describing returnoriented exploits and a compiler that translates it to gadgets...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} propagating selections into logic programs (i. e., recursive Horn clause programs). In particular, we study the class of <b>chain</b> <b>programs</b> and formalize selection propagation on such a logic program as: the task of finding an equivalent program containing only monadic derived predicates. Selection propagation is always possible for database programs (i. e., first-order formula programs) and is often a desirable optimization. We show {{that the situation is}} qualitatively different for logic programs. We associate a context free language L(H) with every <b>chain</b> <b>program</b> H. We show that, given H, propagating a selection involving some constant is possible iff L(H) is regular and therefore undecidable. We also show that propagating a selection of the form p(X, X) is possible iff L(H) is finite and therefore decidable. We demonstrate the connection of these two cases, respectively, with the weak monadic second-order theory of one successor and with monadic generalized spectra. We further clarify the analogy between <b>chain</b> <b>programs</b> and context-free languages {{from the point of view}} of program equivalence, first-order expressibility over finite structures, and selection propagation heuristics...|$|R
