30|$|It {{has long}} been {{established}} that particulate pollution from road traffic contributes greatly to the degradation of stone outdoors. The presence of DPM has been related to the decay of carbonate [132] and silicate stones [133]. Also outdoors, several corrosion products of copper were identified on statues where soot was also present [134], but no formal relation was established. Although the effects on materials other than stone are less investigated, it can be expected that the reactive components of DPM will also interact with materials, which are typically displayed and used indoors, such as paper, <b>paint</b> <b>and</b> <b>varnishes,</b> or textiles.|$|E
40|$|Safflower (Carthamus tintorius L.) {{belongs to}} the family Compositae or Asteracea. It’s a {{multipurpose}} oilseed crop grown mainly for its high quality edible oil and bird seed. Initially safflower oil {{was used as a}} source of oil for the paint industry, now its edible oil is used for cooking, making margarine and salad oil. Safflower is also grown for its flowers which are used as cut flowers, colouring and flavouring foods, making dyes for the textile industry, livestock forage, vegetable, making herbal teas and medicinal purposes. In China safflower is grown as a medicinal plant for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, male and female sterility, lowering blood cholesterol, release of retained placenta and still birth, induction of labour in expectant women, delayed, heavy and painful menstrual periods, various types of rheumatism (sciatica, thorax, arthritis), respiratory diseases (whooping cough, chronic bronchitis), gastritis, etc. Despite the many uses of safflower, it has remained a minor crop. Therefore, it is essential for the scientific community to carry out research on this crop and popularize it as a commercial crop for development of pharmaceuticals, edible oil, <b>paint</b> <b>and</b> <b>varnishes</b> industry, dye extraction (carthamin), source of α-tocopherol, livestock feed, vegetable and cut flower...|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of the rapid {{industrialization}} of Latin America and the Caribbean {{during the second half of}} this century, exposure to lead has become an increasingly important problem. To obtain an estimate of the magnitude of lead exposure in the region, we carried out a survey and a literature search on potential sources of lead exposure and on blood lead concentrations. Sixteen out of 18 Latin American and 2 out of 10 Caribbean countries responded to the survey. Lead in gasoline remains a major problem, although the lead content has decreased in many countries in the last few years. The impact of leaded fuel is more important in urban settings, given their high vehicular density. Seventy-five percent of the population of the region lives in urban areas, and children younger than 15 years of age, the most susceptible group, comprise 30 % of the population. Other sources of lead exposure identified in the region included industrial emissions, battery recycling, <b>paint</b> <b>and</b> <b>varnishes,</b> and contaminated food and water. Lead is recognized as a priority problem by national authorities in 72 % of the countries that responded to the survey, and in 50 % of the countries some legislation exists to regulate the lead content in certain products. However, compliance is low. There is an urgent need for a broad-based coalition between policy makers, industry, workers, unions, health care providers, and the community to take actions to reduce environmental and occupational lead exposures in all the Latin American and Caribbean countries...|$|E
