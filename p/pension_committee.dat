5|$|Clint Benedict was {{the first}} goaltender to wear facial protection, donning it in 1930 to protect a broken nose. He quickly {{abandoned}} his mask as its design interfered with his vision. Twenty-nine years later, on November 1, 1959, {{in a game against}} New York Rangers Jacques Plante made the goaltender mask a permanent fixture in hockey. The first players' union was formed February 12, 1957 by Red Wings player Ted Lindsay who had sat {{on the board of the}} NHL's Pension Society since 1952. Lindsay and his fellow players were upset by the league's refusal to let them view the books related to the pension fund. The league claimed that it could not contribute more than it did but the players on the <b>Pension</b> <b>Committee</b> suspected otherwise. The idea quickly gained popularity and when the union's founding was announced publicly, nearly every NHL player had signed up. Led by Alan Eagleson, the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) was formed in 1967 and it quickly received acceptance from the owners.|$|E

He was made deacon in 1880, and ordained priest in 1881 by Bishop Ryan for Ripon. He was curate of Kirkburton from 1880 to 1882. On Tuesday 25 July 1882 the Bishop of Ripon instituted Rev. John Leech to the vicarage of Thurstonland, and he stayed until 1906. His living was worth £180 and a house, with a parish population of 997. In October 1886, along with the whole of the clergy in the rural deanery, all in vestments, Leech attended a dedication festival at the jubilee of the restoration of St Peter's, Huddersfield Parish Church. On Wednesday 10 August 1887 he preached a sermon promoting evangelicalism at St Andrew's Church, Huddersfield, as part of the celebrations on the 17th anniversary of the consecration of the church. In June 1889 he preached the evening sermon at the Meltham Church Sunday School Anniversary, that is, sermons to raise collections on behalf of the Sunday schools. There was choral music, a crowded church and a collection of £42 14s 10d. On the evening of Monday 20 January 1890, John Leech chaired a debate in which [...] "good temper and kindly feeling prevailed" [...] at the National School, New Mill, on the question, [...] "Is the union between Church and State beneficial?" [...] There was much discussion, but the result was affirmative. In July 1906 Leech was appointed vicar of the Church of St John the Evangelist, Golcar, Huddersfield, with a living of £300 per year and a house; he remained in this position until 1931. During his time in Golcar, the value of the living rose from £300 to £400, while the parish population rose from 9,261 to 10,360. He was chaplain to the 7th (Colne Valley) Battalion West Riding Territorial Regiment, and was a founder member of both the Golcar Old Age <b>Pension</b> <b>Committee,</b> and of the Golcar District Association Committee. He retired in April 1931 due to poor health, and died aged 76 years on 3 November 1932 at The Ridings, Thongsbridge.|$|E
