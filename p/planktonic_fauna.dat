They begin to differentiate from lower latitude faunas by the early late Paleocene when large morozovellids disappear from the region and cool deep-water-dwelling Globorotaloides appear much earlier than at lower latitudes. By early Eocene time large morozovellids immigrate into the subantarctic area during the warmest episode of the entire Eocene.

A new warming episode during the late Eocene is marked by the immigration of Globigerinatheka luterbacheri into the subantarctic region. The cooling trend during the late Eocene causes a progressive decrease in species richness, which only sporadically is less than 10 species.

Aplanktonic zones reflect salinities in the Red Sea in excess of the lethal 49 p. s. u. limit, caused by reduced exchange transport through the Strait of Bab el Mandab due to glacial sea-level lowering. Concerning the last glacial cycle, aplanktonic conditions began at 39 ka BP in the north, where salinities eventually reached 55 – 57 p. s. u. Paradoxically, <b>planktonic</b> <b>faunas</b> are reported to have survived the last glacial maximum in the northern Gulf of Aqaba, suggesting a poorly understood freshwater dilution at that time. Aplanktonic conditions (S? 49 p. s. u.) reached the south-central Red Sea by 22 ka BP, while <b>planktonic</b> foraminiferal <b>faunas</b> continued, albeit in very low abundances and limited diversity (S? 45 p. s. u.), in the southernmost Red Sea. During marine isotope stage (MIS) 6, the 49 p. s. u. isohaline appears to have resided in the central Red Sea, between cores KL 11 and MD 921017. We observe a systematic sequence of species disappearances before all glacial maxima of the last 500 kyr. Absence of a logical relationship with sea levels suggests that the disappearance sequences are not related to a general salinity increase. Instead, we argue that the sequences were driven by complex reorganisations in hydrography (stratification), productivity (food availability) and subsurface oxygenation (reproduction-habitats). The onset is marked by dramatic basin-wide expansion of conditions that today are restricted to only the southern Red Sea, suggesting an expansion of the dominance of NE monsoonal circulation over the entire Red Sea. This expansion occurred 15 or more kyr before the aplanktonic zones of MIS- 12, 6 and 2, and also before MIS- 10 and 8, which never reach the aplanktonic stage. Regarding the last glacial cycle, this event occurred as early as 75 ka BP (MIS- 4 / 5 boundary). After this major climatic reorganisation, we reconstruct progressive intensification of the new conditions, especially marked by northward expansion and intensification of the subsurface oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). During the last glacial cycle, a shallow and very distinct OMZ affected the central Red Sea as early as 68 ka BP, and the north as late as 55 ka BP. The OMZ expansion/intensification appears to have been interrupted by episodes of increased ventilation...|$|R

The record from the late Quaternary (< 0. 9 Ma) shows large amplitudes and high frequencies in oxygen isotopic variation. Prior to 0. 9 Ma the isotopic variability record is reduced in amplitude (but not in frequency) compared with the late Quaternary, suggesting lower ice-volume and climatic fluctuations, and higher average eustatic sea level. Left-coiling (L, polar) Neogloboquadrinapachyderma were not found in samples between 1. 0 and 2. 2 Ma, indicating less influence of polar front migrations in the Northeast Atlantic.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Of {{the bottom}} {{material}} {{collected by the}} Snellius-Expedition 78 samples contained Foraminifera. Many of these samples were extremely small, since they were gathered by means of piston core samplers; some were larger, as they were collected {{by means of a}} dredge; others were samples in shallow water at beaches or reefs. A l l samples were fixed in formaldehyde, so that after the 40 years they remained in store before they were studied, rests of protoplasma were seldom preserved. The numerous plankton samples, preserved in formaldehyde or in alcohol, did note contain planktonic Foraminifera; obviously the small amount of CaC 03 in the samples caused the dissolution of the tests. The planktonic Foraminifera are not described here, as planktonic forms of the Pacific Ocean were already studied by Parker (1962) and by Todd (1965).

40|$|The 100 ka {{rhythm of}} orbital {{eccentricity}} has dominated large-amplitude climatic {{variations in the}} high-latitude North Atlantic during the Brunhes magnetic chron (0 - 0. 735 Ma BP). Earlier, during the Matuyama chron (0. 735 - 2. 47 Ma BP), climatic variations in this region were lower in amplitude and concentrated mainly at the 41 ka rhythm of orbital obliquity. These rhythmic climatic responses to orbital forcing are evident both in stable isotopic (δ 18 O) indicators of ice volume or temperature and in biotic and lithologic indicators of local North Atlantic surfaceocean variability. The synchronous responses of these indicators are consistent with results from atmospheric general circulation models showing that the North American ice sheet directly controls North Atlantic surface-ocean responses via strong cold winds that are generated on the northern ice-sheet flanks and blow out across the ocean, chilling its surface. Before 2. 47 Ma BP, smaller-scale quasiperiodic oscillations of the <b>planktonic</b> <b>fauna</b> and flora occurred, but the cause of these variations {{in the absence of}} significant ice sheets is unclear...|$|E
40|$|We drilled 13 {{holes on}} Ocean Drilling Program Leg 115 in the Indian Ocean and {{recovered}} Paleogene sediments that consisted primarily of pelagic components. Planktonic foraminifer assemblages displayed high diversity throughout the Paleogene {{from the late}} Paleocene to the Oligocene/Miocene boundary and consist of predominantly warm-water species. Faunas of middle Eocene age are remarkably well represented. Biostratigraphic assignment was, however, very difficult because of the turbiditic character {{of most of the}} Paleogene sediments. Reworking is a constant feature of the middle Eocene through early Oligocene <b>planktonic</b> <b>faunas,</b> with reworked faunas frequently overwhelming the younger ones. Preservation within turbidites ranges from excellent to very poor to total destruction of planktonic foraminifers. A major dissolution episode is recorded in the interval that spans most of the late Eocene through the early Oligocene, especially at the deeper sites where the source area was probably well below the lysocline. Redeposition decreases markedly by the mid-Oligocene, but it is only by late Oligocene Zone P 22 that normal sedimentation resumes and/or redeposition decreases even at the most affected sites (such as Hole 709 C). Comparison with other sites drilled previously in the Indian Ocean reveals that mixed assemblages were already known for sediments from the Mascarene Plateau-Seychelles Bank and surrounding basins during that time span. Because of the disturbances that characterize Paleogene deposits, hiatuses are difficult to detect; nevertheless, a hiatus of less local importance, spanning Subzone P 21 b, was detected in three holes at different water depths...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of planktonic and benthic foraminifers was examined in some hundred core-tops from the Angola Basin, mainly from depths below 2000 metres. A number of biofacies have been discriminated in the <b>planktonic</b> <b>faunas</b> on the sea-floor and these show a clear {{relation with the}} hydrography of the (near-) surface waters. Species distribution can generally be described satisfactorily in terms of surface-water temperature and fertility. However, if the thermocline reaches into the photic zone, faunas {{different from those of}} the surface-mixed layer are found at the top of the thermocline. The faunal differences between the top of the thermocline and the surface-water can not simply be attributed to differences in temperature and fertility. We suppose that some species are specifically linked up with a steep thermal gradient, whereas others can flourish in thermally homogeneous water only. The deep-sea benthic foraminiferal faunas vary primarily with depth. In addition there appear to be differences between the area along the African continent and areas far away from the continent. Faunal contrasts are found also within these areas. The lateral differences must be due to variations in sediment-related parameters and it is suggested that the amount of organic matter at and in the bottom plays a crucial role. Depth-related changes in the faunas are thought to be controlled by vertical gradients in bottom-water temperature and in the amount of organic matter arriving at the bottom. It should be mentioned that our results do not support the widely accepted idea that there is a relation between Nuttallides umboniferus and Antarctic Bottom Water. In a more general sense, we contend that fauna/water-mass relations are actually to be reduced to relations between fauna and bottomwater temperature. Late Quaternary faunal change was studied in five piston-cores from depths between 2000 and 4000 metres in the marginal area of the north-eastern Angola Basin. A climate stratigraphy was established for the last 150, 000 years on the basis of regional changes in the <b>planktonic</b> foraminiferal <b>faunas.</b> The regional changes in the <b>planktonic</b> <b>faunas</b> are thought to be essentially due to variations in cold-water advection by the Benguela Current and in intensity of equatorial divergence processes. These two factors do not only influence the temperature of the surface-water, but also control the degree to which the photic layer is thermally stratified. It is concluded that the primary production of the photic layer was much higher during cold than during warm climatic stages. The influence of the Benguela Current has been stronger during cold than during warm climatic phases and reached a maximum in isotope stage 4. Equatorial divergence was intense during isotope stages 2 and 3 and weak during stage 4, substage 5 e and periods of deglaciation. It is suggested that intensification of the Benguela Current and intensification of equatorial divergence have generally been out of phase. Changes in wind direction could offer an explanation for this inverse relation. Consistent differences between warm and cold climatic stages show up also in the benthic faunas. In most cores, distinction must be made between an autochthonous and an allochthonous faunal signal. At depths beteen 2700 and 3500 metres in the area north of the Zaire deep-sea fan, the contribution of allochthonous elements reaches maxima in cold climatic stages. This suggests increased down-slope transport during periods of low sea-level stands. Climate related changes in the frequencies of autochthonous species are recognized at all sites and are to be ascribed primarily to variation in the amount of organic matter at and in the bottom. The amount of organic matter must have been larger in cold than in warm climatic intervals. This is to be attributed mainly to increased primary production of the surface-waters during cold climatic periods. It is further suggested that bottom-water temperatures have varied in the Angola Basin over the past 150, 000 years. Variation in bottom-water temperature seems only partially linked up with climatic change. At great depth, bottom waters were colder than today during isotope stages 2 and 4 and the middle of stage 5. Interpretation of glacial/interglacial differences in benthic deep-sea faunas reported in the literature for the NW Atlantic Ocean and Southern Ocean, indicates that these differences may also be due to variation in the organic matter content of the sediments. Again, increased primary production during cold climatic periods seems likely...|$|R

40|$|A {{synthesis}} {{of data on}} abundance and biomass of zooplankton in the Eastern Mediterranean (EMED) and the Black Sea shows major differences in the composition and structure of pelagic communities in the two basins. Few Mediterranean planktonic animals have invaded and acclimatised in the Black Sea. The great bulk of Black Sea species is represented by coastal inhabitants that spread throughout the whole basin. This process has been called “neritization” of the Black Sea fauna. Peculiarities in zooplankton assemblages of the Black Sea have been further strengthened {{over the last few}} decades due to increasing eutrophication and the massive invasion of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi. The relative contribution of copepods, cladocerans, chaetognaths, and appendicularians to total zooplankton biomass has notably decreased, whereas gelatinous groups (mainly represented by Mnemiopsis and Aurelia aurita) contributed up to 99 % of total wet weight in 1995 in the Black Sea. The basic features of <b>planktonic</b> <b>fauna</b> in the Black Sea are mainly due do the geo-morphological characters of the basin and the limited exchanges with the EMED, that are confined to the surface-subsurface layers in the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits.

40|$|International audienceThe copepod Calanus glacialis is {{endemic to}} the Arctic Ocean and {{peripheral}} seas and forms {{a key component}} of the Arctic marine ecosystems. It is the major contributor to zooplankton biomass, a predominant grazer, and an important prey for seabirds, and fish. As for a planktonic species, its dispersal is expected to be widespread and mediated by ocean currents. However, complex circulation patterns and the existence of semi-enclosed fjords and seas in the Arctic can be hypothesized to influence the population genetic structure of this species. In this study, we aimed to infer patterns of connectivity between populations of C. glacialis distributed around the Arctic and across putative barriers formed by oceanographic currents and semi-enclosed fjords and seas. To achieve this, we used 11 polymorphic microsatellite loci to genotype 189 individuals from 7 locations: Svalbard fjords (Kongsfjorden, Hornsund, Isfjorden, Rijpfjorden, and Storfjorden), White Sea, and Amundsen Gulf, thus providing greater genetic resolution over a larger biogeographical scale than in previous studies. The results revealed a lack of structure among all seven locations around the Arctic, indicating a panmictic population with large-scale gene flow.

40|$|Leg 87 {{investigated}} {{two sites}} in the Nankai Trough, off southeastern Japan, {{and one in the}} Japan Trench, off northeastern Japan. Several holes at the Nankai Trough sites penetrated mostly Quaternary interbedded sandy turbidites and hemipelagic mud. Foraminifers are common only in certain turbidite sands because both sites are at or just below the carbonate compensation depth. The planktonic assemblages from these sandy layers consist of mixed cool-temperate and warm-water species, and include both solution-resistant and solution-prone species. The benthic assemblages from these same layers are composed of mixtures of shelf to abyssal species. The northward-flowing Kuroshio is important in producing the mixed <b>planktonic</b> <b>faunas,</b> whereas turbidity currents are the primary agents in mixing benthic faunas and in the rapid burial of both planktonic and benthic foraminifers, which protects them from solution. Interbedded hemipelagic muds are barren or contain sparse faunas. Hole 582 B penetrated through the trench-fill deposits into hemipelagic sediments that originated in the Shikoku Basin. These muds contain a dissolution facies of solution-resistant planktonic species, partially dissolved tests, and deep bathyal benthic species. Drilling at Site 584, on the landward midslope of the Japan Trench, penetrated a section of dominantly diatomaceous mudstone. This section contains a meager Pliocene calcareous fauna in its upper third and a nearly monospecific assemblage of Martinottiella communis in the lower two-thirds. Diatom biostratigraphy indicates that this change in assemblages occurs near the Miocene/Pliocene boundary. Similar biofacies changes are observed in neighboring sections drilled during Legs 56 and 57. The change from agglutinated to calcareous faunas is probably related to a relative drop in the carbonate compensation depth {{at the end of the}} Miocene...|$|R
40|$|Limestone from Unit VI (857. 1 - 859. 15 meters below seafloor) {{collected}} at Site 1118 contains a <b>planktonic</b> foraminiferal <b>fauna</b> indicating a latest Miocene to early Pliocene age. Globorotalia tumida is recorded in Sample 180 - 1118 A- 68 R- 4, 46 - 48 cm, indicating an early Pliocene (N 18) age {{at this level}} (J. Resig, pers. comm., 2000). Based on their known range in the western Papuan Basin, the presence of (rare) Lepidocyclina and common Amphistegina in some samples suggests that abundant shallow-water bioclastic debris present in these limestones may be reworked from older, possibly middle or early late Miocene sediments. Four samples were selected for whole-rock strontium isotopic analysis to further investigate this possibility. A petrographic examination of samples analyzed was also conducted...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of micropaleontological research of foraminiferal fauna from Paleogene sediments in the basins on the territory of the Vardar zone in the Republic of Macedonia, which are very important in solving the stratigraphy of the basins. The studied micropalaeontological material was obtained from 131 samples coming from the upper flysh unit and the unit of yellow sandstones of 11 outcrop sections belonging to four sedimentary basins: Skopje-Kumanovo, Tikvesh, Ovche Pole and Valandovo-Gevgelija basin in the Vardar Zone. The biostratigraphic significance of the foraminiferal fauna in the Paleogene sediments is followed by stratigraphic distribution of 75 species of benthic and <b>planktonic</b> foraminiferal <b>fauna,</b> belonging to 43 genera and 30 families. Systematic classification of the foraminiferal fauna was done after Loeblich and Tappan (1988) ...|$|R
40|$|We studied copepod assemblages in the {{northern}} South China Sea during October 2004. A total of 78 copepod species was identified from 24 families and 42 genera that include the four orders Calanoida, Cyclopoida, Harpacticoida, and Poecilostomatoida. The high copepod diversity {{in the study area}} may mainly be caused by both the year-round Kuroshio Current intrusion and the SW monsoon, prevailing in the South China Sea during summer. Water currents in the region transport marine <b>planktonic</b> <b>fauna,</b> that comprises predominantly Copepoda from subtropical and tropical water masses. Calanus sinicus did not appear, indicating that there was no cold water mass intrusion in that area during October 2004. Clansocalanus furcatus and C. arcuicornis were most dominant, occurring in 27 of a total of 28 samples (occurrence rate (OR) : 96. 43 %). Thirteen copepod species were found once in all samples. The three most dominant copepods considering all samples were Clausocalanus furcatus (RA: 15. 32 %), C. arcuicornis (RA 13. 52 %), and Paracalanus nanus (RA: 9. 28 %). Most species of copepods performed a common diel vertical migration, descending during daytime and ascending at night at different rates to different depth zones. There were smaller numbers of species and lower diversity indices in surface waters (1 - 2 m depth) as compared to depths below 50 m...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-resolution}} piston core, ENAM 93 - 21, from a {{water depth}} of 1020 m near the Faeroe-Shetland Channel is investigated for variations in magnetic susceptibility, surface oxygen isotopes, grain size distribution, content of ice-rafted detritus (IRD), {{and distribution of}} planktonic and benthic foraminifera. The core, covering the last 58, 000 years, is correlated with the Greenland ice cores and compared with paleorecords from the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean. All fifteen Dansgaard-Oeschger climatic cycles recognized from the investigated time period in the Greenland ice cores {{have been identified in}} the ENAM 93 - 21 core. Each cycle is subdivided into three intervals on the basis of characteristic benthic and planktonic faunas. Interstadial intervals contain a relatively warm <b>planktonic</b> <b>fauna</b> and a benthic fauna similar to the modern fauna in the Norwegian Sea. This indicates thermohaline convection as at present, with a significant contribution of deep water to the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). Transitional cooling intervals are characterized by more cold water planktonic foraminfera and ice-related benthic species. The benthic fauna signifies restricted bottom water conditions and a reduced contribution to the NADW. The peak abundance of N. pachyderma (s.) and the coldest surface water conditions are found in the stadial intervals. The benthic fauna is dominated by species with an association to Atlantic Intermediate Water, suggesting an increased Atlantic influence in the Norwegian Sea, and there was probably no contribution to the NADW through the Faeroe-Shetland Channel. The three different modes of circulation can be correlated to paleoceanographic events in the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean...|$|E
40|$|The Czorsztyn Succession is the shallowest Pienidic {{unit of the}} West Carpathian Pieniny Klippen Belt. After the Valanginian, a hiatus {{encompassing}} {{almost the}} whole Hauterivian, Barremian and Aptian occurred in this unit. The Tithonian-Lower Cretaceous limestones are overlain by pelagic Albian-Cenomanian marlstones, marly limestones and cherts (Chmielowa and Pomiedznik Formations). The nature of this hiatus was so far unclear, either representing a submarine non-deposition and erosion, or subaerial exposure. The paper brings provides a summary of data collected from the literature and new data from 5 re-examined sites and 5 new sites: Dolný Mlyn, Vršatec (3 sites), Horné Sŕnie, Lednica, Jarabina, Kamenica (all Slovakia), Czerwona Skała Klippe (Poland) and Vilki Dil (Ukraine). At two sites, the Albian marlstones and limestones overlie rocks older than Tithonian or Neocomian. In Jarabina, the Barremian-Aptian erosion reached the level of Kimmeridgian red micritic limestones, though clasts of limestones with "filamentous" microfacies indicate that Bathonian-Callovian limestones were also exposed and eroded. At Horné Sŕnie, the Albian deposits overlie Bajocian crinoidal limestones. The Bathonian to Hauterivian sediments are missing, which indicates that {{this part of the}} Czorsztyn sedimentary area experienced the deepest erosion. Unequivocal indicators of subaerial exposure and karstification, e. g. karren landform with vertical drainage grooves, small cavities in the bottom rock filled with younger sediment, bizarre fractures and veinlets filled with calcite, were revealed mainly at Horné Sŕnie and Lednica sites. The emersion was followed by pelagic of pelagic Albian marlstones and limestones. At this time, the palaeokarst surface was bored by bivalves and encrusted by deep-water Fe-Mn to phosphatic stromatolites. This suggests a very rapid relative sea-level rise, causing marine ingression. There were two transgression pulses in the Late Aptian and Albian, separated by a temporary emersion and karstification. The Upper Aptian sediments are still organodetrital with crinoids and other benthic fauna, whereas those of the Albian contain exclusively pelagic <b>planktonic</b> <b>fauna...</b>|$|E
40|$|Pliocene and Pleistocene planktonic foraminiferal {{biogeography}} and paleoceanography {{have been}} examined in Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) sites of the Panama Basin (Pacific Ocean) and Colombian and Venezuelan Basins (Atlantic Ocean) to determine {{the timing of the}} isolation of Atlantic and Pacific tropical <b>planktonic</b> <b>faunas</b> resulting from the development of the Central American isthmus. Previous studies have suggested a late Miocene to middle Pliocene occurrence of this event. The Panama Basin (DSDP site 157) and the Colombian Basin (DSDP site 154 A) share two early Pliocene biogeographic events: (1) great abundance of sinistral coiling Neogloboquadrina pachyderma at 4. 3 m. y. ago at site 157 and 0. 7 m. y. later at site 154 A, and (2) a sinistral-to-dextral change in the coiling-direction preference in Pulleniatina 3. 5 m. y. ago at both locations. Identification of these events farther to the east in the Venezuelan Basin (DSDP site 148) is complicated by insufficient lower Pliocene core recovery, but abundant sinistral N. pachydcrma appear to have extended far to the east in the Caribbean 3. 6 m. y. ago; perhaps the early Pliocene abundance of this form is not indicative of cool water. The coiling-direction history and stratigraphic ranges of Pulleniatina became different in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans during the early Pliocene; this is inferred to result from geographic isolation of the assemblages. Saito (1976) used the temporary disappearance of this genus from Atlantic waters at 3. 5 m. y. ago to mark the closure of the Isthmus of Panama, but I show that in the Colombian Basin (site 154 A) its disappearance was closer to 3. 1 m. y. ago. This suggests the possibility of surface-water communication between the Atlantic and Pacific until that time...|$|R
40|$|Pluri-annual proxy {{records of}} marine {{sediment}} cores from the Tagus Prodelta off Lisbon, Portugal, have been generated to {{gain insight into}} the climatic and hydrographic changes in the area during the twentieth century. The study includes benthic and <b>planktonic</b> foraminiferal <b>faunas</b> and the stable isotopic composition of one benthic (Uvigerina celtica) and two planktonic (Globigerina bulloides and Globorotalia inflata) foraminiferal species. Sea bottom and surface water temperatures were estimated based on the d 18 O values of these species and compared with instrumental data. The foraminiferal fauna and the isotope-based temperature record indicate increasing temperatures throughout the last century. The immigration of a new species, Saidovina karreriana, to the area around 100 years ago indicates changes in the trophic conditions and water mass properties, which are probably at least partly due to anthropogenic pollution...|$|R
40|$|The <b>planktonic</b> foraminiferal <b>fauna</b> was {{studied in}} 206 samples {{gathered}} by the Royal Research Ship Discovery II at the 90 °E meridian of longitude between the equator and the coast of Antarctica. Samples were collected throughout the water column from 1500 to 0 m. Twenty-seven species were recognized, and their horizontal and vertical distributions were established. Five types of surface water masses were distinguished {{on the basis of}} differences in foraminiferal fauna, and the geographical positions of these water masses were determined and plotted. It was found that differences exist between the geographic positions of the hydrological fronts established by means of temperature and salinity data, and those determined by means of foraminiferological data. Explanations for these discrepancies are given. The percentage of empty shells with respect to the total number of foraminiferal shells at different depths was calculated. ...|$|R
