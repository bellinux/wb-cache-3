5|$|The {{packaging}} {{has undergone}} many changes since its inception. Unlike McDonald's, the company {{never used the}} clamshell style box made of Styrofoam, so when the environmental concerns over Styrofoam {{came to a head}} in the late 1980s, the company was able to tout its use of <b>paperboard</b> boxes for its sandwiches. To cut back on the amount of paper that the company used, the <b>paperboard</b> box was fully eliminated in 1991 and was replaced with waxed paper. For a short time in 2002, the company used a gold-toned, aluminum foil wrapping for the sandwich as part of the 45th anniversary of the sandwich. The packaging was changed again in 2012 when the company moved to half wrapped sandwich packaged in a paper board box.|$|E
25|$|A carton is {{the name}} of certain types of {{containers}} typically made from <b>paperboard</b> or cardboard. Many types of cartons are used in food packaging. Sometimes a carton is also called a box. The history of the carton goes as far back as 1879 when it was invented in a Brooklyn, New York factory. The inventor of the folded carton was Robert Gair. He cast a die-ruled, cut, and scored <b>paperboard</b> into a single impression of a folded carton. By 1896, the National Biscuit Company was the first to use cartons to package crackers.|$|E

25|$|There is {{potential}} of nanocellulose {{applications in the}} area of paper and <b>paperboard</b> manufacture. Nanocelluloses are expected to enhance the fiber-fiber bond strength and, hence, have a strong reinforcement effect on paper materials. Nanocellulose may be useful as a barrier in grease-proof type of papers and as a wet-end additive to enhance retention, dry and wet strength in commodity type of paper and board products. It has been shown that applying CNF as a coating material on the surface of paper and <b>paperboard</b> improves the barrier properties, especially air resistance. It also enhances the structure properties of paperboards (smoother surface).|$|E

25|$|As with {{environmental}} economics, {{care must be}} taken to ensure a complete view of the costs and benefits involved. For example, <b>paperboard</b> packaging for food products is more easily recycled than most plastic, but is heavier to ship and may result in more waste from spoilage.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{consumer}} products recycled include aluminium such as beverages cans, copper such as wire, steel from food and aerosol cans, old steel furnishings or equipment, rubber tyres, polyethylene and PET bottles, glass bottles and jars, <b>paperboard</b> cartons, newspapers, magazines and light paper, and corrugated fiberboard boxes.|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of raw material at Blue Brick in Singapore is costly {{as the company}} is forced to pay for external storage when the ports' time allowance runs out. A new ordering policy of (Q, R) continuous review model with forecast demand is developed to reduce inventory in the external warehouse. The policy parameters of four most commonly used <b>paperboards</b> are determined and simulations based on historical demand data are run to evaluate the policy. A simulation with Crystal Ball is also run to prove {{the efficacy of the}} (Q, R) method. Both the theoretical and simulation results suggest that the new ordering policy satisfies the stock-out requirement and ports' inventory day requirement. Thus Blue Brick can eliminate the four common paperboards' inventory in the external warehouse. Moreover if the forecast errors of other <b>paperboards</b> have the same levels as the ones of the four common <b>paperboards,</b> Blue Brick could eliminate all the inventories in the external warehouse. by Dafei Han.

50|$|Corrugated {{fiberboard}} is {{a combination}} of <b>paperboards,</b> usually two flat liners and one inner fluted corrugated medium.

25|$|Wood {{is used in}} {{thousands}} of ways, e.g. buildings, furniture, boats, airplanes, wagons, car parts, musical instruments, sports equipment, railroad ties, utility poles, fence posts, pilings, toothpicks, matches, plywood, coffins, shingles, barrel staves, toys, tool handles, picture frames, veneer, charcoal and firewood. Wood pulp is widely used to make paper, <b>paperboard,</b> cellulose sponges, cellophane and some important plastics and textiles, such as cellulose acetate and rayon. Bamboo stems also have hundreds of uses, including paper, buildings, furniture, boats, musical instruments, fishing poles, water pipes, plant stakes, and scaffolding. Trunks of palm trees and tree ferns are often used for building. Stems of Reed are an important building material for use in thatching in some areas.|$|E

The US single-serving size is usually the half-pint (about 240 mL). Less frequently, dairies deliver milk directly to consumers, from coolers filled with glass bottles which are typically half-gallon sized and returned for reuse. Some convenience store chains in the United States (such as Kwik Trip in the Midwest) sell milk in half-gallon bags, while another rectangular cube gallon container design used for easy stacking in shipping and displaying is used by warehouse clubs such as Costco and Sam's Club, along with some Wal-Mart stores.|$|E

500|$|In August, Wood {{was driven}} {{around the town}} by a young painter from Eldon, John Sharp, looking for inspiration. Sharp's brother {{suggested}} in 1973 that it was on this drive that Wood first sketched {{the house on the}} back of an envelope. Wood did not immediately regard the house as beautiful, but he did find it captivating. His earliest biographer, Darrell Garwood, noted that Wood [...] "thought it a form of borrowed pretentiousness, a structural absurdity, to put a Gothic-style window in such a flimsy frame house." [...] At the time, Wood classified it as one of the [...] "cardboardy [...] frame houses on Iowa farms" [...] and considered it [...] "very paintable." [...] After obtaining the permission of the Jones family, Wood made a sketch the next day in oil on <b>paperboard</b> from the house's front yard. This sketch displayed a steeper roof and a longer window with a more pronounced ogive than the actual house, features which eventually adorned the final work; however, Wood did not add figures to the sketch until he returned to Cedar Rapids. He would not return to Eldon again before his death in 1942, although he did request a photograph of the home to complete his painting.|$|E

40|$|Rice straw {{cellulosic}} ethanol fermentation waste (CEFW) {{and municipal}} solid waste derived fiber (MSWF) were used as alternative fibers for recycled paper making. The fibers were mixed with old newspaper (ONP) fiber at different mass ratios to produce standard recycled papers and <b>paperboards.</b> A “green” adhesive binder derived from kraft black liquor (BLDB) was used to improve the physical properties of the waste-derived paper products. The values of these properties increased linearly with increasing average fiber lengths, regardless {{of the type of}} fiber used in the products. BLDB improved the physical properties of the products by 50 % for papers and 85 % for <b>paperboards,</b> and the performance of this binder was comparable to a commercial urea formaldehyde resin binder. Thermal pressing, however, did not improve the physical properties of the binder-enhanced paper products. With the addition of the adhesive binder, CEFW and MSWF showed reasonable substitution potential for ONP fiber by providing suitable tensile and bursting strength in the recycled paper products. The critical fiber length, which produced the minimum strength properties for the recycled paper products, was approximately 1020 µm. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

Scottish-born Robert Gair invented the pre-cut <b>paperboard</b> box in 1890—flat pieces manufactured in bulk that folded into boxes. Gair's invention came about {{as a result of an}} accident: as a Brooklyn printer and paper-bag maker during the 1870s, he was once printing an order of seed bags, and the metal ruler, normally used to crease bags, shifted in position and cut them. Gair discovered that by cutting and creasing in one operation he could make prefabricated <b>paperboard</b> boxes.|$|E
