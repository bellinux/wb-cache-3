Temporary staining may develop after use, but it will fade after normal washing. These are either applied with hands, <b>paint</b> <b>brush,</b> and synthetic sponges or natural sea sponge, or alternatively with an airbrush.|$|E

25|$|A rather unusual case, {{which might}} not qualify as vandalism, {{occurred}} in 1908. An exhibition {{was set up}} for May of that year with paintings by Claude Monet, which had already been praised by critics and were estimated at $100,000 (1908 prices). Despite this, Monet decided {{that he was not}} satisfied with his work and in a sudden move destroyed all the paintings with a knife and a <b>paint</b> <b>brush.</b>|$|E

25|$|Potassium {{ferrocyanide}} is used {{to achieve}} a blue color on cast bronze sculptures during the final finishing stage of the sculpture. On its own, it will produce a very dark shade of blue and is often mixed with other chemicals to achieve the desired tint and hue. It is applied using a torch and <b>paint</b> <b>brush</b> while wearing the standard safety equipment used for any patina application: rubber gloves, safety glasses, and a respirator. The actual amount of cyanide in the mixture varies according to the recipes used by each foundry.|$|E

25|$|Watteau alarmed {{his friends}} by a {{carelessness}} {{about his future}} and financial security, as if foreseeing he would not live for long. In fact he had been sickly and physically fragile since childhood. In 1720, he travelled to London, England, to consult Dr. Richard Mead, {{one of the most}} fashionable physicians of his time and an admirer of Watteau's work. However, London's damp and smoky air offset any benefits of Dr. Mead's wholesome food and medicines. Watteau returned to France and spent his last few months on the estate of his patron, Abbé Haranger, where he died in 1721, perhaps from tuberculous laryngitis, at the age of 36. The Abbé said Watteau was semi-conscious and mute during his final days, clutching a <b>paint</b> <b>brush</b> and painting imaginary paintings in the air.|$|E
500|$|Works in the Brushstrokes series depict brushstrokes {{as their}} subject. [...] However, rather than present {{the use of}} the {{delicate}} artist <b>paint</b> <b>brush,</b> Lichtenstein created the strokes of the broad house-painter's brush. His works both turned a mundane household task into a planned artistic operation and made a time-consuming task appear as if it were produced mechanically in an instant. [...] The Brushstroke series paintings [...] "...contain the clear outline, process colors, and Benday-dot screen of the comic strip, but like the landscapes, they exchew narrative in favor of reducing a subject (in this case, painting) to its most basic symbol (the brushstroke)." [...] The satirical element of the Brushstroke is obvious to many because it is a calculated presentation of the spontaneous gestural works of its day.|$|E
500|$|Teddy is Mr. Bean's {{teddy bear}} and perhaps Mr. Bean's best friend. The little brown bear is a knitted oddity with button eyes and sausage-shaped limbs, which {{invariably}} end up broken in half or in various other states of destruction and disfiguration. Although Teddy is inanimate, Mr. Bean often pretends it is alive. For example, when Mr. Bean hypnotises Teddy, he snaps {{his fingers and}} the bear's head falls backwards {{as if it had}} fallen asleep instantly (Bean used his finger to prop Teddy's head up). Mr. Bean behaves as if the bear is real, buying it a Christmas present or trying not to wake it in the mornings. The bear is often privy to Mr. Bean's various schemes and doubles as a tool or other items in emergencies; it has been decapitated ("Mr. Bean in Room 426"), used as his <b>paint</b> <b>brush</b> ("Do-It-Yourself Mr. Bean"), and shrunk in the wash ("Tee Off, Mr. Bean"). Teddy is also Mr. Bean's [...] "pet" [...] in [...] "Hair by Mr. Bean of London" [...] and is used to win a pet show.|$|E

2500|$|The Butt-Millet Memorial Fountain is [...] high. An {{octagonal}} grey granite base supports an [...] wide bowl {{of golden}} brown Tennessee marble. A grey granite Neoclassical column {{rises from the}} center of the bowl. Two figures in low bas-relief are depicted, one on the north and one on the south side of the column. [...] The northern figure of a woman with <b>paint</b> <b>brush</b> and palette, represents the fine arts. The southern figure of a man in armor and helmet, holding a shield, represents military valor. Four globes in the bowl surround the granite column and emit water, which cascades over the edge of the bowl into a shallow receptacle in the grey granite base. The fountain bowl was designed to be a source of drinking water for horses used by park police patrols.|$|E

In 2002, Poon's five-metre-high stainless steel sculpture Success represented Singapore in an international exhibition of 230 new sculptures held at the City Sculpture Park in Beijing, China. His work was chosen by China's Ministry of Culture in Singapore for the Olympic Games in 2008. Even after being diagnosed with lung cancer he continued to work, completing a sculpture for the Beijing 2008 Olympics shortly before he died and thus fulfilling a wish he made in 1991 when he said, [...] "I would like to end my life with a <b>paint</b> <b>brush</b> in my hand." ...|$|E

[...] He was now performing all over the world; a significant part of each year was spent on overseas tours. As a consequence, he formed new working relationships with artists from around the world, including the Swedish vocalist Alice Babs, and the South African musicians Dollar Brand and Sathima Bea Benjamin (A Morning in Paris, 1963/1997).|$|E

The horsehair is processed, cut to size and fitted to <b>paint</b> <b>brushes</b> that are used for anything from painting walls to painting pictures to be hung in galleries. Horsehair is desirable for <b>paint</b> <b>brushes</b> because of its smooth lay and ability to hold a large amount of paint acting as a reservoir and allowing the painter to stop less frequently.|$|R

The painting was entitled [...] presented by the artist , the 'excessivist' from Genoa was exhibited at the 1910 Salon des Indépendants. Boronali was in fact the Parisian donkey (Lolo), who made the painting with his tail. (Cf. Warnod, 1910; Weiss, 1994, pp.149–151, 304.) It is suspected that Lolo belonged to Frédéric Gérard (« le père Frédé »), owner of the cabaret Lapin Agile in la butte Montmartre. Roland Dorgelès and two friends, [...] et Jules Depaquit, attached a <b>paint</b> <b>brush</b> to the tail of the animal. The donkey did the rest. The painting sold for 400FF (equal to 1,257 Euros today) and was donated by Dorgelès to the Orphelinat des Arts. The painting forms part of the permanent collection at l'Espace culturel Paul Bédu (Milly-la-Forêt).|$|E

[...] According to local legend he used a <b>paint</b> <b>brush</b> to replace the crosswalk at night after visiting the nearby bars. [...] In fact, he performed the action with a parking lot striping machine during the day. [...] As a result of the May 2, 1986, incident, Steiger {{was arrested and charged with}} criminal damage and disorderly conduct, [...] The disorderly conduct count was dropped but the criminal damage charge went to trial.
