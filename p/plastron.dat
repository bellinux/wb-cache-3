5|$|The larger scutes {{display a}} pattern of black or yellow lines. The wood turtle's <b>plastron</b> (ventral shell) is {{yellowish}} in color and has dark patches. The posterior margin of the <b>plastron</b> terminates in a V-shaped notch. Although sometimes speckled with yellowish spots, the upper surface of the head is often a dark gray to solid black. The ventral surfaces of the neck, chin, and legs are orange to red with faint yellow stripes along the lower jaw of some individuals. Seasonal variation in color vibrancy {{have been known to}} occur.|$|E
5|$|Turtles are {{notable for}} their {{protective}} shells. They have an inflexible trunk {{encased in a}} horny carapace above and a <b>plastron</b> below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth {{have been replaced by}} sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.|$|E
25|$|The <b>plastron</b> (the ventral shell) is not hinged and has {{a shallow}} U-shaped notch in the pair of anal scutes. The bridge (the parts {{connecting}} the abdominal and pectoral scutes of the <b>plastron</b> to the carapace) is approximately the same length as the rear part of the <b>plastron</b> (consisting of the femoral and anal scutes). Both the bridge and the <b>plastron</b> can be entirely black, dark brown, or yellowish with splotches or patterns of darker colors.|$|E
50|$|Significant use of {{tortoise}} <b>plastrons</b> {{does not}} appear until the Shang culture sites. Ox scapulae and <b>plastrons,</b> both prepared for divination, were found at the Shang culture sites of Táixīcūn (台西村) in Hebei and Qiūwān (丘灣) in Jiangsu. One or more pitted scapulae were found at Lùsìcūn (鹿寺村) in Henan, while unpitted scapulae have been found at Erlitou in Henan, Cíxiàn (磁縣) in Hebei, Níngchéng (寧城) in Liaoning, and Qíjiā (齊家) in Gansu. <b>Plastrons</b> do not become more numerous than scapulae until the Rénmín (人民) Park phase.|$|R
50|$|Each fore foot {{has five}} webbed claws. Males have concave <b>plastrons</b> and longer, thicker tails than females.|$|R
50|$|Turtle <b>plastrons</b> {{were used}} by the ancient Chinese in a type of divination called plastromancy. See also oracle bones.|$|R
25|$|The common box turtle (Terrapene carolina) {{gets its}} common {{name from the}} {{structure}} of its shell which consists of a high domed carapace (upper shell), and large, hinged <b>plastron</b> (lower shell) which allows the turtle to close the shell, sealing its vulnerable head and limbs safely within an impregnable box. The carapace is brown, often adorned with a variable pattern of orange or yellow lines, spots, bars or blotches. The <b>plastron</b> is dark brown and may be uniformly coloured, or show darker blotches or smudges.|$|E
25|$|This {{species was}} {{originally}} described in 1885 by French zoologist Léon Vaillant, who proposed {{it as the}} species Testudo yniphora based on the distinguished shape of the anterior part of the <b>plastron.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} is not available, a faster, lower cost technique is potassium permanganate staining. The collected eggs are rinsed with a normal saline solution {{and placed in a}} glass petri dish. The eggs are soaked in a 1% potassium permanganate solution for one minute and then dehydrated and mounted onto a slide for observation. These slides can be used with any light microscope with a calibrated eyepiece to compare various morphological features. The most important and useful features for identifying eggs are the size, length, and width of the <b>plastron,</b> as well as the morphology of the <b>plastron</b> in the area around the micropyle. The various measurements and observations when compared to standards for forensically important species are used to determine the species of the egg.|$|E
50|$|Adults are {{somewhat}} sexually dimorphic. Mature males have longer and thicker tails, {{which are used}} for copulation, {{and the presence of}} enlarged and hooked claws on the males' front flippers allow them to grasp the female carapace during copulation. Males also have longer, more tapered carapaces than females, which have round, dome-like carapaces. Males also have more concave <b>plastrons,</b> believed to be another adaptation for mating. The <b>plastrons</b> of males may also be softer than females.|$|R

50|$|When {{it came to}} uniform, {{all three}} GBG units {{followed}} the pattern of Governor General's Body Guards and they just added few articles like cummerbunds and <b>plastrons.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{distinguishing}} {{characteristic of}} the genus is the secondary division of the abdominal scutes (the middle pair of scutes in the <b>plastron)</b> due {{to the development of}} the plastral hinge as the turtle matures. It eventually leads to the formation of small triangular additional scutes between the abdominal and pectoral scutes.|$|E
25|$|Parts of {{endangered}} species used as TCM drugs include tiger bones and rhinoceros horn. Poachers supply the black market with such substances, and the black market in rhinoceros horn, for example, has reduced the world's rhino population by more than 90 {{percent over the past}} 40 years. Concerns have also arisen over the use of turtle <b>plastron</b> and seahorses.|$|E
25|$|Cyclemys turtles are cryptodires, {{having the}} ability to pull their heads {{straight}} back and vertically into their shells instead of folding them sideways like pleurodires. The head varies between species from dull to striped with bright red or orange bands of color. The <b>plastron</b> can have a dark or light (tan to yellow) background which can be uniform or patterned with fine lines radiating {{from the center of}} each plastral scute.|$|E
50|$|Since divination (-mancy) was by heat or fire (pyro-) {{and most}} often on <b>plastrons</b> or scapulae, the terms pyromancy, plastromancy and scapulimancy {{are often used}} for this process.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} Chinese writing {{consists of}} divinatory texts inscribed on ox scapulae and tortoise <b>plastrons</b> {{found at the}} last Shang dynasty capital near Anyang and dating from 1200 BC.|$|R
50|$|In China, oracle {{bones were}} used for divination in the late Shang dynasty, (c. 1600-1046 BC). Diviners applied heat to these bones, usually ox scapulae or {{tortoise}} <b>plastrons,</b> and interpreted the resulting cracks.|$|R
25|$|Turtles {{can defend}} {{themselves}} from predation by hiding, closing their shell and biting. The {{risk of death}} is greatest in small animals due to their size and weaker carapace and <b>plastron.</b> While the shell of an adult box turtle is seldom fractured, the box turtle is still vulnerable to surprise attacks and persistent gnawing or pecking. Common predators are mammals like minks, skunks, raccoons, dogs and rodents, but also birds (e.g. crows, ravens) and snakes (e.g. racers, cottonmouths) are known to kill box turtles.|$|E
25|$|The {{carapace}} of {{the turtle}} has various color patterns that change over time. Hatchlings of Chelonia mydas, {{like those of}} other marine turtles, have mostly black carapaces and light-colored plastrons. Carapaces of juveniles turn dark brown to olive, while those of mature adults are either entirely brown, spotted or marbled with variegated rays. Underneath, the turtle's <b>plastron</b> is hued yellow. C. mydas limbs are dark-colored and lined with yellow, and are usually marked with a large dark brown spot {{in the center of}} each appendage.|$|E
25|$|A {{tracheal}} tube may contain ridge-like circumferential rings of taenidia in various geometries such as loops or helices. In the head, thorax, or abdomen, tracheae {{may also be}} connected to air sacs. Many insects, such as grasshoppers and bees, which actively pump the air sacs in their abdomen, are {{able to control the}} flow of air through their body. In some aquatic insects, the tracheae exchange gas through the body wall directly, {{in the form of a}} gill, or function essentially as normal, via a <b>plastron.</b> Note that despite being internal, the tracheae of arthropods are shed during moulting (ecdysis).|$|E
50|$|This is the holotype of the species. Head {{and limb}} colors are {{generally}} light orange to red. <b>Plastrons</b> are mostly pale yellow. They {{range in the}} Guiana Shield- Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, Guiana, and northern Brazil.|$|R
50|$|Scapulimancy (also spelled scapulomancy and scapulamancy, also termed omoplatoscopy) is the {{practice}} of divination by use of scapulae (shoulder blades). In {{the context of the}} oracle bones of ancient China, which chiefly utilized both scapulae and the <b>plastrons</b> of turtle, scapulimancy is sometimes used in a very broad sense to jointly refer to both scapulimancy and plastromancy (similar divination using <b>plastrons).</b> However, the term osteomancy might be more appropriate, referring to divination using bones. Many archaeological sites along the south coast and offlying islands of the Korean peninsula show that deer and pig scapulae were used in divination during the Korean Protohistoric Period, c. 300 BC - AD 300/400.|$|R
50|$|The sexual {{dimorphism}} {{of adult}} Indian star tortoises is quite apparent. Females are considerably larger {{than their male}} counterparts. In addition, the females' <b>plastrons</b> are much flatter {{than those of the}} males, which have a concave shape.|$|R
25|$|The Laas Geel cave {{paintings}} {{are thought to}} be some of the most vivid rock art in Africa. Among other things, they depict cattle in ceremonial robes accompanied by humans, who are believed to have been inhabitants of the region. The necks of the cattle are embellished with a kind of <b>plastron.</b> Some of the cattle are also portrayed wearing decorative robes. Besides long-horned cattle, the rock art also shows an image of a domesticated dog, several paintings of canidae as well as a giraffe. The site is excellently preserved due to the location of the paintings which are covered by the granite overhangs.|$|E
25|$|British yeomanry {{were armed}} with a 1908 pattern sword, and Lee–Enfield rifles, unlike their French and German counterparts, who were only {{armed with a}} shorter range carbine. As the war progressed, they were issued with brodie helmets, hand grenades, trench mortars and Hotchkiss light machine guns. Like the {{infantry}}, they were dressed in a karki uniform, with a service dress cap, and instead of infantry webbing, they carried their ammunition in a bandolier. The French cuirassiers, by comparison, would not have looked {{out of place in}} the Napoleonic Wars. Still wearing blue and red uniforms, with breast and back metal plates and plumed brass-steel helmets. While the Germans had a standard field grey uniform their uhlans still wore Polish style czapka helmets tunics with <b>plastron</b> fronts, the hussars frogged jackets, and the cuirassiers steel spiked helmets.|$|E
25|$|Anatomically, a few {{characteristics}} {{distinguish the}} green turtle {{from the other}} members of its family. Unlike the closely related hawksbill turtle, the green turtle's snout is very short and its beak is unhooked. The neck cannot be pulled into the shell. The sheath of the turtle's upper jaw possesses a denticulated edge, while its lower jaw has stronger, serrated, more defined denticulation. The dorsal surface of the turtle's head has a single pair of prefrontal scales. Its carapace is composed of five central scutes flanked by four pairs of lateral scutes. Underneath, the green turtle has four pairs of inframarginal scutes covering the area between the turtle's <b>plastron</b> and its shell. Mature C. mydas front appendages have only a single claw (as opposed to the hawksbill's two), although a second claw is sometimes prominent in young specimens.|$|E
50|$|The {{spotted turtle}} is declining {{throughout}} eastern Northern America due to habitat loss and poaching. From this study, most {{specifically on the}} Southeastern population, females had greater shell heights, heavier body masses, and longer <b>plastrons</b> than males.|$|R
25|$|The two {{distinct}} morphological differences between Cyclemys species {{are based on}} the main color of their <b>plastrons</b> - species with yellow bellies (C. atripons, C. dentata, and C. pulchristiata), and species with dark bellies (C. enigmatica, C. fusca, C. gemeli, and C. oldhamii).|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{surviving examples}} of writing in China—inscriptions on so-called [...] "oracle bones", tortoise <b>plastrons</b> and ox scapulae used for divination—date from around 1200 BC {{in the late}} Shang dynasty. A small number of bronze inscriptions {{from the same period}} have also survived.|$|R
25|$|Concerns {{have also}} arisen {{over the use}} of {{pangolin}} scales, turtle <b>plastron,</b> seahorses, and the gill plates of mobula and manta rays. Poachers hunt restricted or endangered species animals to supply the black market with TCM products. There is no scientific evidence of efficacy for tiger medicines. Concern over China considering to legalize the trade in tiger parts prompted the 171-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to endorse a decision opposing the resurgence of trade in tigers. Fewer than 30,000 saiga antelopes remain, which are exported to China for use in traditional fever therapies. Organized gangs illegally export the horn of the antelopes to China. The pressures on seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) used in traditional medicine is enormous; tens of millions of animals are unsustainably caught annually. Many species of syngnathid are currently part of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species or national equivalents.|$|E
25|$|To {{power the}} flippers, the {{shoulder}} girdle and the pelvis had been greatly modified, developing into broad bone plates at {{the underside of}} the body, which served as an attachment surface for large muscle groups, able to pull the limbs downwards. In the shoulder, the coracoid had become the largest element covering the major part of the breast. The scapula was much smaller, forming the outer front edge of the trunk. To the middle, it continued into a clavicle and finally a small interclavicular bone. As with most tetrapods, the shoulder joint was formed by the scapula and coracoid. In the pelvis, the bone plate was formed by the ischium at the rear and the larger pubic bone in front of it. The ilium, which in land vertebrates bears the weight of the hindlimb, had become a small element at the rear, no longer attached to either the pubic bone or the thighbone. The hip joint was formed by the ischium and the pubic bone. The pectoral and pelvic plates were connected by a <b>plastron,</b> a bone cage formed by the paired belly ribs that each had a middle and an outer section. This arrangement immobilised the entire trunk.|$|E
25|$|Numbers {{of mature}} adult Galápagos green turtle are {{much lower than}} those of other green sea turtle populations; this may be why they are more genetically {{isolated}} than other populations. The carapace is dark in color, usually black to dark olive-brown, is oval in shape, and tapers toward the tail. The carapace has a distinctive formation that is more sloped or domed than individuals of other populations. The five vertebral scutes are all alike in size with a hexagonal shape and flat edges. The lateral scutes are similar in size, but only four occur along each side. The carapace is tougher than the <b>plastron,</b> or the underside of the shell, and is also darker in pigmentation. They have been recorded up to 84cm in length, while other green sea turtles have been recorded up to 99cm in length. Their legs are shaped like flippers to aide in swimming; they are broad and generally flattened. The head is rounded and lizard-like with no teeth and does not have the predominantly hooked beak like many other green sea turtles. The sexes are similar in most aspects except size; the females are slightly larger, and the males have a longer tail.|$|E
50|$|The Burmese Star Tortoise has {{radiating}} star-shaped {{patterns on}} its strongly domed carapace. It has bumps on its shell {{that look like}} stars.This tortoise can easily be distinguished from the more common Indian star tortoise by comparing the <b>plastrons</b> of the two species.|$|R
