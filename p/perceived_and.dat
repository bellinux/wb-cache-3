5|$|Enlightenment {{philosophy}} {{had developed}} Western Europeans’ interest in Greece, or rather in an idealised Ancient Greece, {{the linchpin of}} Antiquity, as it was <b>perceived</b> <b>and</b> taught. The Enlightenment philosophers, for whom the notions of Nature and Reason were so important, believed that these had been the fundamental values of Classical Athens. The Ancient Greek democracies, and above all Athens, became models to emulate. There they searched for answers to the political and philosophical problems of their time. Works {{such as those of}} Abbé Barthélemy, Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis (1788), served to fix definitively the image that Europe had of the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} Test, Bradman {{returned}} to the team after his newspaper employers released him from his contract. England continued to use bodyline and Bradman was dismissed by his first ball in the first innings. In the second innings, against the full Bodyline attack, he scored an unbeaten century which helped Australia to win the match and level the series at one match each. Critics began to believe bodyline was not quite the threat that had been <b>perceived</b> <b>and</b> Bradman's reputation, which had suffered slightly with his earlier failures, was restored. However, the pitch was slightly slower than others in the series, and Larwood was suffering from problems with his boots which reduced his effectiveness.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} <b>perceiving</b> <b>and</b> imagining {{on the basis of}} predictive processing models in neuroscience. Contrary to the received view in philosophy of mind, which holds that <b>perceiving</b> <b>and</b> imagining are essentially distinct, these models depict <b>perceiving</b> <b>and</b> imagining as deeply unified and overlapping. It is argued that there are two mutually exclusive implications of taking perception and imagination to be fundamentally unified. The view defended is what I dub the ecological¿enactive view given that it does not succumb to internalism about the mind-world relation, and allows one to keep a version of the received view in play...|$|R
5|$|In {{light of}} the criticisms leveled against {{scientific}} jury selection—that it lets lawyers stack juries and distorts the effect of money—several reforms have been proposed. One common reform proposal is the elimination of peremptory challenges. Supreme Court precedent already forbids use of peremptories (peremptory challenges) to exclude jurors based solely on their race or sex. Proponents argue that doing away with peremptories altogether will eliminate the <b>perceived</b> <b>and</b> real injustice of permitting lawyers to eliminate jurors dispositionally unfavorable to them without a challenge for cause argument in open court. Opponents counter that attorneys cannot always ferret out actionable evidence of juror bias, particularly {{in the context of}} a limited voir dire.|$|E
5|$|The alpine pika can emit three {{different}} vocalizations. The long call is heard during the mating season from only the subspecies O. a. alpina, O. a. changaica, and O. a. nitida. The short call is a harsh, sharp whistle that is easily distinguishable from the short high-pitched whistle {{of the northern}} pika. The alarm call is given out immediately any danger from predators or humans is <b>perceived,</b> <b>and</b> can travel greater distances than the calls of most other pika species.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{missed the}} first Test, worn out by {{constant}} cricket and the ongoing argument with the Board of Control. The English bowlers used Bodyline intermittently in the first match, to the crowd's vocal displeasure. Behind the scenes, administrators began to express concerns to each other. Yet the English tactics still did not earn universal disapproval; former Australian captain Monty Noble praised the English bowling. For the second Test, Bradman returned to the team after his newspaper employers released him from his contract. England continued to use Bodyline and Bradman was dismissed by his first ball in the first innings. In the second innings, against the full Bodyline attack, he scored an unbeaten century which helped Australia to win the match and level the series at one match each. Critics began to believe Bodyline was not quite the threat that had been <b>perceived</b> <b>and</b> Bradman's reputation, which had suffered slightly with his earlier failures, was restored. However, the pitch was slightly slower than others in the series, and Larwood was suffering from problems with his boots which reduced his effectiveness. Meanwhile, Woodfull was being encouraged to retaliate to the short-pitched English attack, not least by {{members of his own}} side such as Vic Richardson, but refused to consider doing so.|$|E

5|$|For {{those who}} are single when injured or who become single, SCI causes {{difficulties}} and insecurities with respect to one's ability to meet new partners and start relationships. In some settings, beauty standards cause people to view disabled bodies as less attractive, limiting the options for sexual and romantic partners {{of people with disabilities}} like SCI. Furthermore, physical disabilities are stigmatized, causing people to avoid contact with disabled people, particularly those with highly visible conditions like SCI. The stigma may cause people with SCI to experience self-consciousness and embarrassment in public. They can increase their social success by using impression management techniques to change how they are <b>perceived</b> <b>and</b> create a more positive image of themselves in others' eyes. Physical limitations create difficulties; with lowered independence comes reduced social interaction and fewer opportunities to find partners. Difficulties with mobility and the lack of disabled accessibility of social spaces (e.g. lack of wheelchair ramps) create a further barrier to social activity and limit the ability to meet partners. Isolation and its associated risk of depression can be limited by participating in physical activities, social gatherings, clubs, and online chat and dating.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} the {{research}} {{study was to investigate}} the relationship of <b>perceived</b> benefits <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> barriers to the health behaviors of exercise, nutritional eating practices, and elimination of smoking. <b>Perceived</b> barriers <b>and</b> benefits were measured by a tool developed by Sechrist, Walker, & Pender (1987). A randomized sample of 300 adults living in Indiana were surveyed. The adults were employed by Hooks-Super X, Inc. and were randomly selected from a population of 3200 adults employee. Variables of exercise, nutritional eating practices, and smoking behavior were examined to determine if a relationship existed between the variables <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> barriers <b>and</b> benefits. Individual items measured the frequency of the variables. Three-way analysis of variance demonstrated that there was a relationship between exercise <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> barriers <b>and</b> benefits. Chi Square Goodness of Fit demonstrated that age evidenced a significance relationship with exercise. The findings of the study revealed a relationship between the Health Promotion Model <b>and</b> exercise <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> barriers <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> benefits.

In this article, we examine how customer expectation, <b>perceived</b> quality, <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> value {{may lead to}} exceptional satisfied customers, and ultimately to customer loyalty. Specifically, we investigate the chain of events through which customer expectation, <b>perceived</b> quality, <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> value influence customer satisfaction and customer loyalty {{in a sample of}} 323 customers. We present a conceptual model for linking customer expectation, <b>perceived</b> quality, <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> value to customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, and test this model using structural equation modeling. The results suggest that (1) <b>perceived</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> value are linked to customer satisfaction; (2) customer satisfaction is linked with customer loyalty.

Although the sense of time is not {{associated}} with a specific sensory system, the work of psychologists and neuroscientists indicates that human brains do have a system governing the perception of time, composed of a highly distributed system involving the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and basal ganglia. One particular component, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, is responsible for the circadian (or daily) rhythm, while other cell clusters appear to be capable of shorter-range (ultradian) timekeeping.|$|E

In contrast, {{little is known about}} the specific antecedents of <b>Perceived</b> Enjoyment <b>and</b> <b>Perceived</b> Usefulness in an SNS context. We address this gap by studying whether Perceived Belonging, which we describe as the degree to which a person feels connected to and accepted by other individuals, has an influence on these two constructs. After surveying 415 students and applying a structural equation modeling approach, we confirm that Perceived Belonging positively influences both <b>Perceived</b> Enjoyment <b>and</b> <b>Perceived</b> Usefulness <b>and,</b> hence, also indirectly influences overall SNS adoption behavior...|$|R
25|$|Stace {{argues that}} doctrinal {{differences}} between religious traditions are inappropriate criteria when making cross-cultural comparisons of mystical experiences. Stace argues that mysticism {{is part of}} the process of perception, not interpretation, that is to say that the unity of mystical experiences is <b>perceived,</b> <b>and</b> only afterwards interpreted according to the perceiver’s background. This may result in different accounts of the same phenomenon. While an atheist describes the unity as “freed from empirical filling”, a religious person might describe it as “God” or “the Divine”.|$|E

30|$|The price–quality–value {{model and}} means-end model {{propose that the}} {{trade-off}} between <b>perceived</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> sacrifice (the perception of paying the cost) results in <b>perceived</b> value (Monroe <b>and</b> Krishnan 1985). Accordingly, <b>perceived</b> sacrifice <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> value have a negative relationship, <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> savings <b>and</b> <b>perceived</b> value have a positive relationship. The findings of previous studies have supported these relationships. Grewal et al. (1998 b) and Teas and Agarwal (2000) found that {{a higher level of}} perceived sacrifice led to a lower level of perceived value. Choi et al. (2010) examined a price discount and a “Scratch and Save” type of price promotions and found that the expected savings positively influenced perceived value, supporting that perceived savings enhanced consumers’ perceptions of value.|$|R
