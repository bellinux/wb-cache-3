40|$|During nodule {{development}} on <b>pea</b> <b>roots,</b> apoplast undergoes changes in activity of plant cell wall proteins such as expansins (EXPs). Because {{the accumulation of}} EXP protein has been correlated {{with the growth of}} various plant organs, we investigated using Western Blot and immunolocalization studies with antibody against PsEXP 1, whether this protein was accumulated in the expanding cells of nodule. Immunoblot results indicated the presence of a 30 -kDa band specific for <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> nodules. The EXP proteins content rose during growth of <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> nodules. Expansin(s) protein was localized in nodule apoplast {{as well as in the}} infection thread walls. The enhanced amount of expansin-like proteins in meristematic part of nodule, root and shoot was shown. The localization of this protein in the meristematic cell walls can be related to the loosening of plant cell wall before cell enlargement.

40|$|Gene {{expression}} in <b>pea</b> <b>roots</b> grown {{in a medium}} with a low oxygen concentration was compared with that in nitrogen-fixing <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> nodules induced by Rhizobium bacteria. The results show that during microaerobiosis the expression of eight genes is increased. None of these belong {{to the group of}} genes earlier identified as nodulin genes. On the other hand, no enhanced transcription of microaerobic genes can be detected during nodule development and hybridizations of Northern blots, containing nodule RNA and RNA isolated from oxygen-stressed roots, show that the alcohol dehydrogenase genes are not expressed at a higher level in <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> nodules whereas a higher expression is observed during microaerobiosis. From these observations it can be concluded that it is unlikely that a low concentration of free oxygen induces the expression of nodulin genes. Furthermore, genes that are activated as a result of oxygen deficiency are not expressed in <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> nodules, indicating that if the concentration of free oxygen is low the nodule cells do not suffer under microaerobic conditions.

Populations of the composite cross were grown up to five generations with selection pressure in soil heavily infested with <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> pathogens or without selection pressure on soil free of <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> pathogens. Yield of populations of the F 9 and F 10 generations of the composite cross grown with selection pressure was on average 35 % {{higher than that of}} the population obtained without selection pressure as well as the average yield of the 8 parentals of the composite cross, which were of similar magnitude. In healthy soil the yield was overall higher than in the pathogen-infested soil, but yield did not differ between the populations from the composite cross with and without selection pressure, which were also similar to the average yield of the 8 different parentals. Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) randomly selected from the F 10 population with selection pressure developed 23 % less root rot than the corresponding F 10 population without selection pressure, when grown in field soil heavily infested with <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> pathogens.

From the cDNA clones that hybridized exclusively with the nodule probe five clones, designated pPsNod 6, 10, 11, 13 and 14 and each containing unique sequences, were further characterized together with one leghemoglobin and one root-specific cDNA clone. In vitro translation of RNA {{selected by the}} pPsNod clones showed that the corresponding genes encode nodulins with molecular weights ranging from 5 800 to 19 000.

This form of attachment, designated as cap formation, was dependent on the incubation pH and growth phase, with optimal attachment at pH 7. 5 and with bacteria in the early stationary phase of growth. Addition of glucose to the growth medium delayed the initiation of the stationary phase and cap formation, suggesting a correlation between cap formation and carbon limitation. Attachment of R. leguminosarum was not inhibited by pea lectin haptens which makes it unlikely that lectins are involved under the tested conditions. Moreover, heterologous fast-growing rhizobia adhered equally well to <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> hair tips.

The inhibitory action of ethylene is dependent on factors such as tissue age and solution composition which have no major effect on IAA inhibition. Ethylene production is enhanced by 100 μm IAA, but conditions which reduce the rate of ethylene evolution 2 to 3 -fold at the same IAA concentration fail to affect the inhibitory action of IAA on elongation.

There {{was no significant difference between}} the EM treatments, water or water + molasses. There was a highly significant difference in infection levels between the three zoospore inoculum levels. Previous trials with composts have indicated that the presence of Acremonium spp., Fusarium spp., and Paecilomyces spp. improved disease suppression in the composts while Penicillium spp. increased disease development. This may have a bearing on the failure of EM to control <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> rot. Control of damping off in organic production systems is difficult, due to the prohibition of synthetic fungicides. A successful biological control agent would be of considerable benefit for organic agriculture. A trial was set up to evaluate the potential of EM for control of damping off in lettuce. Soil, with a history of high levels of damping off, from the Biological Husbandry Unit at Lincoln University, Canterbury, New Zealand, and a control of commercial seed raising mix was placed into 7. 5 cm pots and planted with ten lettuce seeds (Lactuca sativa, cv.

The peat based seed raising compost received a water treatment and EM treatment.

Under all conditions tested, a positive correlation was observed between the percentage of fibrillated cells and the ability of these bacteria to form caps and to adhere to glass, suggesting that fibrils {{play a role in the}} attachment of Rhizobium leguminosarum to <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> hair tips and to glass (G. Smit, J. W. Kijne, and B. J. J. Lugtenberg, J. Bacteriol. 168 : 821 - 827, 1986). In the present paper the chemical and functional characterization of the fibrils of R. leguminosarum is described. Characterization of purified fibrils by infrared spectroscopy and cellulase treatment followed by thin-layer chromatography showed that the fibrils are composed of cellulose. Purified cellulose fibrils, as well as commercial cellulose, inhibited cap formation when present during the attachment assay. Incubation of the bacteria with purified cellulase just before the attachment assay strongly inhibited cap formation, indicating that the fibrils are directly involved in the attachment process. Tn 5 -induced fibril-overproducing mutants showed a greatly increased ability to form caps, whereas Tn 5 -induced fibril-negative mutants lost this ability. None of these Tn 5 insertions appeared to be located on the Sym plasmid. Both types of mutants showed normal nodulation properties, indicating that cellulose fibrils are not a prerequisite for successful nodulation under the conditions used. The ability of the fibril-negative mutants to attach to glass was not affected by the mutations, indicating that attachment to <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> hair tips and attachment to glass are (partly) based on different mechanisms. However, growth of the rhizobia under low Ca 2 + conditions strongly reduced attachment to glass and also prevented cap formation, although it had no negative effect on fibril synthesis.

Colonization levels of P. pisi in <b>pea</b> <b>roots</b> as well as the expression of genes possibly involved in the infection process were monitored using different DNA-based methods (quantitative PCR and (RT) -PCR). Ten candidate pathogenicity genes were identified and sequenced for P. pisi and their expression was measured during the infection process using quantitative reverse transcription (RT) -PCR. The putative pathogenicity genes cystein protease (Pro 1), putative endo 1, 3; 1, 4 beta glucanase (Glu 1), phosphoenolpyrovate carboxykinase (Pck 1), enzyme inhibitors (Gip 1) and (Epi 1), crinkler-like protein (Crn 1) and putative ABC-transporter (Pdr 1), were expressed during infection. Transcript levels of Pro 1, Glu 1, Pdr 1 and Crn 1 increased over the experimental period, while transcript profiles of Gip 1 and Epi 1 showed high expression during the first 2 - 6 hours following inoculation. No expression was detected for pyruvate dehydrogenase (Pdh 1), or the putative effector genes Avr 1 b- 1 or Nip 1. In a follow-up experiment, Pro 1 expression was higher during P. pisi growth on dead <b>pea</b> <b>roots</b> at 20 hours post-inoculation when compared with growth on living roots. Epi 1 was only expressed on live host material. Domain structure analysis revealed that P. pisi Pro 1 protease contains three conserved domains, a peptidase domain, an inhibitor domain and a lipid binding domain. Phylogenetic analysis of P. pisi protease revealed that this protein is most closely related to a homologue from P. sojae and likely belongs to a cathepsin-L-like group from the C 1 A subfamily of peptidases...|$|R
40|$|We {{observed}} no {{exchange between}} deuterated ethylene (C 2 D 4) and the hydrogen of pea seedlings (Pisum sativum L. cv. Alaska). This suggests that bonding forces in which exchange could readily occur are not {{important in the}} physiological action of ethylene. Deuterated ethylene was just as effective as normal ethylene in inhibiting the growth of <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> sections. These results indicate that splitting carbon to hydrogen bonds did not occur during ethylene action...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pea</b> <b>root</b> {{plastids}} {{were isolated}} by differential centrifugation and resulting crude plastid fraction was purified by centrifugation through 10 %(v/v) Percoll. Marker enzymes indicated that greater than 50 % of the plastids were recovered essentially free from mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum contamination. The optimum in vitro conditions for glycerolipid biosynthesis from (U-$ sp{ 14 }$C) glycerol- 3 -phosphate have been determined. Total glycerolipid biosynthesis was approximately 15 nmole/hr/mg protein {{in the presence}} of 200 $ mu$M glycerol- 3 -phosphate, 0. 5 mM each of NADH and NADPH, 15 mM KH$ sb 2 $CO$ sb 3 $, 0. 05 mM CoA, and 2 mM each of ATP and MgCl$ sb 2 $, 100 mM Bis Tris Propane (pH 7. 5) and incubated at the standard temperature of 25 $ sp circ$C. ATP, Coenzyme A and a divalent cation are absolutely required for glycerolipid biosynthesis, whereas reduced nucleotides and bicarbonate improve the synthesis to varying degrees. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate had little effect, while dithiothreitol, detergent and Mn$ sp{ 2 +}$ inhibited activity. Under the optimum conditions, isolated <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> plastids mainly synthesized approximately 15 % phosphatidic acid, 16 % phosphatidylcholine, 13 % phosphatidylglycerol, 32 % triacylglycerol. Galactolipid synthesis occurred only when UDP-galactose was supplied. Different concentrations of some cofactors resulted in alterations of glycerolipid distribution. Phospholipase A$ sb 2 $ and Rhizopus lipase digestions of phospholipids and neutral lipids revealed that radioactive fatty acids were preferentially esterified to position sn 2 of each glycerolipid with generally 2 - 4 times as much radioactivity as position sn 1. <b>Pea</b> <b>root</b> plastids are composed of approximately 62 % phospholipid, 24 % neutral lipid and 14 % glycolipid. Within these classes PG, TAG, and the galactolipids are the major components representing 24, 12, and 12 % of the total plastid lipids...|$|R
40|$|Vacuoles play very {{important}} physiological roles in plant cells. <b>Pea</b> <b>root</b> nodules, which exhibit distinct zonation (meristematic zone and central tissue zones), {{may serve as}} a good experimental model for the investigations of vacuole development and its importance to cell and tissue functioning. Moreover, the nodule central tissue is composed of both infected and uninfected cells which play different physiological roles and differ in the level of vacuolation. Cytological observations revealed that central vacuoles of the infected cells of the effective nodules expand toward cell walls. Thus only thin layers of the cytoplasm separate each central vacuole from plasma membrane and cell wall. This finding is discussed from the viewpoint of improved exchange of solutes and water between the central vacuole and apoplast of the infected cell. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the vacuoles of infected cells within a fragment of effective nodule central tissue, showed their spatial arrangement. Possible advantages coming from the spatial arrangement of vacuoles within the central tissue are discussed. A comparative study of the central tissue (bacteroidal tissue) and meristem vacuolation of the effective and ineffective <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> nodules is also presented. Morphometric measurements revealed that the effective nodule central tissue was more vacuolated than the ineffective one. It was proved that maturation of the infected cells involves dynamic changes in their vacuolation. Having numerous fixing nitrogen bacteroids, the infected cells of effective central tissue were less vacuolated than uninfected cells. On the other hand, both infected and uninfected cells of the effective central tissue showed a much higher level of vacuolation in nitrogen-fixing zone than cells of the same type in ineffective tissue. These results indicate that vacuolation {{is an important factor in}} development and functioning of <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> nodule central tissue...|$|R

Chemiluminescence was inhibited by treating <b>pea</b> <b>roots</b> with boiling ethanol or by placing them in a N 2 gas phase. Chemiluminescence was increased by an O 2 gas phase or {{by the addition of}} luminol. NaN 3 and NaCN blocked both in vitro and in vivo chemiluminescence...|$|R
40|$|Two year {{field trials}} (1999 - 2001) {{were carried out}} to {{determine}} the effect of seed winter pea inoculation and nitrogen top-dressing effect on nodule dry weight of <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> and also on the dry matter yield and fodder value of winter pea cv. Maksimirski ozimi and wheat cv. Sana mixture. Just before sowing the inoculation of pea seeds was performed by the indigenous variety of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae {{which is part of the}} microbial collection of the Department of Microbiology at the Faculty of Agriculture University of Zagreb. The highest total nodule dry weight on <b>pea</b> <b>root</b> was determined on the inoculated variant 2 (0. 710 g/variant).
