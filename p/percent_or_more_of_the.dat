25|$|Crude oil {{development}} and production in U.S. oil reservoirs can include {{up to three}} distinct phases: primary, secondary, and tertiary (or enhanced) recovery. During primary recovery only about 10 percent of a reservoir's original oil in place is typically produced. Secondary recovery techniques extend a field's productive life generally by injecting water or gas to displace oil and drive it to a production wellbore, resulting in the recovery of 20 to 40 percent of the original oil in place. However, {{with much of the}} easy-to-produce oil already recovered from U.S. oil fields, producers have attempted several tertiary, or enhanced oil recovery, techniques that offer prospects for ultimately producing 30 to 60 <b>percent,</b> <b>or</b> <b>more,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reservoir's original oil in place.|$|E
25|$|The 2-mm-long coffee borer beetle (Hypothenemus hampei) is {{the most}} {{damaging}} insect pest to the world's coffee industry, destroying up to 50 <b>percent</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coffee berries on plantations in most coffee-producing countries. The adult female beetle nibbles a single tiny hole in a coffee berry and lays 35 to 50 eggs. Inside, the offspring grow, mate, and then emerge from the commercially ruined berry to disperse, repeating the cycle. Pesticides are mostly ineffective because the beetle juveniles are protected inside the berry nurseries, but they are vulnerable to predation by birds when they emerge. When groves of trees are nearby, the American yellow warbler, rufous-capped warbler, and other insectivorous birds {{have been shown to}} reduce by 50 percent the number of coffee berry borers in Costa Rica coffee plantations.|$|E
