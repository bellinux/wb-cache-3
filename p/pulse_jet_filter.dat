40|$|To {{model the}} {{behaviour}} of a fabric filter {{it is essential}} to be able to predict the amount of cake removed {{as a result of the}} force applied to the filter medium by a cleaning pulse. Experimental measurements have been made of the fraction of cake removed as a function of the force exerted by an impulse tester designed to simulate the conditions experienced in a <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> <b>filter.</b> These experiments have shown that the force required to remove a given quantity of cake depends upon the areal cake density. The nature of this dependence has been predicted from theoretical consideration of the role of adhesion and cohesion forces, assuming that the cake breaks away in spalls of a regular shape and uniform size...|$|E

40|$|Air {{pollutants}} {{are added}} {{into the atmosphere}} from variety of sources that change {{the composition of the}} atmosphere and affect the biotic environment. Because of the presence of high amount of air pollutants in the ambient air, the health of the population and property is getting adversely affected. In Mettur thermal power station (MTPS) primary fuel is coal. The requirement of coal per day 14000 tons. The coal transported through railway wagons has been unloaded in wagon Tripler. From the wagon Tripler During the coal unloading activity, enormous coal has been extracted from the coal transfer chute, which in turn polluted the entire coal handling area. Hence, to tide over the problem, it is necessary to go for effective coal control measures in MTPS. In <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> bag <b>filter,</b> the coal that is disc lodged from a row of bags may be picked up by the adjacent row of bags as the latter is under suction. The coal may remain is suspended condition- especially if it is light and / or fine- the reverse upward gas flow not allowing the coal to settle in the hopper. This phenomenon is called fluidization of coal. The coal particles are sucked from the suction point and allowed to the bag filter. The air from the suction point is made to fall on the baffle plate and then it is allowed to the bags. This air goes {{to the bottom of the}} bag, then it comes out on the top of the bag there all the coal particles are collected on the outer surface of the bag. Then the cleaned air is sent out through the chimney...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The dynamic {{pressure}} characteristics of <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> pipe, <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> nozzles and ceramic filter {{can be measured}} by high-frequency {{dynamic pressure}} sensor. The research {{is focused on the}} influence of cleaning pressure, the diameter of nozzles, and the ratio of sectional area of nozzles to that of <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> pipe on <b>pulse</b> cleaning performance. The results show that the difference of <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> nozzles performance increases when cleaning pressure increases. The main reason leading to the difference of pulse cleaning is that the increasing rate of static pressure along cleaning direction is slow after the first large increase. The diameter of <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> nozzles has a significance affect on cleaning performance so that the uneven performance can be improved by decreasing the diameter of nozzle along the cleaning direction ladder likely. The ratio of sectional area of nozzles to that of the <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> pipe is a key factor in cleaning performance, and the best range of the ratio of sectional area of nozzles to that of the <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> pipe in the research is from 45 % to 55 %...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPulse-jet bag {{filters are}} {{frequently}} employed for particle removal from off gases. Separated solids form a layer on the permeable filter media called filter cake. The cake {{is responsible for}} increasing pressure drop. Therefore, the cake has to be detached at a predefined upper pressure drop limit or at predefined time intervals. Thus the process is intrinsically semi-continuous. The cake formation and cake detachment are interdependent and may influence {{the performance of the}} filter. Therefore, understanding formation and detachment of filter cake is important. In this regard, the filter media is the key component in the system. Needle felts are the most commonly used media in bag filters. Cake formation studies with heat treated and membrane coated needle felts in pilot scale <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> bag <b>filter</b> were carried out. The data is processed according to the procedures that were published already [Powder Technology, Volume 173, Issue 2, 19 April 2007, Pages 93 – 106]. Pressure drop evolution, cake height distribution evolution, cake patches area distribution and their characterization using fractal analysis on different needle felts are presented here. It is observed that concavity of pressure drop curve for membrane coated needle felt is principally caused by presence of inhomogeneous cake area load whereas it is inherent for heat treated media. Presence of residual cake enhances the concavity of pressure drop at the start of filtration cycle. Patchy cleaning is observed only when <b>jet</b> <b>pulse</b> pressure is too low and unable to provide the necessary force to detach the cake. The border line is very sharp. Based on experiments with limestone dust and three types of needle felts, for the <b>jet</b> <b>pulse</b> pressure above 4 bar and filtration velocity below 50 mm/s, cake is detached completely except a thin residual layer (100 – 200 μm). Uniformity and smoothness of residual cake depends on the surface characteristics of the filter media. Cake height distribution of residual cake and newly formed cake during filtration prevails. The patch size analysis and fractal analysis reveal that residual cake grow in size (latterly) following regeneration initially on the base with edges smearing out, however, the cake heights are not leveled off. Fractal dimension of cake patches boundary falls in the range of 1 – 1. 4 and depends on vertical position as well as time of filtration. Cake height measurements with Polyimide (PI) needle felts were hampered on account of its photosensitive nature...|$|R
