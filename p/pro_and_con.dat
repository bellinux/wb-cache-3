5|$|The {{project has}} been {{supported}} by editorials in newspapers, including The New York Times, the Chicago Sun-Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Boston Globe, and the Minneapolis Star Tribune, arguing that the existing system discourages voter turnout and leaves emphasis on only a few states and a few issues, while a popular election would equalize voting power. Others have argued against it, including the Honolulu Star-Bulletin. An article by Pierre S. du Pont, IV, a former governor of Delaware, in the opinion section of The Wall Street Journal has called the project an urban power grab that would shift politics entirely to urban issues in high population states and allow lower caliber candidates to run. A collection of readings <b>pro</b> <b>and</b> <b>con</b> has been assembled by the League of Women Voters.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a system that {{automatically}} extracts the <b>pros</b> <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> from online reviews. Although many approaches {{have been developed for}} extracting opinions from text, our focus here is on extracting the reasons of the opinions, which may themselves be in the form of either fact or opinion. Leveraging online review sites with author-generated <b>pros</b> <b>and</b> <b>cons,</b> we propose a system for aligning the <b>pros</b> <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> to their sentences in review texts. A maximum entropy model is then trained on the resulting labeled set to subsequently extract <b>pros</b> <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> from online review sites that do not explicitly provide them. Our experimental results show that our resulting system identifies <b>pros</b> <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> with 66 % precision and 76 % recall. ...|$|R
5000|$|This core {{construct}} [...] "reflects the individual's relative weighing of the <b>pros</b> <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> of changing". Decision making was conceptualized by Janis and Mann as a [...] "decisional balance sheet" [...] {{of comparative}} potential gains and losses. Decisional balance measures, the <b>pros</b> <b>and</b> the <b>cons,</b> have become critical constructs in the transtheoretical model. The <b>pros</b> <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> combine {{to form a}} decisional [...] "balance sheet" [...] of comparative potential gains and losses. The balance between the <b>pros</b> <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> varies depending on which stage of change the individual is in.|$|R

Hughan was elected to the Executive Committee of the ISS in 1907 and served continuously in that capacity {{until the end of the}} organization in 1921, continuing in a similar capacity in its successor organization, the League for Industrial Democracy (LID) through 1925. She also served as Vice President of the ISS from 1920 to 1921. Other so-called adult leaders of the ISS during this interval included Morris Hillquit, J.G. Phelps Stokes, Harry W. Laidler, as well as founding father Upton Sinclair.|$|E

500|$|Alan Scherstuhl wrote a very {{critical}} piece for The Village Voice; {{he called the}} film predictable and repetitive, and said it contained several facts that have been clearly [...] "common knowledge for years". Scherstuhl said it is scattershot, [...] "a litany of Things We Can All Agree Are Bad", but ultimately jumps between several topicswithout sufficient detail, in his opinionbut comes to no conclusion or alternative. Scherstuhl said not even common people would have their beliefs challenged {{and that they would}} [...] "dismiss it as the vague liberal agitprop that it is". Similarly, while saying the film discusses important issues, both Genevieve Koski of The Dissolve and Jennie Kermode of Eye for Film said it deals with several themes quickly but does not expand upon any of them. Koski said, [...] "The True Cost is methodical to a fault", while Kermode said it is [...] "a good starting point" [...] on the topic. Fashion critic Vanessa Friedman said it has an [...] "easy-to-swallow accessibility" [...] but that it [...] "oversimplifies" [...] some aspects of the industry. In addition to commenting on the lack of attribution for [...] "lots of eye-popping statements", she said, [...] "trying to do everything, he skirted a lot of things". The Los Angeles Timess Martin Tsai criticized Morgan for interviewing his own executive producers, saying [...] "the effects of fertilizers...don't appear quite as tangible", and faulted Morgan for not exploring [...] "retailer markups that could have gone toward improving sweatshop conditions instead of profit margins", but appreciated that he had interviewed people with both <b>pro</b> <b>and</b> <b>con</b> views. Lizzie Crocker of The Daily Beast said Morgan had socialist views and that the film implies he wants {{to go back to the}} 1960s. She also criticized some interviewees, such as Miller, whom she called a [...] "conspiracy theorist", and Wolff, whom she called a [...] "Marxist idealist". Crocker was dismissive of the film, saying, [...] "the film loses focus and credibility, criticizing not just the fashion industry but the global capitalist system that supports it".|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The Transtheoretical Model of {{behavior}} change (TTM) postulates that behavior {{change is a}} process involving progress through five distinct stages of change (SOC). One of the key components for progress to a later stage is decisional balance (<b>pros</b> <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> of changing to the target behavior). The goal {{of the present study}} is to test the two dimensions of decisional balance as postulated in the TTM in the context of exercising behavior. METHODS: The analyses are based on data from an online survey of 266 freshman students at the University of Zurich; participants self-reported their frequency of exercising and their weighing of the importance of 49 <b>pros</b> <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> of exercising. RESULTS: The results indicate that a two-dimensional solution of decisional balance is insufficient. The analysis of <b>pros</b> <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> of exercising yielded a seven-factor solution with in part different progressions through the SOC. CONCLUSIONS: With the subdivision into different <b>pros</b> <b>and</b> <b>cons,</b> intervention programs can be developed that better match the needs of participants in terms of fostering and decreasing the most important <b>pros</b> <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> of exercising...|$|R

Much of this commentary obscured {{the fact that}} the clemency power provided the President with several options short of a full, unconditional pardon. In an op-ed published in The Washington Post, former federal prosecutor and conservative activist William Otis argued the sentence was too stringent and that, instead of pardoning Libby, Bush should commute his sentence.|$|E

2500|$|Several key factors, {{including}} a prominent venue, skillful promotion, widespread publicity, elaborate catalog {{and the importance}} of the artworks themselves all contributed to the impact of the exhibition. [...] Timing also played a part in fostering public response both <b>pro</b> <b>and</b> <b>con</b> as the show’s run coincided with events such as the collapse of the Soviet Union, the allied victory in the Gulf War, the resurgence of multiculturalism and the revival of public interest in western themes in fashion, advertising, music, literature and film.|$|E
2500|$|The {{field of}} {{linguistics}} and psycholinguistics {{since then has}} been defined by reactions to Chomsky, <b>pro</b> <b>and</b> <b>con.</b> The pro view still holds that the human ability to use language (specifically {{the ability to use}} recursion) is qualitatively different from any sort of animal ability. This ability may have resulted from a favorable mutation or from an adaptation of skills evolved for other purposes. The view that language can be learned has had a recent resurgence inspired by emergentism. This view challenges the [...] "innate" [...] view as scientifically unfalsifiable; that is to say, it can't be tested. With the amount of computer power increasing since the 1980s, researchers have been able to simulate language acquisition using neural network models. These models provide evidence that there may, in fact, be sufficient information contained in the input to learn language, even syntax. If this is true, then an innate mechanism is no longer necessary to explain language acquisition.|$|E
2500|$|Community {{attitude}} towards homeless shelters varies widely, but {{one study found}} that older people, men, homeowners and all people making larger incomes were often adverse to the concept of homeless shelters in general. [...] Calgary neighborhoods recognize the need for shelters, but many don't want to situate a shelter near their own homes. A similar response came from residents in Oahu. In communities such as Portland, Oregon, where the weather can be quite harsh, there is an extensive network of supporters. These operate an informal restaurant, the [...] "Sisters of the Road" [...] cafe, which supports both homeless shelter clientele and also some unsheltered persons. At {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum, jurisdictions such as Santa Barbara, California, feature ongoing disputes in an often highly adversarial mode. Disputes have even reached such schemes as re-arranging benches on city sidewalks to discourage panhandlers. In another 2011 incident, an eight unit supportive housing project which had been approved was called back onto city council agenda the following week in order to allow approximately 35 public comments <b>pro</b> <b>and</b> <b>con,</b> despite the fact that the measure had just been approved.|$|E

2500|$|After this {{announcement}} by Massachusetts supporting OpenDocument, {{a large number}} of people and organizations spoke up about the policy, both <b>pro</b> <b>and</b> <b>con</b> (see the references section). [...] Adobe, Corel, IBM, and Sun all sent letters to Massachusetts supporting the measure. [...] In contrast, Microsoft sent in a letter highly critical of the measure. [...] A group named [...] "Citizens Against Government Waste" [...] (CAGW) also opposed the decision. The group claimed that Massachusetts' policy established [...] "an arbitrary preference for open source," [...] though both open source software and proprietary software can implement the specification, and both kinds of developers were involved in creating the standard (CAGW, 2005). However, InternetNews and Linux Weekly News noted that CAGW has received funding from Microsoft, and that in 2001 CAGW was caught running an astroturfing campaign on behalf of Microsoft when two letters they submitted supporting Microsoft in Microsoft's anti-trust case were found to have the signatures of deceased persons (Linux Weekly News). James Prendergast, executive director of a coalition named [...] "Americans for Technology Leadership" [...] (ATL), also criticized the state's decision in a Fox News article. In the article, Prendergast failed to disclose that Microsoft is a founding member of ATL. Fox News later published a follow-up article disclosing that fact.|$|E
