5|$|Although the {{settlement}} of the Americas occurred some 20,000 years ago, when the first Asians crossed the Bering Strait into Alaska, the earliest archaeological evidence of human habitation of the Bay Area dates to around 3,000 B.C. along {{the shores of the}} bay, with evidence pointing to even earlier settlement in <b>Point</b> <b>Reyes</b> in Marin County. The Miwokan and Costanoan Ohlone people, who were living in the Bay Area at the time of first European contact, were possibly descended from Siberian tribes who arrived at around 1,000 BC by sailing over the Arctic Ocean and following the salmon migration. The Ohlone lived in about forty or so tribes spread throughout the lands adjacent to the San Francisco Bay and as far south as Point Sur in near Monterey Bay.|$|E
5|$|The Bearded Man {{demands that}} Fassl kill Fain, beating him {{up when he}} doesn't comply. As she tends to Fassl, Fain first sees the Bearded Man in his place. While staking out Fain's house, the agents see the Bearded Man flee. Doggett pursues the Bearded Man while Reyes finds Fain alive. In the pursuit, Reyes falls through into a sewer, where she finds {{the remains of the}} Bearded Man's victims. After a {{struggle}} with the Bearded Man who is holding Doggett at knife <b>point,</b> <b>Reyes</b> shoots. The Bearded Man falls into the water and Doggett goes after him, only to pull up Fassl, much to his confusion. Reyes tries to remind him that it does not matter as long as the case is solved.|$|E
5|$|In 1575, a Spanish {{exploration}} party led by Sebastian Rodriguez Cermeno {{landed in}} Drakes Bay near <b>Point</b> <b>Reyes</b> {{and was the}} first European settler to claim land in the Bay Area. He was soon followed in 1579 by Sir Francis Drake, who also landed in Drakes Bay and claimed the land for England. The San Francisco Bay itself remained undiscovered by Europeans until a Spanish expedition led by Gaspar de Portolà sailed through the Golden Gate Strait in 1769. Further expeditions by Spanish explorers in the following years include those led by Juan Bautista de Anza who colonized the Presidio, and Gabriel Moraga who started at the Presidio and led expedition parties to San Jose and over the Pacheco Pass, as well as reaching the San Joaquin Valley. In 1821, Mexico gained its independence from Spain and the Bay Area became part of the Mexican province of Alta California, a period characterized by ranch life and visiting American trappers. Mexico's control of the territory would be short-lived, however, and in 1846, a party of settlers occupied Sonoma Plaza and proclaimed the independence of the new Republic of California. That same year, the Mexican-American War began, and American captain John Berrien Montgomery sailed the USS Portsmouth into the bay and seized San Francisco, which was then known as Yerba Buena, and raised the American flag for the first time over Portsmouth Square.|$|E

5000|$|Circuit Judge Richard C. Tallman {{argued that}} the {{characterization}} of Reyes {{as a victim of}} excessive punishment for cheating on a driver's license exam was incorrect. Tallman <b>pointed</b> out that <b>Reyes</b> was convicted for knowingly filing a false document under oath. Tallman also argued that supporters of Reyes had understated his criminality. Tallman described Reyes as [...] "a career criminal" [...] who had been convicted of committing six crimes in a 16-year period, including battery, armed robbery, being under the influence of a controlled substance and driving while under the influence, and who had spent six years in prison for various offenses prior to his sentencing under the three strikes law.|$|R
25|$|Where a tall cliff exists, {{a smaller}} {{structure}} may {{be placed on}} top such as at Horton Point Light. Sometimes, such a location can be too high, for example along {{the west coast of}} the United States, where frequent low clouds can obscure the light. In these cases, lighthouses are placed below clifftop to ensure that they can still be seen at the surface during periods of fog or low clouds, as at <b>Point</b> <b>Reyes</b> Lighthouse. Another victim of fog was the Old Point Loma lighthouse, which was replaced in 1891 with a lower lighthouse, New Point Loma lighthouse.|$|E
25|$|The first European {{to enter}} the bay is {{believed}} to have been the Spanish explorer Juan de Ayala, who passed through the Golden Gate on August 5, 1775 in his ship the San Carlos, and moored in a bay of Angel Island now known as Ayala Cove. Ayala continued to explore the Bay area and the expedition's cartographer, José de Cañizares, gathered the information necessary to produce the first map of the San Francisco Bay area. A number of place names survive (anglicized) from that first map, including <b>Point</b> <b>Reyes,</b> Angel Island, Farallon Islands and Alcatraz Island.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to migratory birds, a few species spend {{several months to}} nest at Mono Lake. Mono Lake has the second largest nesting population of California gulls, Larus californicus, {{second only to the}} Great Salt Lake in Utah. Since abandoning the landbridged Negit Island in the late 1970s, California gulls have moved to some nearby islets and have established new, if less protected, nesting sites. Cornell University and <b>Point</b> <b>Reyes</b> Bird Observatory have continued the study of nesting populations on Mono Lake that was begun over 20 years ago. Snowy plovers also arrive at Mono Lake each spring to nest along the remote eastern shores.|$|E
25|$|The village, {{founded by}} miners and lumberjacks, is {{located within the}} {{original}} Rancho Punta de los Reyes Sobrante land grant. It was a stagecoach stop along the north-south route. The village includes the historic Nelson Hotel, which was connected by the old North Pacific Coast Railroad to the Bolinas Station, en route to <b>Point</b> <b>Reyes.</b> That railway ran between Mendocino County and a ferry service to San Francisco at Sausalito. The hotel, with nearby guest houses, was later used by the U.S. Army during both World Wars as barracks. There was also a K-8 school, with about 50 pupils. The schoolhouse was located south of the village towards Bolinas, the nearest town. An early 20th-century pastime was a trip and picnic to the Copper Mine Gulch, which runs through the town.|$|E
25|$|Once in Yerba Buena, now San Francisco, the {{passenger}} Mr. Pfeffenhauser disembarked {{to continue his}} journey to find his relative Captain Sutter. There the ship was sold to a Frenchman, Joseph Yves Limantour, in a three way transaction. Limantour {{was in need of}} a new vessel since in October 1841, the merchant’s schooner Ayacucho had gone aground near <b>Point</b> <b>Reyes.</b> However, Limantour did not have cattle, but General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, Commander General of California, did have the cattle. Vallejo owned a substantial rancho in Sonoma with plenty of cattle. So in the deal Vallejo received merchandise from Limantour, the Oregonians received 350 head of cattle from Vallejo, and Limantour got the ship. The vessel was then renamed the Jóven Fanita in honor of General Vallejo’s seven-year-old daughter, Epifania.|$|E
25|$|The foggiest {{place in}} the world is Hamilton, New Zealand, {{followed}} closely by the Grand Banks off the coast of Newfoundland (the meeting place of the cold Labrador Current from the north and the much warmer Gulf Stream from the south). Some of the foggiest land areas in the world include Argentia (Newfoundland) and <b>Point</b> <b>Reyes</b> (California), each with over 200 foggy days per year. Even in generally warmer southern Europe, thick fog and localized fog are often found in lowlands and valleys, such as {{the lower part of the}} Po Valley and the Arno and Tiber valleys in Italy; Ebro Valley in northeastern Spain; as well as on the Swiss plateau, especially in the Seeland area, in late autumn and winter. Other notably foggy areas include coastal Chile (in the south); coastal Namibia; Nord, Greenland; and the Severnaya Zemlya islands.|$|E
25|$|Mission San Rafael {{was founded}} by the Spanish Franciscans in Coast Miwok {{territory}} in the late fall of 1817. By that time the only Coast Miwok people still on their land were those on the Pacific Coast of the Marin Peninsula, from <b>Point</b> <b>Reyes</b> north to Bodega Bay. The Spanish authorities brought most of the Coast Miwoks who had been at Missions San Francisco and San Jose back north to form a founding population for Mission San Rafael. But some who had married Ohlone or Bay Miwok-speaking Mission Indians remained south of the Golden Gate. Over time in the 1820s Mission San Rafael became a mission for Coast Miwok and Pomo speakers. Mission San Francisco Solano, founded in 1823 in the Sonoma Valley (the easternmost traditional Coast Miwok region), came to be predominately a mission for Indians that spoke the Wappo or Patwin languages.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to similar}} {{favourable}} climatic conditions, Eucalyptus plantations have often replaced oak woodlands, {{for example in}} California, Spain and Portugal. The resulting monocultures have raised concerns about loss of biological diversity, through loss of acorns that mammals and birds feed on, absence of hollows that in oak trees provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and small mammals and for bee colonies, as well as lack of downed trees in managed plantations. A study {{of the relationship between}} birds and eucalyptus in the San Francisco Bay Area found that bird diversity was similar in native forest vs. eucalyptus forest but the species were different. One way in which the avifauna changes is that cavity nesting birds including woodpeckers, owls, chickadees, wood ducks, etc. are depauperate in eucalyptus groves because the decay-resistant wood of these trees prevents cavity formation by decay or excavation. Also those bird species that glean insects from foliage, such as warblers and vireos, have population declines when eucalyptus replace oak forest. Birds that do well in eucalyptus groves in California like tall vertical habitat like herons and egrets (possibly because redwood trees are less available), or have longer bills, which {{may play a role in}} preventing their nostrils from being clogged by eucalyptus resin/pitch. The <b>Point</b> <b>Reyes</b> Bird Observatory observes that sometimes short-billed birds like the ruby-crowned kinglet are found dead beneath eucalyptus trees with their nostrils clogged with pitch.|$|E
500|$|Fruit bodies grow {{together}} {{in small groups}} {{on the ground in}} association with Bishop Pine (Pinus muricata). It is the most common Suillus species on Santa Cruz Island, its type locality and it has also been collected at Santa Rosa Island, and <b>Point</b> <b>Reyes</b> National Seashore in California. Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa, two of the four islands that make up the northern Channel Islands, have a Mediterranean climate with cool and wet winters, and warm and dry summers. [...] Most species of Suillus do not have spores that survive in the soil for extended periods of time, but the spores of S.quiescens can tolerate the dry conditions and heat typical of California. Another study showed that viable S.quiescens spores were present in steam-pasteurized soil planted in Oregon fields. The authors suggest that S.quiescens is an early successional species that fruits in young forests, and whose spores remain dormant in the soil for extended periods of time until the roots of a suitable pine host are encountered.|$|E
