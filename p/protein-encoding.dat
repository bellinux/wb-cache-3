5|$|Archaea {{usually have}} a single {{circular}} chromosome, {{with as many as}} 5,751,492base pairs in Methanosarcina acetivorans, the largest known archaeal genome. The tiny 490,885base-pair genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans is one-tenth of this size and the smallest archaeal genome known; it is estimated to contain only 537 <b>protein-encoding</b> genes. Smaller independent pieces of DNA, called plasmids, are also found in archaea. Plasmids may be transferred between cells by physical contact, in a process that may be similar to bacterial conjugation.|$|E
5|$|Transcription in archaea {{more closely}} resembles {{eukaryotic}} than bacterial transcription, with the archaeal RNA polymerase being {{very close to}} its equivalent in eukaryotes; while archaeal translation shows signs of both bacterial and eukaryal equivalents. Although archaea only have one type of RNA polymerase, its structure and function in transcription seems {{to be close to}} that of the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II, with similar protein assemblies (the general transcription factors) directing the binding of the RNA polymerase to a gene's promoter. However, other archaeal transcription factors are closer to those found in bacteria. Post-transcriptional modification is simpler than in eukaryotes, since most archaeal genes lack introns, although there are many introns in their transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA genes, and introns may occur in a few <b>protein-encoding</b> genes.|$|E

This is achieved by retrieval of the <b>protein-encoding</b> sequences (as originally inserted) from the cells showing the appropriate phenotype.|$|E
25|$|Plasmids are {{engineered}} {{to produce a}} protein product in which the DNA-binding domain (BD) fragment is fused onto a protein while another plasmid is {{engineered to}} produce a protein product in which the activation domain (AD) fragment is fused onto another protein. The protein fused to the BD may {{be referred to as}} the bait protein, and is typically a known protein the investigator is using to identify new binding partners. The protein fused to the AD may be referred to as the prey protein and can be either a single known protein or a library of known or unknown proteins. In this context, a library may consist of a collection of <b>protein-encoding</b> sequences that represent all the proteins expressed in a particular organism or tissue, or may be generated by synthesising random DNA sequences. Regardless of the source, they are subsequently incorporated into the <b>protein-encoding</b> sequence of a plasmid, which is then transfected into the cells chosen for the screening method. This technique, when using a library, assumes that each cell is transfected with no more than a single plasmid and that, therefore, each cell ultimately expresses no more than a single member from the protein library.|$|E
25|$|Defective T and B cells {{as well as}} {{markedly}} decreased IgG1 {{responses were}} observed in miR-155-deficient mice, IgG1 is reduced whereas {{the expression of the}} IgM immunoglobulin remains normal in these mice. The change in IgG1 levels maybe {{explained by the fact that}} it is a target for miR-155 in B cells, the <b>protein-encoding</b> mRNA for the transcriptional regulator Pu.1-protein, elevation of Pu.1 protein predisposes defective IgG1 production. In addition to Pu.1, there are nearly 60 other differentially elevated genes in miR-155 deficient B cells, further inspection revealed possible miR-155 target sites in the 3' UTR regions in these genes.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the seven}} serotypes of this virus, A, C, O, Asia 1, and SAT3 {{appear to be}} {{distinct}} lineages; SAT 1 and SAT 2 are unresolved clades. The mutation rate of the <b>protein-encoding</b> sequences of strains isolated between 1932 and 2007 has been estimated to be 1.46 × 10−3 substitutions/site/year, a rate {{similar to that of}} other RNA viruses. The most recent common ancestor appears to have evolved about 481 years ago (early 16th century). This ancestor then diverged into two clades which have given rise to the extant circulating Euro-Asiatic and South African. SAT 1 diverged first 397 years ago, followed by sequential divergence of serotype SAT 2 (396 years ago), A (147 years ago), O (121 years ago), Asia 1 (89 years ago), C (86 years ago), and SAT 3 (83 years ago). Bayesian skyline plot reveals a population expansion in the early 20th century that is followed by a rapid decline in population size from the late 20th century to the present day. Within each serotype, there was no apparent periodic, geographic, or host species influence on the evolution of global FMDVs. At least seven genotypes of serotype Asia 1 are known.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{eukaryotic}} cells {{contain an}} enzyme with reverse transcription activity called telomerase. [...] Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that lengthens {{the ends of}} linear chromosomes. Telomerase carries an RNA template from which it synthesizes a repeating sequence of DNA, or [...] "junk" [...] DNA. This repeated sequence of DNA is called a telomere and {{can be thought of}} as a [...] "cap" [...] for a chromosome. It is important because every time a linear chromosome is duplicated, it is shortened. With this [...] "junk" [...] DNA or [...] "cap" [...] at the ends of chromosomes, the shortening eliminates some of the non-essential, repeated sequence rather than the <b>protein-encoding</b> DNA sequence, that is farther away from the chromosome end.|$|E

50|$|The table below {{lists the}} seven known {{proteins}} {{that belong to}} the mammalian PIAS protein family.

5000|$|Beginning in 2004, Vogelstein and Kinzler, {{working with}} Victor Velculescu, Nicholas Papadopoulos {{and others in}} their group, began to perform large scale {{experiments}} to identify mutations throughout the genome. They {{were the first to}} perform [...] "exomic sequencing", meaning determination of the sequence of every <b>protein-encoding</b> gene in the human genome. The first analyzed tumors included those of the colon, breast, pancreas, and brain. These studies outlined the landscapes of human cancer genomes, later confirmed by massively parallel sequencing of many different tumor types by laboratories throughout the world. In the process of analyzing all the <b>protein-encoding</b> genes within cancers, Vogelstein and his colleagues discovered several novel genes that play important roles in cancer, such as PIK3CA, IDH1, IDH2, ARID1A, ARID2, ATRX, DAXX, MLL2, MLL3, CIC, and RNF43.|$|E

It contains 125 million base pairs. 58% of the genome consists of transposable elements, and the genome contains only 7500 identified <b>protein-encoding</b> genes. During symbiosis, genes involved in the decomposition of plant cell walls and lipids are induced.

50|$|Transposons and retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements. Retrotransposon {{repeated}} sequences, {{which include}} long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), {{account for a}} large proportion of the genomic sequences in many species.

50|$|Genomics {{involves}} {{the study of}} the genome, the complete DNA sequence, of organisms. While genomic sequence data has historically been sparse due to the technical difficulty in sequencing a piece of DNA, the number of available sequences is growing exponentially. However, while raw data is becoming increasingly available and accessible, the biological interpretation of this data is occurring at a much slower pace. Therefore, there is an increasing need for the development of machine learning systems that can automatically determine the location of <b>protein-encoding</b> genes within a given DNA sequence. This is a problem in computational biology known as gene prediction.|$|E

In March 2013, Holland and co-authors published a paper in PLoS One regarding microRNA in HIV genomes, titled [...] "Identification of Human MicroRNA-Like Sequences Embedded within the <b>Protein-Encoding</b> Genes of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus". The original academic paper describes the use of computational molecular biological (in silico) approaches to identify microRNA-like sequences in HIV. These sequences are suggested to have evolved to self-regulate survival of the virus in the host by evading its immune responses and thus influence the persistence, replication, and pathogenicity of HIV. Holland was awarded his Ph.D. in molecular biology during the USC Commencement on May 12, 2017.|$|E
