5|$|Upon the {{accession}} of Titus as emperor in 79, {{she returned}} to Rome, but was quickly dismissed amidst a number of popular measures of Titus to restore his reputation with the populace. It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> intended to send for her at a more convenient time. However, after reigning barely two years as emperor, he suddenly died on 13 September 81.|$|E
5|$|Asser's prose {{style has}} been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. His {{frequent}} use of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that is common in Insular Latin authors of the period. He uses several words that are peculiar to Frankish Latin sources. This has led to speculation that he was educated at least partly in Francia, {{but it is also}} <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.|$|E
5|$|Besides sending Walter on {{diplomatic}} missions, King John gave Walter {{custody of}} Rochester Castle on 20 July 1202, but as Walter was already {{accounting for the}} taxes and fees {{of the city of}} Rochester to the Exchequer in 1200, it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> held the castle before 1202. John also upheld the right of the archbishop to mint coins, which Walter held until his death in 1205.|$|E

[...] "And I put Lister on board the mail-boat and sent him there! If I'd only known what {{the result would be}} I'd have drowned him." ...|$|R

5|$|By {{the sixth}} {{year of the}} revolt (494 BC), the Persian forces had regrouped. The {{available}} land forces were gathered into one army, and were accompanied by a fleet supplied by the re-subjugated Cypriots, along with Egyptians, Cilicians and Phoenicians. The Persians headed directly to Miletus, paying little attention to other strongholds, presumably intending to tackle the revolt at its epicentre. The Median general Datis, an expert on Greek affairs, was certainly dispatched to Ionia by Darius at this time. It is therefore <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was in overall command of this Persian offensive.|$|E
5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It is also <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he would be the only person to influence them.|$|E
5|$|Giraldus Cambrensis wrote a Life of St Æthelberht, {{probably}} at Hereford during the 1190s. He quotes an incident from Asser {{that occurred during}} the reign of Offa of Mercia, who died in 796. This incident is not in the surviving copies of the manuscript. It is possible that Giraldus had access to a different copy of Asser's work. It is also <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is quoting a different work by Asser, which is otherwise unknown, or even that Giraldus is making up the reference to Asser to support his story. The latter is at least plausible, since Giraldus is not always regarded as a trustworthy writer.|$|E
2500|$|... "In his [...] {{translation}} ... Beckett {{struggled to}} retain the French atmosphere as much as <b>possible,</b> so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> delegated all the English names and places to Lucky, whose own name, he thought, suggested such a correlation." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{suggestion}} {{came in the}} way of a {{big surprise}} to Dan, who, while making plans for this entertainment had entirely overlooked the <b>possible</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might be asked to do <b>that</b> which <b>he</b> the same as demanded from others.|$|R
60|$|Even though {{two hours}} had been spent in this work, Bill {{did not show}} himself. It was <b>possible,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{believed}} it dangerous to move about in the daytime, but would join his companion after dark.|$|R
5|$|In 1111, Domnall evidently {{seized the}} kingship of the Isles by force. It is {{uncertain}} whether he enjoyed Uí Briain support in this venture. Several years later, {{at a time}} when his aforesaid uncle was gravely ill, Domnall was again active in Ireland. Although he may have openly left the Isles to take advantage of his uncle's demise, it is also possible he was forced out by the Islesmen. Domnall was slain in 1115, apparently at the hands of Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht. It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was survived by two sons.|$|E
5|$|In Bauer's view, the {{presence}} {{at one of}} the meetings of Gerhard Clages of the SS signals that Himmler was focusing on secret peace talks. Brand and Grosz arrived in Istanbul just two months before the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944. Himmler knew that attempts might be made on Hitler's life, though not where and when. It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted to broker for peace in case Hitler did not survive, using low-level agents for plausible deniability, and if Hitler did survive, Bauer argues, Himmler could offer him a peace deal with the West that excluded the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the root of the quarrel between Cnut and Malcolm lies in Cnut's pilgrimage to Rome, and the coronation of Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II, where Cnut and Rudolph III, King of Burgundy had the place of honour. If Malcolm were present, and the repeated mentions of his piety in the annals make it quite <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> made a pilgrimage to Rome, as did Mac Bethad mac Findláich ("Macbeth") in later times, then the coronation would have allowed Malcolm to publicly snub Cnut's claims to overlordship.|$|E
60|$|Although I {{must admit}} that at this stage the thought <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might {{actually}} be accused of a low and sordid crime never seriously entered his head, <b>he</b> nevertheless felt <b>that</b> suspicion hovered round him, that some people at any rate held it <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> since <b>he</b> would benefit by the crime, he might quite well have contemplated it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is it possible, mother,' her son {{leaned forward}} to be the nearer to her while he whispered it, and laid his hand nervously upon her desk, 'is it <b>possible,</b> mother, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had unhappily wronged any one, and made no reparation?' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{now turned}} his steps towards his own former lodgings by St. Germain l'Auxerrois. It was just <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> Armand {{had succeeded in}} leaving a message there for him. It was, of course, equally <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> when <b>he</b> did so Heron's men had watched his movements, and that spies would be {{stationed}} there, too, on the watch.|$|R
5|$|The nominal heir of Perdiccas, his son Amyntas IV, was at {{this time}} still an infant. Philip, the sole {{surviving}} son of Amyntas III, was the obvious candidate to rule Macedon and was acclaimed by the army, probably as king. It is also <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was initially acclaimed as regent for his nephew Amyntas IV, and later usurped the throne, although if so, he did not harm Amyntas. Either way, Philip II became king by 359 BC, and began energetically attempting to save Macedon from destruction.|$|E
5|$|The {{younger son}} of Henry and Margaret Wright, Edward Wright {{was born in}} the village of Garveston in Norfolk, East Anglia, and was baptised there on 8 October 1561. It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{followed}} in the footsteps of his elder brother Thomas (died 1579) and went to school in Hardingham. The family was of modest means, and he matriculated at Gonville and Caius College, University of Cambridge, on 8 December 1576 as a sizar. Sizars were students of limited means who were charged lower fees and obtained free food and/or lodging and other assistance during their period of study, often in exchange for performing work at their colleges.|$|E
5|$|While the wrestler {{who would}} later become known as Diamante Azul has never {{revealed}} his birth name, he did unveil that he was born on December 20, 1982. Lucha libre has a long held tradition of not revealing the birth name of masked wrestlers unless they are later unmasked. Due to the secretive nature of lucha libre it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> made his wrestling debut prior to 2007 under a masked or unmasked identity {{that has not been}} revealed yet.|$|E
6000|$|This {{he spoke}} in so stern a voice <b>that</b> <b>he</b> almost frightened her. Was it <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> after all <b>he</b> should find it {{necessary}} to refer again to the little fault which she had so cordially avowed? ...|$|R
50|$|At some point, {{he began}} to make plans {{to travel to the}} United States and {{contacted}} an American publisher about a <b>possible</b> autobiography <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would write. <b>He</b> had concerns <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might be prevented from leaving Japan and went as far as to negotiate a written safe-conduct guarantee.|$|R
2500|$|Mr. Garamond, {{whose primary}} {{business}} is selling dreams (through his vanity press outlet), comes {{to believe the}} fantasy world his authors weave. It is <b>possible</b> though, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had always been a}} [...] "Diabolical", and founded his publishing business to fish for information.|$|R
5|$|According to {{the book}} by Nationalmuseum, the {{controversy}} concerned Carl Larsson's personal prestige and the ideals that he stood for, but his contemporaries would turn more and more indifferent to these ideals. The events embittered his last years and he declared in his autobiography that the controversy broke him down and that he admitted it with anger. It is clear {{that he began to}} identify himself with the work and it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> also identified himself with the sacrificed king, as he primarily saw conspiracies and bad intentions behind the opposition. This identification was made apparent in his self-portrait, in 1916, where he presented himself as king Domalde, and which he donated to Sundborn parish where he lived.|$|E
5|$|Born in Exeter around 1125, Baldwin {{was the son}} of Hugh d'Eu, Archdeacon of Totnes, and a {{woman of}} unknown name who later became a nun. Gervase of Canterbury's story that he was from an even humbler {{background}} has been shown by modern scholarship to stem from bias on the medieval chronicler's part. It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> studied at Bologna in the 1150s with the future Pope Urban III. Robert Warelwast, who was Bishop of Exeter from 1138 to 1155, had sent Baldwin to Italy to study law. Baldwin was also said to have taught at Exeter, although this is not substantiated by any contemporary record. In 1150 or 1151 Pope Eugene III appointed him tutor to Eugene's nephew. By 1155 Baldwin seems to have returned to England, where he joined the household of Robert of Chichester, Bishop of Exeter.|$|E
5|$|If {{the account}} of Gilli in the {{aftermath}} of Clontarf has been constructed for dramatic effect, the passage may not be evidence of his floruit beyond this point in history. In fact, it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is identical to Gilla Ciaráin mac Glún Iairn (died 1014), a man who was amongst those slain at the battle. The Annals of Ulster, which records the latter's fall, styles him rígdamna Gall ("heir-designate of the Foreigners"), revealing that Gilla Ciaráin was indeed a prominent man. Sitriuc is known to have had an elder brother named Glún Iairn, a man who had reigned as King of Dublin until his death in 989. If Gilla Ciaráin was a son of this king, his apparent tender age {{at the time of his}} father's death could account for Sitriuc's accession to the kingship. Furthermore, the aforesaid title accorded to Gilla Ciaráin appears to indicate that he was regarded as his uncle's royal heir. If Gilli and Gilla Ciaráin are indeed identical, his pre-eminent status in the Norse-Gaelic world would help to explain his marital alliance with Sigurðr.|$|E

50|$|A {{native of}} New Orleans, Louisiana, Mayer moved {{with his family}} in 1855 to Pennsylvania, where he spent his boyhood engaged in hunting, fishing, and firearms. <b>He</b> once said <b>that</b> his life goal was to see as many gunshops as <b>possible,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did.|$|R
5|$|In 972 Oswald {{was made}} Archbishop of York and journeyed to Rome {{to receive a}} pallium from Pope John XIII. It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> also {{traveled}} on Edgar's behalf {{to the court of}} the Emperor Otto I, and that these two journeys had been combined. He continued to hold the see of Worcester in addition to York. The holding of Worcester in addition to York became traditional for almost the next fifty years. Although it was uncanonical, it had many advantages for York in that it added a much richer diocese to their holdings, and one which was more peaceful as well. When Edgar died in 975, Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia, broke up many monastic communities, some of which were Oswald's foundations. Ramsey, however, was not disturbed, probably due to the patronage of Æthelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia, son of Æthelstan Half-King. Ælfhere was a supporter of Ethelred the Unready, the son of Edgar's third marriage, while Oswald supported the son of Edgar's first marriage, Edward the Martyr, in the dispute over who would succeed King Edgar.|$|E
5|$|Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji {{was born}} Leon Dudley Sorabji in Chingford, Essex (now Greater London), on 14 August 1892. His father, Shapurji Sorabji, was a civil {{engineer}} of Parsi parentage from Bombay, India, born on 18 August 1863. His mother, Madeleine Marguerite Mathilde Sorabji (née Madeline Matilda Worthy; 13 August 1866– 5 May 1959), was English. She {{is said to have}} been a singer, pianist and organist, but no evidence has been found to support these claims. They married on 18 February 1892. Shapurji Sorabji had married in India in 1880 but, as no record of his first wife's death or his divorce from her has yet been traced, it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> married the composer's mother bigamously.|$|E
5|$|Many Belgians {{were highly}} {{critical}} of the magazine due to its connections with Hergé, who was still deemed a collaborator and traitor by many; La Soir and La Cité publicly criticised the decision without referring to him by name while Le Quotidien and Le Drapeau Rouge specifically singled him out for denunciation. Hergé believed that the children's author Jeanne Cappe was behind many of these accusations, and threatened her with a lawsuit. Unhappy with life in Belgium, Hergé made plans to emigrate to Argentina, a nation that was welcoming many Europeans who had supported the defeated Axis powers and which had a thriving comic book scene. Ultimately, he changed his mind, for reasons that have remained unknown; it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was unable to secure any promise of work in the South American country.|$|E
50|$|There {{is another}} story of Georgios being {{captured}} in his youth and brought to Baghdad as a prisoner. It is <b>possible,</b> but unlikely, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> made the journey twice. It is also <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> in this story he was confused with another person.|$|R
60|$|Two {{days after}} this {{adventure}} I heard that Don Hilario had left Montevideo. <b>That</b> <b>he</b> had discovered nothing I was positive; it was <b>possible,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had left some person {{to watch the}} house, and, as Paquíta was now anxious {{to get back to}} her own country, I determined to delay our departure no longer.|$|R
