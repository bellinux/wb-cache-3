40|$|Sensor based sorting finds broad {{applications}} in mining, recycling and quality control. Digital image processing and pattern recognition are key components, as they determine whether to keep or discard an object under inspection. In many scenarios, {{the color of}} a material stands out as the <b>primary</b> <b>sorting</b> criterion. In this paper, we present a flexible system for color sorting of bulk materials based on semantic color features. The features are constructed in a three stages: the color occurrence frequencies of different materials are estimated and then fused to a small number of color classes, which in turn are used to map each color to a discrete attribute. A compact object descriptor composed of the fractions of foreground pixels that share the same attribute characterizes the objects under inspection. This descriptor has many advantages: it has a very clear, intuitive interpretation, is invariant to rotation and scale of the object and requires very little computation. However, a major drawback are the many variables that govern the construction process. Manual fine tuning requires a large amount of time and experience. Subtle changes in the parameters can have strong effects on the classification performance. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a method to automatically learn the parameters by a genetic algorithm. We apply our method to wine grape sorting problems to show that this approach performs at least as good a human expert. At the same time, it takes considerably less effort on the human part and frees the operator to attend to other tasks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In yeast and mammals, many plasma {{membrane}} (PM) proteins destined for degradation are tagged with ubiquitin. These ubiquitinated proteins are internalized into clathrin-coated vesicles and are transported to early endosomal compartments. There, ubiquitinated proteins are sorted by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery into the intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes. Degradation of these proteins occurs after endosomes fuse with lysosomes/lytic vacuoles to release their content into the lumen. In plants, some PM proteins, which cycle between the PM and endosomal compartments, {{have been found}} to be ubiquitinated, but it is unclear whether ubiquitin is sufficient to mediate internalization and thus acts as a <b>primary</b> <b>sorting</b> signal for the endocytic pathway. To test whether plants use ubiquitin as a signal for the degradation of membrane proteins, we have translationally fused ubiquitin to different fluorescent reporters for the {{plasma membrane}} and analyzed their transport. Results Ubiquitin-tagged PM reporters localized to endosomes and to the lumen of the lytic vacuole in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts and in tobacco epidermal cells. The internalization of these reporters was significantly reduced if clathrin-mediated endocytosis was inhibited by the coexpression of a mutant of the clathrin heavy chain, the clathrin hub. [*]Surprisingly, a ubiquitin-tagged reporter for the Golgi was also transported into the lumen of the vacuole. Vacuolar delivery of the reporters was abolished upon inhibition of the ESCRT machinery, indicating that the vacuolar delivery of these reporters occurs via the endocytic transport route. Conclusions Ubiquitin acts as a sorting signal at different compartments in the endomembrane system to target membrane proteins into the vacuolar degradation pathway: If displayed at the PM, ubiquitin triggers internalization of PM reporters into the endocytic transport route, but it also mediates vacuolar delivery if displayed at the Golgi. In both cases, ubiquitin-tagged proteins travel via early endosomes and multivesicular bodies to the lytic vacuole. This suggests that vacuolar degradation of ubiquitinated proteins is not restricted to PM proteins but might also facilitate the turnover of membrane proteins in the early secretory pathway. </p...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To show {{whether the}} {{inhibitory}} {{effects of the}} cholesterol synthesis inhibitor simvastatin on human CD 34 (+) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells can be further promoted by combining it with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib. Experimental Design: Normal CD 34 (+), AML CD 34 (+), and CD 34 (-) sorted subfractions, and AML cell lines (TF- 1 and KG 1 A) were exposed to simvastatin and tipifarnib. Results: Both simvastatin and tipifarnib showed a cytotoxic effect on AML cell lines, which was additive when used in combination. In <b>primary</b> <b>sorted</b> CD 34 (+) AML cells, a heterogeneous response pattern was observed upon treatment with simvastatin when analyzing cell survival. A group of normal (n = 12) and abnormal (n = 10) responders were identified within the AML CD 34 (+) subfraction when compared with normal CD 34 (+) cells. This distinction was not observed within the AML CD 34 (-) cell fraction. When the CD 34 (+) AML cells were exposed to simvastatin and tipifarnib, a significant enhanced inhibitory effect was shown exclusively in the normal AML responder group, whereas the AML CD 34 (-) cell fractions all showed an enhanced inhibitory effect. The observed heterogeneity in AML responsiveness could not be explained by differences in effects on cholesterol metabolism genes or extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in response to simvastatin and tipifarnib treatment. Conclusion: The results suggest that combined treatment with statins and farnesyltransferase inhibitors may be beneficial for a subset of AML patients that can be defined by studying the AML CD 34 (+) fraction...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Laminin- 5 (ln- 5), a large heterotrimeric {{glycoprotein}} {{consisting of}} an alpha 3, beta 3, and gamma 2 chain, is {{a component of}} epithelial cell basement membranes that functions as a ligand of the alpha 3 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 4 integrins to regulate cell adhesion, migration, and morphogenesis. The ln- 5 chains show tissue-specific patterns of regulation in tumors derived from different tissues. For example, ln- 5 is often up-regulated in gliomas, gastric carcinomas, and squamous carcinomas and down-regulated in prostate and basal cell carcinomas. Ln- 5 expression patterns may represent useful tumor markers and help to elucidate the role of ln- 5 in tumor progression in different tissue types. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have studied ln- 5 expression patterns in the breast. mRNA levels were examined in tumor and normal breast epithelial cell lines, tissue samples, and immunomagnetically <b>sorted</b> <b>primary</b> cultures using differential display, Northern blotting, and hybridization arrays. Protein levels were examined by immunoprecipitation. Gene integrity was assessed by Southern blotting of representative cell types. RESULTS: Ln- 5 alpha 3, beta 3, and gamma 2 mRNA expression {{was found to be}} markedly down-regulated in a panel of breast tumor cell lines when compared with normal breast epithelial cells. Ln- 5 mRNA was expressed at relatively high levels in MCF- 10 A immortal normal breast epithelial cells, long-term cultures of normal breast cells, and <b>sorted</b> <b>primary</b> cultures of normal breast luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Reduced, but detectable, levels of ln- 5 tended to be expressed in cell lines derived from early-stage breast tumors, whereas expression was generally not detected in cell lines derived from later-stage tumors. In breast tumor tissue specimens, expression of ln alpha 3 and beta 3 mRNAs tended to be reduced relative to levels observed in adjacent nontumor tissue, whereas in gamma 2 levels were elevated in specimens with increased amounts of myoepithelial cells. These ln- 5 expression changes could not be attributed to large-scale mutations or gene rearrangements. Ln- 5 protein levels were found to reflect mRNA levels in representative cell lines. At senescence, a growth state believed to suppress tumorigenesis, expression of all three ln- 5 mRNAs was up-regulated. CONCLUSION: The down-regulation of ln- 5 mRNA expression in breast tumors cells provides a new molecular marker and suggests that ln- 5 functions to control tumor progression in the breast...|$|R

Additionally, {{the role of the}} bone marrow stroma in regulating clinical responses to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) is also poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a DNA methylome analysis of bone marrow-derived stromal cells from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients and observed widespread aberrant cytosine hypermethylation occurring preferentially outside CpG islands. Stroma derived from 5 -azacytidine-treated patients lacked aberrant methylation and DNMTi treatment of primary MDS stroma enhanced its ability to support erythroid differentiation. An integrative expression analysis revealed that the WNT pathway antagonist FRZB was aberrantly hypermethylated and underexpressed in MDS stroma.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{developed}} a total RNA amplification and labeling strategy for use with Affymetrix GeneChips. Our protocol, which we denote BIIB, employs two rounds of linear T 7 amplification followed by Klenow labeling to generate a biotinylated cDNA. In benchmarking studies using a titration of mouse universal total RNA, BIIB outperformed commercially available kits in terms of sensitivity, accuracy, and amplified target length, while providing equivalent results for technical reproducibility. BIIB maintained 50 and 44 % present calls from 100 and 50  pg of total RNA, respectively. Inter- and intrasample precision studies indicated that BIIB produces an unbiased and complete expression profile within a range of 5  ng to 50  pg of starting total RNA. From a panel of spiked exogenous transcripts, we established the BIIB linear detection limit to be 20 absolute copies. Additionally, we demonstrate that BIIB is sensitive enough to detect the stochastic events inherent in a highly diluted sample. Using RNA isolated from whole tissues, we further validated BIIB accuracy and precision by comparison of 224 expression ratios generated by quantitative real-time PCR.

While the normal FLT 3 receptor is expressed in early hematopoietic progenitor cells, it has not been determined whether FLT 3 mutations are present in the leukemic stem cells. In this study, we <b>sorted</b> <b>primary</b> AML samples into stem cell-enriched CD 34 +/CD 38 - fractions and then analyzed the sorted and unsorted cells for the FLT 3 mutant-wild-type ratio. In each case, the FLT 3 mutant-wild-type ratio was not changed by selection of CD 34 +/CD 38 - cells, implying that the mutations are present in the leukemic stem cells.

40|$|EBP) {{transcription}} factor is indispens-able for myeloid differentiation. In various myeloid leukemias, C/EBP is mutated or functionally impaired due to decreased C/EBP expression or phosphorylation. In order {{to investigate the}} functional con-sequences of decreased C/EBP func-tion in AML, we reintroduced C/EBP in <b>primary</b> CD 34 <b>sorted</b> acute myeloid leu-kemia (AML) cells using a lentiviral ap-proach. Self-renewal and differentiation of primary AML stem cells were studied on long-term MS 5 cocultures. Activation of C/EBP immediately led to a growth arrest in all AML cultures (N 7), result-ing in severely reduced expansion com-pared with control cultures. This growth arrest corresponded with enhanced myeloid differentiation as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis for CD 14, CD 15, and CD 11 b. Myeloid differentiation was further con-firmed by the up-regulation of neutro-phil elastase and granulocyte colony-stimulatingfactor (G-CSF) receptor inC/EBP transduced cells. C/EBP-expressing AML CD 34 cells failed to generate second and third leukemic cobblestone areas (L-CAs) in serial replating experiments, while control cultures could be sequen-tially passaged for more than 4 times, indicating that reintroduction of C/EBP impaired the self-renewal capacity of the leukemic CD 34 compartment.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the subject of cell-cell interaction. Our body is {{composed}} of cells, most of them are integrated in a network with other cells that together forms tissues and organs. Every cell type in these complex organs has its special task and location. This is true whether we are doing research on humans or, as we have been, investigating mice. Mice are excellent models for studies of blood cell development since this process in mice resembles human blood cell generation in many regards. Cells communicate with each other by sending out small molecules or by directly binding to surrounding cells; to cells of the same kind as well as to cells with different origins and tasks. A cell is surrounded by hundreds of different signal-carrying entities; soluble, bound to the extra cellular matrix or bound to its surface. Every cell has to distinguish and respond to the environment according to its own specific nature. In the first article interleukin 7 (IL- 7) a growth factor expressed by the stroma cells was studied. Results show that IL- 7 is crucial for the immature progenitor cell in its development towards antibody producing B-lymphocytes. The second article is about stroma cells and their ability to support the development of B-cells. It is a comparative study on two different cell lines, where we focus on transcription factors and their regulation of protein induction of factors supporting B-cells. This study increased our knowledge of stroma cells. In the third paper we combined our knowledge from the first two papers in regard to stroma cells as well as B-cell development by testing if there is a possibility to theoretically find new factors of importance for the maturing B-cell. We achieved this by the development of GCINT, a database investigating possible receptorligand interactions between two cells, verifying these results in vitro with cell lines as well as primary cells. This revealed a two way communication between blood cells and stroma cells, highlighting the complexity of the bone marrow environment.

40|$|Valvular {{interstitial}} cells (VICs) are {{the main}} population of cells found in cardiac valves. These resident fibroblastic cells play important roles in maintaining proper valve function, and their dysregulation {{has been linked to}} disease progression in humans. Despite the critical functions of VICs, their cellular composition is still not well defined for humans and other mammals. Given the limited availability of healthy human valves and the similarity in valve structure and function between humans and pigs, we characterized porcine VICs (pVICs) based on expression of cell surface proteins and sorted a specific subpopulation of pVICs to study its functions. We found that small percentages of pVICs express the progenitor cell markers ABCG 2 (~ 5 %), NG 2 (~ 5 %) or SSEA- 4 (~ 7 %), whereas another subpopulation (~ 5 %) expresses OB-CDH, a type of cadherin expressed by myofibroblasts or osteo-progenitors. pVICs isolated from either aortic or pulmonary valves express most of these protein markers at similar levels. Interestingly, OB-CDH, NG 2 and SSEA- 4 all label distinct valvular subpopulations relative to each other; however, NG 2 and ABCG 2 are co-expressed in the same cells. ABCG 2 (+) cells were further characterized and found to deposit more calcified matrix than ABCG 2 (-) cells upon osteogenic induction, suggesting that they may be involved in the development of osteogenic VICs during valve pathology.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 Very {{little is}} known about the {{environmental}} contamination, due to soiled clinical linens, of hospital laundry facilities. To study this environment, an exposure assessment was performed at an industrial clinical laundry facility in Seattle, WA, USA. Surface swab samples (n= 240) from the environment were collected from the facility over four time periods in 2015. These samples were cultured for three pathogens; Clostridium difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Isolates were characterized by various methods including antibiotic resistance, presence of toxin producing genes, Multilocus sequence typing, 16 S sequencing and/or SCCmec typing. Voluntary participation among the employees consisted of nasal swabs for detection of MRSA, observations during their work and questionnaires. Odds of finding surface contamination with ≥ 1 pathogen were calculated. Contamination with all three pathogens was observed in the facility in both dirty and clean areas. The dirty area had a higher odds ratio than the clean area for overall contamination (≥ 1 pathogen) (OR= 18. 0). The odds ratios of individual pathogen presence varied for C. difficile (OR= 15. 5), MRSA (OR= 14. 8) and VRE (OR= 12. 6). The highest odds of finding surface contamination occurred in the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>sort</b> areas where dirty linens are manually sorted by employees (OR= 63. 0, p< 0. 001). MRSA nasal contamination was identified in 5 / 23 (22 %) employees, with four out of five working in the dirty area. Improved protocols for prevention and reduction of environmental contamination as well as occupational exposure were implemented as a result of this study...|$|R
40|$|Altered {{secretion}} {{of insulin}} {{as well as}} glucagon has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes (T 2 D), but the mechanisms controlling glucagon secretion from alpha-cells largely remain unresolved. Therefore, we studied the regulation of glucagon secretion from alpha TC 1 - 6 (alpha TC 1 clone 6) cells and compared it with insulin release from INS- 1 832 / 13 cells. We found that INS- 1 832 / 13 and alpha TC 1 - 6 cells respectively secreted insulin and glucagon concentration-dependently in response to glucose. In contrast, tight coupling of glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism was observed only in INS- 1 832 / 13 cells. Although glycolytic metabolism was similar in the two cell lines, TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle metabolism, respiration and ATP levels were less glucose-responsive in alpha TC 1 - 6 cells. Inhibition of the malate-aspartate shuttle, using phenyl succinate (PhS), abolished glucose-provoked ATP production and hormone secretion from alpha TC 1 - 6 but not INS- 1 832 / 13 cells. Blocking the malate-aspartate shuttle increased levels of glycerol 3 -phosphate only in INS- 1 832 / 13 cells. Accordingly, relative expression of constituents in the glycerol phosphate shuttle compared with malate-aspartate shuttle was lower in alpha TC 1 - 6 cells. Our {{data suggest that the}} glycerol phosphate shuttle augments the malate-aspartate shuttle in INS- 1 832 / 13 but not alpha TC 1 - 6 cells. These results were confirmed in mouse islets, where PhS abrogated secretion of glucagon but not insulin. Furthermore, expression of the rate-limiting enzyme of the glycerol phosphate shuttle was higher in <b>sorted</b> <b>primary</b> beta-than in alpha-cells. Thus, suppressed glycerol phosphate shuttle activity in the alpha-cell may prevent a high rate of glycolysis and consequently glucagon secretion in response to glucose. Accordingly, pyruvate-and lactate-elicited glucagon secretion remains unaffected since their signalling is independent of mitochondrial shuttles...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 The Forest Homestead Act of 1906 precipitated one of {{the final}} rushes for free land in American history. A nascent land {{management}} agency, the USDA Forest Service, created a systematized process for the review and documentation of purported forest homestead claims. One hundred years later, the forest-homestead examination files of the then-Crater National Forest (now the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest) in southwestern Oregon provide an historical record that exposes the motivations and actions of numerous individuals as they negotiated the steps entailed in the public-land-disposal process. Archival research and archaeological survey form the dual methodological approaches to determine answers to several questions, among them: who were the people who attempted forest homesteading in a rugged mountainous setting, and what were their <b>primary</b> motivations?; what <b>sort</b> of housing did they fashion for themselves in the higher slopes of the Cascade Range and Siskiyou Mountains; where upon the land did they choose to place their habitation areas?; what were the spatial arrangements of those habitation areas?; and, what today {{is the nature of}} the archaeological record of the forest homesteading phenomenon of the early 20 th century? This research indicates that the high-volume timber lands of the southern Cascades and the rugged Siskiyou Mountains proved a singular enticement to the residents of Jackson County, Oregon. Vernacular housing was typically the standby structure of the American 'pioneer' [...] -the log cabin [...] -often ineptly built, sparsely furnished, and infrequently occupied. The would-be homesteaders' actual use of the land was light, often less than one per cent of the total 160 acres they each claimed. The archaeology and history of southwestern Oregon in the early 20 th century demonstrates that forest homesteading was less an agricultural endeavor than a speculative pursuit to gain free land. And everyone [...] -men and women, farmers and teachers, doctors and lawyers [...] -wanted free land...|$|R
40|$|The {{peptide hormone}} Urocortin 3 (Ucn 3) is abundantly and {{exclusively}} expressed in mouse pancreatic beta cells where it regulates insulin secretion. Here we demonstrate that Ucn 3 first appears at embryonic day (E) 17. 5 and, from approximately postnatal day (p) 7 and onwards throughout adult life, becomes a unifying and exclusive feature of mouse beta cells. These observations identify Ucn 3 {{as a potential}} beta cell maturation marker. To determine whether Ucn 3 is similarly restricted to beta cells in humans, we conducted comprehensive immunohistochemistry and gene expression experiments on macaque and human pancreas and <b>sorted</b> <b>primary</b> human islet cells. This revealed that Ucn 3 is not restricted to the beta cell lineage in primates, but is also expressed in alpha cells. To substantiate these findings, we analyzed human embryonic stem cell (hESC) -derived pancreatic endoderm that differentiates into mature endocrine cells upon engraftment in mice. Ucn 3 expression in hESC-derived grafts increased robustly upon differentiation into mature endocrine cells and localized to both alpha and beta cells. Collectively, these observations confirm that Ucn 3 is expressed in adult beta cells in both mouse and human and appears late in beta cell differentiation. Expression of Pdx 1, Nkx 6. 1 and PC 1 / 3 in hESC-derived Ucn 3 (+) beta cells supports this. However, the expression of Ucn 3 in primary and hESC-derived alpha cells demonstrates that human Ucn 3 is not exclusive to the beta cell lineage but is a general marker for both the alpha and beta cell lineages. Ucn 3 (+) hESC-derived alpha cells do not express Nkx 6. 1, Pdx 1 or PC 1 / 3 {{in agreement with the}} presence of a separate population of Ucn 3 (+) alpha cells. Our study highlights important species differences in Ucn 3 expression, which have implications for its utility as a marker to identify mature beta cells in (re) programming strategies...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of standardized {{tests in the}} United States has produced a situation unique in history. Never before has a society so conscientiously sought to evaluate the abilities and characteristics of its members. Our society has sought not only to evaluate but also to provide each member with opportunities in accordance with these evaluated abilities and characteristics. To implement this policy, the nation has given to the schools the <b>primary</b> responsibility for <b>sorting</b> and training its manpower. The schools have done this by turning to standardized tests, particularly since World War I. Although the use of tests has increased rapidly throughout this cen tury, it has been particularly pronounced in the last 15 years in the public schools. It was estimated in 1954 that more than 75 million standardized tests were being taken by 25 million persons in educational institutions (Wrightstone, 1954). This figure had risen to 100 million ability tests a year by 1961 (Goslin, 1963). More recent estimates of 150 million to 250 million tests a year have been common (Brim, Goslin, Glass, & Goldberg, 1964; Goslin, 1963; Joint Committee on Testing, 1962). In {{view of the fact}} that there were approximately 45 million elementary and secondary school children during this period, this represents three to five standardized tests per pupil per year. A recent survey of school principals indicated that testing is not an isolated phenomenon; the principals all reported that some standardized tests were given in their schools each year (Goslin, 1967 b). Of 714 elementary school principals in the Russell Sage sample (discussed later), only one reported that his school neither had nor had plans to initiate a standardized testing program (Goslin, Epstein, & Hallock, 1965). In addi tion, the Coleman survey (Coleman, 1966) reported over 90 % of the nation's pupils in schools where intelligence and achievement tests were given at both the elementary and secondary levels. Besides internal testing programs, external testing programs, e. g., th...|$|R
