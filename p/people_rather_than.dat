5|$|Northern dialects tend to {{have fewer}} {{classifiers}} than southern ones. 個 ge is the only classifier found in the Dungan language. All nouns could have just one classifier in some dialects, such as Shanghainese (Wu), the Mandarin dialect of Shanxi, and Shandong dialects. Some dialects such as Northern Min, certain Xiang dialects, Hakka dialects, and some Yue dialects use 隻 for the noun referring to <b>people,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> 個.|$|E
5|$|Carolyn Porco of NASA was {{consulted}} on {{the planetary}} science and imagery. The animators realistically recreated what an explosion {{would look like}} in space: short blasts, which suck inward and leave debris from a ship floating. For shots of an imploding planet, the same explosion program was used to simulate it breaking up, while the animators could manually composite multiple layers of rocks and wind sucking into the planet. Unlike other Star Trek films and series, the transporter beam effects swirl rather than speckle. Abrams conceived the redesign to emphasize the notion of transporters as beams that can pick up and move <b>people,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> a signal composed of scrambled atoms.|$|E
5|$|Development began {{shortly after}} the release of Christmas Nights in November 1996. Producer Yuji Naka wanted to create a game which {{involved}} saving <b>people</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> killing them. Sonic Team chose to connect the game with firefighting as they thought it was an effective way of having players identify with heroism. Burning Rangers received mostly positive reviews. Critics unanimously commended the game's soundtrack and audio, with the voice navigation system receiving particular praise. The response to the graphics was mixed, with some critics asserting that it had the best visuals on the Saturn, although it was noted for its poor collision detection and occasional glitching. The game was among the final five Saturn titles released in America.|$|E

50|$|The {{perception}} of war {{began to change}} after the French Revolution.

5|$|Judging by his {{achievements}} alone, {{he must have}} been a remarkable man. He had enormous drive, an ability to remain calm despite enormous pressures, and extreme skill in organisation. He was a man of honour who always kept his word and his promise. He had no interest in public honours and refused invitations to stand for Parliament. Although he accepted honours from France and Austria, he mislaid the medals and had to request duplicates to please his wife. His great-great-grandson considers that he was successful because he inspired <b>people</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> drove them.|$|E
5|$|Additional Native resentment {{resulted}} from Amherst's decision in February 1761 {{to cut back}} on the gifts given to the Native Americans. Gift giving had been {{an integral part of the}} relationship between the French and the tribes of the pays d'en haut. Following a Native American custom that carried important symbolic meaning, the French gave presents (such as guns, knives, tobacco, and clothing) to village chiefs, who in turn redistributed these gifts to their people. By this process, the village chiefs gained stature among their people, and were thus able to maintain the alliance with the French. Amherst, however, considered this process to be a form of bribery that was no longer necessary, especially since he was under pressure to cut expenses after the war with France. Many Native Americans regarded this change in policy as an insult and an indication that the British looked upon them as conquered <b>people</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> as allies.|$|E
5|$|The term {{attachment}} {{disorder is}} used to describe emotional and behavioral problems of young children, and also applied to school-age children, teenagers and adults. The specific difficulties implied depend on {{the age of the}} individual being assessed, and a child's attachment-related behaviors may be very different with one familiar adult than with another, suggesting that the disorder is within the relationship and interactions of the two <b>people</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> an aspect of one or the other personality. No list of symptoms can legitimately be presented but generally the term attachment disorder refers to the absence or distortion of age appropriate social behaviors with adults. For example, in a toddler, attachment-disordered behavior could include a failure to stay near familiar adults in a strange environment or to be comforted by contact with a familiar person, whereas in a six-year-old attachment-disordered behavior might involve excessive friendliness and inappropriate approaches to strangers.|$|E

It analyses the limits of definition of an audience.|$|R
5|$|Castro {{believed}} in the need for reform if Cuban socialism was {{to survive in a}} world now dominated by capitalist free markets. In October 1991, the Fourth Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held in Santiago, at which a number of important changes to the government were announced. Castro would step down as head of government, to be replaced by the much younger Carlos Lage, although Castro would remain the head of the Communist Party and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. Many older members of government were to be retired and replaced by their younger counterparts. A number of economic changes were proposed, and subsequently put to a national referendum. Free farmers' markets and small-scale private enterprises would be legalized in an attempt to stimulate economic growth, while U.S. dollars were also made legal tender. Certain restrictions on emigration were eased, allowing more discontented Cuban citizens to move to the United States. Further democratization was to be brought in by having the National Assembly's members elected directly by the <b>people,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> through municipal and provincial assemblies. Castro welcomed debate between proponents and opponents of the reforms, although over time he began to increasingly sympathise with the opponent's positions, arguing that such reforms must be delayed.|$|E

50|$|German {{nationalism}} {{emerged as}} a strong force after 1807 as Napoleon conquered much of Germany and brought in the new ideals of the French Revolution.

25|$|On 7 May an {{amendment}} to the Turkish constitution, allowing the president to be elected directly by the <b>people</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> by a parliamentary vote, was passed by 350 votes to 56.

25|$|The Supreme Court {{rejected}} the compact theory in several nineteenth century cases, undermining {{the basis for}} the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions. In cases such as Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, McCulloch v. Maryland, and Texas v. White, the Court asserted that the Constitution was established directly by the <b>people,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> being a compact among the states. Abraham Lincoln also {{rejected the}} compact theory saying the Constitution was a binding contract among the states and no contract can be changed unilaterally by one party.|$|E
25|$|Typically, for {{a smaller}} {{executive}} car, there is ample room up front for the driver and passenger to sit comfortably, with very comfortable seats. However, rear seat passengers may find the design restrictive in overall room. The 156 Sportwagon features the addition of fold down rear seats which increases the luggage area normally covered by a privacy screen. Ideally the 156 is a car for four <b>people,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> five, although later models did add a full centre seatbelt {{in place of the}} lap belt in earlier models.|$|E
25|$|O'Neill {{followed}} Shane's {{policy of}} arming the <b>people,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> relying as Turlough had done upon Scots mercenary soldiers, such as redshanks or Irish professionals employed under buannacht. This policy {{allowed him to}} field an impressive force, with cavaliers and gunpowder supplied from Spain and Scotland, and in 1595 he gave the crown authorities a shock by ambushing and routing a small English army at the Battle of Clontibret. He and other clan chiefs then offered the crown of Ireland to Philip II of Spain who refused it.|$|E
25|$|The South Florida {{construction}} boom {{brought a}} new wave of immigrants in the past few decades. Central Americans have added a Hispanic aspect to Lake Worth's culture.

Adding to the racial and linguistic mix of the city is a large Haitian population, speaking Haitian Creole and French.|$|R
25|$|Francis {{says that}} we must say “no to a {{financial}} system which rules <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> serves. Behind this attitude lurks a rejection of ethics and a rejection of God” (EG 57). He calls it “increasingly intolerable that financial markets are shaping the destiny of <b>peoples</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> serving their needs, or that the few derive immense wealth from financial speculation while the many are deeply burdened by the consequences”. He adds that speculation in agricultural commodities is “a scandal which seriously compromises access to food {{on the part of}} the poorest members of our human family”.|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} {{structure of the}} Athabaskan language family is complex, and its exact shape is still a hotly debated issue among experts. The conventional three-way split into Northern, Pacific Coast, and Southern is essentially based on geography and the physical distribution of Athabaskan <b>peoples</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> sound linguistic comparisons. Despite this inadequacy, current comparative Athabaskan literature demonstrates that most Athabaskanists still use the three-way geographic grouping <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> any of the proposed linguistic groupings given below, because none of them has been widely accepted. This situation will presumably change as both documentation {{and analysis of the}} languages improves.|$|R
25|$|On 10 May further {{amendments}} to the Turkish constitution were officially passed by parliament, 376 to 1.

The president will now be elected by the <b>people</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> the parliament.

25|$|On 11 May {{when asked}} about the {{amendments}} to the Turkish constitution, which now allow the president to be elected directly by the <b>people</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> by a parliamentary vote, Gül announced that his candidacy is ongoing, despite stating on 6 May that he had withdrawn his candidacy. YÖK president Dr. Erdoğan Teziç, who survived an assassination attempt on 25 April 2007 criticized the AKP heavily, stating that they do not just seek political power but also increased government power and also are trying to use YÖK to this end.|$|E
25|$|James L. Richardson {{identified}} five central {{themes in}} Locke's writing: individualism, consent, {{the concepts of}} the rule of law and government as trustee, the significance of property and religious toleration. Although Locke did not develop a theory of natural rights, he envisioned individuals in the state of nature as being free and equal. The individual, rather than the community or institutions, was the point of reference. Locke believed that individuals had given consent to government and therefore authority derived from the <b>people</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> from above. This belief would influence later revolutionary movements.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{exception}} of the Mossi states to its south, the Mali Empire faced very few external threats throughout its existence.

[...] For the next 150 years, the Mali Empire would be locked in a life or death struggle for its very existence amid a barrage of enemies on all sides.|$|R
2500|$|As the Romans {{extended}} their dominance throughout the Mediterranean world, their policy in general was {{to absorb the}} deities and cults of other <b>peoples</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> try to eradicate them, since they believed that preserving tradition promoted social stability. One way that Rome incorporated diverse peoples was by supporting their religious heritage, building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local gods.|$|R

The European colonial powers felt it was their duty to bring Western civilization to what they perceived as backward <b>peoples.</b> <b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> merely govern colonial peoples, the Europeans would attempt to Westernize them in accordance with a colonial ideology known as [...] "assimilation".|$|R
