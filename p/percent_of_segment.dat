40|$|Latin America and the Caribbean is {{the most}} violent region in the world, with an annual {{homicide}} {{rate of more than}} 20 per 100, 000 population and with an increasing trend. Yet most evidence of crime concentration, geo-temporal patterns, and event dependence comes from cities in high-income countries. Understanding crime patterns in the region and how they compare to those in high-income countries is of first-order importance to formulate crime reduction policies. This paper is the first to analyze crime patterns of cities in five Latin American countries. Using micro-geographic units of analysis, the paper finds, first, that crime in Latin America is highly concentrated in a small proportion <b>of</b> blocks: 50 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> crimes are concentrated in 3 to 7. 5 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> street <b>segments,</b> and 25 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> crimes are concentrated in 0. 5 to 2. 9 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> street <b>segments.</b> This validates Weisburd's "law of crime concentration at place" (Weisburd, 2105). These figures are fairly constant over time but sensitive to major police reforms. The second finding is that hot spots of crime are not always persistent. Crime is constantly prevalent in certain areas, but in other areas hot spots either appear or disappear, suggesting a possible rational adaptation from criminals to police actions that cause crime displacement in the medium run to other areas. Finally, the paper finds a significant pattern of repeated crime victimization in location and time for property crimes. There are striking similarities with the developed world in crime concentration, although crime levels are much higher and usually increasing. There are also some differences in terms of the persistence of hot spots that pose interesting policy implications and avenues for future research...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess {{myocardial}} metabolic activity in the area of reverse redistribution and determine the prognostic value of reverse redistribution and PET imaging. Re verse redistribution is thought to be a manifestation of reperfu-sion therapy and associated with a favorable clinical outcome. Preliminary observations from the Thrombolysis and Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) trial suggest that reverse redistribution is asso ciated with higher incidence of future cardiac events. Methods: Thirty-two patients with chronic coronary artery disease and reverse redistribution on planar thallium scintigraphy had PET 13 NHg/ 18 FDG imaging. Radionuclide angiocardiography was performed in 23 patients. Results: Fifty segments showed re verse redistribution on planar thallium images; 19 segments had normal 13 NH 3 and 18 FDG uptake and 17 were ischemie by PET criteria. Thus, a total of 72 % (36 of 50) <b>of</b> reverse redistribution <b>segments</b> were PET viable. Sixty-one <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>segments</b> with abnormal regional wall motion and reverse redistribution were PET scar. On follow-up, 31 % (10 / 32) had a cardiac event (nine unstable angina and one myocardial infarction). Fifty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> patients (5 / 10) with cardiac events had severe reverse redistri bution and PET viability versus 9 % (2 / 22) without cardiac events (p = 0. 01). Conclusions: The majority of thallium reverse re distribution segments was PET viable as judged by 18 FDG up take. Viability in areas of reverse redistribution is not inferred by regional wall motion analysis. Regional PET viability identifies patients with reverse redistribution with a higher likelihood of future cardiovascular events. PET viability assessment may be helpful with the impact of reverse redistribution on planar thallium scintigraphy. Key Words: coronary artery disease; prognosis;imaging; me tabolis...|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} with chronic ischemic myocardial dysfunction, late gadolinium enhancement CMR (LGE-CMR) accurately depicts the regional extent of fibrosis and predicts functional recovery after revascularization. We hypothesized that the predictive accuracy of LGE-CMR could be optimized by not only {{taking into account the}} transmural extent of hyperenhancement but also the amount of residual, non-enhanced viable myocardium, and procedure related necrosis. We studied 45 {{patients with}} chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction, who underwent cine and LGE-CMR 1 month before and 3 months after surgical or percutaneous revascularization. Segmental and global function, scar, presence of a significant residual viable rim (defined as ≥ 4. 5 mm), and procedure related necrosis were fully quantified using standardized methods and objective thresholds. Sixty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>segments</b> without hyperenhancement showed functional improvement at follow-up. No improvement was observed in segments with > 75 % segmental extent of hyperenhancement (SEH), while segments with 1 - 25 %, 26 - 50 %, and 51 - 75 % SEH were 4, 8, and 20 times less likely to improve (multilevel analysis, p < 0. 001). Thickness of the viable rim largely paralleled total wall thickness; therefore, the presence of a significant viable rim did not provide additional diagnostic value beyond SEH. Procedure related necrosis was found in 12 (27 %) patients. The presence of procedure related necrosis was the only (negative) predictor of changes in left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction. In conclusion, we found that functional outcome after revascularization was influenced by both transmural extent of hyperenhancement and procedure related necrosis. However, the presence of a significant residual, viable rim was of no additional diagnostic value. Copyright © 2007 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc...|$|R

40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we present}} a comprehensive method to extract connected planar polygons from a range image acquired by a laser range camera. The result is a boundary representation of the objects in the scene. The approximation of the detected planes by three–dimensional polygons {{can be used as}} a source for feature–based registration of sequential range images. We focus on the processing of range images that are segmented into planar regions. The polygon of each plane is extracted by incremental line fitting on the 2 D contour <b>of</b> the <b>segmented</b> region projected onto the xy–plane followed by the propagation to the corresponding 3 D–plane. We present a novel idea for joining these three–dimensional polygons. Due to sparsely distributed depth values of inclined planes and noise in areas of object edges, some planes cannot be segmented completely. Therefore object edges that actually represent one edge drift apart in 3 D. Such edges are detected and joined. The direction in which each edge is moved, is determined by a confidence measure, depending on the slope of the plane. We describe our experiments on range data of scenes containing planar as well as curved surfaces and give quantitative results. The estimates are compared to measurements that were manually taken. For cubic objects we compare the angles of the estimated polygons to the expected orthogonality. For approximately 70 planar surface patches we get an average error of 5 degrees. 83 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> successfully <b>segmented</b> lines are joint correctly by the algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The HIV {{epidemic}} has posed major, almost insurmountable, {{challenges to}} tuberculosis control efforts across the world. This study analyzes the prevalence and disease profile of HIV/AIDS coinfection in Vadodara, Gujarat, India. Materials and Methods: This {{study was conducted}} in the HIV Referral Clinic at Vadodara, India. Using convenience sampling method, 246 HIV-positive patients coinfected with tuberculosis were enrolled. A detailed history of every case was taken followed by a thorough physical examination. Baseline and follow up laboratory and radiological investigations were carried out as appropriately warranted. Results: Out of 500 HIV positive patients who presented to the clinic during the study period, 246 (49. 2 &#x 0025;) were coinfected with tuberculosis. Out of 246 coinfected cases, 35 (14. 2 &#x 0025;) presented with demonstrable and documented tuberculosis whereas in 211 (85. 8 &#x 0025;) cases, tuberculosis was extemporaneously detected by actively screening the patients. Sixty nine <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> patients were males, while 10. 5 &#x 0025; of cases were below fifteen years of age. The majority (68 &#x 0025;) of patients had manifestations of extrapulmonary tuberculosis; but pulmonary tuberculosis, which is a more common presentation in HIV-negative cases, was present in only fifty five <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> this <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> the population. Abdominal tuberculosis was the most common site (74 &#x 0025;) amongst extrapulmonary tuberculosis involvement, followed by clinically palpable lymph nodes (22 &#x 0025;) and pleural effusion (17 &#x 0025;). Conclusion: The prevalence of tuberculosis in HIV-positive patients in this study (49 &#x 0025;) was substantially higher than that reported in previous studies. However, this could be attributed to a selection and/or a diagnosis bias. This study used abdominal ultrasound for the diagnosis of tuberculosis which might have obviously increased the prevalence.

We present a high-resolution genome-tiling array-based profile of replication timing for ∼ 1 % of the human genome studied by The ENCODE Project Consortium. Twenty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the investigated <b>segments</b> replicate asynchronously (pan-S). These areas are rich in genes and CpG islands, features they share with early-replicating loci. Interphase FISH showed that pan-S replication is a consequence of interallelic variation in replication time and is not an artifact derived from a specific cell cycle synchronization method or from aneuploidy. The interallelic variation in replication time is likely due to interallelic variation in chromatin environment, because while the early- or late-replicating areas were exclusively enriched in activating or repressing histone modifications, respectively, the pan-S areas had both types of histone modification. The replication profile of the chromosomes identified contiguous chromosomal <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> hundreds of kilobases separated by smaller segments where the replication time underwent an acute transition. Close examination <b>of</b> one such <b>segment</b> demonstrated that the delay of replication time was accompanied by a decrease in level of gene expression and appearance of repressive chromatin marks, suggesting that the transition segments are boundary elements separating chromosomal domains with different chromatin environments...|$|R

Sixty-six <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> hypocotyl <b>segments</b> and 10. 4 % <b>of</b> cotyledon <b>segments</b> produced adventitious shoots, with a mean number of adventitious shoots per explant of 3. 5 ± 0. 9 and 2. 5 ± 1. 5, respectively. The best regeneration medium (52 % shoot formation; 47 % shoot elongation) for hypocotyls was MS basal medium containing 22. 2 μM BA plus 0. 5 μM TDZ, producing a mean of 3. 9 ± 0. 4 adventitious shoots. Adventitious shoots were established as proliferating shoot cultures following transfer to MS medium with Gamborg B 5 vitamins supplemented with 10 μMBA plus 10 μMTDZ. For in vitro rooting, woody plant medium with indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) at 0, 2. 9, 5. 7, or 8. 6 μM in combination with 4. 9 μM indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) was tested for a 5 - or 10 -d dark culture period, followed by culture under a 16 -h photoperiod.

40|$|Quantitative {{description}} of foreign body giant cell (FBGC) formation on implanted polymer surfaces {{as a function}} of time can conceivably correlate cell adhesion with polymer properties and possibly predict the behavior of the polymer in vivo. In the present study, the formation of FBGCs on various biomedical polymers was quantified by two parameters: the density of adherent macrophages present initially that participate in FBGC formation (d 0) and the rate constant for cell fusion (k); both kinetic parameters were used to calculate the time-dependent FBGC density (dfc). The materials used were: three Pellethane poly(etherurethanes) (PEUs) varying in weight <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> hard <b>segment,</b> one poly(etherurethane urea) (PEUU), and NHLBI-DTB primary reference materials: low density polyethylene (LDPE), silica-free polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The results indicated that up to 5 weeks of implantation, FBGCs were formed from the fusion of one population of adherent macrophages present by 3 days post-implantation. Furthermore, only a small fraction (< 8 %) of this initial adherent macrophage population participated in FBGC formation. Based on the results of previous studies and the current study, it was concluded that increase in PEU hard segment weight percent, surface hardness and hydrophobicity increased total protein adsorption and effectively increased d 0 and dfc. No further correlations between the material properties of all polymers and the cell kinetics can be made at this time. However, this study demonstrated that macrophage adhesion and FBGC formation can be quantified with the cell fusion model, and are modulated by various polymer properties.

For the analysis, the myocardium was divided into 17 segments. A visual semi-quantitative analysis was carried out according to the following score indicating radiotracer uptake: O = normal to 4 = absent. Myocardial viability was defined as the presence of normal, mildly or moderately reduced radiotracer uptake. The scores obtained by PET were compared to those obtained in SPECT. A statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS v. 10. Results: 391 segments were analyzed. PET detected viability in 130 segments that had been defined as non-viable by SPECT. No differences in the analysis by vascular territories were found. Thirty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>segments</b> that were defined as non viable by SPECT were viable by PET, meanwhile only 1 % <b>of</b> the <b>segments</b> detected viable by SPECT were considered non viable with PET.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} if oblique angulation {{of the image}} intensifier is adequate to image {{the entire length of}} the common iliac artery during endovascular aneurysm repair or if additional caudal tilt is necessary. Methods: Using a 3 D workstation, the apparent level of the iliac bifurcation (distal limit of the stent-graft) was determined on computed tomographic angiography by profiling the common iliac segment in oblique angulation only and repeated with a combination of oblique angulation and caudal tilt. Two independent observers measured twice the apparent length <b>of</b> the iliac <b>segment</b> in both profiles for 50 patients according to a set protocol. Intra- and interobserver variability was calculated using the Bland and Altman method; the differences between the two different profiles were tested using paired t tests. Results: Of the 50 CTA datasets reviewed, 2 datasets were excluded owing to extensive calcification of the iliac system that prevented accurate interpretation of the image. <b>Of</b> the 96 <b>segments</b> studied, the iliac segments appeared longer (better profiled) with a combination of caudal tilt and oblique angulation in 80 %, with an average discrepancy of 9 mm for observer 1 (range 21 to + 28) and 7 mm for observer 2 (0 to + 26). The effect of caudal tilt was statistically significant for individual observers (p 50. 001 and 0. 024, respectively). Forty-six <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> iliac <b>segments</b> measured by observer 1 and 35 % by observer 2 showed that the addition of caudal tilt resulted in improved profiling by at least 10 mm. Although inter- and intraobserver variation was significant, the gain in apparent iliac length with the addition of caudal tilt was preserved. Conclusion: When profiled with oblique angulation alone, the location of the iliac bifurcation may appear higher than its true location, resulting in underutilization <b>of</b> the iliac <b>segment</b> by. 10 mm in over a third of the patients.

40|$|Although {{numerous}} {{agents have}} been shown experimentally to protect ischemic myocardium, a critical unanswered question is whether function is preserved in the salvaged tissue. Accordingly, 38 openchest dogs had measurements <b>of</b> <b>percent</b> <b>segment</b> length shortening (%SS) and velocity <b>of</b> <b>segment</b> length shortening either in midmyocardial or subepicardial and subendocardial ischemic segments before and after 60 min of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion during 5 h of reperfusion; 10 additional dogs were subjected to 3 h of coronary occlusion followed by 72 h of reperfusion. 15 min after coronary artery occlusion, radiolabeled microspheres were injected into the left atrium for measurement of regional myocardial blood flow, and dogs were treated with 1 mg/kg i. v. (n = 23) of an anti-inflammatory drug, flurbiprofen or an equal volume of saline (n = 25). The ischemic myocardium-at-risk for necrosis was determined by injecting methylene blue dye into the left atrium with the coronary artery reoccluded {{at the end of}} the reperfusion period, slicing the left ventricle into thin transverse sections, and measuring the areas of each slice that were not perfused (pink unstained tissue) by methylene blue. The quantity of necrotic tissue in each transverse section was measured by planimetry after incubation of the slices in triphenyltetrazolium chloride, and by direct histological examination in dogs with 72 h of reperfusion...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{mechanisms}} and roles of vascular structural changes {{during the development}} of hypertension, we coarcted or sham-coarcted the abdominal aorta of rats. At intervals of 3 to 56 days later, we obtained standardized <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> thoracic and abdominal aortas for measure-ment of dry weight, water content, and amino acid content. Carotid arterial pressure was elevated by day 5 in coarcted rats and remained elevated. Femoral and tail arterial pressures remained normal. Cardiac ventricular weight and dry weight of the thoracic aorta, normalized for body weight, rose rapidly over 3 - 10 days in coarcted rats, remaining constant at 50 - 60 % above levels in sham-coarcted rats thereafter. In contrast, water content of thoracic aorta in coarcted rats peaked at 123 % of control values on day 7 (p< 0. 001), falling rapidly thereafter to levels about half of peak. Increments in dry weight and water content of the normotenslve abdominal aortic <b>segments</b> were <b>of</b> far lesser magnitude and occurred 1 to 2 weeks later, probably reflecting the effects of initial hypotension <b>of</b> the hindquarters. <b>Percent</b> hydroxyproline <b>of</b> intima-media <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> the thoracic aorta remained normal during the 8 -week period, indicating that increases in aortic dry weight did not represent disproportional fibrosis and thus are attributable to muscular hypertrophy. These results provide support for the hypothesis tha...|$|R
