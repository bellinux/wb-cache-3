Under a specific informational framework, we derive the asymmetric combinatorial equilibrium bidding strategies and show that they exhibit a free-riding effect. We show that this effect is increasing with the level of uncertainty and decreasing with risk aversion. When all the firms are risk neutral or equally risk averse, the magnitude of the free-riding effect is unaffected by the division of the contract chosen by the <b>public</b> <b>buyer.</b> Nevertheless, when each firm exhibits its own risk aversion parameter, we find that the free-riding effect is reduced (resp. increased) as the more risk averse small firm competes for a larger (resp. smaller) part of the contract...|$|E

40|$|We {{show how}} {{repeatedly}} awarded procurement contracts where unverifiable quality dimensions are relevant can be reinterpreted as relational contracts between a buyer and a contractor that {{is threatened by}} a potentially less efficient competitor. We compare two scenarios: 1) Under freedom of choices the (<b>public)</b> <b>buyer</b> freely chooses the contractor, the price and the (unverifiable) quality it should stick to, 2) in a competitive discretionary tendering the buyer evaluates differently the bids of the suppliers {{by means of a}} handicap, based on the firm's past performance. We show that, if firms' costs are common knowledge, relational discriminatory tenderings replicates the results of long term contracting (freedom of choice). The handicap ensures the existence of a relational contract under which the buyer selects the more efficient firm and pays it a price higher than its cost, and the firm delivers the required quality. This outcome is an equilibrium when thecost of quality is not too high, and the players' discount factor and the valuation of quality are not small. A self-enforcing relational contract entails an handicap which is closer to the difference between the firms' specific-cost, the lower is the variable cost of quality and the higher is the players' discount factor. public procurement, relational contracts, unverifiable quality, handicap. ...|$|E

40|$|Unverifiable quality {{may affect}} the {{enforcement}} of procurement contracts even when the award procedure is able to select the most efficient firm in the market. In this paper, we show that a discriminatory competitive mechanism – which awards the contract {{on the basis of}} price and (firms') past performance – yields an efficient allocation of the contract and allows the buyer to implement her desired quality. Quality enforcement arises out of relational contracting whereby the buyer ‘handicaps' a contractor in future competitive tendering processes if it fails to provide the required quality. We study an infinitely repeated procurement model with two firms and one buyer imperfectly informed on the firms' cost, in which, in each period, the buyer runs a discriminatory auction. We restrict our analysis to the case of a buyer committed to her handicapping strategy, a case which captures some of the features of a <b>public</b> <b>buyer.</b> When players use either grim trigger or stick-and-carrot strategies, we find that the buyer can induce the delivery of optimal (unverifiable) quality with a variety of handicap levels and, when applicable, durations of the punishment period; for some values of the handicap and the length of the punishment period, both firms remain active in the market even when punished...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates {{compliance}} with SME-friendly policy in public procurement. Two research questions guide the investigation. The {{first is the}} extent to which policy is being complied with. The results, which are based on 349 <b>public</b> <b>buyer</b> survey responses, reveal compliance to be moderate; indicated by a mean score of 14. 54 out of 22 on the compliance index. The second question concerns the impact of institutional forces on policy compliance. A predictive model informed by institutional theory is used to test these impacts. The model is significant and accounts for 27 per cent of the variance in policy compliance. Perceived consistency of institutional rules in public procurement, compatibility of SME-friendly policy with organisational goals, and organisational dependence on the state positively impact compliance. The constraining effect of SME-friendly policy on professional discretion has a negative effect. While not directly significant, social legitimacy, perceived diffusion of SME-friendly practices and coercion do indirectly influence policy compliance in interaction with procurement experience, procurement involvement and organisation size respectively. A number of contributions arise from this study. Empirically, it provides among the first survey-based insights into what public buyers are doing to facilitate SMEs and the institutional factors that support or inhibit them in doing so. This is important as academic interest in SME-friendly procurement policies has not been matched by evidence on their implementation. Theoretically, it is novel in its application and operationalisation of institutional theory to explicate compliance behaviour in public procurement. Research on this topic has been largely a-theoretical to date. Methodologically, it is responsible for creating the first index of SME-friendly procurement practices. The study contributes to policy-practice by identifying several areas that can act as levers for the more effective translation of SME-friendly policy, including: policy monitoring and the professionalisation of public sector purchasing. The study alights on recommendations to take this line of inquiry forward. Relevant here is examining the effects of policy compliance on SMEs’ participation and success rates in contract competitions, undertaking cross-comparative research and triangulating research methods. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to test the {{relationship}} between firms’ experience of SME-friendly policy and their participation and success in public procurement. Methodology – Hypothesised relationships between SME-friendly policy and three outcome variables - frequency of tendering, success rate in public contract competitions, and commercial orientation towards the public sector - are tested using survey data from 2755 SME respondents. Findings – SME-friendly policy is found to be significant in explaining success rates and commercial orientation towards the public sector marketplace. It is not significant in explaining frequency of tendering. Originality – This study puts forward and tests an original model of SME-friendly procurement policy and its associated outcomes for firms.

Then our empirical findings show that, where the local law courts are inefficient: i) public works are delivered with longer delays, and this applies particularly to higher-value contracts - i. e. complex projects; ii) contracts are more often awarded to larger firms; and iii) on average, a higher share of final payment in contracts is adopted. These results are not driven by omitted environmental variables, since we show that delays in the completion of contracted works are still affected by the efficiency of the local law courts after including province-related fixed effects in the model and considering other possible explanations for our findings...|$|R

Findings: The transition towards PCP can be best described as a learning process which cumulates the knowledge and experience in the client-supplier interaction accompanied by changing contractual and relational capabilities. In public infrastructure this process is not initially motivated by the benefits of value co-creation, but is politically driven. Practical implications: The study proposes three generic transition stages towards increased performance and infrastructural complexity moderated by contract duration. These stages may help managers of public agencies to identify the current procurement level and the contractual and relational challenges they need to master when facing higher levels of performance and infrastructural complexity.

While auctions are the prescribed procedures and the most used ones for public procurement, in the private sector, where buyers are free to choose their purchasing method, competitive tendering {{is far from being}} their preferred option (Bajari et al. 2009).

40|$|Public {{procurement}}, {{the generic}} {{term used to}} refer to procurement contracts (traditional procurement), public service delegations (including concessions) and public private partnerships, currently represents today significant amounts of money as it is believed to account for nearly 15 % of the GDP in France. Whilst the public procurement system must strive to achieve the best possible performance in terms of cost and service, its inefficiency is highlighted on a regular basis. In (actual) fact, substantial gains could be achieved through a more efficient management of the system. The present Note examines potential avenues of action, in the framework of the regulatory changes currently under way at European level, with the aim of increasing the efficiency of the public procurement system. The contracts upon which the public procurement system is based are subject to certain asymmetries of information (in that the company is more familiar with its costs and the economic environment than the public party) and contractual incompleteness (since it is impossible to foresee every possible event that might arise during the execution of the contract). This being the case, the economic analysis recommends that competitive forces be used wherever possible when it comes to selecting partners and that incentive mechanisms be put in place to establish a real commitment of the parties concerned. New European Directives regarding procurement contracts and concessions, approved in 2014 and expected to be transposed by 2016, will give public authorities greater flexibility to negotiate with companies at both the selection stage and the execution stage (renegotiation). We believe this change to be a positive and economically justified one. It is, however, crucial that it be supported by specific terms governing its management that are not currently outlined in the Directives. Our recommendations are based on three key avenues, namely transparency, competition and expertise. The negotiation procedure must be supported by transparent information both prior to and following negotiation. During the execution stage, it must be possible for amendments to contracts to be contested without debilitating the process by facilitating {{an increase in the number}} of futile appeals. We also put forward a number of recommendations designed to encourage greater transparency where public procurement is concerned. For the purposes of intensifying competition at the tendering stage it would be useful to limit the number of electronic information platforms and to merge them towards a high-performance standardised model. At the same time, it is advisable to simplify procedures, to increase the professionalisation of <b>public</b> <b>buyers</b> and to centralise the most standard of purchases in order to benefit from economies of scale and pool the experience of <b>public</b> <b>buyers.</b> Finally, with regards to large-scale projects, we would recommend that a comparative evaluation be performed beforehand in order to determine the most appropriate public procurement tool to meet the needs of the public authorities concerned. The agency responsible for this prior evaluation would also perform ex post evaluations with a view to drawing lessons regarding the various tools and procedures available...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSince the 1980 s, {{policies}} {{related to}} outsourcing have steadily emerged {{in both the}} private sector and public sector. Indeed, the topics of procurement and outsourcing attract a lot of attention from practitioners and researchers alike. In the private sector, there are many studies discussing how to develop an efficient supplier-buyer relationship in order to optimize an outsourcing strategy; however, few studies discuss similar topics for the public sector. In this paper, we discuss the supplier-buyer relationship in public procurement and outsourcing based on four different role expectation segments of private suppliers: operator, agent, professional, and partner. While the role expectation for an operator is emphasized in the execution of a <b>public</b> <b>buyer's</b> request, a role expectation for a partner is more collaborative and involves risk sharing. While the role expectation for an agent is based upon business outsourcing, a role expectation for a professional is based upon a specific task. In addition, the paper also investigates market competition in Taiwan's public procurement and outsourcing based on supplier segmentation. The results show that in the four segments of private suppliers, the market competition for the operator segment is the most competitive because it has the most tenderers in the tendering process; on the other hand, in the cases of finding an agent or a professional, the contract price is positively related to the number of tenderers. These results can help managers in {{the private sector and}} officers in the public sector to understand the market competition of governmental procurement and outsourcing, and also help them optimize the outcome by developing an appropriate public-private relationship...|$|R
