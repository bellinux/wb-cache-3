XI Corps included one motorised artillery regiment comprising four battalions, three machine gun battalions (one motorised, one <b>pack</b> <b>animal</b> and one static), and six Blackshirt legions of battalion size. The Motorised Corps was supported by a motorised artillery regiment consisting of three battalions, and an motorised engineer battalion.|$|E
5|$|On both fronts, {{the horse}} was also used as a <b>pack</b> <b>animal.</b> Because railway lines could not {{withstand}} artillery bombardments, horses carried ammunition and supplies between the railheads and the rear trenches, though the horses generally were not used in the actual trench zone. This role of horses was critical, and thus horse fodder was the single largest commodity shipped to the front by some countries. Following the war, many cavalry regiments were converted to mechanised, armoured divisions, with light tanks developed to perform many of the cavalry's original roles.|$|E
5|$|Julius Caesar {{mentions}} {{small black}} horses that resemble the Mérens in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico (Commentaries on the Gallic War), when discussing {{the defeat of}} Crassus by the Sotiates and their cavalry. Historian Paul Prunet {{was the first to}} link the animals discussed by Caesar to the Mérens, although the relationship has not been definitely established. The location of the Sotiates is the subject of controversy, with some authors placing them in the district of Nerac and others near Foix. The Mérens may have been used as a <b>pack</b> <b>animal</b> by the Romans, who may have taken some of the animals with them when they left. The small black horse from the Pyrenees is described throughout antiquity.|$|E
50|$|Like {{their human}} counterparts, <b>pack</b> <b>animals</b> require special backpacking gear like {{a variety of}} leads, harnesses, and panniers or packs. Dog packs are widely {{available}} in outdoor sporting goods stores. Predators can be attracted to <b>pack</b> <b>animals,</b> so caution is necessary when bringing domesticated animals into backcountry areas. Some trails have permanent corrals that specifically cater to large <b>pack</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|R

25|$|Native American people readily {{integrated}} use of {{the horse}} into their cultures. They quickly adopted the horse as a primary means of transportation. Horses replaced the dog as a <b>pack</b> <b>animal</b> and changed Native cultures in terms of warfare, trade, and even diet—the ability to run down bison allowed some people to abandon agriculture for hunting from horseback.|$|E
25|$|Even as {{the country}} grew even larger with the {{admission}} of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Ohio by 1803, {{the only means of}} transportation between these landlocked western states and their coastal neighbors was by foot, <b>pack</b> <b>animal,</b> or ship. Recognizing the success of Roman roads in unifying that empire, political and business leaders in the United States began to construct roads and canals to connect the disparate parts of the nation.|$|E
25|$|The 17th-century {{road from}} Glasgow to Irvine ran past 'The Hill' farm on the {{opposite}} side to the existing road, which is itself on the line of the 18th-century turnpike. The house used to 'face' the other direction as can be seen by a slight asymmetry in the existing frontage and the old 'front door' is now a just a window, but with 'tell tale' ornamentation on the lintel. Then presence of the road running passed the farm would have made the transport of her cheeses that much easier in those days of transport by <b>pack</b> <b>animal</b> or sledge. Timothy Pont's map of Cunninghame (1604–1608) marks an 'O Hill', emphasising the age of this settlement.|$|E
5000|$|While {{traditional}} {{usage of}} <b>pack</b> <b>animals</b> by nomadic tribespeople is declining, {{a new market}} is growing in the tourist expeditions industry in regions such as the High Atlas mountains of Morocco, allowing visitors the comfort of backpacking with animals.

In {{addition}} to Pedersen, Latham, and Coleman, Lieutenant Bill Riley and Sergeant Elmer Lively were also involved with the training and care of Reckless. Pedersen had his wife ship a pack saddle {{from their home in}} California so Reckless could better fulfill her primary role as a <b>pack</b> <b>animal.</b> The recoilless rifle platoon had its own medical corpsman, Navy Hospitalman First Class George [...] "Doc" [...] Mitchell, who provided the majority of medical care for Reckless.|$|E
500|$|Lycia did not, in {{contrast}} to other Roman provinces, possess a very developed road system. While the north–south traffic was conducted primarily through the few river valleys, the east–west routes led, unlike today, mostly on and along the mountain ridges. This particular road, leading from Limyra over the Alakır Çayı and into the neighbouring region of Pamphylia and Attaleia, must have been of special importance, since the two regions were united in a single province, Lycia et Pamphylia, until the 4thcentury. In comparison to the main arterial roads of the Roman Empire however, the roads of Lycia were, with [...] width, rather modest and confined to pedestrian and <b>pack</b> <b>animal</b> traffic. This is further corroborated {{by the fact that}} no wagon ruts are evident on the paving of the Limyra bridge, nor any traces of a parapet or breastwork.|$|E
500|$|In October 1952, Pedersen {{received}} {{permission from}} Colonel Eustace P. Smoak {{to purchase a}} horse for his platoon. Based in mountainous terrain, Pederson needed a <b>pack</b> <b>animal</b> capable of carrying up to nine of the heavy 24-pound shells needed to supply the recoilless rifles used by his unit, the Recoilless Rifle Platoon of the 5th Marine Regiment. The day after he received permission, on [...] October 26, 1952, Pedersen, Sergeant Willard Berry, and Corporal Philip Carter drove a jeep with a trailer to the Seoul racetrack. Pedersen paid for the horse with his own money. Moon was reluctant to sell the horse, though he needed to, and cried when [...] "Flame" [...] departed. [...] The Marines renamed her [...] "Reckless" [...] as a contraction {{of the name of}} the Recoilless rifle and a nod to the daredevil attitude associated with those who used the gun.|$|E

500|$|For some {{visitors}} {{the greater}} solitude of the backcountry requires using [...] hiking trails to backpacking or horseback riding into more remote destinations such as Blackwater Natural Bridge {{which can be}} accessed from Blackwater Natural Bridge trailhead. There are dozens of trails which total over [...] located throughout the forest. Many of the trailheads can be accessed at campgrounds, with shorter day hikes available as well. The Continental Divide Trail has a [...] section which passes through the forest and crosses the Continental Divide at Sheridan Pass. There is also the Nez Perce National Historic Trail and the Beartooth Loop National Recreation Trail, {{both of which are}} in the northern regions of the forest. Some remote areas can also be accessed by horseback. Trailheads usually provide enough room for horse and <b>pack</b> <b>animal</b> trailers plus personal vehicles. Along forest access roads, all-terrain vehicles (ATV) are allowed, but since wilderness areas do not permit access by way of motorized transport, those who wish to visit such areas usually do so either by hiking in or on horseback.|$|E

2500|$|The {{official}} {{report by}} Sapir-Hen and Ben-Joseph notes that [...] "The {{introduction of the}} dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) as a <b>pack</b> <b>animal</b> to the southern Levant ... substantially facilitated trade across the vast deserts of Arabia, promoting both economic and social change (e.g., Kohler 1984; Borowski 1998: 112–116; Jasmin 2005). This ... has generated extensive discussion regarding {{the date of the}} earliest domestic camel in the southern Levant (and beyond) (e.g., Albright 1949: 207; Epstein 1971: 558–584; Bulliet 1975; Zarins 1989; Köhler-Rollefson 1993; Uerpmann and Uerpmann 2002; Jasmin 2005; 2006; Heide 2010; Rosen and Saidel 2010; Grigson 2012). Most scholars today agree that the dromedary was exploited as a <b>pack</b> <b>animal</b> sometime in the early Iron Age (not before the 12th century BCE)" [...] and concludes that [...] "Current data from copper smelting sites of the Aravah Valley enable us to pinpoint the introduction of domestic camels to the southern Levant more precisely based on stratigraphic contexts associated with an extensive suite of radiocarbon dates. The data indicate that this event occurred not earlier than the last third of the 10th century BCE and most probably during this time. The coincidence of this event with a major reorganization of the copper industry of the region—attributed to the results of the campaign of Pharaoh Shoshenq I—raises the possibility that the two were connected, and that camels were introduced as part of the efforts to improve efficiency by facilitating trade." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pannier tanks, in Britain used almost {{exclusively}} by the Great Western Railway, and also common in Belgium, are box-shaped tanks {{carried on the}} sides of the boiler like a pannier is carried by <b>pack</b> <b>animal.</b> Unlike the side tank, they do not go all the way down and there is space between the tank and the running plate. The pannier arrangement lowers the centre of gravity compared to a saddle tank, whilst still allowing easy access to the inside motion that the latter gave. [...] The first Great Western pannier tanks were actually converted from saddle tank locomotives when these were being rebuilt in the early 1900s with the Belpaire firebox. There were difficulties in accommodating the flat top of the latter within an encircling saddle tank which cut down capacity and increased the tendency to overheat the water in the tank. In Belgium, pannier tanks were in use at least since 1866, once again in conjunction with Belpaire firebox locomotives built for the Belgian State and for la Société Générale d'Exploitatation (SGE), a private company grouping smaller secondary lines. Pannier tank locomotives are often seen as iconic of the GWR.|$|E
