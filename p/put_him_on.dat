5|$|During spring {{training}} with the Nationals, Doug developed a strained lat muscle {{on his right}} side that <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the disabled list to start the 2014 season. He returned on May 9 against the Oakland Athletics where he gave up 5 earned runs on 9 hits in 4.1 innings. He bounced back in his next start, against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Fister gave up just 1 earned run on 5 hits in 7 innings.|$|E
5|$|Fischer {{gained a}} far higher rating than any player in history {{up to that}} time. On the July 1972 FIDE rating list, his Elo rating of 2785 was 125 points above (World No. 2) Spassky's rating of 2660. His results <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the cover of Life magazine, and allowed him to {{challenge}} World Champion Boris Spassky, whom he had never beaten (+0−3=2).|$|E
5|$|The Giants rallied {{and won the}} {{following}} week against the Minnesota Vikings before facing the Buffalo Bills in their regular season home finale. Despite holding the Bills' powerful offense to 17 points, the Giants lost 17–13, for their third loss in four games. To compound the team's problems, Phil Simms suffered a broken foot that <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the sidelines {{for the rest of}} the season. His replacement, Jeff Hostetler, had been with the team since 1984, but had thrown just 68 passes coming into the season.|$|E

5|$|The Second Doctor {{was portrayed}} by Patrick Troughton, whose serials were more action-oriented {{than those of}} his predecessor. Additionally, after The Highlanders, stories {{moved away from the}} purely {{historical}} ones that featured during William Hartnell's tenure; instead, any historical tales also included a science fiction element. Patrick Troughton retained the role until the last episode of The War Games when members of the Doctor's race, the Time Lords, <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> trial for breaking the laws of time and forced him to regenerate.|$|E
5|$|The duel {{took place}} in Indiana on January 19, 1809, just across the Ohio River from Shippingport, Kentucky. Joseph Hamilton Daveiss {{provided}} the pistols. On the first shot, Marshall missed and Clay lightly grazed Marshall's stomach. Marshall missed again on the second shot, and Clay's pistol misfired. Marshall's third shot lightly wounded Clay in the thigh, while Clay missed Marshall entirely. Clay insisted that the two each take another shot, but Marshall declined on grounds that Clay's injury <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> unequal footing with his adversary, and the matter was ended.|$|E
5|$|Entering the season, Boudreau had amassed 189 wins in 309 NHL games. The win total <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> {{track to}} surpass Don Cherry as the fastest head coach to reach 200 NHL victories. After {{reaching}} 199 wins, Washington {{went on a}} four-game losing streak before finally earning Boudreau the milestone win. Despite the losing streak, Boudreau registered his 200th win in 326 games, eclipsing Cherry's previous mark of 341 games. While Boudreau set the record, he {{had the advantage of}} overtime and shootout victories, which did not exist during Cherry's coaching career. Boudreau was fired seven days after setting the record.|$|E

5|$|He had his {{breakout}} {{game for}} the New Zealand club in the round 18 48-0 victory over the Parramatta Eels. Tomkins scored two tries, {{one of which was}} directly from the lock position after a scrum win against the feed. The other of which, also from a scrum play, was down the short side where he broke four tackles in a fantastic individual effort. He also set up a brilliant try for captain Simon Mannering. In the first half, Tomkins recorded nine tackle breaks, a try assist, two line breaks, 84 running metres and two tries. His first half performance truly <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the map in the National Rugby League after some debate previous to this game over whether he was worth the big money.|$|E
5|$|However, {{when the}} king's uncle, Odo of Bayeux, raised a {{rebellion}} against the king in 1088, St-Calais was implicated in the revolt. William Rufus laid siege to St-Calais in the bishop's stronghold of Durham, and later <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> trial for treason. A contemporary record of this trial, the De Iniusta Vexacione Willelmi Episcopi Primi, is the earliest surviving detailed contemporary report of an English state-trial. Imprisoned briefly, St-Calais was allowed to go into exile after his castle at Durham was surrendered to the king. He went to Normandy, where he became a leading advisor to Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, the elder brother of William Rufus. By 1091, St-Calais had returned to England and regained royal favour.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Lemon was {{the oldest}} Indian on the roster at age 37. Lemon pitched 3.1 innings over the span of two games before he {{was put on the}} Indians' {{disabled}} list and sent to the Triple-A San Diego Padres. There he continued physical conditioning and mentored the pitching staff of the Indians' top farm club. He appeared in 12 games with the Padres, going 2–5, with a 4.34 ERA, 22 walks, and 19 strikeouts. He returned to pitch for the Indians on May 25 in a relief role, but he appeared in only nine games that season. He earned just one decision that year, a loss, which brought his career pitching record to 207–128. The club <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> waivers in July.|$|E

5|$|In Globe, Arizona, Burnham unwittingly {{joined the}} losing side of the Pleasant Valley War before mass killing started, and only {{narrowly}} escaped death. He had no stake in the feud, but he was drawn into the conflict by his association with the Gordon family. Once the killing started, {{he felt he had}} to join a faction as a hired gun, although it <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> {{the wrong side of the}} law. In between raids and forays, he practiced incessantly with his pistol; he learned to shoot using either hand and from the back of a galloping horse. Even after his faction admitted defeat (the feud would begin again years later), Burnham still had many enemies.|$|E
5|$|Orr {{has been}} known to be {{fiercely}} loyal to former Bruin personnel and teammates. When Derek Sanderson had alcohol and prescription drug-abuse problems and wound up penniless, Orr spent his own money to ensure that Sanderson successfully completed rehab. Decades later, Orr and Sanderson went into business together managing finances for hockey players. Orr also helped out Bruins trainer John (Frosty) Forristall, his roommate during his first years with the Bruins, who had just been fired from the Tampa Bay Lightning for alcoholism in 1994. Forristall's drinking <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> bad terms with his brother John, so he returned to Boston jobless and soon afterwards was diagnosed with brain cancer. Orr took Forristall into his home for a year until he {{died at the age of}} 51. Orr was a pallbearer at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} rounds were played Thursday and the final two rounds on Friday. Strong's fine results in the {{first two rounds}} <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> 149, tied for second place with Ray, two strokes behind the second round leader, Vardon, who stood at 147. Strong's play was {{remarkable}} for its steadiness, rather than any particular brilliancy, as he methodically hit fairways and greens and seldom found himself in trouble. Strong beat or tied eventual winner Francis Ouimet in rounds 1, 2 and 4. A disappointing third round 82, however, ruined any chance he had to win the tournament and he would eventually finish on 310, +18 to par, for a ninth-place finish. He won $40 as his share of the purse.|$|E

5|$|The no-hitter {{cemented}} Holloman's spot in {{the starting}} rotation for the next month. In his next start against the Athletics, he lasted barely an inning, allowing two runs and three walks before leaving the game due to a blistered finger. His next win came on May 28 against the Cleveland Indians, but his third win did not come until a month later against the Boston Red Sox, where he allowed two hits in eight innings of work. Outside of the three wins, however, Holloman was ineffective; in 22 games, 10 of them starts, Holloman had a 3–7 record with a 5.23 ERA, 25 strikeouts, and 50 walks. As a result, after his final appearance on July 19, the Browns <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> waivers, and he was sold to the Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|E
5|$|Wall {{immediately}} began {{working in the}} video game industry, composing the soundtrack to Vigilance. Primarily composing in an orchestral style, by 2001 he composed the soundtrack to , which was the title he says <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the map as a video game composer. In 2002, Wall became one of around 20 co-founders of the Game Audio Network Guild (G.A.N.G.) as well as senior director. In 2005, Wall, along with G.A.N.G. founder and fellow composer Tommy Tallarico, produced the Video Games Live concert series, having served as the conductor for the international concert tour. His latest released soundtrack is that of 2012 Black Ops 2. His soundtracks for Myst III: Exile, , Rise of the Kasai, Jade Empire, Mass Effect, and Mass Effect 2 were nominated for and won multiple awards.|$|E
5|$|Benchley re-entered Hollywood at {{the height}} of the Great Depression and the {{large-scale}} introduction of the talkie films he had begun working with years before. His arrival <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the scene of a number of productions almost instantly. While Benchley was more interested in writing than acting, one of his more important roles as an actor was as a salesman in Rafter Romance, and his work attracted the interest of MGM, who offered Benchley a lot of money to complete a series of short films. Benchley, who had also been offered a syndicated column by Hearst, was able to film the shorts in New York and keep up with his new column. Before heading back to New York, Benchley took a role in the feature film Dancing Lady (1933), which also featured Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Fred Astaire, Nelson Eddy, and the Three Stooges.|$|E

5|$|His {{introduction}} to films was unusual. When visiting an aunt {{who lived in}} Brooklyn opposite Vitagraph Studios, Cagney would climb over the fence to watch the filming of John Bunny movies. He became involved in amateur dramatics, starting as a scenery boy for a Chinese pantomime at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, {{one of the first}} settlement houses in the nation, where his brother Harry performed and his soon-to-be friend, Florence James, directed. He was initially content working behind the scenes and had no interest in performing. One night, however, Harry became ill, and although Cagney was not an understudy, his photographic memory of rehearsals enabled him to stand in for his brother without making a single mistake. Therefore, Florence James has the unique distinction of being the first director to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> a stage. Afterward, he joined a number of companies as a performer in a variety of roles.|$|E
5|$|Graf's {{unit was}} interned {{for over a}} week with more than 30,000 other {{disarmed}} soldiers in a primitive camp with minimal food and sanitation. Following {{the letter of the}} Allied agreement, units fighting on the Eastern Front were to become Soviet prisoners. Graf and most of the JG52 personnel were handed over by the American forces to the Soviet Union on 15 May 1945. On 20 August, he and other senior Luftwaffe officers, including Hartmann and Hans Hahn, were moved to POW Camp No. 150 in Gryazovets, northeast of Moscow. This was a (relatively) more comfortable confinement than the regular labour camps and intended to provide a more sympathetic environment for high-profile prisoners. When Graf was found not to be malleable for their purposes, the Soviet regime <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> trial for war-crimes. However, when insufficient evidence could be produced, the charges were dropped. Erich Hartmann however, was found guilty and sentenced to 25 years of forced labour. On 8 December 1945, Graf was moved to POW Camp No. 27 in Krasnogorsk, Moscow. The author, Musciano, mentions that he was subject to solitary confinement for extended periods, but that he had his final order hidden in his shoe and would re-read it to keep his sanity.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton's prowess as {{a runner}} and passer thrilled the Georgia Tech fans. Offensive {{coordinator}} Ralph Friedgen utilized a complex offense with Hamilton that featured option football {{mixed in with}} complex timing routes. Hamilton racked up yardage, touchdowns, and wins for Tech. In 1998, Hamilton and Tech's high powered offense won 10 games and a season ending victory over Notre Dame in the Gator Bowl. Hamilton's senior year <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the national stage. He was a leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy against rushing phenomenon Ron Dayne. Hamilton passed for over 3000 yards and rushed for over 700 yards. But while Hamilton dazzled, the Georgia Tech defense was a liability (they allowed around 28 points per game), and may have ultimately cost Hamilton the 1999 Heisman Trophy. In a late-season, nationally televised game against Wake Forest, Tech gave up 26 points and Hamilton threw two interceptions and no touchdowns. As an indirect result, Dayne {{went on to win}} the Heisman (Joe was runner-up). Hamilton's Georgia Tech career ended on a sour note in the 2000 Gator Bowl against the Miami, where the Jackets lost 28–13. The following season, redshirt junior George Godsey, a more traditional pocket passer, succeeded Hamilton at the helm of Tech's powerful offense. The drop-off was minimal—Godsey continued where Hamilton left off, winning 9 games in 2000 and 8 games in 2001. In 2000, Godsey also led Tech to their third straight victory over the archival Georgia Bulldogs.|$|E
