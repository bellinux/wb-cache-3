40|$|Natural {{products}} {{have been an}} invaluable source of inspiration for medicinal and organic chemists and this field is constantly expanding and evolving to explore more and more aspects of where these products come from, what they do, {{and how they can}} be improved upon. The Burkart lab has taken a well-rounded approach to natural product chemistry in which many aspects of natural product synthesis and biosynthesis are examined. Our group is very much interested in the biosynthesis of fatty acid, polyketide, and NRPS natural products. Regardless the pathway, all three utilize a carrier protein (ACP for fatty acid and polyketide, PCP for NRPS) which forms a thioester with the biosynthetic intermediate and shuttles this intermediates between enzymes. The thiol arm that extends out from the carrier proteins originates from 4 '- <b>phosphopantotheine.</b> The molecule coenzyme A is transferred onto the carrier protein by phosphopantothenoyl transferase enzyme. Chapter 1 of this dissertation describes the total synthesis of CJ- 15, 801 {{as well as a number}} of analogs and characterizes the way in which is disrupts the biosynthesis of coenzyme A in Staphylococcus aureus. The following chapters focus on a class of polyketide natural products, the spirohexenolides. While our group was examining a strain of Streptomyces for new natural products we discovered the spirohexenolides. Their isolation and structure elucidation as well as initial bioactivity studies are described in Chapter 2. Knowing that this class of molecules are bioactive though not knowing their target, we fluorescently tagged spirohexenolide A and used this probe to pull down its molecular target, identifying it as human macrophage migration inhibitory factor. This work is described in chapter 3. To further explore the role the spirohexenolides play in modulating hMIF activity we looked toward analog development. To do this, a synthetic route to the spirohexenolides would need to be accessed. Chapter 4 describes the ongoing efforts towards finalizing our synthetic rout...|$|E
