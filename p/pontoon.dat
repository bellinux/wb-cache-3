5|$|<b>Pontoon</b> bridge: The Zhou Dynasty Chinese {{text of the}} Shi Jing (Book of Odes) {{records that}} King Wen of Zhou {{was the first to}} create a <b>pontoon</b> bridge in the 11th century BC. However, the British scientist, sinologist and {{historian}} Joseph Needham has pointed out that in all likely scenarios, the temporary <b>pontoon</b> bridge was invented during the 9th or 8th century BC in China, as this part was perhaps a later addition to the book (considering how the book had been edited up until the Han Dynasty, 202 BC220 AD). Although earlier temporary <b>pontoon</b> bridges had been made in China, the first secure and permanent ones (and linked with iron chains) in China came first during the Qin Dynasty (221 BC207 BC). The later Song Dynasty (9601279 AD) Chinese statesman Cao Cheng once wrote a description of the early <b>pontoon</b> bridges in China. During the Eastern Han Dynasty (25220 AD), the Chinese created a very large <b>pontoon</b> bridge that spanned across the width of the Yellow River. There was also the rebellion of Gongsun Shu in 33 AD, where a large <b>pontoon</b> bridge with fortified posts was constructed across the Yangtze River, eventually broken through with ramming ships by official Han troops under Commander Cen Peng. During the late Eastern Han into the Three Kingdoms period, during the Battle of Chibi in 208 AD, the Prime Minister Cao Cao once linked the majority of his fleet together with iron chains, which proved to be a fatal mistake once he was thwarted with a fire attack by Sun Quan's fleet. The armies of Emperor Taizu of Song had a large <b>pontoon</b> bridge built across the Yangtze River in 974 in order to secure supply lines during the Song Dynasty's conquest of the Southern Tang.|$|E
5|$|A brief famine {{of unknown}} extent occurred, perhaps caused by this {{financial}} crisis, but Suetonius claims it resulted from Caligula's seizure of public carriages; according to Seneca, grain imports were disturbed because Caligula repurposed grain boats for a <b>pontoon</b> bridge.|$|E
5|$|An {{incident}} in Žirmūnai's history {{that has been}} difficult to reconstruct occurred in 1975, when a <b>pontoon</b> bridge across the River Neris, that was customarily set up from spring to autumn, collapsed due to the weight of a crowd returning from a concert in the Palace of Concerts and Sports. It was rumoured that the bridge supports were not fully connected at the time. There were witnessed fatalities involving drownings and crushing by the bridge structures. Public discussion of the disaster was restricted and the number of casualties remains unknown. The <b>pontoon</b> bridge was never re-erected at the site; the Mindaugas Bridge now serves this need.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{began on}} the new east-half {{floating}} <b>pontoons</b> at Concrete Technology in April 2006. Fourteen <b>pontoons</b> will be built in four cycles at the site. Completed <b>pontoons</b> will be floated out of the graving dock in Tacoma and transported to Seattle for outfitting at Todd Shipyards. Outfitting includes adding all electrical and mechanical parts, connecting the <b>pontoons</b> into sections and building the roadway {{on top of the}} <b>pontoons.</b> Another three <b>pontoons,</b> built during the west-half bridge replacement in the early 1980s, will be retrofitted in Seattle.|$|R
5000|$|Of the <b>pontoons,</b> 21 are {{longitudinal}} <b>pontoons</b> {{that support}} the deck and structure and are 360 x 75 x 28 ft and weight 11,000 ST; 54 smaller supplemental <b>pontoons,</b> weighing 2,500 ST, are used to stabilized {{the weight of the}} bridge; and two [...] "cross" [...] <b>pontoons,</b> weighing 10,100 ST, are sited {{at each end of the}} floating span at transitional spans, which connect the deck to fixed bridges and approaches using hinges to move up to 24 in for fluctuations in lake water levels moving the <b>pontoons.</b> All the <b>pontoons</b> are designed with watertight compartments that are monitored remotely with sensors to detect leaks that could lead to catastrophic failure.|$|R

5|$|At 5:30AM on 21 March, the Israeli forces {{attacked}} simultaneously on {{the three}} bridges. Combat engineers built a <b>pontoon</b> bridge {{in the north and}} the troops crossed the river. The Israeli spearheads pushed across the Allenby Bridge and advanced towards Shunat Nimreen.|$|E
5|$|Before 1897, {{there had}} been a ferry at Grovehill, and a {{shipyard}} on the east bank, owned by Joseph Scarr. To assist his workers to reach the shipyard, Scarr designed and built a ferry bridge, which cost him £300. It consisted of a large rectangular <b>pontoon,</b> above which was fitted a bridge deck with handrails. Two jack screws enabled the deck to be raised or lowered in relation to the <b>pontoon,</b> so that it remained at approximately the same height, whatever the state of the tide. On the eastern bank, Scarr constructed a variable-height landing, but the landing on the west bank was constructed by Beverley Council, and was fixed. Scarr campaigned to have a variable landing here as well, and was prepared to fund it, but his requests were always rejected. The fixed landing made access to the bridge difficult at high tides. When a boat needed to pass, the west end was freed, and the <b>pontoon</b> swung round to lie parallel to the bank, either upstream or downstream, depending {{on the state of the}} tide. It would then be winched back into position by a small barrel winch. At night the bridge was closed and moored beside the bank.|$|E
5|$|From Han {{literary}} sources, it {{is known}} that wooden-trestle beam bridges, arch bridges, simple suspension bridges, and floating <b>pontoon</b> bridges existed in Han China. However, there are only two known references to arch bridges in Han literature, and only a single Han relief sculpture in Sichuan depicts an arch bridge.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, {{discussion}} {{started with}} the plans to connect Meland, Flatøy and Lindøy with bridges. This {{was passed by the}} Parliament of Norway in May 1975, and consisted of the Krossnessundet Bridge between Flatøy and Meland, which opened in November 1978. The Hagelsund Bridge opened on 1 April 1982 and connected Flatøy to Lindås and Knarvik, thus also connecting Meland and Lindås. Both bridges were partially financed with tolls. The plans for a <b>pontoon</b> bridge were presented to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications on 31 March 1981. They supported the choice of a <b>pontoon</b> bridge. The decision to construct the bridge was taken by parliament on 9 December 1987, but they demanded that a larger ship channel be constructed.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the growth}} of Portishead's {{population}} {{can be attributed to the}} development of the former docks into a vibrant community. The former deep-water dock, used to supply coal and goods to the power stations, has been fully redeveloped into a modern marina with 250 <b>pontoon</b> berths.|$|E
5|$|Other {{examples}} of Song bridges include Guyue Bridge, a stone arch bridge in Yiwu, Zhejiang Province. The bridge {{was built in}} 1213, the sixth year of the Jiading Era in the Southern Song dynasty. Song-era <b>pontoon</b> bridges include the Dongjin Bridge, 400m (mi) long, which may still be seen today.|$|E

50|$|Semi-submersible marine {{structures}} are typically only movable by towing. Semi-submersible platforms have the principal characteristic of remaining in a substantially stable position, presenting small movements when they experience environmental forces {{such as the}} wind, waves and currents. Semi-Submersible platforms have <b>pontoons</b> and columns, typically two parallel spaced apart <b>pontoons</b> with buoyant columns upstanding from those <b>pontoons</b> to support a deck. Some of the semi-submersible vessels only have a single caisson, or column, usually denoted as a buoy while others utilize three or more columns extended upwardly from buoyant <b>pontoons.</b> For activities which require a stable offshore platform, the vessel is then ballasted down so that the <b>pontoons</b> are submerged, and only the buoyant columns pierce the water surface - thus giving the vessel a substantial buoyancy with a small water-plane area. The only concrete semi-submersible in existence is Troll B.|$|R
5|$|A marina {{was started}} in 1979 by {{dredging}} the upper harbour and laying <b>pontoons.</b> Light industry and car parks occupy the adjacent land. More <b>pontoons</b> were completed in 1991 and 1995. The Whitby Marina Facilities Centre was opened in June 2010.|$|R
5|$|The Coastal Administration {{stated that}} they would not allow a <b>pontoon</b> bridge. SBT decided on 26 June 1987 to work towards {{receiving}} permission to collect advanced tolls on the ferry services. On 16 September, they unanimously supported the triangular proposal, which was estimated to cost NOK660 million. This was criticized by Hordaland Public Roads Administration, who stated that it would take longer time to plan—and thus complete—the Triangle Link. A poll from January 1988 showed that 78.6 {{percent of the population of}} Bømlo wanted the Triangle Link, while 8.6 percent wanted the <b>pontoon</b> bridge. On 6 January, SBT started negotiating loans with various banks to receive financial guarantees for the Triangle Link, and by February sufficient funding had been secured.|$|E
5|$|The Third Army began {{crossing}} the Rhine River after constructing a <b>pontoon</b> bridge on March 22, and he slipped a division {{across the river}} that evening. Patton later boasted he had urinated into the river as he crossed.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} {{for construction of}} the <b>pontoon</b> bridge was awarded in August 1991 to a consortium, Arbeidsfellesskapet Salhus Bru, which consisted of Norwegian Contractors, Aker Entreprenør, Veidekke and Kværner Eureka. The components were built in Moss and Fredrikstad and then shipped to Lonevågen, a branch of Osterfjorden which was suitable to connect the parts. There were problems welding the high-strength low-alloy steel, {{which resulted in the}} work being halted for several days before an agreement was reached between the contractor and the Public Roads Administration. On 26 January 1994, the steel frame which would be used to fasten the <b>pontoon</b> bridge to the cable-stayed bridge, came adrift during transport in Skagerrak, and was severely damaged, causing a delay in the project. As the bridge had the longest laterally unsupported span in the world, the construction was watched by many international delegations.|$|E
5000|$|Floating bridges were {{historically}} constructed using wood. <b>Pontoons</b> {{were formed}} by simply lashing several barrels together, by rafts of timbers, or by using boats. Each bridge section consisted {{of one or}} more <b>pontoons,</b> which were maneuvered into position and then anchored underwater or on land. The <b>pontoons</b> were linked together using wooden stringers called balks. The balks were covered by a series of cross planks called chesses to form the road surface, and the chesses were secured with side guard rails.|$|R

5|$|UN bombers {{immediately}} {{targeted the}} <b>pontoon</b> {{bridge across the}} Han River at Seoul which was a main line of supply to the Pusan battlefield, and to destroy the repaired railroad bridge there. Several attempts in July by B-29s to destroy the rail bridge failed, but on July 29, 12 bombers succeeded in hitting the <b>pontoon</b> bridge and reported it as having been destroyed. The next day, 47 B-29s bombed the Chosen Nitrogen Plant at Hungnam on the northeast coast. In the meantime, carrier-based planes from the USS Valley Forge, which was operating in the Yellow Sea, destroyed six locomotives, exploded 18 cars of a 33-car train, and damaged a combination highway and rail bridge at Haeju on July 22.|$|E
5|$|A new route was {{launched}} by Bømlo Mayor Malvin Meling, who proposed a <b>pontoon</b> bridge which would cross Stokksundet. He {{was inspired by}} the plans to build what would become the Nordhordland Bridge north of Bergen. In 1973, the municipal councils of Bømlo, Stord and Fitjar decided to launch a planning process, which concluded that a <b>pontoon</b> bridge between Sørstokken and Foldrøyholmen would be optimal. The report also considered bridges across the Fitjar Archipelago and a crossing via Spissøy and Føyno. There were protests from Wichmann Motorfabrikk who were concerned about their operations if the sound was closed for shipping traffic. Similar protests also came from the shipping industry, who wished to continue using Stokksundet; the protests were not remedied by the plans including a suspension bridge across Foldrøysundet. To illustrate their point, one shipowner let two of his ships cross in the middle of Foldrøysundet. The shipping industry received support from Norwegian Coastal Administration and the plans were abandoned in 1974.|$|E
5|$|By 01:00 on 14 May, a <b>pontoon</b> bridge {{had been}} erected over which {{elements}} of the 1st Panzer Division began crossing the Meuse into the bridgeheads. General Marcel Têtu, commander of the Allied Tactical Air Forces ordered an air strike against the <b>pontoon</b> bridge. Between 15:00 and 16:00 Allied bombers and fighters attacked the bridge. During this attack, Strachwitz organized the traffic across the bridge and ensured delivery of the anti-aircraft ammunition to help fend off the aerial attack, which inflicted only minor damage and did not stop the German advance. Panzer-Pionierbataillon 37 and Sturm-Pionierbataillon 43 ran into enemy tanks at Chéhéry and Panzer-Brigade I into French tanks at Bulson. More than 70 French tanks were left destroyed on the battlefield. While Kirchner ordered the bulk of 1st Panzer Division to keep heading west, French General Charles Huntziger ordered elements of his IIe Armée to protect the heights of Stonne, south of Sedan. This dissipated his forces and the French resistance was broken near Vendresse.|$|E
50|$|The {{inflatable}} <b>pontoons</b> {{were later}} replaced by rigid <b>pontoons,</b> while the fuselage was lengthened and the starting engines added. This incarnation {{was given the}} designation 14M1P. However, the bureau supplying the intended battery of 12 RD-36-35PR lift engines did not deliver, and this made VTOL testing impossible.|$|R
50|$|In the Italian {{version in}} 2016, one {{variation}} is that fire hoses were {{played on the}} competitors {{as they try to}} cross the <b>pontoons,</b> and another variation involves them having to jump into the pool fully clothed and swim past the <b>pontoons</b> using inflatable rubber sharks as buoyancy aids.|$|R
50|$|The wagons {{were pushed}} by a {{locomotive}} down a ramp with slope {{of one in}} 48 to the <b>pontoons</b> and were pulled {{up on the other}} side by another locomotive. The <b>pontoons</b> would carry either six freight wagons or five carriages. Passengers stayed in their carriages during the trip.|$|R
5|$|Bømlo Municipal Council voted {{unanimously}} {{in favor of}} the Triangle Link on 22 February 1988. Two days later, the issue was discussed in Stord Municipal Council. Olav Akselsen at first proposed supporting the <b>pontoon</b> bridge, but after a trial vote he withdrew the proposal and also Stord supported the Triangle Link. The following week, Sveio Municipal Council voted in favor the Triangle Link, without either a debate or dissent in the council. Fitjar Municipal Council voted on 15 March to work with both proposals. Hordaland Public Roads Administration still supported a <b>pontoon</b> bridge, and stated that {{two and a half years}} of work on a master plan had been wasted. A new master plan for the Triangle Link was published in early 1989, estimating the costs at NOK890 million. It recommended that the Langevåg–Buavåg Ferry remain, but the other four ferry services be terminated. The report concluded that the maintenance costs of the fixed link would be lower than the subsidies of the ferry, that the project would be economical of society and would reduce emissions.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{planning}} {{started in}} March 1990, {{and at first}} two technical methods for constructing the <b>pontoon</b> bridge were considered: a continuous concrete floating caisson between the abutments, and a steel version incorporating a truss bridge carrying concrete pontoons. However, they were both rejected {{in favor of a}} concrete or steel box section borne on concrete pontoons.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, {{the issue}} was brought up again, this time as a <b>pontoon</b> bridge. The depth and {{steepness}} of the fjord would {{make it impossible to}} fasten the bridge to the sea bottom. However, a method without lateral anchorage had been developed for the Hobart Bridge in Australia. Another alternative was launched in 1963, involving a submerged floating tunnel through the fjord. It was estimated to cost between NOK 19.5 and 26 million. Norwegian expatriate Leif J. Sverdrup, co-founder of Sverdrup & Parcel of the United States, inspected the fjord in 1965 and was later hired to plan the bridge in cooperation with Oslo-based civil engineering consultants Prosjektering. Municipal engineers started measuring currents in 1966. Prosjektering and Sverdrup & Parcel recommended a <b>pontoon</b> bridge with a movable section to allow passage of ship traffic. In 1967, a new proposal was launched, in which a seaway tunnel would be blasted out in the rock on the Bergen side.|$|E
50|$|The hull {{consists}} of two <b>pontoons</b> with four columns each. Transit draught is about 12 metres. For lifting operations it will normally be ballasted down to 26.6 m. This way the <b>pontoons</b> (with a draught of 13.6 metres) are well submerged to reduce the effect of waves and swell.|$|R

Foraging by {{predatory fish}} {{is thought to}} be one of the primary {{ecological}} processes affecting the abundances of plants and animals in subtidal habitats. The importance of this process was assessed on the subtidal surfaces of urban structures (<b>pontoons</b> and pilings) that represent major coastal habitats for marine organisms. Fish feed with greater intensity on epibiota attached to pilings than <b>pontoons</b> and it was hypothesised that greater predation on pilings explained why the structure of epibiotic assemblages differs between these habitats. I predicted that the structure of epibiotic assemblages would develop differently between pilings and <b>pontoons</b> in the presence of fish (plates open to predation) but not in the absence of fish (plates inside exclusion cages). Results revealed large differences in abundance between pilings and <b>pontoons</b> that were largely independent of the caged and uncaged plates. Predation may be intense (as it appeared on pilings) but unimportant because it does not explain observed abundances of prey (epibiota between pilings and <b>pontoons).</b> S. D. Connell[URL]...|$|R
