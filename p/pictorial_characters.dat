But {{there is}} one {{character}} of Byzantine work which, according to the time at which it was employed, may be considered as either fitting or unfitting it for distinctly ecclesiastical purposes; I mean the essentially <b>pictorial</b> <b>character</b> of its decoration. We have already seen what large surfaces it leaves void of bold architectural features, to be rendered interesting merely by surface ornament or sculpture. In this respect Byzantine work differs essentially from pure Gothic styles, which are capable of filling every vacant space by features purely architectural, and may be rendered, if we please, altogether independent of pictorial aid. A Gothic church may be rendered impressive by mere successions of arches, accumulations of niches, and entanglements of tracery. But a Byzantine church requires expression and interesting decoration over vast plane surfaces,--decoration which becomes noble only by becoming pictorial; that is to say, by representing natural objects,--men, animals, or flowers. And, therefore, the question whether the Byzantine style be fit for church service in modern days, becomes involved in the inquiry, what effect upon religion has been or may yet be produced by pictorial art, and especially by {{the art of the}} mosaicist? ...|$|R

His exhibition at l'Effort Moderne at the outset of 1921 was exclusively of landscapes: his formal vocabulary remained rhythmic, linear perspective was avoided. There was a motivation to unite the pictorial and the natural. Christopher Green writes: [...] "The willingness to adapt Cubist language to the look of nature was quickly to affect his figure painting too. From that exhibition of 1921 Metzinger continued to cultivate a style that was not only less obscure, but clearly took subject-matter as its starting point far more than an abstract play with flat pictorial elements." [...] Green continues: Yet, style, in the sense of his own special way of handling form and color, remained for Metzinger the determining factor, something imposed on his subjects to give them their special <b>pictorial</b> <b>character.</b> His sweet, rich colour between 1921 and 1924 was unashamedly artificial, and is itself symptomatic of the fact that his return to lucid representation did not mean a return to nature approached naturalistically... Metzinger himself, writing in 1922 [...] could claim quite confidently that this was not at all a betrayal of Cubism but a development within it. 'I know works,' he said, 'whose thoroughly classical appearance conveys the most personal [...] the newest conceptions... Now that certain Cubists have pushed their constructions so far as to take in clearly objective appearances, it has been declared that Cubism is dead [...] it approaches realization.' ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationships between chance and visual culture during the Northern Renaissance, focusing {{on the use of}} images in the deliberate, ritualized application of chance in games and divination. I argue that, prior to the development of probability theory in the seventeenth century, images served a critical function in encountering and negotiating uncertainties about the future. The casting of lots for prognostication and play was nothing new in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Yet, aided in part by the growing print industry, the period witnessed the development of new and varied forms for these practices, forms that were increasingly <b>pictorial</b> in <b>character.</b> A series of case studies examines the popular media of chance, such as playing cards, game boards, and divinatory devices. In addition, I connect these objects to works by major artists of the period in order to assert the importance of chance for the development of early modern artistic production. Just as images helped stage a confrontation with future contingency in play and divination, artists also began to experiment with the construction of time and narrative in pictorial representation. In Northern Europe in particular, the rise of visual media for chance coincides with the emergence of artistic subjects that were not bound to pre-established or predictable narratives and, significantly, often incorporated references to games of chance and fortune's mutability. Taken together, these phenomena not only point to the importance of chance and futurity in the development of early modern art and visuality, they also suggest crucial but neglected epistemological, social, and aesthetic aspects of image-making and use. These aspects have remained largely unexamined due to the traditional view of the Renaissance as a period defined by its relationship to the past of classical antiquity. This project thus seeks to recast our understanding of Renaissance temporality by pointing to the future as a key impetus within the visual culture of the period...|$|R
40|$|During the Romantic Era, the {{character}} piece flourished {{and became one}} of the most important genres. Even though character pieces existed as early as the eighteenth century, it was not until the nineteenth century that Romantic Era literary figures discovered that music was as powerful as any other artistic medium in expressing unspeakable emotions. The character piece allowed composers to express a definite mood, a programmatic idea, or a <b>pictorial</b> association. <b>Character</b> pieces often have titles that suggest briehess or casualness, such as a Beethoven Bagatelle, a Schubert Impromptu or Moment musicaux. Others have expressive programmatic titles, such as Schumann's Kreisleriana and Liszt's Apres une lecture de Dante. Ths dissertation was based on selected works from the nineteenth century and early-twentieth century in order to demonstrate the great variety of musical thought and stylistic development. I have examined composers from different countries and of different nationalities to establish what and how they contributed to the remarkable diversity in this genre. The selected works allowed for very personal programs. These concerts, in addition to being good combinations of pieces, are representative of the genre. The first program consisted of Chopin's Preludes, Op. 28; three pieces from Debussy 7 s Images Books I and 11; and Liszt 7 s Apres une lecture de Dante. The second program included seven of Beethoven's Bagatelles, Op. 33; Schumann's Kinderscenen, Op. 15; Poulenc's Mouvements perpetuels and Intermezzo in A-jlat Major; Faure 7 s Nocturne in B Major, Op. 33, No. 2 and Impromptu No. 2 in F Minor; three of Mompou's Canciones y Danzas; four of Villa-Lobos Prole do bebe Suite No. 1; and Albkniz's Navarra. The third and final program comprised four selections from Rachrnaninoff s Moment musicaux, Op. 16; five pieces from Grieg's Lyric Pieces; and Arensky 7 s Suite No. 1 for Two Pianos and Suite No. 2 for Two Pianos. I wanted to bring out nuances specific to the individual composers and show how their character pieces helped in shaping the Romantic Era. Even in the twenty-first century, an era of highly specialized musical tastes, the popularity and accessibility of character pieces stand out...|$|R

Just as a speaker of sign language punctuates her narrative with signs {{that are at}} once pictures and words, O'Connor punctuates the narratives of her novels with moments or pauses in the forward motion of her text that are somehow framed [...] in a mirror, or in a window, for example [...] and that also are at once pictures and words.

Examination of the chronological development and refinement of Flannery O'Connor's pictorial technique by considering the meaning conveyed by the arrangement of figures in a single panel cartoon, the contextual significance found in literary tableaux and filmic montage, the use of the pictorial "camera eye," and the imprinting of tattoo on the human body, presents a new perspective in interpreting her work.

40|$|The {{popularity}} of digital image and video is increasing rapidly. To help users navigate libraries of image and video, Content Based Information Retrieval (CBIR) {{system that can}} automatically index image and video documents are needed. However, due to the semantic gap between low-level machine descriptors and high-level semantic descriptors, the existing CBIR systems are still far from perfect. Text embedded in multi-media data, as a well-defined model of concepts for humans 2 ̆ 7 communication, contains much semantic information related to the content. This text information can provide a much truer form of content-based access to the image and video documents {{if it can be}} extracted and harnessed efficiently. This dissertation solves the problem involved in detecting text object in image and video and tracking text event in video. For text detection problem, we propose a new unsupervised text detection algorithm. A new text model is constructed to describe text object using <b>pictorial</b> structure. Each <b>character</b> is a part in the model and every two neighboring characters are connected by a spring-like link. Two characters and the link connecting them are defined as a text unit. We localize candidate parts by extracting closed boundaries and initialize the links by connecting two neighboring candidate parts based on the spatial relationship of characters. For every candidate part, we compute character energy using three new character features, averaged angle difference of corresponding pairs, fraction of non-noise pairs, and vector of stroke width. They are extracted based on our observation that the edge of a character can be divided into two sets with high similarities in length, curvature, and orientation. For every candidate link, we compute link energy based on our observation that the characters of a text typically align along certain direction with similar color, size, and stroke width. For every candidate text unit, we combine character and link energies to compute text unit energy which indicates the probability that the candidate text model is a real text object. The final text detection results are generated using a text unit energy based thresholding. For text tracking problem, we construct a text event model by using pictorial structure as well. In this model, the detected text object in each video frame is a part and two neighboring text objects of a text event are connected by a spring-like link. Inter-frame link energy is computed for each link based on the character energy, similarity of neighboring text objects, and motion information. After refining the model using inter-frame link energy, the remaining text event models are marked as text events. At character level, because the proposed method {{is based on the assumption}} that the strokes of a character have uniform thickness, it can detect and localize characters from different languages in different styles, such as typewritten text or handwriting text, if the characters have approximately uniform stroke thickness. At text level, however, because the spatial relationship between two neighboring characters is used to localize text objects, the proposed method may fail to detect and localize the characters with multiple separate strokes or connected characters. For example, some East Asian language characters, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, have many strokes of a single character. We need to group the strokes first to form single characters and then group characters to form text objects. While, the characters of some languages, such Arabic and Hindi, are connected together, we cannot extract spatial information between neighboring characters since they are detected as a single character. Therefore, in current stage the proposed method can detect and localize the text objects that are composed of separate characters with connected strokes with approximately uniform thickness. We evaluated our method comprehensively using three English language-based image and video datasets: ICDAR 2003 / 2005 text locating dataset (258 training images and 251 test images), Microsoft Street View text detection dataset (307 street view images), and VACE video dataset (50 broadcast news videos from CNN and ABC). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed text detection method can capture the inherent properties of text and discriminate text from other objects efficiently...|$|R
