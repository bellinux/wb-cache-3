5|$|Fermi had {{the idea}} to resort to {{replacing}} the polonium-beryllium neutron source with a radon-beryllium one, which he created by filling a glass bulb with beryllium powder, evacuating the air, and then adding 50 mCi of radon gas, supplied by Giulio Cesare Trabacchi. This created a much stronger neutron source, the effectiveness of which declined with the 3.8-day half-life of radon. He knew that this source would also emit gamma rays, but, {{on the basis of}} his theory, he believed that this would not affect the results of the experiment. He started by bombarding platinum, an element with a high atomic number that was readily available, without success. He turned to aluminium, which emitted an alpha particle and produced sodium, which then decayed into magnesium by beta <b>particle</b> <b>emission.</b> He tried lead, without success, and then fluorine in the form of calcium fluoride, which emitted an alpha particle and produced nitrogen, decaying into oxygen by beta <b>particle</b> <b>emission.</b> In all, he induced radioactivity in 22 different elements. Fermi rapidly reported the discovery of neutron-induced radioactivity in the Italian journal La Ricerca Scientifica on 25 March 1934.|$|E

40|$|Since 1 st of January 2015 ships {{operating}} in sulphur emission control areas (SECAs) {{have to use}} marine fuels with a fuel sulphur content less than 0. 1 %m/m. This regulation forces the ship owners to make a fuel shift and use low-sulphur marine fuel oils, use alternative fuels or use scrubbers on-board their ships. One {{driving force behind the}} regulation of the fuel sulphur content was to reduce the emissions to air of harmful particles. This thesis focuses on the two first strategies and evaluate how fuel sulphur content and other fuel characteristics affect the <b>particle</b> <b>emissions.</b> This thesis presents results from particle measurements done in test-bed engine labs and on-board operating ships, with focus on number, mass and sizes of the emitted particles. The on-board measurements considered how a fuel shift from a heavy fuel oil to a low-sulphur residual marine fuel oil and how use of an alternative fuel, in this case liquefied natural gas (LNG) affect the <b>particle</b> <b>emissions.</b> In the test-bed engine measurements the <b>particle</b> <b>emissions</b> from different types of fuels and the effects of fuel sulphur content and other fuel characteristics, primarily the content of aromatics, were investigated. The results highlight that reduced fuel sulphur contents will not be the only solution for reducing <b>particle</b> <b>emissions,</b> and other fuel characteristics need to be considered. The fuel sulphur content influences the <b>emissions</b> of <b>particles</b> with a diameter of 50 nm or less, whereas other fuel characteristics affect particles in all sizes. An increased content of aromatics did not result in increasing <b>particle</b> <b>emissions,</b> which indicate that the content of aromatics may not play a crucial role with respect to <b>particle</b> <b>emissions</b> from ships. Furthermore, the fuel shift strategy and changing from heavy fuel oil to a low-sulphur residual marine fuel oil, did not affect the number of particles emitted significantly: similar amounts of number of particles were emitted and there was an increase in the <b>emissions</b> of smaller <b>particles.</b> In contrast, the strategy of using an alternative fuel, here LNG, resulted in significant reductions of the <b>particle</b> <b>emissions.</b> Furthermore, the results also highlight the importance of conducting measurements of number of particles emitted when studying <b>particle</b> <b>emissions</b> from ships and in any future regulation of these emissions...|$|R

Advisors: William Northrop, David Kittelson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 85 pages. <b>Particle</b> <b>emissions</b> from motor vehicles are an increasing source of atmospheric pollution. Operating conditions that produce significant <b>particle</b> number <b>emissions</b> in light duty vehicles were {{the focus of}} this study. Extremely cold conditions cause engines to use significant fuel enrichment during starting and warm-up and thus are prone to high <b>particle</b> <b>emissions.</b> In gasoline direct injection engines, this can lead to even higher soot formation due to liquid fuel impingement on the cold surfaces of the combustion chamber and piston. Humans can be exposed to high particle concentration from cold starting vehicles in parking ramps or any busy traffic areas due to higher vehicle density and poor ventilation. Separating ambient <b>particle</b> <b>emissions</b> according to engine type allows for the identification of vehicles that have the highest tailpipe emissions or contribute to high ambient particle number (PN) concentration. This thesis presents the results of two studies. The first study shows that the average PN emitted during 180 seconds by GDI and PFI vehicles after a cold-cold start were 3. 09 E+ 13 and 2. 12 E+ 13 particles respectively, based on tailpipe out <b>emissions.</b> The high <b>particle</b> <b>emissions</b> highlight the need for better particle control strategies to reduce <b>particle</b> <b>emissions</b> during engine startup in cold ambient temperatures. Meanwhile, the ambient study conducted at the exit of a parking ramp found that GDI vehicles (only 12 % of the vehicle population in this study) contributed to about 50 % of the increase of particle concentrations associated with vehicles.

40|$|Combustion {{of solid}} biomass under fixed bed {{conditions}} {{is a common}} technique to generate heat and power in both small and large scale grate furnaces (domestic boilers, stoves, district heating plants). From both an environmental and economical perspective, {{one of the most}} interesting alternatives to replace oil and electricity for heating of family houses and apartments in Sweden is wood pellets made of stem wood sawdust from pine and spruce. Unfortunately, combustion of biomass (also wood pellets) will produce <b>particle</b> <b>emissions</b> that may have a negative implication on the human health. The smallest (10 microns) are produced from residual fly ash particles (refractory metals) that have left the fuel bed and been carried by the gas upwards. The finest particles (10 microns). The mass concentration of the middle mode (~ 1 microns) are significantly lower then both the fine and the coarse mode. The particle concentration in the flue gas channel is affected by both operating and fuel parameters. The results showed that both the temperature and the flow pattern in the combustion zone affect the <b>particle</b> <b>emissions.</b> Increasing combustion temperature yields decreasing emissions of coarse fly ash (> 10 microns) and soot <b>particles,</b> however, the <b>emissions</b> of submicron fly ash particles increases simultaneously. Increased mixing rate in the combustion chamber will also decrease the <b>emissions</b> of soot <b>particles.</b> In addition to the operating conditions, significant differences in <b>particle</b> <b>emissions</b> were found between different biomass fuels. For the particles that were dominated by ash elements the <b>particle</b> <b>emissions</b> were correlated to the ash concentration in the unburned fuel.

5000|$|One curiosity is why alpha particles, helium nuclei, {{should be}} {{preferentially}} emitted {{as opposed to}} other particles like a single proton or neutron or other atomic nuclei. Part of the answer comes from conservation of wave function symmetry, which prevents a particle from spontaneously changing from exhibiting Bose-Einstein statistics (if it had an even number of nucleons) to Fermi-Dirac statistics (if it had an odd number of nucleons) or vice versa. Single proton emission, or the emission of any particle with an odd number of nucleons would violate this conservation law. The rest of the answer comes from the very high binding energy of the alpha particle. Computing the total disintegration energy given by the equation:Where [...] is the initial mass of the nucleus, [...] is {{the mass of the}} nucleus after <b>particle</b> <b>emission,</b> and [...] is the mass of the emitted particle, shows that alpha <b>particle</b> <b>emission</b> will usually be possible just with energy from the nucleus itself, while other decay modes will require additional energy. For example, performing the calculation for uranium-232 shows that alpha <b>particle</b> <b>emission</b> would need only 5.4 MeV, while a single proton emission would require 6.1 MeV. Most of this disintegration energy becomes the kinetic energy of the alpha particle itself, although to preserve conservation of momentum part of this energy becomes the recoil of the nucleus itself. However, since the mass numbers of most alpha emitting radioisotopes exceed 210, far greater than the mass number of the alpha particle (4) this difference is generally quite small.|$|E
