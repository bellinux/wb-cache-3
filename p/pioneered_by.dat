5|$|In 1944 the Allies finally {{focused on}} France and the Western Front. Bevan and the London Controlling Section were tasked with inventing an {{elaborate}} masquerade {{to cover the}} Normandy invasion, a vindication of the theory <b>pioneered</b> <b>by</b> Clarke and Wavell: that every real operation should have a complementary deception.|$|E
5|$|The {{balanced}} growth theory {{is an economic}} theory <b>pioneered</b> <b>by</b> the economist Ragnar Nurkse (1907–1959). The theory hypothesises {{that the government of}} any underdeveloped country needs to make large investments in a number of industries simultaneously. This will enlarge the market size, increase productivity, and provide an incentive for the private sector to invest.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginnings}} of the Arts and Crafts movement in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, <b>pioneered</b> <b>by</b> James Ballantine (1808–77). His major works included the great west window of Dunfermline Abbey and the scheme for St. Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh. In Glasgow it was <b>pioneered</b> <b>by</b> Daniel Cottier (1838–91), who had probably studied with Ballantine, and was directly influenced by William Morris, Ford Madox Brown and John Ruskin. His key works included the Baptism of Christ in Paisley Abbey (c. 1880). His followers included Stephen Adam and his son of the same name. The Glasgow-born designer and theorist Christopher Dresser (1834–1904) {{was one of the}} first, and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the Aesthetic Movement and a major contributor to the allied Anglo-Japanese movement.|$|E

5|$|A polystylist, Shostakovich {{developed}} a hybrid voice, combining {{a variety of}} different musical techniques into his works. His music is characterized by sharp contrasts, elements of the grotesque, and ambivalent tonality; the composer was also heavily influenced by the neo-classical style <b>pioneered</b> <b>by</b> Igor Stravinsky, and (especially in his symphonies) by the late Romanticism associated with Gustav Mahler.|$|E
5|$|BART hosts {{car sharing}} {{locations}} at many stations, a program <b>pioneered</b> <b>by</b> City CarShare. Riders can transfer from BART and complete their journeys by car. BART offers long-term airport parking through a third-party vendor at most East Bay stations. Travelers must make an on-line reservation {{in advance and}} pay the daily fee of $5 before they can leave their cars at the BART parking lot.|$|E
5|$|Between 1964 and 1976, 50 {{killer whales}} from the Pacific Northwest were {{captured}} for display in aquaria, and {{public interest in}} the animals grew. In the 1970s, research <b>pioneered</b> <b>by</b> Michael Bigg led {{to the discovery of}} the species' complex social structure, its use of vocal communication, and its extraordinarily stable mother–offspring bonds. Through photo-identification techniques, individuals were named and tracked over decades.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, there were popular hip hop songs, and the celebrities of the scene, like LL Cool J, gained mainstream renown. Other performers experimented with politicized lyrics and social awareness, or fused hip hop with jazz, heavy metal, techno, funk and soul. New styles appeared {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s, like alternative hip hop and the closely related jazz rap fusion, <b>pioneered</b> <b>by</b> rappers like De La Soul.|$|E
5|$|In 1926 Kwee Tek Hoay wrote that, after Allah jang Palsoe, {{the quality}} of stage {{performances}} in the Indies had increased noticeably. Nio notes that the quantity of stage plays by ethnic Chinese authors likewise increased. Though not many were ultimately published, the body of work <b>pioneered</b> <b>by</b> Allah jang Palsoe included plays by Kwee Tek Hoay (Korbannja Kong-Ek, Mait Hidoep, Plesiran Hari Minggoe), Lauw Giok Lan (Pendidikan jang Kliroe), Tio Ie Soei (Jan Tio), and Tjoa Tjien Mo (Beng Lee Koen, Hsi Shih).|$|E
5|$|In 1959 BOAC began {{shifting}} its Comets from transatlantic {{routes and}} released the Comet to associate companies, making the Comet 4's ascendancy as a premier airliner brief. Besides the 707 and DC-8, {{the introduction of}} the Vickers VC10 allowed competing aircraft to assume the high-speed, long-range passenger service role <b>pioneered</b> <b>by</b> the Comet. In 1960, as part of a government-backed consolidation of the British aerospace industry, de Havilland itself was acquired by Hawker Siddeley, within which it became a wholly owned division.|$|E

5|$|Island {{restoration}} techniques, <b>pioneered</b> <b>by</b> New Zealand, {{enable the}} removal of exotic invaders from increasingly large islands. Feral cats {{have been removed from}} Ascension Island, Arctic foxes from many islands in the Aleutian Islands, and rats from Campbell Island. The removal of these introduced species has led to increases in numbers of species under pressure and even the return of extirpated ones. After {{the removal of}} cats from Ascension Island, seabirds began to nest there again {{for the first time in}} over a hundred years.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{methods of}} {{producing}} lager were <b>pioneered</b> <b>by</b> Gabriel Sedlmayr the Younger, who perfected dark brown lagers at the Spaten Brewery in Bavaria, and Anton Dreher, who began brewing a lager (now known as Vienna lager), probably of amber-red colour, in Vienna in 1840–1841. With improved modern yeast strains, most lager breweries use only {{short periods of}} cold storage, typically 1–3 weeks.|$|E

Shastry writes that the work has poetic excellence, variety of meters and dexterity of {{language}} {{which has not been}} seen hitherto in Sanskrit epics. Shastry finds the twentieth canto of the epic to be an excellent illustration of Sanskrit poetry in Prakrit verses, a style which was <b>pioneered</b> <b>by</b> Shastry's father.|$|E

5|$|The Great Depression in Canada {{during the}} early 1930s saw an {{economic}} downturn, leading to hardship across the country. In response to the downturn, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state (as <b>pioneered</b> <b>by</b> Tommy Douglas) in the 1940s and 1950s. On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI, seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence.|$|E
5|$|The Human Genome Project—the largest, {{most costly}} single {{biological}} study ever undertaken—began in 1988 {{under the leadership}} of James D. Watson, after preliminary work with genetically simpler model organisms such as E. coli, S. cerevisiae and C. elegans. Shotgun sequencing and gene discovery methods <b>pioneered</b> <b>by</b> Craig Venter—and fueled by the financial promise of gene patents with Celera Genomics— led to a public–private sequencing competition that ended in compromise with the first draft of the human DNA sequence announced in 2000.|$|E

5|$|The {{science of}} stellar {{spectroscopy}} was <b>pioneered</b> <b>by</b> Joseph von Fraunhofer and Angelo Secchi. By comparing the spectra of {{stars such as}} Sirius to the Sun, they found differences in the strength and number of their absorption lines—the dark lines in a stellar spectra caused by the atmosphere's absorption of specific frequencies. In 1865 Secchi began classifying stars into spectral types. However, the modern version of the stellar classification scheme was developed by Annie J. Cannon during the 1900s.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of templates into the C++ programming language, {{and the advent of}} generic programming techniques <b>pioneered</b> <b>by</b> the Standard Template Library, the need for a mechanism for obtaining the type of an expression, commonly referred to as typeof, was recognized. In generic programming, it is often difficult or impossible to express types that depend on template parameters, in particular the return type of function template instantiations.|$|E
5|$|A {{third part}} of the planet finding mission was the search for Jupiter-mass planets around young stars. The survey would have helped {{scientists}} understand more about solar system formation, including the occurrence of hot Jupiters. This portion of the planet hunt was designed to study systems {{with one or more}} Jupiter mass planets before the system has reached long term equilibrium. Planet hunting techniques using a star's radial velocity cannot measure the regular, tiny to-and-fro wobble motions induced by planets against the strong atmospheric activity of a youthful star. It is through the techniques <b>pioneered</b> <b>by</b> Albert A. Michelson that the SIM {{would have been able to}} execute its three primary planet-finding missions.|$|E
