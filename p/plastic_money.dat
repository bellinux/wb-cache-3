It explores the word ‘money’ itself, contrasting {{the way it is}} used/defined in the economics discourse with the way it has been approached in the psychological discourse. The thesis crosses disciplinary boundaries in an attempt to come closer to the everyday, personal experience of money. It unwraps the childhood history of money, showing how adult money attitudes emerge from unconscious predispositions and childhood experience. It demonstrates the importance of ‘control’ as a variable and the lifelong balancing act which takes place between spending and saving. Today, the form of money {{is in the process of}} change.

Attitudes to the underlying substance 'money' remain relevant, whatever physical form the currency takes. Thus, gold and silver coins, the treasure of childhood pirate stories, may retain mental currency long after their demise as physical currency. Indeed, the more money becomes abstracted from something tangible, the more it is necessary to understand the primal nature of the underpinning attitudes that are affected. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|Not only is a {{community}} at risk, but there are national interest reasons {{to worry about the}} future of the Cocos Islands, writes DAVID CORLETT GHOST CRABS scamper sideways along the beach wearing their pale green armour and orange goggles and boots. They forage for food among the sand and coral litter. A shore break dumps emphatically, sending the crabs rushing for cover lest they be swept out to sea. Beyond the coral table that buffers the shore, the surf, formed all the way across the Indian Ocean, crashes, turning the deep blue water into white foam. This is the ocean side of West Island, one of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The other side of the island, merely a couple of hundred meters away, faces the lagoon. The rest of the island group, formed on top of an ancient volcano, circles the lagoon, protecting the still waters and offering a stark contrast to the pounding ocean. The Cocos Islands are a postcard tropical paradise. Located 2768 kilometres north-west of Perth, this remote Australian territory is home to almost 700 people. About one hundred and twenty of them, originally from mainland Australia, live on West Island. Four hundred and fifty others live quite separately on Home Island. These are the Cocos Malays whose ancestors were brought to the Cocos Islands eight generations ago and worked in feudal conditions under the authority of generations of the Clunies-Ross family. They were denied freedom of movement, kept isolated from visitors, and paid in <b>plastic</b> Clunies-Ross <b>money</b> that was redeemable only at the Clunies-Ross store. This history of geographical, political and personal isolation, combined with a commitment to Islam, strong family linkages and a common language - a version of the old ‘trading Malay’ of the East Indies - contributed to a unique Cocos Malay identity. Even now, with the Cocos Malays more integrated with the outside world than ever, the Home Island community prefers to remain independent of happenings on West Island. Cocos Malay identity is also intimately linked to the islands themselves. According to Michael Simms, chief executive officer of the Shire of Cocos (Keeling) Islands, “The Malays have a strong connection to the place. It’s their home. It’s the only place they’ve ever known. I see them as having a strong connection much the same as the Australian indigenous population do. Traditionally, they’ve lived it, worked it, wanted it. They live off the sea and out of the sea. ” 	All of this may be under threat. The Cocos Islands rise only marginally above the surface of the ocean. According Simms, the kampong or village on Home Island is just 1. 3 meters above sea level. A twenty centimetre levy around the island gives it a bit more height. But with tides rising to 1. 3 meters, the Home Island community is already precariously close to sea inundation. With climate change-induced rising sea levels, the delicate balance seems likely to be broken. There is fierce disagreement about the exact scale of sea level rises. According to the latest report of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, sea levels are likely to rise between 18 and 59 centimetres by 2095, relative to 1990 levels. Although there was a caveat in these figures - they could be revised upwards by 10 to 20 cm - the new report suggested a drop in the rate of sea level rises compared to the IPCC’s 2001 report. 	The 2007 report, however, has been vigorously criticised. A NASA scientist, James Hansen, argues that it dramatically underestimates likely rises in the sea level. He suggests that if the earth’s temperature rises between two and three degrees Celsius, the ice sheets in both Greenland and west Antarctica are likely to collapse, causing sea levels to rise by one metre every twenty years. The IPCC predicted temperature rises of between 2 and 6 degrees Celsius if greenhouse gases are not reduced. In August, Professor Stephan Rahmstorf, a key scientific contributor to the IPCC’s report, said that it did not include the full impact of the melting of the polar ice caps because too little is known about the long term risks. He suggested that sea levels could rise between 50 centimetres and 1. 4 metres by the end of the century. Unless the coral that protects the Cocos Islands can keep up with the rising waters, Home Island, the most populated and vulnerable of the group, will be swamped at high tide even if the sea rises only to the lowest of the predictions. Flooding, salifying of fresh water and coastal erosion will follow. At the higher end of the predictions Home Island will simply disappear. The Australian government has declined to resettle Pacific islanders who are threatened with forced migration due to climate change-related factors. It will have little choice with the Cocos Malays. They are, after all, Australian citizens. And there is some irony in the fact that they are also devout Muslims. Commentators from the Right who have been calling for an end to Muslim immigration to Australia will have to accept that the Cocos Malays have as much claim to be in this country as they themselves have, notwithstanding the islanders’ commitment to Islam. By any measure, the Howard government has been tardy on climate change. The Prime Minister until recently was a well-known climate change sceptic. While he cannot be blamed for the Cocos Malay’s predicament, his failure to engage effectively both locally and internationally on climate change has done little to assist in finding them a resolution. If the Climate Institute’s ‘election report card’ is any thing to go by, there is little in the Coalition’s recent policy announcements to give the Cocos Island community much comfort. The ALP’s policy announcements to date do not score a whole lot better. Election promises notwithstanding, it is the government and not the opposition whose eleven-year record on this issue that is there to be assessed. And on climate change, the Howard Government is a failure. This is true even on the terms preferred by the Prime Minister - a narrowly defined understanding of the national interest. The Cocos Islands are a strategic outpost for Australia. The airstrip on West Island is used by planes that monitor Australia’s northern waters for unauthorised boat arrivals and for illegal fishing. West Island is also a stop-off point for Royal Australian Air Force planes on their way to and from the Middle East. It is a place on which to rest en route to Iraq and to get smashed at the Cocos Club before returning to a life of peace in Australia. If sea levels rise to the degree that some experts predict, this strategically valuable territory may be lost to future Australians. But for the Cocos Malays and for the others who live on the Cocos Islands, including the ghost crabs, it is not strategic importance that matters. • David Corlett is the author of Following Them Home: The Fate of the Returned Asylum Seekers (Black Inc, 2005) and is currently researching a book on climate change and forced migration.

Unlike magnetic stripe cards, chip cards (also called EMV cards) use superior technology that helps guard against skimming and cloning. When we swipe our card at shopping malls and restaurants or use it at the ATM to withdraw cash and pay utility bills, we are under the constant threat of our cards being counterfeited. Besides, if you lose your card, someone can misuse the time lag, between your losing and blocking the card, to swipe and imitate your signature at the point of sale (POS). Lack of adequate security and authentication procedures specifically in card present transactions(i,e transactions at POS and ATMs) have led to billions of dollars losses annually.
