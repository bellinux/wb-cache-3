Regarding {{persecution}} and health awareness for albinos the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> project is to dispel any superstitions associated with albinism {{and the potential for}} persecution by facilitating workshops in the villages targeting nine key villages in the Mara village where albinos are most prominent: Bukumi, Bugoji, Bwai Kwitururu, Chimati, Chitare, Chumwi, Kataryo, Kiriba and Wanyere. Here the aims of UTSS sensitize communities to albinism to reduce stigma, discrimination and violence through the form of Educating communities about the facts and falsehoods surrounding albinism, and therefore subsequently increasing community understanding, acceptance and respect toward albinism {{and the people who are}} suffering from persecution due to their condition. UTSS also works on an educational level to provide ways children with albinism with low vision can improve learning abilities and overall aiming to de-stigmatize albinism and facilitate social inclusion and safety of albinos in their families and local community.|$|E

In most instances, Indigenous people would not be before the courts without having been previously charged by the police with an offence. Indeed, for public-order offences in particular, the police play a direct role in observing and defining <b>the</b> commission <b>of</b> an "offence" and apprehending the offender. In this sense, there is a symbiotic link between policing and offending.
