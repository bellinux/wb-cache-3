We consider three ubiquitous processes: an industrial dryer, a level tank, and a continuous stirred tank reactor. For these applications, we compared three <b>particle</b> <b>filtering</b> variants: standard <b>particle</b> <b>filtering,</b> Rao-Blackwellised <b>particle</b> <b>filtering</b> and a version of Rao-Blackwellised <b>particle</b> <b>filtering</b> that does one-step look-ahead to select good sampling regions.

30|$|<b>Particle</b> <b>filtering</b> is a {{numerical}} Bayesian technique that has {{great potential for}} solving sequential estimation problems involving non-linear and non-Gaussian models. Since the estimation accuracy achieved by <b>particle</b> <b>filters</b> improves {{as the number of}} particles increases, it is natural to consider as many particles as possible. MapReduce is a generic programming model that makes it possible to scale a wide variety of algorithms to Big data. However, despite the application of <b>particle</b> <b>filters</b> across many domains, little attention has been devoted to implementing <b>particle</b> <b>filters</b> using MapReduce.|$|R
25|$|Particle {{filters are}} often included, because in many cases, the {{hazardous}} materials {{are in the}} form of mist, which is captured already by the <b>particle</b> <b>filter</b> before entering the chemical adsorber. Filtration may be aided with an air pump to improve wearer comfort. Filtration of air is only possible if there is sufficient oxygen in the first place. Thus, when handling asphyxiants, or when ventilation is poor or the hazards are unknown, filtration is not possible and air must be supplied from a pressurized bottle as in scuba diving. Also, a gas mask does not protect against other hazards; for example, corrosive gases can damage the skin, requiring full-body protection.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{parameter}} estimation, the ABC-framework {{can be used}} {{to compute}} the posterior probabilities of different candidate models. In such applications, one possibility is to use the rejection-sampling in a hierarchical manner. First, a model is sampled from the prior distribution for the models; then, given the model sampled, the model parameters are sampled from the prior distribution assigned to that model. Finally, a simulation is performed as in the single-model ABC. The relative acceptance frequencies for the different models now approximate the posterior distribution for these models. Again, computational improvements for ABC in the space of models have been proposed, such as constructing a <b>particle</b> <b>filter</b> in the joint space of models and parameters.|$|E

Armed variants would carry up to four HOT (Haut subsonique Optiquement Téléguidé Tiré d'un Tube) wire-guided anti-tank missiles, or a forward firing 20mm cannon mounted to the fuselage sides with its ammunition supply placed in the cabin.

While the Gazelle had been developed under a military-orientated design programme, following the type's entry to service increasing attention to the commercial market was paid as well. The type was marketed to civil customers; notably, civilian operator Vought Helicopters at one point had a fleet of at least 70 Gazelles. Civil-orientated Gazelles often included an external baggage access door mounted beneath the main cabin.|$|E

2500|$|The {{ensemble}} Kalman filter (EnKF) is a recursive filter {{suitable for}} {{problems with a}} large number of variables, such as discretizations of partial differential equations in geophysical models. The EnKF originated as a version of the Kalman filter for large problems (essentially, the covariance matrix is replaced by the sample covariance), and it is now an important data assimilation component of ensemble forecasting. EnKF is related to the <b>particle</b> <b>filter</b> (in this context, a particle is the same thing as ensemble member) but the EnKF makes the assumption that all probability distributions involved are Gaussian; [...] when it is applicable, it is much more efficient than the <b>particle</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E

[...] The filter is made so that the asbestos fibres cannot be breathed in, if the filter layer is not damaged.. [...] Nearly all Russian Cold War period masks contain asbestos, however, only the ones produced before 1972 pose a threat, and even then, the construction of the mask makes it impossible to breathe the asbestos in if not damaged.|$|E

30|$|In the {{previous}} sections, we {{have investigated the}} <b>particle</b> <b>filtering</b> methods and state estimation for networked systems, respectively. In the cases where nonlinear systems or non-Gaussian PDFs are addressed, <b>particle</b> <b>filtering</b> becomes a more suitable choice. The applications of PF to networked systems, however, {{have given rise to}} some new challenges. This is mainly because in <b>particle</b> <b>filtering</b> methods, a large amount of particles are required to represent the posterior PDF, which implies a huge communication burden if local information is exchanged among nodes. One major concern of <b>particle</b> <b>filtering</b> for networked systems is, therefore, how to achieve an affordable communication cost while maintaining an acceptable accuracy. On the other hand, the network-induced phenomena should also be addressed when PF is applied to networked systems. In this section, we will discuss the applications of PF algorithms to the filtering problems of networked systems, highlighting how the network-induced phenomena are treated by <b>particle</b> <b>filters</b> and how, in networked systems, local <b>particle</b> <b>filters</b> work coordinately to accomplish the state estimation task with an affordable communication cost.|$|R

In order to avoid the difficulty of solving the problem globally for the region to be inpainted, we introduce a field of local <b>particle</b> <b>filters.</b> The states of the <b>particle</b> <b>filters</b> are image patches. Global consistency is enforced by a Markov random field image model which connects neighbouring <b>particle</b> <b>filters.</b> The benefit of using locally interacting <b>particle</b> <b>filters</b> is that several competing hypotheses on inpainting solutions are kept active, allowing the method to provide globally consistent solutions on problems where other local methods may fail.
