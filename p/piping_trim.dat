5000|$|Number Six {{typically}} wears a {{dark brown}} jacket with off-white <b>piping</b> <b>trim</b> (often {{mistaken for a}} black jacket in some lighting conditions, but the original has been seen by fans in Portmeirion in the 1980s and is unfaded dark brown all over), a dark blue rollneck sweater, tan slacks, dark blue boating shoes with white soles, and forsakes his [...] "6" [...] ID badge. There were at least two dark jackets, with slight differences in the cream-coloured piping. Little is known about Number Six's background other than that he fought in a war against Germany and was born on 19 March 1928 (which is also McGoohan's birthday). The flashback setup in [...] "Once Upon a Time" [...] suggests that Number Six was a bomber crewman, most likely with RAF Bomber Command. His seated position relative to the pilot (portrayed in illusion by Number Two) indicates {{that he was a}} bombardier/navigator. In the episode [...] "Many Happy Returns" [...] he claims that his name is [...] "Peter Smith" [...] and expects it to appear on his house lease and car log book. In the episode [...] "Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling" [...] the Prisoner, in another man's body, reveals that he was at one point engaged to the daughter of one of his superiors. He refuses to cooperate, despite constant efforts by Number Two to get information from him.|$|E
50|$|The {{suit was}} double-breasted, with six gold buttons and four square pockets, two on each side. The fabric {{was a light}} weight wool from Linton Tweeds in a nubby weave known as bouclé. The color was {{raspberry}} although most press reports described it as strawberry pink. The wide quilted collar, jacket lining along with the <b>piping</b> <b>trim</b> on the sleeves {{and at the top}} of each pocket was navy blue silk. There were two gold buttons on each sleeve. The suit came with a sleeveless navy silk shell blouse. For cool weather, Kennedy would wear a matching navy silk scarf knotted at the neck and tucked into the front of the jacket, which she did in Dallas. Accompanying the suit was a trademark pillbox hat in matching pink with a band of navy piping around the crown. Kennedy carried a navy handbag with gold buckle and gold chain handle. She wore low heeled navy shoes with a small gold ornament at the toe. A gold bangle bracelet on her left wrist and short white kid leather gloves with tiny wrist buttons completed her outfit. Most of the American public viewing pictures of the presidential couple on television and in newspapers between 1961 and 1963 would not have known the color of the suit, given {{that at the time of}} the assassination TV news was still in black and white and newspapers did not print color photographs. The color of the suit became widely known only after the publication of color photos in Life magazine's JFK memorial issue November 29,1963 and in Life's Warren Commission report issue October 2,1964.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} sports figurine most {{popularly known}} was Johnny Hero [...] "in the year 1965, {{just a year}} after G.I. Joe; the figure had silk track shorts and short-sleeve shirt with <b>trim</b> (<b>piping)</b> and was produced by Rosko Industries of New York". Unlike today, figurines back then came with removable clothing. Kids could change the attire of Johnny Hero to any team they preferred. These figurines were first offered in SEARS catalogs during 1955 and 1956. [...] "In 1968 Johnny Hero was repackaged as Olympic Hero. The base figure was sold in a box similar to the GI Joe figures of the time. His base outfit included a red long-sleeve jogging suit (the top had [...] "Johnny Hero" [...] and the number 16 printed on the front), gold shorts, white socks and white tennis shoes. NFL, AFL and MLB team uniforms were sold separately. NFL / AFL uniforms included fabric jerseys and pants, shoulder and knee pads, socks, a football and a plastic helmet. Baseball uniforms included shirt, pants, socks, hat, baseball, bat and glove". Johnny Hero is well known enough today that {{he has his own}} Facebook Page.“Anecdotal research and subjective inquiryhave been aided by secondary research todemonstrate consistency of information and opinion on this subject.” ...|$|R
50|$|Navy blue frock coats {{with light}} tape trim {{on the edge}} of the collar, pointed cuff decoration, and {{striping}} on the trousers, following in accordance to VA state regulations of this year. They wore a shako in similar pattern and color as the Richmond Grays (later Co. G, one of the shakos can be seen in Time Life's Echoes of Glory series), with the plate and pompom devices. The trim may be sky blue, white, yellow, or gold, however the way photos were taken in the 19th century, yellow and gold often appears dark, almost black, so this is a stretch of whether or not this is a possibility.One photograph depicts three members of Co. A, The one at left wears a battle shirt of lighter colored material than the trousers, a large white stand and fall collar, with a black or navy blue cord-tie coming down from the collar, with 4-5 buttons down the front, and no trim is seen; a white leather or cotton belt with a large plate is worn; the trousers are Navy blue with the same <b>piping</b> or tape <b>trim</b> down the seam: The center man wears the dress frock coat without the shako and accoutrements, 3 buttons adorn the cuffs, and infantry hunting horns/bugles are present on the collar, approx. 2 inches from the opening; he too wears the same style belt and plate: The man on the right wears a shell jacket made of a lighter material than the trousers, however it is difficult to say from the image alone whether it is grey or blue in color; it has the same design trim as the dress frock coat, minus the collar horn insignia and is shorter than the frocks’ collar is cut; he too wears the same style trousers.One photograph taken at Poplar Lawn, February, 1861, shows the Petersburg City Guard in full dress and marching order. They wear the frock coats and white accoutrement straps, with the shakos in similar description to the Richmond Grays, with the officer in center wearing light epaulets, assumedly gold; however the image is not clear enough to show the detail of the devices on the front of the shakos.|$|R
