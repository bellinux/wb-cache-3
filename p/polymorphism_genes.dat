40|$|Marine organisms {{experience}} {{a broad range}} of intrinsic and extrinsic influences during their lives, which impact their population dynamics and genetic structure. Subtle interpopulation differences reflect the continuity of the marine environment, but also pose challenges to those wishing to define management units. The catadromous European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is no exception. Its spawning habitat in the Sargasso Sea and long migration across the North Atlantic qualify it as marine. However, the synergy between hydrographic variability, changing climate, and the impacts of habitat degradation and overfishing in continental waters has negatively affected stock sizes. Its protracted spawning period, variance in age-at-maturity, parental contribution and reproductive success, and the difficulty in sampling the spawning region together may mask a weak geographical genetic differentiation. Recent genetic data report evidence for spatial as well as temporal differences between populations, with the temporal heterogeneity between intra-annual recruitment and annual cohorts exceeding the spatial differences. Despite its common name of ‘fresh-water eel’, the European eel should really be managed on a North Atlantic scale. The fishery may have to be curtailed, migration routes kept open and water quality restored if it is to survive. Eel aquaculture has to focus on efficient rearing in the short term and controlled breeding in the long term. Future research on eel genetics should focus on (i) sampling and analysing spawning populations and recruitment waves to detect spatio-temporally discrete groups, and establishing a biological baseline from pre-decline historical collections for critical long-term monitoring and modelling of its genetic composition; (ii) the analysis of adaptive genetic <b>polymorphism</b> (<b>genes</b> under selection) to detect adaptive divergence between populations, perhaps requiring separate management strategies; and (iii) improving artificial reproduction to protect natural stocks from heavy exploitation, especially now the species has been categorized as endangered (Maes and Volckaert, 2007) ...|$|E
40|$|Variation in {{the levels}} of sex-steroid hormones results from {{differences}} in developmental conditions, adult lifestyle, and genetic <b>polymorphism.</b> <b>Genes</b> involved in sex-steroid biosynthesis have been implicated to influence levels of hormones in premenopausal women, but the results were inconclusive. We tested variation among women in levels of salivary estradiol (E 2) corresponding to CYP 17 genotypes. CYP 17 encodes cytochrome P 450 c 17 A, which mediates two enzymes important in E 2 synthesis. In contrast to the earlier studies that relied on {{one or a few}} samples for assessing the E 2 levels of an individual woman, our study is based on daily collected saliva samples for one entire menstrual cycle. Sixty Polish women, ages 24 to 36 years, with regular menstrual cycles and no reported fertility problems participated in the study. Women with A 2 /A 2 genotype had 54 % higher mean E 2 levels than women with A 1 /A 1 genotype (P = 0. 0001) and 37 % higher than women with A 1 /A 2 genotype (P = 0. 0008). Heterozygous A 1 /A 2 women had 13 % higher E 2 levels than homozygous A 1 /A 1 women (but this difference was significant only in a nonparametric test). Levels of E 2 during the day with highest E 2 (day 1) were 72 % higher in A 2 /A 2 compared with A 1 /A 1 (P = 0. 01) and 52 % higher compared with A 1 /A 2 (P = 0. 03). Our results suggest that CYP 17 genotype may serve as a biomarker of endocrine function in women of reproductive age. (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2006; 15 (11) : 2131 – 5...|$|E
40|$|Elucidating the {{mechanisms}} promoting and maintaining adaptive genetic diversity (i. e., variation at loci with a {{direct effect on}} fitness) is a central issue in evolutionary and conservation biology. Due to their essential role in pathogen resistance and extraordinary levels of <b>polymorphism,</b> <b>genes</b> of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) constitute perfect candidates for studying adaptive genetic variability. However, despite the accumulation of empirical data, estimating the relative contribution of adaptive against non-adaptive processes that drive the MHC evolution in natural populations is still challenging, and consequently requires further investigation. 	 	In this thesis, my general aim {{was to understand the}} pattern of MHC evolution by using the European populations of barn owl (Tyto alba) as model species. We adopted a sampling strategy including individuals from family data, for which fitness-related trait information from experimental data were available, as well as an extensive number of individuals from many localities in Europe. This sampling resulted in a total of 1 ' 300 barn owls that were sequenced for both MHC class Iα exon 3 (MHC-I) and MHC class IIβ exon 2 (MHC-IIB) using a high-throughput sequencing technology. Our strategy allowed us to address some of the important topics in the MHC field, i. e. MHC genotyping, molecular evolution of MHC genes, the link between MHC diversity and individual fitness-related traits, and the spatial pattern of MHC diversity. 	I first characterized the diversity at the two MHC classes (MHC-I and MHC-IIB), and revealed only two duplicated genes in each class. All four genes displayed the characteristics of functional MHC genes, i. e. footprints of historical positive selection, high genetic diversity, and footprints of recombination and gene conversion. Additionally, I highlighted a remarkable discrepancy in the evolutionary dynamic between the two MHC classes, where alleles between MHC-I genes were extremely homogenized, while the ones at MHC-IIB genes were strongly divergent. These findings suggest that the different evolutionary histories at the two MHC classes may constrain or promote the evolution for an optimal MHC-mediated pathogen defence. Taking advantage of this detailed characterization, in a follow-up study, I investigated whether specific aspects of MHC diversity (i. e. high diversity or specific alleles) confer higher immunocompetence. Overall I found low support in this sense, but most importantly these results highlighted that if an effect exists, it is of small to moderate effect size, which is important for future studies in order to achieve enough power to detect small-effects associations. Finally, I took a global view and investigated the pattern of MHC diversity across Europe. I found that MHC diversity has been mainly driven by the species colonization history, even if certain localities show intriguing patterns that may allow me to think that selection has also contributed to shape MHC diversity. This study revealed the complexity of distinguishing the relative contribution of evolutionary forces shaping the spatial MHC diversity and requires pathogen community information to properly discern the forces in action. 	The findings of this PhD, using a multilevel approach coupled with high throughput sequencing technologies, have permitted to bring new insights into the MHC evolutionary ecology, but have also opened new challenging perspectives, such as the importance of using genomic scans and sampling strategy efforts, in order to overcome the general difficulty of fully understanding the outcomes of host-pathogen interactions...|$|E

The most frequent and severe cardiovascular disease is coronary artery disease resulting from coronary arteries’ atherosclerosis. Though many risk factors that increase the risk of coronary artery disease have been identified, such as high levels of LDL- and total cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and smoking, researchers have focused on the genetic background of coronary artery disease by analyzing genetic factors that either independently or in interaction with known risk factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Genetics of cardiovascular disease is a wide field consisting of association studies of <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> with disease. Coronary artery disease is a multifactorial disease of complex genetic aetiology and thus there are reports on many gene candidates.

ResultsIn CYP 46 A 1 <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphism,</b> TT genotype and T allele were found to be associated with a significantly decreased risk of POAG whereas the CT, CC genotypes and C allele were associated with an increased risk of POAG in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals. In PPAR-γ <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphism,</b> only GG genotype was nearly associated with POAG in only hypertensive cases. ConclusionsCYP 46 A 1 (rs 754203) <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphism</b> was associated with POAG in both hypertensive and normotensive patients whereas, only GG genotype of PPAR-γ (rs 10865710) SNP shows significant association with POAG in hypertensive POAG patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSickle cell anemia (SCA) is a {{disorder}} {{characterized by a}} heterogeneous clinical outcome. In the present study, we investigated the associations between Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) − 308 G>A and Interleukin 8 (IL- 8) − 251 A>T <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphisms,</b> medical history and classical biomarkers in children with steady-state SCA. In total, 210 SCA patients aged 2 – 21 years and 200 healthy controls were studied. <b>Gene</b> <b>polymorphisms,</b> betaS-globin haplotypes and a 3. 7 -kb deletion in alpha 2 -thalassemia (α 2 -thal 3. 7 kb) were investigated by PCR/RFLP analysis, and cytokine levels were determined by ELISA. Splenomegaly (p=. 032) was more prevalent among children younger than 5 years of age. The A allele of the TNF-alpha − 308 G>A <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphism</b> {{and the presence of}} α 2 -thal 3. 7 kb were associated with an increase risk of splenic sequestration events (p=. 001; p=. 046), while the T allele of the IL- 8 − 251 A>T <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphism</b> was considered to be a protective factor for splenomegaly events (p=. 032). Moreover, the A allele of the TNF-alpha − 308 G>A <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphism</b> was associated with high TNF-alpha levels (p=. 021), and the hemoglobin F and hemoglobin S haplotypes were correlated with serum levels of IL- 8. The logistic regression analysis showed significant effects of the TNF-alpha and IL- 8 <b>gene</b> <b>polymorphisms,</b> betaS-globin <b>gene</b> haplotypes and α 2 -thal 3. 7 kb on the occurrence of splenic sequestration events. Our study emphasizes that the identification of new genetic and immunological biomarkers and their associations with classical markers is an important strategy to elucidate the underlying causes of different SCA phenotypes and their effects on patient outcome...|$|R

40|$|Coccidioides posadasii sp. nov., {{formerly}} known as non-California (non-CA) Coccidioides immitis, is described. Phylogenetic analyses using single nucleotide <b>polymorphisms,</b> <b>genes,</b> and microsatellites show that C. posadasii represents a divergent, genetically recombining monophyletic clade. Coccidioides posadasii can be distinguished from C. immitis by numerous DNA polymorphisms, and we show how either of two microsatellite loci {{may be used as}} diagnostic markers for this species. Growth experiments show that C. posadasii has significantly slower growth rates on high-salt media when compared with C. immitis, suggesting that other phenotypic characters may exist.
