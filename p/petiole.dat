5|$|Although the {{hypothesised}} {{description of}} what Mesozoic ants looked like was somewhat accurate when compared to actual specimens, some characteristics were inaccurate. They believed that ant-like mandibles first appeared before {{the development of an}} ant-like <b>petiole,</b> but such case was proven false when it was opposite on S. freyi specimens (ant-like <b>petiole</b> first appeared before the development of ant-like mandibles). Based on drawings, it was suggested that Mesozoic ants had long mandibles with multiple teeth, toothed tarsal claws and a broadly jointed <b>petiole.</b> Examination of collected specimens, however, shows that these ants had very short mandibles, toothless tarsal claws and a separated <b>petiole.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ants are {{distinct}} in their morphology from other insects in having elbowed antennae, metapleural glands, {{and a strong}} constriction of their second abdominal segment into a node-like <b>petiole.</b> The head, mesosoma, and metasoma are the three distinct body segments. The <b>petiole</b> forms a narrow waist between their mesosoma (thorax plus the first abdominal segment, which is fused to it) and gaster (abdomen less the abdominal segments in the <b>petiole).</b> The <b>petiole</b> may be formed by one or two nodes (the second alone, or {{the second and third}} abdominal segments).|$|E
5|$|According to Li (2005), several {{morphological}} {{features of}} A. longicervia indicate {{a close relationship}} to Sarraceniaceae: both taxa exhibit one or two pitcher wings, a smooth peristome, and pitchers that extend vertically {{from the top of}} a short <b>petiole.</b>|$|E
40|$|Auxin {{transport}} {{was examined}} in leaf <b>petioles</b> {{taken from the}} upper, middle, and lower leaf canopy of large cotton plants. The ability of <b>petioles</b> to transport auxin decreased with age (position) of the leaves. Plant water deficit reduced transport regardless of age. These correlations {{support the view that}} reduced transport capacity of <b>petioles</b> plays {{a significant role in the}} induction of abscission of lower or older leaves during water deficits...|$|R
40|$|The use of etiolated <b>petioles</b> as explants {{permitted}} the complete elimination of microbial contamination in the tissue culture of cyclamen. The regenerative potential of etiolated <b>petioles</b> {{was superior to}} those of normal, non-etiolated <b>petioles.</b> The culture in the dark enhanced the growth of explants and their shoot differentiation. An optimum composition of basal medium for cyclamen cultures in vitro was proposed as 1 / 3 strength of MS medium...|$|R
50|$|Viola palustris is a 5 to 22 cm, glabrous herb with <b>petioles</b> and peduncles from slender rhizomes. The cordate to {{reniform}} {{leaves are}} 2.5 to 3.5 cm wide with coarse, shallow, blunt teeth. <b>Petioles</b> are 2 to 17 cm. The white to lilac flowers are 10 to 13 mm long. Peduncles {{are about the}} same length as <b>petioles.</b> The lower three petals have purple lines. The lateral pair are lightly bearded.|$|R
5|$|Based on observations, Iridomyrmex {{workers can}} be {{deformed}} {{when they are}} born. For example, a captured specimen had its propodeum and gaster fused together, and the <b>petiole</b> was still present but enlarged. Despite the deformity, the worker {{was still able to}} forage with little trouble.|$|E
5|$|The leaf {{blades of}} the summer rosettes of P. moranensis are smooth, rigid, and succulent, varying from bright yellow-green to maroon in colour. The laminae are {{generally}} obovate to orbicular, between 5.5 and 13centimeters (2–5in.) long and supported by a 1 to 3.5centimetre (⅜–1⅜in.) <b>petiole.</b>|$|E
5|$|Four pilosity {{patterns}} (patterns of hair-like setae) {{are known}} to occur within Tatuidris collections. Pilosity pattern A consists of a mix of both long flexuous and short appressed setae. This {{is the most common}} pilosity pattern and the one that most resembles the type specimens from El Salvador and the gyne from Otongachi, Ecuador. Pilosity pattern B is characterized by very short, fully appressed, and regular spaced setae arrayed homogeneously and equidistantly on the head, mesosoma, <b>petiole,</b> postpetiole and gaster. Pilosity pattern C is characterized by dense lanose-looking setae. Pilosity pattern D consists of short and uniform decumbent (strongly inclined but not fully appressed) setae scattered throughout the body.|$|E
50|$|The large cordate or sagittate leaves grow to {{a length}} of 20 to 90 cm on long <b>petioles.</b> Their araceous flowers grow {{at the end of}} a short stalk, but are not conspicuous; often hidden behind the leaf <b>petioles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The adults produce {{characteristic}} feeding {{scars on}} {{the leaves and}} <b>petioles.</b> In the larval stage, the insect tunnels into the <b>petioles</b> and the crown of the plant. This feeding results in biotic stress, reduced flowers and seeds, and less vigorous growth.|$|R
40|$|<b>Petioles</b> of Mon Ngot (Sweet taro, Colocasia esculenta) {{are widely}} grown in Thua Thien Hue Province in Viet Nam {{and they are}} an {{important}} ingredient in the popular local dishes Com Hen and Canh Chua Bac Ha. During {{the preparation of the}} <b>petioles</b> the tough, fibrous outer skin, known to cause itchy throats, is removed. In the preparation of Com Hen the outer skin is removed sliced and washed while the preparation of Canh Chua Bac Ha, involves the natural fermentation of the peeled <b>petioles</b> with Lactobacillus to give a more even taste. This experiment investigated the effect of removing the outer skin on the oxalate composition of the washed and cooked stems, the effect of cooking the these <b>petioles</b> for 10, 15 and 20 minutes to encourage increased leaching of soluble oxalates into the cooking water and the effect of fermentation of the <b>petioles</b> with Lactobacilllus for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Taro <b>petioles</b> constitute between 30 % and 40 % of the final local dishes. These dishes do not include foods high in calcium that would bind soluble oxalate. This emphasises the importance of adequate processes for removing soluble oxalates prior to consumption...|$|R
5|$|The genus is {{characterized}} by workers which have head-capsules that are trapazoidal in shape, narrowing at the front and widening towards {{the rear of the}} capsule. The oval compound eyes are generally placed slightly {{to the rear of the}} capsules midpoint, and lacking ocelli completely. The mandibles have a number of teeth along the masticatory margin (the middle area of the mandibles) and an overall triangular shape. The gaster has a flat first tergite that does not cover the <b>petiole,</b> a flat fourth abdominal sternite.|$|E
5|$|Like all insects, wasps {{have a hard}} {{exoskeleton}} {{which protects}} their three main body parts, the head, the mesosoma (including the thorax and the first segment of the abdomen) and the metasoma. There is a narrow waist, the <b>petiole,</b> joining {{the first and second}} segments of the abdomen. The two pairs of membranous wings are held together by small hooks and the forewings are larger than the hind ones; in some species, the females have no wings. In females there is usually a rigid ovipositor which may be modified for injecting venom, piercing or sawing. It either extends freely or can be retracted, and may be developed into a stinger for both defence and for paralysing prey.|$|E
5|$|Narcissus {{plants have}} one to several basal leaves which are linear, ligulate or strap shaped (long and narrow), {{sometimes}} channelled adaxially to semiterete, and may (pedicellate) {{or may not}} (sessile) have a <b>petiole</b> stalk. The leaves are flat and broad to cylindrical at the base and arise from the bulb. The emerging plant generally has two leaves, but the mature plant usually three, rarely four, and they are covered with a cutin containing cuticle, giving them a waxy appearance. Leaf colour is light green to blue-green. In the mature plant the leaves extend higher than the flower stem, but in some species the leaves are low hanging. The leaf base is encased in a colourless sheath. After flowering the leaves turn yellow and die back once the seed pod (fruit) is ripe.|$|E
5000|$|A stipule is [...] "interpetiolar" [...] if it {{is located}} in between the <b>petioles,</b> {{as opposed to being}} {{attached}} to the <b>petioles,</b> and generally one stipule from each leaf is fused together, so it appears that there's just one stipule between each leaf.|$|R
50|$|One {{characteristic}} feature {{found on}} leaves is {{the formation of}} bright orange droplets oozing out from above and below water soaked leaf surfaces. As a result, the droplets dry out {{during the day and}} become crusty. Another sign of P. colocasiae infection are masses of sporangia that form a white, powdery ring around the lesion. Symptoms on <b>petioles</b> includes gray to brownish black lesions that can occur anywhere on the <b>petioles.</b> <b>Petioles</b> become soft and may break as the pathogen destroys the host.|$|R

5|$|The gastral {{segments}} {{have small}} constrictions {{between the first}} and second segments. The stinger is long but largely internalized, and it is also stout and slightly upcurved apically. The external parts are enclosed by the gonostyli, and the sting bulb is large. The integument (a protective outer layer) is rugose throughout except on the legs and gaster. The dorsofrontal area of the head (the back of an insect), and the dorsal surfaces of the gaster, mesosoma and <b>petiole</b> are covered by erect hairs, and slightly longer hairs are present on the ventral regions of the mesosoma and gaster. The apical segments of the gaster have a greater density of setose (bristles) with longer decumbent hairs (meaning that these hairs are lying down).|$|E
5|$|After they hatch, {{the small}} {{caterpillars}} only eat the tissue (parenchyma) between the veins of the leaves. They {{do this to}} avoid the sticky and toxic latex produced by the plant's laticifers and transported in the veins. After 3–4 days, the caterpillars also eat flowers, fruit, tendrils, petioles and young stems (as well as continuing to eat leaves), defoliating the entire plant. They are particularly fond of the glands {{at the base of}} the leaf, near the <b>petiole.</b> They can deal with the chemical defences in the latex, which does not cause the problem of mouthpart coagulation. The caterpillars spin silk from their mouth with an '∞' motion of the head as they walk, this keeps them from falling from the smooth surface of the leaves. The silk also permits them to climb back to the plant should they fall. Strong rain makes them fall despite the silk. There are four instars, and the caterpillar stage lasts from two months in the warm season to two and a half to three months in the cold season. The caterpillar is whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and is covered in club-ended black setae. It has five pairs of prolegs on segments 3 to 6 and 10, and six true legs attached to the thorax.|$|E
5|$|Ants of this genus are {{considered}} to be the most primitive within the family Formicidae. The body presents a wasp-like structure but with several ant-like characteristics. These ant-like characteristics, however, are primitive compared to more modern ants, and thus it is intermediate with other primitive ants and aculeate wasps. The presence of the metapleural gland, the nodiform (a structure resembling a node, which is a segment found between the mesosoma and gaster, the bulbous posterior portion of the metasoma), the structure of the <b>petiole</b> and its general physical appearance of an ant concludes Sphecomyrma species are ants rather than wasps; the absence of the metapleural gland would mean that it is most likely a wasp instead of an ant. It is not exactly known which group of wasps are the descendants of Sphecomyrma, but members of the family Tiphiidae, particularly those in the genus Methocha are strikingly similar with Sphecomyrma. Wilson placed the genus closest to the Tiphiidae among extant wasps, but a later study published in 1975 derives the ants from a later clade and not to the Tiphiidae.|$|E

5|$|In Barden and Grimaldi's article, {{the authors}} could not {{sufficiently}} identify the ant with enough confidence {{to place it}} in a subfamily. Instead, it was incertae sedis within the Formicidae. Although a recent published morphological study provided useful information on the mouthparts of basal ants, placing Cretaceous taxa is still difficult. However, synapomorphies (key diagnostic traits) {{could have been used}} to attempt to place Zigrasimecia. Key synapomorphies for Sphecomyrmine ants include scape (the base segment of the antenna) length; <b>petiole</b> (narrow waist between the thorax and abdomen); and the metapleural gland (secretory glands), as indicated by Barry Bolton's diagnosis. The morphology of Z. tonsora shows a variety of autapomorphies (derived traits) not seen in any other ant species, particularly the structure of the mandibles and mesosomal sculpturing. Another issue in placing Z. tonsora is that the status of Sphecomyrminae had rarely ever been evaluated (perhaps once) via phylogenetic methodology. Due to this, it was possible that the subfamily was not monophyletic.|$|E
5|$|Sphecomyrma is an extinct genus of ants which {{existed in}} the Cretaceous {{approximately}} 79 to 92 million years ago. The first specimens were collected in 1966, found embedded in amber which had been exposed in the cliffs of Cliffwood, New Jersey, by Edmund Frey and his wife. In 1967, zoologists E. O. Wilson, Frank Carpenter and William L. Brown, Jr. published a paper describing and naming Sphecomyrma freyi. They described an ant with a mosaic of features, a mix of characteristics from modern ants and aculeate wasps. It possessed a metapleural gland, a feature unique to ants, it was wingless and possessed a <b>petiole</b> which was ant-like in form. The mandibles were short and wasp-like with only two teeth, the gaster constricted and the middle and hind legs had double tibial spurs. The antennae were, in form, midway between the wasps and ants, having a short first segment but a long flexible funiculus. Two additional species, S. canadensis and S. mesaki, were described in 1985 and 2005 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The koala {{has several}} adaptations for its {{eucalypt}} diet, {{which is of}} low nutritive value, of high toxicity, and high in dietary fibre. The animal's dentition consists of the incisors and cheek teeth (a single premolar and four molars on each jaw), which are separated by a large gap (a characteristic feature of herbivorous mammals). The incisors are used for grasping leaves, which are then passed to the premolars to be snipped at the <b>petiole</b> before being passed to the highly cusped molars, where they are shredded into small pieces. Koalas may also store food in their cheek pouches before it {{is ready to be}} chewed. The partially worn molars of middle-aged koalas are optimal for breaking the leaves into small particles, resulting in more efficient stomach digestion and nutrient absorption in the small intestine, which digests the eucalyptus leaves to provide most of the animal's energy. A koala sometimes regurgitates the food into the mouth to be chewed a second time.|$|E

5000|$|Streptanthus {{gracilis}} is {{an annual}} herb producing a slender, hairless, waxy stem up to 30 or 35 centimeters tall.

40|$|Variation in {{vulnerability}} to xylem cavitation was measured within individual organs of Populus balsamifera L. and Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn. Cavitation was quantified by three different techniques: (a) measuring acoustic emissions, (b) measuring loss of hydraulic conductance while air-dehydrating a branch, and (c) measuring loss of hydraulic conductance {{as a function}} of positive air pressure injected into the xylem. All of these techniques gave similar results. In Populus, <b>petioles</b> were more resistant than branches, and branches were more resistant than roots. This corresponded to the pattern of vessel width: maximum vessel diameter in 1 - to 2 -year-old roots was 140 [mu]m, compared to 65 and 45 [mu]m in rapidly growing 1 -year-old shoots and <b>petioles,</b> respectively. Cavitation in Populus <b>petioles</b> started at a threshold water potential of - 1. 1 MPa. The lowest leaf water potential observed was - 0. 9 MPa. In Alnus, there was no relationship between vessel diameter and the cavitation response of a plant organ. Although conduits were narrower in <b>petioles</b> than in branches, <b>petioles</b> were more vulnerable to cavitation. Cavitation in <b>petioles</b> was detected when water potential fell below - 1. 2 MPa. This value equaled midday leaf water potential in late June. As in Populus, roots were the most vulnerable organ. The significance of different cavitation thresholds in individual plant organs is discussed...|$|R
5|$|The {{predominant}} metallic colour is green, but {{can vary}} by region, ranging from metallic green to purple. In the Flinders Ranges of South Australia and Alice Springs, the colour of the ants shifts from the typical green {{to a dark}} purple colour. In areas with more rainfall such as the New South Wales tablelands and Victorian savannahs, green-head ants are mostly green with purplish tints seen {{on the sides of}} the mesosoma. In the northern regions of New South Wales and Queensland, the alitrunk is reddish-violet, which shades into golden around the lower portions of the pleura. The green colour is either limited or completely absent in this case. Most populations have a bright green gaster, except for those living in the central desert. In some areas examined near Brisbane, two different colour forms were discovered within a single colony. One possibility is that the two colour forms may represent two sibling species, but this cannot be confirmed because of lack of evidence. In far north Queensland, populations appear to be dull green and distinct to those living in the south, but it is unknown how the ants in the far north and south hook up at the western and southern regions of the Atherton Tableland. With this said, it is unknown if the far north populations are actually a different species. In addition to colour variation, there are morphological differences among populations. For example, the size and shape of the head and <b>petiole,</b> the length of the appendages, and other sculptural details of the body may all vary.|$|E
