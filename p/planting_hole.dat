40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{describe}} the {{spatial distribution of}} rodent damage to maize seedlings in field studies in Morogoro, Tanzania. The distribution of damage was assessed {{at the level of}} the <b>planting</b> <b>hole</b> (with three seeds per <b>planting</b> <b>hole)</b> and {{at the level of the}} maize field (where the assessed units were plots of 10 x 10 planting holes). The most abundant rodent species in the fields were the multimammate rat, Mastomys natalensis. At the <b>planting</b> <b>hole</b> level, damage was fairly regular or random. At the field level, damage to seedlings was clustered irrespective of whether the fields were situated in mosaic or monoculture surroundings, but the clusters were not more concentrated near the edges or the near the centre of the field. We conclude that M. natalensis does not exhibit specific exhaustive searching behaviour when feeding on seeds and seedlings in maize fields and that several local factors determine the distribution of the damage.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A machine {{capable of}} placing <b>planting</b> <b>holes</b> {{for a wide}} variety of {{spacings}} in plastic mulch beds with very little physical reconfiguration was designed and tested. The three-point hitch mounted machine was demonstrated with two horticultural crops which have widely varying within-row and between-row spacing requirements: onions and potatoes. The piercing mechanisms were powered by pneumatic cylinders, and the on-board controls allowed users to adjust the number and spacing of holes. Switches enabled between-row spacing to vary by placing from one to four <b>planting</b> <b>holes</b> across a standard 76 -cm (30 -in.) bed. For the algorithm used, a dial was set to create the within-row spacing between 15 and 61 cm (6 and 24 in.). These control settings and a fixed tractor speed acted as inputs to a microprocessor which calculated hole placement frequency and initiated cylinder activation. The machine has been in use for two planting seasons with promising results. Hole placement accuracy data were collected for both onions and potatoes. The potato tests were performed for a within-row spacing of 30 cm (12 in.) and produced 96 % of the <b>planting</b> <b>holes</b> within 10 % of the target spacing distance. The onion tests were performed for a within-row plant spacing of 15 cm (6 in.) and produced 98 % of the <b>planting</b> <b>holes</b> within 10 % of the target spacing distance.

Acacia farnesiana were transplanted from containers into a permanent landscape using four methods: large <b>planting</b> <b>hole</b> with or without amendments or a small <b>planting</b> <b>hole</b> with or without amendments. The study was repeated on two sites. Three years following transplanting, plant growth such as height and caliper were not affected by the <b>planting</b> <b>hole</b> size or amendments, but differed significantly between sites. Plants that received more irrigation and were planted in a less rocky soil had greater caliper and were taller than those supplied with less irrigation and planted on a more rocky soil. Visual observations one and three years after transplanting indicate that trees that were amended with compost in the backfill had the highest incidence of leaning trunks and sinking crowns (20 % of trees in study or 37 % of those receiving amendments) while of those trees that were not amended only one tree (3 %) was leaning three years after transplanting. Hole size at transplanting had no significant effect on leaning or sinking three years after transplanting.

Three field experiments were carried out at each of two locations (Awassa and Wondogenet, Ethiopia). Expt 1 dealt {{with the effects of}} breaking a seed tuber into different numbers of seed pieces before planting, Expt 2 assessed the effect of the weight of the seed tuber piece and Expt 3 investigated the effect of planting different numbers of seed pieces per <b>planting</b> <b>hole.</b> Cultivar Lofuwa was planted in Awassa, whereas cvar Chankua was planted in Wondogenet. Breaking seed tubers in Expt 1 resulted in more main stems/hill, more tubers and smaller individual tubers. In Wondogenet, the tuber yield also increased. Breaking did not affect the number of stolons/m(2). Expt 2 indicated that when only one seed piece was planted per <b>planting</b> <b>hole,</b> smaller seed pieces gave fewer stems, fewer stolons and fewer tubers/m(2), smaller tubers and lower tuber yields.

Three corm types: whole, halved and quartered corms were used. Suckers were harvested one year after removal of apical buds. After harvest, the suckers were sorted into three size groups: undersized, small and medium to large. The number of suckers produced per plot, from four <b>planting</b> <b>holes,</b> ranged from 40 to 141 depending on the treatments. Halved and quartered mother corms, when transferred to new <b>planting</b> <b>holes</b> three months after removal of apical buds, produced fewer suckers.

The halved corms also gave more medium to large suckers than whole and quartered corms when evaluated across all the propagation methods. An {{increase in the number}} of vigorous suckers from halved corms is possible because of elimination of the strong apical dominance while leaving reasonable portions of the mother corm to sustain initiation, growth and development of suckers.

Visava-se, plantando as mudas desta última forma, facilitar o combate à broca do café pela retirada dos grãos que normalmente caem e ficam presos no centro dos quatro troncos formados pelo sistema comum. Os resultados obtidos, correspondentes ao período de 1951 a 1956, não indicaram diferenças significativas entre as produções dos dois tratamentos. Desta forma, embora o problema do combate à broca do café esteja resolvido com o emprêgo de inseticidas modernos, os resultados dêste ensaio mostram que qualquer um dos sistemas de plantio pode ser adotado no estabelecimento de cafèzais. Individual {{trees in}} coffee {{plantations}} {{established in the}} state of São Paulo usually result from four seedlings that were placed in a square within the <b>planting</b> <b>hole.</b> When the plants begin to bear, this planting system favors the coffee berry-borer infestation because many fruits fall in between the stems of the four plants and are hard to be collected, thus remaining as a food source for the insect between two successive crops. Placing the seedlings in a straight line within the <b>planting</b> <b>hole</b> was thought as a method that would facilitate the harvest and permit the collection of fruits left behind on the trees or near their trunks. An experiment designed to compare this planting method with the usual one was undertaken at the Central Experiment Station, instituto Agronômico, Campinas. The red Bourbon variety of Coffea arabica was used. the seedlings in line were placed 15 cm apart, and at about 30 cm when in a square. A randomized block design with 20 replications for the two treatments was used, each plot comprising a single hole with four seedlings. Yield records were taken for the years 1951 through 1956 (Table 1). The size of the beans was also studied (Table 2).

Todas as plantas receberam apenas adubação orgânica com composto vegetal na proporção de 1, 5 L por cova, exceto as dos tratamentos com 3 L de composto por cova. A parcela principal foi constituída de três fileiras com dez plantas de pimentão (0, 50 x 1, 0 m) e cada subparcela continha três fileiras com cinco plantas. A incidência da podridão-de-Sclerotium foi avaliada duas vezes por semana. A cobertura morta favoreceu significativamente a ocorrência da doença. Nas parcelas com esse tratamento o aumento da intensidade da doença, expressa em área abaixo da curva de progresso da doença (AACPD), foi 35, 5 % maior, em comparação com as parcelas sem cobertura morta. A aplicação de T. harzianum ou o incremento na quantidade de composto (de 1, 5 para 3 L por cova) reduziu a AACPD em 38, 1 % e 37, 5 %, respectivamente. A aplicação de T. harzianum ou o incremento na quantidade de composto, mesmo nos tratamentos com cobertura morta, reduziu significativamente a AACPD em 52, 8 % e em 55, 1 %, respectivamente, em comparação com o tratamento apenas com cobertura morta.

On the other hand, there was an increasing of paddy production from SRI method which reached the production of 3. 014, 51 kg per ha. The increase of production caused the increase of total net income by SRI method Rp. 14. 953. 667, 01 per ha. RCR value of this farming was 1, 76 per ha, which the value of RCR > 1 then this farming was profitable categorized. Keywords: Farming, Paddy, SRI, Income, Efficiency </p...|$|R
40|$|Normally {{vegetable}} seedlings {{receive a}} setback {{when they are}} transplanted. Researchers at the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Centre (AVRDC). in Taiwan, have been looking {{to see how that}} setback can be reduced and establishment speeded up. They found that it takes some time for the small roots of seedlings to find a fertilizer granule which may have been applied to the seedbed before transplanting. In experiments, the researchers saw a tremendous difference when soluble fertilizer was placed in the <b>planting</b> <b>hole</b> at the time of transplanting. However, even better results were obtained if the type of fertilizer was varied to suit the crop. Chinese cabbage, for instance, responds better when a nitrogen solution is applied at transplanting, whereas chillies and tomatoes grow better with a dose of phosphates. In all cases there is good early growth, yields are heavier and the crop is ready for harvest earlier. The amount of fertilizer needed is small. Each seedling receive' in the region of 25 ml of the nitrogen or phosphate solution. It can be squirted into the <b>planting</b> <b>hole</b> before the seedling is planted or watered around i' after planting. Watering cans car be used, but AVRDC are developing a planter that will put a squirt into each hole. The system reduces the total amount of fertilizer used on; crop. AVRDC have found the {{there is no need to}} apply fertilizer to the seedbed, only topdressing are needed. For crop of Chinese cabbage, for example, nitrogen applications can be halved. An added benefit i that there is less leaching of fertilizer, thus reducing pollution of the groundwater.

30|$|The {{study was}} carried out in an area where C. papaya L. (Golden variety) is grown under two {{different}} management regimes (conventional and organic), in Sooretama, in Espírito Santo state, Brazil, between 2012 and 2013. The organic area has quality certifications: in 2004 it obtained the “EUREPGAR Protocol for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables” certificate and in 2009 the organically-farmed area obtained the IBD organic certificate (Inspeções e Certificações Agropecuárias e Alimentícias). Local average annual temperature and precipitation are 22  °C and 700 – 800  mm. The experimental areas have a plain topography and a deep soil classified as moderate type A Dystrophic Yellow Podzolic with a sandy/medium texture. The plantation {{was carried out}} in planting holes (40  ×  40  ×  40  cm 3), with a volume of 64  L, with gaps of 3.0  ×  2.0  m in a simple row system resulting in 1700  plants/ha− 1.

Inoculum density of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Sacc.) was two 14 mm- diameter disks per <b>planting</b> <b>hole</b> taken from 10 day old cultures growing on PDA. Plant performance was based on shoot height and weight; stem diameter; number and weight of tomato fruits. Disease assessment was based on wilt index of shoots and length of discolouration of vascular tissues. Performance of plants grown in NKCP amended and non-amended soils was significantly (p= 0. 05) different (33. 3 - 93. 3 %). Disease severity based on the wilt index (0. 53 - 2. 87) and length of discoloured vascular tissues (7. 4 cm- 25. 62 cm) differed significantly (p= 0. 05) among treatments...|$|E
