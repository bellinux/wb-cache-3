From the front rollers the sliver of fibres passes through a funnel, through the calender rollers and into a can which is placed directly underneath them. The material is now ready for the combing machine.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines how}} experience and missing information affect judgments of tax return <b>preparers.</b> Tax return <b>preparers</b> may often {{be faced with}} the problem of incomplete information, and their responses to this problem may be conditioned by whether or not they recognize information is missing. Based on the Holland et al. 's cognitive theory of induction as applied to tax judgment by Marchant et al., it was hypothesized that experienced tax <b>preparers</b> would correctly classify more items as to their relevance to a specific tax issue than novice tax <b>preparers.</b> Additionally, it was hypothesized that the strength of recommendations of tax <b>preparers</b> who had no relevant information missing would be greater than the strength of recommendations of tax <b>preparers</b> who had relevant information missing and were prompted that information was missing. Lastly, it was hypothesized that prompting that relevant information was missing would have a greater effect on the strength of recommendations of tax return <b>preparers</b> with lesser specific experience than it would on the strength of recommendations of tax return <b>preparers</b> with greater specific experience. The results suggest that experienced tax <b>preparers</b> do recognize the relevance of information to a greater degree than novice tax <b>preparers.</b> There was no significant difference, however, in the strengths of recommendation of tax <b>preparers</b> who had no missing information and those who were prompted that information was missing.

500|$|When Jefferson took office, {{he moved}} {{as quickly as}} {{possible}} to fill his cabinet positions. Although he had asked James Madison to be his Secretary of State, Madison did not arrive in Washington until May 1, 1801, due to illness. In the interim, Jefferson asked Lincoln to act temporarily as Secretary of State, which he did from March 5, 1801, until Madison assumed his duties on May 2. During this time, Lincoln was involved in actions that led to the celebrated Marbury v. Madison case concerning judicial review. In the later days of the John Adams administration, the President issued a large number of commissions, some of which had not been delivered by John Marshall, his Secretary of State, at the time Jefferson assumed office. Jefferson ordered Lincoln (in his capacity as acting Secretary of State), and then Madison (after his assumption of the position) not to deliver these commissions. Some intended recipients of these commissions, William Marbury among them, filed a suit in the United States Supreme Court to compel their delivery. In his role as Attorney General, Lincoln was present at the preliminary hearing on the case, representing Madison. When the case was heard (ironically by a court headed by John Marshall, the <b>preparer</b> of the commissions), Lincoln was called to the stand by Marbury's attorney, former Attorney General Charles Lee. Rather than answer Lee's questions, Lincoln invoked both executive privilege and the Fifth Amendment, requesting the opportunity to consider whether or not to answer the questions. The justices granted him time, but {{made it clear that he}} must either answer the questions or clearly justify his objections to specific written questions. When Lincoln returned the next day, he answered all of the posed questions but one. Asked [...] "hat had been done with the commissions", Lincoln refused to answer directly, only stating that he did not know if Madison ever received them. The opposition press criticized Lincoln for this performance, writing that he [...] "was asked a simple question, but could not answer it until they gave it to him in writing, [...] and then he made out to remember that he had forgot all about it".|$|E

40|$|This article explores {{whether the}} {{attitude}} of <b>preparers</b> towards lobbying to a private accounting standard setter is different depending on the regulatory background of the preparersâ€™ home country. Prior literature examined the preparersâ€™ incentives and preparersâ€™ characteristics as drivers {{to participate in the}} due process of international accounting standard setting, but it did not investigate the impact of the preparersâ€™ national regulatory background on participation. As a result of the acceptance of the International Financial Reporting Standards promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in different countries, <b>preparers</b> who are traditionally accustomed with an accounting standard setting process initiated by governments with few opportunities for formal participation, are now able to participate in a private accounting standard setting process characterized by several possibilities for participation. Comparing survey evidence of Belgian <b>preparers</b> with existing survey evidence of UK <b>preparers,</b> we notice that the participation methods used, the perception on the effectiveness of the participation methods and the reasons for non-participation differ across both groups of <b>preparers.</b> This finding suggests that the national regulatory background of the <b>preparers</b> may affect the behaviour of <b>preparers</b> in their decision to participate in private accounting standard setting. status: publishe...|$|R

2500|$|The {{most common}} {{preparation}} involves a careful {{arrangement of the}} yerba within the gourd before adding hot water. In this method, the gourd is first filled one-half to three-quarters of the way with yerba. Too much yerba {{will result in a}} [...] "short" [...] mate; conversely, too little yerba results in a [...] "long" [...] mate, both being considered undesirable. After that, any additional herbs (yuyo, in Portuguese jujo) may be added for either health or flavor benefits, a practice most common in Paraguay, where people acquire herbs from a local yuyera (herbalist) and use the mate as a base for their herbal infusions. When the gourd is adequately filled, the <b>preparer</b> typically grasps it with the full hand, covering and roughly sealing the opening with the palm. Then the mate is turned upside-down, and shaken vigorously, but briefly and with gradually decreasing force, in this inverted position. This causes the finest, most powdery particles of the yerba to settle toward the preparer's palm and the top of the mate.|$|E
