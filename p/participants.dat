5|$|Falk, Heine, Takemura, Zhang and Hsu {{investigated}} {{the validity of}} implicit self-esteem measures to assess cultural differences. They subjected Canadian and Japanese <b>participants</b> {{to a series of}} tests, one of which was rating the numbers to 40 by how much <b>participants</b> liked them. Because the researchers saw little to no correlation between the various implicit self-esteem measures, they did not draw any conclusions about cultural differences. Stieger and Krizan explored cross-cultural differences in number preferences, specifically the day on which Christmas is celebrated as a contributor to number preference. They asked <b>participants</b> from six countries to rate numbers between 1 and 36. They found that in countries where gifts are exchanged on 24 December <b>participants</b> disproportionately preferred the number 24, whereas in countries that do this on 25 December <b>participants</b> preferred 25. They concluded that cultural influences need {{to be taken into account}} if these preferences are used to reflect individual differences.|$|E
5|$|In a 2013 study, Yule et al. {{looked into}} mental health variances between Caucasian heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, and asexuals. The results of 203 male and 603 female <b>participants</b> were {{included}} in the findings. Yule et al. found that asexual male <b>participants</b> {{were more likely to report}} having a mood disorder than other males, particularly in comparison to the heterosexual <b>participants.</b> The same was found for female asexual <b>participants</b> over their heterosexual counterparts; however, non-asexual, non-heterosexual females had the highest rates. Asexual <b>participants</b> of both sexes were more likely to have anxiety disorders than heterosexual and non-heterosexual <b>participants,</b> as were they more likely than heterosexual <b>participants</b> to report having had recent suicidal feelings. Yule et al. hypothesised that some of these differences may be due to discrimination and other societal factors.|$|E
5|$|Many {{language}} studies, {{particularly in}} fMRI, use the subtraction paradigm, in which brain activation in a task thought to involve {{some aspect of}} language processing is compared against activation in a baseline task thought to involve similar non-linguistic processes but not to involve the linguistic process. For example, activations while <b>participants</b> read words may be compared to baseline activations while <b>participants</b> read strings of random letters (in attempt to isolate activation related to lexical processingthe processing of real words), or activations while <b>participants</b> read syntactically complex sentences may be compared to baseline activations while <b>participants</b> read simpler sentences.|$|E

Results of the data analysis indicated that the hypothesis was not supported: the <b>participant’s</b> syntactic performance exhibited no presence of code-switching.
