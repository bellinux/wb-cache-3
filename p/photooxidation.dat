5|$|The {{most common}} {{molecules}} attacked by oxidation are unsaturated fats; oxidation {{causes them to}} turn rancid. Since oxidized lipids are often discolored and usually have unpleasant tastes such as metallic or sulfurous flavors, {{it is important to}} avoid oxidation in fat-rich foods. Thus, these foods are rarely preserved by drying; instead, they are preserved by smoking, salting or fermenting. Even less fatty foods such as fruits are sprayed with sulfurous antioxidants prior to air drying. Oxidation is often catalyzed by metals, which is why fats such as butter should never be wrapped in aluminium foil or kept in metal containers. Some fatty foods such as olive oil are partially protected from oxidation by their natural content of antioxidants, but remain sensitive to <b>photooxidation.</b> Antioxidant preservatives are also added to fat based cosmetics such as lipstick and moisturizers to prevent rancidity.|$|E

The major mechanisms whereby carotenoids prevent harmful <b>photooxidations</b> in vitro and their suggested protective function in photosynthetic tissue, i. e. chioroplasts, will be summarized briefly.

40|$|ABSTRACT. - A {{review is}} {{presented}} of the photochemistry of porphyrin complexes {{of the first}} row transition metals, particularly those of chromium, manganese, and iron. Their photochemistry has revealed a diverse set of reactions, including oxygen and nitrogen atom transfers, photoreductions, <b>photooxidations,</b> photocatalysis, and radical chain initiations. There is growing evidence that much of this diversity actually represents secondary thermal reac-tions. In many cases, the primary photoprocess is homolytic loss of an axial ligand, resulting in photoreduction of the metal and production of a reactive radical from the lost ligand. Subsequent fast thermal reactions can then lead {{to the formation of}} the wide range of reactivity observed. This observation is consistent with the nature of the exci-ted states involved. Irradiation of the low energy x + K transitions does not produce photochemical reactions, and the observed photochemistry does not come from the lowest available excited state. Instead, the metalloporphyrin excited states that show photochemistry are those involved in charge transfer transitions, either from the axial li-gand to the metal or from the porphyrin itself to the metal. Thus, the preponderance of metalloporphyrin photoche-mistry is observed in complexes with hyper spectra...|$|R

40|$|Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of vinyl-terminated 3 - and 8 -carbon {{compounds}} {{were generated}} on Si substrates and reacted {{at room temperature}} with approximately 1 ppm gaseous O(3). A combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) was used to study the surface composition and morphology after oxidation. A distribution of large (approximately 0. 1 - 10 microm) organic aggregates was formed, while the surrounding substrate became depleted of carbon compared to the unreacted SAM. This highly unusual result establishes that the mechanism of ozonolysis of alkene SAMs must have a channel that is unique compared {{to that in the}} gas phase or in solution, and may involve polymerization induced by the Criegee intermediate (CI).

The uptake of water, measured using transmission FTIR, was not increased upon oxidation of these films. In conjunction with literature reports of polymer formation from VOC-NO(x) <b>photooxidations,</b> these results suggest that formation of aggregates and polymers in the atmosphere is much more widespread than previously thought.

The bacteria were found in a high proportion (10 to 30 %) of the total heterotrophic bacterial strains isolated from marine algae, seagrasses, stromatolites, the epiphytes on stromatolites, seawater, and sands; in some cases they constituted up to 49 % of the total. This is much higher than the previous report of 6 % from Japan. A high percentage, 13 %, was also found in the seawater of Hamelin Pool, at Shark Bay, where the salinity was 66 %.

40|$|Seventeen {{airborne}} carbonyls including monocarbonyls and dicarbonyls {{were determined}} in urban and sub-urban sites of Xi'an, China in three seasons in 2010. In winter, acetone {{was the most}} abundant carbonyl in the urban site due to usage of organic solvents in constructions and laboratories and its slower atmospheric removal mechanisms by photolysis and reaction with hydroxyl radical than those of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. In the sub-urban site, acetaldehyde was the most abundant carbonyl, followed by formaldehyde and acetone. During summer, however, formaldehyde was the most dominant carbonyl in both sites. The <b>photooxidations</b> {{of a wide range}} of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) yielded much more formaldehyde than other carbonyls under high solar radiation and temperature. In the urban site, the average concentrations of dicarbonyls (i. e.; glyoxal and methyglyoxal) in spring and summer were higher than that in winter. Transformation of aromatic VOCs emitted from fuel evaporation leads to the formation of 1, 2 -dicarbonyls. A reverse trend was observed in sub-urban sites, as explained by the relatively low abundances and accumulations of VOC precursors in the rural atmosphere during warm seasons. Moreover, cumulative cancer risk based on measured outdoor carbonyls (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) in Xi'an Jiaotong University and Heihe was estimated (8. 82 × 10 - 5 and 4. 96 × 10 - 5, respectively).

40|$|The {{herbicide}} SAN 9789 (4 -chloro- 5 -(methylamino) - 2 -(α,α,α-trifluoro-m-tolyl- 3 - (2 H) pyridazinone) blocks carotenoid synthesis {{in growing}} and resting cells of Euglena at concentrations of 20 to 100 μg/ml without affecting cell viability. Although the inhibition is immediate and complete, in resting cells no decrease in already synthesized carotenoids is found indicating {{a lack of}} turnover. In cells growing in the dark, carotenoids are diluted out as the cells divide. Cells dividing in {{the light in the}} presence of SAN 9789, eventually lose viability, presumably because of <b>photooxidations</b> usually prevented by carotenoids. During 72 hours of light-induced plastid development in dark-grown resting cells, none of the usual carotenoids increase while phytoene accumulates, indicating that SAN 9789 blocks carotenoid synthesis at this point. Chlorophyll synthesis and membrane formation are also blocked by the herbicide, but these inhibitions appear to be secondary to the inhibition of carotenoid synthesis. That carotenoid levels are strongly correlated with and may control the synthesis of chlorophyll and the formation of plastid membranes is suggested by the following data. (a) If dark-grown dividing cells are placed {{in the presence of the}} herbicide for various periods, rested and exposed to light in the presence of the drug, different amounts of carotenoids remain in the cells and the amount of chlorophyll finally synthesized is proportional to the amount of carotenoids present. (b) Photodestruction of chlorophyll is excluded, since the same amounts of chlorophyll are formed at intensities of 10 to 100 foot-candles of light. (c) Photoconversion of protochlorophyll(ide) to chlorophyll(ide) in dark-grown cells is not blocked by the herbicide. (d) Initial rates of chlorophyll synthesis are the same in treated and nontreated cells.

Mutations were designed to test various structural and functional properties of cytochrome c₂ such as redox potential (Y 75 C, Y 75 F and Y 75 S), surface charges (K 12 D, K 14 E, K 32 E and K 14 E/K 32 E), and protein conformation (P 35 A and W 67 Y). All R. capsulatus cytochrome c₂ mutants, except Y 75 C and Y 75 S, were overproduced in both R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides suggesting that these mutations had no effects on heme attachment and protein stability. Furthermore, all R. capsulatus cytochrome c₂ mutants transcomplement for photosynthetic growth a cytochrome c₂ minus mutant of R. sphaeroides suggesting that these mutations function in vivo. Analysis of the spectroscopic, redox potential, kinetic and stability properties of mutants Y 75 C and Y 75 F suggested that R. capsulatus tyrosine 75 or its equivalent in other species plays an important role in formation of a hydrogen bonding network which results in maintaining redox potentials and stability of cytochromes c in general. It was found that the charge mutants exhibited small reductions in redox potentials that were consistent with the substitution of positively charged groups with negatively charged groups. Kinetic analyses of the charge mutant <b>photooxidations</b> by R. sphaeroides reaction centers suggested that the lysine groups surrounding the cytochrome c exposed heme edge are not critical to cytochrome c structure and function but play a role in optimal molecular orientation for electron transfer reactions. In addition, denaturation studies of the charge mutants indicated that lysine groups in the amino terminal alpha helix may be important to cytochrome c₂ stability. Analysis of the spectroscopic, redox potential, kinetic and stability properties of mutants P 35 A and W 67 Y suggested that proline 35 and tryptophan 67 of R. capsulatus cytochrome c₂ or their equivalents in other species are important to stability but not critical to the structure, redox potential, and function of cytochromes c in general...|$|R
