When composed with perspective projection, this scheme also finds application in the tolerance problem arising from computer aided manufacturing. 1 Introduction This technical report furnishes the mathematical results of our investigations on the classical <b>polar</b> <b>set</b> transfor [...] ...|$|E

Our results extend the analogous one-dimensional results of M. Beiglböck and N. Juillet (2016) and M. Beiglböck, M. Nutz, and N. Touzi (2015).
