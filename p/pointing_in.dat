5|$|The {{streams of}} dust and gas each form their own {{distinct}} tail, <b>pointing</b> <b>in</b> slightly different directions. The tail of dust is {{left behind in the}} comet's orbit in such a manner that it often forms a curved tail called the type II or dust tail. At the same time, the ion or type I tail, made of gases, always points directly away from the Sun because this gas is more strongly affected by the solar wind than is dust, following magnetic field lines rather than an orbital trajectory. On occasions - such as when the Earth passes through a comet's orbital plane, a tail <b>pointing</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction to the ion and dust tails called the antitail may be seen.|$|E

5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} leading edge of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as {{the leading edge of the}} isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to twice as fast as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) <b>pointing</b> <b>in</b> the direction of travel, {{at the leading edge}} of the cooler air mass.|$|E
5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving boundary between two different air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain in the same area for long periods of time, usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherms. A wide variety of weather can be found along a {{stationary front}}, but usually clouds and prolonged precipitation are found there. Stationary fronts will either dissipate after several days or devolve into shear lines, but can change into a cold or warm front if conditions aloft change causing a driving of one air mass or the other. Stationary fronts are marked on weather maps with alternating red half-circles and blue spikes <b>pointing</b> <b>in</b> opposite directions, indicating no significant movement.|$|E

5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles <b>pointing</b> <b>in</b> direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E
5|$|Some of Mighty Jill Offs {{gameplay}} is {{borrowed from}} the 1986 arcade game Mighty Bomb Jack as a tribute. Players control Jill in only three ways: moving, jumping, and slowly descending. In the air, players may cause Jill to slowly descend by rapidly pushing the jump button while <b>pointing</b> <b>in</b> the direction that they want her to go. Players can switch direction while they do this. There are three types of obstacles: spikes, fire, and spiders; the latter can move to attack Jill when she comes close. Coming into contact with these obstacles kills Jill instantly, forcing her {{to start at the}} most recent checkpoint—typically located at a change in room. There is only one level in the game, but with several rooms in it. The screen scrolls vertically with Jill as she ascends up the tower. Each room transition is demonstrated by a change in the room's background colour. Jill has infinite lives, allowing players to play as long as they like without having to start the game over.|$|E
