50|$|The main {{drawback}} {{of pressure}} transfer, is that transfer can be slow {{due to the}} small pressure difference between donating and receiving flasks. Inert gas lines are usually vented out of a gas bubbler placed in-line to prevent overpressure. The vents need to be isolated by capping the bubbler outlet, or stopping the egress of inert gas with a stopcock or <b>pinch</b> <b>clamp,</b> to ensure sufficient pressure to complete the transfer. The use of a mercury bubbler instead of one filled with oil used to be popular, but is out of favor due to the difficulty in dealing with mercury spills.|$|E
40|$|Initial {{clinical}} {{results with}} the LifeSite ® Hemodialysis Access System. BackgroundThe LifeSite® Hemodialysis Access System is a subcutaneous valve with an internal <b>pinch</b> <b>clamp</b> that is actuated {{with a standard}} 14 -gauge dialysis needle, connected to a single lumen cannula placed in the central venous circulation for hemodialysis (HD). MethodsThe LifeSite System (2 valves) was implanted in 23 patients with immediate dual-needle HD use. The cannulas were placed in either the jugular or the subclavian veins and were connected to the subcutaneous valves located in the upper chest area. ResultsThe mean duration of device survival for the LifeSite System was 6. 8 ± 0. 97 months. During this period, the device achieved prescription HD blood flow rates averaging 384. 7 ± 78. 5 mL/min with a venous pressure of 223. 2 ± 60. 3 mm Hg. After 125 patient months, device removal because of infection was {{at a rate of}} 2. 5 per 1000 days, and there were no devices removed because of poor flow. The average Kt/V for these patients was 1. 51. ConclusionThis preliminary clinical study has validated the applicability of the LifeSite® Hemodialysis Access System as an access for HD. It is easily implanted and easily used, provides safe and effective dialysis, and is well accepted by patients. It should be especially useful as a bridge device to allow for maturation of a native fistula and will provide an alternative for long-term use in patients in whom a peripheral dialysis access is not feasible...|$|E

Intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid may potentially meet the need for effective, minimally invasive intervention in patients not responding adequately to initial treatment. We aimed to confirm the safety and effectiveness of viscosupplementation with Durolane (NASHA nonanimal hyaluronic acid) in rhizarthrosis. Patients and methods: This was a prospective, single-arm, multicenter, open-label study with a 6 -month follow-up period. Eligible patients had Eaton–Littler grade II–III rhizarthrosis in one TMC joint with pain and visual analog scale (VAS) pain score ≥ 4 (scale: 0 – 10). A single injection of NASHA was administered to the affected TMC joint. The primary effectiveness variable was change from baseline in VAS pain score. Results: Thirty-five patients (mean age 60. 8 years; 85. 7 % female) received NASHA and completed the study. The least-squares mean change from baseline in VAS pain score over 6  months was – 2. 00, a reduction of 27. 8 % (p< 0. 001). The reduction in pain exceeded 25 % as early as month 1 (26. 5 %), and gradual improvement was observed throughout the 6 -month follow-up period. Secondary effectiveness parameters included QuickDASH (shortened version of Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand [DASH]), Kapandji thumb opposition test, radial abduction, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint flexion, and <b>pinch</b> (<b>clamp)</b> strength. Most of these measurements showed statistically significant improvements from baseline over 6 months. Five adverse events (injection site reactions) were reported in four patients (11. 4 %), and there were no serious or allergic reactions. Conclusion: This study suggests that viscosupplementation using NASHA is effective and well tolerated in treating the symptoms of rhizarthrosis.

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) signals generate chaotic strange attractors and the shape of these attractors correlate with depth of anesthesia. We applied chaos analysis to frontal cortical and hippocampal micro-EEG signals from implanted microelectrodes (layer 4 and CA 1, respectively). Rats were taken to and from loss of righting reflex (LORR) with isoflurane and behavioral measures were compared to attractor shape. Resting EEG signals at LORR differed markedly from awake signals, more similar to slow wave sleep signals, and easily discerned in raw recordings (high amplitude slow waves), and in fast Fourier transform analysis (FFT; increased delta power), in good agreement with previous studies. EEG activation stimulated by turning rats on their side, to test righting, produced signals quite similar to awake resting state EEG signals. That is, the high amplitude slow wave activity changed to low amplitude fast activity that lasted for several seconds, before returning to slow wave activity. This occurred regardless of whether the rat was able to right itself, or not. Testing paw <b>pinch</b> and tail <b>clamp</b> responses produced similar EEG activations, even from deep anesthesia when burst suppression dominated the spontaneous EEG. Chaotic attractor shape was far better at discerning between these awake-like signals, at loss of responses, than was FFT analysis. Comparisons are provided between FFT and chaos analysis of EEG during awake walking, slow wave sleep, and isoflurane-induced effects at several depths of anesthesia. Attractors readily discriminated between natural sleep and isoflurane-induced ‘delta’ activity. Chaotic attractor shapes changed gradually through the transition from awake to LORR, indicating that this was not an on/off like transition, but rather a point along a continuum of brain states...|$|R
