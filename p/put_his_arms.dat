5|$|Blythe, who is nearsighted, {{took off}} his glasses before {{entering}} the stage, which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half-blind. Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage. One of the fans, who was identified as Milan Pořádek by Czech newspapers, and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings, managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security. Blythe testified that during the first attempt, Pořádek rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving. The second time, he tried to <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> around Blythe {{in an attempt to}} hug him. Blythe, who according to his own words perceived this as a danger, caught Pořádek's collar, pushed him on the ground, knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop. He then led the fan by his hair {{to the edge of the}} stage, where the fan jumped off. It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back. Blythe further said that he saw Pořádek trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security.|$|E
500|$|Mia Farrow, who {{had come}} and gone from the ashram before, left again and drifted around India before {{returning}} to the United States. Geoffrey Giuliano in Revolver: The Secret History of the Beatles says that, before leaving, she told the Beatles that the Maharishi had made a pass at her. Ned Wynn, one of Farrow's childhood friends, wrote in his 1990 memoir that she had told him in the early 1970s that the Maharishi had definitely made sexual passes at her. In her 1993 autobiography, Cooke de Herrera wrote that Farrow had confided to her, before the arrival of the Beatles, that the Maharishi had made a pass during a private puja ceremony by stroking her hair. Cooke de Herrera wrote that she told Farrow that she had misinterpreted the Maharishi's actions. Farrow's 1997 memoirs are ambiguous, describing an encounter with the Maharishi in his private meditation [...] "cave" [...] when he tried to <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> around her. She reports that her sister Prudence told her that it was [...] "an honour" [...] and [...] "a tradition" [...] for a [...] "holy man" [...] to touch someone after meditation.|$|E
500|$|She was {{particularly}} affectionate towards the latter because it {{allowed her to}} appear on camera with her two children, {{and said it was}} her favorite. Certain elements of Rand's characterization were developed by Whitney and Shatner; Whitney would go to Shatner's side when their characters were put in danger – in response, Shatner would <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> around her, such as in [...] "Balance of Terror". The character was written out of the episode [...] "Dagger of the Mind", which Whitney attributed to the romantic liaison that Kirk has with the female lead in that episode being so overt that it would have caused issues for later plots. This was because the script had Kirk and the female lead sleep with each other. Although Whitney found it difficult to watch as her character had been removed from the episode, she understood why. Part of her outfit was dictated by attempting to increase the duties of the Captain's Yeoman on screen. In order to provide support while part of an away team on a planet, Roddenberry suggested that she could wear a device on an over-the-shoulder strap which she could use as an electronic camera. He also suggested immediately that it could be expanded in order to be sold as a toy for young girls. This was part of the development process that {{led to the creation of}} the tricorder.|$|E

2500|$|Years later, Crystal {{appeared}} on Inside the Actors Studio and fondly recalled that, after the Oscar ceremony, Palance approached {{him during the}} reception: [...] "He stopped me and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> out and went, 'Billy Crystal, who {{thought it would be}} you?' It was his really funny way of saying thank you to a little New York Jewy guy who got him the Oscars." ...|$|E
2500|$|Linda and Noor {{were sitting}} on a {{two-seater}} couch with Charlotte sitting on the arm, when Noor started touching Linda in a sexual way. He spoke into her ear, <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> around her waist and refused to let her go. Kathleen then started screaming at him and a verbal altercation took place where Kathleen Mulhall was alleged to have instructed them to ”just kill him for me" [...] Charlotte picked up a Stanley knife and struck Noor across the throat, inflicting a wound that {{sent him to the}} ground. Linda then picked up a hammer and hit him on the head a number of times. Their mother looked on but didn't participate. Noor was stabbed at least 27 times. It may have been more, but pathologists had no opportunity to examine the full body.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a drunken}} revelry, some of Curly Bill's friends were firing pistols {{into the air}} on October 27, 1880, [...] in a dark vacant lot between Toughnut and Allen Streets, near where the Birdcage Theater now stands. Tombstone's Town Marshal Fred White {{attempted}} to disarm Brocius and grabbed his weapon by the barrel. The gun discharged, striking White in the groin. Wyatt Earp had borrowed Fred Dodge's pistol and he pistol-whipped Brocius. At the preliminary hearing for Brocius afterward, Wyatt testified {{that he had heard}} White say: [...] "I am an officer; give me your pistol.” When he got close, he saw Brocius remove his pistol from his scabbard and White grab it by the barrel. He said he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> around Brocius from behind to see if he had any other weapons, and White [...] "gave a quick jerk and the pistol went off." [...] White fell to the ground, wounded. When the pistol discharged, Wyatt buffaloed Brocius and arrested him. Brocius complained, [...] "What have I done? I have not done anything to be arrested for.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Ned and Dan, {{and friends}} Joe Byrne and Steve Hart, {{went to the}} police camp and told them to [...] Constable McIntyre <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> up, but Lonigan tried to run for cover. Ned Kelly shot him dead as Lonigan turned his head back toward Kelly as he ran. When the other two police came back to camp, McIntyre told them to surrender. Scanlan was trying to {{dismount}} when he saw the attackers and tried to swing his rifle around but Ned shot him dead. Kennedy jumped behind his horse and ran shooting from tree to tree with Ned chasing him. During the shooting, Kennedy was wounded. Ned shot him in the chest when he tried to surrender some 800 yards away from the camp. [...] Then he lined him up and then shot him through the chest at point blank range. McIntyre was able to escape during the [...] It was later reported in the newspapers that it was Dan who had shot Kennedy. Dan was wounded during the shooting.|$|E
2500|$|Groucho {{maintained}} his irrepressible {{sense of humor}} to the very end, however. [...] George Fenneman, his radio and TV announcer, good-natured foil, and lifelong friend, often related a story {{of one of his}} final visits to Groucho's home: When the time came to end the visit, Fenneman lifted Groucho from his wheelchair, <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> around his torso, and began to [...] "walk" [...] the frail comedian backwards across the room towards his bed. As he did, he heard a weak voice in his ear: [...] "Fenneman," [...] whispered Groucho, [...] "you always were a lousy dancer." [...] When a nurse approached him with a thermometer during his final hospitalization, explaining that she wanted to see if he had a temperature, he responded, [...] "Don't be silly—everybody has a temperature." [...] Actor Elliott Gould recalled a similar incident: [...] "I recall the last time I saw Groucho, he was in the hospital, and he had tubes in his nose and what have you," [...] he said. [...] "And when he saw me, he was weak, but he was there; and he put his fingers on the tubes and played them like it was a clarinet. Groucho played the tubes for me, which brings me to tears." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 26, 2011 (Australia Day), Buffett was {{performing}} {{a concert in}} Australia at Sydney's Hordern Pavilion and fell off the stage after an encore. A concert-goer said, [...] "He just {{went over to the}} edge of the stage, like he had numerous times through the night, just to wave, and people were throwing stuffed toys and things at him. And he just took one step too many and just disappeared in a flash. He didn't have time to <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> out to save himself or anything, he just dropped." [...] Coincidentally, one of Australia's leading trauma surgeons was at the concert and close to the stage; Dr. Gordian Fulde treated Buffett at the scene. Fulde said, [...] "I thought he'd broken his neck.... I heard the clunk of his head on a metal ledge, he has a deep gash on his scalp, which is all right now.... But at first I thought: this guy is going to be a spinal injury." [...] Dr Fulde turned him on his side so he could breathe and administered first aid. Buffett regained consciousness within a few minutes. He was then transported to St Vincent's Hospital Emergency centre for treatment and was released the next day. Buffett returned to Australia in 2012 for two shows in Brisbane and Melbourne, and made much fun of the incident during those shows. In the Melbourne show in the historic Palais Theatre in the Melbourne beachside suburb of St. Kilda he presented additional verses of [...] "Margaritaville" [...] in which he made humorous references to the accident, much to the audience's delight.|$|E

60|$|He {{wanted to}} <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> round her. If he could <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> round her, and draw her against {{him as they}} walked, he would equilibriate himself.
