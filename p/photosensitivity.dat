5|$|The <b>photosensitivity</b> of {{the silver}} halides allowed for their use in {{traditional}} photography, although digital photography, which does not use silver, is now dominant. The photosensitive emulsion used in black-and-white photography is a suspension of silver halide crystals in gelatin, possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved <b>photosensitivity,</b> developing, and tuning. Colour photography requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers, so that the initial black-and-white silver image couples with a different dye component. The original silver images are bleached off and the silver is then recovered and recycled. Silver nitrate is the starting material in all cases.|$|E
5|$|Side effects include {{increased}} skin <b>photosensitivity,</b> dryness, redness {{and occasional}} peeling. Sunscreen use is often advised during treatment, to prevent sunburn. Lower concentrations of benzoyl peroxide {{are just as}} effective as higher concentrations in treating acne but are associated with fewer side effects. Unlike antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide {{does not appear to}} generate bacterial antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|Silver fulminate, AgCNO, a powerful, touch-sensitive {{explosive}} used in percussion caps, {{is made by}} {{reaction of}} silver metal with nitric acid {{in the presence of}} ethanol. Other dangerously explosive silver compounds are silver azide, AgN3, formed by reaction of silver nitrate with sodium azide, and silver acetylide, Ag2C2, formed when silver reacts with acetylene gas in ammonia solution. In its most characteristic reaction, silver azide decomposes explosively, releasing nitrogen gas: given the <b>photosensitivity</b> of silver salts, this behaviour may be induced by shining a light on its crystals.|$|E
25|$|Type I <b>Photosensitivity</b> {{occurs when}} the {{photodynamic}} compounds need not undergo metabolism to be activated and so may accumulate under the skin directly following ingestion. Examples of plants producing Type I <b>Photosensitivity</b> include Buckwheat and St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum). Certain drugs such as phenothiazine or its derivatives may also lead to <b>photosensitivity</b> reactions, commonly in sheep. Phenothiazine is converted by the body into the photodynamic compound phenothiazine sulfoxide.|$|E
25|$|Oral β-carotene is {{prescribed}} to {{people suffering from}} erythropoietic protoporphyria. It provides them some relief from <b>photosensitivity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Type IV <b>Photosensitivity</b> occurs {{following}} the ingestion of certain plants, such as alfalfa. The reason is obscure or idiopathic.|$|E
25|$|<b>Photosensitivity</b> (exposure to {{ultraviolet}} light causes rash, or other symptoms of SLE flareups); sensitivity = 43%; specificity = 96%.|$|E
25|$|Skin reactions: Rash, pruritus, and <b>photosensitivity</b> {{have all}} been noticed. Toxic {{epidermal}} necrolysis (Lyell's syndrome) may also be encountered and may be life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|<b>Photosensitivity</b> is an {{abnormal}} skin reaction to direct sunlight exposure. It is unrelated to a sunburn. These reactions {{are due to}} photosensitization, the accumulation of photosensitive compounds beneath the skin. In some cases, the photodynamic substances come from ingested plants or drugs, after being metabolized or not. In other cases, the photodynamic substances may be produced in the body itself due to inborn errors in pigment metabolism, especially those involving the heme synthesis. <b>Photosensitivity</b> reactions are usually seen in herbivorous or omnivorous animals, though such reactions are not uncommon among carnivores.|$|E
25|$|Most XP-F {{patients}} show moderate {{symptoms of}} XP, {{but a few}} show additional symptoms of Cockayne syndrome. Cockayne syndrome (CS) patients exhibit <b>photosensitivity,</b> and also exhibit developmental defects and neurological symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Other {{symptoms}} include scaly skin, abnormalities of the fingernails and toenails, clouding {{of the lens}} of the eye from birth (congenital cataracts), poor co-ordination, and ocular and skeletal abnormalities. Half of affected individuals also experience <b>photosensitivity</b> to UV light.|$|E
25|$|The common, adverse drug {{reactions}} (side effects) are {{the same}} as with other PDE5 inhibitors. The frequent vardenafil-specific side-effect is nausea; the infrequent side effects are abdominal pain, back pain, <b>photosensitivity,</b> abnormal vision, eye pain, facial edema, hypotension, palpitation, tachycardia, arthralgia, myalgia, rash, itch, and priapism.|$|E
25|$|Hormonal {{fluctuations}} {{that contribute}} to cyclical attacks in women have been treated with oral contraceptives and luteinizing hormones to shut down menstrual cycles. However, oral contraceptives have also triggered <b>photosensitivity</b> and withdrawal of oral contraceptives has triggered attacks. Androgens and fertility hormones have also triggered attacks.|$|E
25|$|Immediate <b>photosensitivity.</b> This {{is typical}} of XLDPP and EPP. Following a {{variable}} period of sun exposure—typically about 30 minutes—patients complain of severe pain, burning, and discomfort in exposed areas. Typically, the effects are not visible, though occasionally {{there may be some}} redness and swelling of the skin.|$|E
25|$|Prurigo nodularis. Prurigo nodularis {{has been}} {{identified}} with coeliac disease. Rothmund-Thomson syndrome. Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, or , is a rare disorder, generally attributed to mutations of the RECQL4 helicase gene on 8q24 with features that include <b>photosensitivity</b> and poikilodermatous skin changes, etc., and {{has been reported in}} one celiac patient.|$|E
25|$|Although {{photographic}} processes {{have been}} in development since the mid-1800s, there were no suitable theoretical explanations until 1938 {{with the publication of}} a paper by R.W. Gurney and N.F. Mott. This paper triggered a large amount of research in fields of solid-state chemistry and physics, as well more specifically in silver halide <b>photosensitivity</b> phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Some {{individuals}} with the rare inherited syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum have mutations in ERCC4. These patients {{are classified as}} XP complementation group F (XP-F). Diagnostic features of XP are dry scaly skin, abnormal skin pigmentation in sun-exposed areas and severe <b>photosensitivity,</b> accompanied by a great than 1000-fold increased risk of developing UV radiation-induced skin cancers.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{historians have}} theorized {{that people with}} {{porphyria}} (a disease that shares many symptoms with SLE) generated folklore stories of vampires and werewolves, due to the <b>photosensitivity,</b> scarring, hair growth, and porphyrin brownish-red stained teeth in severe recessive forms of porphyria (or combinations of the disorder, known as dual, homozygous, or compound heterozygous porphyrias).|$|E
25|$|An {{erythematous}} rash in sun-exposed {{parts of}} the body has been reported to occur in 7.3–21.2% of persons taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis. One study examined the tolerability of various malaria prophylactic regimens and found doxycycline did not cause a significantly higher percentage of all skin events (<b>photosensitivity</b> not specified) when compared with other antimalarials. The rash resolves upon discontinuation of the drug.|$|E
25|$|<b>Photosensitivity</b> {{reactions}} {{are characterized by}} severe {{inflammation of the skin}} with depigmentation and ulceration. In some cases (Type I), pigments are excreted through urine or deposited in hard tissues such as bones and teeth, causing discolouration. Affected animals should be protected from direct sunlight until the photodynamic compounds have been completely eliminated from the body or the appropriate treatments have been given.|$|E
25|$|The rarest is {{congenital}} {{erythropoietic porphyria}} (C.E.P.), otherwise known as Gunther's disease. The signs may present from birth and include severe <b>photosensitivity,</b> brown teeth that fluoresce in ultraviolet light due to deposition of Type 1 porphyrins, and later hypertrichosis. Hemolytic anemia usually develops. Pharmaceutical-grade beta carotene {{may be used in}} its treatment. A bone marrow transplant has also been successful in curing CEP in a few cases, although long-term results are not yet available.|$|E
25|$|Paradoxically yet uncommonly, {{indometacin}} {{can cause}} headache (10 to 20%), sometimes with vertigo and dizziness, hearing loss, tinnitus, blurred vision (with or without retinal damage). There are unsubstantiated reports of worsening Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and psychiatric disorders. Cases of life-threatening shock (including angioedema, sweating, severe hypotension and tachycardia {{as well as}} acute bronchospasm), severe or lethal hepatitis and severe bone marrow damage have all been reported. Skin reactions and <b>photosensitivity</b> are also possible side effects.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with CS appear prematurely {{aged and}} exhibit severe growth {{retardation}} leading to short stature. They {{have a small}} head (less than the -3 standard deviation), fail to gain weight and failure to thrive. They also have extreme cutaneous <b>photosensitivity</b> (sensitivity to sunlight), neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and deafness, and often exhibit lipoatrophy, atrophic skin, severe tooth decay, sparse hair, calcium deposits in neurons, cataracts, sensorineural hearing loss, pigmentary retinopathy, and bone abnormalities. However, {{they do not have}} a higher risk of cancer.|$|E
25|$|Type II <b>Photosensitivity</b> {{is caused}} by inborn errors in the {{metabolism}} of certain biological pigments. In the absence of some key metabolic enzymes, the products of intermediary metabolism accumulate. They are either eliminated through the urine and body fluids or are deposited in some body tissue, such as bone and teeth. A common condition seen in animals is congenital porphyria due to the accumulation of Uroporphyrin, which is deposited in the teeth and bones, giving them a pink discolouration, or excreted through the urine, exhibiting a pinkish fluorescence under ultraviolet light.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} of {{citalopram}} include drowsiness, insomnia, nausea, weight changes (usually weight gain), increase in appetite, vivid dreaming, frequent urination, decreased sex drive, anorgasmia, dry mouth, increased sweating, trembling, diarrhea, excessive yawning, severe tinnitus, and fatigue. Less common side effects include bruxism, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmia, blood pressure changes, dilated pupils, anxiety, mood swings, headache, and dizziness. Rare side effects include convulsions, hallucinations, severe allergic reactions and <b>photosensitivity.</b> If sedation occurs, the dose may be taken at bedtime {{rather than in the}} morning. Some data suggest citalopram may cause nightmares.|$|E
25|$|Deficiency in the enzymes of the {{porphyrin}} pathway {{leads to}} insufficient production of heme. Heme function plays {{a central role}} in cellular metabolism. This is not the main problem in the porphyrias; most heme synthesis enzymes—even dysfunctional enzymes—have enough residual activity to assist in heme biosynthesis. The principal problem in these deficiencies is the accumulation of porphyrins, the heme precursors, which are toxic to tissue in high concentrations. The chemical properties of these intermediates determine the location of accumulation, whether they induce <b>photosensitivity,</b> and whether the intermediate is excreted (in the urine or feces).|$|E
25|$|A form of TTD without <b>photosensitivity</b> also exists, {{although}} its mechanism is unclear. The MPLKIP gene {{has been associated}} with this form of TTD, although it accounts for only 20% of all known cases of the non-photosensitive form of TTD, and the function of its gene product is also unclear. Mutations in the TTDN1 gene explain another 10% of non-photosensitive TTD. The function of the gene product of TTDN1 is unknown, but the sex organs of individuals with this form of TTD often produce no hormones, a condition known as hypogonadism.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of secondary emission (the ability of electrons {{in a vacuum}} tube to cause the emission of additional electrons by striking an electrode) was, at first, limited to purely electronic phenomena and devices (which lacked <b>photosensitivity).</b> In 1899 the effect was first reported by Villard. In 1902, Austin and Starke reported that the metal surfaces impacted by electron beams emitted {{a larger number of}} electrons than were incident. The application of the newly discovered secondary emission to the amplification of signals was only proposed after World War I by Westinghouse scientist Joseph Slepian in a 1919 patent.|$|E
25|$|TTD {{is caused}} by {{mutations}} {{in one of three}} genes, ERCC2, ERCC3, or GTF2H5, the first two of which are also linked to xeroderma pigmentosum. However, patients with TTD do not show a higher risk of developing skin cancer, in contrast to patients with XP. The three genes associated with TTD encode for XPB, XPD and p8/TTDA of the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex, which is involved in transcription and DNA damage repair. Mutations in one of these genes cause reduction of gene transcription, which may be involved in development (including placental development), and thus may explain retardation in intellectual abilities, in some cases; these mutations also lead to reduction in DNA repair, causing <b>photosensitivity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some modern {{researchers}} {{have tried to}} explain the reports of werewolf behaviour with recognised medical conditions. Dr Lee Illis of Guy's Hospital in London wrote a paper in 1963 entitled On Porphyria and the Aetiology of Werewolves, in which he argues that historical accounts on werewolves could have in fact been referring to victims of congenital porphyria, stating how the symptoms of <b>photosensitivity,</b> reddish teeth and psychosis could have been grounds for accusing a sufferer of being a werewolf. This is however argued against by Woodward, who points out how mythological werewolves were almost invariably portrayed as resembling true wolves, and that their human forms were rarely physically conspicuous as porphyria victims. Others have pointed {{out the possibility of}} historical werewolves having been sufferers of hypertrichosis, a hereditary condition manifesting itself in excessive hair growth. However, Woodward dismissed the possibility, as the rarity of the disease ruled it out from happening on a large scale, as werewolf cases were in medieval Europe. People suffering from Down syndrome have been suggested by some scholars to have been possible originators of werewolf myths. Woodward suggested rabies as the origin of werewolf beliefs, claiming remarkable similarities between the symptoms of that disease and some of the legends. Woodward focused on the idea that being bitten by a werewolf could result in the victim turning into one, which suggested the idea of a transmittable disease like rabies. However, the idea that lycanthropy could be transmitted in this way {{is not part of the}} original myths and legends and only appears in relatively recent beliefs. Lycanthropy can also be met with as the main content of a delusion, for example, the case of a woman has been reported who during episodes of acute psychosis complained of becoming four different species of animals.|$|E
25|$|The first {{measurements}} of photoinhibition {{were published in}} 1956 by Bessel Kok. Even {{in the very first}} studies, it was obvious that plants have a repair mechanism that continuously repairs photoinhibitory damage. In 1966, Jones and Kok measured the action spectrum of photoinhibition and found that ultraviolet light is highly photoinhibitory. The visible-light part of the action spectrum was found to have a peak in the red-light region, suggesting that chlorophylls act as photoreceptors of photoinhibition. In the 1980s, photoinhibition became a popular topic in photosynthesis research, and the concept of a damaging reaction counteracted by a repair process was re-invented. Research was stimulated by a paper by Kyle, Ohad and Arntzen in 1984, showing that photoinhibition is accompanied by selective loss of a 32-kDa protein, later identified as the PSII reaction center protein D1. The <b>photosensitivity</b> of PSII from which the oxygen evolving complex had been inactivated with chemical treatment was studied in the 1980s and early 1990s. A paper by Imre Vass and coworkers in 1992 described the acceptor-side mechanism of photoinhibition. species promote chlorophyll triplet formation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA|volume=89| year=1992|pages=14081412 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.89.4.1408|issue = 4}} Measurements of production of singlet oxygen by photoinhibited PSII provided further evidence for an acceptor-side-type mechanism. The concept of a repair cycle that continuously repairs photoinhibitory damage, evolved and was reviewed by Aro et al. in 1993. Many details of the repair cycle, including the finding that the FtsH protease {{plays an important role in}} the degradation of the D1 protein, have been discovered since. In 1996, a paper by Tyystjärvi and Aro showed that the rate constant of photoinhibition is directly proportional to light intensity, a result that opposed the former assumption that photoinhibition is caused by the fraction of light energy that exceeds the maximum capability of photosynthesis. The following year, laser pulse photoinhibition experiments done by Itzhak Ohad's group led to the suggestion that charge recombination reactions may be damaging because they can lead to production of singlet oxygen. The molecular mechanism(s) of photoinhibition are constantly under discussion. The newest candidate is the manganese mechanism suggested 2005 by the group of Esa Tyystjärvi. A similar mechanism was suggested by the group of Norio Murata, also in 2005.|$|E

500|$|In {{more extreme}} cases, plasmapheresis can be considered. This {{technique}} {{is used to}} remove the blood plasma or fluid in the red blood cells and then return the cells to the body. It [...] "removes a circulating factor from the blood that {{may be involved in}} causing the urticaria," [...] but is still being tested and is not always effective. When the treatment is a success, the patient's <b>photosensitivity</b> is decreased to the degree that they can undergo PUVA which can result in the relief of the urticarial outbreaks {{for an extended period of}} time. The major setback to this treatment is that the side effects can be severe and may include anaphylactoid reactions.|$|E
500|$|Solar {{urticaria}} is an immunoglobulin E-mediated hypersensitivity {{that can}} be introduced through primary or secondary factors, or induced by exogenous photosensitization. Primary SU {{is believed to be}} a type I hypersensitivity (a mild to severe reaction to an antigen including anaphylaxis) in which an antigen, or substance provoking an immune response, is [...] "induced by UV or visible radiation." [...] Secondary SU can occur when a person comes into contact with chemicals such as tar, pitch, and dyes. People who use drugs such as benoxaprofen or patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria may also contract this secondary form. These items that cause this <b>photosensitivity</b> are exogenous photosensitizers because they are outside of the body and cause it to have a greater sensitivity to light.|$|E

2500|$|Type III (aka hepatic <b>photosensitivity)</b> is {{the most}} common type of <b>photosensitivity</b> {{reaction}} seen in animals.

[...] Normally, phylloerythrin is secreted into the intestine by the biliary system and excreted through the feces. [...] In Type III <b>Photosensitivity,</b> damage to the biliary transport mechanism prevents the excretion of phylloerythrin, allowing the photodynamic substance to enter the circulatory system and accumulate under the skin. [...] This condition is exacerbated by the presence of hepatic parasites.|$|E
