Xerox's Office Product Division had already been buying Diablo printers for its Redactron text editors. After 7 years trying to make Diablo profitable, the OPD focused on developing and selling the Diablo 630 which was mostly bought by companies such as Digital Equipment Corporation. The Diablo 630 could produce letter quality output as good as that produced by an IBM Selectric or Selectric-based printer, but at a lower cost. A further advantage was that it supported the entire ASCII printing character set. Its servo-controlled carriage also permitted the use of <b>proportional</b> <b>spaced</b> fonts, where characters occupy a different amount of horizontal space according to their width.|$|R
2500|$|The {{frequency}} spectrum of pink noise is linear in logarithmic scale; it has equal power in bands that are proportionally wide.

Since humans hear in such a <b>proportional</b> <b>space,</b> where a doubling of frequency (an octave) is perceived the same regardless of actual frequency (40–60Hz is heard as the same interval and distance as 4000–6000Hz), every octave contains {{the same amount of}} energy and thus pink noise is often used as a reference signal in audio engineering.

2500|$|A {{variation}} {{known as}} [...] "Correcting Selectrics" [...] introduced a correction feature, where a sticky tape {{in front of}} the carbon film ribbon could remove the black-powdered image of a typed character, eliminating the need for little bottles of white dab-on correction fluid and for hard erasers that could tear the paper. These machines also introduced selectable [...] "pitch" [...] so that the typewriter could be switched between pica type (10 characters per inch) and elite type (12 per inch), even within one document. Even so, all Selectrics were monospaced—each character and letterspace was allotted the same width on the page, from a capital [...] "W" [...] to a period. Although IBM had produced a successful typebar-based machine with five levels of <b>proportional</b> <b>spacing,</b> called the IBM Executive, <b>proportional</b> <b>spacing</b> was not provided with the Selectric typewriter or its successors the Selectric II and Selectric III.|$|E

2500|$|The {{horizontal}} spacing of digits {{can also}} be proportional, with a character width tightly matching {{the width of the}} figure itself, or tabular, where all digits have the same width. <b>Proportional</b> <b>spacing</b> places the digits closely together, reducing empty space in a document, and is thought to allow the numbers to blend into the text more effectively. As tabular spacing makes all numbers with the same number of digits the same width, it is used for typesetting documents such as price lists, stock listings and sums in mathematics textbooks, all of which require columns of numeric figures to line up {{on top of each other}} for easier comparison. Tabular spacing is also a common feature of simple printing devices such as cash registers and date-stamps.|$|E
2500|$|Before the First World War {{virtually}} all English-language books were printed following standard typesetters' spacing rules. By {{the end of}} the Second World War most American books and an increasing proportion of English books were printed following the typewriter's English spacing approximation rules. Around this time, the practice of single spacing became more prevalent. There were various circumstances which could have contributed to the change. For example, there was an increase in high-volume low-cost mass-produced printing (e.g., newspapers, pulp-novels, magazines). Also, a significant innovation in the typewriter was the breaking of the typewriter [...] "grid" [...] in 1941. [...] "The grid" [...] referred to the uniform spacing of each letter space in the monospaced font used by the typewriter. In 1941, IBM introduced the Executive, a typewriter that used <b>proportional</b> <b>spacing</b> by [...] "breaking each cell of the grid into fifths." [...] Although proportional fonts had been used in various forms in typesetting since the invention of movable type, this innovation broke the hold that the monospaced font had over the typewriter—reducing the severity of its mechanical limitations.|$|E

40|$|In highly {{repetitive}} strings, like {{collections of}} genomes {{from the same}} species, distinct measures of repetition all grow sublinearly in {{the length of the}} text, and indexes targeted to such strings typically depend only on one of these measures. We describe two data structures whose size depends on multiple measures of repetition at once, and that provide competitive tradeoffs between the time for counting and reporting all the exact occurrences of a pattern, and the space taken by the structure. The key component of our constructions is the run-length encoded BWT (RLBWT), which takes <b>space</b> <b>proportional</b> to the number of BWT runs: rather than augmenting RLBWT with suffix array samples, we combine it with data structures from LZ 77 indexes, which take <b>space</b> <b>proportional</b> to the number of LZ 77 factors, and with the compact directed acyclic word graph (CDAWG), which takes <b>space</b> <b>proportional</b> to the number of extensions of maximal repeats. The combination of CDAWG and RLBWT enables also a new representation of the suffix tree, whose size depends again on the number of extensions of maximal repeats, and that is powerful enough to support matching statistics and constant-space traversal.

40|$|Highly-repetitive {{collections}} of strings {{are increasingly being}} amassed by genome sequencing and genetic variation experiments, {{as well as by}} storing all versions of human-generated files, like webpages and source code. Existing indexes for locating all the exact occurrences of a pattern in a highly-repetitive string take advantage of a single measure of repetition. However, multiple, distinct measures of repetition all grow sublinearly in the length of a highly-repetitive string. In this paper we explore the practical advantages of combining data structures whose size depends on distinct measures of repetition. The main ingredient of our structures is the run-length encoded BWT (RLBWT), which takes <b>space</b> <b>proportional</b> to the number of runs in the Burrows-Wheeler transform of a string. We describe a range of practical variants that combine RLBWT with the set of boundaries of the Lempel-Ziv 77 factors of a string, which take <b>space</b> <b>proportional</b> to the number of factors. Such variants use, respectively, the RLBWT of a string and the RLBWT of its reverse, or just one RLBWT inside a bidirectional index, or just one RLBWT with support for unidirectional extraction. We also study the practical advantages of combining RLBWT with the compact directed acyclic word graph of a string, a data structure that takes <b>space</b> <b>proportional</b> to the number of one-character extensions of maximal repeats. Our approaches are easy to implement, and provide competitive tradeoffs on significant datasets. Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1502. 0593...|$|R
