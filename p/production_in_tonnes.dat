40|$|Animal {{production}} {{is an integral}} part of Ghana’s agricultural economy and a major source of livelihood for many rural households in the Northern, Upper East and Upper West Regions of Ghana. In Ghana, animals are raised under the extensive, semi-intensive and/or intensive system. However, the extensive system is the commonest method and it is practiced most especially in rural communities. Animal production holdings are commercially, family or individually owned. Commercial farmers normally keep poultry, and mostly under the intensive system. Different animal species are reared in Ghana purposely for local consumption. This paper provides an analysis of animal and meat production in Ghana within a 10 year period. Between 2001 and 2010 the average of live animal production was 3, 958, 560 for goats, 3, 269, 460 for sheep, 1, 373, 700 for cattle, 404, 600 for pigs, and 33, 252 for chickens. In general, the increase in goat and sheep production was higher than the increase in cattle, pigs and chicken production within this period. Averages of meat <b>production</b> <b>in</b> <b>Tonnes</b> were 34, 427, 24, 491, 13, 535, 12, 336 and 12, 056, for chicken (chicken meat), beef (cattle meat), pork (pig meat), chevon (goat meat) and mutton (sheep meat), respectively. The increase in chicken meat was the highest within this period. Total meat <b>production</b> <b>in</b> <b>Tonnes</b> was 177, 723 in 2001, 176, 086 in 2002, 181, 686 in 2003, 186, 470 in 2004, 188, 537 in 2005, 191, 021 in 2006, 198, 093 in 2007, 220, 243 in 2008, 232, 516 in 2009 and 244, 742 in 2010. Opportunities for increased animal and meat production in Ghana still exist since the country imports animal and meat from abroad. This overview provides reference data of animal and meat production in Ghana. It is expected that the Government and other stakeholders will use this data in planning and making of policies, and to monitor changes that may occur overtime...|$|E

40|$|The Benchmarking and Energy Savings Tool (BEST) Cement is a process-based tool {{based on}} commercially {{available}} efficiency technologies used {{anywhere in the}} world applicable to the cement industry. This version has been designed for use in China. No actual cement facility with every single efficiency measure included in the benchmark will likely exist; however, the benchmark sets a reasonable standard by which to compare for plants striving to be the best. The energy consumption of the benchmark facility differs due to differences in processing at a given cement facility. The tool accounts for most of these variables and allows the user to adapt the model to operational variables specific for his/her cement facility. Figure 1 shows the boundaries included in a plant modeled by BEST Cement. In order to model the benchmark, i. e., the most energy efficient cement facility, so that it represents a facility similar to the user's cement facility, the user is first required to input <b>production</b> variables <b>in</b> the input sheet (see Section 6 for more information on how to input variables). These variables allow the tool to estimate a benchmark facility that is similar to the user's cement plant, giving a better picture of the potential for that particular facility, rather than benchmarking against a generic one. The input variables required include the following: (1) the amount of raw materials used <b>in</b> <b>tonnes</b> per year (limestone, gypsum, clay minerals, iron ore, blast furnace slag, fly ash, slag from other industries, natural pozzolans, limestone powder (used post-clinker stage), municipal wastes and others); the amount of raw materials that are preblended (prehomogenized and proportioned) and crushed (<b>in</b> <b>tonnes</b> per year); (2) the amount of additives that are dried and ground (<b>in</b> <b>tonnes</b> per year); (3) the <b>production</b> of clinker (<b>in</b> <b>tonnes</b> per year) from each kiln by kiln type; (4) the amount of raw materials, coal and clinker that is ground by mill type (<b>in</b> <b>tonnes</b> per year); (5) the amount of production of cement by type and grade (<b>in</b> <b>tonnes</b> per year); (6) the electricity generated onsite; and, (7) the energy used by fuel type; and, the amount (in RMB per year) spent on energy. The tool offers the user the opportunity to do a quick assessment or a more detailed assessment [...] this choice will determine the level of detail of the energy input. The detailed assessment will require energy data for each stage of production while the quick assessment will require only total energy used at the entire facility (see Section 6 for more details on quick versus detailed assessments). The benchmarking tool provides two benchmarks [...] one for Chinese best practices and one for international best practices. Section 2 describes the differences between these two and how each benchmark was calculated. The tool also asks for a target input by the user for the user to set goals for the facility...|$|R
