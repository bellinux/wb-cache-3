5|$|The video starts showing Arjona {{inside a}} room <b>powering</b> <b>on</b> an old video {{projector}} and singing while watching {{a black and}} white film projected on the wall. This scenes are shown until the music style of the song changes into salsa. Then, after the musical change, scenes of two twin brothers are shown, interpolated, one of them living in Havana, the other living in Miami, Florida. The following scenes show the technological differences to which the brothers are attached, before going into the musical change to merengue and cuban music, on which two large group of kids, led by the two brothers, are shown sprinting throughout two shores until they meet and start to celebrate. Then, the final musical change is shown, along a collage of different scenes from the United States and Cuba. Finally, Arjona is shown again sit along the video projector, and the clip ends. As of 14 July 2012, the video has reached 1.4 million views on YouTube.|$|E
25|$|Integration of sensing and {{actuation}} systems, {{connected to}} the Internet, is likely to optimize energy consumption as a whole. It is expected that IoT devices will be integrated into all forms of energy consuming devices (switches, power outlets, bulbs, televisions, etc.) {{and be able to}} communicate with the utility supply company in order to effectively balance power generation and energy usage. Such devices would also offer the opportunity for users to remotely control their devices, or centrally manage them via a cloud-based interface, and enable advanced functions like scheduling (e.g., remotely <b>powering</b> <b>on</b> or off heating systems, controlling ovens, changing lighting conditions etc.).|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this research are to: (1) Analyze the using of Ignition Booster to the torque and engine <b>power</b> <b>on</b> Yamaha Mio Soul motorcycle 2010. (2) Analyze the variety of spark plug to the torque and engine <b>power</b> <b>on</b> Yamaha Mio Soul motorcycle 2010. Based on the research can be concluded that: (1) The using of Ignition Booster could increase torque and engine <b>power</b> <b>on</b> wheel axis. Its because of the using of Ignition Booster could repair ignition system, So the torque and engine <b>power</b> <b>on</b> wheel axis increase. (2) The using of variety spark plug could increase torque and engine <b>power</b> <b>on</b> wheel axis. Its because of better electrode design on spark plug could increase fire fragment quality, so the torque and engine <b>power</b> <b>on</b> wheel axis increase. (3) The using of Ignition Booster and variety of spark plug could increase torque and engine <b>power</b> <b>on</b> wheel axis. Its because of the using of Ignition Booster could repair combustion system and better electrode design on spark plug could increase fire fragment quality, so the torque and engine <b>power</b> <b>on</b> wheel axis increase. (4) Maximum torque obtained with use ignition booster and Iridium Spark plug, which is 4. 95 ft. lbs at 6000 rpm. Maximum Engine Power obtained with use ignition booster and Iridium Spark plug, which is 6. 49 ft. lbs at 8000 rpm...|$|R
