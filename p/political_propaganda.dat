5|$|Hilary Minc, {{the third}} in command in Bolesław Bierut's {{political}} triumvirate of Stalinist leaders, became the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Industry, Industry and Commerce, and the Economic Affairs. He was personally assigned by Stalin first to Industry and than to Transportation ministries of Poland. His wife, Julia, became the Editor-in-Chief of the monopolized Polish Press Agency. Minister Jakub Berman – Stalin's right hand in Poland until 1953 – held the <b>Political</b> <b>propaganda</b> and Ideology portfolios. He {{was responsible for the}} largest and most notorious secret police {{in the history of the}} People's Republic of Poland, the Ministry of Public Security (UB), employing 33,200 permanent security officers, one for every 800 Polish citizens.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} the urge to {{identify}} scapegoats for the fire is {{the acceptance of the}} confession of a simple-minded French watchmaker named Robert Hubert, who claimed that he was an agent of the Pope and had started the Great Fire in Westminster. He later changed his story to say that he had started the fire at the bakery in Pudding Lane. Hubert was convicted, despite some misgivings about his fitness to plead, and hanged at Tyburn on 28 September 1666. After his death, it became apparent that he had been on board a ship in the North Sea, and had not arrived in London until two days after the fire started. These allegations that Catholics had started the fire were exploited as powerful <b>political</b> <b>propaganda</b> by opponents of pro-Catholic Charles II's court, mostly during the Popish Plot and the exclusion crisis later in his reign.|$|E
50|$|The Kukrynuksy {{are also}} authors of Socialist Realism-style {{paintings}} concerned with historical, <b>political</b> and <b>propaganda</b> topics.|$|R
5000|$|The Program of the Fourth Congress states, [...] "We {{agitate to}} {{politically}} {{shake up the}} proletariat. The aim of our agitation is to draw {{the maximum number of}} workers into the <b>political</b> struggle. Communist <b>propaganda</b> is scientific, theoretical, <b>political</b> education. Our <b>propaganda</b> exposes capitalist production relations as the root cause of the social destruction rampant today. The class struggle is a <b>political</b> struggle; our <b>propaganda</b> convinces the workers that society cannot be organized to meet their basic demands without their seizing political power.” ...|$|R
25|$|The CIA Tibetan program {{consists}} of <b>political</b> plots, <b>propaganda</b> distribution, {{as well as}} paramilitary and intelligence gathering based on U.S. commitments made to the Dalai Lama in 1951 and 1956.|$|R
25|$|In 2004, Beijing {{announced}} a cross-strait controlled-access highway project linking Beijing to Taipei connecting {{the two sides}} of the Taiwan Straits together. However, due to the potential technical difficulties, some people in Taipei consider this move as <b>political</b> <b>propaganda.</b>|$|E
25|$|Political {{media is}} {{pervasive}} in Dravidian politics, with {{five of the}} seven chief ministers from these parties being directly involved in Tamil cinema, either as script writers or actors. Recently television channels owned by these parties have been used for <b>political</b> <b>propaganda</b> purposes.|$|E
25|$|Following the Christian context as {{a symbol}} for evil, serpents are {{sometimes}} featured in <b>political</b> <b>propaganda.</b> They were used to represent Jews in antisemitic propaganda. Snakes were also used to represent the evil side of drugs in such films as Narcotic and Narcotics: Pit of Despair.|$|E
25|$|As in any guerrilla warfare, {{control of}} the populace {{is the key to}} the guerrilla's {{prosperity}} and survival. To this end, Communist forces deployed an elaborate and sophisticated <b>political</b> and <b>propaganda</b> effort.|$|R
5000|$|Over time, Fairey's artistic imagery {{has evolved}} into a {{sometimes}} subtle, sometimes not, parody of a range of iconic styles, mostly a [...] of popular <b>political</b> <b>propagandas</b> and multi-national commercialism. It usually bears the text OBEY Giant.In addition to countless small stickers, OBEY Giant has been spread by stencil, murals, and large wheatpaste posters, covering public and private spaces from building faces and street sign backs, to commercial spaces such as billboards and bus stop posters. Furthermore, the popular [...] "OBEY" [...] slogan and stylized André the Giant face continue to be reproduced on products ranging from art and clothing to home accessories and decor, considerably expanding the impact of the campaign through iconology based on an allegiance to media and popular culture in the guise of counterculture.|$|R
5000|$|There is no {{commonly}} accepted modern {{definition of}} feudalism, {{at least among}} scholars. [...] The adjective feudal was coined in the 17th century, and the noun feudalism, often used in a <b>political</b> and <b>propaganda</b> context, was not coined until the 19th century, from the French féodalité (feudality), itself an 18th-century creation.|$|R
25|$|Some of his {{well-known}} {{works are}} his books Annavin Sattasabai Sorpolivukal (Anna's speeches {{at the state}} legislative, 1960), Ilatchiya varalaru (History of Principles, 1948), Valkkaip puyal (Storm of life, 1948) and Rankon rata (Radha from Rangon). His work Kambarasam criticises Ramayana of Kamban. His works of fiction such as Kapothipura kathal (Love {{in the city of}} Blind), Parvathy B.A., Kalinga rani (Queen of Kalinga) and Pavayin payanam (Travels of a young lady) carried elements of <b>political</b> <b>propaganda.</b>|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} during the Soviet {{domination}} over Communist Poland, {{the knowledge of}} Ukrainian massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia perpetrated against ethnic Poles and Jews, by Ukrainian nationalists and peasants was suppressed for <b>political</b> <b>propaganda</b> reasons. Among the first to suffer mass killings were the units of Polish Army fleeing the German advance in 1939. On top of uniformed men being ambushed, there are records of civilians being murdered along with them, and women raped.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{the coins}} issued by any state have always {{reflected}} {{the current political}} or economic situation. Many ancient and pre-modern coins certainly commemorate events in contemporary times. For instance, Roman coins often have references to military campaigns and the defeat of foreign powers. These reverse types often symbolically represent the subordination of recently conquered territories to Roman authority. Such coins are examples of ancient <b>political</b> <b>propaganda.</b> The Roman Empire may be represented by a proud warrior 'raising' an undersized figure, representing the defeated enemy.|$|E
50|$|The same is {{certainly}} not true of the violently antisemite films of Fritz Hippler. Other Nazi <b>political</b> films made <b>propaganda</b> for so-called euthanasia.|$|R
50|$|TV {{channels}} lack economic sustainability, {{and their}} editorial independence is hindered by financial needs. They are often sponsored by <b>political</b> parties for <b>propaganda</b> purposes.|$|R
50|$|Princen {{quickly became}} famous (or notorious, {{according}} to point of view). In a struggle decided {{as much in}} the international public opinion and diplomatic forums as in the field, the presence of an articulate ex-Dutch soldier with an impeccable anti-Nazi past in the rebel ranks had an obvious <b>political</b> and <b>propaganda</b> significance.|$|R
25|$|He {{was well}} known for his oratorical skills and was an {{acclaimed}} writer in the Tamil language. He scripted and acted in several plays. Some of his plays were later made into movies. He was the first politician from the Dravidian parties to use Tamil cinema extensively for <b>political</b> <b>propaganda.</b> Born in a middle-class family, he first worked as a school teacher, then moved into the political scene of the Madras Presidency as a journalist. He edited several political journals and enrolled {{as a member of}} the Dravidar Kazhagam. As an ardent follower of Periyar E. V. Ramasamy, he rose in stature as a prominent member of the party.|$|E
25|$|The {{death toll}} {{attributable}} to the flight and expulsions is disputed, with estimates ranging from 500,000, up to a West German demographic estimate from the 1950s of over 2 million. More recent estimates by some historians put the total at 500-600,000 attested deaths; they maintain that the West German government figures lack adequate support and that during the Cold War the higher figures were used for <b>political</b> <b>propaganda.</b> The German Historical Museum puts the figure at 600,000, maintaining that the figure of 2 million deaths in the previous government studies cannot be supported. The current official position of the German government is that the death toll resulting from the flight and expulsions ranged from 2 to 2.5 million civilians.|$|E
25|$|The Bride and the Butterfly Hunter (1974) is a quirky, surrealistic {{film version}} of a play by Nisim Aloni about a bride who flees her wedding and a clerk who flees his humdrum {{existence}} by escaping to the park every Wednesday afternoon to hunt—and release—butterflies. The encounter between the two {{takes place in a}} park, where <b>political</b> <b>propaganda</b> is broadcast over a loudspeaker system. Though this is not integral to the story, it indicates that even in the most whimsical encounters it is impossible to escape the overbearing presence of political forces exploiting the conflicts in Israel for their own advantage. This film was selected to represent Israel at the Prix Italia.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1930s, though {{motivated}} by <b>political</b> and <b>propaganda</b> reasons, several cultural exchanges between Japan and Germany took place. A focus {{was put on}} youth exchanges, and numerous mutual visits were conducted; for instance, in late 1938, the ship Gneisenau carried a delegation of 30 members of the Hitlerjugend to Tokyo for a study visit.|$|R
5000|$|The {{prevalent}} {{explanation as}} to why the status of [...] "honorary Aryan" [...] was bestowed by the Nazis upon other non-Nordic [...] - [...] or even less exclusively, non-Indo-Iranian/European peoples [...] - [...] is that the services of those peoples were deemed valuable to the German economy or war effort, or simply for other purely <b>political</b> or <b>propaganda</b> reasons.|$|R
50|$|The {{permanent}} exhibition, which attracts about 40,000 visitors annually, conveys on ca. 1,000 square meters {{an impression}} {{of the history of}} German-Soviet relations from 1917 to 1990. The focus is on the German-Soviet War 1941-1945, including the <b>political</b> background, <b>propaganda</b> and hostile stereotypes, and the day-to-day life of soldiers and civilians {{on both sides of this}} conflict during different phases of the war.|$|R
25|$|Xiang Yu {{appointed}} several generals {{from the}} rebel coalition as vassal kings, {{even though these}} generals were subordinates of other lords, who should rightfully be the kings in place of their followers. Xiang Yu also left out some other important rebel leaders who did not support him earlier, but did contribute to the overthrow of Qin. In winter, Xiang Yu moved Emperor Yi to the remote area of Chen County (郴縣; present-day Chenzhou, Hunan), effectively sending the puppet emperor into exile. At the same time, he issued a secret order to the vassal kings in that area and had the emperor assassinated during his journey in 205 BCE. The emperor's death was later used by Liu Bang as <b>political</b> <b>propaganda</b> to justify his war against Xiang Yu.|$|E
25|$|In {{the domain}} of letters he {{remained}} until his death a veritable pontiff, and an article or book of his was an event celebrated {{from one end of}} Portugal to the other. The nation continued to look up to him for intellecual leadership, but, in his later years, lacking hope himself, he could not stimulate others or use to advantage the powers conferred upon him. In politics he remained a constitutional Liberal of the old type, and, for him, the people were the middle classes in opposition to the lower, which he saw to have been the supporters of tyranny in all ages, while he considered radicalism to mean a return via anarchy to absolutism. However, though he conducted <b>political</b> <b>propaganda</b> campaigns in the press in his early days, Herculano never exercised much influence in politics.|$|E
25|$|The Cuban Project {{played a}} {{significant}} role in the events leading up to the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. The Project's six-phase schedule was presented by Edward Lansdale on February 20, 1962; it was overseen by Attorney General Robert Kennedy. President Kennedy was briefed on the operation's guidelines on March 16, 1962. Lansdale outlined the coordinated program of political, psychological, military, sabotage, and intelligence operations as well as assassination attempts on key political leaders. Each month since his presentation, a different method was in place to destabilize the communist regime. Some of these plans included the publication of Anti-Castro <b>political</b> <b>propaganda,</b> armaments for militant opposition groups, the establishment of guerrilla bases throughout the country, and preparations for an October military intervention in Cuba. Many individual plans were devised by the CIA to assassinate Castro, however none were successful.|$|E
5000|$|His artistic {{interests}} and talents were recognised {{and he was}} assigned to a squad of “Entertainment Soldiers” [...] as a propaganda poster artist. During this time, (and even to the present day [...] ) the military took visual arts, theatre and performing arts as important tools for <b>political</b> indoctrination, <b>propaganda,</b> to promote and communicate the communist party’s ideology as well as boost morale.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the quick}} improvised course of events, {{the exact number}} of {{casualties}} is very difficult to state. The estimates vary widely and have become a source of <b>political</b> disputes and <b>propaganda.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Overclaiming {{can also}} occur for <b>political</b> or <b>propaganda</b> reasons. It was common {{for both sides}} to inflate figures for [...] "kills" [...] or deflate figures for losses in {{broadcasts}} and news reports. Most of the examples listed below are overclaiming during World War II has been the centre of much scrutiny, {{partly because of the}} significant amount of air combat relative to other conflicts.|$|R
25|$|The Ganga Action Plan, {{which was}} taken on {{priority}} and with much enthusiasm, was delayed for two years. The expenditure was almost doubled. But {{the result was}} not very appreciable. Much expenditure was done over the <b>political</b> <b>propaganda.</b> The concerning governments and the related agencies were not very prompt {{to make it a}} success. The public of the areas was not taken into consideration. The releasing of urban and industrial wastes in the river was not controlled fully. The flowing of dirty water through drains and sewers were not adequately diverted. The continuing customs of burning dead bodies, throwing carcasses, washing of dirty clothes by washermen, and immersion of idols and cattle wallowing were not checked. Very little provision of public latrines was made and the open defecation of lakhs of people continued along the riverside. All these made the Action Plan a failure.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1769, New York was in a {{depression}} from the recall of paper boycott and the British boycott. By the Currency Act New York was required to recall all paper money. London allowed the issuance of additional paper money, but the attached conditions were unsatisfactory. While New York was boycotting British imports, other colonies including Boston and Philadelphia were not. The De Lanceys tried to reach a compromise by passing a bill which allowed for the issuing of paper currency, of which half was for provisioning of the troops. Alexander McDougall, signed a 'Son of Liberty', issued a broadside entitled To the Betrayed Inhabitants of the City and Colony of New York which was an excellent piece of <b>political</b> <b>propaganda</b> denouncing the De Lanceys for betraying the liberties of the people by acknowledging the British power of taxation. The Sons of Liberty switched their allegiance from the De Lanceys to the Livingstons. Alexander McDougall was arrested for libel.|$|E
25|$|All private {{property}} and – crucial to Jewish economic life – private businesses were nationalized; political activity was delegalized {{and thousands of people}} were jailed, many of whom were later executed. Zionism, which was designated by the Soviets as counter-revolutionary was also forbidden. In just one day all Polish and Jewish media were shut down and replaced by the new Soviet press, which conducted <b>political</b> <b>propaganda</b> attacking religion including the Jewish faith. Synagogues and churches were not yet closed but heavily taxed. The Soviet ruble of little value was immediately equalized to the much higher Polish zloty {{and by the end of}} 1939, zloty was abolished. Most economic activity became subject to central planning and the NKVD restrictions. Since the Jewish communities tended to rely more on commerce and small scale businesses, the confiscations of property affected them to a greater degree than the general populace. The Soviet rule resulted in near collapse of the local economy, characterized by insufficient wages and general shortage of goods and materials. The Jews, like other inhabitants of the region, saw a fall in their living standards.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the course}} of history, many nations and {{political}} organisations have utilised <b>political</b> censorship and <b>propaganda</b> in order to manipulate the public. The Ancien régime, for example, {{is well known for}} having implemented censorship.|$|R
5|$|In stamp {{collecting}} circles, the word forerunner usually describes {{a postage stamp}} used during the time period before a region or territory issues stamps of its own. However, in Irish reference books, such as Handbook of Irish Philately, the term forerunners usually refers to <b>political</b> and <b>propaganda</b> labels. These often resemble stamps, but few of them were used on Irish mail {{and they had no}} legal standing for mail in Ireland.|$|R
5000|$|One {{group who}} {{understood}} {{the role that}} music played in spreading their political message was the Nazis in Hitler's Germany. Clearly understanding the link between music and <b>political</b> warfare, <b>propaganda</b> minister Josef Goebbels once stated:"Music affects the heart and emotions more than the intellect. Where then could {{the heart of a}} nation beat stronger than in the huge masses, in which the heart of a nation has found its true home?" ...|$|R
