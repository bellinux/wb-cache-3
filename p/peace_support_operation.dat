50|$|Exercise Aman Sena: Exercise Aman Sena was {{conducted}} from 21 May to 29 May 2009 under {{the mandate of}} <b>Peace</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Operations</b> (PSO), a United Nations mandated platform with India as the coordinating nation.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the primary role of {{the defense of the}} Republic of Kenya and the secondary role of aid to civil authority, the Kenya Army has participated and continues to participate in international <b>Peace</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Operations.</b> <b>Peace</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Operations</b> within the Kenya Army {{can be traced back to}} 1973 when the United Nations requested the republic of Kenya to contribute forces for <b>Peace</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Operations</b> in the volatile Middle East after the 1973 the Israel/Arabs war. Even though Kenya acceded to the UN request the troops were not deployed due to various logistical constraints.|$|R
5000|$|As {{stability}} and peace deepened in Sierra Leone, the RSLAF aimed {{to create a}} capability to contribute to international <b>peace</b> <b>support</b> <b>operations.</b> Official websites said that '..To this end the RSLAF has targeted 2007 as the base year to initiate a Company for <b>Peace</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Operations</b> for the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Union and the UN. This would be gradually increased to a battalion strength by 2010. As a demonstration of this desire, a <b>Peace</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Operations</b> Course was introduced into the curriculum of the Horton Military Academy in Freetown. The course was intended to enhance capacity building, and to train and prepare officers of the RSLAF for their future role and participation in international <b>peace</b> <b>support</b> <b>operations,</b> and especially for the proposed ECOWAS Standby Force.' ...|$|R

40|$|Participating in <b>peace</b> <b>support</b> <b>operations</b> {{has been}} and remains a {{significant}} part of the Swedish defense and security politics. Since the end of the Cold War, the Swedish national defence has been more and more dismantled, in favor of international <b>peace</b> <b>support</b> <b>operations</b> which have become an increasingly important task for the Swedish defence. Why then, is Sweden so engaged in conflicts so far from home? Using two classic theories of international politics, realism and liberalism, this study aims to shed light on arguments from the Swedish parliament on why it is important for Sweden to participate in international <b>peace</b> <b>support</b> <b>operations.</b> After analyzing arguments of the Social Democrat Party, the Moderate Party, the Green Party and the Liberal Party concerning three different <b>peace</b> <b>support</b> <b>operations</b> which Sweden has participated in, the result shows that although both realism and liberalism are influencing the parties’ argumentation, liberalism is the theory which is used more often. Thus, the answer to why Sweden participates in <b>peace</b> <b>support</b> <b>operations</b> is to be found in arguments that clearly express views of liberalism, rather than views of realism...|$|R

50|$|In 2005, nine Bangladeshi peacekeepers {{were killed}} in Congo. Bangladesh had 1300 troops {{deployed}} in the country. In 2007, allegations of misconduct against Bangladesh peacekeepers based in South Sudan emerged. Some personal were sent back to Bangladesh and faced disciplinary actions by the Bangladesh army. As of October 2014, Bangladesh contributed {{the highest number of}} total personnel to United Nations Peacekeeping Operations, with 8,758 personnel attached to various UN peacekeeping forces worldwide. In May 2015, one Bangladeshi peacekeeper was killed in a militant attack in Mali during MINUSMA. In 2015, Bangladesh deployed the first all female peacekeeping unit in Haiti, composed of 160 Muslim female troops. The unit was the subject of the documentary Journey of a Thousand Miles: Peacekeepers. Bangladesh trains peacekeepers in the purpose built BIPSOT (Bangladesh Institute of <b>Peace</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Operation</b> Training). In 2015, Bangladesh deployed boats to patrol the Niger river in Mali. Bangladeshi peacekeepers were also deployed in UNAMSIL mission in Sierra Leone.|$|E
5000|$|From 2008 until 2010, the {{training}} and capacity building cycle AMANI AFRICA I (meaning “peace in Africa,” in Swahili), designed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} ASF for an AU mandated <b>peace</b> <b>support</b> <b>operation</b> (PSO) was conducted by the African Union in collaboration with the European Union. It climaxed in the first continental exercise, called a Command Post Exercise (CPX), of this kind in Addis Ababa. AMANI AFRICA I focused mostly on validating policies and processes, at the continental strategic level, in employing the African Standby Force within the broader African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA). According to the AU, it provided objective evidence to support proposals for further organizational and operational developments of training, procedures and multidimensional capacities of the ASF.The African Union Commission (AUC) is planning to conduct a field training exercise (FTX) in October 2014 in Lesotho at the climax of an ongoing training cycle known as AMANI AFRICA II. According to the AU, the AMANI AFRICA II cycle aims at enabling the ASF to achieve its FOC by 2015 and especially at [...] "validating the capacity of the African Union to grant a mandate for the use of a Rapid Deployment Capability, as an initial operation for scenario six and lead in the process, a fully-fledged multidimensional peace operation (scenario 5)." ...|$|E
50|$|Peace support {{within an}} {{international}} context {{is one of}} the three tasks of the Swiss Armed Forces. This mission is laid down in the Swiss Federal Constitution and the Swiss Military Act. Apart from peace support, the three tasks of the Swiss Armed Forces include defence and subsidiary support of the civilian authorities. Although Switzerland is {{not a member of the}} NATO alliance, the Swiss Armed Forces are participating with SWISSCOY (acronym for Swiss Company) in the international peace support mission of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) in Kosovo. This mission is carried out within the context of the military cooperation programme Partnership for Peace between NATO and various non-member states.SWISSCOY’s mission is based on the decision of the Federal Council of 23 June 1999 to participate military in KFOR - on the basis of UN Resolution 1244. SWISSCOY’s mandate is always given for three years. At the end of 2013, the Federal Council recommended extending the mandate for a further three years (until the end of 2017). In the spring of 2014, Parliament passed renewed extension of the mandate until the end of 2017. Parliament has the power to decide on the coming three years, i.e. whether Swiss engagement is to continue.The mission of SWISSCOY is compatible with neutrality for three reasons: Firstly, the KFOR mission is based on the agreement of both conflicting parties. Secondly, Switzerland is exclusively engaged in peace support, participation in combat activity for peace enforcement is and continues to be excluded. And thirdly, the service of Swiss military personnel in the <b>peace</b> <b>support</b> <b>operation</b> is voluntary.The Swiss contingent is relieved of service in a bi-annual rhythm.|$|E

40|$|Various {{countries}} {{have been involved in}} the process of the separation of Indonesian National Police (INP) from the military, which started alongside the democratization of the Indonesian state. Although this is not an example of post-conflict <b>peace</b> <b>support</b> <b>operation,</b> it is one of the closest examples where outside intervention seems to have had some impact. This paper examines the efforts by the US, IOM, and Japan each trying to influence the process in its own way, and attempts to draw lessons for post-conflict police building cases. This work was supported in part by Global COE Program "The Transferability of East Asian Development Strategies and State Building", Mext, Japan. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of cases of sexual exploitation and abuse of children and women committed by the personnel of United Nations peace support operations {{have been brought to}} the attention of the public, especially in recent years. As multiple actors are involved in United Nations peace support operations, i. a. the United Nations itself and Troop Contributing States, the question of attribution of responsibility is highly important – either as multiple responsibility or as the sole responsibility of one entity. This thesis will investigate the issue of international responsibility and examine who carries the onus for such misconduct. The issue of international responsibility in the context of United Nations peace support operations is not merely theoretically interesting, but it also holds practical consequences for victims wishing to file a legal case against the United Nations as with the current so-called Cholera Complaint. Key Words: <b>Peace</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Operation,</b> International Responsibility, Attribution of Conduct, Effective Control and Command, Human Rights Violation, Human Rights Obligation, Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, Redress and Compensation...|$|E
40|$|The Portuguese Armed Forces {{have sent}} 37 {{military}} personnel to Afghanistan whose main {{objective was to}} take on the command of Kabul International Airport (KAIA) for circa 4 months (from August to December 2005). During the preparation for this <b>peace</b> <b>support</b> <b>operation,</b> the commander of the task force, asked the Air Force Psychology Centre for cooperation, which was further designated “the support of Psychology to KAIA Command“. An intervention programme was elaborated so as to be implemented in the different mission phases. The present paper describes and analyzes the experiment of psychological evaluation and intervention in the support to the present ISAF mission. As I was getting ready to leave my office in a late afternoon in the beginning of 2005, I was caught by a telephone call from a Portuguese Air Force (PoAF) officer who, in a very blunt and direct manner, said:- “I am Lieutenant-Colonel Ruivo, appointed to command a military force (COMKAIA) to support ISAF. The main mission is to operate and keep Kabul International Airport secure for a period of 4 months. ...|$|E
