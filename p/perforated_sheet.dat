2500|$|The effect {{predicted}} by Herivel {{did not immediately}} {{show up in the}} Enigma traffic, however, and Bletchley Park had to continue to rely on a different technique to get into Enigma: the method of [...] "perforated sheets", which had been passed on by Polish cryptologists. The situation changed on 1 May 1940, when the Germans changed their indicating procedure, rendering the <b>perforated</b> <b>sheet</b> method obsolete.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the mechanical response of thin <b>sheets</b> <b>perforated</b> with a square array of mutually orthogonal cuts, which leaves {{a network of}} squares connected by small ligaments. Our combined analytical, experimental and numerical results indicate that under uniaxial tension the ligaments buckle out-of-plane, inducing the formation of 3 D patterns whose morphology {{is controlled by the}} load direction. We also find that by largely stretching the buckled <b>perforated</b> <b>sheets,</b> plastic strains develop in the ligaments. This gives rise to the formation of kirigami sheets comprising periodic distribution of cuts and permanent folds. As such, the proposed buckling-induced pop-up strategy points to a simple route for manufacturing complex morphable structures out of flat <b>perforated</b> <b>sheets...</b>|$|R

Over his head was a tow wig, surmounted by a large cap of Mr. Butteridge's with the flaps down over his ears. And some fur sleeping-boots of Mr. Butteridge's warmed his feet. The car of the balloon was small and neat, some bags of ballast the untidiest of its contents, and {{he had found a}} light folding-table and put it at his elbow, and on that was a glass with champagne. And about him, above and below, was space--such a clear emptiness and silence of space as only the aeronaut can experience.|$|E

5000|$|Jeffreys was put {{in charge}} of a small section {{manufacturing}} <b>perforated</b> <b>sheets</b> for use in the cryptanalysis of the Enigma, a task which took over three months, completed on 7 January 1940. One type were the Zygalski sheets, known as Netz at Bletchley Park, a technique revealed to the British by Polish cryptologists. Another type, named [...] "Jeffreys sheets", were different, and were a [...] "catalogue of the effect of any two Enigma rotors and the reflector". Jeffreys's <b>perforated</b> <b>sheets</b> were used by Polish cryptologists in exile in France to make the first wartime decryption of an Enigma message on 17 January 1940.|$|R

First, contain information about mechanical properties of perforated metallic materials as strength and stiffness, which are based on the equivalent solid material concept.

Next, is present a yield criterion for the <b>perforated</b> <b>sheets</b> with low ligament ratios. In second part is presented an experimental investigation whose purpose is to analyze the effect of perforated elements on pressure drops in a double skin cavity.
