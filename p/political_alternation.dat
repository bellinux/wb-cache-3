Through a statistical analysis of the makeup of 13 legislatures (from 1958 to 2007), it, on the one hand, provides a portrait of the deputies, and, on the other hand, describes the evolution over time of the deputies. At first glance, it appears that the presence of women in the Assemblée Nationale is quite recent and, second, that the generational effects are more or less linked to <b>political</b> <b>alternations.</b> Third, despite the progressive disappearance of certain professions, the socio professional structure is particularly stable, and, fourth, the renewal of deputies is very circumstantial.

Understanding change {{or the lack of}} change in office is one of the central tasks in political science. Politicians value office as an intrinsic goal. Winning office and survival in it are the essence of politics (Downs, 1957 : 28; Riker, 1962 : 23). The point of departure of my research was drawn from Madeira exceptionalism: for nearly forty years, the region has not experienced or promoted any kind of <b>political</b> <b>alternation</b> and elite’ circulation. By comparing the political systems of three regions – the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands – I conclude that the cycles of alternation tend to be longer than those registered at national level. Furthermore, the incumbent parties at the three political contexts benefit from a pivotal position, due to their repeatedly electoral success for more than three consecutive mandates...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Nearly every {{government}} {{within each}} sate of the United States has {{a balanced budget}} requirement at either the constitutional or statutory level. Surprisingly enough, historical data shows that the constraints on deficits have not been effective as many states {{in any given year}} still experience a budget deficit. The current literature on United States state government budget constraints has examined whether these constraints can be translated to the national level. Other studies have analyzed the role of unified and split state governments on fiscal performance, but the literature has not examined the impact of voters changing governors. The primary contention of this paper is whether <b>political</b> <b>alternation,</b> measured by the turnover of gubernatorial candidates, has an impact on the fiscal performance within a state. Thus, our hypothesis is that if the gubernatorial office changes party frequently it creates instability that weakens fiscal performance. Using panel data for the period 1980 - 2000 we construct an index of <b>political</b> <b>alternation</b> (IPA) for each state to test our hypothesis. The IPA has been used to measure political instability in developing countries and has been found to explain increased deficit spending. Since forty of the fifty state governments experience at least one party change over the period under examination. We are interested in whether this conclusion holds true in a developed country. This paper contributes to the current literature by adding to classical explanations of public sector economics the effect of party alternation on fiscal performance...|$|E

40|$|Mexico’s gradual democratization had a {{critical}} point in 2000, when the presidential elec-tion brought about <b>political</b> <b>alternation</b> in that country. If democracy requires a compati-ble value system that helps such a system endure, how democratic are Mexicans today and what implications does this have for democratic consolidation in Mexico? This article examines new survey data to address this old question. Our findings reveal that the pre-vailing political culture in Mexico expresses comparatively low support for democracy and relatively high support for non-democratic government, on the one hand, and low interpersonal trust, low levels of tolerance, and {{a strong emphasis on}} deference, on the other. Education is an important determinant of democratic values, and individual varia-tion is significant {{on a wide range of}} attitudes. Changes over time also indicate that Mexicans have reinforced both democratic and non-democratic values in the last few years, which makes it hard to assess whether, overall, Mexico’s democratic values are expanding or shrinking...|$|E

The econometric analysis of the model shows a strong contribution of the critical political situation in CAR on the degradation of the health state of people living in Cameroon. Several reasons justify this argument: the influx of refugees from one country to another and the dissemination of diseases amplified by the precariousness of their living condition on the Cameroon territory.

40|$|Ever {{since the}} National Action Party (PAN) won the {{governor}} {{elections in the}} State of Baja California in 1989, Mexico experienced the inauguration of a <b>political</b> <b>alternation</b> in a governor’s office, which brought about the smashing of the myth {{that it was impossible}} for the PRI to share power at that level. The scarce forums won or surrendered by the party ever present in power, allowed the opposition to confront and criticize the centralization of power and the neutralization of representation, that is, rather than offering its voters nationalistic discourses, the opposition parties joined the cause of the anti-centralist resent, particularly present {{in the northern part of}} the country, and discredited the decaying relationship between the legislative and the executive powers (the presidency), both at a federal and states levels. In view of these considerations, the possibilities of setting the foundations for a new horizontal and vertical relationship among powers in the state of Baja California, which during the last ten years has been governed by the National Action Party, are discussed in this essay...|$|E

40|$|Italy {{experienced}} {{a political system}} during the post war period which many have defined as a 'particracy' of a 'polarised' kind. This produced a permanent one party government (run by the Christian Democracy) along with a one party opposition (the Italian Communist Party). There was no alternation in government which subsequently brought on other difficulties {{not to mention a}} 'deficit in democracy'. The system was defined by some as being "blocked". With the end of the Cold War in 1991 and the political crisis which followed soon after (in 1992 - 94), changes occurred to the Italian political process. Traditional parties that had dominated the political process ceased to exist or radically changed. New parties emerged including Forza Italia, the party of the current Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi. Corruption revelations uncovered a systemic wholesale level of political corruption cutting across most parties and factions. Changes occurred {{as a result of these}} new political developments.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an evaluation}} {{of some of the}} basic assumptions of the literature on governance and their utility for understanding a specific case - that of Mexico. It argues that Mexican municipalities, like their counterparts in Europe and the United States, have experienced a change towards a way of policy-making based on broader policy-networks, fragmentation in governmental and societal bodies, participation of an increasing number of self-organised actors, and the resulting blurring boundaries between the public and private spheres. Mexican urban municipalities are evolving from traditional patterns of governmental interventions to dynamisms of local governance. This shift, however, has taken place in an uneven way, shaped by factors such as the complexity of urban problems, the <b>political</b> <b>alternation,</b> the federal policies on transfers, the different policy areas and issues, the looseness of networks {{and the way in which}} they operate. As a result, Mexican local governance has been developed in policy sectors that have a high legitimising potential or that are in great need for citizens’ resources. This has generated a picture of ‘patches’, where stronger policy networks and citizens’ involvement in policy-making coexist with traditional governmental mechanisms. The dissertation is a contribution to the differentiated accounts of local governance recently developed, which use diverse contexts to argue that there is not a ‘one size fits all’ form of governance. It is a reconsideration of the importance of local contexts in shaping policy-making through networks, as opposed to the initial context-free governance understandings. The conclusion recognises the relevance of the main arguments of governance literature. The thesis makes use of empirical evidence gathered in three urban municipalities. It employs qualitative methodological criteria, discussed in the methodological appendix. The main research techniques used were elite interviewing and documental analysis.

The {{modification}} of the formal rules regulating the functioning of democracy has become an increasingly important field of research in political science, {{all the more so}} in a context of decline of political support in consolidated democracies. This thesis focuses on reforms of the core democratic rules in Western European democracies during the two last decades, adopting an expansive focus in order to adopt a multidimensional and longitudinal approach to institutional engineering. It investigates the occurrence of reform, successively examining the description and the characterisation of reforms, their contextual determinants and the mechanisms of change, articulating mixed-methods including large-N statistical analyses and case studies. The main theoretical innovation of the thesis is the concept of bundle of reform, defined as institutional reforms linked to each other and relating to several dimensions of the institutional architecture. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, thanks to an original database including 6 categories of reform, it is demonstrated that institutional reforms in the last few decades have been frequent, have happened in bundles, and have been moving towards more inclusive institutions. When studying the long- and short-term determinants of the number of reforms, certain long-term factors foster a favourable structural environment for the occurrence of institutional reforms, in particular a lack of political support from citizens for their institutions, but also the disproportional electoral systems in majoritarian democracies. In the short-term, institutional reforms in a given legislature tend to be more numerous after <b>political</b> <b>alternation,</b> and in contexts of rising electoral uncertainty. The thesis also evidences the fact that neither constitutional rigidity nor the number of partisan veto players can be considered to be the main explanation, or even relevant at all in some cases. The second part of the thesis focuses on understanding why, in favourable contexts, some reforms succeed and others fail, investigating case studies of three bundles of reforms in France, Ireland and Italy. The main finding evidences that the final outcomes of reforms are dependent on the combination of the nature of the reforms at stake (divisive or consensual) and the process used to adopt them (majoritarian, supermajoritarian or externalised). Divisive reforms tend to obey a self-interested logic, and their success depends on the ability to build an agreement in relation to a package deal of reforms. During the processes of consensual reform, credit-claiming logics prevail. When the majority chooses to exclude opposition parties and interest groups from the elaboration of reforms in order to claim sole credit, the fate of such reforms depends on the attitude of the opposition, who may choose to oppose the reform in order to symbolically defeat the government...|$|E
