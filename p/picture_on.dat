5|$|Prior to broadcast, series creator Shonda Rhimes did {{not release}} much {{information}} about the season premiere. However, it was revealed prior to broadcast {{that there would be}} a time jump in the episode. After it was announced that Dane would be departing shortly after the commencement of the ninth season, Dempsey uploaded a set <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> Twitter of Sloan in bad condition. Due to the unwanted release of spoilers, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) requested that he delete the photo, and it was subsequently removed. The cast and crew of Grey's Anatomy were being particularly quiet about the fate of Capshaw's character. This secrecy was compromised when McKidd posted a <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> his Twitter account of the editing room, in which there was a picture of Robbins alive on the screen. The picture has since been taken down.|$|E
5|$|Jim Broadbent plays Charles Stanforth, {{the dean}} of Marshall College and friend of Jones. Broadbent's {{character}} stands in for Marcus Brody, whose actor, Denholm Elliott, died in 1992. As a tribute to Elliott, the filmmakers put a portrait and a statue on the Marshall College location, and a <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> Jones' desk, saying he died shortly after Indiana's father.|$|E
5|$|The art {{direction}} for the 1988 release was instead put {{in the hands of}} CBS Records' art director Arnold Levine and his staff. They based the cover art on a fin de siècle image of the Cliff House, a restaurant perched on the cliffs just north of Ocean Beach on the western side of San Francisco, California, built with the architectural style of a Victorian château and destroyed by fire in 1907. The back cover is a maritime landscape, modified to appear as the continuation of the <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> the front and similarly tinted in sinister black and grey colors.|$|E

5|$|The <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> {{the front}} cover of the {{original}} album was kept for the 2003 reissue. However, the design was altered slightly by graphic designer Rachel Gutek of the design company guppyart. This release contains an expanded booklet written by music journalist Max Bell giving the background to the album. The booklet contains a number of photographs which are credited to Sergeant and Pattinson.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a shot {{of a little girl}} {{sleeping}} in her bed. As the music starts, rays of light emanate from the bedside radio with cartoon violins playing the music. The sun rises inside a <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> the wall and the girl wakes and starts playing with her doll. A fairy goes around tapping all her toys on the floor and a large, golden teapot comes alive and shoots a rainbow from its spout. A cartoon version of the girl then slides along the rainbow and, interpreting the lyrics of the song, catches a falling star and rides over the moon.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine {{is widely}} used for purifying water, {{especially}} potable water supplies and water used in swimming pools. Several catastrophic collapses of swimming pool ceilings have occurred from chlorine-induced stress corrosion cracking of stainless steel suspension rods. Some polymers are also sensitive to attack, including acetal resin and polybutene. Both materials were used in hot and cold water domestic plumbing, and stress corrosion cracking caused widespread failures in the USA in the 1980s and 1990s. The <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> the right shows a fractured acetal joint in a water supply system. The cracks started at injection molding defects in the joint and slowly grew until the part failed. The fracture surface shows iron and calcium salts that were deposited in the leaking joint from the water supply before failure.|$|E

5|$|In the Mediterranean Sea, Italian {{fishermen}} rescue {{an unconscious}} American (Matt Damon) floating adrift with two gunshot wounds in his back. They tend to his wounds, {{and when the}} man wakes, they find he suffers from dissociative amnesia. He has no memory of his own identity, while he retains his speech and finds himself capable of advanced combat skills and fluency in several languages. The skipper finds a tiny laser projector under the man's hip that, when activated, gives a number of a safe deposit box in Zürich. Upon landing in Imperia (Italy), the man heads to the bank in Switzerland to investigate the deposit box. He finds it contains a large sum of money in various currencies, numerous passports and identity cards with his <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> all of them, and a handgun. The man takes everything but the gun, and leaves, opting to use {{the name on the}} American passport, Jason Bourne.|$|E
5|$|The postcards used to {{introduce}} a country and their participants were shot in their respective countries and featured the artists using unique ways to create their country's flag, e.g. the postcard for the United Kingdom features Molly creating the Union Flag from AEC Routemaster buses, Royal Mail vans, and people wearing blue raincoats along with strips of red and white paper, and the postcard for Denmark featuring Basim and his singers using old furniture and red and white paint to paint the Danish flag. The postcards then ended with the act taking a <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> a camera or phone and a close up of the resulting artwork was shown onscreen. The flag created by the artist(s) is then captured into a diamond and it transitions to the official flag. It then swirls round for the before-hand details of the artist/composer. For example, the entry for San Marino features the painting of the flag that Valentina Monetta (the artist) created, transitioning into the official flag for San Marino.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, {{the motion}} picture {{industry}} was threatened by the advent of television—TV kept moviegoers at home, reducing box office revenues. Film studios sought to lure audiences to theaters with attractions that television could not provide. These included a revival of color films, three-dimensional films, stereophonic sound, and widescreen movies. Cinerama {{was one of the}} first widescreen movie processes of the era. In its initial conception, the cumbersome system required three cameras for shooting and three synchronized projectors to display a <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> one wide, curved screen. Along with the logistical and financial challenges of tripling equipment usage and cost, the process led to distracting vertical lines between the three projected images. Looking for a high-impact method of widescreen filmmaking that was cheaper, simpler, and less visually distracting, 20th Century Fox acquired the rights to a process it branded CinemaScope: in this system, the film was shot with anamorphic lenses. The film was then exhibited with a complementary anamorphic lens on the projector that expanded the image, creating a projected aspect ratio (the ratio of the image's width to its height) twice that of the image area on the physical frame of film. By the time the first CinemaScope movie—The Robe (1953)—was announced for production, Gottschalk, Moore and Nicholson had a demo reel of work with their anamorphic underwater system.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Nima Nourizadeh and released on 11 December 2006. It opens with an aerial shot of a piano which begins to play by itself, and then moves to reveal a film set. Allen stands on a lamppost, wearing a raincoat, with lights, a camera and directors surrounding her. The image zooms into the camera from the studio and turns the video black-and-white, with the story coming to life, as the singer begins the first verse. From the lamppost {{she is able to}} see her former self walking down the street with her boyfriend. While they enter a building, a light comes out in one of the windows, revealing their silhouettes kissing. The caption changes, with the two of them dancing, while a man plays the piano in the background; as he dips her and holds this position, she continues to sing. The camera zooms out to see a heart shaped window surrounding the two that opens and changes to a <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> Allen's wall. She is alone in a room, staring at a mirror. Her hair is let down and she is wearing a white nightgown. The piano is seen again playing itself, as the image shifts to the window, where Allen is again portrayed leaning against the lamppost in the street, as {{in the beginning of the}} video. She again looks at the silhouettes in the window of the building, as it collapses on her, once again changing the scene. This time, the singer is looking through another window, and then turns around to a mirror which captures a door. The former Allen with the raincoat walks through with her boyfriend, as their shadows are seen kissing. The image changes to Allen from the film set, zooming out from the camera's viewing piece, making the video in colour again.|$|E
