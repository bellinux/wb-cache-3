5|$|Appendicitis may <b>present</b> <b>with</b> vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, and a {{small amount}} of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.|$|E

40|$|Although {{we live in}} a multisensory world, children's {{memory has}} been usually studied concentrating on only one sensory {{modality}} at a time.

Children (n = 114) from three age groups (8, 10 and 12 years) memorized auditory or visual stimuli <b>presented</b> <b>with</b> a semantically congruent, incongruent or non-semantic stimulus in the other modality during encoding. Subsequent recognition memory performance was better for auditory or visual stimuli initially <b>presented</b> together <b>with</b> a semantically congruent stimulus in the other modality than for stimuli accompanied by a non-semantic stimulus in the other modality. This congruency effect was observed for pictures <b>presented</b> <b>with</b> sounds, for sounds <b>presented</b> <b>with</b> pictures, for spoken words <b>presented</b> <b>with</b> pictures and for written words <b>presented</b> <b>with</b> spoken words. The present results show that semantically congruent multisensory experiences during encoding can improve memory performance in school-aged children...|$|R
