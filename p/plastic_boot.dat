A <b>plastic</b> <b>boot</b> {{on the end of the}} auger protects the finish of the visible porcelain. Since most toilet clogs occur in the trap built into the bowl, the short cable is sufficient to break up or retrieve the greater majority of clogs.|$|E

A <b>plastic</b> <b>boot</b> is normally used for strain relief and protection from moisture. Use of a breakout kit enables a fiber-optic cable containing multiple loose buffer tubes to receive connectors without the splicing of pigtails.|$|E

5000|$|Rosemount's first {{production}} run of 900 prototype boots {{was sent to}} the ski shops in 1965/66. By this point, Bob Lange had already shipped a number of boots made of [...] "Royalite" [...] ABS plastic; these were not very successful, but do they pre-date the Rosemount examples as the earliest <b>plastic</b> <b>boots.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For {{much of the}} 1980s {{and into}} the 1990s, inline skate models {{typically}} sold for general public use employed a hard <b>plastic</b> <b>boot,</b> similar to ski boots. In or about 1995, [...] "soft boot" [...] designs {{were introduced to the}} market, primarily by the sporting goods firm K2 Inc., and promoted for use as fitness skates. Other companies quickly followed, and by the early 2000s the development of hard shell skates and skeletons became primarily limited to the Aggressive inline skating discipline and other specialized designs.|$|E
50|$|By this time, Rosemount Engineering had {{introduced}} their own all-synthetic boot. Unlike the Lange, the Rosemount design {{was made of}} rigid fiberglass and split open in two parts to put it on. Like Lange, they were only able to produce small numbers of boots, about 900 pair, for the 1965/66 season. Many sources make the claim that Rosemount was first to introduce a <b>plastic</b> <b>boot</b> commercially, {{but it appears that}} both were available in limited numbers at the same time. In any event, Lange's earlier Royalite models clearly pre-date any of the Rosemount examples.|$|E
50|$|Inexpensive skates for {{recreational}} skaters usually resemble either figure skates or hockey skates, but recreational ice skates resembling inline skates with a molded <b>plastic</b> <b>boot</b> are also available. These recreational skates are commonly rented from ice rinks by beginners {{who do not}} own their own skates. In the non-American English-speaking world they are sometimes called 'death wellies' by skaters who own their own equipment because of their appearance and their reputation for giving the wearer blisters. People who own their own skates may further {{reduce the risk of}} blisters by adding a friction management patch to areas inside the skate that could rub or chafe.|$|E

50|$|Alden Hanson of Dow Chemical {{contacted}} Lange in 1970 to {{tell them}} about a new material the company had invented. The new plastic retained a putty-like texture in any weather, and Hanson's son had used it to make boots with a layer of the material sandwiched between a normal leather boot and a hard fiberglass shell. The material was a natural fit with Lange's <b>plastic</b> <b>boots,</b> fitting between the liner and shell.|$|R
50|$|The {{widespread}} {{introduction of}} <b>plastic</b> <b>boots</b> in the 1970s changed the market considerably. Now the required attachment points for toe-and-heel bindings could be moulded {{right into the}} boot, eliminating the problems when users screwed on their own attachments. These entered a market in the 1970s where plate-type bindings, including Spademan, held roughly half the binding market. In 1978 Spademan had excellent sales and {{was by far the}} best selling US binding design.|$|R

They also manufacture skate boots, inline skates, blade benders, sharpening jigs, sharpening stones, de-burring tools, backpacks, helmets, blade covers, and laces. Since the introduction of Maple Gold in 1996, Maple has increased their range of skates and boots to cater to all levels of skaters, in hopes of dominating the worldwide speed skate market.Maple has been growing ever since its creation, and that growth was only increased when eight out of eight Olympic Short Track speed skating gold medalists and five out of 12 Long Track gold medalist choose to use Maple skates in the Turin 2006 Winter Olympics.|$|E
50|$|Although randonn√©e is {{considered}} as an alpine sport, it basically combines the cross-country stride for uphill portions and then conventional alpine techniques on the downhill. The equipment uses most closely compares to modern telemark systems, {{with a stiff}} <b>plastic</b> <b>boot</b> offering good downhill control, and a binding system that allows it to pivot at the toe for cross-country striding. Different models trade off light weight against downhill performance. They have a rockered, rubber sole to allow for easier walking. This means {{that they will not}} fit in ordinary alpine bindings. Instead, the interface between Alpine Touring boots and bindings is defined by ISO 9523. Other attachment methods exist and prominent amongst these are the Tech bindings and fittings that were first commercialized by Dynafit as the TLT. As yet, these are not covered by an international standard.|$|E
50|$|Beginning around 1960 Bob Lange {{experimented with}} ways to replace leather with plastic. Early {{examples}} used a lace-up design, but in 1964 he combined a new, more flexible polyurethane plastic with the overlapping flap and buckle system from Henke to produce the first recognizably modern ski boot. Production examples appeared in 1966, and when Nancy Greene started winning races on them, the <b>plastic</b> <b>boot</b> became a must-have item. Replacing leather with plastic dramatically improved stiffness and control, along with durability and warmth (leather boots {{had a way of}} soaking through, which led to wet, frozen feet). Over time the cuff around the leg evolved upward, starting just over the ankle like leather boots, but rising to a point about half way to the knee by the 1980s. Only minor changes have occurred to this basic design since then.|$|E

50|$|Early <b>plastic</b> <b>boots,</b> {{like their}} earlier leather cousins, rose {{just above the}} ankle and {{provided}} little support if the skier leaned forward or back. Around 1966 the French developed a new short-turn technique called avalement that stored energy by bending {{the tail of the}} ski and then using this to accelerate out of turns. This required the skier to lean back on the skis, and to support this style, skiers took to adding any number of ad-hoc solutions to add support at the back.|$|R
50|$|Futuristic {{clothing}} {{is a particular}} imagined vision of the clothing that might be worn in the distant future, typically found in science fiction and science fiction films of the 1940s onwards, but also in journalism and other popular culture. The garments envisioned have most commonly been either one-piece garments, skin-tight garments, or both, typically ending up looking like either overalls or leotards, often worn together with <b>plastic</b> <b>boots.</b> In many cases, there is an assumption that the clothing {{of the future will}} be highly uniform.|$|R

5000|$|During the 1970-1971 season, Jack Nagel {{introduced}} the [...] "Jet-Stix", an aftermarket accessory {{designed to be}} used on <b>plastic</b> <b>boots</b> from Lange or Rosemont. The Jet-Stix consisted of a fiberglass extension shaped like a shoehorn that strapped on under the top buckle so it lay {{along the back of}} the calf. These allowed the skier to lean back and raise the front of the ski upward with ease. Lange quickly followed with their own version, the Lange Spoiler. Similar devices were common through 1970.|$|R
5000|$|Parallel turns require solid contact {{from the}} skier's lower leg to the ski to rotate it on-edge. This was {{difficult}} to achieve with early ski equipment, limiting the technique to the high performance realm of racing. The introduction of composite skis, metal edges, releasable clamping bindings, and stiff <b>plastic</b> <b>boots</b> combined to allow parallel turns even on beginner equipment. By the late 1960s it rapidly replaced stemming for all but very short-radius turns. The evolution of shaped skis in the 1990s advanced the carving turn to preeminence.|$|R

5000|$|Ski {{bindings}} {{evolved from}} the cable binding system of the 1950s, which looped around behind the boot and {{over the back of}} the sole. Many boots of the 1950s and 60s included a semi-circular indentation in the sole to provide a better fit for the cable. Early releasing bindings were designed to fit into this groove or over the sole, like a cable, often using a metal roller about the same size as the cable, the Look Nevada's [...] "Gran Prix" [...] release heel being a typical example. When <b>plastic</b> <b>boots</b> were introduced, they too provided similar sole extensions for mounting the bindings.|$|R
50|$|Telemark {{refers to}} a {{specific}} technique for making downhill turns on Nordic equipment. This has resulted in highly specialized equipment designed for better performance in a downhill setting. Until 1992 Telemark boots were basically heavy leather boots with {{the front of the}} sole adapted to the 75mm Nordic Norm. The introduction of the New Telemark Norm (NTN) binding in 2007 change the technique dramatically. Since then <b>plastic</b> <b>boots</b> have become more and more common and now make up almost all Telemark <b>boots.</b> <b>Plastic</b> allows for a laterally stiffer boot while still allowing freedom of flex at the ball of the foot through the use of bellows. Boots intended for more cross country travel generally have a lower cuff, softer flex and lighter weight. Boots specialized for downhill use have higher cuffs, stiffer flex and heavier weight. Telemark boots are almost always equipped with a rubber sole.|$|R

40|$|Four {{intervention}} strategies were tested {{for their ability}} to prevent the mechanical transmission of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) : the use of disposable <b>plastic</b> <b>boots</b> to prevent contamination of personal footwear, the use of boot baths to disinfect PRRSV-contaminated <b>plastic</b> <b>boots,</b> the use of plastic slatted (Polygrate) flooring in the anteroom to prevent PRRSV contamination of incoming personal footwear, and the use of bag-in-a-box shipping methods to prevent PRRSV contamination of the contents of a container destined for a swine farm. Ten PRRSV-positive replicates and 10 PRRSV-negative (sham-inoculated) replicates were used for each strategy. Swabs were collected from selected sites and tested by TaqMan polymerase chain reaction for PRRSV RNA and by swine bioassay to confirm the presence of infectious PRRSV. Results indicated that the use of disposable boots, bleach boot baths or bag-in-a-box shipping methods was highly efficacious in preventing mechanical transmission of PRRSV. In contrast, the use of Polygrate flooring in the anteroom did not prevent contamination of personal footwear. The numbers of PRRSV-positive samples from the Polygrate surface and the soles of incoming footwear placed directly on the Polygrate surface were not significantly different (P = 0. 24) from those of footwear that directly contacted the floor of the contaminated anteroom. Although these results are promising, this study should be considered a pilot project and the {{intervention strategies}} not considered biosecurity protocols. The model used may or may not represent field conditions. Therefore, the information should be used to develop larger experimental studies, with sufficient statistical power, in combination with field-based epidemiologic studies to better assess the role of mechanical transmission of PRRSV under field conditions...|$|R
5000|$|Rising hemlines and the {{availability}} of new, brightly colored artificial materials such as PVC, combined to make boots an attractive fashion option for younger women. In 1965 Andr√© Courr√®ges released the first of his iconic white leather calf-length boots and designers such as Mary Quant, who launched her own [...] "Quant Afoot" [...] line of footwear in 1967, produced inexpensive, machine-molded <b>plastic</b> <b>boots</b> in a variety of different colors to be worn in tandem with miniskirts. The rising price of leather during the 1960s made these <b>plastic</b> and vinyl <b>boots</b> a popular alternative to more traditional footwear. As skirts became even shorter in the late 1960s, there was a resurgence of interest in thigh-length boots or cuissardes. Pierre Cardin featured shiny black PVC thighboots as part of his futuristic 1968 couture collection and Beth Levine designed seamless, stretch vinyl and nylon stocking boots tall enough to do double duty as hosiery. The tallest boots from this period were so high that they were equipped with suspenders to hold them up. High laced boots, similar to those worn in Edwardian times, were also popular.|$|R
5000|$|A {{dramatically}} improved {{model was}} being introduced for the winter, the S-2/S-3/S-4 lineup, that greatly increased [...] "free travel" [...] within the binding {{in order to}} prevent pre-release. Betting on large sales, Spademan moved the factory from San Francisco to Lake Tahoe. The bindings were made of cast aluminum, and the moulds were delivered months late. Both of these changes conspired to slow production, and many shops did not receive stock until well into the season. Sales plummeted, and the rapid take up of toe-and-heel bindings for the now universal <b>plastic</b> <b>boots</b> meant they never recovered. The S-9 model introduced true step-in-step out performance, but by the time of its release sales were moribund. Spademan eventually returned to practicing medicine.|$|R

5000|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>plastic</b> <b>boots</b> in the 1960s led {{a number of}} companies to introduce [...] "hybrid" [...] <b>boots</b> with <b>plastic</b> inserts for additional lateral strength. These were widespread in the late 1960s, especially from the large collection of Italian bookmakers in Montebelluna, before they started introducing all-plastic designs of their own. Typical designs used a plastic insert wrapping around the heel area and extending up to just below the ankle, allowing the skier to force their foot sideways and offering some edging control. Others, notably 1968's Raichle Fibre Jet, wrapped a soft leather boot in an external fibreglass shell, producing a side-entry design that was not particularly successful. Hybrid designs often incorporated elements of the side-entry or three-piece designs. The Fibre Jet shared much in common with the Rosemount design, for instance.|$|R

50|$|Luensmann used {{strips of}} the {{material}} in a heat press to melt them into a single shell. He handed the results to Lange the next year, {{in the summer of}} 1961. After trying them that winter, Lange asked Luensmann to join him in a new company dedicated to making <b>plastic</b> <b>boots.</b> For mass production, the two built a vacuum press to shape the cuffs from larger sections of Royalite. This produced an extremely stiff boot suitable only for the most powerful racers. Attempting to solve the problem, they struck on the solution of molding the boot in two separate parts and joining them through rivets on either side, {{at the level of the}} ankle. This allowed the boot to retain all the lateral stiffness of the original design, while allowing the forward flex to be better controlled.|$|R
