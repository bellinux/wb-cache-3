To understand the impact of reservoir sanding on <b>perforated</b> <b>casing</b> strength, fracture mechanics is applied to analyze the {{stress concentration}} of <b>casing</b> caused by <b>perforating,</b> while rock mechanics is applied to analyze the load of <b>perforated</b> <b>casing</b> of reservoir sanding limited bailed section, and on this basis, the impact of reservoir sanding on <b>perforated</b> <b>casing</b> strength is analyzed by the three-dimensional finite element model building. The analysis {{results show that the}} finite element solution and the theoretical solution of stresses of the <b>perforated</b> <b>casing</b> of reservoir sanding limited bailed section can be verified with each other. Under the same condition, the theoretical solution is bigger than the finite element solution, this is mainly due to the <b>perforated</b> <b>casing</b> additional bending stress effect is considered in the fracture mechanics theoretical analysis. It is conservative to estimate the <b>perforated</b> <b>casing</b> safety by finite element solution, while the theoretical solution is economical...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of pore fluid flow on the elastic and plastic stresses in a porous material may be determined for a solid body containing a large spherical or cylindrical cavity. A {{description of the}} stresses in porous media relies on a separation of the total stress into effective and neutral parts. In the elastic case, the effective stress {{is that part of}} the total stress that determines the deformation of the porous solid. The application of Drucker's postulate to a mixture of a solid and a fluid under homogeneous deformation results in a plastic flow rule written in terms of the total stress. The elastic or plastic state of stress in the porous solid surrounding a spherical or cylindrical cavity is significantly affected by a nonuniform pore pressure distribution. For a plastic material obeying a quadratic yield condition, pore fluid flow into a spherical cavity reduces the mean compressive stress in the solid and may lead to cavity expansion. For an elastic material, pore fluid flow into a cylindrical cavity may initiate yielding in the porous solid at an unsupported, fully supported, or partially supported cavity boundary. Application of these analyses to the rock surrounding a <b>perforated</b> <b>casing</b> in a hydrocarbon reservoir gives an estimate for the well pressures that precipitate initial yielding and the production of solid material. Several other problems related to the behavior of rock around a <b>perforated</b> <b>casing</b> may be investigated using elasticity, plasticity, and potential flow theory. An elastic porous cylinder under uniform overburden loading represents more closely the physical boundary conditions in a reservoir than the conventional plane strain analysis. Mechanical loads required for the extrusion of a porous solid are significantly reduced by simultaneous pore fluid flow through the extruded material. Finally conformal mapping provides a simple approximate description of the pore pressure distribution around a slotted casing...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} aspect of the risk associated with geological carbon dioxide sequestration is the integrity of existing wellbores that penetrate geological layers targeted for CO 2 injection. CO 2 leakage may occur through multiple pathways along a wellbore within the “disturbed zone” surrounding the <b>well</b> <b>casing.</b> The disturbed zone is defined as the annular region along the exterior of the steel wellbore casing that includes the Portland cement sheath, the damage zone of the host rock and the casing-cement-rock interfaces. The effective permeability of this zone is a key parameter of wellbore integrity required for validation of numerical models. Effective permeability may depend on a number of complex factors, including long-term attack by aggressive fluids, poor well completion or actions related to production of fluids through the wellbore. Field tests are essential to understanding the in situ leakage properties of the millions of wells that exist in mature sedimentary basins in North America. We present results from recent field studies of different CO 2 producing wells from both natural CO 2 reservoirs and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations. These surveys have included a particular downhole pressure test, the vertical interference test (VIT), designed {{to determine the extent of}} hydraulic communication along the exterior of the <b>well</b> <b>casing.</b> The VIT test involves <b>perforating</b> the <b>well</b> <b>casing</b> in two separate intervals, both of which are located within the shale caprock and bracket a zone of cement identified to have a lower quality bond. Once the intervals are isolated with an inflatable packer, the system is pressurized from surface and held at a constant pressure, while simultaneously, the transient pressure response is measured in the lower isolated interval. The pressure transient data is an indicator of the extent of hydraulic communication and is the focus of subsequent analysis. The effective wellbore permeability can be determined through numerical analysis of the VIT data. Our objective is to identify to most effective method of analysis for estimating wellbore permeability. We evaluate two different automated parameter estimation methods, nonlinear regression and shuffled complex evolution metropolis methods. Within this study, we also estimate parameters such as permeability and compressibility of the low permeability shale zone to determine their effect on the resulting estimate of wellbore permeability. The results of this work demonstrate that parameter estimation can be effective at identifying the key parameters associated with wellbore integrity from VIT field tests, and ultimately reducing the uncertainty regarding the integrity of existing wellbores...|$|R

50|$|The {{location}} {{of one or}} more fractures {{along the length of the}} borehole is strictly controlled by various methods that create or seal holes in the side of the wellbore.

40|$|SummaryDrywells are gravity-fed, {{excavated}} pits with <b>perforated</b> <b>casings</b> used {{to facilitate}} stormwater infiltration and groundwater recharge {{in areas where}} drainage and diversion of storm flows is problematic. Historically, drywells have predominantly {{been used as a}} form of stormwater management in locations that receive high volumes of precipitation; however the use of drywells is increasingly being evaluated as a method to supplement groundwater recharge, especially in areas facing severe drought. Studies have shown that drywells can be an effective means to increase recharge to aquifers; however, the potential for groundwater contamination caused by polluted stormwater runoff bypassing transport through surface soil and near surface sediment has prevented more widespread use of drywells as a recharge mechanism. Numerous studies have shown that groundwater and drinking water contamination from drywells can be avoided if drywells are used in appropriate locations and properly maintained. The effectiveness of drywells for aquifer recharge depends on the hydrogeologic setting and land use surrounding a site, as well as influent stormwater quantity and quality. These parameters may be informed for a specific drywell site through geologic and hydrologic characterization and adequate monitoring of stormwater and groundwater quality...|$|R

The investigation shows that the American Petroleum Institution Bulletin 5 C 3 (API 5 C 3) standards solutions are the most conservative whereas the International Organisation for Standardization Technical Report 10400 (ISO 10400) recommendations were of Klever-Tomano Collapse Theory and Klever-Steward Burst Theory which are more comparable to the true collapse and burst failures...|$|R

Hydraulic Fracture Technology (HFT), {{a joint venture}} between SCT Operations Pty Ltd and CSIRO Petroleum, is working with Illawarra Coal to develop the capability to enhance gas drainage rates in the Bulli Seam using sand-propped hydraulic fracturing based on HFT’s experience at Dartbrook Mine where gas drainage rates were increased by 5 to 180 times. One of the principal challenges for implementing sand-propped hydraulic fracturing in the Bulli Seam is the high vertical stresses that cause borehole breakout in horizontal holes drilled in coal. Borehole breakout effectively precludes the use of open hole straddle packers which are a convenient tool for placing multiple sand-propped hydraulic fractures in in-seam holes. Results of an initial six week trial undertaken at Douglas Project pit-bottom are described, which is aimed to developing the capability to install, grout and <b>perforate</b> <b>casing</b> so that straddle packers can be used for sand-propped hydraulic fracturing in overstressed boreholes. The primary goals of the pitbottom trial at Douglas were to confirm that horizontal boreholes in Bulli coal at 500 m overburden depth are overstressed and unsuitable for use of open hole straddle packers, and to establish a method for installing, cementing and slotting casing so that straddle packers can be used to place hydraulic fractures.

40|$|Predicting sand {{production}} accurately is {{a difficult}} task; many techniques have been previously investigated such as production history, mechanical property analysis using electrical log data, laboratory testing and computer modeling. In this study, the mechanism of sand production problem in an oil reservoir producing medium oil (30 o API) from a weak sandstone formation was investigated. An analytical model is elaborated based on linear-poroelastic solution of stress state around circular openings as well as Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion and Darcy’s equations for fluid flow through porous media in vertical and horizontal wellbores. In this study, a new important factor necessary for the estimation of the mount of free sand generated between sheared planes caused by the fluid drawdown was introduced. This factor is called sand production capability factor. Sand capability factor was evaluated experimentally for the studied reservoir. Observations of sand production in the studied oil reservoirere utilized to tune and verify the model used in this study. For open-hole completion, it was found that; free sand ready {{to move into the}} wellbore is inversely proportional to radial distance. Furthermore, free sand ready for production from the yielded zone around vertical wells is higher than {{that in the case of}} horizontal wells. The predicted free sand in all studied cases is in accordance with field observations. Selection of borehole and perforation orientation (in case of <b>perforated</b> <b>casing</b> completion) with respect to the maximum horizontal principal in-situ stress has a great effect in reducing the potential free sand amounts ready to move into the wellbore along with the producing reservoir fluids.
