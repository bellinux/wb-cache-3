25|$|Upon {{activation}} (in platelets) {{or injury}} (in erythrocytes, platelets, endothelium, and other cells), certain cells expose the phospholipid phosphatidylserine on their surface {{and act as}} catalysts to induce the coagulation cascade. Surface exposure of phosphatidylserine {{is thought to be}} brought about by the activation of scramblases. Several enzyme complexes of blood coagulation cascade such as tenase and <b>prothrombinase</b> are activated by the cell surface exposure of the phosphatidylserine. However, the most studied member of the scramblase family PLSCR1 was shown to be defective in translocation of phospholipids when reconstituted into proteoliposomes in vitro. Although recent studies show that PLSCR1 is neither sufficient nor necessary for the phosphatidylserine externalization, the involvement of PLSCR1 in blood coagulation remains elusive, raising the question of additional membrane components in the externalization pathway.

Inhibition of Factor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting both thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin (activated Factor II), and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. It allows predictable anticoagulation and dose adjustments and routine coagulation monitoring [...] as well as dietary restrictions are not needed.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>prothrombinase</b> complex {{consists}} of the serine protein, Factor Xa, and the protein cofactor, Factor Va. The complex assembles on negatively charged phospholipid membranes {{in the presence of}} calcium ions. The <b>prothrombinase</b> complex catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin (Factor II), an inactive zymogen, to thrombin (Factor IIa), an active serine protease. The activation of thrombin is a critical reaction in the coagulation cascade, which functions to regulate hemostasis in the body. To produce thrombin, the <b>prothrombinase</b> complex cleaves two peptide bonds in prothrombin, one after Arg271 and the other after Arg320. [...] Although {{it has been shown that}} Factor Xa can activate prothrombin when unassociated with the <b>prothrombinase</b> complex, the rate of thrombin formation is severely decreased under such circumstances. The <b>prothrombinase</b> complex can catalyze the activation of prothrombin at a rate 3 x 105-fold faster than can Factor Xa alone. Thus, the <b>prothrombinase</b> complex is required for the efficient production of activated thrombin and also for adequate hemostasis.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Prothrombinase</b> {{assembly}} {{begins with}} the binding of Factor Xa and Factor Va to negatively charged phospholipids on plasma membranes. Activated Factor Xa and Factor Va bind to the plasma membranes {{of a variety of}} different cell types, including monocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells. Both Factor Xa and Va bind to the membrane independently of each other, but they both bind to mutually exclusive binding sites. Both Factor Xa and Factor Va associate with the membrane via their light chains, with Factor Xa binding via its Gla-domain in a calcium-dependent manner and Factor Va via its C2 and C1 domains. Once bound to the plasma membrane, Factor Xa and Factor Va rapidly associate in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio to form the <b>prothrombinase</b> complex. [...] Assembly of the <b>prothrombinase</b> complex is calcium dependent. When associated with the <b>prothrombinase</b> complex, the catalytic efficiency of Factor Xa is increased 300,000-fold compared to its efficiency alone. Factor Xa and Factor Va interact tightly with each other when associated on the plasma membrane. Further, membrane-bound Factor Va provides a strong catalytic advantage to the <b>prothrombinase</b> complex. Factor Va strengthens the affinity of Factor Xa for the membrane and also increases the kcat of Factor Xa for prothrombin. Factor Va also decreases the Km of the reaction by enhancing the binding of prothrombin to the <b>prothrombinase</b> complex.|$|E

50|$|Membrane bound FGL2 (mFGL2) {{exhibits}} a <b>prothrombinase</b> activity, resulting in fibrin deposition, vascular thrombosis and tissue inflammation within an affected tissue, largely {{contributing to the}} innate arm of immunity. Through mFGL2’s actions of promoting vascular thrombosis and tissue inflammation, it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of viral-induced fulminant hepatitis in acute hepatitis B infections. Hepatocellular necrosis ensues rapidly, due to the HBV nucleocapsid protein’s ability to markedly upregulate expression of the mFGL2 <b>prothrombinase,</b> leading to fibrin deposition within the vasculature networks that supply blood to the liver.|$|E
5000|$|In stage 3, {{thrombin}} generation, Factor XIa activates free Factor IX on {{the surface}} of activated platelets. The activated Factor IXa with Factor VIIIa forms the [...] "tenase" [...] complex. This [...] "tenase" [...] complex activates more Factor X, which in turn forms new <b>prothrombinase</b> complexes with Factor Va. Factor Xa is the prime component of the <b>prothrombinase</b> complex which converts large amounts of prothrombin—the [...] "thrombin burst". Each molecule of Factor Xa can generate 1000 molecules of thrombin. This large burst of thrombin is responsible for fibrin polymerization to form a thrombus.|$|E
50|$|It acts by {{cleaving}} prothrombin in {{two places}} (an arg-thr and then an arg-ile bond), which yields the active thrombin. This process is optimized when factor Xa is complexed with activated co-factor V in the <b>prothrombinase</b> complex.|$|E
50|$|Rivaroxaban and Apixaban bind to {{the active}} site of Factor Xa, {{regardless}} of whether Factor Xa is bound in the <b>prothrombinase</b> complex or is in its free form. These direct Factor Xa inhibitors can be administered orally, as can dabigatran etexilate which is a direct thrombin inhibitor.|$|E
5000|$|Deficiencies {{of either}} protein {{components}} of the <b>prothrombinase</b> complex are very rare. Factor V deficiency, also called parahemophilia, is a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder with an approximate incidence of 1 in 1,000,000. [...] Congenital Factor X deficiency is also extremely rare, affecting an estimated 1 in 1,000,000.|$|E
50|$|Normally when a {{vascular}} injury occurs, platelets are activated and phosphatidylserine (PS) {{in the inner}} leaflet of the platelet membrane is transported to the outer leaflet of the platelet membrane, where it provides a binding site for plasma protein complexes {{that are involved in}} the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, such as factor VIIIa-IXa (tenase) and factor Va-Xa (<b>prothrombinase).</b>|$|E
50|$|Calcium and {{phospholipid}} (a platelet membrane constituent) {{are required}} for the tenase and <b>prothrombinase</b> complexes to function. Calcium mediates the binding of the complexes via the terminal gamma-carboxy residues on FXa and FIXa to the phospholipid surfaces expressed by platelets, as well as procoagulant microparticles or microvesicles shed from them. Calcium is also required at other points in the coagulation cascade.|$|E
50|$|The fully {{assembled}} <b>prothrombinase</b> complex catalyzes {{the conversion}} of the zymogen prothrombin to the serine protease thrombin. Specifically, Factor Xa cleaves prothrombin in two locations, following Arg271 and Arg320 in human prothrombin. Because there are two cleavage events, prothrombin activation can proceed by two pathways. In one pathway, prothrombin is first cleaved at Arg271. This cleavage produces Fragment 1•2, comprising the first 271 residues, and the intermediate prethrombin 2, which is made up of residues 272-579. Fragment 1•2 is released as an activation peptide, and prethrombin 2 is cleaved at Arg320, yielding active thrombin. The two chains formed after the cleavage at Arg320, termed the A and B chains, are linked by a disulfide bond in active thrombin. In the alternate pathway for thrombin activation, prothrombin is first cleaved at Arg320, producing a catalytically active intermediate called meizothrombin. Meizothrombin contains fragment 1•2 A chain linked to the B chain by a disulfide bond. Subsequent cleavage of meizothrombin by Factor Xa at Arg271 gives Fragment 1•2 and active thrombin, consisting of the A and B chains linked by a disulfide bond. When thrombin is generated by Factor Xa alone, the first pathway predominates and prothrombin is first cleaved after Arg271, producing prethrombin 2, which is subsequently cleaved after Arg320. If Factor Xa acts as a component of the <b>prothrombinase</b> complex, however, the second pathway is favored, and prothrombin is first cleaved after Arg320, producing meizothrombin, which is cleaved after Arg271 to produce active thrombin. Thus, the formation of the <b>prothrombinase</b> complex alters the sequence of prothrombin bond cleavage.|$|E

5000|$|In stage 1, Factor VII binds to the {{transmembrane protein}} TF {{on the surface}} of cells and is {{converted}} to Factor VIIa. The result is a Factor VIIa/TF complex which catalyzes the activation of Factor X and Factor IX.

50|$|Recently a {{new series}} of specific, direct acting inhibitors of Factor Xa has been developed. These include the drugs rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, LY517717, darexaban (YM150), {{edoxaban}} and 813893. These agents have several theoretical advantages over current therapy. They may be given orally. They have rapid onset of action. And they may be more effective against Factor Xa in that they inhibit both free Factor Xa and Factor Xa in the <b>prothrombinase</b> complex.|$|E
5000|$|Factor X is part {{of fresh}} frozen plasma and the <b>prothrombinase</b> complex.

50|$|Factor V {{is able to}} bind to {{activated}} platelets and {{is activated}} by thrombin. On activation, factor V is spliced in two chains (heavy and light chain with molecular masses of 110000 and 73000, respectively) which are noncovalently bound to each other by calcium. The thereby activated factor V (now called FVa) is a cofactor of the <b>prothrombinase</b> complex: The activated factor X (FXa) enzyme requires calcium and activated factor V to convert prothrombin to thrombin on the cell surface membrane.|$|E
5000|$|Apo-H {{appears to}} {{completely}} inhibit serotonin release by the platelets and prevents subsequent {{waves of the}} ADP-induced aggregation. The activity of Apo-H appears to involve the binding of agglutinating, negatively charged compounds, and inhibits agglutination by the contact activation of the intrinsic blood coagulation pathway. [...] Apo-H causes a reduction of the <b>prothrombinase</b> binding sites on platelets and reduces the activation caused by collagen when thrombin is present at physiological serum concentrations of Apo-H suggesting a regulatory role of Apo-H in coagulation.|$|E

50|$|A {{key event}} {{in the final stages}} of blood {{coagulation}} is the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin by the serine protease enzyme thrombin. Thrombin is produced from prothrombin, by the action of an enzyme, <b>prothrombinase</b> (Factor Xa along with Factor Va as a cofactor), in the final states of coagulation. Fibrin is then cross linked by factor XIII (Fibrin Stabilizing Factor) to form a blood clot. The principal inhibitor of thrombin in normal blood circulation is antithrombin. Similar to antithrombin, the anticoagulatant activity of hirudin is based on its ability to inhibit the procoagulant activity of thrombin.|$|E
50|$|Protein C {{is a major}} {{component}} in anticoagulation in the human body. It acts as a serine protease zymogen: APC proteolyses peptide bonds in activated Factor V and Factor VIII (Factor Va and Factor VIIIa), {{and one of the}} amino acids in the bond is serine. These proteins that APC inactivates, Factor Va and Factor VIIIa, are highly procoagulant cofactors in the generation of thrombin, which is a crucial element in blood clotting; together {{they are part of the}} <b>prothrombinase</b> complex. Cofactors in the inactivation of Factor Va and Factor VIIIa include protein S, Factor V, high-density lipoprotein, anionic phospholipids and glycosphingolipids.|$|E
50|$|Thrombin is {{produced}} by the enzymatic cleavage of two sites on prothrombin by activated Factor X (Xa). The activity of factor Xa is greatly enhanced by binding to activated Factor V (Va), termed the <b>prothrombinase</b> complex. Prothrombin {{is produced}} in the liver and is co-translationally modified in a vitamin K-dependent reaction that converts 10-12 glutamic acids in the N terminus of the molecule to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla). In the presence of calcium, the Gla residues promote the binding of prothrombin to phospholipid bilayers. Deficiency of vitamin K or administration of the anticoagulant warfarin inhibits the production of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues, slowing the activation of the coagulation cascade.|$|E

40|$|The {{independent}} {{effect of}} protein S as <b>prothrombinase</b> inhibitor {{has been proposed}} to depend on binding to both coagulation factors Va and factor Xa or on the binding to phospholipid thereby limiting the phospholipid available for <b>prothrombinase</b> activity. In this study we show that plasma concentrations of protein S (300 nM) equilibrated with the <b>prothrombinase</b> components (factor Va, factor Xa, phospholipid) cause a profound inhibition at low phospholipid concentrations (approximately 0. 2 microM). This inhibition by protein S of <b>prothrombinase</b> activity is abrogated with increasing phospholipid concentrations. Modeling {{of the effect of}} protein S on <b>prothrombinase</b> based only on the reported affinity of protein S for phospholipids (Kd approximately 10 (- 8) M) in an equilibrium model (Clotspeed), predicted the experimentally obtained thrombin generation rates at low phospholipid in the presence of protein S based on the diminished available phospholipid binding sites for the <b>prothrombinase</b> components. Consistently, initial rates of <b>prothrombinase</b> activity are already maximally inhibited when protein S is preincubated with the phospholipid prior to the addition of factor Xa, factor Va and prothrombin. The results indicate that the order of addition of <b>prothrombinase</b> components and the availability of phospholipid may have a profound influence on observed effects of protein S on <b>prothrombinase</b> activity. All <b>prothrombinase</b> components (factor Xa, factor Va, phospholipid) become available {{during the course of the}} physiological thrombin generation. The effect of protein S was therefore studied on tissue factor-induced, platelet-dependent thrombin generation. Protein S delayed and inhibited the rate of thrombin generation of tissue factor-induced thrombin formation when surface is provided at physiologic concentrations using isolated platelets (2 x 10 (8) /ml). In contrast, protein S hardly affected thrombin generation in this model when platelets were pre-activated with collagen. Furthermore, the observed effects of addition of protein C and thrombomodulin in the absence or presence of protein S on tissue factor-induced, platelet-dependent thrombin generation, indicate that protein S and protein C may cooperate in the regulation of <b>prothrombinase</b> activity through independent mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The {{activation}} of prothrombin by <b>prothrombinase</b> was investi-gated {{in a continuous}} flow system at 25 "C.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{kinetics}} of {{inhibition of}} <b>prothrombinase</b> during prothrombin conversion by antithrombin and antithrombin-heparin complexes was studied in a tubular flow reactor. <b>Prothrombinase</b> was assembled at a macroscopic phospholipid membrane, composed of 25 mol % phosphatidylserine and 75 mol % phosphatidylcholine, deposited {{on the inner}} wall of a glass capillary, by perfusion with a factor Xa-factor Va mixture. Measurement of thrombin production allowed estimation {{of the amount of}} <b>prothrombinase</b> present at the capillary wall. Perfusion with a mixture of prothrombin and antithrombin or antithrombin-heparin complexes caused a progressive decline of the <b>prothrombinase</b> activity. The rate of inactivation steeply decreased with increasing prothrombin concentrations, indicating competitive inhibition. Analysis of competitive inhibition data requires estimation of the time-dependent substrate concentration, C,, near the prothrombin converting surface using earlier developed transport theory [Billy, D., et al. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 1029 - 10341. It appears that the inhibition rate is proportional to the fraction of enzyme, K,/(Km-I- C,), not occupied by substrate. The value of K, of <b>prothrombinase</b> estimated from the dependence of the inhibition rate on the prothrombin concentration (K, = 2 - 3 nM) is in excellent agreement with the value estimated from the substrate conversion rate (K, = 3 nM).
