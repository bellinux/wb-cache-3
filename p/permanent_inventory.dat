However, the realism and correct interpretation of such projections {{has been the subject of}} considerable discussion. Here, we investigate whether climate suitability predictions correlate to tree growth, measured in <b>permanent</b> <b>inventory</b> plots and inferred from tree-ring records. We use the ensemble classifier RandomForest and species occurrence data from ~ 200, 000 inventory plots to build species distribution models for four important European forestry species: Norway spruce, Scots pine, European beech, and pedunculate oak. We then correlate climate-based habitat suitability with volume measurements from ~ 50 -year-old stands, available from ~ 11, 000 inventory plots. Secondly, habitat projections based on annual historical climate are compared with ring width from ~ 300 tree-ring chronologies. Our working hypothesis is that habitat suitability projections from species distribution models should to some degree be associated with temporal or spatial variation in these growth records. We find that the habitat projections are uncorrelated with spatial growth records (inventory plot data), but they do predict interannual variation in tree-ring width, with an average correlation of. 22. Correlation coefficients for individual chronologies range from values as high as. 82 or as low as −. 31. We conclude that tree responses to projected climate change are highly site-specific and that local suitability of a species for reforestation is difficult to predict. That said, projected increase or decrease in climatic suitability may be interpreted as an average expectation of increased or reduced growth over larger geographic scales. <br/...|$|E

Do soil conditions and land-use history explain the variation in vegetation dynamics? Is there evidence for alternative stable states? Location: NOrholm hede, a 350 -ha heathland in southwest Denmark that was abandoned in 1895 and left to develop naturally via succession. Methods: <b>Permanent</b> vegetation <b>inventory</b> plots were established and have been revisited 11 times between 1921 and 2012. Soil conditions were recorded in 2012. We used clustering, linear mixed models, linear models, ANOVA and multivariate techniques (redundancy analysis and principal response curves) to investigate changes in the plant community and how differences in plant community composition related to soil conditions and disturbance history. Results: Ericaceous dwarf shrubs dominated most of the heathland initially. A dominance shift from dwarf shrubs to grasses occurred on about half of the plots. The other half of the plots remained dominated by dwarf shrubs, although Empetrum nigrum expanded at the expense of Calluna vulgaris. Lichen cover decreased dramatically across all plots. The divergent successional pattern was not explained by nutrient concentrations. Grasses mainly expanded in areas where they already had a substantial presence, and this initial presence was largely correlated with historical soil disturbance. Plots where dwarf shrubs remained dominant had a relatively thick O-horizon. Conclusions: Vegetation dynamics during heathland succession were not deterministically determined by soil conditions. Grass and tree expansion occurred slowly and dwarf shrub dominance was stable for more than 100 yr on large parts of the heath, even {{in the absence of}} management.

We demonstrate this approach for the endemic Hawaiian hardwood, Acacia koa, a species of major ecological and economic value in Hawaii. Using data from repeated censuses of multiple sites, we evaluated the influence of site quality and stand age on stocking guidelines for A. koa. Our results demonstrated that A. koa required less canopy space for a given dbh on moist windward sites than on drier leeward sites. In addition, we showed that on the windward sites A. koa required relatively less crown space with increasing tree size, whereas on the leeward site the opposite pattern was found. Size-density data from <b>permanent</b> <b>inventory</b> plots at the leeward study site showed excellent correspondence with the stocking guideline derived from the stem-crown diameter allometry.

Here we present the result of a study funded by the Walloon Public Service which aims to establish trace metal background concentration maps in Walloon soils. Two databases containing georeferenced soil analyzes providing data on soil background concentrations were used for this study: the CAPASOL database (17, 000 sampled agricultural soils) and the <b>permanent</b> <b>inventory</b> of woody resources (about 700 sampled forest soils). The methodology used for drawing the maps involves three steps. In the first step, we divided Wallonia (17, 000 km²) into soil pedogeochemical units based on (1) the soil map of the Wallonia (1 : 20, 000), (2) geological maps (1 : 40, 000 and 1 : 25, 000), and (3) literature data and survey results about soils and geology of Wallonia. In the second step, we produced a single reliable dataset by compiling the two available soil databases by a data selection and data leveling method which we designed for this purpose. On the last step, we drew the maps by using a geostatistical model based on the pedogeochemical soil units and the reliable dataset of soil analyzes produced in the previous step. The resulting maps reveal large variations in local background concentrations over short distances, mainly due to the high diversity of soil parent materials, and to the atmospheric deposition of pollutants around former base metal smelters. Wallonia has higher Ni background concentration in soil than average values in Europe (according to the values of Geochemical Atlas of Europe), principally because of high geogenic background levels. Also, higher Zn and Cd values are found, principally due to atmospheric deposition of pollutants originating from former base metal smelters...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The need {{to control}} exotic grasses in areas of {{ecological}} restoration for long periods is followed by high economical costs of application, collateral damage on regeneration and other less obvious environmental harms. Thus, it is necessary estimate such drawbacks in order to evaluate the cost/benefit rate of the application of these techniques. This study aimed to assess {{the damage caused by}} two control techniques of Guinea-grass (Megathyrsus maximus (Jacq.) B. K Simon & S. W. L. Jacobs), on pre-existing regeneration (environmental costs) in a 20 -year reforestation site and estimate the economic costs of employing such techniques. Thirty 10 x 20 m plots were divided into three groups: (CON) control, (ROC) mowing (using gas-powered brush cutters) and (HERB) mowing followed by the application of a glyphosate-based herbicide. We did a <b>permanent</b> <b>inventory</b> of all tree and shrub individuals, who were followed over a period of one year. No differences were found in mortality imposed by the initial mowing, neither in the mortality imposed exclusively by mowing nor in the mortality imposed exclusively by herbicide in HERB. After one year, there were no differences between mortality and species richness of the three groups. However, when the three groups were compared with themselves after one year, for plants > 1 m, we found a reduction on abundance in CON and reduction in species richness in HERB; whereas for plants < 1 m, ROC showed a reduction in abundance and HERB showed reduced abundance and species richness. Therefore, both techniques seem to affect more plants < 1 m (i. e., regeneration). The final economic cost of ROC was 34. 1 % bigger than the cost of HERB, and in spite of a likely reduction in costs to perform new interventions, proportional costs increased for scattered interventions over small areas. Both techniques were efficient to control Guinea-grass, but the use of glyphosate-based herbicide should be restricted to areas with low canopy cover, more maintenance-demanding sites, once the technique is more damaging on regeneration, since there was high mortality (73 %) of individuals < 1 m in areas with dense grass infestation (100 %) ...|$|E
40|$|The re-measurement of <b>permanent</b> forest <b>inventories</b> {{offers a}} unique {{opportunity}} to assess the occurrence and impact of forest disturbances. The present study aims at exploring the main forest damages in Norway based on the extensive data of several consecutive national forest inventories during the period 1995 - 2014. Five of the most common disturbance agents in Norway are selected for analysis: wind, snow, browsing, fungus and insect damage. The analyses focuses on the frequency and variation along time, the average damage at stand level and the spatial patterns of damage occurrence, resulting in a characterization of the damage produced by disturbances in Norway. The highest damage occurrences by disturbance agent are due to browsing, snow and wind. Snow presents a decreasing temporally trend in damage frequency in the studied period. By forest type, mature and intermediate birch forest are found to be more affected by snow damage, whereas mature spruce forest is by wind damage. The results from this study provide support to the hypothesis that damages by autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) on birch are more common in mature stands. No major attacks from bark beetle (Ips typographus) are found, probably related to the lack of major storm damages in the period. Forest types susceptibility to fungus has no apparent variation over time except in the last years, as increased occurrence is observed on mature spruce stands probably correlated with warmer than average periods. Browsing damage causes the most severe losses, as expected, in young stands, and is allocated mainly on the most productive forests. Although some of the disturbances present locally moderate effects, the results show no major disturbances threatening Norwegian forests in the studied period. Finally, the Norwegian national forest inventory demonstrates its reliability as a basis to understand the occurrence and effects of major natural disturbances...|$|R
40|$|We used <b>permanent</b> plot <b>inventories</b> of the Coweeta Basin (USDA FS Experimental Forest), Southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina (first sampled in 1934 {{and again}} in 1969 - 72 and 1988 - 93) to {{describe}} the distribution of species along an environmental gradient. We also explored the influence of large-scale disturbance on this deciduous forest. Chestnut blight fungus (Endothia parasitica) is an invasive species, which severely damaged populations of Castanea dentata and had widespread and long-term impacts on eastern North American forests. In 1926, local infestations of chestnut blight were reported in the Coweeta Basin; by 1930 most C. dentata trees were dead or dying from the blight. Concurrently, forests were further disturbed by lumbering, which was common across the region from the mid 1800 s to the early 1900 s. We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling for the analyses of the inventory periods. In 1934, C. dentata was the most abundant tree species. It was present in 98 % of the plots and contributed 22 % of the total density and 36 % of the total basal area. By the 1970 s, only sprouting stems of C. dentata remained in the forest due to chestnut blight induced mortality. The canopy dominant, C. dentata, was replaced {{by more than one}} species across the environmental gradient. Subsequently, diversity increased significantly over time and was attributed to an increase in evenness of species distribution. Quercus prinus, Acer rubrum, Cornus florida, Tsuga canadensis, and Oxydendrum arboreum increased by 2 - 5 % across the basin following the decline of C. dentata. Tsuga canadensis increased in abundance and distribution, especially near streams across elevations. Liriodendron tulipifera replaced C. dentata in moist coves, which have low terrain shape and high organic matter content. In contrast, Q. prinus and A. rubrum were ubiquitous, much like C. dentata before the chestnut blight, becoming dominant or co-dominant species across all environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The primary {{objective}} of the present research, which investigated consumer behavior regarding the storage of clothing items no longer worn, {{was to develop a}} model that describes and explains the process of consumer clothing inventory management. Data were collected via in-depth interviews of twenty-two adult female and male informants. Guided by a moderately structured interview guide, informants displayed and discussed clothing items they wear and clothing items they no longer wear. For items they wear, informants explained how they feel while wearing them, as well as why they might stop wearing them and what they might do with the items. For items they no longer wear, but still have, informants explained how they felt while wearing the items, why they stopped wearing the items, why they still have the items, and how they would feel if the items disappeared. For items they no longer have, they explained how they felt while wearing the items, why they stopped wearing the items, how they disposed of the items, and how they felt about their disposal decisions. Data show that consumers’ clothing inventories can be categorized accordingly: active, permanent inactive, temporary inactive, invisible inactive, and transitional inactive. Within <b>permanent</b> inactive <b>inventories</b> were items that informants believed they would never dispose; such items often symbolized various connections and/or held hedonic value. Within temporary inactive inventories were items that informants believed they would eventually dispose; such items were often stored because informants were waiting to find future opportunities to use the items or the best disposal outlets. Occasionally, clothing items were invisible to informants, made so either unintentionally or intentionally. Clothing items within transitional inactive inventories were those items that informants had taken psychological and behavioral steps towards disposing of, yet still retained possession. Data collected were used to develop a Consumer Clothing Inventory Management Model. The model explains what causes consumers to store versus dispose of inactive clothing items and provides direction regarding the identification of ways to encourage consumers to pass inactive items on to others who can use them...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 The United State Forest Service’s (USFS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) {{program is}} charged by Congress {{to monitor the}} nation’s forestlands—survey growth, {{mortality}} and composition, among other aspects related to the status and trends of United States (US) forests. To accomplish this, the FIA repeatedly inventories a massive network of sample plots that spans most of the country’s forests. Although the FIA’s <b>permanent</b> forest <b>inventory</b> network is {{the largest in the}} world, it does not represent the entirety of the nation’s forested landscape. Interior Alaska contains approximately 15 percent of the nation’s total forestland but, until recently, has not been included in the FIA’s monitoring efforts. Being one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to climate change in the US, it is pivotal to begin monitoring the dynamics of interior Alaska’s forested landscape. The vastness of the remote Alaskan landscape makes thorough field-only inventories prohibitively expensive—we need new and innovative methods to track forest dynamics in Alaska. The USFS and NASA’s Carbon Monitoring System jointly funded a pilot project in 2013 titled Monitoring Forest Carbon Stocks in Interior Alaska to examine the potential of airborne and spaceborne remote sensing technologies to augment sparse collections of field data to obtain carbon estimates with acceptable levels of precision. This study will yield first-ever regional estimates of carbon stocks for interior Alaska’s Tanana Valley leveraging FIA inventory data—an important initial step {{in the process of developing}} a forest monitoring system for Alaska’s wilderness. The research summarized in the following dissertation examines several statistical methods for coupling field and remotely sensed information to estimate aboveground biomass and carbon stocks that can potentially be used for tracking forest carbon dynamics of interior Alaska. Both design- and model-based inferential paradigms are considered. This research is strongly focused on the appropriate characterization of uncertainty in the form of standard errors and confidence intervals. Results form this research will help decision makers meet the challenges of environmental change by providing statistically rigorous methodologies that can estimate interior Alaskan carbon stocks. Having reliable and transparent estimates of carbon and biomass stocks can inform carbon management choices about the role Alaskan forestlands play in the global carbon system...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} an individual-based stochastic-empirical model {{to simulate the}} carbon dynamics of live and dead trees in a Central Amazon forest near Manaus, Brazil. The model is based on analyses of extensive field studies carried out on <b>permanent</b> forest <b>inventory</b> plots, and syntheses of published studies. New analyses included: (1) growth suppression of small trees, (2) maximum size (trunk base diameter) for 220 tree species, (3) the relationship between growth rate and wood density, and (4) the growth response of surviving trees to catastrophic mortality (from logging). The model simulates a forest inventory plot, and tracks recruitment, growth, and mortality of live trees, decomposition of dead trees (coarse litter), and how these processes vary with changing environmental conditions. Model predictions were tested against aggregated field data, and also compared with independent measurements including maximum tree age and coarse litter standing stocks. Spatial analyses demonstrated that a plot size of ∼ 10 ha was required to accurately measure wood (live and dead) carbon balance. With the model accurately predicting relevant pools and fluxes, a number of model experiments were performed to predict forest carbon balance response to perturbations including: (1) increased productivity due to CO 2 fertilization, (2) a single semi-catastrophic (10 %) mortality event, (3) increased recruitment and mortality (turnover) rates, and (4) the combined effects of increased turnover, increased tree growth rates, and decreased mean wood density of new recruits. Results demonstrated that carbon accumulation {{over the past few}} decades observed on tropical forest inventory plots (∼ 0. 5 Mg C ha - 1 year - 1) is not likely caused by CO 2 fertilization. A maximum 25 % increase in woody tissue productivity with a doubling of atmospheric CO 2 only resulted in an accumulation rate of 0. 05 Mg C ha - 1 year - 1 for the period 1980 - 2020 for a Central Amazon forest, or an order of magnitude less than observed on the inventory plots. In contrast, model parameterization based on extensive data from a logging experiment demonstrated a rapid increase in tree growth following disturbance, which could be misinterpreted as carbon sequestration if changes in coarse litter stocks were not considered. Combined results demonstrated that predictions of changes in forest carbon balance during the twenty-first century are highly dependent on assumptions of tree response to various perturbations, and underscores the importance of a close coupling of model and field investigations. © Springer-Verlag 2004...|$|R

A {{number of}} stylised facts regarding the financial performance and financing decisions of Spanish firms are first presented {{for the period}} 1985 - 2000 using repeated annual cross-sections of around 5, 000 manufacturing and retail firms. (i) In periods of general financial fragility, most notably during the recession of 1993, {{the experience of the}} most financially vulnerable companies is even more distressed than movements in aggregate or average figures would suggest (ii) the burden of borrowing costs has declined for most companies in the mid-/late- 1990 s, but particularly for those {{at the top of the}} distribution (iii) the cross-sectional distribution of indebtedness across firms has remained remarkably stable but (iv) this conceals significant variation in debt ratios for individual firms. Using panel data methods, the effects of financial pressure associated with servicing debt on a number of aspects of corporate behaviour are then examined, namely fixed investment, employment (both <b>permanent</b> and temporary), <b>inventories</b> and dividend policies. Our results quantify the responsiveness of each of these responses to financial pressure experienced by firms in Spain. Quantitatively large effects of financial pressure on investment and employment are estimated, although these work through more quickly in the case of fixed investment. The effects on employment are found to be larger and work through more quickly in the case of temporary than permanent employment. We also find significant effects on inventory investment and dividend payments confirming these additional mechanisms of adjustment by companies in Spain in resp onse to financial pressure. ...|$|R
40|$|Mediterranean {{sclerophyllous}} {{forests are}} coenoses worthy of great care {{because of their}} inherent bio-ecological value. The suspension of harvesting following the crisis of fuel wood market ruled the evolutive pattern of maquis over the last decades. In this phase, site quality {{seems to be the}} major driver of the holm oak-dominated forest recovery {{as well as of the}} lasting permanence of the sclerophyllous shrub forest. In this connection, stand dynamics has been monitored in three plots located in the strictly protected area of the &# 8220;Parco Regionale della Maremma&# 8221; (Grosseto - Tuscany), where natural evolution is in progress since at least five decades. The monitored stands are representative of different evolutive phases from the holm oak-dominated coppices to the typical maquis, as a function of the original stand structure and composition but also of the intensity and length of the applied coppice management system. The analysis was carried out by <b>permanent</b> transects; two <b>inventories</b> were undertaken in 1991 and 2006 to evaluate both compositional and structural variability and the dynamics in progress. Results at now highlight the role played by the residual site quality and specific composition in driving the evolutive pattern of tree species community. Under the absence of any silvicultural practice and better site conditions, the progress and specific incidence of regular mortality and the related aboveground biomass redistribution, supported the vegetation of holm oak and the other subsidiary species typical of more mature stages. The overall forest dynamics seemed anyway to proceed slowly and resulted in a steady physiognomy over a long time since the suspension of the historical disturbance made of repeated harvesting on short rotations...|$|R
40|$|The natural {{concentration}} of some elements in soil varies regionally according to lithology and locally with site-specific soil forming {{conditions such as}} relief or vegetation characteristics. Knowledge of the natural total concentrations of trace metals is now considered as prerequisite for the detection and assesment of anthropogenic contaminations. The <b>Permanent</b> Forest <b>Inventory</b> is a programme financed by the Ministry of the Walloon Region which aims at assessing and monitoring the forest condition in Southern Belgium. A part of this programme {{is dedicated to the}} implementation of a soil quality monitoring network. The observation plots are located at the intersection of a regular grid. Ten percent of the forest plots are planned to be sampled each year, which theorically supposes a time-frequency of 10 years for the monitoring considerations. Up to now, three field campaigns have been completed and 245 soil samples analyzed. Once a plot precisely located on the field, soil is sampled by mixing twenty 20 cm-deep cores taken at the perimeter of a 10 m large circle. Environmental observations complete the field work. These concern the physical environment, the soil morphology and the vegetation characteristics. The following parameters are measured in the laboratory: total organic carbon, total nitrogen, pHwater, pHKCl, exchangeable acidity and aluminium, cationic exchangeable capacity, NH 4 Cl-exctractible cations, total, mineral, and exchangeable P, and aqua-regia extractible concentrations of Ca, Mg, K, Al, Fe, Cr, Ni, Mn, Zn, Cu, Pb, Co, and Cd. Statistical analysis were then performed on the results in order to identify the driving factors of the soil properties, especially the geochemical determinism. Relationships between parameters and between parameters and field observations were thus investigated. Then the relevance of some classifications to differenciate the soil properties was evaluated and finally the spatial structure of the parameters was compared to the geographical distribution patterns of lithology, soil associations, or ecological territories. Although some diversity can be found among the soil series in this survey, soils developped from shales and/or sandstones are largely dominant. The first results therefore show a large extreme-based variability and moderate variation coefficients. The exchangeable cations and carbonate–sensitive parameters are the most variable. Frequency distributions are often largely skewed. Exchangeable cations appear to be more closely linked to acidity status than organic content while pseudo-total concentrations show rather good linear relationships between each other, to the exception of Pb and Cd. Both elements seem linked to specific lithologies, the presence of limestone for Pb, some clay-rich parent material or limestone for Cd. Among the soil characteristics, the nature and the abundance of the coarse fragments associated to the fine earth is the most differenciating criteria for pseudo-total content. Finally, there are clear convergences between spatial distributions of most of the elements and lithology or small natural regions. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In this work, I answer timely {{questions}} regarding tree growth, tree survival, and community change in California tree species, {{using a variety}} of sophisticated statistical and remote sensing tools. In Chapter 1, I address tree growth for a single tree species with a thorough explanation of hierarchical state-space models for forest inventory data. Understanding tree growth as a function of tree size is important for a multitude of ecological and management applications. Determining what limits growth is of central interest, and forest <b>inventory</b> <b>permanent</b> plots are an abundant source of long-term information but are highly complex. Observation error and multiple sources of shared variation (spatial plot effects, temporal repeated measures, and a mosaic of sampling intervals) make these data challenging to use for growth estimation. I account for these complexities and incorporate potential limiting factors (tree size, competition, and resource supply) into a hierarchical state-space model. I estimate the diameter growth of white fir (Abies concolor) in the Sierra Nevada of California from forest inventory data, showing that estimating such a model is feasible in a Bayesian framework using readily available modeling tools. In this forest, white fir growth depends strongly on tree size, total plot basal area, and unexplained variation between individual trees. Plot-level resource supply variables (representing light, water, and nutrient availability) do not have a strong impact on inventory-size trees. This approach can be applied to other networks of permanent forest plots, leading to greater ecological insights on tree growth. In Chapter 2, I expand my state-space modeling to examine survival in seven tree species, as well as investigating the results of modeling them in aggregate (at the community level) and comparing with the individual species models. Declining tree survival is a complex, well-recognized problem, but studies have been largely limited to relatively rare old-growth forests or low-diversity systems, and to models which are species-aggregated or cannot easily accommodate yearly climate variables. I estimate survival models for a relatively diverse second-growth forest in the Sierra Nevada of California using a hierarchical state-space framework. I account for a mosaic of measurement intervals and random plot variation, and I directly include yearly stand development variables alongside climate variables and topographic proxies for nutrient limitation. My model captures the expected dependence of survival on tree size. At the community level, stand development variables account for decreasing survival trends, but species-specific models reveal a diversity of factors influencing survival. Species time trends in survival do not always conform to existing theories of Sierran forest dynamics, and size relationships with survival differ for each species. Within species, low survival is concentrated in susceptible subsets of the population and single estimates of annual survival rates do not reflect this heterogeneity in survival. Ultimately only full population dynamics integrating these results with models of recruitment can address the potential for community shifts over time. In Chapter 3, I combine statistical modeling with remote sensing techniques to investigate whether topographic variables influence changes in woody cover. In the North Coast of California, changes in fire management have resulted in conversion of oak woodland into coniferous forest, but the controls on this slow transition are unknown. Historical aerial imagery, in combination with Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA), allows us to classify land cover types from the 1940 s and compare these maps with recent cover. Few studies have used these maps to model drivers of cover change, partly due to two statistical challenges: 1) appropriately accounting for spatial autocorrelation (ideally without throwing away data) and 2) appropriately modeling percent cover which is bounded between 0 and 100 and not normally distributed. I study the change in woody cover in California's North Coast using historical (1948) and recent (2009) high-spatial-resolution imagery. I classify the imagery using eCognition Developer and aggregate the resulting maps to the scale of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in order to understand topographic drivers of woody cover change. I use Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with a quasi-binomial probability distribution to account for spatial autocorrelation and the boundedness of the percent woody cover variable. I explore the relative roles of elevation, topographic slope, aspect (Northness/Eastness), topographic wetness index, profile curvature, historical percent woody cover, and geographical coordinates in influencing current percent woody cover. I estimate these models for scales of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 m, reflecting both tree neighborhood scales and stand scales. I find that historical woody cover has a consistent positive effect on current woody cover, and that the spatial term in the model is significant even after controlling for historical cover. Specific topographic variables emerge as important for different sites at different scales, but no overall pattern emerges across sites or scales for any of the topographic variables I tested. This GAM framework for modeling historical data is flexible and could be used with more variables, more flexible relationships with predictor variables, and larger scales. Modeling drivers of woody cover change from historical ecology data sources can be a valuable way to plan restoration and enhance ecological insight into landscape change. I conclude that these techniques are promising but a framework is needed for sensitivity analysis, as modeling results can depend strongly on variable selection and model structure...|$|R
