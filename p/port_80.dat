25|$|More complex attacks will however be hard {{to block}} with simple rules: for example, {{if there is an}} ongoing attack on <b>port</b> <b>80</b> (web service), it is not {{possible}} to drop all incoming traffic on this port because doing so will prevent the server from serving legitimate traffic. Additionally, firewalls may be too deep in the network hierarchy, with routers being adversely affected before the traffic gets to the firewall.|$|E
25|$|Application layer {{protocols}} generally {{treat the}} transport layer (and lower) protocols as black boxes which provide a stable network connection across which to communicate, although the applications are usually aware of key {{qualities of the}} transport layer connection such as the end point IP addresses and port numbers. Application layer protocols are often associated with particular client-server applications, and common services have well-known port numbers reserved by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). For example, the HyperText Transfer Protocol uses server <b>port</b> <b>80</b> and Telnet uses server port 23. Clients connecting to a service usually use ephemeral ports, i.e., port numbers assigned only {{for the duration of}} the transaction at random or from a specific range configured in the application.|$|E

500|$|The Rosetta@home {{application}} and the BOINC distributed computing platform {{are available for}} the operating systems Windows, Linux, and macOS; BOINC also runs on several others, e.g., FreeBSD. [...] Participation in Rosetta@home requires a central processing unit (CPU) with a clock speed of at least 500MHz, 200megabytes of free disk space, 512megabytes of physical memory, and Internet connectivity. [...] As of July 20, 2016, {{the current version of}} the Rosetta Mini application is 3.73. The current recommended BOINC program version is 7.6.22. [...] Standard Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) (<b>port</b> <b>80)</b> is used for communication between the user's BOINC client and the Rosetta@home servers at the University of Washington; HTTPS (port 443) is used during password exchange. [...] Remote and local control of the BOINC client use port 31416 and port 1043, which might need to be specifically unblocked if they are behind a firewall. [...] Workunits containing data on individual proteins are distributed from servers located in the Baker lab at the University of Washington to volunteers' computers, which then calculate a structure prediction for the assigned protein. [...] To avoid duplicate structure predictions on a given protein, each workunit is initialized with a random seed number. [...] This gives each prediction a unique trajectory of descent along the protein's energy landscape. [...] Protein structure predictions from Rosetta@home are approximations of a global minimum in a given protein's energy landscape. [...] That global minimum represents the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e., its native state.|$|E
