40|$|Nearly {{two hundred}} transboundary <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> {{comprise}} {{a portion of}} the global conservation landscape the size of India, with further expansion anticipated. Proponents claim that transboundary <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> outperform isolated <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> in achieving conservation objectives, while regional case studies have led critics to challenge this claim. Empirical investigation into the relative performance of transboundary <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> is fundamentally limited since these areas cannot be directly compared to the isolated <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> that might otherwise have emerged in the same location. This paper develops a game theory model of park formation to compare counterfactual transboundary and isolated <b>protected</b> <b>areas.</b> The model suggests that under certain conditions, transboundary <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> can achieve greater conservation and production objectives, {{even in the absence of}} international cooperative park management. The paper establishes five sufficient conditions for transboundary <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> to provide greater national welfare, domestic conservation value, or global conservation value than counterfactual isolated <b>protected</b> <b>areas.</b> These conditions are tested for three common conservation objectives. The results suggest that when the objective of conservation is species persistence or interior habitat, conservation groups should encourage transboundary <b>protected</b> <b>areas.</b> However, when the objective of conservation is to extend reserve coverage to the maximum number of species, conservation groups should encourage <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> where species richness is greatest, whether or not these areas span international borders.

Over a 10 -year period (2003 - 2012), the Amazon <b>Protected</b> <b>Areas</b> Program (ARPA) aims to {{establish}} 375, 000 km 2 in new <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> and consolidate {{a total of}} 600, 000 km 2 in both new and existing <b>protected</b> <b>areas,</b> making it {{by far the most}} ambitious <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> program in the world.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} impact of <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> on land-cover clearing, using a {{metadata}} analysis of information on 49 locations from 22 countries. <b>Protected</b> <b>areas</b> had significantly lower rates of clearing in comparison to their surroundings. In addition, <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> had also significantly lowered rates of clearing within their boundary following initiation of protection. Thus, <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> do appear to be effective at limiting overall landcover clearing. There was some variation in the rates of clearing across regions, where most <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> from North America and Europe showed positive rates of landcover change, while <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> from Asia had {{the highest rates of}} land-cover clearing. While most <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> from North America and Europe involved a relatively smaller number of actors, a greater number of actors and drivers of clearing was implicated in <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, indicating the increased difficulties faced by park management in these regions. In contrast, country income levels and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources category of protection did not appear to impact the likelihood of land-cover clearing in <b>protected</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
