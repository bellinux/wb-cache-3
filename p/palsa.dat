50|$|<b>Palsa</b> {{surfaces}} are frequently traversed by open cracks, caused by doming (dilation cracking), frost cracking, or desiccation. The vegetation of a <b>palsa</b> may comprise low shrubs and lichen {{in addition to}} the sedges characterizing the peat. Also, the higher a <b>palsa</b> grows the dryer the peat covering the <b>palsa</b> becomes leading to more insulation which protects the inner core from melting.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Palsa</b> forms include mounds, {{moderately}} straight ridges, {{and winding}} ridges. Palsas in Iceland {{have been described}} as hump shaped, dike shaped, plateau shaped, ring shaped, and shield shaped, those in Norway as <b>palsa</b> plateaus, esker palsas, string palsas, conical ore dome-shaped palsas, and <b>palsa</b> complexes.|$|E
50|$|A <b>palsa</b> is a low, often oval, {{frost heave}} {{occurring}} in polar and subpolar climates, which contain permanently frozen ice lenses. Like pingos, palsas consist of an ice core with overlying soil, {{but they are}} generally smaller than pingos, often occur in groups and may develop from ground water without additional hydrostatic pressure. Palsas are characteristically found in areas with discontinuous permafrost, and in such areas {{they may be the}} only reliable surface evidence of permafrost. Surface water, found in bogs, enhances <b>palsa</b> formation in areas called <b>palsa</b> bogs.|$|E

50|$|Palsas are {{structurally}} {{similar to}} pingos, however with heights between approx. 0.5 and 2 m and lengths between approx. 5 and 25 m, palsas are significantly smaller than pingos. Both however {{are considered to}} be true perennial permafrost mounds since both occur in areas of continuous permafrost. Moreover, contrary to pingos which are usually isolated, palsas usually arise in groups with other palsas, such as in a so-called <b>palsa</b> bog. Unlike pingos, palsas do not require surrounding permafrost to grow, seeing as <b>palsa</b> are permafrost. Pingos also grow below the active layer, which is the depth that the annual freeze-thaw cycle occurs, and <b>palsa</b> grow in the active layer.|$|E

50|$|Palsas {{appear to}} go through a {{developmental}} cycle that eventually leads to thawing and collapse. Open cracks that commonly accompany <b>palsa</b> growth and the water that tends to accumulate around palsas, probably {{as a result of their}} weight depressing the adjacent bog surface, are important factors in this process. The fact that palsas in various stages of growth and decay occur together shows that their collapse is not necessarily indicative of climatic change. All that is usually left after a <b>palsa</b> collapses is a depression surrounded by a rim.|$|E

50|$|The {{overlying}} {{soil layer}} is gradually lifted up by frost heaving. In cross-section, the ice cores of a <b>palsa</b> show layering, {{which is caused}} by the successive winter freezing intervals. The pressing out of water from the pores is not crucial, however, since the boggy soil is water-saturated and thus always provides enough water for ice core growth.|$|E
50|$|Tilted trees {{may also}} be caused by frost heaving, and {{subsequent}} <b>palsa</b> development, hummocks, earthflows, forested active rock glaciers,landslides, or earthquakes.

5000|$|<b>Palsa</b> (plural: palsas) {{is a term}} {{from the}} Finnish {{language}} meaning [...] "a hummock rising out of a bog with a core of ice," [...] {{which in turn is}} a borrowing from Northern Sami, balsa.

5000|$|North America: A {{region of}} {{peatland}} extends from Alaska {{in the west}} to the coast of the Atlantic in the east, and is comparable in size to that of West Siberia. A zone of domed raised bogs adjoins the zones of <b>palsa</b> bogs and string fens. In the direction of descent towards the ocean, blanket bogs occur east of Hudson Bay. These are superseded towards the west by plateau bogs {{in the area of the}} large lakes and, eventually, by kermi bogs.|$|E
5000|$|Widths are {{commonly}} 10-30 m, and lengths 15-150 m. However, lengths {{of up to}} 500 m have been reported for esker-like <b>palsa</b> ridges running parallel to the gradient of a bog. Heights range from less than 1 m to about 10 m at a maximum above the surrounding area. Large forms tend to be considerably less conical than small ones. In places, palsas combine to form complexes several hundred meters in extent. The permafrost core contains ice lenses no thicker than 2-3 cm, though locally lenses up to almost 40 cm thick have been described.|$|E
50|$|Stordalen mire (elevation 351 m) {{lies in the}} subarctic {{region in}} northernmost Sweden. It is located 10 km east {{of the town of}} Abisko close to Lake Torneträsk. It is a 25 ha <b>palsa</b> mire, which is common in the {{discontinuous}} permafrost zone. The mire has two major topographical features: elevated palsas and depressions. The palsas are dry, ombrotrophic plateaus (or hummocks) with permafrost cores that raise the peat surface above its surroundings that is the wet minerotrophic depressions, largely permafrostfree and water saturated. The small-scale topography is often very patchy in its structure, creating an environment where localities nearby each other have distinct differences in moisture, permafrost and nutrient status, which creates differences in vegetation types. Of these subhabitats the vegetation in the dry parts consists mainly of mosses, lichens and dwarf shrubs, whereas the wet parts are dominated by sphagnum or tall graminoids. A peat layer up to 3 m deep covers most of the area and is an indication of a net carbon accumulation over the past 5000 years. In the areas underlying by permafrost the active layer reaches a thickness of about 60 cm in the late summer. The mire experiences thermokarst erosion, with the ongoing permafrost thawing that leads to degradation and collapse of the <b>palsa</b> structure, converting it into the wetter surface types. To the east the mire is bordered by the shallow Lake Villasjön (max depth 1.3 m) whereas it is in general largely surrounded by mountain birch forest.|$|E
50|$|<b>Palsa</b> bogs (Palsamoore or Palsenmoore) {{are found}} {{on the margins of}} the Arctic {{permafrost}} soils (tundra). Here the ridges of the string bogs can grow into hummocks several metres high. Like string bogs, the so-called palsas frequently lie within peatlands fed by mineral soil water. Some are surrounded by water-filled, ditch-like hollows. Peat formation is limited; these bogs are peat deposits from warmer, interglacial periods and did not experience frost heaving of their inner core of ice until the climate became colder. These ice lenses increase in size from year to year as a result of freeze-thaw processes of the surrounding water. The low temperatures prevent full decomposition of the organic material.|$|E
5000|$|Palsas may be {{initiated}} {{in areas of}} a moor or bog where the winter freezing front penetrates relatively faster than surrounding areas, perhaps due to an unusually thin cover of snow. The lack of thermal insulation provided by thick snow permits much deeper freezing in winter. This ice may then last through the summer with a persistent 'bump' of up to several cm due to frost heave. The elevated surface of a <b>palsa</b> will tend also to have thinner snow cover, allowing greater winter cooling, while in summer the surface material (especially if organic) will dry out and provide thermal insulation. Thus the interior temperature is consistently {{lower than that of}} adjacent ground. This contributes to the formation of an ice lens which grows by drawing up surrounding water. The expansion of the ice upon freezing exerts pressure on the surrounding soil, further forcing water out of its pore spaces which then accumulates on and increases the volume of the growing ice lens. A positive feedback loop develops. Changes in surface moisture and vegetation will then be such as to preserve the newly formed permafrost.|$|E

40|$|<b>Palsa</b> mires are sub-Arctic {{peatland}} complexes, vulnerable ecosystems with {{patches of}} permafrost. Permafrost thawing in <b>palsa</b> mires occurs throughout Fennoscandia, {{probably due to}} local climatic warming. In <b>palsa</b> mires, permafrost thaw alters hydrological conditions, vegetation structure and microhabitat composition with unknown consequences for invertebrate fauna. This study's objectives were to examine the role of microhabitat heterogeneity {{and the effects of}} permafrost dynamics and thaw on oribatid mite communities in <b>palsa</b> mires. Oribatid mites were sampled in two <b>palsa</b> mires in Finland and Norway. Three different types of microhabitats were examined: graminoid-dominated wet sites, herb-dominated small hummocks and evergreen shrub-dominated permafrost-underlain <b>palsa</b> hummocks. The results indicate that permafrost dynamics are an important factor structuring oribatid mite communities in <b>palsa</b> mires. The community composition of oribatid mites differed remarkably among microhabitats. Six species were significantly more abundant in permafrost-underlain microhabitats in relation to non-permafrost microhabitats. None of the species identified occurred exclusively in permafrost-underlain microhabitats. Findings suggest that permafrost thaw may not have an impact on species diversity but may alter community composition of oribatid mites in <b>palsa</b> mire ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Palsas are peat mounds with a perennially frozen core {{which are}} mainly formed due to ice segregation. They {{are located in}} bogs in warmer (sporadic and discontinuous) {{permafrost}} zones and they are therefore sensitive to environmental changes unfavourable for permafrost. In this study I have investigated a particular <b>palsa</b> in Haukskardsmyra, {{which is the largest}} <b>palsa</b> bog in the Dovre Mountains, southern Norwegian Mountains. Due to its southerly position, this mire is located on the climatic limit for <b>palsa</b> existence and therefore, can give valuable information about the reaction of palsas and the rate of degradation to climate amelioration. The <b>palsa</b> has been mapped and monitored over the period 2006 - 2007 - 2008 for change detection. The <b>palsa</b> surface height, depth of the thawed layer over the frozen ground and snow depths have been measured. To monitor the temperature at the study site, TinyTag data loggers have been used since 2006. The data loggers have been located on the <b>palsa</b> surface, at 10, 30 and 70 cm depths and 1. 8 m above the surface. This data, combined with temperature data from a nearby weather station, has been used to back-calculate mean annual temperatures of the <b>palsa</b> site until 1865. Aerial photographs from 1963, 1979, 1992 and 2002 have been investigated to trace the <b>palsa</b> development over the last half century. Since 1865 the mean annual air temperature has increased by more than 1 °C at the <b>palsa</b> site and the present mean annual air temperature is slightly above 0 °C. Mean annual precipitation has increased by about 100 mm since 1923. Since 1963 the <b>palsa</b> bog has degraded significantly, as shown by repeated aerial photography and field studies. Over the period 2006 - 2008 the studied <b>palsa</b> has experienced a severe and violent degradation, with large parts falling into the water. Presently, both temperature and precipitation are likely too high to allow <b>palsa</b> development at Haukskardsmyra. Hence, the <b>palsa</b> bog is situated out of the climatic limit which favours <b>palsa</b> development. It is likely that the palsas at Haukskardsmyra will disappear within the next 30 - 50 years and, by inference that also other <b>palsa</b> bogs in Dovre will decrease substantially in size and distribution...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{outlines}} {{the development and}} decay of palsas in northern Sweden in relation to climatic and environmental factors. Palsas were investigated on morphology, vegetation, peat porosity, ground temperature and local climate in four bogs situated on a north-south gradient in northern Sweden. A new classification for <b>palsa</b> stages (embryo, young, mature, degrading and remnant stage), based on morphological and vegetational characteristics, is proposed and described in the thesis. The start of <b>palsa</b> growth seems to be favoured by a low vegetation height and a high cover of Sphagnum mosses. Very high porosities were measured in this peat type, resulting in a high insulation capacity preserving the frozen ground in summer. A decrease of porosities in the surface peat layer from the embryo <b>palsa</b> stage to the mature and degrading <b>palsa</b> stage was found. This contributes to the degrading of palsas, due to higher thermal diffusivities in palsas with lower porosities. The aggradation of the ice core can also cease due to the observed change in vegetation from low vegetation on embryo and young palsas to vegetation with tall Betula nana shrubs on degrading palsas. This was found to cause thicker snow cover that prevents frost penetration into the <b>palsa</b> core. The present climate conditions (with mean annual temperature of – 1. 5 °C and annual precipitation of 737 mm) at the boundary of <b>palsa</b> distribution in Sweden {{were found to be}} unsuitable for <b>palsa</b> development. <b>Palsa</b> growth started here during a cold period in {{the last part of the}} Little Ice Age, with estimated mean annual and mean winter temperatures of – 2. 3 °C and – 10. 0 °C, respectively.
