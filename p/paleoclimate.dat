25|$|Beyond this, {{there are}} several {{different}} scenarios that have been advanced {{to account for the}} form and distribution in both space and time of the valleys. Each has its own set of implications regarding the <b>paleoclimate</b> of Mars at the time of formation of the networks. Some of these are summarized below. It is also worth emphasizing that, as on Earth, different formation mechanisms are likely to operate at different times and places on the surface of Mars.|$|E
25|$|The form, distribution, and implied {{evolution}} of the valley networks are of great importance for what they may {{tell us about the}} history of liquid water on the martian surface, and hence Mars' climate history. Some authors have argued that the properties of the networks demand that a hydrological cycle must have been active on ancient Mars, though this remains contentious. Objections chiefly arise from repeated results from models of martian <b>paleoclimate</b> suggesting high enough temperatures and pressures to sustain liquid water on the surface have not ever been possible on Mars.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen atoms easily {{separate}} from electronegative bonds such as hydroxyl bonds (O-H), nitrogen bonds (N-H), and thiol/mercapto bonds (S-H) on hour to day long timescales. This rapid exchange is particularly problematic for measurements of bulk organic material with these functional groups because isotope compositions {{are more likely}} to reflect the source water and not the isotope effect. For this reason, records of <b>paleoclimate</b> that are not measuring ancient waters, rely on other isotopic markers. Advancements in the 1990s held promising potential to resolve this problem: samples were equilibrated with two variations of heavy water and compared. Their ratios represent an exchange factor that can calibrate measurements to correct for hydrogen and deuterium swapping.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen isotope {{biogeochemistry}} is {{the scientific}} study of biological, geological, and chemical processes in the environment using the distribution and relative abundance of hydrogen isotopes. There are two stable isotopes of hydrogen, protium 1H and deuterium 2H, which vary in relative abundance on the order of hundreds of permil. The ratio between these two species can be considered the hydrogen isotopic fingerprint of a substance. Understanding isotopic fingerprints and the sources of fractionation that lead to variation between them can be applied to address a diverse array of questions ranging from ecology and hydrology to geochemistry and <b>paleoclimate</b> reconstructions. Since specialized techniques are required to measure natural hydrogen isotope abundance ratios, the field of hydrogen isotope biogeochemistry provides uniquely specialized tools to more traditional fields like ecology and geochemistry.|$|E
25|$|The carbon-bonded {{hydrogen}} {{isotopic composition}} of cellulose, as inherited from leaf water, {{has the potential}} of preserving the original meteoric water signal. This was first demonstrated in the 1970s. In a systematic survey across North America, tree cellulose δD was found to have a temperature sensitivity of 5.8‰/°C, similar to precipitation δD sensitivity of 5.6‰/°C. This spatial correlation may be complicated by local effects of soil evaporation and leaf transpiration, and the spatial gradient may not be representative of temporal changes in tree ring cellulose at a single place. The mechanism that generates the δD signal in cellulose from meteoric water is not completely understood, but at least includes leaf water transpiration, synthesis of carbohydrates, synthesis of cellulose from photosynthetic sugars, and exchange of sugars with xylem water. Modeling studies show that observed tree ring cellulose δD can be produced when 36% of the hydrogen in sugars can exchange with xylem water, and effects such as humidity and rainfall seasonality may complicate the cellulose δD proxy. Despite these complications, tree ring δD have been used for <b>paleoclimate</b> reconstructions of the past few millennia. For example, a tree ring cellulose δD records from pine trees in the White Mountains, California shows a 50‰ depletion from 6800 year ago to present. The cooling trend since the mid-Holocene thermal maximum is consistent with ice core and pollen records, but the corresponding magnitude of cooling is elusive due to complicated influences from local effects such as humidity and soil water composition. The meaning of isotopes in cellulose and its applications is still an area of active study.|$|E
500|$|Nothing {{definitive}} {{is known}} about the island's biogeography {{at the time of the}} colonization, however, the <b>paleoclimate</b> (ancient weather patterns) may have been affected by Madagascar's location below the subtropical ridge at 30° S latitude and disruption of the weather patterns by India as it drifted northward. [...] Both would have created a drying effect on Madagascar, and as a result, the arid spiny bush that is currently found in the south and southwest of Madagascar would have dominated the island. [...] This would have placed strong selection pressure for drought tolerance on the inhabitants of the island between the Cretaceous and the Eocene. [...] As Madagascar edged above the subtropical ridge and India moved closer to Asia, the climate became less dry and the arid spiny bush retreated to the south and southwest.|$|E

500|$|Remains of Lundomys {{have been}} found at six Pleistocene localities in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, which {{suggests}} a warm and humid <b>paleoclimate</b> there.

40|$|Past climates {{experienced}} by fossil plant species {{have often been}} inferred based on the environmental requirements of their evolutionarily nearest living relatives (NLR). Here we have combined paleoclimatic estimation using NLRs with ecolological niche modeling (ENM) and have demonstrated the combined approach by inferring the Eocene environment of Aesculus L. (Hippocastanoideae, Sapindaceae), a genus of woody eudicots with extant species generally preferring temperate climates. Specifically, we applied ENM-NLR to four Eocene floras in which Aesculus fossils are known to occur: McAbee and Princeton (British Columbia), Republic (Washington State), and Spitsbergen (European Arctic Circle). Additionally, we used ENM-NLR to estimate whether paleoenvironmental conditions were suitable for Aesculus at a fifth flora, Copper Basin (Nevada), where the fossil record of the genus is less clear. We generated models for all NLRs in Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Production using georeferenced data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and Bioclim environmental parameters. For each fossil flora, the best models of individual NLRs were summarized into composite community models, which were taken to represent climatically analogous modern communities and used to infer the <b>paleoclimates</b> of the fossil localities. Our results are generally consistent with previous studies that used other methods to estimate <b>paleoclimates</b> and suggest that McAbee, Princeton, Republic, and Spitsbergen had temperate environments. For the Copper Basin flora, our results show ranges of environmental variables that may be too broad for predicting whether Aesculus was present.
