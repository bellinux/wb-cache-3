Generally, the piston frequency is fixed as 60 Hz and the <b>piston</b> <b>stroke</b> is adjusted. In this paper, performance analysis of instantaneous <b>piston</b> <b>stroke</b> in a single phase PWM inverter has been done for four different types of filters. These filters are used to calculate and control the maximum values of the estimated <b>piston</b> <b>stroke</b> and current instantaneously and to analyze the dynamic characteristics of the stroke control in a linear compressor system.
