In particular, we solve a problem with the core disambiguation procedure of Marching Cubes 33 that prevents the extraction of topologically correct isosurfaces for the ambiguous configuration 13. 5. This work closes an existing gap in the topological correctness of Marching Cubes 33. Furthermore, we make our results reproducible, meaning that examples provided in this work can be easily explored and studied. Finally, as part of the philosophy of reproducibility, we provide a corrected version of the Marching Cubes 33 open-source implementation and access to datasets that can be used to verify the correctness of any available topologically correct isosurface extraction implementation that <b>preserves</b> <b>the</b> <b>topology</b> of <b>the</b> trilinear interpolant...|$|R
40|$|In many {{classification}} problems, it {{is necessary}} to consider the specific location of an n-dimensional space from which features have been calculated. For example, considering the location of features extracted from specific areas of a two-dimensional space, as an image, could improve the understanding of a scene for a video surveillance system. In the same way, the same features extracted from different locations could mean different actions for a 3 D HCI system. In this paper, we present a self-organizing feature map able to <b>preserve</b> <b>the</b> <b>topology</b> of locations of an n-dimensional space in which the vector of features have been extracted. The main contribution is to implicitly <b>preserving</b> <b>the</b> <b>topology</b> of <b>the</b> original space because considering the locations of the extracted features and their <b>topology</b> could ease <b>the</b> solution to certain problems. Specifically, the paper proposes the n-dimensional constrained self-organizing map <b>preserving</b> <b>the</b> input <b>topology</b> (nD-SOM-PINT). Features in adjacent areas of the n-dimensional space, used to extract the feature vectors, are explicitly in adjacent areas of the nD-SOM-PINT constraining the neural network structure and learning. As a study case, the neural network has been instantiate to represent and classify features as trajectories extracted from a sequence of images into a high level of semantic understanding. Experiments have been thoroughly carried out using the CAVIAR datasets (Corridor, Frontal and Inria) taken into account the global behaviour of an individual in order to validate <b>the</b> ability to <b>preserve</b> <b>the</b> <b>topology</b> of <b>the</b> two-dimensional space to obtain high-performance classification for trajectory classification in contrast of non-considering the location of features.

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{important}} feature of the Neural Gas is its ability to <b>preserve</b> <b>the</b> <b>topology</b> in <b>the</b> projection of highly dimensional input spaces to lower dimensions vector quantizations. For this reason, the Neural Gas {{has proven to be a}} valuable tool in data mining applica-tions. In this paper an incremental ensemble method for the combination of various Neural Gas models is proposed. Several models are trained with bootstrap samples of the data, the “codebooks ” with similar Voronoi polygons are merged in one fused node and neighborhood relations are established by linking similar fused nodes. The aim of combining the Neural Gas is to improve the quality and robustness of the topological representation of the single model. We have called this model Fusion-NG. Computational experiments show that the Fusion-NG model effectively <b>preserves</b> <b>the</b> <b>topology</b> of <b>the</b> input space and improves the representation of the single Neural Gas model.
