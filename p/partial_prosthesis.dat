40|$|An {{experimental}} animal model is presented {{for the analysis}} of the influence of axial and nonaxial loading on bone remodeling around oral implants. Axial and nonaxial loading conditions were introduced by placing a bilaterally supported fixed <b>partial</b> <b>prosthesis</b> and a cantilever fixed <b>partial</b> <b>prosthesis</b> on two IMZ implants in the mandibles of beagle dogs. Quantitative and qualitative histologic analyses revealed different remodeling tendencies between the loading conditions. Axial loading induced a more uniform, histologically quiescent remodeling response that gradually decreased from the coronal aspect to the apex of the implant.

Twenty-three units galvano-ceramic fxed dentures have been used for this study (fg. 1, 2). 250 slices at an interval of 20 microns each have been created for each investigation.

Materials and Methods: The study group consisted of 45 patients who were restored with posterior three-unit fixed <b>partial</b> denture <b>prosthesis</b> made using direct laser sintered metal-ceramic restorations. Patient recall and clinical examination of the restorations were done after 6 months and every 12 months thereafter for the period of 60 months.

The axial and non-axial loading conditions were introduced by inserting a bilaterally supported fixed <b>partial</b> <b>prosthesis</b> and a cantilever fixed <b>partial</b> <b>prosthesis</b> on two IMZ implants in the mandible of beagle dogs. Earlier {{quantitative and qualitative}} histological analyses revealed a statistically significant different remodelling response between both loading conditions. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional models are built to analyse and compare von Mises equivalent stress, maximum principal stress, maximum principal strain and strain energy density distributions, first around a free-standing implant and subsequently around the implants of the two prosthesis designs under the respective resultant in vivo loads. Strong correlations between the calculated stress distributions in the surrounding bone tissue and the remodelling phenomena in the comparative animal model are observed. It is concluded that the highest bone remodelling events coincide with the regions of highest equivalent stress and that the major remodelling differences between axial and non-axial loading are largely determined by the horizontal stress component of the engendered stresses. status: publishe...|$|E

At this time, in dental office, it is difficult or even impossible to evaluate a metal ceramic crown or bridge before setting it in the oral cavity. The possibilities of ceramic fractures are due to small fracture lines or material defects inside the esthetic layers. Material and methods: In this study 25 metal ceramic crowns and fixed <b>partial</b> <b>prostheses</b> were investigated by radiographic method (Rx), micro computer tomography (MicroCT) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) working in Time Domain, at 1300 nm. The OCT system contains two interferometers and one scanner. For each incident analysis a stuck made of 100 slices was obtain. These slices were used in order to obtain a 3 D model of the ceramic interface. After detecting the presence and the positions of the ceramic defects the numerical simulation method was used to estimate the biomechanical effect of the masticatory forces on fractures propagations in ceramic materials. Results: For all the dental ceramic defects numerical simulation analysis was performed. The simulation of crack propagation shows that the crack could initiate from the upper, lower or both parts of the defect and propagates through the ceramic material where tensile stress field is present. RX and MicroCT are very powerful instruments that provide a good characterization of the dental construct.

Consecutive intraoral radiographs taken with the paralleling technique were used. In all, 660 partially edentulous patients ever treated in the departments (248 males; 15 - 83 years of age) with 1655 implants, which were successfully integrated at abutment connection, were loaded by means of fixed <b>partial</b> <b>prostheses.</b> The observation period starting at abutment connection reached 16 years (mean 5. 1). Implants were divided into three groups: 235 implants supported single-tooth crowns, 398 supported implant-tooth connected and 1022 free-standing fixed <b>partial</b> <b>prostheses.</b> Implants were placed in maxilla and mandible, both anteriorly and posteriorly. No significant difference in bone level evolution was predicted between the three groups of implants, either for posterior or for anterior sites. The estimated marginal bone loss for the first 6 months is 0. 31 mm/year and after that 0. 015 mm/year higher in the maxilla than in the mandible. More bone loss was predicted for the first 6 months when dehiscences existed, when a membrane or a bone graft were used, or when metal/ceramic prosthesis material was applied. Age and gender did not affect the change in bone level. The use of subsequently situated single-implant crowns to restore an edentulous space did not lead to more marginal bone loss than around splinted implants.

Furthermore, a multivariate analysis was conducted to determine which factors, when considered together, influence the complication and failure rates of fixed implant-supported prostheses. MATERIALS AND METHODS Electronic searches of MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were conducted. Selected inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to limit the search. Data were analyzed statistically with simple and multivariate random-effects Poisson regressions. RESULTS Seventy-three articles qualified for inclusion in the study. Screw-retained prostheses showed a tendency toward and significantly more technical complications than cemented prostheses with single crowns and fixed <b>partial</b> <b>prostheses,</b> respectively. Resin chipping and ceramic veneer chipping had high mean event rates, at 10. 04 and 8. 95 per 100 years, respectively, for full-arch screwed prostheses. For "all fixed prostheses" (prosthesis type not reported or not known), significantly fewer biologic and technical complications were seen with screw retention. Multivariate analysis revealed a significantly greater incidence of technical complications with cemented prostheses. Full-arch prostheses, cantilevered prostheses, and "all fixed prostheses" had significantly higher complication rates than single crowns. A significantly greater incidence of technical and biologic complications was seen with cemented prostheses. CONCLUSION Screw-retained fixed <b>partial</b> <b>prostheses</b> demonstrated a significantly higher rate of technical complications and screw-retained full-arch prostheses demonstrated a notably high rate of veneer chipping.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the implant survival and the implant-crown success of implants with surface treated with organic acids. Materials and methods: A total of 273 implants (Implus®, Leader-Novaxa, Milan, Italy) were inserted in 63 patients, from June 2006 to June 2010, in a single clinical centre. In each annual follow up session, clinical, radiographic and prosthetic parameters were evaluated. The implant-crown success criteria included the absence of pain, suppuration and clinical mobility, a distance between the implant shoulder and the first visible bone contact (DIB) < 2. 0 mm from the surgery and the absence of prosthetic complications at the implantabutment interface. Prosthetic restorations were 32 fixed <b>partial</b> <b>prostheses,</b> 48 single crowns and 16 fixed full arches. Results: The cumulative survival rate was 95. 70...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{shortened}} {{dental arch}} (SDA) concept {{is a widely}} accepted strategy to avoid overtreatment, little is known on its impact on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). This multicenter randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the OHRQoL for removable <b>partial</b> dental <b>prostheses</b> (RPDP) with molar replacement versus the SDA concept...|$|R
