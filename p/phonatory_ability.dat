40|$|An {{in-depth}} {{investigation of a}} 55 -year-old woman with spastic dysphonia was performed. The findings  from otological, neurological and psychological investigations assisted in making a differential diagnosis and served to provide evidence for  the etiology of this disorder. Subjective-perceptual evaluations of  the voice revealed a strained, harsh-breathy voice quality with frequent  breaks in phonation, a variable pitch and visible tension {{in the face and}} neck muscles. Objective spectrographic evaluations revealed much turbulence, ill-defined  harmonics, a breakdown in formant structure, rapid pitch fluctuations  and evidence of diplophonia, which was confirmed on a fiberscopic examination. Post-treatment spectrographic evaluations indicated an improved <b>phonatory</b> <b>ability</b> with significant improvement in the above parameters. Results are discussed in terms of  the etiology and symptomatology of  this disorder; and clinical implications for diagnosis and treatment are considered...|$|E
40|$|Aim of this {{investigation}} was to analyse the voice in a group of 20 patients submitted to supracricoid partial laryngectomy (cricohyoidopexy, sparing two arytenoids) by the Multi Dimensional Voice Programme acoustic analysis system. Results revealed the following sound characteristics: high rate of noise, lack of periodic component of the signal, high rate of segments with no sound signal, vocal segments with marked air-turbulent flow, variation amplitude and frequency coefficients doubled compared to normal values, average fundamental frequency, if present, extremely variable and unsteady. These results show that the <b>phonatory</b> <b>ability</b> of the residual larynx, due to the altered anatomo-physiology of the structure after surgery, has to be completely re-estimated. In fact, the residual larynx determines a definitely reduced periodic acoustic signal, rich in noise and which can not be modulated. Good phonatory results of this treatment are basically due to preservation of a still understandable (but not perfect!) speech which, by ensuring the subjects’ speech ability, overcomes and has little influence on the really poor quality of the vocal signal in these patients. However, the patient obtains a “new voice” as far as concerns acoustic features and this is very important for communication and social life. Moreover, the possibility of objectively estimating acoustic vocal function ability allows monitoring of the trend and results of possible speech therapy and/or phonosurgical rehabilitation treatment which should start from new anatomical and physiological bases, {{as well as from the}} new physical acoustic mechanism of signal production...|$|E
40|$|Speech {{synthesis}} {{options on}} assistive communication devices are very limited {{and do not}} reflect the user’s vocal quality or personality. Previous work suggests that speakers with severe speech impairment can control prosodic aspects of their voice, and often retain the ability to produce sustained vowel-like utterances. This project leverages these residual <b>phonatory</b> <b>abilities</b> in order to build an adaptive text-to-speech synthesizer that is intelligible, yet conveys the user’s vocal identity. Our VocaliD system combines the source characteristics of the disordered speaker with the filter characteristics of an age-matched healthy speaker using voice transformation techniques, in order to produce a personalized voice. Usability testing indicated that listeners were 94 % accurate in transcribing morphed samples and 79. 5 % accurate in matching morphed samples from the same speaker...|$|R
40|$|It often poses {{difficulty}} in airway management. Commonly described are external laryngeal or blunt injuries. We report {{a case of}} penetrating neck injury resulting in complete transection of cricoid cartilage. A lady presented with a large, deep slash wound in her neck from a knife injury. There was complete laryngotracheal separation. The airway was secured before she {{was taken to the}} operating theatre. A tracheostomy was performed. Exploration revealed the cricoid ring was cut horizontally into two. Anastomosis of the cartilaginous framework was undertaken. Fibreoptic laryngoscopy showed bilateral vocal cords paralysis. After two months the patient recovered without airway compromise, she regains her voice. Repeat laryngoscopy showed good mobility of the vocal cords. In conclusion surgical reconstruction should be meticulously done to ensure good respiratory and <b>phonatory</b> <b>abilities...</b>|$|R
