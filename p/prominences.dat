40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine {{different}} approaches to obtain judgments of perceptual <b>prominence.</b> We discuss dif-ferent <b>prominence</b> scales, {{the influence of the}} linguistic unit on which <b>prominence</b> is rated and the normalisation of <b>prominence</b> judgments. We propose the use of a multilevel scale for obtaining <b>prominence</b> judgments. It seems that naı̈ve listeners can rate word <b>prominence</b> better than syllable <b>prominence,</b> resulting in better correlations to acoustics. It is shown that normalisation should be applied to the obtained ratings. Index Terms: prosody, <b>prominence,</b> methods, normali-sation, acoustic correlate...|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{varieties}} of topographic prominence: wet <b>prominence</b> and dry <b>prominence.</b> [...] Wet <b>prominence</b> {{is the standard}} topographic <b>prominence</b> discussed in this article. Wet <b>prominence</b> assumes that {{the surface of the}} earth includes all permanent water, snow, and ice features. Thus, the wet <b>prominence</b> of the highest summit of an ocean island or landmass is always equal to the summit's elevation.|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{unsupervised}} <b>prominence</b> {{prediction method}} for expressive speech synthesis. <b>Prominence</b> patterns are learned by {{statistical analysis of}} prosodic features extracted from speech data. The advantages of our unsupervised datadriven <b>prominence</b> prediction include: easy adaptation to new speakers, speech styles, and even languages without requiring expert knowledge or complicated linguistic rules. In this approach, first, <b>prominence</b> predictive prosodic features are extracted at the foot level. Next, the extracted prosodic features are clustered, each cluster representing a <b>prominence</b> level. Based on just-noticeable-differences of prosodic features, the optimal number of perceptually distinct <b>prominence</b> levels is determined. Finally, the proposed <b>prominence</b> prediction is applied to prosody prediction for unit selection speech synthesis. Perceptual evaluation results show a preference for a 4 -level unsupervised <b>prominence</b> prediction over a rule-based baseline in terms of naturalness and expressiveness of synthesized speech.

5|$|The spores are 7–9 by 7–9µm, spherical {{or nearly}} so, ornamented with a partial to {{complete}} reticulum (a system of raised, net-like ridges), with <b>prominences</b> up to 0.5µm high. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are both two- and four-spored, and measure 45–52 by 9–11µm. The cap cuticle is a poorly formed layer of inflated cells with scattered filamentous pileocystidia (cystidia on the cap). Somewhat {{unusual for a}} Lactarius, L.rufulus lacks or has few swollen cells (sphaerocysts) in the cap and stem.|$|E
5|$|The spores are spherical, and ornamented with warts and ridges {{that form}} a partial {{reticulum}} (a net-like pattern of lines) with <b>prominences</b> up to 2µm high. They are hyaline (translucent), amyloid (meaning they will absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent), and measure 7.5–10.0 by 7–9.5µm. The cap cuticle is a trichoderm. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) are 38–56 by 10–13µm, club-shaped, four-spored, and hyaline when mounted in a dilute solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH). There are abundant cheilocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} edge of gills), with contents ranging in color from dingy yellow to hyaline in KOH. They measure 32–50 by 3-6µm, and may be shaped somewhat like a spindle (tapered on each end) or a cylinder, or they may be flexuous (winding from side to side). The pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the gill face) are , 2.5–5µm in diameter, and rare to scattered.|$|E
5|$|P. sibiricus is {{the largest}} known species of Psittacosaurus. The skull of the type {{specimen}} is 20.7centimetres long (8.25in), and the femur is 22.3cm (8.75in) in length. It is also distinguished by its neck frill, which is longer than any other species, at 15 to 18% of skull length. A very striking feature of P. sibiricus {{is the number of}} 'horns' around the eyes, with three <b>prominences</b> on each postorbital, and one in front of each eye, on the palpebral bones. Similar horns found on the postorbital of P. sinensis are not as pronounced but may be homologous. The jugal has extremely prominent 'horns' and may contact the premaxilla, both features also seen in the possibly related P. sinensis. There is a flange on the dentary of the lower jaw, similar to P. mongoliensis, P. meileyingensis, and P. sattayaraki. It can be told apart from the other species of Psittacosaurus by a combination of 32 anatomical features, including six that are unique to the species. Most of these are skull details, but one unusual feature is the presence of 23 vertebrae between the skull and pelvis, unlike the 21 or 22 in the other species where the vertebrae are known.|$|E

40|$|International audienceNuclear <b>prominence</b> is {{assigned}} to a word based on information status in some languages, while its location is fixed {{at the end of}} a phrase in others. We test how this difference affects <b>prominence</b> perception, comparing English, Spanish and French, languages that differ in the strength of the link between informational, positional and acoustic <b>prominence.</b> Using the method of Rapid Prosody Transcription, we compare <b>prominence</b> perception in English Spanish and French in relation to phrasal position and word frequency (a correlate of information status), and by directing listeners’ attention to acoustic criteria or to informational (“meaning-based” criteria). <b>Prominence</b> annotations were collected for spontaneous speech excerpts from 30 listeners of each language. Statistical results of mixed-effect regression show that word frequency as an informational factor most strongly influences <b>prominence</b> ratings for English, where <b>prominence</b> is the primary expression of information status. But despite differences in the phrasal location of nuclear <b>prominence</b> among these languages, the structural factor of adjacency to a prosodic boundary uniformly influences <b>prominence</b> perception based on acoustic criteria in all languages. Listeners in all three languages tend to perceive an acoustically-cued structural <b>prominence</b> on the phrase-final word, suggesting the primacy of a structural nuclear <b>prominence</b> in prosodic theory...|$|R
40|$|This paper compares <b>prominence</b> that {{listeners}} perceive {{with actual}} articulatory <b>prominence.</b> We calculated phrasal boundaries from articulatory patterns using an algorithm of the C/D model, and compared those calculated boundaries with perceived boundaries. The jaw displacements, measures of <b>prominence,</b> were measured using EMA; articulatory boundaries {{were derived from}} a C/D model algorithm. The data {{is a set of}} English sentences that vary in the placement of contrastive emphasis. Perception data were obtained from listeners who were asked to evaluate syllable <b>prominence</b> and syllable boundaries for these sentences. The results indicate that perception of syllable <b>prominence</b> shows strong correlations with articulatory <b>prominence,</b> showing that jaw displacement can be a strong perceptual cue for syllable <b>prominence.</b> Further, perception of syllable <b>prominence</b> is also correlated with algorithmically-calculated articulatory syllable boundaries. These results encourage us to explore the relation between articulation and perception of language prosody in terms of the C/D model framework...|$|R

25|$|A good {{description}} of Seutin’s technique {{was provided by}} Sampson Gamgee who learned it from Seutin in France {{during the winter of}} 1851–52 and went on to promote its use in Britain. The limb was initially wrapped in wool, especially over any bony <b>prominences.</b> Pasteboard was then cut into shape to provide a splint and dampened down in order that it could be molded to the limb. The limb was then wrapped in bandages before a starch coating was applied to the outer surface. Seutin’s technique for the application of the starch apparatus formed the basis of the technique used with plaster of Paris dressings today. The use of this method led to the early mobilization of patients with fractures and a marked reduction in hospital time required.|$|E

40|$|Intonational <b>prominence,</b> or accent, is a {{fundamental}} prosodic feature that is said to contribute to discourse meaning. This thesis outlines a new, computational theory of the discourse interpretation of <b>prominence,</b> from a FUNCTIONAL PROSODY perspective. Functional prosody makes the following two important assumptions: first, there is an aspect of <b>prominence</b> interpretation that centrally concerns discourse processes, namely the discourse focusing nature of prominence; and second, the role of <b>prominence</b> in language processing in general, and discourse processing in particular, is not essentially separate from the processing of other grammatical, nonprosodic information. This thesis develops a computational theory of <b>prominence</b> interpretation by explaining how <b>prominence</b> serves as an inference cue in discourse processing. <b>Prominence</b> signals changes in the attentional status of entities in a discourse model, while nonprominence signals that the realized entities are already in discourse fo [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} {{the role that}} linguistic and cognitive <b>prominence</b> play in the resolution of anaphor–antecedent relationships. In two experiments, we found that pronouns are immediately sensitive to the cognitive <b>prominence</b> of potential antecedents when other antecedent selection cues are uninformative. In experiment 1, results suggest that despite their theoret-ical dissimilarities, topic and contrastive focus both serve to enhance cognitive <b>prominence.</b> Results from experi-ment 2 suggest that the contrastive prosody appropriate for focus constructions may also {{play an important role}} in enhancing cognitive <b>prominence.</b> Thus different types of linguistic <b>prominence</b> (topic, contrastive focus) ap-pear to have the common effect of increasing the cog-nitive <b>prominence</b> of the discourse referent. For pronouns with two possible antecedents, the cognitive <b>prominence</b> of an antecedent aids in anaphor resolution, immediately biasing selection towards the more promi-nent (and ultimately preferred) antecedent...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} explored {{discourse and}} communicative {{factors that contribute}} to the perceived <b>prominence</b> of a word in an utterance, and how that <b>prominence</b> is realized acoustically. In Experiment 1 two hypotheses were tested: (1) acoustic <b>prominence</b> {{is a product of the}} given-new status of a word and (2) acoustic <b>prominence</b> depends on the degree to which a referent is accessible, where greater acoustic <b>prominence</b> is used for less accessible entities. In a referential communication task, speakers used acoustic <b>prominence</b> to indicate referent accessibility change, independent of given-new status. In Experiment 2 a variant of Tic Tac Toe was used to investigate whether effects of accessibility are driven by a need to signal the importance of a word or to indicate the word’s predictability. The results indicate that both importance and predictability contribute to the <b>prominence</b> of a word, but in different ways. 1...|$|R
