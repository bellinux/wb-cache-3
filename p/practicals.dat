25|$|Director of {{photography}} was Ulf Brantås, who {{started his career}} as a cinematographer for Roy Andersson and had filmed both of Moodysson's previous feature films. Lilya 4-ever was shot with an Aaton XTR Prod on 16mm film which was later transferred to 35mm. Minimum lighting was used, mainly from <b>practicals</b> and whenever possible only sunlight. Locations were only sparsely rigged by the crew. A custom built rickshaw, made from the wheels of a mountain bike, was used for the long rearward-facing tracking shots. No correction filters were used though the stock was eventually graded in post-production in order to appear slightly warmer.|$|E

2500|$|The {{academic}} {{situation in}} the college was about average. Like in most engineering colleges of the University of Mumbai, most of the emphasis was on theory exams that constitute [...] "external assessment" [...] of the curriculum.

2500|$|Darwin {{also took}} the popular natural history course of Professor Robert Jameson, {{learning}} about stratigraphic geology. Jameson was a Neptunian geologist who taught that strata had precipitated from a universal ocean: he held debates with chemistry professor Thomas Charles Hope who held that granites had crystallised from molten crust, ideas {{influenced by the}} Plutonism of James Hutton who had been Hope's friend. Jameson's view was that [...] "It would be a misfortune if we all had the same way of thinking... Dr Hope is decidedly opposed to me, and I am opposed to Dr Hope, and between us we make the subject interesting." [...] Darwin liked Hope and found Jameson a boring speaker. It is not known what he made of Jameson's closing lectures on the [...] "Origin of the Species of Animals". Darwin enjoyed <b>practicals</b> in the Museum and course field trips, learning the sequence of strata. The Museum of Edinburgh University was Jameson's preserve and was {{then one of the}} largest in Europe. Darwin assisted and made full use of the collections, spending hours studying, taking notes and stuffing animal specimens.|$|E
6000|$|I {{must not}} trouble {{the reader with}} the tedious tale of the pains and the labour which {{accompany}} the accouchement of such an Expedition. All <b>practicals</b> know that to organize a movement of sixty men is not less troublesome--indeed, rather more so--than if it numbered six hundred or six thousand. The Viceroy had wisely determined {{that we should not}} only carry out the work of discovery by tracing the precious metals to their source; but, also, that we should bring back specimens weighing tons enough for assay and analysis, quantitive and qualitive, in London and Paris. Consequently, miners and mining apparatus were wanted, with all the materials for quarrying and blasting: my spirit sighed for dynamite, but experiments at Trieste had shown it to be too dangerous. The party was to consist of an escort numbering twenty-five Súdán soldiers of the Line, negroes liberated some two years ago; a few Ma'danjiyyah ("mine-men"), and thirty Haggárah ("stone-men" [...] or quarrymen).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Practical</b> atheism is {{the view}} that one should live their life with {{disregard}} towards a god. <b>Practical</b> atheism doesn't reject or accept claims about god. [...] <b>Practical</b> atheism has been mistaken with apatheism and pragmatic atheism. Apatheism sees the god question as irrelevant while <b>practical</b> atheism does not. Since <b>practical</b> atheism doesn't address the god claim one can be both a theist and a <b>practical</b> atheist.|$|R

60|$|Suppose, for example, {{that the}} {{question}} were, whether absolute kings were likely to employ the powers of government for the welfare or for the oppression of their subjects. The <b>practicals</b> would endeavour to determine this question by a direct induction from the conduct of particular despotic monarchs, as testified by history. The theorists would refer the question {{to be decided by}} the test not solely of our experience of kings, but of our experience of men. They would contend that an observation of the tendencies which human nature has manifested in the variety of situations in which human beings have been placed, and especially observation of what passes in our own minds, warrants us in inferring that a human being in the situation of a despotic king will make a bad use of power; and that this conclusion would lose nothing of its certainty even if absolute kings had never existed, or if history furnished us with no information of {{the manner in which they}} had conducted themselves.|$|E

40|$|Action {{research}} {{is now a}} well established research approach within information systems. Action {{research is}} defined as having dual purposes; contributing to changes in a local practice and to the scientific body of knowledge. It is often seen as way to ensure <b>practical</b> relevance in the research. However, in the definitions of action research nothing is explicitly said {{about the need to}} develop general knowledge of <b>practical</b> relevance and usefulness. As an alternative and a complement to action research, another research approach is elaborated: <b>practical</b> inquiry. This approach relies on pragmatic philosophy. <b>Practical</b> inquiry shares many similarities with action research, but there are some important differences. The purpose of a <b>practical</b> inquiry is, through empirical study on <b>practical</b> matters in local practices, to contribute to general <b>practical</b> knowledge. This <b>practical</b> knowledge {{will be part of the}} scientific body of knowledge and it aims to be useful for <b>practical</b> affairs. In many situations, <b>practical</b> inquiry will also include intervention, of varying degrees, into the studied local practices. The general <b>practical</b> knowledge is often formulated as <b>practical</b> theories. Purposes and constituents of <b>practical</b> theories are described. An illustration of a combined <b>practical</b> inquiry and action research study is described in the paper...|$|R
