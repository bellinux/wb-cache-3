50|$|The movie explores Monsanto, {{the major}} United States {{chemical}} manufacturing {{firm based in}} St. Louis, Missouri. With offices and plants in 46 countries, Monsanto has become the world leader in GMO (genetically modified organisms). The firm also has produced PCBs (such as <b>pyralene),</b> herbicides (such as Agent Orange during the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War), and the recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), used to increase milk production in cows. Europe has prohibited the use of rBGH in its dairy cattle and milk production.|$|E
5000|$|A law of January 1986 {{contained}} {{a number of}} changes regarding workers' right to express their views. The obligation to negotiate agreements {{on the way in}} which this right is exercised, which used to be limited to firms employing at least 200 workers, was extended to all businesses where trade unions had established one or more sections and appointed a shop steward. The obligation to negotiate did not, however, apply to firms without trade union representations and with less than 50 workers, even if a staff representative had been appointed as trade union delegate. A law of February 1986 amending the labour code included various changes e.g. to ensure that wage-earners received a stable income, independent of fluctuations in weekly working hours. A decree on the protection of workers exposed to benzene was issued on February 1986 with the purpose of simplifying and updating the relevant regulations, most of which dated back to 1939. A decree was issued in March 1986 which amended certain provisions in the Labour Code concerning substances and preparations hazardous to workers, thus transferring into national law the provisions of the Council Directive 79/831/EEC amending for the sixth time Directive 67/548/EEC on the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances. The procedures for forwarding documents concerning inspections and verifications for health and safety purposes were laid down in a decree dated 13 March 1986. A further decree, issued that same year, laid down the health and safety requirements to be met by mobile agricultural and forestry machinery, while a further decree issued on the same date related to the protection of workers exposed to methyl bromide. A decree of January 1986 covers the flooring of fixed scaffolding while a decree of March 1986 laid down the health and safety requirements to be met by mobile agricultural and forestry machinery. A circular of January 1986 on the labelling and packaging of chemical products for industrial use defined the scope of the 1983 decrees on the labelling of chemical products and {{contained a}} [...] "guide to EEC packaging". Following a number of accidents involving <b>pyralene</b> transformers, a circular of March 1986 on the hazards associated with <b>pyralene</b> and its decomposition products sets out, for the inspection officers involved, the risks associated with such products, the sectors most at risk, the elementary precautions to be taken, and the regulations to be applied.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{tested the}} effect of {{temperature}} on the survival of rainb ow trout iSalmo gairdneri) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) egg s. In both these species, a rise in temperature reduced the fertile life of the eggs. In the rainbow trout, temperature apparently only increased metabolism because the eggs retained the same fertilizability for {{the same number of}} degrees/days, whether the temperature was 10 or 20 degree C. In the brown trout, a 15 degree C temperature was rapidly lethal for the eggs; fertilizability loss was quicke and higher at 15 degree C that at 10 degree C for the same number of degrees/days. The effects of temperature on the gamete survival of both these species were also tested after the incorporation of increasing doses of lindane and <b>pyralene</b> 3010 (P CB) in the diluter. In the rainbow trout at 10 degree C the lindane, applied for 20 and 40 min, at doses of 0. 25, 2. 5 and 25 ppm, was not toxic for the eggs; on the other hand, fertilizability decreased sign ificantly (P < 0. 01) at 20 degree F...|$|E
40|$|The {{idea that}} the earth is a closed system and that soil, like other mediums, is {{polluted}} by human activities, is very recent, hardly thirty years old. The chief preoccupation has been with water pollution, a conviction that, sooner or later, all the pollutants found in water were the principal cause {{of the emergence of}} aquatic ecotoxicology. Yet, the existence of polluted soils has been cited since ancient times. Greek and Roman writers remarked that the contamination of water and air near mines had adverse effects on plants, domestic animals, and humans. But soil pollution is not as visible as water pollution, and to acknowledge that soils can be polluted goes against the belief—still very widespread—that they have an unlimited capacity to purify themselves. Perceptions have evolved: DDT pollution, the Seveso catastrophe (1976), urban pollution by <b>pyralene</b> electric trans¬formers (Reims, 1985; Villeurbanne, 1986), and the nuclear fallout at Cher¬nobyl (1986) have clearly shown that environmental pollution is general and that it affects soil as well as other mediums. Ancient practices, such as the spreading of purifying mud around farming areas, earlier con¬sidered a wasteful agricultural amendment, are now being considered again. The quality of soils is of great importance, as emphasized in the report of INSA/INRA/CRIDEAU/CNRS (I 2 C 2, 1994) ...|$|E
40|$|Industrial {{exposure}} to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and internal dose were investigated in 80 worker exposed {{for many years}} to PCB mixtures with a 42 % chlorine content (<b>Pyralene</b> 3010 and Apirolio). PCBs were determined by liquid gas chromatography on samples taken from workroom air, workroom surfaces and tools, the palms of the hand, and the blood of the workers. In the workroom air samples, PCB concentrations ranged from 48 to 275 micrograms/m 3. All tested surfaces and tools were heavily contaminated, with a range from 0. 2 to 159 micrograms PCBs per cm 2 of surface. Considerable amounts of PCBs were detected on the palms of the hands of the workers (2 - 28 microgram/cm 2 of skin surface). In blood, total PCB concentrations from 88 to 1319 micrograms/kg were observed: comparing the blood concentrations of low and high chlorine content biphenyls, a significant difference was found for the low-chlorinated biphenyl concentrations between workers currently exposed and workers exposed only in the past. In groups of workers who were homogeneous as regards work area and job, the PCB concentrations in the blood were closely correlated with the length of actual occupational {{exposure to}} these compounds. These findings led to the conclusion that absorption of PCBs in these workers had occurred mainly through the skin, therefore industrial preventive surveillance must take this route of exposure into account. Since blood PCB concentrations appear to be correlated with the length of exposure, PCB determination on whole blood may be used to monitor industrial and environmental exposure to PCBs...|$|E
