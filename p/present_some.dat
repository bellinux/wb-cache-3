5|$|At <b>present,</b> <b>some</b> 192 spells are known, {{though no}} single {{manuscript}} contains them all. They served {{a range of}} purposes. Some are intended to give the deceased mystical knowledge in the afterlife, or perhaps to identify them with the gods: for instance, Spell 17 is an obscure and lengthy description of the god Atum. Others are incantations to ensure the different elements of the dead person's being were preserved and reunited, and to give the deceased control over the world around him. Still others protect the deceased from various hostile forces or guide him through the underworld past various obstacles. Famously, two spells also deal with the judgement of the deceased in the Weighing of the Heart ritual.|$|E

5|$|Giganotosaurus was {{discovered}} in the Candeleros Formation, which was deposited during the Early Cenomanian age of the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 98 to 97 million years ago, although Holtz provided an earlier lower bound for its age of 99.6 million years. This formation is the lowest unit in the Neuquén Group, wherein {{it is part of}} the Río Limay Subgroup. The formation is composed of coarse and medium-grained sandstones deposited in a fluvial environment (associated with rivers and streams), and in aeolian conditions (effected by wind). Paleosols (buried soil), siltstones, and claystones are <b>present,</b> <b>some</b> of which represent swamp conditions.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the San Juan {{watershed}} supported up to 12 invertebrate species, 5 fish species, 12 amphibian species, 35 reptile species, 143 bird species, and 42 mammal species, which {{benefited from}} the diverse vegetation communities <b>present.</b> <b>Some</b> streams and ponds host federally listed endangered/threatened species such as tidewater goby, fairy shrimp, and California red-legged frog. Federally listed bird species include least Bell's vireo, California gnatcatcher, California least tern, and southwestern willow flycatcher. Other listed species include Pacific pocket mouse and Quino checkerspot butterfly. As urbanization continues to increase in the San Juan watershed, most sensitive species have been pushed back to the foothills, mountains, and agricultural/ranching areas of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases where}} there was {{unconscious}} guilt associated with the relationship, the wish for reunion may be subverted by anxiety. This may lead to repression, which Sigmund Freud had linked {{with the development of}} morbid dread. Jones surmised in this case the original wish of a (sexual) reunion may be drastically changed: desire is replaced by fear; love is replaced by sadism, and the object or loved one is replaced by an unknown entity. The sexual aspect {{may or may not be}} <b>present.</b> <b>Some</b> modern critics have proposed a simpler theory: People identify with immortal vampires because, by so doing, they overcome, or at least temporarily escape from, their fear of dying.|$|E

Larson also notes that Tubman may have begun sharing Frederick Douglass's doubts about the viability of the plan.|$|E

Because of this core difference, CPM and PERT are used in different contexts. These mathematical techniques quickly spread into many private enterprises.|$|E
