40|$|The Qing 淸 {{government}} often {{announced that}} it transferred han 漢 elite officials from central posts (han-lin-guany 翰林官 and ke-dao-guan科道官) to local posts (dao-yuan 道員) {{on a large scale}} in shun-zhi 順治 era. This also included that they could return to high ranking central officials (jing-tang 京堂) after their experiences as local officials. This article calls it nei-wai-hu-yong 內外互用. Such a <b>personal</b> <b>transfer</b> aimed at making the new elite course and overthrowing the former custom of promotions. 748 On the other hand, nei-sheng-wai-zhuan 內陞外轉was the former promotion course of han漢elite officials. This system promoted a few han elite officials from ke-dao-guan to jing-tang 京堂 or dao-yuan 道員 annually. For this reason, there was a conflict over official posts between nei-wai-hu-yong and nei-sheng-gai-zhuan. This article researches whether the <b>personal</b> <b>transfer</b> through nei-wai-hu-yong could achieve its aim or not. The essence is as follows. When nei-wai-hu-yong was carried out, it shocked han elite officials very much. They feared that this <b>personal</b> <b>transfer</b> meant dropping out from elite course. In fact, although the Qing government made effort to push nei-wai-hu-yong, real use of personnel appointment tended to preserve former nei-sheng-gai-zhuan. Comparing nei-wai-huyong with nei-sheng-gai-zhuan, nei-sheng-gai-zhuan was given good treatmentobviously. Even rules of personnel appointment ordered that ke-dao-guan of neisheng- gai-zhuan took priority over officials of nei-wai-hu-yong in personnel appointment. Officials of nei-wai-hu-yong were made to stand in disadvantageous situation clearly. These viewpoints show firm stability of han officialʼs elite course. Each official post was given proper rank for each han officialʼs situation, and he was promoted to proper official post for his situation. Preserving such a personnel appointment was shared by han officials as norm, and it supported stability of bureaucratic organization. Han officialʼs norm for personnel appointment decided whether the policy of <b>personal</b> <b>transfer</b> succeeded or not...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePersonal {{transfers}} (often called Constructed Actions or role shifts, Metzger 1995; Lillo-Martin 2012; Cormier, Smith & Sevcikova, in press) {{are very}} frequent structures in sign language discourse (Cuxac & Sallandre 2007). These structures involve the signer’s whole body to reproduce {{one or more}} actions carried out or sustained by an entity {{in the course of}} the utterance. The entities are usually human or animal but can also be inanimate. The movements of the signer’s body and face, the direction of eye gaze and facial expression represent those of the transferred entity. The handshape and orientation of the signer-narrator’s hands portray the basic form of an action (movement of the hand(s), e. g. grasping, walking). Furthermore, some of these structures can be combined together, for example when two entities are expressed simultaneously in a same structure (a double transfer in our terminology; multiple references in Dudis 2004). The present study uses data from five sign languages: French, Italian, Romanian, Flemish and Japanese sign languages (Cuxac et al 2002; Sallandre & L’Huillier 2011; Di Renzo 2015; Gavrilescu 2014; Daniel 2015; Van Herreweghe, Vermeerbergen et al 2015). Our corpora are made of narratives performed by five Deaf adults in each language (n= 25 signers). The stories are based on the same stimuli (a picture story (the Horse) and Tom and Jerry cartoons), and are therefore fully comparable. These sign languages are all visuo-gestural languages used by Deaf people, but they share few or no historical links. Four of these share the European culture and Latin alphabet for fingerspelling, while Japanese Sign Language is not correlated and borrows other types of written rules. We hypothesized that the introduction of referents is done through different devices in this language, because of the very different lexical system, but that the re-introduction of referents is done through <b>personal</b> <b>transfers,</b> as the other sign languages do (Pizzuto et al 2008, for a first comparison on ASL, LSF and LIS). Our results showed that signers produced a wide range of <b>personal</b> <b>transfers,</b> averaging at 60 % of the signs produced in each language, regardless of language. Animate entities in our stories (horse, cow, cat, mouse) were typically introduced by a lexical sign, but re-introduce through a personal transfer and/or a pointing gesture. Thus, the strategy of embodiment seems to be very productive in these visuo-gestural languages. This study, conducted on a few samples of sign productions, confirms the similarities between sign languages and the importance of <b>personal</b> <b>transfers</b> for discourse cohesion. The visuo-gestural modality seems to have an impact on the structure/organization of the discourse, particularly on how entities are expressed and embodied in such fully-fledged languages...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} economists {{who argue that}} {{temporary}} tax cuts, {{like those in the}} 2009 stimulus and the ones proposed by President Obama last week, have no impact on the economy. They argue that people will save a temporary tax credit rather than spend it. Stanford Economics Professor John Taylor, who served as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs under President Bush, is one of the economists making this argument. He purports to show that there was no statistically significant increase in private consumption of goods and services as a result of certain types of government transfers made over the last decade. According to his analysis, it is unclear whether an additional dollar of government transfers led to any additional spending, or, alternatively, whether it raised personal savings by more than one dollar. This paper shows that there is very little indication that – based on Taylor’s work – <b>personal</b> <b>transfers</b> from the government fail to stimulate private spending. stimulus, recession, tax cuts...|$|E

International audienceA {{great deal}} of {{research}} on the expression of motion events has been carried out in the spoken languages of children {{and to a lesser extent}} in several signed languages, but never for French Sign Language (LSF). Our study is therefore the first one to compare how children describe motion events in LSF in comparison to spoken French. The corpus stems from a larger database from which we present three case studies concerning one deaf adult and two eight-year-old deaf children. Qualitative analyses show high semantic density in the LSF utterances, marked by the use of two highly iconic structures called transfers. The <b>personal</b> <b>transfers</b> mainly express manner while the situational transfers express both path and manner simultaneously. In contrast, in spoken French, the verb usually expresses path alone, and manner has to be expressed by an external element. In addition, deaf subjects almost systematically link two structures to express two viewpoints on the same motion event, whereas this behaviour is rarely observed in spoken French. In conclusion, this initial study shows few differences between child and adult subjects in LSF but important differences between spoken French and LSF...|$|E
40|$|International audience"Highly iconic" {{structures}} in Sign Language enable a narrator to act, switch characters, describe objects, or report actions in four-dimensions. This group of linguistic structures {{has no real}} spoken-language equivalent. Topographical descriptions are also achieved in a sign-language specific manner via the use of signing-space and spatial-classifier signs. We used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) to compare the neural correlates of topographic discourse and highly iconic {{structures in}} French Sign Language (LSF) in six hearing native signers, children of deaf adults (CODAs), and six LSF-naïve monolinguals. LSF materials consisted of videos of a lecture excerpt signed without spatially organized discourse or highly iconic structures (Lect LSF), a tale signed using highly iconic structures (Tale LSF), and a topographical description using a diagrammatic format and spatial-classifier signs (Topo LSF). We also presented texts in spoken French (Lect French, Tale French, Topo French) to all participants. With both languages, the Topo texts activated several different regions that are involved in mental navigation and spatial working memory. No specific correlate of LSF spatial discourse was evidenced. The same regions were more activated during Tale LSF than Lect LSF in CODAs, but not in monolinguals, in line with the presence of signing-space structure in both conditions. Motion processing areas and parts of the fusiform gyrus and precuneus were more active during Tale LSF in CODAs; no such effect was observed with French or in LSF-naïve monolinguals. These effects may be associated with perspective-taking and acting during <b>personal</b> <b>transfers...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented here}} {{is part of}} a lager project set up to gain an insight in the degree of similarity and divergence between two unrelated sign languages, a Western European sign language, i. e. Flemish Sign Language (VGT), and an African sign language, i. e. South African Sign Language (SASL). This particular study offers a comparison of narratives produced by signers of the two sign languages involved, as well as by South African ‘home signers’ (cf. Goldin-Meadow, 2003). It focuses on referent tracking and includes the analysis of the following mechanisms: expressive role-taking (aka. <b>personal</b> <b>transfers),</b> ‘double transfers’, classifier constructions (aka. situational transfers), the use of space with agreement verbs, formal role-taking, lexical NP’s, and a combination of some of these. The results bear out that there are remarkable similarities between all narratives with regard to a number of the studied referent tracking devices. We suggest that this is related to the ‘de l’eau pétillante’ nature of the data. There is a continuum between two different manifestations of sign language use with on the one end a form which makes maximum use of the possibilities offered by the visual-gestural modality (e. g. iconicity, use of space, simultaneity), called de ‘l’eau pétillante’ (sparkling water), and on the other end a form more resembling oral language non-iconic sequential organisation, called ‘de l’eau plate’ (still water) (Vermeerbergen, 2006). Vermeerbergen et al. (2007) focussed on de l’eau plate of isolated declarative sentences in SASL and VGT which yielded a number of striking differences. However, when studying the sparkling water of narratives as in the present study the similarities are very salient. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the sanctioning of illegal <b>personal</b> data <b>transfers</b> between the EU and the United States after the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the case of Maximilian Schrems v Data Protection Commissioner of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), where the Court invalidated Safe Harbor, a {{mechanism}} specifically designed for <b>personal</b> data <b>transfers</b> to the U. S. The subject is approached {{from the point of}} view of criminal policy with the aim of creating recommendations based on practical arguments and the balancing of different normative considerations. Before the GDPR, Finland has relied solely on criminal sanctions with regard to personal data protection. However, the EU and the growing use of administrative sanctions have started to redefine the Finnish legislative landscape and the traditional views on criminal policy. The administrative fines of the GDPR are a part of this development, forming an interesting research topic along with the current, undeniably complex situation related to transatlantic <b>personal</b> data <b>transfers.</b> The first chapter aims to demonstrate the current issues related to the applicability of the data protection offence. After describing the new developments resulting from the GDPR and the CJEU case of Schrems concerning transatlantic <b>personal</b> data <b>transfers,</b> the administrative fines of the GDPR are assessed in light of the principles of legality, proportionality and culpability. In the final chapters, both criminal and administrative sanctions are assessed and compared with each other by taking into account their effectiveness and the objectives of Finnish criminal policy. As perhaps the majority of transborder data flows occur online, theories of technology regulation are also taken into account. While the administrative fines of the GDPR can be seen as a welcome improvement due to the shortcomings of criminal law as an enforcement method, there are still several issues which need to be addressed. While the EU’s requirement of effectiveness has been assessed by legislators, it seems that proportionality and coherence have not been given as much attention. This, in turn, has led to the inconsistency of sanctions. The Ministry of Justice recently set up a working group whose task is to assess whether there is a need for general legislation concerning punitive administrative sanctions and draft the proposals necessary for the enactment of such legislation. Hopefully this will lead to the development of a more consistent approach to the entire control policy including both criminal penalties and administrative sanctions of a penal nature...|$|R
