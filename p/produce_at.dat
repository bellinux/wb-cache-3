5|$|For {{many years}} Cheadle Hulme was rural countryside, {{made up of}} woods, open land, and farms. The local {{population}} {{was made up of}} farmers and peasants, living in small cottages and working the land under the tenancy of the Lord of the Manor. Most families kept animals for food, grew their own crops, and probably bought and sold <b>produce</b> <b>at</b> Stockport market. Water was obtained from local wells and ponds, and sometimes the Micker Brook.|$|E
5|$|Home {{propagation}} is best {{performed by}} using offset bulbils. Commercially, only cultivars that <b>produce</b> <b>at</b> least three bulbils {{on the mother}} bulb are used for this form of propagation. Plants grown from this method take {{three to four years}} to bloom.|$|E
5|$|If these {{conditions}} are in place, multinational corporations will transfer via their offshore subsidiaries or to their offshore suppliers, the specific production technologies and market linkages necessary {{to participate in}} the global economy. By themselves, developing countries, even if well-educated, cannot <b>produce</b> <b>at</b> the quality levels demanded in high-value-added industries and cannot market what they produce even in low-value-added industries such as textiles or shoes. Put bluntly, multinational companies possess a variety of factors that developing countries must have if they are {{to participate in the}} global economy.|$|E

5|$|Another pitfall trap form {{unrelated}} to the Sarraceniaceae family are the urns of bromeliad leaves that are formed when leaves are tightly packed together in a rosette, collecting water and trapping insects. Unlike Brocchinia reducta, which has been proven to <b>produce</b> <b>at</b> least one digestive enzyme and can therefore be considered carnivorous, the epiphytic Catopsis berteroniana has little evidence supporting the claims that it is carnivorous. It is able to attract and kill prey and the trichomes {{on the surface of}} the leaves can absorb nutrients, but so far no enzyme activity has been detected. It may be that this plant also relies on an internal food web for soft tissue digestion. The same could be said for Paepalanthus bromelioides, though it is a member of Eriocaulaceae and not a bromeliad. It also forms a central water reservoir that has adaptations to attract insects. It, like C. berteroniana, produces no digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July 1954, a {{conversion}} {{proposal for the}} South Dakota-class ships was ordered by the Chairman of the Ship Characteristics Board. The request was made for the ships' speed to be increased to at least 31 knots. To do so, the design staff decided to remove the after turret and use the weight and space gained to install either a set of improved steam turbines or a set of gas turbines. Either system would have to <b>produce</b> <b>at</b> least 256,000shaft horsepower (190 MW)—the minimum requirement to achieve 31knots on the South Dakota hull. Unfortunately, this would have necessitated alterations to the hull form, particularly {{in the rear of}} the ship. Larger propellers were also required, and all four shafts would have had to have been completely rebuilt to accommodate the changes. Estimates for the project ran as high as $40,000,000 per ship, and this did not include the cost of reactivating the ship and upgrades to its electrical and combat systems. As a result, the conversion program was halted.|$|E

5000|$|Arnold {{was the son}} of the {{composer}} Samuel Arnold, and was given an artistic education. In 1794 at the Haymarket Theatre he produced Auld Robin Gray, a musical play in two acts; and this was followed by other works of the same class: Who Pays the Reckoning? <b>produced</b> <b>at</b> the Haymarket in 1795; The Shipwreck, <b>produced</b> <b>at</b> the Drury Lane Theatre in 1796; The Irish Legacy, <b>produced</b> <b>at</b> the Haymarket in 1797; and The Veteran Tar, <b>produced</b> <b>at</b> Drury Lane in 1801. Foul Deeds Will Rise, first played at the Haymarket in 1804, was described by the critic John Genest as [...] "an unnatural mixture of tragedy and farce". The Prior Claim, <b>produced</b> <b>at</b> Drury Lane in 1805, was a comedy written in conjunction with Henry James Pye. Man and Wife, or More Secrets than One, a comedy <b>produced</b> <b>at</b> Drury Lane in 1809, was performed thirty times.|$|R
5|$|Mujaddid Ijaz {{began his}} {{research}} {{work at the}} Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL) in 1966 under Virginia Tech funding contributed to the UNISOR program. UNISOR was a consortium {{at that time of}} 13 institutions whose research scientists were collaborating at Oak Ridge supported by U.S. Energy Department grants together with Oak Ridge Associated Universities, of which Virginia Tech was one. Ijaz's research focused on the discovery of new isotopes using ORNL's High Flux Isotope Reactor. The reactor was built in 1965 with the highest neutron flux of any reactor at the time. It produced more medical isotopes while allowing higher fidelity of materials research than any other reactor available in the U.S. Energy Department's science and energy laboratory system during the 1970s. Ijaz and his colleagues at Oak Ridge, led by Kenneth S.
