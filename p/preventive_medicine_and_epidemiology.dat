Therefore, pharmacists will soon have to provide guidance and raise pharmaceutical questions regarding prescriptions based on patient pharmacogenomic information. The objective {{of this study was}} to clarify Japanese pharmacists&# 39; awareness of pharmacogenetics. We conducted a postal questionnaire survey among 372 pharmacists belonging to Tsuruha Holdings. Available data were collected from 268 pharmacists (male [n= 133], < 40 years old [n= 170], drugstore pharmacists [n= 182]). Of the pharmacists, 19. 0 % of the population were aware of the Ethical Guidelines for Human Genome/Gene Analysis Research in Japan, 31. 0 % of the population had heard either or both the terms “pharmacogenomics” and “pharmacogenetics”, and 16. 8 % of the population were aware that health insurance covered pharmacogenomic tests performed before prescription in Japan. Only 0. 4 % indicated that they could raise pharmaceutical questions regarding prescriptions based on patients&# 39; pharmacogenomic information, and 61. 2 % of the population indicated a preference to undertake pharmacogenomic tests to predict the efficacy or adverse reactions of a drug. We found a need for actions to improve the awareness of pharmacists about pharmacogenetics and create an environment in which pharmacists are able to provide appropriate medical service based on pharmacogenomic information.

Both require a robust evidence base, and each stands to benefit from applying the methods of the other. There is an exponentially growing literature reporting associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and increased risk for diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Literature-based meta-analysis is an important method of assessing the validity of published gene-disease associations, but a traditional emphasis on exhaustiveness {{makes it difficult to}} study multiple polymorphisms efficiently. Here we describe a novel two-step search method for broadly yet systematically reviewing the literature to identify the &quot;most-studied&quot; gene-disease associations, thereby selecting those with a high possibility of replication on which to conduct abbreviated, simultaneous meta-analyses. This method was then applied to identify and evaluate the validity of SNPs reported to be associated with increased type 2 diabetes risk, to demonstrate proof of principle. Methods: A two-step MEDLINE search (1950 to present) was conducted in September 2007 for published genetic association data related to SNPs associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. The top 10 &quot;most-studied&quot; genes were selected for focused searches and final inclusion/exclusion determinations. To demonstrate the ability to efficiently update this two-step search for additions to the literature, an update of the second-step search was conducted 9 months later. Abstracted data were sorted based on study design, risk model, and specific SNPs. Meta-analyses were performed for individual SNPs, with separate analyses done for case-control and prospective studies, and were compared with the results of more recent genome-wide association studies. Results: The first-step search found 1116 articles covering 108 different genes. The top ten &quot;most-studied&quot; genes were: ABCC 8 (or SUR 1), ACE, CAPN 10, KCNJ 11 (or Kir 6. 2), HNF 1 alpha, HNF 4 alpha, IL- 6, PGC- 1 alpha, PPAR gamma 2, and TCF 7 L 2. The second-step search found a total of 658 articles, yielding 124 articles for initial data abstraction and analysis. We also demonstrated the ability to update this search as newer studies appeared, using the same method almost a year later to find an additional 107 articles (77 were ultimately excluded), bringing the number of included studies to 154. From these studies, data on 90 different DNA variants within the ten genes were abstracted. Simultaneous meta-analyses found that higher-risk alleles for SNPs rs 7903146 and rs 12255372 in TCF 7 L 2, rs 1801282 in PPAR gamma 2, rs 5219 in KCNJ 11, rs 3792267 in CAPN 10, rs 2144909 in HNF 4 alpha, and rs 1800795 in IL- 6 appeared to be associated with increased type 2 diabetes risk. These findings were generally highly concordant with the results of traditional literature-based meta-analyses performed for individual genes. Conclusions: The methodology described in this manuscript represents a reasonable approach to more rapidly identifying and evaluating frequently studied genetic-risk markers for diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Comparison with results of traditional meta-analyses suggests that these gains in efficiency do not necessarily come at the price of reduced accuracy. Given the quickening pace of discovery of such markers, more efficient, unbiased, and readily updatable methods for systematically assessing and re-assessing a changing literature could prove valuable. Good methods for evidence evaluation are also important to the potential application of genetic markers to comparative {{effectiveness research}}, and vice versa.

40|$|Abstract Background Research in {{the fields}} of <b>Preventive</b> <b>Medicine,</b> Occupational/Environmental <b>Medicine,</b> <b>Epidemiology</b> <b>and</b> Public Health play an {{important}} role in the advancement of knowledge. In order to map the research production around the world we performed a bibliometric analysis in the above fields. Methods All articles published by different world regions in the above mentioned scientific fields and cited in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) database of the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) during the period 1995 and 2003, were evaluated. The research production of different world regions was adjusted for: a) the gross domestic product in 1995 US dollars, and b) the population size of each region. Results A total of 48, 861 articles were retrieved and categorized. The USA led the research production in all three subcategories. The percentage of articles published by USA researchers was 43 %, 44 % and 61 % in the <b>Preventive</b> <b>Medicine,</b> <b>Epidemiology,</b> <b>and</b> Public Health subcategories, respectively. Canada and Western Europe shared the second position in the first two subcategories, while Oceania researchers ranked second in the field of Public Health. Conclusion USA researchers maintain a leadership position in the production of scientific articles {{in the fields}} of <b>Preventive</b> <b>Medicine,</b> Occupational/Environmental <b>Medicine</b> <b>and</b> <b>Epidemiology,</b> at a level similar to other scientific disciplines, while USA contribution to science in the field of Public Health is by all means outstanding.

40|$|Epidemiology is {{the main}} {{supplier}} of "bases of action" for <b>preventive</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> health promotion. <b>Epidemiology</b> <b>and</b> epidemiologists therefore have a responsibility {{not only for the}} quality and soundness of the risk estimates they deliver and for the way they are interpreted and used, but also for their consequences. In the industrialised world, the value of, and fascination with health is greater than ever, and the revelation from epidemiological research of new hazards and risks, conveyed to the public by the media, has become almost an every-day phenomenon. This "risk epidemic" in the modern media is paralleled in professional medical journals. It is in general endorsed by health promoters as a necessary foundation for increased health awareness and a desirable impetus for people {{to take responsibility for their}} own health through behavioural changes. Epidemiologists and health promoters, however, have in general not taken the possible side effects of increased risk awareness seriously enough. By increasing anxiety regarding disease, accidents and other adverse events, the risk epidemic enhances both health care dependence and health care consumption. More profoundly, and perhaps even more seriously, it changes the way people think about health, disease and death [...] and ultimately and at least potentially, their perspective on life more generally. The message from the odds ratios from epidemiological research advocates a rationalistic, individualistic, prospective life perspective where maximising control and minimising uncertainty is seen as a superior goal. The inconsistency between applying an expanded health concept, comprising elements of coping, self-realisation and psycho-physical functioning, and imposing intolerance to risk and uncertainty, is regularly overlooked. Acceptance and tolerance of risk and uncertainty, which are inherent elements of human life, is a prerequisite for coping and self-realisation. A further shift away from traditional working-class values like sociability, sharing, conviviality and tolerance can not be imposed without unwanted side effects on culture and human interaction. The moral and coercive crusade for increased risk awareness and purity in life style can too readily take on the form of cultural imperialism towards conformity. Epidemiologists and the health care movement in general have a mandate to fight disease and premature death; they have no explicit mandate to change culture. epidemiology risk health social class culture...|$|R
