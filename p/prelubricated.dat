40|$|Purpose: We {{compared}} {{the safety and}} patient acceptance of a conventional Nelaton and a <b>prelubricated</b> nonhydrophilic catheter in 18 spinal cord injured patients on intermittent catheterization. Materials and Methods: In a prospective crossover study each catheter was used for 7 weeks and the initial course was randomized. Urinalyisis and urine culture were performed at 2, 4 and 7 weeks. Urethral trauma was evaluated by urethral cell count {{on the surface of}} each catheter used {{on the last day of}} each study period. Patient satisfaction was assessed at the end of the study by a questionnaire using multiple visual analog scales. Results: Urinary tract infection was identified in 12 and 4 patients on a Nelaton and a <b>prelubricated</b> nonhydrophilic catheter (p = 0. 03), while asymptomatic bacteruria was identified in 18 and 8 (p = 0. 0244), respectively. The mean urethral cell count, plus or minus standard deviation on the catheter surface was 6. 7 +/- 2. 8 x 10 (4) and 15. 1 +/- 8. 9 x 10 (4) for the <b>prelubricated</b> nonhydrophilic and the Nelaton catheter, respectively (p = 0. 01). The <b>prelubricated</b> nonhydrophilic catheter resulted in a better mean satisfaction score than the Nelaton catheter (2. 33 +/- 1. 06 versus 4. 72 +/- 2. 13, p = 0. 022). Urethral bleeding was reported in 2 patients during the study period while using the Nelaton catheter. Conclusions: The <b>prelubricated</b> nonhydrophilic catheter is a safe, effective and comfortable option in spinal cord injured patients on intermittent self-catheterization...|$|E
40|$|The AIDS crisis, the {{increase}} in other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and the continuing problem of unwanted pregnancies, necessitate new methods of barrier protection. In 1988, Wisconsin Pharmacal began testing the safety and efficacy of a new female condom (Reality), a disposable, <b>prelubricated,</b> polyurethane device that is both a contraceptive and a barrier against STDs. The product requires no professional fitting and is inserted by the woman. Preliminary data from clinical and laboratory studies indicate that the female condom may be an effective barrier against STDs. A widespread use of the female condom, however, will depend on women's and men's initial attitudes, including culturally determined barriers to acceptance...|$|E
40|$|Much {{evidence}} supports {{the hypothesis that}} surface-active phospholipid (SAPL), which imparts the thin hydrophobic outermost lining to the normal articular surface, is the boundary lubricant reducing friction to remarkably low levels. We review this evidence and further hypothesize that SAPL produced in type B synoviocytes will also lubricate prostheses after implantation. This could explain why implanted hips display far less wear than hips in simulated wear trials do, even using protein as the lubricant whereas rougher surfaces can be tolerated in vivo. We introduce the concept that a deficiency of SAPL might explain the selective failure of prostheses just as osteoarthritic articular surfaces are deficient. This, in turn, leads to the replenishment of SAPL, as tested in OA, {{and the concept of}} <b>prelubricating</b> prostheses before implantation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to evaluate patient openness to changing {{and satisfaction with}} catheters used in intermittent catheterisation (IC) for urinary retention from neurogenic bladder dysfunction, and to compare patient response to conventional catheters and a novel packaged hydrophilic catheter: LoFric Primo. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 409 patients recruited, 378 (283 males, 95 females; mean age: 43. 5 yr) completed a 12 -d trial of the novel catheter. The diagnoses were spinal cord lesion in 65. 6 %, multiple sclerosis in 9. 6 %, spina bifida in 2. 3 %, and other neurologic conditions in 22. 5 %; the mean duration of IC was 4. 6 yr. Patients evaluated their current catheter at recruitment and the novel catheter after the 2 -wk trial by questionnaire. Patient satisfaction was expressed on a Visual Analogue Scale for seven topics covering use and general satisfaction. RESULTS: Of the 378 patients, 55. 2 % were happy {{to continue with the}} novel device, which was 74 % of patients using standard polyvinyl chloride (PVC) catheters and 36 % of those using <b>prelubricated</b> PVC (p= 0. 04). No individual patient factors were found to be significant in catheter choice. For the whole study population "ability to comply with daily life activities" was maintained with the novel product despite handling and general satisfaction being found more troublesome. CONCLUSIONS: The main finding was that more than 50 % of the patients wished to continue with the novel catheter and reported increased satisfaction regarding introduction of the catheter, handling, time spent, perception of IC, general satisfaction, and ability to cope with daily life...|$|E
