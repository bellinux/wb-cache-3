500|$|With the {{championship}} returning to Asia {{for the second}} round of flyaway races, the team arrived in Singapore confident of scoring points; despite both cars advancing to the second period of qualifying and running in the top ten throughout the race, both cars retired with gearbox problems. Alonso was forced out after his car kept selecting neutral without input—a problem that affected several drivers; Button was involved in contact with Pastor Maldonado while trying to pass the slow-moving Alexander Rossi during a safety car restart before his gearbox overheated. After experimenting with a new front wing designed to improve air flow around the front tyres during free practice in Singapore, the team introduced the parts at the next race in Japan one week later. However, the team struggled with tyre pressures; following Sebastian Vettel's high-speed tyre blow-out during the Belgian Grand Prix, the FIA introduced a mandatory minimum tyre <b>pressure</b> <b>setting</b> on the advice of tyre supplier Pirelli. For the Japanese Grand Prix, these pressures were raised by [...] compared to the levels used during the 2014 race, which affected the MP4-30's ride height and vertical suspension travel and produced increased understeer. Despite taking advantage of grid penalties that saw them start twelfth and fourteenth respectively, Alonso and Button went on to finish eleventh and sixteenth. With the team acknowledging that the Singapore Grand Prix had represented their final opportunity to score points on merit, their focus shifted to development of their 2016 car over the final leg of {{the championship}}. In addition to the engine upgrades Honda brought to Russia, the team sought to use the high-speed and low-degradation characteristics of the Sochi Autodrom circuit to test experimental bodywork parts, including the exhaust configuration. In a race of attrition, both Button and Alonso initially finished in the points, with Button in ninth and Alonso taking tenth until Alonso was given a five-second penalty after the race that relegated him to eleventh place.|$|E

40|$|Air {{conditioning}} is {{very common}} in modern buildings. It was originally purposed to maintain thermally comfortable environments for people inside the building. So far, human thermal comfort {{is not only the}} criteria adapted to given the control and operation of a system. Most of the commercial buildings in Sri Lanka are sick buildings and having extremely high energy consumption of 50 % to 65 % of the total power consumption for air conditioning. The main reasons to have less energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems are over selection of the equipments, poor maintenance and improper controlling. Although having over selected equipment such as chillers, pumps and air handling units of particular installation, the energy usage can be optimized by accommodating a proper control system. The objective of this research is a conceptual development for air distribution cycle in order to improve the energy saving of existing variable air volume (VAV) system while maintaining the human comfort at a highest level. This will be only a functional modification of the system (programming concept), any additional sensing elements and or controlling elements will not be required to achieve the results. Any Specialized Building Management System Contractor can use this programming concept in their system with own programming languages or functional blocks. Only the requirement is that the VAV controller shall be connected to air handling unit controller via a communication bus and the few parameters from VAV controllers shall be transmitted to the particular air handling unit (AHU) controller. Generally in VAV air distribution system, thought-out the running period of the AHU, the duct static <b>pressure</b> <b>set</b> point is constant and Variable Speed Drive will be modulated by Direct Digital Controller (DDC) {{in order to maintain the}} duct static <b>pressure</b> at the <b>set</b> point. The research describes about the concept of the duct static <b>pressure</b> <b>set</b> point to varying (resetting) according to the actual demand of the total VAV Units which are connected to the particular VAV AHU. This will be an adaptive control loop for <b>pressure</b> <b>set</b> point. At the end of the research (under the result), the actual site experimental data is given for the power consumption of "Fixed Duct Static <b>Pressure</b> <b>Set</b> Point VAV Control System" Vs "Proposed adaptive control of <b>pressure</b> <b>set</b> point VAV Control System". The conclusion and analysis of the dissertation shows 6 % of the energy saving from the adaptive control system compare to the fixed duct static <b>pressure</b> <b>set</b> point...|$|R

The 27th had a mixed component of Douglas A-20 Havocs and A-36As while the second operational unit, the 86th Fighter Bomber Group (Dive) arrived in March 1943 with the first pilots trained and qualified on the A-36A. On 6 June 1943, both of these A-36A units flew combat missions directed against the island of Pantelleria. The island fell to Allied attack and became the home base for the two A-36A groups during the Allied invasion of Sicily. The A-36A {{proved to be a}} potent weapon; it could be put into a vertical dive at 12,000ft (3,658m) with deployed dive brakes, thus limiting the dive speed to 390mph (628km/h) ("A36A-1 Flight Manual requires deployment before starting a dive"). Pilots soon recognized that extending the dive brakes after [...] "peel-off" [...] led to some unequal extension of the brakes due to varying hydraulic <b>pressure,</b> <b>setting</b> up an invariable slight roll, which impeded aiming.
