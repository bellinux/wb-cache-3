40|$|A drought {{during the}} period 1977 - 1978 {{resulted}} in a roughly fourfold reduction in the volume of Lake Waiau, a small perched body of water near the summit of a volcano in Hawaii, and an over 200 -fold increase in the late-summer chlorophyll a concentration. The normal <b>planktonic</b> <b>flora</b> of the lake was replaced during this time by an almost complete monoculture of the chlorophyte Nannochloris bacillaris. Nutrients required to support this bloom {{appear to have been}} supplied by an influx of interstitial water {{as a result of the}} development of an unusual hydrostatic head between the perched groundwater around the lake and lake surface water. The lake had not fully recovered from this episode 2 yr after termination of the drought...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Presentation date: 1983 - 05 - 02 Epiphytic, planktonic and benthic diatom assemblages were {{investigated}} in Netarts Bay, Oregon. Samples were collected for a one-year period from February 1980 to March 1981. A <b>planktonic</b> <b>flora</b> was observed only {{during periods of}} offshore enrichment when marine neritic species were abundant and were transported into the bay by tidal currents. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that epiphytic and benthic assemblages were distinct, with relatively little overlap in distribution of dominant taxa. The dynamics of the epiphyte assemblage were seasonal in nature, presumably related to the growth dynamics of the host plant Zostera marina) {{as well as to}} seasonal changes in the physical environment. Intertidal exposure gradients exerted little influence on the distribution of dominant epiphyte taxa. In contrast to the epiphytic flora, dominant benthic taxa demonstrated little seasonal variation in relative abundance. The effects of intertidal exposure gradients on benthic diatoms were dependent on interactions with different sediment types. Benthic taxa in silty sediments were virtually unaffected by intertidal gradients while many taxa in sandy sediments had marked intertidal preferences. Most of the variation in the distribution and relative abundances of benthic taxa could be explained by the physical properties of the sediment, especially mean particle diameter, sediment organic content, and the degree of sediment sorting...|$|E

Loon Lake is a cold, monomictic, alkaline, low conductive and likely oligotrophic lake {{with a maximum}} water depth of 11. 70 m and a low diversity of planktonic diatoms. In summer 2003, the lake-water diatom community consisted of three taxa: frustules belonging to the morphologically highly variable Cyclotella ocellata-polymorpharossii-tripartita-complex were most abundant, and both Discostella pseudostelligera and Fragilaria tenera were of minor importance. The morphological variability of the three diatom taxa is documented by light micrographs...|$|R

40|$|Disamenities {{caused by}} {{emissions}} from Ewekoro cement Kilns were monitored at some terrestrial and aquatic receptor locations. High levels of total suspended particulates (TSP) and atmospheric deposition rates (ADR) were recorded within the factory compared to auxiliary locations outside the factory. The TSP and ADR levels which are location dependent {{were significantly higher}} (p< 0. 05) during the dry periods than in the wet season. Irrespective of seasonal variations the key elements in the emissions were Ca 2 + and Fe 2 +. The concentrations of Zn 2 +, Mn 2 + and Pb + which were trace elements were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) in the deposited than in the airborne particulates. An extensive vegetation structure overlap was recorded at the various sites studied. The most abundant flora belongs to the family: Poaceae with nine (9) identified species. Also, prominent at the study sites with four (4) species each was the family: Cyperaceae and Asteraceae. The <b>planktonic</b> <b>flora</b> and fauna of the river systems draining the area were poor with 16 phytoplanktonic and 9 zooplanktonic species. Numerically, the phytoplanktons were dominated by diatoms (Bacillariophyta) with Synedra sp. being the most abundant species. The zooplanktonic fauna dominated by rotifers had Lecane curvicornis as a regular occurrence in all the three catchment rivers. The physico-chemical parameters assayed were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) in the factory effluent discharges than in water samples {{from each of the}} catchment rivers. Seasonal variations inclusive, HCO 3 -, CO 3 2 -, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + constituted the ionic component of water samples analysed irrespective of location. Alaguntan river which receives effluents directly from the factory had significantly higher levels (p< 0. 05) of the assayed ions than the other two rivers draining the cement factory catchment area...|$|E
40|$|The Rauer Islands {{contain more}} than fifty shallow lakes and small ephemeral ponds. Despite their {{proximity}} to the Vestfold fills - {{one of the most}} diverse and intensively studied lake districts of eastern Antarctica -the lakes of the Rauer Islands have remained undescribed. In this study the physical and chemical limnology and biology of ten lakes is presented and their species-environment relationships explored using multivariate statistics. Analyses of chemical and biological data indicate that the Rauer Islands form a distinct limnological province amongst the lakes of the Pry& Bay oases. Salinities range from hypo- to hyper-saline with an ionic order close to that of seawater. Deviance from this order indicates either an earlier origin for some of the most hypersaline lakes when compared with the Vestfold Hills, more rapid evaporation vs precipitation or differences in the sources of ions resulting from isostatic history. With fluctuating salinities, winter water temperatures below -lO°C, seasonal ice and slush formation, desiccation and high levels of solar radiation, the lacustrine environment presents considerable abiotic challenges for biological survival. Results indicate that {{there is little or no}} <b>planktonic</b> <b>flora</b> in the lakes and no zooplankton were encountered. Despite this, analyses of pigments, diatoms and other micro-algae revealed an active and diverse benthic biota characterized by filamentous cyanobacteria with interstitial algae. Thirty-eight diatom taxa, and a selection of Chlorophyta and Xanthophyta were detected amongst the cyanobacteria. Clusters in the diatom data correspond to salinity. Further analyses of the relationships between the biota and their environment revealed some of the strategies employed for survival. In particular, the synthesis of scytonemin was detected. This pigment is known to function as an extracellular UV sunscreen which protects cyanobacterial cells against damage by ultraviolet radiation. These results support the hypothesis that environmental extremes and biogeographical isolation control the biology of these lakes...|$|E
40|$|Sediment {{collected}} from lakes in two mid-continental regions was analyzed {{for evidence of}} Holocene paleoclimatic change. The lakes, situated within interior mountain ranges of British Columbia and Siberia at similar latitudes, are subject to similar insolation forcing. The primary proxy of climatic or environmental change in each set of lakes is the diatom record, including species assemblages and biogenic silica concentrations, a proxy for diatom productivity. The sedimentary diatom records of three shallow lakes in the Altai Mountains were dominated for the entire period of record by small benthic Fragilariaceae taxa. Uncertainties in the ecological affinities of the dominant taxa make direct interpretation of the diatom record difficult. However, the chironomid record at one lake suggests that dramatic shifts in dominance between Staurosira elliptica and Staurosirella pinnata reflect cooling possibly correlative to the Younger Dryas Stade and maximum Holocene warmth prior to 6000 cal year BP. In a second lake, accumulation rates of biogenic silica appear to have tracked summer insolation trends over the last 8000 years. In the Columbia Mountains of western Canada, reconstructions of paleo-lake levels, and, by extension, changes in regional water balance, are based on variability in preservation and composition of the diatom records and are consistent with existing paleoclimate data from British Columbia, which indicate a transition to higher effective moisture between ∼ 7000 and 6000 cal year BP. Broad trends in climate appear related to atmospheric circulation patterns with PNA- and PDO-like modes of variability. Spectral analysis reveals periodicities of 92 to 910 [...] 970 years, {{all of which have}} been reported previously from sites from the Northern Great Plains to Alaska. ^ Morphometric and SEM analysis of several Cyclotella populations with affinities to Cyclotella bodanica v. lemanica is also described. This diatom is a common element of the <b>planktonic</b> <b>flora</b> in deep, alkaline montane lakes in western North America, including those discussed in this dissertation. ...|$|E
40|$|Desmids are {{freshwater}} algae {{often considered}} as indicator of oligotrophic environment for water bodies. There are ample examples of works done by various workers throughout the world. Though desmids are reported from {{many parts of}} India, North East India, located in South of the Eastern Himalaya, is lacking behind {{in the study of}} this particular microflora in spite of its rich biodiversity. Therefore, an attempt has been made to study the <b>planktonic</b> desmid <b>flora</b> of North East India. Samples are collected with the help of planktonic net, wide mouth bottles and natural periphytons. Species are identified with the help of standard literature. In the present investigation, a total no. of 38 taxa of desmids including 8 species of genera Closterium, 10 species of Cosmarium, 5 species of Euastrum, 5 species of Micrasterias, 1 species of Netrium, Tortitaenia and Gonatozygon, 2 species of Pleurotaenium and 5 species of Staurastrum were recorded as phytoplankton during August 2009 to 2010 which are new records from the South of the Eastern Himalayas. Among them Closterium and Cosmarium are found to be more abundant indicating their oligotrophic nature which are need to be conserved...|$|R
40|$|The 100 ka {{rhythm of}} orbital {{eccentricity}} has dominated large-amplitude climatic {{variations in the}} high-latitude North Atlantic during the Brunhes magnetic chron (0 - 0. 735 Ma BP). Earlier, during the Matuyama chron (0. 735 - 2. 47 Ma BP), climatic variations in this region were lower in amplitude and concentrated mainly at the 41 ka rhythm of orbital obliquity. These rhythmic climatic responses to orbital forcing are evident both in stable isotopic (δ 18 O) indicators of ice volume or temperature and in biotic and lithologic indicators of local North Atlantic surfaceocean variability. The synchronous responses of these indicators are consistent with results from atmospheric general circulation models showing that the North American ice sheet directly controls North Atlantic surface-ocean responses via strong cold winds that are generated on the northern ice-sheet flanks and blow out across the ocean, chilling its surface. Before 2. 47 Ma BP, smaller-scale quasiperiodic oscillations of the <b>planktonic</b> fauna and <b>flora</b> occurred, but the cause of these variations {{in the absence of}} significant ice sheets is unclear...|$|R
40|$|To fully {{understand}} the Holocene climatic variability in the sub-polar latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere and its driving mechanisms, like the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds, we undertook a multi-proxy analysis of a lake sediment core from Lago Pato (51 ° 18. 020 ’S, 72 ° 40. 716 ’W; Chile). The bottom sediments of the core are of glaciogenic origin and gave bulk ages of 30 000 - 22 000 cal. yr. B. P. These are overlain by brown, organic rich sediments which are 9500 cal. yr. B. P. old. The hiatus between both stratigraphic units is possibly related to sediment erosion {{as a result of}} the outflow of a large lake after regional deglaciation of the Patagonian Ice Sheet. The pollen record and a diverse benthic diatom community in the Holocene sediments point to dry conditions between ca. 9500 and 6035 cal. yr. B. P. This is coincident with the Early Holocene climate optimum recorded in for example the North Atlantic and Antarctica. From 6035 cal. yr. B. P. until the most recent period a higher biological production compared with the Early Holocene can be inferred from all proxies, probably resulting from wetter and/or warmer conditions. Apart from the diatoms, changes in the proxies are small since the Mid Holocene. The establishment of a <b>planktonic</b> diatom <b>flora</b> between 6035 and 3780 cal. yr. B. P. with the presence of the small diatom Discostella stelligera s. l. as well as the larger species Aulacoseira ambigua, A. granulata s. l. and Cyclostephanos cf. patagonicus possibly points to a period with sufficient mixing during autumn, winter or spring as well as enhanced thermal stratification during summer. Between ca. 3780 and 2080 the diatom community is dominated by Discostella stelligera which suggest a reduced water column mixing and a more stable lake stratification. From ca. 2080 cal. yr. B. P. till present an abrupt shift to and dominance of small chain-forming benthic fragilariod diatoms took place. This period is coincident with the Neoglacial cooling and could be the result of a change in lake-level, longer ice-cover, a turbid/low-nutrient environment, or a more alkaline environment. In the most recent sediments also an increase of Cyclotella cf. meneghiniana could be noticed...|$|R
40|$|A 46 -m core {{from the}} lacsutrine sediments beneath Mexico City was {{analyzed}} {{to establish a}} stratigraphic sequence of diatom assemblages for use in interpreting the climatic and limnologic history of ancient Lake Texcoco. Diatoms were found in nearly every 20 -cm sample interval, and several major zones were established. Planktonic and benthonic-epiphytic assemblages alternate throughout the core, both of fresh- and brackish-water types. The alternations {{reflect the fact that}} the coring site is marginal to the main basin of the la’ke, and limnologic conditions change as water levels rise and fall. A freshwater planktonic assemblage dominated by Stephanodiscus niagarne in decpcr parts of the core indicates that a large, cool, and possibly deep lake existed about 100, 000 years ago, either because of pluvial or because of tectonic factors. This is replaced (depth 35 to 30 m) by a freshwater benthonic-epiphytic assemblage characterized by Denticula elegans and other marsh diatoms. The marshes were probably maintained by springs from the shore when the lake was reduced to saline pools {{in the center of the}} basin. As water levels rose again (core depths 30 to 5 m), brackish water flooded the marshes, and brackish benthonic diatoms (such as Anomoeoneis cost&a, Campylodiscus clypeus, and Nitzschia frustulum) replaced the earlier floras. These were periodically replaced by brackish planktonic diatoms (as Cyclotebla striatn and CycZoteZZu quillensis) when the lake was deeper, but the earlier frcshwatcr <b>planktonic</b> <b>flora</b> never recurred. The same brackish planktonic and benthonic diatoms that prevailed for several tens of thousands of years are found today confined to the brackish pools of Lake Texcoco that are remnants of the former larger lake. The long interval of fluchlating brackish floras probably rcprc-sents Wisconsin time. The last 10, 000 years of the lake’s history is marked by a return of the marsh flora, sllggcsting a climate drier than that of Wisconsin time. A marked climatic change, how-ever, is not necessary to explain this last change in the cliatom flora, and it seams likely that the pluvial climate inferrecl for the southwcstcrn United States had less effect at the latitude of Mexico City (19 ” 30 ’) than farther north...|$|E
40|$|Micropaleontological {{and oxygen}} isotopic studies of ODP Site 653 provide a nearly {{continuous}} and detailed {{record of the}} Pliocene-Pleistocene paleoenvironmental history of the Tyrrhenian Sea. Although the <b>planktonic</b> fauna and <b>flora</b> indicate that relatively warm conditions prevailed in the Mediterranean during the early Pliocene, the oxygen isotopic and paleontologic records show {{that this was not}} a period of "stable " climatic conditions. The first indications of a cooling trend in this region occur at approximately 4. 1 Ma and 3. 8 Ma with the introduction of a warm-temperate planktonic foraminiferal fauna and a major change in the calcareous nannofossil assemblage. The cooling trend is accentuated at approximately 3. 1 Ma. At this time the warm water planktonic foraminiferal fauna is almost totally replaced by a temperate fauna, the cool water Coccolithus pelagicus shows a significant increase in abundance, and the oxygen isotope record shows a sudden cooling. During this part of the Pliocene, the benthic fora-miniferal fauna present in the Tyrrhenian Sea was very similar to the deep water fauna of the adjacent North Atlantic suggesting the existence of deep water exchange between these basins. The development of major Northern Hemisphere glaciation which has been well documented in the open ocean at approximately 2. 4 Ma can easily be recognized in the Site 653 oxygen isotope record and in the sharp reduction in pro-ductivity of the discoasterids. The anti-estuarine circulation that characterizes the modern Mediterranean appears to have been established at this time. Another significant cooling is observed across the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary, with cool water planktonic foraminifera becoming the dominant component of the overall assemblage. The Pleistocene 6180 record contains two modes of variability, a feature typical of open ocean records. The lower Pleistocene is dominated by low amplitude glacial/interglacial cycles, whereas the upper Pleistocene contains high am-plitude fluctuations...|$|R
