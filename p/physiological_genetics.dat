Considerable genetic variation for morphological traits, allozymes, phaseolin protein, and reaction to bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases exist in the germplasm. Our objective was to identify novel genetic variation in a collection from the Iberian Peninsula. Three hundred forty-seven accessions were characterized for seven morphological traits, phaseolin protein, and eight allozymes at the Misión Biológica de Galicia, Pontevedra, Spain, between 1998 and 2005. All 347 accessions were cultivated common bean of which 102 were typical Andean and 52 were Middle American, corresponding to the two major gene pools. Nine groups could be identified among the remaining 193 accessions. Twenty-eight accessions with the Middle American phaseolin formed four groups: 13 large (41 – 55 g 100 seed weight– 1), five very large (56 – 70 g 100 seed weight– 1), two extra-large (> 70 g 100 seed weight– 1), and eight inter–gene pool recombinants. The latter had one or more morphological and allozyme traits of the Andean gene pool.

40|$|An {{important}} question in evolutionary and <b>physiological</b> <b>genetics</b> {{is how the}} control of flux-base phenotypes is distributed across the enzymes in a pathway. This control is often related to enzyme-specific levels of activity that are reported to be in excess of that required for demand. In glycolysis, metabolic control is frequently considered vested in classical regulatory enzymes, each strongly displaced from equilibrium. Yet the contribution of individual steps to control is unclear. To assess enzyme-specific control in the glycolytic pathway, we used P-element excision-derived mutagenesis in Drosophila melanogaster to generate full and partial knockouts of seven metabolic genes and to measure tethered flight performance. For most enzymes, we find that reduction to half of the normal activity has no measurable impact on wing beat frequency. The enzymes catalyzing near-equilibrium reactions, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphoglucomutase, and triosephosphate isomerase fail to show any decline in flight performance even when activity levels are reduced to 17 % or less. At reduced activities, the classic regulatory enzymes, hexokinase and glycogen phosphorylase, show significant drops in flight performance and are nearer to saturation. Our results show that flight performance is canalized or robust to the activity variation found in natural populations. Furthermore, enzymes catalyzing near-equilibrium reactions show strong genetic dominance down to low levels of activity. This implies considerable excess enzyme capacity for these enzymes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCytochrome bd is a {{respiratory}} quinol:O 2 oxidoreductase {{found in}} many prokaryotes, including a number of pathogens. The main bioenergetic function of the enzyme is {{the production of a}} proton motive force by the vectorial charge transfer of protons. The sequences of cytochromes bd are not homologous to those of the other respiratory oxygen reductases, i. e., the heme–copper oxygen reductases or alternative oxidases (AOX). Generally, cytochromes bd are noteworthy for their high affinity for O 2 and resistance to inhibition by cyanide. In E. coli, for example, cytochrome bd (specifically, cytochrome bd-I) is expressed under O 2 -limited conditions. Among the members of the bd-family are the so-called cyanide-insensitive quinol oxidases (CIO) which often have a low content of the eponymous heme d but, instead, have heme b in place of heme d in at least a majority of the enzyme population. However, at this point, no sequence motif has been identified to distinguish cytochrome bd (with a stoichiometric complement of heme d) from an enzyme designated as CIO. Members of the bd-family can be subdivided into those which contain either a long or a short hydrophilic connection between transmembrane helices 6 and 7 in subunit I, designated as the Q-loop. However, {{it is not clear whether}} there is a functional consequence of this difference. This review summarizes current knowledge on the <b>physiological</b> functions, <b>genetics,</b> structural and catalytic properties of cytochromes bd. Included in this review are descriptions of the intermediates of the catalytic cycle, the proposed site for the reduction of O 2, evidence for a proton channel connecting this active site to the bacterial cytoplasm, and the molecular mechanism by which a membrane potential is generated...|$|R

40|$|Biotin-mediated {{carboxylation}} of short-chain {{fatty acid}} coenzyme A esters {{is a key}} step in lipid biosynthesis that is carried out by multienzyme complexes to extend fatty acids by one methylene group. Pathogenic mycobacteria have an unusually high redundancy of carboxyltransferase genes and biotin carboxylase genes, creating multiple combinations of protein/protein complexes of unknown overall composition and functional readout.

Evolution {{has been}} {{integrated}} with embryology during two great pe-riods: {{the latter half}} of the 19 th C as evolutionary morphology/embryology, and the latter third of the 20 th C as evolutionary developmental biology. My mandate was to use the contributions of three embryologists/morphologists: Francis (Frank) Balfour (1851 – 1882), Walter Garstang (1868 – 1949) and Gavin de Beer (1899 – 1972) to discuss the foundations of evolutionary embryology in the UK from 1870 (when ‘‘every aspiring zoologist was an embryologist, and the one topic of professional conversation was evolution,’ ’ Bateson, 1922, p. 56), through the 1920 s (‘‘ontogeny does not recapitulate phylogeny, it creates it,’ ’ Garstang, 1922, p. 81) to the 1970 s (‘‘homology of phenotypes does not imply similarity in genotypes,’ ’ de Beer, 1971, p. 15). Evolutionary embryology was driven by a comparative embryological ap-proach that sought homology of adult structures in germ layers and ancestry in embryos, and sought to differentiate larval adaptations from retained ancestral characters. An initial emphasis on a phylogenetic mechanism (recapitulation) slow-ly gave way to more mechanistic approaches that included heterochrony and the integration of embryology with <b>physiological</b> <b>genetics.</b> Germ layers, homology, lar-val evolution, larval origins of the vertebrates, paedomorphosis and heterochrony underpinned the origins of evolutionary embryology, and so I discuss each of these topics...|$|E

We found that the majority of Arabidopsis flowering genes are represented in pea and in legume sequence databases, although several gene families, including the MADS-box, CONSTANS, and FLOWERING LOCUS T/TERMINAL FLOWER 1 families, appear to have undergone differential expansion, and several important Arabidopsis genes, including FRIGIDA and members of the FLOWERING LOCUS C clade, are conspicuously absent.

40|$|From the {{standpoint}} of <b>physiological</b> <b>genetics</b> the development and functioning of an organism consist essentially of an integrated system of chemical reactions controlled in some manner by genes. It is entirely tenable to suppose that these genes which are themselves {{a part of the}} system, control or regulate specific reactions in the system either by acting directly as enzymes or by determining the specificities of enzymes [1]. Since the components of such a system are likely to be interrelated in complex ways, and since the synthesis of the parts of individual genes are presumably dependent on the functioning of other genes, it would appear that there must exist orders of directness of gene control ranging from simple one-to-one relations to relations of great complexity. In investigating the rôles of genes, the physiological geneticist usually attempts to determine the physiological and biochemical bases of already known hereditary traits. This approach, as made in the study of anthocyanin pigments in plants [2], the fermentation of sugars by yeasts [3] {{and a number of other}} instances [4], has established that many biochemical reactions are in fact controlled in specific ways by specific genes. Furthermore, investigations of this type tend to support the assumption that gene and enzyme specificities are of the same order [5]. There are, however, a number of limitations inherent in this approach. Perhaps the most serious of these is that the investigator must in general confine himself to a study of nonlethal heritable characters. Such characters are likely to involve more or less non-essential so-called "terminal" reactions [5]. The selection of these for genetic study was perhaps responsible for the now rapidly disappearing belief that genes are concerned only with the control of "superficial" characters. A second difficulty, not unrelated to the first, is that the standard approach to the problem implies the use of characters with visible manifestations. Many such characters involve morphological variations, and these are likely to be based on systems of biochemical reactions so complex as to make analysis exceedingly difficult...|$|E

40|$|Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is a cool-season food legume and suffers heavy yield losses {{when exposed}} to heat stress at the {{reproductive}} (flowering and podding) stage. Heat stress is increasingly becoming a severe constraint to chickpea production due to the changing scenario of chickpea cultivation and expected overall increase in global temperatures due to climate change. A temperature of 35 [*]°C {{was found to be}} critical in differentiating heat-tolerant and heat-sensitive genotypes in chickpea under field conditions. Large genetic variations exist in chickpea for reproductive-stage heat tolerance. Many heat-tolerant genotypes have been identified through screening of germplasm/breeding lines under heat stress conditions in the field. A heat-tolerant breeding line ICCV 92944 has been released in two countries (as Yezin 6 in Myanmar and JG 14 in India) and is performing well under late-sown conditions. Heat stress during the reproductive phase adversely affects pollen viability, fertilization, pod set, and seed development, leading to abscission of flowers and pods, and substantial losses in grain yield.

One way to understand and track this trait is to link <b>physiological</b> studies to <b>genetics</b> by using imaging platforms to phenotype large segregating populations. A wheat population developed from parental lines contrasting in their mechanisms of yield maintenance under water deficit was studied in both an imaging platform and in the field. We combined phenotyping methods in a common analysis pipeline to estimate biomass and leaf area from images and then inferred growth and relative growth rate, transpiration, and water-use efficiency, and applied these to genetic analysis. From the 20 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) found for several traits in the platform, some showed strong effects, accounting for between 26 and 43 % of the variation on chromosomes 1 A and 1 B, indicating that the G×E interaction could be reduced in a controlled environment and by using dynamic variables. Co-location of QTLs identified in the platform and in the field showed a possible common genetic basis at some loci. Co-located QTLs were found for average growth rate, leaf expansion rate, transpiration rate, and water-use efficiency from the platform with yield, spike number, grain weight, grain number, and harvest index in the field.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The main objectives of this study were to: 1) develop improved methods for flow cytometric determination of nuclear DNA content in G. hirsutum L., and 2) determine the extent of variation in DNA content among different race stocks of G. hirsutum. Flow cytometric determinations of DNA were performed in 32 races of the tetraploid cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L. About 19 % variation in mean DNA content was found among the races of cotton analyzed. The range of mean DNA content was from 2 C= 5. 08 pg to 2 C= 6. 05 pg. A general ANOVA was performed, and significant interaction race-leaf effect was present. This indicated that leaf to leaf variation in DNA content was present at least in some of the races analyzed. An individual ANOVA was run for each of the races. The leaf effect was limited to a subset of varieties. Linear and quadratic regression analyses were performed for each of the races. The ones that showed linear, and/or quadratic effects from subset, were the small group of races that presented a significant leaf ef f ect. The origin of the leaf-to-leaf variability in DNA content within plants of some cotton races is an interesting phenomenon that will require further investigation. It could be due to any or a combination of environmental, technical, <b>physiological,</b> or <b>genetics</b> factors including activity of retrotransposons. Grouping of races according to Tukey's multiple range test was performed individually for the first, third and fifth leaves. This was necessary when all the races were included in the ANOVA and a significant leaf-race interaction effect was present. High overlapping of groups was present indicating a high homogeneity in DNA content among races for each of the leaves. Furthermore, more variability in DNA content was observed for the first leaf compared to the third and fifth leaf stages. An ANOVA was performed for the group of races that lacked leaf effect, and no leaf-race interaction was observed. A general Tukey's multiple range analyses was performed for the group of races lacking the leaf effect. Four groups were present. The 19 % variation in mean DNA content among these races of cotton is not high compared to other species that have been investigated...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThree early 20 th-century {{attempts}} at unifying separate areas of biology, in particular development, genetics, physiology, and evolution, are compared {{in regard to}} their success and fruitfulness for further research: Jacques Loeb's reductionist project of unifying approaches by physico-chemical explanations; Richard Goldschmidt's anti-reductionist attempts to unify by integration; and Sewall Wright's combination of reductionist research and vision of hierarchical genetic systems. Loeb's program, demanding that all aspects of biology, including evolution, be studied by the methods of the experimental sciences, proved highly successful and indispensible for higher level investigations, even though evolutionary change and properties of biological systems up to now cannot be fully explained on the molecular level alone. Goldschmidt has been appraised as pioneer of <b>physiological</b> and developmental <b>genetics</b> and of a new evolutionary synthesis which transcended neo-Darwinism. However, this study concludes that his anti-reductionist attempts to integrate genetics, development and evolution have {{to be regarded as}} failures or dead ends. His grand speculations were based on the one hand on concepts and experimental systems that were too vague in order to stimulate further research, and on the other on experiments which in their core parts {{turned out not to be}} reproducible. In contrast, Sewall Wright, apart from being one of the architects of the neo-Darwinian synthesis of the 1930 s, opened up new paths of testable quantitative developmental genetic investigations. He placed his research within a framework of logical reasoning, which resulted in the farsighted speculation that examinations of biological systems should be related to the regulation of hierarchical genetic subsystems, possibly providing a mechanism for development and evolution. I argue that his suggestion of basing the study of systems on clearly defined properties of the components has proved superior to Goldschmidt's approach of studying systems as a whole, and that attempts to integrate different fields at a too early stage may prove futile or worse...|$|R
40|$|Variation in {{reproductive}} behavior permits individuals to optimize fitness given their <b>genetics,</b> <b>physiological</b> condition, social status, age and current environmental conditions. For species with alternative reproductive strategies, behavioral differences {{are driven by}} natural and sexual selection and further mediated by the endocrine system. In this study, I explore endocrinological mechanisms associated with alternative reproductive strategies in the ruff (Philomachus pugnax). Ruffs breed on leks, where males use one of three genetically determined alternative reproductive strategies or phenotypes. Resident males rely on male-male aggression, colorful plumage, large body size and intensive display activity to establish courts on a lek and attract females. Satellite males operate outside the dominance hierarchy of the lek, relying on semi-cooperative displays with residents, lighter display plumage coloration and agility to access receptive females. Males using the third male strategy, considered 'sneakers' or 'female mimics', completely forgo typical male breeding plumage, territoriality and obvious display behaviors to obtain clandestine access to females. The differences in level of aggression and display behaviors among phenotypes suggest predictable differences in steroid hormone concentrations, which {{play a critical role}} in breeding behavior in birds. I therefore examined seasonal hormone profiles of male ruffs and applied predictions from the challenge hypothesis, which posits circulating androgen concentration will vary in relation to intensity of male-male competition during the breeding season. Consistent with the challenge hypothesis, androgen levels were higher during periods of lek instability in territorial resident ruffs. In contrast, when housed in large flocks, androstenedione was elevated during the breeding season in satellite ruffs and followed the pattern typically observed for testosterone in polygamous birds. In response to distinctly different seasonal androgen and androstenedione profiles, I further examined the activational role of androstenedione on satellite male breeding behavior. Androstenedione stimulated both resident and satellite typical behaviors consistent with genetic morph, and thus did not specifically activate the satellite phenotype...|$|R

After birth the GIT community develops into a relatively simple community consisting of 1 - 8 major types within three months. Adults show more complex, but remarkably constant patterns. These patterns are hardly affected by changes in diet. Significant differences were observed between different individuals, particularly between genetically unrelated persons. In general, bacterial communities of faecal samples from genetically related adults (i. e. twins, brothers, sisters) show higher similarity of DGGE banding patterns than those from genetically unrelated individuals, although occasionally all persons in one family show highly similar profiles. The DGGE banding patterns of humans are significantly different from those of other mammals, such as pigs, gorillas and cats, indicating that genetic factors of the host affect the composition of the GI-tract flora. The major bacterial groups were identified by cloning and sequencing of the dominant 16 S rDNA molecules. At least three sequences with highest homology to Ruminococcus obeum and Eubacterium halii and Fusobacterium prausnitzii were present in all human subjects and are likely to play a universal role in the GI-tract. Other sequences were found in variable ratios in different individuals...|$|R
40|$|In {{the wake}} of rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, and declining ground water table, {{breeding}} for drought tolerance in food crops has become a top priority throughout the world. Phenotyping a large population of breeding lines for drought tolerance is time-consuming and often unreliable due to multiple possible mechanisms involved. In cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp), a box-screening method {{has been used to}} partition the confounding effects that shoot and root traits have on drought tolerance by restricting root growth and providing a homogeneous soil moisture environment across genotypes. Nonetheless, multiple mechanisms of shoot drought tolerance have been reported which further complicate phenotyping. In winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), canopy temperature depression (CTD) has been proposed as a good indicator of drought tolerance. The recent development of low-cost thermal imaging devices could enable high-throughput phenotyping of canopy temperature. While CTD can be an indicator of overall plant water status, it can be confounded by high stomatal resistance, which is another seemingly contradictory mechanism of drought tolerance. The objectives of this study were to explore the <b>physiological</b> basis and <b>genetics</b> of the two mechanisms of shoot drought tolerance previously reported in cowpea and to develop and evaluate a method of high-throughput phenotyping of drought tolerance in winter wheat using thermal imaging. In cowpea, a legume well known for its tight stomatal control, no differences in gas exchange between drought tolerant and susceptible genotypes were observed. A unifoliate stay-green trait was discovered that segregates as a single recessive gene. However, it did not correlate with trifoliate necrosis or overall drought tolerance. In winter wheat, CTD did not always correlate with yield under rainfed conditions. One drought-tolerant cultivar, in particular, had the hottest canopy temperature, possibly because it was able to conserve moisture by closing its stomata whereas another closely related drought-tolerant cultivar had the coolest canopy temperature. Therefore, it appears that no single method of phenotyping for drought tolerance can be broadly applied across all genotypes of a given species due to possible contrasting mechanisms of drought-tolerance and environmental differences...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background microRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs {{that are}} now {{recognized}} as a major class of gene-regulating molecules widely distributed in metozoans and plants. miRNAs {{have been found to}} play important roles in apoptosis, cancer, development, differentiation, inflammation, longevity, and viral infection. There are a few reports describing miRNAs in the African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, on the basis of similarity to known miRNAs from other species. An. stephensi is the most important malaria vector in Asia and it is becoming a model Anopheline species for <b>physiological</b> and <b>genetics</b> studies. Results We report the cloning and characterization of 27 distinct miRNAs from 17 -day old An. stephensi female mosquitoes. Seventeen of the 27 miRNAs matched previously predicted An. gambiae miRNAs, offering the first experimental verification of miRNAs from mosquito species. Ten of the 27 are miRNAs previously unknown to mosquitoes, four of which did not match any known miRNAs in any organism. Twenty-five of the 27 Anopheles miRNAs had conserved sequences in the genome of a divergent relative, the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti. Two clusters of miRNAs were found within introns of orthologous genes in An. gambiae, Ae. aegypti, and Drosophila melanogaster. Mature miRNAs were detected in An. stephensi for all of the nine selected miRNAs, including the four novel miRNAs (miR-x 1 - miR-x 4), either by northern blot or by Ribonuclease Protection Assay. Expression profile analysis of eight of these miRNAs revealed distinct expression patterns from early embryo to adult stages in An. stephensi. In both An. stephensi and Ae. aegypti, the expression of miR-x 2 was restricted to adult females and predominantly in the ovaries. A significant reduction of miR-x 2 level was observed 72 hrs after a blood meal. Thus miR-x 2 is likely involved in female reproduction and its function may be conserved among divergent mosquitoes. A mosquito homolog of miR- 14, a regulator of longevity and apoptosis in D. melanogaster, represented 25 % of all sequenced miRNA clones from 17 -day old An. stephensi female mosquitoes. An. stephensi miR- 14 displayed a relatively strong signal from late embryonic to adult stages. miR- 14 expression is consistent during the adult lifespan regardless of age, sex, and blood feeding status. Thus miR- 14 is likely important across all mosquito life stages. Conclusion This study provides experimental evidence for 23 conserved and four new microRNAs in An. stephensi mosquitoes. Comparisons between miRNA gene clusters in Anopheles and Aedes mosquitoes, and in D. melanogaster suggest the loss or significant change of two miRNA genes in Ae. aegypti. Expression profile analysis of eight miRNAs, including the four new miRNAs, revealed distinct patterns from early embryo to adult stages in An. stephensi. Further analysis showed that miR-x 2 is likely involved in female reproduction and its function may be conserved among divergent mosquitoes. Consistent expression of miR- 14 suggests that it is likely important across all mosquito life stages from embryos to aged adults. Understanding the functions of mosquito miRNAs will undoubtedly contribute {{to a better understanding of}} mosquito biology including longevity, reproduction, and mosquito-pathogen interactions, which are important to disease transmission. </p...|$|R
40|$|Seed {{quality in}} tomato is {{associated}} with many complex physiological and genetical traits. The performance of seeds is determined by three interlinked and interactive components that constitute a performance triangle of <b>genetics,</b> <b>physiological</b> quality and the environment. So far, {{there has been little}} or no discussion about the genetic analysis of seed and seedling traits in tomato at a systems level. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first systemic analysis of the genetics of seed and seedling traits, adding to a growing body of information on tomato seed quality. With the aim of improving the production of high-quality tomato seeds, a multidisciplinary study (physiology, genetics and genomics) was undertaken to develop and evaluate methods for improving the percentage, rate and uniformity of germination and early seedling development, and for increasing the range of environmental conditions for germination.  Primarily, we explored the natural variation present in a Solanum lycopersicum x Solanum pimpinellifolium RIL population to dissect the molecular-genetic mechanisms controlling seed quality. Although previous solutions to issues associated with seed quality phenotypes seemed promising, none have utilized the integration of genomic, phenotypic and metabolic datasets to understand seed quality in tomato. Thus, the integration of metabolic and genomic analysis contributed to a comprehensive biological understanding of observed phenotypic differences between RILs of S. lycopersicumx S. pimpinellifolium. Here we describe, for the first time, the use of a generalized genetical genomics (GGG) model in tomato seeds that incorporates genetics, as well as environmental effects, and we applied this approach to map traditional quantitative trait loci (Genetic QTLs) and QTLs that are the result of interaction between the genetics and environmental changes (Genetic x Environmental QTLs). This model uses chosen environmental perturbations (different seed developmental stages, i. e. dry and 6 h imbibed seeds) in combination with the analysis of genetic variation present in the RIL population, to study the change of metabolites over the multiple environments and to identify genotype-by-environment interactions. This thesis gives an account of the integration of genotyping, phenotyping and a molecular phenotype using metabolomics in generating a novel understanding of seed phenotypes and their interaction with the environment. In summary, the integration of phenotypic and metabolomics data has facilitated the identification of potential biomarkers for better understanding of the complex nature of tomato seed quality...|$|R
40|$|An {{understanding}} of the genetics of maize kernel growth and development will provide valuable insight into a complicated <b>physiological</b> process. The <b>genetics</b> of kernel growth and development is of interest not only to plant scientists who seek to understand the underlying molecular mechanism but also to plant breeders who seek to develop improved hybrids with faster growing, larger kernels. In order {{to better understand the}} genetics of kernel growth and development, biomass accumulation and moisture content were observed in a sample of hybrids and a set of doubled haploids derived from a cross of elite inbred lines and testcrossed to an elite inbred. Biomass accumulation and moisture content were assayed starting shortly after pollination and continued at regular time intervals until physiological maturity. Samples were taken in 2009 and 2010 which differed significantly for weather patterns, providing an opportunity to compare results from distinct environments. Plots of biomass accumulation vs. growing degree days (GDD), indicated a sigmoid function would likely describe biomass accumulation. Nonlinear functions that produce a sigmoid curve were compared and contrasted to identify a model for description of biomass accumulation. Each of the functions selected for comparison had to meet three requirements. The function has to produce a sigmoid curve, the parameters should have biological meaning in the context of kernel biomass accumulation, and the model should easily converge over a range of growth patterns. Five functions were considered along with methods to account for the heteroscedastic errors. The Gompertz function was selected with the residuals modeled using the power function. A function was sought that described moisture content in the same context as biomass accumulation. After observing moisture content regressed against GDD, the hypothesis was formed that moisture content could be modeled using the first derivative of the Gompertz function. The first derivative is also termed the rate of change function, and {{it was found that the}} rate of change function could be used to model the moisture content. We hypothesize that the moisture content can act as a latent variable for biochemical reaction rate when it is modeled using the rate of change function. Finally, the two models for biomass accumulation and moisture content were applied to a mapping population consisted of testcrossed double haploids. Composite interval mapping and multiple-trait interval mapping were used to determine quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with parameter values estimated from the nonlinear functions. Using these methods, ten QTL associated with biomass accumulation and twenty-eight QTL associated with moisture content were found. QTL associated with biomass or moisture often co-localized to the same region of the genome. A candidate gene search was conducted based on the QTL mapping results. Families of annotated genes responsible for synthesis of glucose and ethylene, defense, ribosomal proteins, and cell division and survival represent the most likely candidates...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach to}} characterize cellular biology is called biochemistry. This developed science {{is used for}} studying <b>physiological</b> aspects, mainly <b>genetics,</b> by characterizing protein and other biomaterials. Since single cells are difficult to study, a collection of cells are used for characterizing cellular physiology and inturn used to describe behavior of single cell (Brehm-Stecher & Johson, 2004). However, {{in addition to this}} advance understanding of cellular genetics, information about mechanical properties of cells is also needed. The molecular structure of the cell-wall is only partially understood, and its mechanical properties are an area of “near-total darkness” (Harold, 2005). Moreover, the approximation of single cell behavior from a group used in conventional approach also requires further justification whether it can be applied to all cell types (Shapiro, 2000). The knowledge of the cell mechanics could be valuable in the future for biomedical applications, for example, variations in cell mechanics of healthy and unhealthy cells can be linked to a specific disease. Available experimental techniques to probe single cells include micropipette aspiration, optical tweezers, magnetic tweezers (Bausch et al., 1999), atomic/molecular force probes (Gueta et al., 2006), nanoindenters, microplate manipulators, optical stretchers (Thoumine et al., 1999) and nanoneedle (Obataya et al., 2005) [...] The functionality of nanoneedles is not limited only to the stiffness measurements {{but it can also be}} used for single cell surgery (Leary et al., 2006) which can be further applied to a novel single cell drug delivery system (Bianco et al., 2005) or as a delivery tool for nanoparticles (Brigger et al., 2002). Conventional drug therapy suffers from the problems of inefficacy or nonspecific effects; hence, nanosystems are being developed for targeted drug delivery (Stylios et al., 2005). In order to successfully deliver materials; e. g. bioactive peptide, proteins, nucleic acids or drugs inside the cell, carriers must be able to penetrate the cell wall or cell membrane without causing death or create any mechanotransduction to the cell (Goodman et al., 2004), i. e. the process of converting physical forces to biochemical signals and integrating them into cellular responses (Huang et al., 2004). Therefore, the knowledge of biomechanics of the cell is crucial in providing prior-estimation of required insertion force to deliver drug material inside the cell. Without having this information, the insertion process may be unsuccessful due to inadequate applied force or the cell may be seriously damaged due to the excessive applied force. This chapter focuses on the following two needs, i. e. the needs for the understanding of the mechanical properties of single cells and the needs for the novel nanotools for the single cells probing. The first need was fed by highlighting our findings on the effects of three factors, i. e. cell sizes, environmental conditions and growth phases, on the strength of the single W 303 yeast cells. The second need was served by showing our findings on the development of nanoneedles which can be used for single cell local stiffness characterizations and single cell surgery...|$|R
40|$|Within {{consortium}} 4 of BIOACID II, {{we examine}} effects of ocean warming and acidification (OWA) on different cod species: Polar cod, Boreogadus saida, and Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua. Species distribution {{as well as}} population structure of both are reported to be already changing, mainly driven by warming of water masses in their natural habitats. Shifts of G. morhua into higher latitudes will increasingly interact/interfere with populations of B. saida in Arctic waters. However, it is unclear, by which dynamics and how fast the intersecting area of both species will alter during the next decades, which could even lead to extinction of the cold-adapted native species. Within this work package stock distribution patterns are monitored by means of population genetic analyses of hundreds of samples collected from the {{beginning in the early}} nineties of the last century until today to assess the current situation and to project future species occurrences. Complementary to these studies is the physiological characterization of each species by means of incubation experiments. These are used to qualify their robustness/vulnerability to future conditions in the northern oceans on multiple levels of organization, i. e. at whole animal down to the molecular level, studying energy budgets and metabolic regulation as well as effects of OWA on different life stages (work packages 4. 1 – 4. 7). At first, specimens of B. saida have been under study to evaluate critical levels of OWA. Animals caught this January in the Barents Sea north of Norway were brought to Bremerhaven and incubated for 3 months under different CO 2 and temperature combinations. During the incubation period, growth data (WP 4. 1) and behavioural patterns (WP 4. 6) were collected. Furthermore, samples were taken to monitor the total energy budget (EB) (WP 4. 1), cellular and mitochondrial energy budget (WP 4. 2) as well as for molecular studies of marker metabolites (WP 4. 6) and transcriptomic analyses (this work package, 4. 3). In parallel, we set up the basis for comparative protein and DNA sequence analyses for both species by constructing normalized cDNA libraries, which were sequenced with Illumina MiSeq (paired end). In total, sequencing output consists of 3. 8 and 2. 5 Gbp for B. saida and G. morhua, respectively. Transcripts were assembled using Trinity providing approx. 16 k protein sequences for each species with an intersecting sequence amount of 14, 843 orthologs. The latter will be analyzed for differences in amino acid usage and codon usage by large-scale comparison. Our working hypothesis is that the different habitat conditions have left adaptational signatures in codon and amino acid usage, which reflect different plasticities for acclimation in both species at the molecular level. Moreover, we would expect the regulation of functional genes in the transcriptomes to be differing, due to different critical thresholds of environmental factors and due to the different evolutionary pressures on metabolic genes. Consensus sequences of both library assemblies are used to build a compact Gadus spec. microarray matching sequence identities of both species to equal amounts. This array will be used to monitor long-term effects of different treatments on the transcriptome of B. saida and will provide an application that will also be used for samples of the planned incubation of specimens of G. morhua in 2014. Together with the collected <b>physiological</b> parameters, population <b>genetics</b> and transcriptomic data will provide an integrated picture of species fitness, critical thresholds of environmental conditions as well as consequences of synergistic effects caused by elevated temperature and high CO 2 concentrations. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{level of}} impact of forest {{disturbance}} on mammal communities {{depends on a}} species’ degree of forest-dependence {{as well as the}} intensity and scale (temporal and spatial) of the disturbance. Where land-use practices such as logging, agriculture, and urbanisation alter the habitat characteristics of a forest, a wide range of effects may lead to a reduction in species diversity or the decline of a population. Arboreal marsupials are the faunal group considered to be most at risk from habitat disturbance in Australian forests. Despite this, there have been relatively few studies examining the influence of forest disturbance on arboreal marsupials, particularly in Tasmania. The overall aim of this thesis is to determine whether habitat disturbance (as a result of harvest and associated activities (and wildlife in one site)) and forest type influence the physiology and population biology of an arboreal marsupial, the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), in Tasmanian forests. A multi-dimensional approach integrating physiological, genetic, and ecological studies was employed to address this aim at both the individual and population levels. In particular, this thesis examines potential impacts of habitat disturbance and forest type on physiological parameters of well-being, reproductive parameters, and population parameters (demographic and genetic) in the brushtail possum. Trapping was conducted in spring/summer and autumn/winter during 2007 – 2008 at six dry Eucalyptus forest sites (three regenerating after harvest and three in relatively undisturbed forest) in southeast Tasmania and four wet Eucalyptus forest sites (two regenerating after harvest and two in relatively undisturbed forest) in northeast Tasmania. Disturbed sites were 4 – 11 years post harvest. All sites were embedded within a matrix of mature or older-aged regenerating forest. Vegetation and structural attributes of the study site and the land immediately surrounding it were assessed. At each site, data were collected on the characteristics of the faunal community (community composition and biodiversity, species abundance, body mass, sex, and breeding success), which included the brushtail possum. Blood samples, tissue biopsies, and late lactation milk samples were collected from brushtail possums to assess <b>physiological</b> well-being, population <b>genetics,</b> and reproductive parameters. Plasma cortisol concentration was assessed via radioimmunoassay as a proxy for adrenal status, white blood cell differential was performed on blood smears as a proxy for generalised immune response, and haematocrit was measured as a proxy for body condition. DNA was extracted from tissue for genetic analyses using microsatellites to explore mating system, genetic diversity, and implications of gene flow between brushtail possum populations. Brushtail possum milk was analysed for lipid, solid, carbohydrate, and protein concentrations. Analysis showed that, in general, habitat structural complexity within sites and age structure of the forest in the surrounding landscape did not vary significantly, indicating that broad resource availability (food and refuge) was equivalent across sites. However, basal area, the number of hollow-bearing trees, and the percentage of mature forest, young forest, and overstorey cover varied with disturbance, while understorey cover and numbers of both tree hollows and hollow-bearing trees varied by forest type. Faunal distribution was dictated by forest type. While most species showed little influence of habitat disturbance, brushtail possums exhibited lower abundance, decreased breeding frequency, and a male-biased adult sex ratio at the disturbed sites. Comparison of physiological parameters across sites suggest that the brushtail possum is physiologically resilient, with no clear influence of habitat disturbance or forest type on adrenal status, generalised immune response, or body condition. There was a subtle difference in fat content of brushtail possum milk, driven primarily by milk composition at one site; this probably reflects site level differences in maternal diet. However, there were no differences in breeding success, distribution of births, and timing of developmental features, survival, or body condition of young across sites. Genetic analysis suggests that there are two populations of brushtail possums influenced by geographic distance, with near-random mating and moderate genetic diversity, across eastern Tasmania. There were no effects of disturbance, as examined in this study, on genetic diversity or mating system. However, disturbance resulted in an altered landscape with decreased female-specific resources (e. g., tree hollows which are necessary for reproduction). Results suggest that the male-biased adult sex ratio observed in brushtail possum populations living in disturbed sites was due to a lower abundance of adult females at these sites, rather than maternal sex allocation, retention of subadult males (e. g., lack of dispersal), or increased immigration of adult males. The outcomes of this study demonstrate the value of using a multi-dimensional approach that integrates physiological, genetic, and ecological investigations of the potential influences of habitat disturbance and forest type on animal species. Such an approach reduces uncertainty about the relationship between disturbance and the response and subsequent recovery of fauna, which is important for the development of effective forest management strategies. Brushtail possums are resilient and able to cope with habitat disturbance at the individual level. However, subtle population-level responses may have implications for population growth and long-term viability of brushtail possums in areas subject to intensive and extensive forest harvesting. These results also illustrate the importance of retaining mature habitat elements in the landscape to allow forest-dependent fauna to recolonise harvested areas and persist into the long term. ...|$|R
