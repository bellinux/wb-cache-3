The U.S. Postal Service issues money orders for a small charge at any location.|$|R

Using items from established measures of service quality, this study compared ratings of banks, medical care, retail clothing <b>stores,</b> <b>postal</b> facilities, and restaurants in Germany and the United States. The German respondents had lower service expectations, and generally lower perceived service outcomes, than did the American subjects. Five dimensions of service — reliability, empathy, responsiveness, assurance, and tangibles — explained 56 % of overall service quality in the German sample and 69 % in the American sample. Other important differences and some similarities between the samples appeared when service factors were examined across settings...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to characterise {{the older}} shopper by {{exploring}} unobserved heterogeneity within the segment and developing an older shopper typology from an empirically derived store image scale. Store attribute theory informed a two-stage research design. Firstly, a ‘pool’ of salient store attributes was identified through in-depth interviews. Scales were then developed and quantitatively tested using data collected through a household <b>postal</b> survey. Seven <b>store</b> image factors emerged, forming {{the basis of}} the typology. Five clusters were subsequently profiled using behavioural and demographic variables: Prudent neutrals, All-Round demanders, Reluctant casuals, Demanding sociables, and Affluent utilitarians. A discussion of the resultant classification's utility in terms of retail strategy, including opportunities for better targeting through adjustment of the retail offer, is presented. This study develops a store image scale that reflects the importance of store choice decisions of older shoppers, extending store image research by providing contemporary insights into the requirements of older shoppers in a changing retail environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{postal address}} {{data and the}} domain {{information}} for address validation contain qualitative, numeric, interval {{and other types of}} data. The efficient processing of such data required for postal automation needs a robust data structure that facilitates their storage and access. A symbolic data structure is proposed to represent the postal address and the information relevant for validating the <b>postal</b> address is <b>stored</b> in a newly devised symbolic knowledge base. The symbolic representation gives a formal structure to the information and hence is more beneficial than other representations such as frames, which do not reflect the structure inherent in the domain knowledge. The process of postal address validation checks the different components of the postal address for consistency before using it for further processing. In the present work a symbolic knowledge base supported address validation system is developed and tested for about 500 addresses. The system efficiency is observed to be 95. 6 % in validating the addresses automatically...|$|R
50|$|Storøy was a farmer's {{son from}} the village of Lund in the {{municipality}} of Kolvereid. After completing primary school, he worked as a cod fisherman and forestry worker before attending vocational school in Trondheim in 1924. He moved to Ofoten to manage a <b>store,</b> <b>postal,</b> and shipping office, and he began writing articles for the newspaper Ofotens Folkeblad. Some years later he became the travel secretary for the Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue, where he mostly worked winters for seven years and worked part-time at newspapers in the summers. Storøy was an editorial secretary for Namdalens Folkeblad in Namsos, the editor of Harstad Tidende from 1945 to 1946, and then the county secretary for the Norwegian Agrarian Association in Trondheim. Later he served as editor of the paper Nordtrønderen og Namdalen in Namsos for a number of years. In the 1950s and 1960s, he created several programs and feature contributions about Nord-Trøndelag and Namdalen for the NRK radio studio in Namsos, often together with Håkon Karlsen and Otto Nielsen from NRK in Trondheim.|$|R
5|$|Lesbians {{depicted}} in literature were relatively {{rare in the}} 1950s. It was the publisher's policy in any novel involving lesbianism that the characters would never receive any satisfaction from the relationship. One or both usually ended up committing suicide, going insane, or leaving the relationship. Marijane Meaker discusses this in the 2004 foreword of Spring Fire: she was told by editor Dick Carroll that because the books were distributed by the U.S. Post Office instead of private companies delivering directly to <b>stores,</b> <b>postal</b> inspectors would send the books back to the publisher if homosexuality was depicted positively. The Postal Service relaxed their censorship after several First Amendment obscenity trials, including Roth v. United States and another regarding Allen Ginsberg's Howl in the mid-1950s, which gave Bannon a modicum of freedom in her plots. Although the ending to Odd Girl Out did not veer {{too far from the}} unsatisfactory resolution formula of Spring Fire, Women's Barracks, and Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness, it examined Laura's internal struggle in the realization that despite her femininity, she was deeply in love with another woman, and at the end she embraced it, which was rare in lesbian fiction.|$|R
