40|$|We revise a {{previous}} {{version of this}} paper [1] proposing a method to transfer emittances from the transverse planes to the longitudinal. It turned out the system showed non-Hamiltonian behaviour because the longitudinal component of the transverse electric field at ends of the transverse resonator {{were not included in the}} model. Including those fields the 6 D emittance is conserved. We review the mechanism behind the emittance conservation. It is still possible to produce an emittance transfer with the RF quadrupole field setting the tunes on synchro-betatron resonance for a short period of time then reducing the transverse RF field to zero. We found some coupling between the transverse and the longitudinal planes is always present, even there in no special device in the accelerator to <b>provoke</b> it. The <b>role</b> of the transverse RF field is to modify the transverse tunes quickly putting the system to synchro-betatron resonance for a short time. The emittance tends to flow from the plane with bigger emittance to the smaller one...|$|R

We employed an imiquimod (IMQ) -induced psoriasis-like mouse model to investigate the effect of astilbin in inflammation. Mice were administered 25 to 50 mg/kg astilbin. Inflammation of psoriasis-like lesions was assessed by histology, circulating levels of T cells were assessed by flow cytometry and cytokines by bead-based immunoassay. Jak/Stat 3 in isolated T cells was assessed by Western blotting and RORγt expression was assessed by RT-PCR. Administration of astilbin ameliorated IMQ-induced keratinocyte proliferation, infiltration of CD 3 + cells to psoriatic lesions and ameliorated elevations in circulating CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells and inflammatory cytokines (IL- 17 A, TNF-α, IL- 6, IFN-γ and IL- 2). In vitro, astilbin inhibited Th 17 cell differentiation and IL- 17 secretion of isolated T cells, and inhibited Jak/Stat 3 signaling in Th 17 cells, while up-regulating Stat 3 inhibitor SCOSE 3 expression in psoriatic lesions. Thus, astilbin likely alleviates psoriasis-like skin lesions by inhibiting Th 17 related inflammation. Astilbin represents as an interesting candidate drug for immunoregulation of psoriasis...|$|R

A biological antioxidant capable of inhibiting oxidative stress mediated diabetic progressions; during hyperglycemia is still the need of the era. The current study was performed to study the effect of biologically synthesized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to control the hyperglycemic conditions in streptozotocin induced diabetic mice. Results The profound control of AuNPs over the anti oxidant enzymes such as GSH, SOD, Catalase and GPx in diabetic mice to normal, by inhibition of lipid peroxidation and ROS generation during hyperglycemia evidence their anti-oxidant effect during hyperglycemia. The AuNPs exhibited an insistent control over the blood glucose level, lipids and serum biochemical profiles in diabetic mice near to the control mice <b>provokes</b> their effective <b>role</b> in controlling and increasing the organ functions for better utilization of blood glucose. Histopathological and hematological studies revealed the non-toxic and protective effect of the gold nanoparticles over the vital organs when administered at dosage of 2. 5 mg/kilogram. body. weight/day. ICP-MS analysis revealed the biodistribution of gold nanoparticles in the vital organs showing accumulation of AuNPs in the spleen comparatively greater than other organs. Conclusion The results obtained disclose the effectual role of AuNPs as an anti-oxidative agent, by inhibiting the formation of ROS, scavenging free radicals; thus increasing the anti-oxidant defense enzymes and creating a sustained control over hyperglycemic conditions which consequently evoke the potential of AuNPs as an economic therapeutic remedy in diabetic treatments and its complications. </p...|$|R
40|$|On the 1 st of January 1993 the {{territory}} {{covered by the}} European Union member states became the Single European Market (SEM). The political and economic implications of this transformation have been analyzed by many political scientists and economists. Sociologists have been much less interested in the matter, probably because {{it looks like an}} exclusively 'technical' one. However, such a 'technical' matter has also had deep social consequences. From its early beginning the professional category of the customs officials, for example, has been influenced very strongly by the European integration process. Nonetheless, the transformation of the customs official's occupational role from a purely national to a supranational one has not been automatic. It has gone through a long process of redefinition, which faced the resistance of the officials and of the institutions they belong to. During the study an international comparison between two very different cases: Italy and Denmark, has been carried out. The objective was to collect the broadest possible pattern of reactions, with the aim of understanding the dynamics that can lead to the redefinition of personal affiliations and allegiances. Through the professional role, in fact, actors define their personal identity. An important change in such a central <b>role,</b> <b>provokes</b> a general readjustment of all their attitudes and behaviors. Moreover, it forces them to redefine the meaning they attribute to different socio-territorial entities such as the nation-state or the European Union.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how the tactical decision making of (mainly) German Police Officers {{was influenced by}} several factors that are salient in training and operational environments. First, the effects of conventional ammunition (CA) versus non-lethal training ammunition (NLTA) in training settings on psychophysiological parameters and working memory were compared. It was found, {{that there is no}} difference in psychophysiological response to a demanding training exercise with regards to different ammunition used. This indicates that there are no differences between CA and NLTA with regards to representativeness of training. Second, a tactical scenario and a physical exercise were compared with regards of the effects on executive functioning. The findings yielded that executive functioning was equally enhanced due to a physical exercise compared to tactical scenario. This leads to the conclusion that cognitive adaptions are probably caused by physical demand. Third, the effects of previous experience in (simulated) violent confrontations on threat-related attentional biases and risk taking were investigated. The results showed, that previous experience as a police officer or a martial artist had no effect on threat-related attentional biases or risk taking. Fourth, the impact of ego depletion on police officers when <b>provoked</b> by a <b>role</b> player in a scenario were quantitatively assessed. The findings revealed that a state of ego depletion shortened the time when police officers displayed offensive aggression towards a provocative role player compared to non-depleted officers. Taken together the current work provided evidence, that: (a) tactical decision making of officers is influenced by physiological load and ego depletion, and (b) the use of CA and NLTA does not influence psychophysiological demand. In line with previous research on human defensive behaviour, the observed cognitive shifts under conditions of threat can be interpreted as an adaptive behaviour in order to cope with the demand at hand. However, the current results indicate that these cognitive shifts may be mediated by physiological arousal. Further research is needed to further clarify this relationship. With regards to threat-related attentional bias, the current work indicates that current paradigms probably are not capable of capturing functional threat- related attentional bias. Furthermore, it could be argued, that current training settings do not provide enough valid cues in order to learn functional threat- related attentional bias. Therefore, future work should employ more valid cues in the context of police use of force to further investigate the development of functional threat-related attentional bias. Concerning ego depletion and self-regulation, the current work for the first time demonstrates that depleted self-control resources transfer to observable physical aggression. Since there is evidence that self-control performance varies across contexts the obtained results are important for both the aggression and the police use of force domain. As such the results are in line with current theories of self-control. From a practical perspective the results shed light on the design of representative learning and testing environment in the police of force domain: The use of NLTA in the police use of force training should be broadened at the expense of CA, allowing for safer and more representative training settings. Furthermore, police training should emphasize enhancing physical fitness and self-control. However, further research aiming at developing self- control in the police use of force context is clearly needed...|$|R
5000|$|Following {{allegations}} against Romani truck drivers {{of sexual harassment}} toward non-Romani Turkish high school girls, a series of violent attacks took place against the Romani community of Bayramiç. The first attack targeted the muhacir sub-group of Romani, who were engaged in the logging truck driving industry. 38 houses were damaged. This attack then grew into a second assault against all Romani persons in the area, involving 3,000 individuals who stoned Romani houses and beat Romani residents. The crowd marched on the municipal building, which was located on the main avenue leading to the [...] "neighbourhoods where the Gypsies lived." [...] When the city's attorney attempted to stop the crowd, {{in what has been}} described by Ӧzateşler as [...] "the best example of civil courage" [...] he was nearly beaten to death by a gang of 30-40 individuals. The Roma were subsequently forced to leave the city. According to Ӧzateşler, The most repeated reason given for the attacks by the Turks was the immoral acts of some Gypsy boys toward Turkish girls. It was claimed the Gypsy [...] had tried to seduce, or at least behave improperly, toward Turkish girls who {{were on their way to}} secondary school. For many Turks, this behavior, which was perceived as an attack on the moral values of the Turkish people, showed the true nature of the Gypsies and they considered it as a legitimate reason to take revenge ... Nationalist feelings were mobilized and exploited during the attacks. Anthems and flags were present during the attacks and the Gypsies were attacked as if they were national enemies. [...] Many Romani went into hiding, while individuals who employed Romani experienced threats. Some employers chose to risk their own safety and social status by protecting Romani people from the violence. Cases have been documented of Romani women claiming to have experienced miscarriages and other birth complications, or fears of such, due to the uncertainty caused by the violence. Verbal threats of sexual assault were directed towards Romani women. Ӧzateşler argues that, conversely, the (non-minority) female body was used to promote nationalist violence:In cases of conflicts and war, the female body is often treated as an arena for masculine honor and prestige along with nationalistic territorial claims ... Gypsies making passes at Turkish girls was seen as a violation of the national border and the territory of Turkish men ... female agency was entirely lacking in this scenario. The actual attackers were men and the supposedly abused women remained anonymous; nobody knew anything about them not even whether they really existed or not.From the perspective of Rana Kocayar, the oldest daughter of the Romani family that had purchased the logging truck, and Bidon Hilmi, a Romani truck driver at the time who was beaten during the violence, the allegations of sexual harassment were a means to cover the primary motives of the attacks, which were an attempt to prevent Romani people from participating in the forestry sector. The violence ended on February 22, 1970 when word spread that one of the key perpetrators, a logging truck driver named Halit Er, was in critical medical condition. His injuries had been caused during an altercation with Romani in Çanakkale, who attacked him due to his <b>role</b> <b>provoking</b> the Bayramiç attacks. Some Romani returned to Bayramiç in the following months and years, while others did not. To date, no one has been prosecuted for inciting or taking part in the violence.|$|R

O estudo teve como objetivo geral compreender o processo de transiÃ§Ã£o do familiar de idosos com doenÃ§a de Parkinson ao exercer o papel de cuidador, com base na teoria de enfermagem das TransiÃ§Ãµes. Realizou-se um estudo qualitativo, do tipo descritivo e exploratÃ³rio com 20 familiares cuidadores de idosos com doenÃ§a de Parkinson cadastrados na AssociaÃ§Ã£o Parkinson Santa Catarina. A coleta de dados ocorreu entre os meses de marÃ§o a agosto de 2015, por meio de entrevista semiestruturada, e a anÃ¡lise dos dados textuais seguiu a anÃ¡lise temÃ¡tica de conteÃºdo, proposta por Bardin, considerando os pressupostos da Teoria das TransiÃ§Ãµes e os objetivos do estudo. As questÃµes Ã©ticas cursaram todo processo de investigaÃ§Ã£o com a intenÃ§Ã£o de resguardar a privacidade e intimidade dos participantes do estudo, com respeito Ã s diretrizes e normas regulamentares de pesquisa envolvendo seres humanos. Os resultados foram sistematizados em trÃªs temas. No primeiro - Processo de transiÃ§Ã£o para o exercÃ­cio do papel de cuidador: a adaptaÃ§Ã£o dos familiares de idosos com doenÃ§a de Parkinson, constatou que a repercussÃ£o da transiÃ§Ã£o para o exercÃ­cio do papel de cuidado compreende a conscientizaÃ§Ã£o dos primeiros sintomas e do diagnÃ³stico da DP e das mudanÃ§as que a doenÃ§a acarreta em seu estilo de vida, bem com que tornar-se cuidar tem um tempo individualizado para ocorrer e que pode ser comprometido pela existÃªncia de possÃ­veis eventos familiares nas fases de entrada e passagem da transiÃ§Ã£o. O segundo tema, intitulado Fatores facilitadores e inibidores condicionantes da transiÃ§Ã£o situacional do familiar cuidador de idosos com doenÃ§a de Parkinson, verificou que para auxiliar os familiares a alcanÃ§arem o bem-estar e a transiÃ§Ã£o saudÃ¡vel no exercÃ­cio 16 do papel de cuidador, os enfermeiros devem direcionar a avaliaÃ§Ã£o aos condicionantes facilitadores presentes no contexto familiar. O tema 3 : Indicadores do processo de transiÃ§Ã£o para o exercÃ­cio de cuidador familiar de idosos com doenÃ§a de Parkinson, constatou que no percurso de saÃ­da da transiÃ§Ã£o, os familiares cuidadores apresentam a integraÃ§Ã£o da rotina de cuidados Ã  vida pessoal, aceitam o estado de saÃºde de seu familiar atravÃ©s da visÃ£o positiva da doenÃ§a, utiliza estratÃ©gias para adquirir habilidades relacionadas ao cuidado do idoso com doenÃ§a de Parkinson, e reconhecem em si a identidade de familiar cuidador. O estudo evidenciou que a teoria das transiÃ§Ãµes fornece subsÃ­dios para nortear o cuidado de enfermagem ao familiar cuidador. A transiÃ§Ã£o saudÃ¡vel dependerÃ¡ de como o familiar precebe e compreende a partir da DP os eventos que acontecem na entrada ao novo papel e como ele responde aos condicionantes existentes durante a mudanÃ§a do exercÃ­cio ao papel de cuidador familiar de idoso com doenÃ§a de Parkinson.

Abstract : Before {{the diagnosis of}} an unexpected chronic disease, identifying {{who will be the}} care provider is a task that may be complex for the family, since it <b>provokes</b> restructuring of <b>roles</b> and duties. Thus, when considering that the transition to the role of family caregiver is a period of instability and uncertainty, this study had the overall objective of understanding the transition process of relatives of elderly people with Parkinson's disease (PD) by exercising the role of caregiver, based on the Transitions' Theory, which belongs to the nursing field. We performed a qualitative study, with descriptive and exploratory nature, involving 20 family caregivers of elderly people with Parkinson's disease enrolled in the Santa Catarina Parkinson Association. Data collection took place between the months of March and August 2015, through semi-structured interview, and the analysis of textual data followed the thematic content analysis proposed by Bardin, taking into account the assumptions of the Transitions' Theory and the study objectives. Ethical issues were present during the whole investigation process, with the purpose of preserving the privacy and intimacy of the study participants, with regard to the regulatory guidelines and standards for research involving human beings. The results were systematically established in three themes. In the first, called Transition process to the exercise of the role of caregiver: the adaptation of relatives of elderly people with Parkinson's disease, we found that the impact of transition to the exercise of the role of caregiver includes awareness of the first symptoms, the diagnosis of PD, the changes that the disease has brought for its lifestyle, as well as that becoming a caregiver has an individualized time to occur and that it may be hampered by the existence of possible family events in the phases of beginning and running of the transition. The second theme, entitled "Facilitating and inhibiting factors that can influence the situational transition of the of relatives of elderly people with Parkinson's disease", found that, in 18 order to help relatives to achieve the welfare and healthy transition in the exercise of the role of caregiver, nurses should conduct the assessment of the influencing facilitators present in the family context. The third theme, with the title of "Indicators of the transition process to the exercise of family caregiver of elderly people with Parkinson's disease", found that, during the way out of transition, family caregivers show the integration between routine of care and personal life, accept the health status of their relative through a positive view of the disease, use strategies for acquiring skills related to the health care of elderly person with Parkinson's disease and recognize in themselves the identity of family caregiver. This study has found that the Transitions' Theory provides subsidies to guide the nursing care for the family caregiver. The healthy transition will depend on {{the way in which the}} relative realizes and understands the events that happen at the onset of the new role, from the PD, and the way in which it reacts to the conditions underlying the change of the exercise to the role of family caregiver of elderly person with Parkinson's disease. The nursing professional has the task of assessing the different steps of the transition in order to contribute to the welfare of the elderly person-family binomial...|$|R
