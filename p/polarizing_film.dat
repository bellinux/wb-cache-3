The front sheet is similar, but lacks the active matrix components, replacing those with the patterned color filters.

40|$|In {{the present}} work the {{recovery}} of indium and of the <b>polarizing</b> <b>film</b> from waste liquid crystal displays was experimentally investigated in the laboratory. First of all, the <b>polarizing</b> <b>film</b> was removed by employing {{a number of different}} techniques, including thermal and chemical treatments. Leaching of indium was then performed with HCl 6 N, which allowed solubilisation of approximately 90 % In (i. e. 260 mg In per kg of glass) at room temperature, without shredding. Indium recovery from the aqueous phase was then investigated through solvent extraction with polyethylene glycol (PEG) -based aqueous biphasic systems. Indium extraction tests through the PEG-ammonium sulphate-water system were conducted as a function of PEG concentration, salt concentration and molecular weight of PEG, using 1, 10 phenanthroline as a ligand. The experimental results demonstrated that indium partitioning between the bottom (salt-rich) and the top (PEG-rich) phase is quite independent on the composition of the system, since 80 - 95 % indium is extracted in the bottom phase and 5 - 20 % in the top phase; it was also found that when PEG concentration is increased, the ratio between the bottom and the upper phase volumes decreases, resulting in an increase of indium concentration in the bottom phase (at [PEG]= 25 % w/w, indium concentration in the bottom phase is ~ 30 % higher than the initial concentration before the extraction) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of techniques for monitoring finger movement {{is becoming increasingly}} important in areas, such as robotics, virtual reality, and rehabilitation. To date, various techniques have been proposed for tracking hand movements, but the majority suffer from poor accuracy and repeatability. Inspired by the articulated structure of finger joints, we propose a novel 3 -D printed optical sensor with a compact hinged configuration for tracking finger flexion. This sensor exploits Malus' law using the attenuation of light transmitted through crossed polarizers. The sensor consists of a single LED, two pieces of linear <b>polarizing</b> <b>film,</b> and a photodetector that detects the changes in polarized light intensity proportional to the angle of finger flexion. This paper presents the characterization of the proposed optical sensor and compares it with a commonly used commercial bend sensor. Results show that the bend sensor exhibits hysteresis error, low sensitivity at small angles, and significant temporal drift. In contrast, the optical sensor is more accurate (± 0. 5 °) in the measuring range from 0 ° to 90 °, and exhibits high repeatability and stability, {{as well as a}} fast dynamic response. Overall, the optical sensor outperforms the commercial bend sensor, and shows excellent potential for monitoring hand movements in real time...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} finger {{kinematics}} has developed into an important research area. Various hand tracking systems are currently available; however, {{they all have}} limited functionality. Generally, the most commonly adopted sensors are limited to measurements with one degree of freedom, i. e., flexion/extension of fingers. More advanced measurements including finger abduction, adduction, and circumduction are {{much more difficult to}} achieve. To overcome these limitations, we propose a two-axis 3 D printed optical sensor with a compact configuration for tracking finger motion. Based on Malus’ law, this sensor detects the angular changes by analyzing the attenuation of light transmitted through <b>polarizing</b> <b>film.</b> The sensor consists of two orthogonal axes each containing two pathways. The two readings from each axis are fused using a weighted average approach, enabling a measurement range up to 180 ∘ and an improvement in sensitivity. The sensor demonstrates high accuracy (± 0. 3 ∘), high repeatability, and low hysteresis error. Attaching the sensor to the index finger’s metacarpophalangeal joint, real-time movements consisting of flexion/extension, abduction/adduction and circumduction have been successfully recorded. The proposed two-axis sensor has demonstrated its capability for measuring finger movements with two degrees of freedom and can be potentially used to monitor other types of body motion...|$|E
