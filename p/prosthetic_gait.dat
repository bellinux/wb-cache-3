On and off timings for stance and swing phase were determined together with the level of co-activity and inter-subject variability. Results and conclusions Gait phase changes in amputees mainly consisted of an increased double support phase preceding the prosthetic stance phase. For the subsequent (pre) swing phase the main differences were found in muscle activity patterns of the prosthetic limb, more muscles were active during this phase and/or with prolonged duration. The overall inter-subject variability was larger in amputees compared to controls...|$|E
40|$|<b>Prosthetic</b> <b>gait</b> {{is often}} {{asymmetric}} in step length, but {{the direction of}} this asymmetry varies inconsistently across amputees. This situation is akin to that seen in stroke patients, where step-length asymmetry {{has been shown to}} be the additive result of asymmetries in trunk progression and asymmetries in forward foot placement relative to the trunk. The present study examined the validity of this notion in three trans-tibial and seven trans-femoral amputees wearing a unilateral prosthesis while walking over a walkway at a comfortable and slower-than-comfortable speed. The latter manipulation was added to examine the expectation that the magnitude of the trunk-progression asymmetry - attributable to a weaker propulsion generating capacity on the prosthetic side - would be smaller when walking slower because of the diminished propulsion demands. Step length, forward foot placement relative to the trunk, and trunk progression of prosthetic and non-prosthetic steps, as well as asymmetries therein, were quantified. The direction of step-length and forward foot placement asymmetries varied inconsistently across (but consistently within) participants. As expected, step-length asymmetry depended on the combination of asymmetries in forward foot placement and trunk progression, with a smaller contribution of trunk-progression asymmetry at slow speed. These results extend our previous finding for hemiplegic patients that an analysis of gait asymmetry in terms of step length alone is flawed to <b>prosthetic</b> <b>gait,</b> implying that knowledge of asymmetries in trunk progression and forward foot placement relative to the trunk is required to help elucidate the contribution of underlying impairments (viz. propulsion generating capacity) and adopted compensations on <b>prosthetic</b> <b>gait</b> asymmetry. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|During {{walking on}} an {{instrumented}} treadmill with an embedded force platform or grid of pressure sensors, center-of-pressure (COP) trajectories exhibit a characteristic butterfly-like shape, reflecting the medio-lateral and anterior–posterior weight shifts associated with alternating steps. We define “gaitography” as {{the analysis of}} such COP trajectories during walking (the “gaitograms”). It is currently unknown, however, if gaitography can be employed to characterize pathological gait, such as lateralized gait impairments. We therefore registered gaitograms for a heterogeneous sample of persons with a trans-femoral and trans-tibial amputation during treadmill walking at a self-selected comfortable speed. We found that gaitograms directly visualize between-person differences in <b>prosthetic</b> <b>gait</b> in terms of step width and the relative duration of prosthetic and non-prosthetic single-support stance phases. We further demonstrated that one should not only focus on the gaitogram’s shape {{but also on the}} time evolution along that shape, given that the COP evolves much slower in the single-support phase than in the double-support phase. Finally, commonly used temporal and spatial <b>prosthetic</b> <b>gait</b> characteristics were derived, revealing both individual and systematic differences in prosthetic and non-prosthetic step lengths, step times, swing times, and double-support durations. Because gaitograms can be rapidly collected in an unobtrusive and markerless manner over multiple gait cycles without constraining foot placement, clinical application of gaitography seems both expedient and appealing. Studies examining the repeatability of gaitograms and evaluating gaitography-based gait characteristics against a gold standard with known validity and reliability are required before gaitography can be clinically applied...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} control balance and {{stability}} are essential to prevent falls during locomotion. Maintenance of stable locomotion is challenging especially when complicated by amputation and prosthesis use. Humans employ several motor strategies to maintain stability during walking on complex terrain: decreasing walking speed, adjusting stride length and stance width, lowering the center of mass, and prolonging the double support time. The mechanisms of selecting these motor strategies by the primary motor cortex are unknown and cannot be studied directly in humans. There is also little information about dynamic stability of <b>prosthetic</b> <b>gait</b> with bone-anchored prostheses, which are thought to provide sensory feedback to the amputee through osseoperception. Therefore, the Specific Aims of my research were to (1) evaluate dynamic stability and {{the activity of the}} primary motor cortex during walking with different constraints on the base of support and (2) develop an animal model to evaluate mechanics and stability of <b>prosthetic</b> <b>gait</b> with a bone-anchored prosthesis. To address these aims, I developed a feline model that allows for investigating (1) the role of the primary motor cortex in regulation of dynamic stability of intact locomotion, (2) skin and bone integration with a percutaneous porous titanium implant facilitating prosthetic attachment, and (3) dynamic stability of walking on a bone-anchored prosthesis. The results of Specific Aim 1 demonstrated that the area and shape of the base of support influence the margins of dynamic stability during quadrupedal walking. For example, I found that the animal is dynamically unstable in the sagittal plane and frontal plane (although to a lesser degree) during a double-support by a forelimb and the contralateral hindlimb. Elevated neuronal activity from the right forelimb representation in the primary motor cortex during these phases suggests that the motor cortex may contribute to selection of paw placement location and thus to regulation of stability. The results of Specific Aim 2 on the development of skin-integrated bone-anchored prostheses demonstrated the following. Skin ingrowth into 3 types of porous titanium pylons (pore sizes 40 - 100 μm and 100 - 160 μm and nano-tubular surface treatment) implanted under skin of rats was seen 3 and 6 weeks after implantation, and skin filled at least 30 % of available implant space. The duration of implantation, but not implant pore size (in the studied range) or surface treatment statistically influenced skin ingrowth; pore size and time of implantation affected the implant extrusion length (p< 0. 05). The implant type with the slowest extrusion rate (pore size 40 - 100 μm) was used in a feline model of <b>prosthetic</b> <b>gait</b> with skin-integrated bone-anchored prosthesis. The developed implantation methods, rehabilitation procedures and feline prostheses allowed 2 animals to utilize skin- and bone-integrated prostheses for dynamically stable locomotion. <b>Prosthetic</b> <b>gait</b> analysis demonstrated that the animals loaded the prosthetic limb, but increased reliance on intact limbs for weight support and propulsion. The obtained results and developed animal model improve the understanding of locomotor stability control and integration of skin with percutaneous implants.

40|$|Background. Step length {{asymmetry}} {{is considered}} exclusive for measuring gait asymmetry. However asymmetries in trunk progression and forward foot placement {{relative to the}} trunk may also contribute to gait asymmetry since {{the sum of the}} two should result in step length asymmetry.

Especially <b>prosthetic</b> <b>gait</b> may magnify this relation since <b>prosthetic</b> <b>gait</b> is often asymmetric. Objective. To investigate the effect of inclination on (i) the relation between step length, trunk progression and forward foot placement asymmetry, and (ii) the adaptation strategies adopted by amputees to cope with altered propulsion demands. Methods. Full-body motion analysis was performed on 8 unilateral trans-tibial amputees when walking on an inclined treadmill at their comfortable speed. (Non-) Prosthetic, step length, trunk progression, forward foot placement and corresponding asymmetries were determined. Results. The asymmetries in both trunk progression plus forward foot placement were highly correlated to step length asymmetry for inclined walking. Adaptations were most prominent in forward foot placement. Inclination was negatively correlated with the average forward foot placement and positively correlated with the absolute differences in forward foot placement between the prosthetic and the non-prosthetic step. Two groups could be distinguished when looking at the direction (negative/positive) of forward foot placement asymmetry. When accounted for these groups, inclination was positively correlated to forward foot placement asymmetry. Conclusion. (i) The relation between asymmetries in step length, trunk progression and forward foot placement was unaffected by inclination. (ii) One adaptation strategy was to decreased non-prosthetic forward foot placement, however more subtle adaptations may also have played a role...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{determined}} if detection of the onset of gait initiation in transfemoral amputees can be useful for voluntary control of upper leg prostheses. From six transfemoral amputees inertial sensor data and EMG were measured at the <b>prosthetic</b> leg during <b>gait</b> initiation. First, initial movement was detected from the inertial sensor data. Subsequently it was determined whether EMG could predict initial movement before detection based on the inertial sensors with comparable consistency as the inertial sensors. From the inertial sensors the initial movement can be determined. If the prosthetic leg leads, the upper leg accelerometer data was able to detect initial movement best. If the intact leg leads the upper leg gyroscope data performed best. Inertial sensors at the upper leg in general showed detections {{at the same time}} or earlier than those at the lower leg. EMG can predict initial movement up to a 138 ms in advance, when the prosthetic leg leads. One subject showed consistent EMG onset up to 248 ms before initial movement in the intact leg leading condition. A new method to detect initial movement from inertial sensors was presented and can be useful for additional prosthetic control. EMG measured at the prosthetic leg can be used for prediction of gait initiation when the prosthetic leg is leading, but for the intact leg leading condition this will not be of additional value...|$|R
40|$|The walking {{mechanism}} of a prosthetic leg user is a tightly coordinated movement of several joints and limb segments. The interaction among the voluntary and mechanical joints and segments requires particular biomechanical insight. This study aims {{to analyze the}} inter-relationship between amputees' voluntary and mechanical coupled leg joints variables using cyclograms. From this analysis, the critical gait parameters in each gait phase were determined and analyzed if they contribute to a better powered prosthetic knee control design. To develop the cyclogram model, 20 healthy able-bodied subjects and 25 prosthesis and orthosis users (10 transtibial amputees, 5 transfemoral amputees, and 10 different pathological profiles of orthosis users) walked at their comfortable speed in a 3 D motion analysis lab setting. The gait parameters (i. e., angle, moment and power for the ankle, knee and hip joints) were coupled to form 36 cyclograms relationship. The model was validated by quantifying the gait disparities of all the pathological walking by analyzing each cyclograms pairs using feed-forward neural network with backpropagation. Subsequently, the cyclogram pairs {{that contributed to the}} highest gait disparity of each gait phase were manipulated by replacing it with normal values and re-analyzed. The manipulated cyclograms relationship that showed highest improvement in terms of gait disparity calculation suggested that they are the most dominant parameters in powered-knee control. In case of transfemoral amputee walking, it was identified using this approach that at each gait sub-phase, the knee variables most responsible for closest to normal walking were: knee power during loading response and mid-stance, knee moment and knee angle during terminal stance phase, knee angle and knee power during pre-swing, knee angle at initial swing, and knee power at terminal swing. No variable was dominant during mid-swing phase implying natural pendulum effect of the lower limb between the initial and terminal swing phases. The outcome of this cyclogram adoption approach proposed an insight into the method of determining the causal effect of manipulating a particular joint's mechanical properties toward the joint behavior in an amputee's gait by determining the curve closeness, C, of the modified cyclogram curve to the normal conventional curve, to enable quantitative judgment of the effect of changing a particular parameter in the <b>prosthetic</b> leg <b>gait...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Dysvascularity is {{the main}} cause of lower limb amputations in Scotland and there is an {{insignificant}} proportion (1. 7 %) of knee disarticulation (KD), despite the benefits of the amputation. Objectives: The outcomes of KD and its associated techniques will be evaluated based on quality of stump, functional outcomes, <b>prosthetic</b> ambulation and <b>gait</b> biomechanics, to determine if a greater rate of KD can be justified among dysvascular patients. Methods: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Science Direct were searched for the relevant literature based on a pre-specified eligibility criteria. Studies were critically appraised and data extraction/synthesis were carried out. Results/ Quality appraisal: SIGN 50 Grade of Recommendation, C. 17 studies reported on the quality of stump. Healing rates are comparible to trans-femoral levels of other studies. However, there are risks of reamputations if the method of amputation level selection is inappropriate. The key is to have ancillary physiologoical tests to supplement clinical judgements during selection. Functional Outcomes: Four studies reported on functional outcomes, which were pooere with more proximal amputations. Trans-femoral patients had poorer maintenance of preoperative independent status than KD patients, however results were only from a 1 -year follow-up periosd. Prosthetic Ambulation: Nine studies reported on prosthetic ambulation. Ambulation rates vary largely across studies, however most patients had limited preoperative mobility and it would be more accurate to indicate the maintenance of ambulatory multi-disciplinary involvement in the research teams. Gait Biomechanics: two studies reported on gait biomechanics and walking capacity decreased with more proximal amputation levels. One study indicated that KD provided greater stabilioty than trans-tibial levels for dysvascular patients, but the evidence was insubstantial. Overview of Surgical Techniques: The anterior flap is unsuitable for dysvascular patients. Theoretically, the posterior flap allow 3 s better vascularisation and padding than sagittal flaps, but there was no direct comparisons between both techniques. The Mazet technique is potentially propitious in the quality of stump and prosthetic ambulation, but more robust study designs are required to justify that the technique is suitable for dysvascular patients. Gritti-Stokes amputations had low re-amputation rates, but controversial ambulation rates, and may be suitable for non-ambulatory patients. Recommendations: The overall strength of evidence of current literature is low and further creditable research is required to determine if a greater proportion of KD’s can be justified among dysvascular patients with comparisons to different amputation levels and the inclusion of results from long-term follow-up periods. Variable have to be fully identified and accounted for in multivariate analyses as rehabilitation outcomes are multifactorial.

Během biomechanického šetření chůze u osob s různým postižením se také zkoumala symetrie zatížení dolních končetin. Určité množství biomechanických studií se zaměřuje na kinematické a dynamické proměnné cyklu chůze u osob s transtibiální amputací (Bateni & Olney, 2002; Thomas et al., 2000; Perry, 2004).

Symetrii chůze u osob s transtibiální amputací, které na počátku rehabilitace nosily dvě různé protetické nohy, zkoumal Marinakis (2004). Úplná symetrie chůze není vždy žádoucí. Lidský systém s velkou strukturální asymetrií v neuromuskulární kosterní soustavě (jedna končetina byla amputována) nemůže optimálně fungovat, když je chůze symetrická (Winter & Sienko, 1988). V tomto případě je lepší nesymetrická chůze s omezením reziduálního systému a mechaniky protézy. U osob, které podstoupily amputaci, může asymetrická chůze být nástrojem, jenž chrání pahýl postižené nohy. Lze říci, že asymetrie chůze je relevantním měřítkem pro zkoumání charakteristiky chůze osob s amputací a stanovení jejich sklonu k budoucí společné bolesti a degeneraci (Nolan et al., 2003). Pro chůzi osob s amputací je velmi důležitý výběr vhodné protézy. Vliv protetické nohy na proměnné chůze ve skupině těchto probandů zkoumal Gitter et al. (1991). Efektivnost chůze je také významně ovlivněna nastavením protézy nebo protetické nohy. Rehabilitaci osoby s amputací lze považovat za úspěšnou pouze tehdy, pokud tato osoba považuje protézu během chůze za estetickou a pohodlnou. Nastavení protézy musí vyhovovat potřebám postiženého (Fridman, Ona, & Isakov, 2003). Když protetická noha není optimálně vyladěna, může se tento fakt projevit v různých cyklech chůze. Během analýzy chůze je protéza úmyslně "neoptimálně" nastavena, aby se vyvolaly skryté následky. Fridman, Ona a Isakov (2003) pozorovali vliv protetické nohy umístěné ve vnější rotaci. Schmalz, Blumentritt a Jarasch (2002) použili sagitální posun nohy vpřed a vzad a nastavení nohy do plantární a dorzální flexe. Blumentritt et al. (1999) se zaměřil na účinky nastavení protézy v sagitální rovině na velikost zatížení kolenního kloubu u stojící osoby s transtibiální amputací. Nastavení protézy u osob s amputací dolní končetiny má pomoci zvýšit pohodlí zdravé nohy a maximalizovat možnosti chůze těchto osob. V rámci biomechanické analýzy chůze je důležité prošetřit nejen vztah mezi nastavením protetické nohy a protetické končetiny, ale také vztah mezi tímto nastavením a aktivitou druhé, zdravé končetiny (Pinzur et al., 1995). V jiných studiích se objevuje důraz na zdravou končetinu (Nolan & Lees, 2000; Hurley et al., 1990), ale v nich není řešena otázka různých nastavení protéz. Tento vztah mezi zdravou a protetickou končetinou může být kvantitativní, měřený dle symetrie nebo asymetrie měřených proměnných. The term "gait" {{refers to}} {{fundamental}} locomotion {{by means of}} which the individual moves him/herself {{from one place to}} another. For people afflicted by some involvement of the lower limbs, this activity is partially or completely reduced. In the course of the biomechanical investigation of gait in subjects with various afflictions, the symmetry of lower limb loading is also the object of research. A certain number of biomechanical studies are focussed on the kinematic and dynamic variables of the gait cycle in subjects with transtibial amputation (Bateni & Olney, 2002; Thomas et al., 2000; Perry, 2004). An interesting problem is the evaluation of gait symmetry between a transtibial amputee and groups of healthy persons (Winter & Sienko, 1988; Dingwell, Davis, & Frazier, 1996). Miff et al. (2005) compared temporal symmetries in a healthy group with the values in a transtibial amputee group during gait initiation and termination. Nolan et al. (2003) took an interest in changes in gait symmetry influenced by gait speed in transtibial and transfemoral amputees in comparison with a healthy group. The interlimb gait symmetry of transtibial amputees wearing two different prosthetic feet in the early rehabilitation stage was investigated by Marinakis (2004). Full symmetry in one's gait is not always desirable. The human system, with its major structural asymmetries in the neuromuscular skeletal system (one limb has been amputated) cannot perform optimally when the gait is symmetrical (Winter & Sienko, 1988). Non symmetrical gait performance, with constraints of its residual system and the mechanics of its prosthesis, is better in this case. For persons who have undergone amputation, asymmetrical gait may be the instrument which protects the stump of the disabled limb. We can say that gait asymmetry would be a relevant measure for investigating the gait characteristics of amputees and establishing their propensity for future joint pain and degeneration (Nolan et al., 2003). For amputee gait, the choice of a suitable prosthesis is very important. The influence of a <b>prosthetic</b> foot on <b>gait</b> variables in a group of these subjects was observed by Gitter et al. (1991). Efficiency of performance of the gait cycle is also markedly influenced by a prosthesis or prosthetic foot alignment. Rehabilitation of an amputee can be considered to be successful only when the amputee finds the prosthesis aesthetic and comfortable during walking. Prosthesis alignment has to correspond {{to the demands of the}} prosthetist (Fridman, Ona, & Isakov, 2003). When the prosthetic foot is not aligned optimally, this fact can show up in different levels of gait cycle performance. During gait analysis, the prosthesis is intentionally "not optimally" aligned in order to elicit the implied implications. Fridman, Ona and Isakov (2003) observed the influence of a prosthetic foot positioned in external rotation. Schmalz, Blumentritt and Jarasch (2002) used sagittal shifting of the foot to both anterior and posterior directions and foot alignment to both plantar a dorsal flexion. Blumentritt et al. (1999) focussed on the effects of sagittal plane prosthetic alignment to the magnitude of knee joint loads on a standing transtibial amputee. The objectives of prosthetic alignment in persons with lower limb amputation are the enhancement of the remaining limb's comfort and to maximize the individual's walking capabilities. In biomechanical gait analysis, it is important to investigate not only the relationship between prosthetic foot alignment and the prosthetic limb, but also the relationship between this alignment and activity of the contralateral, sound limb (Pinzur et al., 1995). An accent on the sound limb appears in other studies (Nolan & Lees, 2000; Hurley et al., 1990), but there the question of various prosthetic alignments is not considered. This relationship between the sound and the prosthetic limb can be quantitative, measured by the symmetry or asymmetry of the measured variables...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{asymmetry}} in {{step length}} in <b>prosthetic</b> <b>gait</b> {{is often seen}} as a detrimental effect of the impairment; however, this asymmetry also might be a functional compensation. An advantage of a smaller step length of the nonprosthetic leg, and specifically foot forward placement (FFP), might be that it will bring the center of mass closer {{to the base of}} support of the leading foot and thus increase the backward margin of stability (BW MoS). Objective. The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize differences in step length, FFP, and the concomitant difference in BW MoS between steps of the prosthetic and nonprosthetic legs (referred to as prosthetic and nonprosthetic steps, respectively) of people after transtibial amputation. Design. This was an observational and cross-sectional study. Methods. Ten people after transtibial amputation walked for 4 minutes on a self-paced treadmill. Step length and FFP were calculated at initial contact. The size of the BW MoS was calculated for the moment of initial contact and at the end of the double-support phase of gait...|$|E
40|$|The aim was {{to review}} the {{literature}} on factors affecting prosthetic rehabilitation of older vascular lower extremity amputees. A search of the literature was carried out using the MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL databases up to September 2010. Only original English language articles were accepted. Relevant studies were reviewed and selected based on prespecified inclusion criteria namely: age more than 65 years; vascular cause for the amputation; amputation level of below knee, through-the-knee or above knee; and discussed factors affecting rehabilitation. Age alone is not an absolute contraindication to prosthetic limb prescription; however, it does influence the potential success of gait retraining. Other factors influencing prosthetic fitting and use include comorbidities, premorbid function, level of amputation, status of the remaining limb and patient motivation. <b>Prosthetic</b> <b>gait</b> retraining is not possible in every older dysvascular amputee; however, almost all amputees will benefit from a rehabilitation program to increase independence in transfers and learn wheelchair skills.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the preliminary experimental validation of a systematic prosthetic control strategy on a custom compliant transfemoral prosthesis {{with the end}} result being energy efficient 3 -dimension (3 D) multi-contact prosthetic walking. In particular, {{with the goal of}} capturing essential components of realistic amputee-prosthesis system, a 3 D asymmetric hybrid system model is presented — this forms the foundation for formal gait design and control construction. Based on this model, a two-step direct collocation optimization method is utilized to design an energy efficient multi-contact <b>prosthetic</b> <b>gait</b> in 3 D. The designed gaits are also subject to various practical constraints such as human-likeness constraints and comfortability constraints. For experimental validation, a 3 D capable powered transfemoral prosthetic device is custom built so as to be amendable to realizing the designed 3 D prosthetic gaits. Differentiating this device from existing powered prosthesis, compliant components are added to the three joints (two pitch joints and one roll joint) for the purpose of energy saving and human-like behaviors. Combining the presented control methodology and the novel hardware design, the end result is experimentally realized 3 D multi-contact prosthetic walking with improved energy efficiency compared to other devices and control methods...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The present paper {{reports on}} program of work {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} effect of real time visual feedback on kinematics of <b>prosthetic</b> <b>gait.</b> Methods: A total of 6 below-knee male amputees {{were included in the}} study. Each individual underwent three trials of self-selected speed treadmill walking, in which real time visual feedback was provided from forward, backward, and lateral views, together with a control trial without any visual feedback. Kinematic reference values were captured via VICON motion analysis system, and one-minute slots of data sets were processed by its Workstation software (Plug in Gait), which were than statistically analyzed running Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Results: Statistical analyses revealed significant differences in stance phase (Z= 0. 923, p= 0. 031) and stride length (Z=- 1. 807, p= 0. 043) between normal and affected sides in front visual feedback mode. Stance phase was generally extended on normal legs, and there appeared to be reductions in hip joint range of motion on affected limbs. Stride time followed relatively comparable patterns in both sides across all trials. Conclusion: The results suggest that providing visualization in the context of amputee gait rehabilitation may provide an effective way to help subjects correct gait patterns and thereby it may improve the outcome of rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|Most modern {{intelligent}} knee prosthesis use dampers {{to modulate}} dynamic behavior and prevent excessive knee flexion, but they dissipate energy {{and do not}} assist in knee extension. Energy efficient variable stiffness control (VSA) can reduce the energy consumption yet effectively modulate the dynamic behavior and use stored energy during flexion to assist in subsequent extension. A principle design of energy efficient VSA in a prosthetic knee is proposed and analyzed for the specific case of rejection of a disturbed stance phase. The concept {{is based on the}} principle that the output stiffness of a spring can be changed without changing the energy stored in the elastic elements of the spring. The usability of this concept to control a prosthetic knee is evaluated using a model. Part of the stance phase of the human leg was modeled by a double pendulum. Specifically the rejection of a common disturbance of transfemoral <b>prosthetic</b> <b>gait,</b> an unlocked knee at heel strike, was evaluated. The ranges of spring stiffnesses were determined such that the angular characteristics of a normal stance phase were preserved, but disturbances could also be rejected. The simulations predicted that energy efficient VSA can be useful for the control of prosthetic knees...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the application of}} outcome measures to determine changes in function caused by standardized functional <b>prosthetic</b> <b>gait</b> training {{and the use of}} four different prosthetic feet in people with unilateral transtibial limb loss. Two self-report measures (Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire-Mobility Scale [PEQ- 13] and Locomotor Capabilities Index [LCI]), and three performance-based measures (Amputee Mobility Predictor with a prosthesis [AMPPRO], 6 -minute walk test [6 MWT] and step activity monitor [SAM]) were used. Ten people with unilateral transtibial limb loss, five with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and five without PVD, completed testing. Subjects were tested at baseline and after receiving training with their existing prosthesis and with the study socket and four prosthetic feet, i. e., SACH (solid ankle cushion heel), SAFE (stationary attachment flexible endoskeletal), Talux, and Proprio feet, over 8 to 10 weeks. Training was administered between testing sessions. No differences were detected by the PEQ- 13, LCI, 6 MWT, or SAM following training and after fitting with test feet. The AMPPRO demonstrated differences following training with the existing prosthesis in the PVD group and between selected feet from baseline testing (p </= 0. 05).

40|$|Reduced {{capacity}} and increased metabolic cost of walking occurs in amputees, despite advances in prosthetic componentry. Joint powers can quantify deficiencies in <b>prosthetic</b> <b>gait,</b> {{but do not}} reveal how energy is exchanged between limb segments. This study aimed to quantify these energy exchanges during amputee walking. Optical motion and forceplate data collected during walking at a self-selected speed for cohorts of 10 controls, 10 unilateral trans-tibial, 10 unilateral trans-femoral and 10 bilateral trans-femoral amputees {{were used to determine}} the energy exchanges between lower limb segments. At push-off, consistent thigh and shank segment powers were observed between amputee groups (1. 12 W/kg vs. 1. 05 W/kg for intact limbs and 0. 97 W/kg vs. 0. 99 W/kg for prosthetic limbs), and reduced prosthetic ankle power, particularly in trans-femoral amputees (3. 12 W/kg vs. 0. 87 W/kg). Proximally-directed energy exchange was observed in the intact limbs of amputees and controls, while prosthetic limbs displayed distally-directed energy exchanges at the knee and hip. This study used energy flow analysis to show a reversal in the direction in which energy is exchanged between prosthetic limb segments at push-off. This reversal was required to provide sufficient energy to propel the limb segments and is likely {{a direct result of the}} lack of push-off power at the prosthetic ankle, particularly in trans-femoral amputees, and leads to their increased metabolic cost of walking...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The <b>prosthetic</b> <b>gait</b> of {{unilateral}} transfemoral amputees. Design: Case series. Setting: Laboratory of Gait Analysis (GIGA-system of K-lab) in the Department of Rehabilitation of {{a university}} hospital. Patients: Eleven men with transfemoral amputation (mean age 35. 7 years) participated. The amputation was performed at least 2 years ago and was caused by trauma or osteosarcoma. Main Outcome Measures: Stride parameters {{as well as the}} patterns of motion of the trunk, hip, and knee joint. Results: The amputees walked with a 29 % lower v(comf) than normal subjects. The amputees compensate the v(rapid) with their stride length rather than with their step rate. The amputees showed an asymmetrical walking pattern; the amputees stood a little longer on their intact leg than on their prosthetic leg. Four amputees showed an extreme lateral bending of the trunk toward the prosthetic side during the stance phase of the prosthetic leg. The rebound of the hip at the amputated side at heel strike was very small or absent. The intact knee was flexed at heel strike and remained in a flexed position during the entire stance phase. Conclusions: The amount of asymmetry of the walking pattern is related to the stump length. The amputees with highly atrophied hip-stabilizing muscles walked with an extreme lateral bending of the trunk toward the prosthetic side. There is no correlation between stride width and lateral bending of the trunk, Amputees with a short and medium stump length showed a fast transition from hip extension to hip flexion.

40|$|Abstract—Improved {{technology}} {{allows for}} more accurate gait analysis to increase awareness of nonoptimized <b>prosthetic</b> <b>gait</b> patterns {{and for the}} manufacture of sophisticated prosthetic components to improve nonoptimized gait patterns. However, prescriptions are often based on intuition rather than rigorous research findings for evidence-based practice. The number of studies {{found in the literature}} that are based on prosthetic research regarding transverse rotation and longitudinal transla-tion is small when compared to topics regarding other types of movements. Some design criteria for prosthetic components described in those studies that permit transverse rotation and longitudinal translation can be found in current designs. How-ever, little research has been conducted to establish their effec-tiveness on the gait parameters and residual limb. This literature review is an investigation into these motions between the socket and the prosthetic foot, with particular reference to gait characteristics and prosthetic design criteria. Key words: artificial limbs, displacement, gait, leg prosthesis, locomotion, movement, pressure, rotation. prosthesis. It concealed the prosthesis and enlarged the contact area with the ground, thus increasing stability because of a change in action of ground reaction forces. The resultant design therefore consisted of a socket and a prosthetic foot, with a post serving as a connection between the socket and the prosthetic foot rather than the socket and the ground. Although materials and suspen-sion systems have changed since then, current designs are still based on this type of composition and some have additional features, including a conversion of the rigid post into an articulated connector. For reasons of simplic-ity and durability, most of these articulations provided motion predominantly in the sagittal plane and were par-ticularly beneficial for high levels of amputation, because of the loss of proximal joints and the subsequent need for longer prostheses. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{physiological}} {{energy requirements}} of <b>prosthetic</b> <b>gait</b> in lower-limb amputees {{have been observed}} to be significantly greater than those for able-bodied subjects. However, existing models of energy flow in walking have not been very successful in explaining {{the reasons for this}} additional energy cost. Existing mechanical models fail to capture all of the components of energy cost involved in human walking. In this thesis, a new model is developed that estimates the physiological cost of walking for an able-bodied individual; the same cost of walking is then computed using a variation of the model that represents a bi-lateral below-knee amputee. The results indicate a higher physiological cost for the amputee model, suggesting that the model more accurately represents the relative metabolic costs of able-bodied and amputee walking gait. The model is based on a two-dimensional multi-body mechanical model that computes the joint torques required for a specified pattern of joint kinematics. In contrast to other models, the mechanical model includes a balance controller component that dynamically maintains the stability of the model during the walking simulation. This allows for analysis of many consecutive steps, and includes in the metabolic cost estimation the energy required to maintain balance. A muscle stress based calculation is used to determine the optimal muscle force distribution required to achieve the joint torques computed by the mechanical model. This calculation is also used as a measure of the metabolic energy cost of the walking simulation. Finally, an optimization algorithm is applied to the joint kinematic patterns to find the optimal walking motion for the model. This approach allows the simulation to find the most energy efficient gait for the model, mimicking the natural human tendency to walk with the most efficient stride length and speed...|$|E
40|$|Compliant {{mechanisms}} offer several design advantages {{which may}} be exploited in prosthetic joint research and development: they are light-weight, have low cost, are easy to manufacture, have high-reliability, and {{have the ability to}} be designed for displacement loads. Designing a mechanism to perform optimally under displacement rather than force loading allows underlying characteristics of the swing phase of gait, such as the maximum heel rise and terminal swing to be developed into a prosthetic knee joint. The objective of this thesis was to develop a mechanical add-on compliant link to an existing prosthetic knee which would perform to optimal standards of <b>prosthetic</b> <b>gait,</b> specifically during the swing phase, and to introduce a feasible method for increasing proprioceptive feedback to the amputee via transferred moments and varying surface tractions on the inner part of a prosthetic socket. A finite elements model was created with ANSYS to design the prosthetic knee compliant add-on and used to select the geometry to meet prosthetic-swing criteria. Data collected from the knee FEA model was used to apply correct loading at the knee in a SolidWorks model of an above-knee prosthesis and residual limb. Another finite element model was creating using COSMOSWorks to determine the induced stresses within a prosthetic socket brought on by the compliant link, and then used to determine stress patterns over 60 degrees of knee flexion (standard swing). The compliant knee add-on performed to the optimal resistance during swing allowing for a moment maxima of 20. 2 Newton-meters (N-m) at a knee flexion of 62 degrees. The moments applied to the prosthetic socket via the compliant link during knee flexion and extension ranged from 5. 2 N-m (0 degrees) in flexion, to 20. 2 N-m (62 degrees) in extension and induced a varying surface tractions on the inner surface of the socket over the duration, thus posing a possible method of providing proprioceptive feedback via surface tractions. Developing a method for determining the level of proprioceptive feedback would allow for less expensive and more efficient methods of bringing greater control of a prosthesis to its user...|$|E
40|$|During <b>prosthetic</b> <b>gait</b> initiation, transfemoral (TF) amputees {{control the}} spatial and {{temporal}} parameters that modulate the propulsive forces, {{the positions of the}} center of pressure (CoP), and the center of mass (CoM). Whether their sound leg or the prosthetic leg is leading, the TF amputees reach the same end velocity. We wondered how the CoM velocity build up is influenced by the differences in propulsive components in the legs and how the trajectory of the CoP differs from the CoP trajectory in able bodied (AB) subjects. Seven TF subjects and eight AB subjects were tested on a force plate and on an 8 m long walkway. On the,force plate, they initiated gait two times with their sound leg and two times with their prosthetic leg. Force measurement data were used to calculate the CoAl velocity curves in horizontal and vertical directions. Gait initiated on the walkway was used to determine the leg preference. We hypothesized that because of the differences in propulsive components, the motions of the CoP and the CoM have to be different, as ankle muscles are used to help generate horizontal ground reaction force components. Also, due to the absence of an active ankle function in the prosthetic leg, the vertical CoM velocity during gait initiation may be different when leading with the prosthetic leg compared to when leading with the sound leg. The data showed that whether the TF subjects initiated a gait with their prosthetic leg or with their sound leg, their horizontal end velocity was equal. The subjects compensated the loss of propulsive force under the prosthesis with the sound leg, both when the prosthetic leg was leading and when the sound leg was leading. In the vertical CoM velocity, a tendency for differences between the two conditions was found. When initiating gait with the sound leg, the downward vertical CoM velocity {{at the end of the}} gait initiation was higher compared to when leading with the,prosthetic leg. Our subjects used a gait initiation strategy that depended mainly on the active ankle function of the sound leg; therefore, they changed the relative durations of the gait initiation anticipatory postural adjustment phase and the step execution phase. Both legs were controlled in one single system of gait propulsion. The shape of the CoP trajectories, the applied forces, and the CoM velocity curves are described in this paper...|$|E
