Involvement in the war cost Zimbabwe an approximate US $1 million a day, contributing to its economic problems. Opinion polls demonstrated that it was unpopular among Zimbabwe's population.

However, liquidity of interbank markets dropped during the 2007 – 2008 financial crisis, and such a lack of liquidity influenced the entire economic system. In this paper, we analyse transaction data from the e-MID market which is the only electronic interbank market in the Euro Area and US, over a period of 11 years (1999 – 2009). We adapt a method developed to detect statistically validated links in a network, in order to reveal <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> in a directed network. <b>Preferential</b> <b>trading</b> between banks is detected by comparing empirically observed trading relationships with a null hypothesis that assumes random trading among banks doing a heterogeneous number of transactions. <b>Preferential</b> <b>trading</b> patterns are revealed at time windows of 3 -maintenance periods. We show that <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> is observed throughout the whole period of analysis and that the number of <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> links does not show any significant trend in time, in spite of a decreasing trend in the number of pairs of banks making transactions. We observe that <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> connections typically involve large trading volumes. During the crisis, we also observe that transactions occurring between banks with a preferential connection occur at larger interest rates than the complement set—an effect that is not observed before the crisis...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{analyze the}} welfare effects of {{regional}} integration {{in a model}} of endogenous protection. They show that introducing <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> leads {{to an increase in}} protection against countries outside the <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> area. Moreover, the important Meade result of <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> breaks down in the presence of endogenous protection. According to the Meade result, if excess demands exhibit net substitutability, the introduction of <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> is welfare-improving. In the presence of endogenous protection, because <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> is accompanied by increased protection against nonpartners, its effect on welfare is ambiguous. The authors also compare free trade areas and customs unions. They provide the first formal treatment of the argument that a customs union is a more effective instrument for diluting the power of interest groups than is a free trade area. Under a customs union, the tariff available to one country becomes available to all countries in the union. This introduces a free-rider problem in lobbying and all lobbying takes place in one country. The lobby chooses a lower (common) external tariff under a customs unions than under a free trade area. This means that welfare in the country where lobbying takes place is higher under a customs union than under a free trade area, although the same may not hold true for the other country. The level of the common external tariff declines as the number of members in the union increases. Therefore, the larger the number of partners in a customs union, the more likely it will improve the welfare of member countries. But, because of the free-rider problem, lobbies are likely to resist the enlargement of the customs union.

40|$|What are {{the choices}} the Asia-Pacific {{community}} will face if it proceeds {{further down the}} path of developing <b>preferential</b> regional <b>trading</b> arrangements? Fragmentation of the region into <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> arrangements on a bilateral or subregional basis promises relatively little economic gain and considerable risk of increased <b>trade</b> conflict. Larger <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> blocs, spanning the whole of East Asia, the Western Pacific, or the APEC membership, offer greater potential economic benefits but also face formidable political obstacles. In this study, Scollay and Gilbert weigh the economic consequences of {{the increased use of}} <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> arrangements in the Asia-Pacific region, whether these develop on the basis of trans-Pacific cooperation or solely within the East Asian or Western Pacific sub-regions. They evaluate the economic effects of both the existing proposals for new bilateral and multilateral agreements and of more far-reaching developments involving the creation of a substantial trading bloc or blocs in the region. Comparisons between the economic effects of establishing such bloc(s) in the region and the effects of achieving APEC's Bogor goals on the basis of "open regionalism" suggest that the latter approach continues to offer a worthwhile alternative. The study demonstrates that the benefits of global free trade dominate those available from establishment of any combination of major blocs or from APEC's "open regionalism". ...|$|R

However, Australia, New Zealand, and Newfoundland were hostile towards this development, and the statute was not adopted in New Zealand until 1947.
