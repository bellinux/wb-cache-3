50|$|After ageing, the lees must be {{consolidated}} for removal. The bottles {{undergo a}} process known as riddling (remuage in French). In this stage, the bottles are placed on special racks called <b>pupitres</b> that hold them at a 45° angle, with the crown cap pointed down. Once a day (every two days for Champagne), the bottles are given a slight shake and turn, alternatively on right then left, and dropped back into the <b>pupitres,</b> with the angle gradually increased. The drop back into the rack causes a slight tap, pushing sediments toward the neck of the bottle. In 10 to 14 days (8 to 10 weeks for Champagne), the position of the bottle is straight down, with the lees settled in the neck. (This time can be shortened by moving the bottle more than once a day, and by using modern, less sticky strains of yeast.)Manual riddling is still done for Prestige Cuvées in Champagne, but has otherwise been largely abandoned because of the high labour costs. Mechanised riddling equipment (a gyropalette) is used instead.|$|R
50|$|Marsovin is {{the only}} wine maker in Malta that {{produces}} 'champagne'. The Cassar de Malte is vinified using the same procedures of the methode traditionnelle used to create champagne but nevertheless cannot be labelled as Champagne because the terms ‘champagne’ and 'methode champegnoise' are restricted to those wines produced by the methode traditionelle {{in the confines of}} the Champagne region in France. This Marsovin wine takes its name from the wine-making family, in keeping with tradition. It is made from Chardonnay grapes harvested from the family’s private 15-tumolo estate in Wardija, where there are 7,500 vines. No more than 8,000 bottles are produced from each harvest, and the process takes more than two years, including two fermentations and 15 months in which the bottles are left to lie on lees, allowing the conversion of yeast into sediment. The bottles are placed on special racks called <b>pupitres</b> where they are turned by hand every day for four weeks in a process called riddling or remuage in French, so that the sediment collects in the neck, from where it is finally removed to allow the addition of the liqueur d’espedition, which determines its classification as Brut.|$|R

50|$|The Heugel {{catalogue}} {{includes all}} musical genres, both French and international, in particular opera and operetta (Jules Massenet, Ambroise Thomas, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Édouard Lalo, Léo Delibes, Jacques Offenbach, etc.). Since 1920 Heugel has published much modern music, {{including that of}} Reynaldo Hahn, Joseph Canteloube, Francis Poulenc, Darius Milhaud, André Jolivet, and, closer to us, Pierre Boulez, Henri Dutilleux, Betsy Jolas, Gilbert Amy. Le <b>Pupitre,</b> a collection of early music, was started in 1967 under the general editorship of François Lesure; its critical editions are highly respected by musicologists all over the world.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the premiere}} of Pierre Schaeffer's Symphonie pour un homme seul in 1951, a system that was {{designed}} for the spatial control of sound was tested. It was called a [...] "relief desk" [...] (<b>pupitre</b> de relief, but {{also referred to as}} <b>pupitre</b> d'espace or potentiomètre d'espace) and was intended to control the dynamic level of music played from several shellac players. This created a stereophonic effect by controlling the positioning of a monophonic sound source [...] One of five tracks, provided by a purpose-built tape machine, was controlled by the performer and the other four tracks each supplied a single loudspeaker. This provided a mixture of live and preset sound positions [...] The placement of loudspeakers in the performance space included two loudspeakers at the front right and left of the audience, one placed at the rear, and in the centre of the space a loudspeaker was placed in a high position above the audience. The sounds could therefore be moved around the audience, rather than just across the front stage. On stage, the control system allowed a performer to position a sound either to the left or right, above or behind the audience, simply by moving a small, hand held transmitter coil towards or away from four somewhat larger receiver coils arranged around the performer in a manner reflecting the loudspeaker positions [...] A contemporary eyewitness described the potentiomètre d'espace in normal use: ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1921 both {{returned}} to Mexico, {{where they went}} separate ways. Whether they were ever divorced is unknown. Carmen Mondragón turned towards the artists' scene of Mexico City, got contacts with José Vasconcelos and Xavier Villaurrutia, and {{was interested in the}} Teatro Ulises movement. She had multiple sexual affairs. Her beauty is described as mesmerizing and erotic, and she was apparently the first woman in Catholic Mexico who wore a miniskirt. She became model of several notable painters and photographers, among others posing for some of Diego Rivera's murals, for Tina Modotti, Antonio Garduño, Roberto Montenegro, Matías Santoyo, Edward Weston and in 1928 for Ignácio Rosas at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes. Especially her nudes became famous. When a former French teacher of her recognized her pictures, he published A dix ans sur mon <b>pupitre</b> (From my desk, at 10 years old), a book of 1924, which describes the 10-year-old pupil Carmen Mondragón within his teacher's sight. Carmen Mondragón had an intense love relationship with Gerald Murillo, also known as Dr Atl, who named her [...] "Nahui Olin", a symbol of Aztec renewal meaning [...] "four movement", the symbol of earthquakes. They lived together in the former La Merced Cloister. At this time she wrote her poems Óptica cerebral, poemas dinámicos (1922) and Calinement je suis dedans (1923), finished several naïve paintings, and composed. As intensely as the love relationship began, it ended equally quickly in the mid-1920s. Later she denied it completely. After having several further affairs, she stepped out of public life in the 1940s.|$|E
5000|$|The {{horse was}} not tall, ranging from 1.43 to 1.47 m {{according}} to Eugène Gayot, less than 1.47 m according to Alexandre Bernard Vallon,. and from 1.44 to 1.48 m {{according to the}} Cardini dictionary. It increased from 1.48 to 1.50 m in the late 19th century according to the Revue d'Auvergne. The head is fine, short, and expressive with hollows above the eyes, keen eyes, ears very straight and very mobile, and with wide nostrils. It seems stronger than the Limousin horse because it is smaller. The neckline is arched or reversed but rather short. The mane is abundant and fine. Eugene Gayot said that when the wind blows the mane and forelock of the horses, {{it gives them a}} disheveled and very strange look. The withers are high and good-looking, sharp-edged and often separated from the neck by a sharp line. The chest and body are narrow but the chest is deep, a condition for speed. The back and loins conform well, but the back can be long. The flanks are turned up or cordés. The hips are protruding and the haunch is sharp, short, angular and low - [...] slightly avalée or en <b>pupitre.</b> The leg is fine and muscular with a wide and well articulated knee, smooth cannons and well detached tendons - almost as big as the bone. Members are spotless, dry and nervous, and free of defects but sometimes they have defects of plumb. The hock is hooked and closed but big enough, the pastern is short. The foot is small and well formed terminated by a very hard black hoof.|$|E

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the Information Retrieval System DIALECT 2, we propose a connectionist method for a linguistic morpho-syntactic parsing of French Language. The system is based upon a three layers Neural Network with a recursive sentence structure. This network {{is in charge of the}} acquisition of Natural Language grammatical competence, in order to do the parsing of the sentences. The learning stage is supervised and distributed into several levels. The learning algorithm uses a measure grounded on an Entropic computation. In this report, we describe the overall architecture of the system. Then we show the first results obtained with samples made up with sentences from schoolbooks for children who are taught reading.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{emerging}} {{situation in which}} the development of software are involved both free and private components. With regard to the present empirical case, it is noteworthy that many problems of industrialization and exploitation are based on the hybridization of technology. The purpose of the paper is to understand how a partnership contract is an “object of mediation” in collaboration. The concept of “objects of mediation” shows that a same artifact plays many roles in a sociotechnical network. According to the Actor Network Theory framework, this analysis is based on the empirical case: the <b>Pupitre</b> Virtuel. In fact, over twenty months' participant observations and interviews have been done to identify the main elements of the controversies between different actors. The results show that the specificity of technology carries many controversies around the development of software and contribute to explain the failure of this collaboration. Between controversies and compromises, the partnership contract has different natures and plays different roles of mediato...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePurpose - The {{purpose of}} the article is to analyze the {{different}} roles and natures of objects in organizational process. Furthermore, {{the concept of the}} mediation object is developed to understand how the objects help to structure interactions and collective activities over time. Design/methodology/approach - The article employs data from a case study (the <b>Pupitre</b> Virtuel) in order to highlight and illustrate the relevance of a process analysis of the roles and natures of objects. Findings - We demonstrate that the roles and natures of objects evolve over time through controversies and compromises. On the one hand, the evolution of interactions drives the evolution of the roles and natures of objects. On the other, the evolution of objects help the actors to structure their interactions and activities. Originality/value - We argue that, rather than a static analysis, human-object interaction needs to be understood and observed through a process analysis, taking into account the evolution of objects and interactions. This article shows that mediation objects can play three roles - as carriers of controversies, of compromises, and of prescriptions - and that it can appear in one of three aspects - interpretable, modifiable, and non-interpretable/non-modifiable...|$|E
40|$|Information Systems (IS) {{projects}} have been increasingly interested in stakeholder management. In this paper, we are specifically interested in the stakeholder analysis and engagement in IS projects. Thus, we propose to move from a stakeholder relational perspective, anchored in recent studies on Social Network Theory, to a stakeholder relational and becoming ontology, anchored in Actor Network Theory (ANT). Based on this theory, we developed a conceptual and practical method to conduct stakeholder analysis and assess their engagement during the on-going project. We apply our conceptual and practical method on a longitudinal case study of an IS project called "The <b>Pupitre</b> Virtuel". Our contributions are twofold. First, we improve stakeholders' analysis and engagement in a project by shedding light on the dynamic and emergent nature of relationships, since we demonstrate that the nature, roles and relations among stakeholders co-evolve with the definition and trajectory of the project. Consequently, the project emerged also because of connections between heterogeneous stakeholders. Second, {{we are able to}} give managers a useful method by informing the project managers about where, when, and how to observe stakeholders' network of an IS project...|$|E
40|$|Paper 171. AIS Electronic Library (AISeL) [URL] audienceThe {{increasing}} {{failure of}} IT projects {{has led to}} debate about the way these projects are currently managed and to a search for new concepts and theories about project management in order to decrease the failure rate. We assume {{that it is important}} to know how to observe an on-going IT project in order to better understand the issues at stake. For this reason, without rejecting previous studies, our purpose is to present a method that may improve our understanding of IT project failure. We do this by demonstrating the value of observing the IT project as a project network. We show that IT project success or failure can be understood during the on-going project as lying along a continuum between convergence and divergence. We present the four characteristics that describe the trajectory of convergence or divergence. Our analyse is based on a longitudinal case study, The <b>Pupitre</b> Virtuel project, an IT project in the French educational area national. The dynamic observation of interactions of project network entities along a continuum convergent/divergent stresses the difficulty to isolate one or few failure factors. Conversely, our observation allows understanding the evolution of the project by considering the dynamic of interactions over time and the on-going redefinitions of its entities through controversies. From this perspective, it would be possible to correct the project trajectory in real time in order to avoid its collaps...|$|E
