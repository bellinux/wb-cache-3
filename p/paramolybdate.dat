5000|$|Ammonium heptamolybdate is the {{inorganic}} compound whose chemical formula is (NH4)6Mo7O24, normally encountered as the tetrahydrate. It is a colorless solid, {{often referred to}} as ammonium <b>paramolybdate</b> or simply as ammonium molybdate, although [...] "ammonium molybdate" [...] can also refer to ammonium orthomolybdate, (NH4)2MoO4, and several other compounds. Potassium heptamolybdate, also obtained as the tetrahydrate, is very similar to the ammonium salt.|$|E
50|$|In {{more recent}} {{literature}} (post World War II period), the anion in (NH4)10(W12O41)·5H2O {{has been shown}} to be H2W12O4210−, containing two hydrogen atoms, keeping two hydrogen atoms inside the cage. The tungsten-oxygen cage, that is the heart of the anion requires 42 oxygen molecules. The correct formula notation for ammonium paratungstate is therefore (NH4)10H2W12O42·4H2O. The H2W12O4210− ion is known as the paratungstate B ion, as opposed to the paratungstate A ion, that has the formula W7O246−, similar to the <b>paramolybdate</b> ion. The existence of the paratungstate A ion, could not be confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, however.|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of solute clustering in aqueous solutions of ammonium <b>paramolybdate</b> {{has been characterized}} using the following experimental techniques: laser Raman spectroscopy, concentration gradient studies, and multi-angle light scattering. Additionally, light scattering techniques {{have been developed to}} investigate the occurrence of solute clustering in concentrated and supersaturated solutions;The results of these experimental techniques indicate that solute clustering occurs in undersaturated, saturated, and supersaturated solutions of ammonium <b>paramolybdate.</b> The age of the solutions does not affect the degree of clustering in these solutions. The size of solute clusters increases with supersaturation and the degree of clustering increases at the saturation temperature. The clusters are not expected to have a crystalline structure. Clusters of size 12 nm (from concentration gradient experiments) and 142 nm (from light scattering experiments) were estimated in molybdate solutions. However, until the amount of solute existing as clusters can be clearly defined, a definitive measurement of cluster-size cannot be achieved;A model explaining the state of the solute in concentrated and supersaturated solutions is proposed. This model considers the {{phenomenon of}} nucleation from solution as a two-step process. In the first step, large solute clusters in solution would nucleate in their interior. This would be followed by the rapid crystallization of the whole cluster because of its high supersaturation relative to the molten state (the second step);Light scattering techniques have been successfully developed to investigate the phenomenon of solute clustering in concentrated and supersaturated solutions. A unique light scattering work station was designed and acquired and special light scattering sample cells constructed. Experimental techniques have also been developed to conduct in situ light scattering experiments with vertical columns of concentrated and supersaturated solutions...|$|E
40|$|The {{carbon content}} of mesostructured organic-inorganic hybrid {{material}} of a cylindrical block copolymer template of poly(2 -vinylpyridine) -block-poly(allyl methacrylate) (P 2 VP-b-PAMA) and ammonium <b>paramolybdate</b> (APM) {{could be reduced}} by thermal depolymerization. By calcination in vacuo at 320 °C the PAMA core can be completely removed while the remaining P 2 VP brush preserves the mesostructure. The P 2 VP-APM composite can then be carburized in-situ to MoO x C y in a second pyrolysis step without any additional carbon source but P 2 VP. The molybdenum oxycarbide nanotubes obtained, form hierarchically porous non-woven structures, which were tested as catalyst in the decomposition of NH 3. They proved to be catalytically active at temperatures above 450 °C. The activation energy was estimated from an Arrhenius Plot to be 127 kJ·mol – 1...|$|E
30|$|A molybdenum-vanadium-niobium {{mixed oxide}} {{catalyst}} {{with the following}} molar ratio Mo:V:Nb[*]=[*] 19 : 5 : 1 was prepared as follows: 10  mmol of niobium pentachloride (Aldrich 99 %) were dissolved in water (50  mL), and ammonium hydroxide (Aldrich) was added until neutral pH was reached. The white precipitate (niobium hydroxide) was then filtered, washed with water and dissolved in a hot solution of oxalic acid dihydrate (50  mmol; Aldrich 99 %). Then, an aqueous solution of ammonium metavanadate (50  mmol; Aldrich 99 %) was added at 90 °C followed by an aqueous solution of ammonium <b>paramolybdate</b> (27.14  mmol; Aldrich 99 %). The obtained green slurry was heated under stirring until the water was evaporated.

40|$|Colour {{degradation}} and heteroatom removal were studied in hydrocracking of Lloydminster atmospheric residue using conventional CoMo/Al 2 O 3 catalysts containing a Ni-sodalite component. Nickel ion exchange and impregnation {{were performed on}} basic sodalite prepared in laboratory which was combined to an aqueous mixture of α-alumina monohydrate, ammonium <b>paramolybdate</b> and cobalt nitrate to form the final catalysts. Each catalyst was evaluated in a high pressure continuous flow reaction system in which hydrogen and Lloydminster atmospheric bottoms were mixed and flowed upward through a fixed bed catalytic reactor. The reaction conditions were 17. 3 MPa, 415 ∘C, and 0. 59 h- 1 or 1. 07 h- 1 LSV. Ni-SOD was found to increase {{the rate at which}} the maximum colour of the diesel fraction was developed. Sulphur content of the diesel fraction was related to colour formation and a mathematical expression was developed to express colour degradation. Total nitrogen content was found to have no direct effect on colour formation.

40|$|The precise {{nature of}} the polyanions formed {{by the action of}} {{hydrochloric}} acid on sodium molybdate solutions has been studied by pH and conductometric measurements involving glass electrode and conductometric titrations. The inflections and breaks in the titration curves indicate the formation of para-Mo 7 O 24 (6 -) and octa-Mo 8 O 26 (4 -) polymolybdate anions around pH 5. 5 and 4. 1, corresponding to the molar; ratio 8 H: 7 Mo and 3 H: 2 Mo, respectively. Similar pH and conductometric titrations between Hg 2 + and MoO 4 (2 -), Mo 7 O 24 (6 -), and Mo 8 O 26 (4 -) provide definite evidence for the formation of normal molybdate HgO.

In this paper, the {{corrosion}} {{behavior was}} researched which was {{happen on the}} 304, 321, 316 Lect. stainless steel materials in the analogue situation of calcining gas atmosphere of ammonium <b>paramolybdate.</b> The oxidized etch which happened on the sample’s surface, phase constituent and element content of the fracture surface, was analyzed by the means of SEM, XRD. The {{results showed that the}} phases of Fe 2 (MoO 4) 3,MoO 3,MoO 2. 5 (OH) 0. 5,Cr 2 O 3,Cr 2 Ti 5 O 13, Fe 2 O 3,Fe 3 O 4 ect. are contained on the surfaces of the 304, 316 L, 321 samples which are calcined. There is an inside oxidized corrosion layer in 304 316 L. The oxidizing film is damaged and the oxygen penetrates into the base to form an oxidized layer. A thin and compact oxidation film was formed between 321 corrosion layer and the alloy interface, which have prevented the base from further corrosion, under this experiment conditions, this steel belonged to the inoxidizability materials. The coating deficiency of 321 steel is shallow; the particles of oxidate is thin and without inner corrosion; the weight gain rate of oxidized etch is slow (average rate 5. 2 × 10 - 2 mg / (cm 2 ·h)), the weight gain is less and corrosion resistance is fine...|$|E
