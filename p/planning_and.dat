5|$|City <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> urban lifestyles {{had been}} {{influenced}} by the Greeks from an early period, and in the eastern Empire, Roman rule accelerated and shaped the local development of cities that already had a strong Hellenistic character. Cities such as Athens, Aphrodisias, Ephesus and Gerasa altered some aspects of city <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> architecture to conform to imperial ideals, while also expressing their individual identity and regional preeminence. In the areas of the western Empire inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, Rome encouraged the development of urban centres with stone temples, forums, monumental fountains, and amphitheatres, often on or near the sites of the preexisting walled settlements known as oppida. Urbanization in Roman Africa expanded on Greek and Punic cities along the coast.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} representing <b>and</b> manipulating <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> other synthesised artifacts {{in the form of}} a set of constraints. The (Issues- Nodes- Orderings/Variables/Auxiliary) constraints model is used to characterise <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> processes. The more general (Issues- Nodes- Critical/Auxiliary) constraints model can be used for wider applications in design, configuration and other tasks which can be characterised as the synthesis and maintenance of an artifact or product. The and constraint models are intended to support a number of different uses: for automatic manipulation of <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> other synthesised artifacts and to act as an ontology to underpin such use; as a common basis for human communication about <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> other synthesised artifacts; as a target for principled and reliable acquisition of <b>plans,</b> models <b>and</b> product information; to support formal reasoning about <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> other synthesised artifacts...|$|R
