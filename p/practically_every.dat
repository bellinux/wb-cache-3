5|$|Furious was {{assigned}} to the Atlantic Fleet after commissioning in 1925, although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for <b>practically</b> <b>every</b> aircraft in the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) inventory. These included landing and flying-off tests of Fairey IIID and Fairey Flycatcher floatplanes, with and without wheels, to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats. The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum of difficulty. A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was also tested and behaved perfectly satisfactorily. The arresting gear was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards. Deck-edge palisades (windbreaks) were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing over the side in rough weather. The first carrier night-landing was made by a Blackburn Dart on 6 May 1926 aboard Furious.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the first practical jet engines in the late-World War II period led to calls for new jet-powered versions of <b>practically</b> <b>every</b> aircraft then flying. Among these was {{the design of a}} replacement for the de Havilland Mosquito, at that time among the world's leading light bombers. The Mosquito had been designed with the express intent of lightening the aircraft in order to improve its speed as much as possible, a process that led to the removal of all defensive armament, improving performance {{to the point where it}} was unnecessary anyway. This high-speed approach was extremely successful, and a jet-powered version would be even more difficult to intercept.|$|E
5|$|The {{transfer}} of 750 noncommissioned officers (NCOs) from the 1st Cavalry Division to the 24th and 25th Infantry Divisions, a move aimed at strengthening the infantry divisions combat missions in Korea, had weakened the 1st Cavalry Division. It {{had been stripped}} of <b>practically</b> <b>every</b> NCO except the first sergeants of companies and batteries in the division. Even though it had received 1,450 replacements before it left Japan, 100 {{of them from the}} Eighth Army stockade, the division was understrength when it landed in Korea and, like the preceding divisions, it had only two battalions in its three regiments, two firing batteries in the artillery battalions, and one tank company with M24 light tanks.|$|E

In the 1920s, the ship commonly carried one flight of fighters (Fairey Flycatcher), two of spotters (Blackburn Blackburn or Avro Bison), one spotter reconnaissance (Fairey IIID) and two flights of torpedo bombers (Blackburn Dart), each usually of six aircraft.|$|E
5|$|<b>Practically</b> <b>every</b> imaginable posture {{has been}} {{suggested}} for Plateosaurus in the scientific literature at some point. Von Huene assumed digitigrade bipedality with erect hind limbs for the animals he excavated at Trossingen, with the backbone held at a steep angle (at least during rapid locomotion). In contrast, Jaekel, the main investigator of the Halberstadt material, initially concluded that the animals walked quadrupedally, like lizards, with a sprawling limb position, plantigrade feet, and laterally undulating the body. Only a year later, Jaekel instead favoured a clumsy, kangaroo-like hopping, {{a change of heart}} for which he was mocked by German zoologist Gustav Tornier, who interpreted the shape of the articulation surfaces in the hip and shoulder as typically reptilian. Fraas, the first excavator of the Trossingen lagerstätte, also favoured a reptilian posture. Müller-Stoll listed a number of characters required for an erect limb posture that Plateosaurus supposedly lacked, concluding that the lizard-like reconstructions were correct. However, most of these adaptations are actually present in Plateosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The SPARS were {{assigned}} to every USCG district except Puerto Rico, and served in Hawaii and Alaska as well. Most officers held general duty billets, which included administrative and supervisory assignments. Other officers served as communication officers, supply officers, barracks, and recruiting officers. The bulk of the enlisted women performed clerical and stenographic duties. In smaller numbers, the enlisted personnel were found in <b>practically</b> <b>every</b> other billet, from baking pies to rigging parachutes and driving jeeps. A select group of SPAR officers and enlisted personnel were also assigned {{to work with the}} Long Range Aid to Navigation at monitoring stations in the Continental United States. Better known under the acronym LORAN, it was a top-secret radio navigation system developed for ships at sea and long-range aircraft. The first monitoring station staffed by SPARS was at Chatham, Massachusetts. Chatham {{is believed to have been}} (at the time) the only all female-staffed station of its kind in the world. The SPARS peak strength was approximately 11,000 officers and enlisted personnel. Commodore J. A. Hirschfield, USCG, said the SPARS volunteered for duty when their country needed them, and they did their jobs with enthusiasm, efficiency, and with a minimum of fanfare. To honor the SPARS, two USCG cutters were given their name.|$|E

30|$|This naive {{strategy}} [8] {{belongs to}} a category of routing protocols achieving very low delay at very high cost. It is indeed the optimum for what concern the delay performance. <b>Practically</b> speaking, <b>every</b> time a node is in contact with any other node it sends the bundle. It is easy {{to realize that the}} number of bundles present in the network grows exponentially in time. This diffusion enhances the probability that one of the bundles reaches the destination but, most of the time, its cost is unbearable for real networks. We use epidemic routing for a lower bound delay performance.|$|R
5000|$|In Indonesia tipping {{is common}} in large tourist areas, such as Bali or Lombok. 10% is {{expected}} at full-service restaurants. Bar tipping is discretional and depends on {{the style of a}} bar: in Bali, most bars are owned by expatriates and, normally, expat's country of origin reflects the style of a bar. Pubs do not expect tips. Restaurants - 10% to 15%. High end bars accepts over-the-counter cash tips in any amount. Massage parlous, which are located <b>practically</b> on <b>every</b> corner in Bali, expect 10%-20%. Taxi drivers expect 5%. Bellboys at high end hotels expect around $1 per bag.|$|R
