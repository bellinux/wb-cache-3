40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to present the {{methodology}} currently followed in the offshore industry for the prediction of the pile fatigue induced by pile hammering during installation. A few decades ago piles were thicker, of lower yield stress and hammers were less efficient. Today, to be cost effective, it is common to use high strength steel resulting in lower <b>pile</b> <b>thickness</b> and increased driving stress together with better hammer efficiency to reduce installation time. Hence fatigue damages are more important. Evaluation of fatigue damages depend on various parameters such as applied stresses, number of blows, Stress Concentration Factor (SCF) and S-N curves. It is shown how fatigue damages are dependant on the choice of the values used for the SCF and S-N curves and also on applied stresses by the hammer, and in the end the impact of these parameters on the residual available fatigue life for the in-place conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to (1) perform a quantitative underwa-ter corrosion inspection and as-sessment of sheet pile along the Cuyahoga River at Cleveland and (2) use the measured material thicknesses and corrosion rates to predict a probable future range of sheet <b>pile</b> <b>thickness.</b> The work was conducted in response to The Water Resources Development Act of 1996, Section 438, which directs the Army to project the cost of repairing and/or replacing all sheet pile along the Cuyahoga River. This Phase 2 work was a follow-on condition assessment, conducted by the U. S. Army Construction Engineering Re-search Laboratory (CERL), using a remotely controlled submersible robotic inspection system in conjunction with conventional hand-held acoustic thickness probes. Data were collected from 12 sites over a period of 1 week, Based on the data sample collected during the limited time frame of the study, a bounded, steady-state projection of future sheet pile condition was made for each site. Because corrosion rates correlate directly to the degree of zebra mussel infestation, these condition projections may be too conservative if zebra mussel infestation proceeds significantly faster than assumed in this study.

40|$|Pile {{foundations}} are slender {{structural elements}} used to transfer loads from super structure into deep hard strata below the ground level. However, single piles are rarely found in practice. It is quite complicated to analyze pile groups since pile soil interaction is complex. In this study, {{two dimensional analysis}} of pile group under vertical load is carried out using finite element software ANSYS. Pile group has 16 numbers of piles and it is located in c-ø soil, parameters like diameter (0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 4, 0. 5, 0. 6, 0. 7, 0. 8 m), length (3, 4, 5, 6 m) and spacing of piles (2 D, 2. 5 D, 3 D, 3. 5 D, 4 D) and <b>thickness</b> of <b>pile</b> cap (0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8, 1. 0, 1. 2, 1. 4 m) are varied to study the behavior of pile group.

Nonlinearity of the piles was treated under the assumption of a hyperbolic stress-strain relationship. The pile cap was assumed as plate elements. The analysis conducted {{in this study is}} the moment distribution within the cap. Comparison was made for distribution under a constant stiffness and varying stiffness assumptions. The effect of pile cap stiffness on bending moment was demonstrated for the analysis. The distribution of bending moments along the two considered sections for cap thickness of 3 m, the piles are assumed to have linear behavior. The bending moments have the lowest value at the ends of sections. The bending moment increased when moving towards the center of cap until reaching the maximum value. For <b>pile</b> <b>thickness</b> of 1. 0 m to 4. 0 m, the maximum bending moment was found to be located between center line of the pile cap and edges.

40|$|Geological and {{structural}} analyses and ground deformation measurements performed {{along the eastern}} portion of the Pernicana fault system and its splay segments allow the structural setting and the kinematic behaviour of the fault to be defined. In addition, the interrelationship between the deformation style of fault segments and the variations of the volcanic <b>pile</b> <b>thickness</b> along the fault strike are investigated using detailed sedimentary basement data. Brittle deformation dominates the N 105 ° fault segment, where the volcanic pile is more than 200 m thick, {{with the development of}} a well-defined fault plane characterised by main left-lateral kinematics. The transtensive deformation of the N 105 ° fault is partitioned eastward at Rocca Campana to a main N 120 ° segment. Here, this segment crosses a culmination of the sedimentary basement close to Vena village where the deformation pattern of the thin volcanic pile, less than 100 m thick, is influenced by the more ductile behaviour of the basement generating local short structures with different orientation and kinematics in the southern block of the fault. On the northern one, short E–W trending faults show left-lateral displacements with a minor reverse component on south-dipping planes. This kinematics is related to the oblique orientation of the N 120 ° segment with respect to the seaward motion of the NE flank of Etna. On the whole, the compressive component of the deformation affecting the N 120 ° segment of the Pernicana fault system generates a positive flower structure...|$|E
40|$|The seismic {{record of}} recent sediments of the Rhone delta in Lake Geneva (Switzerland, France) {{presents}} a discontinuity {{over a large}} area of the delta. Previous studies hypothesized that sediments inducing this discontinuity could originate from a giant rock fall (named Tauredunum) {{that occurred in the}} Lake Geneva watershed in 583 AD. To verify this hypothesis, two long cores have been retrieved from the lake sediments in the region where the sediment <b>pile</b> <b>thickness</b> is reduced. The sediment sequence presented three major units, with an upper, fine grained and laminated sediments (Unit A), and intermediate unit consisting of alternating coarse and fine grained sediments (Unit B), and a lower unit (Unit C) with sediment characteristics comparable to Unit (A). Unit B was interpreted as sediments inducing the seismic discontinuity. Two organic remains were sampled in Unit B and Unit A, and dated by AMS 14 C to 1390 - 1440 cal. AD and 1680 - 1780 cal. AD, respectively. The base of Unit B was dated by extrapolation to 1310 cal. AD that is more than six centuries after the Tauredunum rock fall. Moreover, the structure of the intermediate unit was interpreted as a succession of turbidite deposits and hemipelagic sedimentation. The mode of deposition of the sediments and, mainly, the AMS 14 C dating of organic remains invalidate the hypothesis of an origin of the intermediate unit in relation to the Tauredunum rock fall. Possible processes are larger inputs (as compared to present time) of detrital material during the “Little Ice Age” and a shift in the sand lobes at the end of sub-lacustrine canyons...|$|E

40|$|Corrosion {{of steel}} {{structures}} in the marine environment is a major problem. The deterioration {{of this kind of}} structures is costly and difficult to predict both when designing new structures and when estimating the remaining service life time for existing structures. The aim of this investigation was to find indicative values for the corrosion rate of steel sheet piles on the Swedish west coast. Such corrosion rates (mm/year) can be used both when designing new structures by oversizing the steel thickness and when estimating the bearing capacity of existing sheet pile structures. Earlier investigations on the corrosion rates along the Swedish east coast – with salinity from about 0. 2 % - 0. 8 % – are still used today as guidelines for the corrosion rate of all steel {{structures in the}} Swedish maritime environment even though the salinity on the west coast can be as high as 3. 0 %. Steel sheet pile wharfs located in the port of Halmstad on the Swedish west coast were inspected by ultrasonic measurements. Three wharf structures with a total length of about 700 m were inspected. None of the inspected wharfs had or have had cathodic protection. The thickness measurements of the steel sheet pile structures were performed by divers. The age of the three inspected sheet pile structures ranged from 36 to 51 years. The dimensions of the original sheet pile sections are known. One of the quay structures is located along a river. The salinity at all wharfs varied from low values at the surface to approx. 2 % at the bottom (also in the river outflow). The measured average corrosion rates were in the same order as the design values in the European code. However, the results indicate increased corrosion rates about one meter below the mean water surface and {{at the level of the}} propellers from the ships berthing the most frequented of the inspected wharfs, 3 to 6 meters below water surface. The tolerances of steel sheet thicknesses – usually in the order of ± 6 % – are often neglected when investigating the remaining thickness in steel sheet piles. A simple calculation model shows that the sheet pile must be almost 50 years of age before an accurate estimation on the corrosion rate can be made, considering the tolerances, if the true original sheet <b>pile</b> <b>thickness</b> is not known...|$|E
40|$|In Northern Iceland, {{the active}} rift is located 120 km eastward {{with respect to}} the Kolbeinsey Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The Tjörnes Fracture Zone connects these two rifts and {{accommodates}} a dextral transform motion. A major active fault of the Tjörnes Fracture Zone is the WNW-ESE trending Húsavík-Flatey Fault (HFF). The seismic activity associated to the HFF defined a nearly vertical fault surface that cuts through the 12 km thick seismogenic crust. Analyses of major structures combined with inversion of fault slip data allow us to discuss the kinematics and mechanics of the HFF since the Late Tertiary. For the present-day kinematics, we also use inversion of earthquake focal mechanisms provided by the Icelandic Meteorological Office. The main state of stress along the HFF corresponds to a dextral transtension, with an ENE-WSW trending extension due to the obliquity of the transform fault relative to the E-W direction of plate divergence. This overall mechanism is subject to slip partitioning that include an extension trending NW-SE, parallel to the HFF, and an extension trending NE-SW, perpendicular to the fault. These three regimes do not reflect a succession in time of tectonic events, but occur simultaneously at different places and in various chronological orders. They are thought to express the geometric accommodation of the transform motion in the oblique transform zone. Near the connection of the HFF to the Kolbeinsey Ridge, most dextral transform faults that trend parallel to the HFF are replaced by normal faults with a dextral component. On {{the opposite side of the}} HFF, at its junction with the northern Icelandic rift, two main transform fault segments have been mapped out. The northern fault directly connects to the northern Icelandic rift as a triple point junction, whereas the southern one progressively evolves from a WNW-ESE trending dextral transform fault to a N-S trending normal fault, parallel to the direction of the rift structures. One hypothesis, which would explain these structural differences, involves the presence of pre-existing structures, like volcanoes, that affect the direction of propagation of the southern transform fault segment. Another hypothesis would be that the southern transform fault, the oldest between these two transform faults, developed and then was connected to the northern Icelandic rift before the rift propagated northward. After this northward propagation of the northern Icelandic rift, the northern transform fault segment propagated linearly to the rift. Moreover, near the junction of the HFF with the northern Icelandic rift, the behaviour of the normal faults associated with the rift appears to be strongly influenced by the dextral transtension characterising the HFF. On other hand, seismic faults have been mapped out near the eastern border of the Flateyjarskagi shelf. Inversions of related focal mechanisms suggest that movements associated with the present-day unlocking of the eastern part of the HFF, considered as locked until recently because of its low seismic activity, are compatible with the proposed model of dextral transtension. The present-day offset between the Kolbeinsey Ridge and the northern Icelandic rift results from an eastward rift jump of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in Iceland. As the North American-Eurasian plate boundary drifts westward, eastward rift jumps relocate the rift zones above the Icelandic hotspot. Using 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of dykes along a profile parallel to the direction of plate motion in Northern Iceland, a paleo-rift axis has been recognised 60 km eastward to the previously accepted location. This paleo-rift, localised in the continuation of fjord of Skagafjördur and referred to as, remained active until approximately 3 Ma ago. The activity of the northern Icelandic rift started about 8 - 8. 5 My ago, intruding the presently dated 9 - 9. 5 Ma old eastern flank of the Skagafjördur paleo-rift. This age of 1 Ma for the intruded paleo-rift rocks at the rift jump time is considered as a minimal value, resulting to hypotheses assumed in the theoretical model for the dating data interpretation. An important plio-pleistocene glacial erosion, inducing a decrease of the lava <b>pile</b> <b>thickness</b> and thus a diminution of the area covered by the production of the northern Icelandic rift, would explain the presence of dykes related to the northern Icelandic rift as far as 25 km outside of its borders. The two rifts were thus simultaneously active during 5 - 5. 5 Ma. During this period, the accretion rates along the two rift zones were nearly equal. However, accretion was asymmetrical along each rift, with the higher rate of accretion situated on the external flank. The supposed absence of drift from the northern Icelandic rift since its initiation implies a strong asymmetry of accretion, favouring the Northern American plate. A decrease of the hotspot activity would release the northern Icelandic rift and allow it to drift westward with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Then, an increase of the hotspot activity would facilitate the shift of the accretion zone above to the hotspot by an eastward rift jump. The tectonic changes related to the last rift jump explains the observed deformations in Northern Iceland. The Skagafjördur paleo-rift shrank, after it became extinct, both towards the Kolbeinsey Ridge and towards the active volcanic zone of central Iceland. This volcanic zone of central Iceland probably corresponds to an "en échelon" zone between the northern and the southern Icelandic rifts. The weight of the lava flows spread out by the volcanic zone of central Iceland since 3 Ma has induced a flexuring of the tertiary lava flow pile produced by the Skagafjördur paleo-rift. In a similar way, the lava flows erupted by the Skagafjördur paleo-rift have been flexured by those erupted by the northern Icelandic rift. These flexures are directed towards the volcanic zone of central Iceland and towards the northern Icelandic rift, respectively. They define a continuous flexure belt through Northern Iceland. An important extensive fracturing is related to the flexure of the lava flows. Such a flexure would explain that the synform-like arrangement of the lava flows, considered as a characteristic of an Icelandic rift axis, is absent along the southern part of the Skagafjördur paleo-rift axis, whereas such a structural shape is recognised along its northern part. The synform that was initially thought to localise the axis of the paleo-rift would be the axis of the flexural zone produced by the weight of plio-pleistocene lava flows erupted from the south, in the volcanic zone of central Iceland. Despite the limited number of radiochronological data available as time constraints in Southern Iceland, a global model of the tectonic evolution of the island, based on the model proposed for the evolution of Northern Iceland, is presented. This model highlights the importance of the volcanic zone of central Iceland. This volcanic zone would accommodate the differences in the tectonic evolution, like diachronisms in rift jump process and consequently shifts of the accretion zones, between the northern and southern parts of Iceland. Le rift nord islandais peut être considéré comme l'équivalent émergé de la dorsale de Kolbeinsey. Il est cependant décalé de 120 km vers l'est par rapport à celle-ci. La Zone de Fracture de Tjörnes, une zone transformante dextre, absorbe ce décalage. L'analyse des grandes structures ainsi que l'inversion de données de failles à stries ont permis de caractériser la géométrie et le fonctionnement de la faille d'Húsavík-Flatey (FHF), l'une des structures majeures de la Zone de Fracture de Tjörnes. L'inversion de mécanismes au foyer, fournis par l'Office Météorologique Islandais, a permis de compléter l'étude, pour la période actuelle. L'obliquité de la FHF, de direction WNW-ESE, par rapport à la divergence des plaques de direction E-W induit depuis la fin du Tertiaire une transtension dextre de direction ENE-WSW le long de la FHF. Ce mouvement transtensif se partitionne localement en une extension de direction NE-SW, sub-perpendiculaire à la FHF, et une extension de direction NW-SE, sub-parallèle à la FHF. Ces trois régimes ne correspondent pas à une succession bien définie d'épisodes régionaux mais à des variations locales et temporelles du mouvement transformant. A proximité de la jonction de la FHF avec la dorsale de Kolbeinsey, les failles dextres qui accommodent principalement le mouvement décrochant sont majoritairement remplacées par des failles normales à composante dextre. A l'autre extrémité de la FHF, au niveau de sa jonction avec le rift nord islandais, la faille est divisée en deux branches parallèles. L'une d'elles se connecte directement au rift nord islandais en définissant un point triple tandis que l'autre branche évolue progressivement d'une faille transformante de direction WNW-ESE jusqu'à une faille normale de direction N-S parallèle au rift. Ces différences structurales s'expliqueraient par la propagation vers le nord du rift nord islandais ainsi que par l'influence de structures préexistantes, telles que des volcans, lors du développement de ces deux failles. De plus, le fonctionnement du rift nord islandais à proximité de la FHF paraît fortement influencé par celui de cette dernière. Enfin, l'activité séismique liée à l'actuel déblocage de la partie de la FHF bloquée depuis la dernière crise éruptive du rift nord islandais s'intégrerait dans le modèle de fonctionnement en transtension dextre de cette faille. Le décalage du rift nord islandais et de la dorsale de Kolbeinsey résulte d'un saut vers l'est de la zone d'accrétion nord islandaise. La dérive vers l'ouest de la dorsale médio-Atlantique par rapport au point chaud islandais serait à l'origine de tels sauts. A partir de datations 40 Ar/ 39 Ar de dykes échantillonnés le long d'un profil parallèle à la direction de divergence des plaques, l'initiation de l'actuel rift nord islandais a été datée à 8 - 8. 5 Ma. Elle eut lieu dans des roches qui n'avaient alors que 1 Ma. Le paléo-rift, dont l'axe a été localisé le long du fjord de Skagafjördur, c'est-à-dire 60 km à l'est de l'emplacement généralement admis, et le rift actuel ont fonctionné simultanément et de façon asymétrique, l'accrétion étant plus importante sur leurs flancs extérieurs, jusqu'à 3 Ma. L'absence supposée de dérive du rift nord islandais par rapport au point chaud implique une très forte asymétrie d'accrétion de la plaque Nord Amérique par rapport à la plaque Eurasie. Si l'activité du point chaud venait à diminuer, le rift nord islandais pourrait être libéré et dériver vers l'ouest jusqu'à ce qu'un nouveau pulse mantellique provoque un saut de rift vers l'est et ramène la zone d'accrétion à l'aplomb du point chaud. Les déformations observées dans le Nord de l'Islande s'expliquent par la réorganisation tectonique liée au dernier saut de rift. Le mécanisme d'abandon du paléo-rift de Skagafjördur est interprété comme un retrait symétrique et synchrone vers la ride de Kolbeinsey et vers la zone volcanique du centre de l'Islande, cette dernière constituant probablement une zone de relais entre les rifts nord et sud islandais. Le poids des laves émises depuis 3 Ma par la zone volcanique du centre de l'Islande a provoqué une flexuration des laves issues du paléo-rift vers le centre de l'Islande de la même manière qu'elles ont été flexurées par et en direction de celles émises par le rift nord islandais. Cette profonde réorganisation structurale expliquerait l'absence d'une synforme le long de la partie méridionale du paléo-rift de Skagafjördur alors qu'une telle synforme, caractéristique d'un rift en Islande, est présente le long de sa partie septentrionale. La synforme initialement considérée comme localisant l'axe du paléo-rift dans le Nord de l'Islande ne serait alors que l'axe d'une zone de flexure due à l'épanchement des laves plio-pléistocènes. Malgré la faible quantité de données radiochronologiques disponibles pour la partie sud de l'Islande, le modèle d'évolution tectonique proposé pour le Nord de l'Islande a été intégré dans un schéma d'évolution de l'ensemble de l'île. En accommodant les différences d'évolution entre les parties nord et sud de l'île, telles que le diachronisme entre les sauts de rift ayant eu lieu dans ces deux parties de l'Islande et donc le décalage des zones d'accrétion au travers de l'île, la zone volcanique du centre de l'Islande a ainsi joué un rôle primordial tout le long du développement de l'île...|$|E

The present study was performed to improve the knowledge resulting from all the previous magnetotelluric (MT) studies focused particularly on characterizing the western border of the Rio de la Plata Craton. MT data were acquired along an approximately NW-SE 750 km profile at about 24 ºS, from the Sub Andean Ranges in the province of Salta (NW) to the boundary Formosa Province frontier (SE) next to Paraguay River. Distortion and structure dimensionality analysis indicates that MT responses are two-dimensional with a NS strike orientation, consistent with the regional geological strike. A 2 D inversion of the data provided a model showing a sharp lateral discontinuity, possibly associated with cratonic structures. The high resistivity (> 5000 ohm-m) observed, from about the middle of the profile toward its eastern end, may be interpreted as the terranes accreted to the Río de la Plata Craton during Neoproterozoic to Cambrian times, or even as the Río de la Plata Craton itself. Along the profile from the surface to a depth of about 10 km the resistivity model shows a significant resistivity variation in the structure.

Through the optimized analysis, it is put forward that bearing stratum of pile tip should select a relatively better soil layer, the diameter of CFG pile is usually appropriately to select between 350 mm and 500 mm, it is usually appropriately to select larger pile spacing under the permissible range between 3 d and 5 d being ruled by standard, it is appropriately to enlarge the pile diameter to reduce the requirement of pile strength in high rise and super high rise building which requiring bearing capacity of single pile is high, and the thickness of cushion layer is appropriately to select between 0. 4 and 0. 6 times of the pile diameter...|$|R
40|$|Liquefaction {{is one of}} {{the leading}} seismic actions to cause {{extensive}} damage to buildings and infrastructure during earthquakes. In many historic cases, plastic hinge formations in piles were observed at inexplicable locations. This project investigates the behaviour of piled foundations within soils susceptible to liquefaction using numerical analysis carried out in Abaqus in terms of plastic hinge development. Three different soil profiles were considered in this project by varying the thickness of both the liquefiable and non-liquefiable layers, pile length, free and fixed head pile conditions. Modelling a single pile as a beam-column element carrying both axial and El-Centro record earthquake loading produced results of the seismic behaviour of piles that could be assessed by Force-Based Seismic Design (FBSD) approaches. The displacements and deformations induced by dynamic loads were analysed for piles affected by liquefaction and the results used to demonstrate the pile capacity and discuss the damage patterns and location of plastic hinges. Parametric studies generally demonstrate that plastic hinge formation occurs at the boundaries of the liquefiable and non-liquefiable layers; however, the location can be affected by a variety of factors such as material properties, <b>pile</b> length and <b>thickness</b> of liquefying soil layer...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT 3 -D Modeling of Piled Raft Foundation Anup Sinha, Ph. D. Concordia University, 2013 Piled-raft-foundation {{is a new}} concept, {{which has}} {{received}} increasing recognition in recent years. Current design practice is based on conventional group pile or block failure theory, that ignore the bearing contribution from the raft. Moreover, the pile group theory is incapable of predicting the differential settlement of the raft, which is beyond the capability of any available analytical method in the literature. The objective of this thesis is to develop analytical models capable to predict the settlement of each individual pile in the group under the raft. Accordingly, the differential settlement within the pile raft can be estimated. In this investigation, three independent models will be developed to perform as follows; first, the load sharing model that estimates the load components of the raft and the pile group in the system, the second model is to estimate the maximum settlement {{of the top of}} the raft and the third model is to estimate the differential settlement among the pile-raft-foundation. To develop these analytical models, the three dimensional numerical models developed in ABAQUS platform, was extensively used. The extent of stress influence zone, sensitivity analysis of the governing parameters, time increment of the analysis step were performed in advance. The modified Drucker – Pager cap plasticity was used to model the soil continuum. The influence of pile cross-sectional shape (square, octagonal and circular) on soil bearing behavior was examined to check the suitability of using the 8 -noded hexahedron 3 D brick element. Parametric studies were performed to observe the influence of raft and pile geometry (e. g length, size, spacing of <b>pile</b> and <b>thickness</b> of raft) on the foundation bearing behavior. The raft bearing contribution and its top deflection pattern under various loading and pile-raft configuration were also investigated. The multiple regression analysis technique, using statistical software MINITAB, along with the theory of solid mechanics was used to develop the analytical models for load sharing, maximum and differential settlement. Design theories and recommendation for future work are presented. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{combustion}} of shale, a porous sedimentary rock, {{has been}} reported at times in outcrop deposits and mining piles. However, the initiating event of most of these fires is unknown. It could be that, under the right conditions, shale rock undergoes spontaneous exothermic reactions {{in the presence of}} oxygen. This work studies experimentally {{and for the first time}} the self-heating behavior of shale rock. Because shale has high inert content, novel diagnostics such as mass loss measurements and visual observation of charring are introduced to detect self-heating ignition in respect to other self-heating materials with lower inter content. Using field samples collected from the outcrop at Kimmeridge Bay (UK) and the Frank-Kamenetskii theory of ignition, we determine the effective kinetic parameters for two particle-size distributions of shale. These parameters are then used to upscale the results to geological deposits and mining <b>piles</b> of different <b>thicknesses.</b> We show that for fine particles, with diameter below 2 mm, spontaneous ignition is possible for deposits of thickness between 10. 7 m and 607 m at ambient temperatures between − 20 ᵒC and 44 ᵒC. For the same ambient temperature range, the critical thickness is in excess of 30 km for deposits made of coarse particles with diameter below 17 mm. Our results indicate that shale rock is reactive, with reactivity highly dependent on particle diameter, and that self-ignition is possible for small particles in outcrops, piles or geological deposits accidentally exposed to oxygen...|$|R

60|$|The {{researches}} of Schroeder and Dusch in 1854, and of Schroeder alone, in 1859, {{cleared up}} this point by experiments which are simply refinements upon those of Redi. A lump of cotton-wool is, physically speaking, a <b>pile</b> of many <b>thicknesses</b> {{of a very}} fine gauze, the fineness of the meshes of which depends upon {{the closeness of the}} compression of the wool. Now, Schroeder and Dusch found, that, in the case of all the putrefiable materials which they used (except milk and yolk of egg), an infusion boiled, and then allowed to come into contact with no air but such as had been filtered through cotton-wool, neither putrefied, nor fermented, nor developed living forms. It is hard to imagine what the fine sieve formed by the cotton-wool could have stopped except minute solid particles. Still the evidence was incomplete until it had been positively shown, first, that ordinary air does contain such particles; and, secondly, that filtration through cotton-wool arrests these particles and allows only physically pure air to pass. This demonstration has been furnished within the last year by the remarkable experiments of Professor Tyndall. It has been a common objection of Abiogenists that, if the doctrine of Biogeny is true, the air must be thick with germs; and they regard this as the height of absurdity. But nature occasionally is exceedingly unreasonable, and Professor Tyndall has proved that this particular absurdity may nevertheless be a reality. He has demonstrated that ordinary air is no better than a sort of stirabout of excessively minute solid particles; that these particles are almost wholly destructible by heat; and that they are strained off, and the air rendered optically pure, by its being passed through cotton-wool.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the reuse and the optimum design of piled raft foundations using numerical analysis. The solution proposed for reusing foundations is {{the design of}} a piled raft foundation capable of supporting successive buildings. A raft foundation, with a limited number of piles located strategically beneath the raft and utilising a high proportion of the ultimate load capacity, is considered the most efficient design when the raft foundation alone provides sufficient load capacity, {{but at the same time}} settlements are excessive. This is the case in high plasticity stiff clays such as London Clay. When building on old piles, these piles had to sustain a certain load from the previous structure over a period of time, during which the soil is subjected to the time-related processes of consolidation and creep. A time dependent constitutive model, capable of reproducing several aspects of the time dependent behaviour of soils including creep and isotach viscosity, is employed in the finite element analyses. The model parameters are calibrated with the results of laboratory tests on London Clay, whose time dependent behaviour in its natural state is characterised by isotach viscosity, rate dependent peak strength and rate independent critical state line. Preliminary analyses of single piles indicate that the consolidation processes in the ground result in little gain in capacity in the long term, whereas creep results in increased capacity. A back-analysis of documented piled load tests in London Clay is performed, where the effects of pile installation are quantified. Numerical model calibration is performed with the documented observations of a well instrumented piled raft foundation at Stonebridge Park, London. 3 D parametric analyses of piled raft foundations are then performed, in order to assess the appropriate location and dimensions of <b>piles</b> and raft <b>thickness.</b> The performance of piled raft foundations with time is assessed parametrically at different levels of preloading. Optimisation of the performance of the piled raft foundation at Stonebridge Park is attempted by examining several pile arrangements, where a central pile support with a limited number of piles is more cost-effective than the original design.

40|$|A {{synthesis}} {{of the development of}} the Variscan orogene, of which the present Cantabrian Mountains form only a part, was given by Matte (1968). Wagner (1970) presented a general outline of Carboniferous stratigraphy in this area. For purposes of a general background it is sufficient to state that from the Lower Cambrian {{until the end of the}} Devonian, sedimentation in this area was typical of a stable shelf environment. Formations can be traced over tens to hundreds of kilometres and most sediments are evidently shallow water deposits. This entire sedimentary <b>pile</b> has a <b>thickness</b> in the order of 2 to 3 km. Towards the end of the Devonian, uplift and erosion (de Sitter, 1965; van Adrichem Boogaert, 1967), resulted in an important hiatus in the central Asturian area and along part of the Leon line. This uplift was followed by another period of very uniform sedimentation during which limestones were deposited in most of the Cantabrian Mountains. This relatively uniform picture changed drastically during the lower and middle Westphalian, when the important Curavacas folding phase (Palentian phase of Wagner & Wagner-Gentis, 1963) occurred. The sediments deposited after these tectonic movements are partly preserved in a number of so-called "basins" (de Sitter, 1965). These "basins" (Fig. 2) are mainly tectonic units which are merely fragments of the originally much more extensive sedimentary basins. These Upper Carboniferous sediments contrast strongly with the earlier ones in that they are typified by great lateral and vertical variability and by their great thickness. The Westphalian alone, for instance, is over 4000 m thick in many places. SUBJECT OF STUDY In these Westphalian deposits marine and non-marine strata show rapid lateral and vertical transitions into one another. In the marine parts of the sequences limestones are common. Some of these limestones can be traced for several kilometres; others, however, abruptly wedge out or interfinger with siliciclastic deposits. Isolated lenses, sometimes forming a distinct band, may also occur. The cause(s) of these irregularities in the limestone deposits was (were) the original subject of this study. It was soon realized that these causes could not be understood unless the limestones were studied together with the surrounding siliciclastics on a regional scale. The Pisuerga area, from which published paleontological data were available, was selected for this study. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the behaviour of a granular scour protection around piles when the bed is subjected to bed degradation. Furthermore, engineering guidelines are provided to account for bed degradation {{in the design of}} the initial scour protection. To address the behaviour of the protection, a physical model is used and to obtain the engineering guidelines, a theoretical approach is used which includes the phenomena that are observed during the physical model tests. As stated by many authors [Breusers et al., 1991; Chiew, 2004; Melville et al., 2000], a granular scour protection around a pile can fail due to several mechanisms. In clear-water conditions these mechanisms include shear failure, winnowing and edge scour and in live-bed conditions two other mechanisms can be added, namely bed degradation and bed form induced failure. This {{research focuses on}} the bed degradation mechanism, which can endanger the granular scour protection around a pile. Just like Van der Hoeven [2002] observed during his research on falling aprons, the stones spread evenly over the front and side slopes of the mound, which form after undermining of the protection has led to the ‘falling’ of the edge stones of the protection. This coverage of stones on the slopes of the mound effectively rearmoured the slopes and prevented further erosion. At the back of the mound this rearmouring is not observed, because the high turbulence levels, introduced by both the mound and the pile, caused stones to become unstable in this area. Furthermore, at the front and side slopes, where the slope of the mound was totally covered by the stones of the protection, the slope angles were constant and comparable to the slope angles that Van der Hoeven found in his research, namely 1 : 2, 0. However, a remarkable difference between the observations of Van der Hoeven and the observations of the current research concerns the layer thickness of the protection on the slope. Van der Hoeven observed that the layer thickness after launching of the apron was only 1 *df, 50 thick, while the current observations show a decreasing layer thickness from the top of the slope to the toe of the mound. The theoretical approach that is used to develop a design formula focuses on the side slopes, where the flow is parallel to the interface between stones and base material. A balance between the volume of the initial protection and the required volume of stones after bed degradation has led to the formulation of the internal slope angle, ?. This angle describes the assumed linearly decreasing thickness along the slope, starting with a certain required thickness at the top, Df,A, to a thickness of only 1 *df, 50 at the bottom. Because the hydraulic load decreases with increasing distance from the <b>pile</b> and the <b>thickness</b> of the initial protection is based on the maximum load near the pile, the assumption that Df,A is equal to the initial thickness of the protection, leads to a conservative design formula. This approach is however taken in the development of the simplified design formula, which results in a linear relation between the bed degradation and the extra extent of the initial protection that should be constructed to deal with that bed degradation.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{different}} models are considered which {{can deal with}} the interaction between pile foundations and structures. This to find {{the most efficient way to}} model pile foundation structures whereby both the efficiency of the design as building process are taken into account. This are the models D-Pile (geotechnical), Scia Engineer (structural) and Plaxis (geotechnical). Therefore a study is done to the effects which play a role by pile foundation structures and or the different models can deal with this. The study focused on displacement piles which is the most used pile type in the Dutch building practice. The reference project which is used for this study is the foundation structure of a power pylon (as shown in figure 1) To get trust in the models after this study a verification is done for single piles which were subjected to an axial (compression and tension) and horizontal load on top. For piles loaded by axial compression the load-settlement behaviour is compared with the behaviour as one can determine according to NEN 9997 - 1 (EC 7). Hereby one can see that the fact that the numerical model Plaxis does not take into account the installation effects (densification and displacement of the soil around the pile) leads to a deviating load-settlement behaviour in comparison with the behaviour of the other models which are based on empirical relationship (pile tests). This behaviour can be improved by additional tricks like volume expansions of the soil around the pile, but this is not taken into account in this thesis. So therefore Plaxis was not taken into account furthermore. After the verification of single piles, the verification was expanded for pile groups which was subjected to the same loading conditions. Hereby variations were made in the centre-to-centre distances of the <b>piles</b> and the <b>thickness</b> of the cap on top. Hereby can be noticed that the fact that D-Pile cannot take into account the bending stiffness of the pile cap can lead to an unrealistic distribution of pile forces in case of a thin plate with large centre-to-centre distances of the piles. On the other hand the additional settlement of a pile group in comparison with a single pile cannot be taken into account with the chose way of modeling in Scia Engineer, but only by D-Pile. The behaviour of pile groups loaded by tension can differ significant from single piles This effect has to be taken into account manually in both models. For a horizontally loaded group there is a significant difference in results in the bending moments in the pile heads and the displacement of the pile cap, which is caused by the different horizontal springs used in the models. Combining all these knowledge leads to the conclusion that Scia Engineer seems to be the best model for the design of the foundation structure of the power pylon. Hereby both the efficiency of the design process and the structure are taken into account. The reassons for this are: 9 ̆ 5 Besides D-Foundation which is a tool to determine the bearing capacity only one model is needed to analyse the behaviour of the piles and the foundation structure. This model is also used by the structural engineer to determine the distribution of forces and the reinforcement in the structure. 9 ̆ 5 The load-displacement behaviour of (tension) piles is governed by springs which are easy to adjust and it is easy to check if the behaviour is in line with the applicable standards. This is especially the case for tension piles, for which the bearing capacity is dependent on the pile-to-pile distance and the alternation between tensile and compressive loads.
