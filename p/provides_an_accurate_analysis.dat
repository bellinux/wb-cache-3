40|$|Road pricing is a {{transport}} measure mainly conceived to fund road management, {{to regulate}} the demand for traffic and {{to reduce the number}} of private vehicles circulating in urban areas. It can also grant benefits in terms of environmental externalities including the reduction of CO 2 emissions, which has recently become one of the most important elements defining the sustainability of a transport system. However, the carbon potential granted by road charging is rarely assessed economically, thus confirming a sort of secondary role attributed to CO 2 in urban premises. This paper <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>analysis</b> of the relationship between the different forms of road pricing (distance-based, congestion-based and pay-as-you-drive) and their effective role in terms of carbon reduction, which in some contexts is significant, accounting for an overall percentage higher than 10 %.

40|$|A common {{approach}} to the formal description of pictorial and visual languages makes use of formal grammars and rewriting mechanisms. The present paper {{is concerned with the}} formalism of Symbol–Relation Grammars (SR grammars, for short). Each sentence in an SR language is composed of a set of symbol occurrences representing visual elementary objects, which are related through a set of binary relational items. The main feature of SR grammars is the uniform way they use context-free productions to rewrite symbol occurrences as well as relation items. The clearness and uniformity of the derivation process for SR grammars allow the extension of well-established techniques of syntactic and semantic analysis to the case of SR grammars. The paper <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>analysis</b> of the derivation mechanism and the expressive power of the SR formalism. This is necessary to fully exploit the capabilities of the model. The most meaningful features of SR grammars as well as their generative power are compared with those of well-known graph grammar families.

40|$|There are a {{significant}} amount of bridges under local government control currently in a state of severe degradation. To aid in rectifying this problem an analysis framework has been developed to enable rural local governments to determine appropriate bridge infrastructure replacement and repair options which satisfy the economic, social and environmental requirements of the organisation and of the community it serves. The framework utilises a structured analysis process which enables both the most appropriate position for the crossing and the most appropriate form of the crossing to be determined. The analysis process uses a numerical system to rate the performance of several options relative to the performance of the existing situation. The performance of the option is determined by considering a set of criteria developed to assess the economic, social and environmental characteristics of the proposal. The relative importance of each criterion to the goals of the organisation is also taken into consideration in the performance appraisal. To enable a thorough analysis each option is considered through three numerical scores representing the economic, social and environmental performance. Four case studies within the North Burnett Regional Council area have been developed to demonstrate the appropriate use of the framework within its intended environment. The framework developed <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>analysis</b> tool conducive to the time and resource constraints typical of rural local government engineering. ...|$|E

The topic is approached through a specific question, whose formulation I quote from the title of an article of Robert Stern: “Did Hegel hold an identity theory of truth?” (Stern 1993). In this context, the ‘identity theory of truth’ is {{to be understood as}} the claim that truth is the identity of a judgment’s content (i. e., a proposition) with a fact. The research <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>analysis</b> of those elements, involved both in Hegel’s conception of truth and in the identity theory of truth, that could lead one to interpret these views as one and the same.

Through the analysis of the meaning that each of these notions receives, respectively, within the identity theory of truth and the Hegelian conception of truth, it will possible to highlight some fundamental characters of the latter. My claim here is that the affinity one might see between the Hegelian elaboration and the ‘family’ of the identity theories of truth is just a superficial one. The great difference between the two compared standpoints in interpreting the aforementioned elements, shows that Hegel’s view about truth cannot be reduced to any of the identity theories on offer...|$|E

40|$|Nanoparticulate {{systems have}} emerged as {{valuable}} tools in vaccine delivery through their ability to efficiently deliver cargo, including proteins, to antigen presenting cells 1 - 5. Internalization of nanoparticles (NP) by antigen presenting cells is a critical step in generating an effective immune response to the encapsulated antigen. To determine how changes in nanoparticle formulation impact function, we sought to develop a high throughput, quantitative experimental protocol that was compatible with detecting internalized nanoparticles as well as bacteria. To date, two independent techniques, microscopy and flow cytometry, have been the methods used to study the phagocytosis of nanoparticles. The high throughput nature of flow cytometry generates robust statistical data. However, due to low resolution, it fails to accurately quantify internalized versus cell bound nanoparticles. Microscopy generates images with high spatial resolution; however, it is time consuming and involves small sample sizes 6 - 8.

40|$|A {{formulation}} of the lambda scheme {{for the analysis of}} two dimensional inviscid, compressible, unsteady transonic flows is presented. The scheme uses generalized Riemann variables to determine the appropriate two point, one sided finite difference approximation for each derivative in the unsteady Euler equations. These finite differences are applied at the predictor and corrector levels with shock updating at each level. The weaker oblique shocks are captured, but strong near normal shocks are fitted into the flow using the Rankine-Hugoniot relations. This code is demonstrated with a numerical example of a duct flow problem with developing normal and oblique shock waves. The technique is implemented in a code which has been made efficient by streamlining to a minimal number of operations and by eliminating branch statements.

In this paper we follow a slightly different approach, presenting a low complexity layered video transcoder (lvt) suitable for network-friendly multicast videoconference transmission. The transcoder approach permits the exploitation of layered distribution schemes with existing video tools or even with recordings, without necessarily having to act at the data source, and thus <b>providing</b> <b>an</b> easy path to the deployment of such services.
