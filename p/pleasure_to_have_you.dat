Perhaps my greatest debt, and the one I feel least equipped to repay, is to my advisor, Chuck Steidel. Chuck, I can never adequately thank you for taking me on as a first-year student, for trusting me with a project you care so deeply about, and for giving me the space and time to understand, appreciate, and eventually internalize the breadth of the field and the details of my work. It has been my great privilege and honor {{to be a part of}} your “group, ” to learn the craft you so artfully practice. Thank you for your six years of support, patience, and mentoring. I know no person with as great scientific creativity and intuition as you, and I hope that this work is something of which you can be proud. Along the way, I was fortunate to collect two other scientific mentors, Alice Shapley and Max Pettini, who have steadied me through the rocky moments during graduate school and have taught me a great deal about science and also about friendship. Max and Alice, it has been my great <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>you</b> bot...|$|R

40|$|Welcome to Salt Lake City! It {{is a great}} <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> {{attend the}} first edition of The International Conference on Image Formation in X-ray Computed Tomography, also nicknamed as The CT meeting. The idea for this meeting came two years ago, from a wish I {{formulated}} to have a venue where CT scientists could meet together to discuss in depth all aspects that impact the image formation process in CT. These aspects include dose evaluation and dose reduction strategies, non-linearity effects and compensation schemes for these effects, image reconstruction algorithms, spectral decomposition, dynamic effects, geometrical calibration, phase-contrast physics, and image quality assessment. Both medical imaging and non-destructive testing applications are of interest, along with emerging breast cone-beam tomography techniques, and the attractive micro- and nano-CT technology. To allow for in-depth discussion between the attendees, oral presentations have been allocated a significant time. Also, comfortable poster sessions have been planned, and shared meals have been organized in a quiet environment. Such a meeting could not be a success without scientific submissions. I am grateful to all attendees who submitted their work for presentation at this conference. The 4 -page format for abstract submission is demanding, but also a great way to guarantee high quality. Thank you for complying with this format. I was delighted by the quality and merit of the submissions...|$|E

40|$|Independet {{silent reading}} - Out of old habit or a lesson with purpose?  The {{aim of this}} study was to examine whether {{teachers}} use the method of independent silent reading purposefully or if they do it out of old habit. The research focuses on what purpose the teachers have and which working methods they use when working with silent reading. I investigated who it is that chooses the books to be read and what factors are determining this choise. Finally, I wanted to find out how the silent reading time is used by the pupils and the teachers. In order to investigate this, observations were made in classes during silent reading time and semistructured interviews were conducted with teachers and students. The results show that most teachers have a clear purpose with silent reading and that they work with different reading strategies to teach the children to become independent silent readers. However, an important part of succeeding in silent reading is that it happens on a regular basis, preferably every day.     Finally, I would like to thank my supervisor Yvonne Knospe, university lecturer at the Department of Language Studies, Umeå University for all the feedback and guidence during the work process. It has been a <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> as a supervisor. Thank you...|$|E
