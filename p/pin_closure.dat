50|$|Also {{known as}} a chain shackle, D-{{shackles}} are narrow shackles shaped like a loop of chain, usually with a pin or threaded <b>pin</b> <b>closure.</b> D-shackles are very common and most other shackle types are {{a variation of the}} D-shackle. The small loop can take high loads primarily in line. Side and racking loads may twist or bend a D-shackle.|$|E
40|$|A brief look at {{the history}} of various book {{closures}} such as metal clasps, leather or fabric ties, <b>pin</b> and hole <b>closures,</b> using examples from the collections of the Woodson Research Center, Fondren Library, Rice University.

40|$|AbstractWe use the {{recently}} developed theory of finite categories and the two-sided kernel {{to study the}} effect of the unambiguous concatenation product of recognizable languages on the syntactic monoids of the languages involved. As a result of this study we obtain an algebraic characterization (originally due to <b>Pin)</b> of the <b>closure</b> of a variety of languages under boolean operations and unambiguous concatenation, and a new proof of a theorem of Straubing characterizing the closure of a variety of languages under boolean operations and concatenation. We also note some connections {{to the study of the}} dot-depth hierarchy...|$|R
2500|$|The Porsche {{engineers}} obliged, but {{in doing}} so, caused the new brake ducts {{to interfere with}} the bodywork <b>closure</b> <b>pins,</b> which attach the bodywork to the car. Coming out of turn seven, the rear bodywork flew off the car at approximately , causing the car to become extremely unstable. The car lifted off the ground and tumbled multiple times down the track. The front of the car was completely torn away, leaving Donohue, still strapped to his safety seat, with his legs dangling outside the car. Amazingly, Donohue only suffered a broken leg. George Follmer, Donohue's old Trans-Am teammate, resumed testing the 917-10 while Donohue was recuperating. In classic Donohue style, Donohue said of Follmer testing his car: ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a detailed numerical {{study of the}} mode I interlaminar fracture of carbon/epoxy composite laminates with z-ﬁbre reinforcement. The study was performed using a double cantilever beam conﬁguration. A ﬁnite element model was developed using thick-layered shell elements to model the composite laminates and non-linear interface elements to simulate the through thickness reinforcements. An existing micro-mechanical solution was employed to model the material behaviour of the interface element. The numerical analysis showed that z-ﬁbre pinning were eﬀective in bridging delamination when damage had propagated into the z-ﬁbre ﬁeld; these <b>pins</b> provided crack <b>closure</b> forces that shielded the delamination crack from the full delaminating force and moment due to applied loads. Therefore, the z-ﬁbre technique signiﬁcantly improves the crack growth resistance and hence arrests or delays delamination extension. The numerical results were validated against experimental data. With reference to structural integrity this technique {{can be used to}} design a more damage...|$|R
5000|$|While {{there are}} reports of this type of {{instrument}} being used in humans, {{it is more likely that}} these were reserved for veterinary use, while the common thumb lancet was the instrument of choice for use in people. A survey of 100 fleams found thumb lancets in 6%. [...] These instruments with their triangular-shaped blades were designed to be placed over the vein (most commonly the jugular or saphenous) and struck with a fleam stick. This would ideally result in a rapid penetration of the vein with minimal risk to the operator and minimal dissection of the subcutaneous tissues. This latter point would have been considered important in minimizing the formation of a dissecting hematoma. Once the desired blood was drained from the patient, the operator would place a pin through the edges of the incision. A figure eight of tail hair or thread would then be placed over the <b>pin</b> to retain <b>closure.</b> Statements from Mayhew in his 1864 treatise would indicate that the perceived benefits of these procedures were coming into great question in the latter half of the 19th century for all conditions except laminitis.|$|R
40|$|Many {{energetic}} {{systems can}} be activated via mechanical means. Percussion primers in small caliber ammunition and stab detonators used in medium caliber ammunition are just two examples. Current medium caliber (20 - 60 mm) munitions are detonated {{through the use of}} impact sensitive stab detonators. Stab detonators are very sensitive and must be small, as to meet weight and size limitations. A mix of energetic powders, sensitive to mechanical stimulus, is typically used to ignite such devices. Stab detonators are mechanically activated by forcing a firing <b>pin</b> through the <b>closure</b> disc of the device and into the stab initiating mix. Rapid heating caused by mechanically driven compression and friction of the mixture results in its ignition. The rapid decomposition of these materials generates a pressure/temperature pulse that is sufficient to initiate a transfer charge, which has enough output energy to detonate the main charge. This general type of ignition mix is used in a large variety of primers, igniters, and detonators. [1] Common primer mixes, such as NOL- 130, are made up of lead styphnate (basic) 40 %, lead azide (dextrinated) 20 %, barium nitrate 20 %, antimony sulfide 15 %, and tetrazene 5 %. [1] These materials pose acute and chronic toxicity hazards during mixing of the composition and later in the item life cycle after the item has been field functioned. There is an established need to replace these mixes on toxicity, health, and environmental hazard grounds. This effort attempts to demonstrate that environmentally acceptable energetic solgel coated flash metal multilayer nanocomposites can be used to replace current impact initiated devices (IIDs), which have hazardous and toxic components. Successful completion of this project will result in IIDs that include innocuous compounds, have sufficient output energy for initiation, meet current military specifications, are small, cost competitive, and perform as well as or better than current devices. We expect flash metal multilayer and sol-gel to be generic technologies applicable {{to a wide range of}} devices, especially in small caliber ammunition and sub-munitions. We will replace the NOL- 130 mixture with a nanocomposite that consists of a mechanically robust energetic multilayer foil that has been coated with a sol-gel energetic material. The exothermic reactions are activated in this nanocomposite are the transformation of the multilayer material to its respective intermetallic alloy and the thermite reaction, which is characterized by very high temperatures, a small pressure pulse, and hot particle ejection. The proposed materials and their reaction products consist of, but are not limited to aluminum, nickel, iron, aluminum oxide, titanium, iron oxide and boron. These materials have much more desirable environmental and health characteristics than the NOL- 130 composition...|$|R
