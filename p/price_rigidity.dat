40|$|Summary. There exists an {{extensive}} literature about economies with <b>price</b> <b>rigidities,</b> where some {{constraints on the}} set of admissible price systems are exogenously given. In this paper a general equilibrium model extended by a political system is described where the <b>price</b> <b>rigidities</b> are endogenously chosen by political candidates.

Finally an example is discussed, where in equilibrium both political candidates propose <b>price</b> <b>rigidities</b> excluding the Walrasian equilibrium price system.

In France, Jean-Pascal Bénassy (1975) and Yves Younès (1975) studied macroeconomic models with fixed prices. Disequilibrium economics received greater research as mass unemployment returned to Western Europe in the 1970s. Disequilibrium economics also influenced European policy discussions, particularly in France and Belgium.

50|$|In case of {{a supply}} shock, while the {{weighted}} average inflation is at optimum levels, the inflation levels of the nations hit by such a shock may be far from optimum. In such a scenario, given that the degrees of <b>price</b> <b>rigidity</b> in all the nations are equal, the fiscal policies would achieve the dual goal of attaining optimum public spending and maintaining the natural levels of terms of trade only when the shocks hitting the nations under the union are perfectly correlated; otherwise either of the objectives is achieved {{at the cost of}} other as monetary policies fail to influence the terms of trade.|$|E
50|$|But in case {{of varying}} degrees of <b>price</b> <b>rigidities</b> amongst the nations, the terms of trade are no longer {{insulated}} from monetary policies.

5000|$|There {{is now a}} {{considerable}} amount of evidence about how long price-spells last, and it suggests that there is {{a considerable}} degree of nominal <b>price</b> <b>rigidity</b> in the [...] "complete sense" [...] of prices remaining unchanged. A price-spell is a duration during which the nominal price of a particular item remains unchanged. For some items, such as gasoline or tomatoes, prices are observed to vary frequently resulting in many short price spells. For other items, such as the cost of a bottle of champagne or the cost of a meal in a restaurant, the price might remain fixed {{for an extended period of}} time (many months or even years). One of the richest sources of information about this is the price-quote data used to construct the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The statistical agencies in many countries collect tens of thousands of price-quotes for specific items each month in order to construct the CPI index. In the early years of the 21st century, there were several major studies of nominal <b>price</b> <b>rigidity</b> in the US and Europe using the CPI price quote microdata. The following table gives nominal rigidity as reflected in the frequency of prices changing on average per month in several countries. For example, in France and the UK, each month on average, 19% of prices change (81% are unchanged), which implies that an average price spell lasts about 5.3 months (the expected duration of a price spell is equal to the reciprocal of the frequency of price change if we interpret the empirical frequency as representing the Bernoulli probability of price change generating a negative binomial distribution of durations of price-spells).|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of {{monetary}} policy on the equity premium and the cross-section of stock returns in a general equilibrium framework. Monetary policy is conducted using an interest-rate policy rule reacting to inflation and output. Product-price rigidities in the production sector generate an equity premium {{that depends on the}} policy. The model predicts that (i) industries with lower <b>price</b> <b>rigidities</b> earn higher expected returns than industries with higher <b>price</b> <b>rigidities</b> and (ii) the difference in expected returns declines with more aggressive monetary policies. We provide an explanation for these results based on countercyclical markups. Markups of industries with low <b>price</b> <b>rigidities</b> are less variable than markups of industries with high <b>price</b> <b>rigidities.</b> When the marginal utility of consumption is high, markups in industries with high rigidities increase by more than markups in industries with low rigidities. As a result, profits of industries with low rigidities are more sensitive to policy shocks, and investors require a higher compensation for holding stocks on these industries. When the response of monetary policy to inflation is more aggressive, the markup variability reduces, and the difference in expected returns between high and low rigidity industries decreases. We find empirical evidence supporting the model’s predictions...|$|R

We show that the unique equilibrium surviving D 1 is characterized by market breakdown, although trade would be mutually beneficial in some state of nature. This occurs independently of the precision of the information available to the buyer. The model thus implies that signaling through prices may exacerbate the effect of adverse selection rather than mitigate it. Under D 1, the seller would always benefit from committing to prices that do not reveal her information.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} welfare costs of <b>price</b> <b>rigidities</b> {{in a closed}} economy without labor mobility. First, in a one-sector model, I find a {{significant}} welfare cost of <b>price</b> <b>rigidities</b> under a standard Taylor rule, especially when labor is immobile. In the one-sector model, strict CPI inflation targeting is able to eliminate the welfare cost of <b>price</b> <b>rigidities,</b> with or without labor mobility. Then, I develop a vertically integrated two-sector model with nominal and real rigidities {{where there is a}} natural distinction between the rates of inflation in the final and intermediate goods sectors. In the two-sector model, the real rigidities are introduced by assuming that labor is immobile across sectors and firms. In the model, labor immobility plays an allocative role and causes large fluctuations in hours of work. This, in turn, magnifies the welfare costs of nominal rigidities. I find that the welfare costs range from 1. 62 percent to 2. 33 percent of consumption per period for different degree of <b>price</b> <b>rigidities</b> under an estimated Taylor rule over the Volcker and Greenspan years. Taking the household welfare under optimal (Ramsey) monetary policy as a benchmark, I show that an optimal modified Taylor rule with two measures of inflation is able to bring welfare closer to the benchmark value and reduces the welfare costs substantially, even if labor mobility is restricted. ...|$|R

5000|$|Sticky {{information}} models do {{not have}} nominal rigidity: firms or unions are free to choose different prices or wages for each period. It is the information that is sticky, not the prices. Thus when a firm gets lucky and can re-plan its current and future prices, it will choose a trajectory of what it believes will be the optimal prices {{now and in the}} future. In general, this will involve setting a different price every period covered by the plan. This is at odds with the empirical evidence on prices.

5000|$|Real <b>price</b> <b>rigidity</b> {{can result}} from several factors. First, firms with market power can raise their mark-ups to offset declines in {{marginal}} cost and maintain a high price. Search costs can contribute to real rigidities through [...] "thick market externalities". A thick market has many buyers and sellers, so search costs are lower. Thick markets {{can be expected to}} occur more often during booms, and they thin during downturns. If this pattern causes marginal costs to increase during recessions, thick markets can lead to real rigidities. [...] "Customer markets" [...] can also create real rigidities. In customer markets, firms take advantage of their market power and refuse to lower prices because {{they do not want to}} give customers an incentive to shop elsewhere and search for prices that are even lower. They would rather offer the customer a consistent price and have the customer consistently shop at their store. Also, customers will likely not notice a price cut as much as a price increase, giving the store less of an incentive to cut prices.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1980s the key {{concept of}} using menu costs in a {{framework}} of imperfect competition to explain price stickiness was developed.

5000|$|Oligopolies become [...] "mature" [...] {{when they}} realise they can profit {{maximise}} through joint profit maximising. As {{a result of}} operating in countries with enforced competition laws, the Oligopolists will operate under tacit collusion, being collusion through an understanding that if all the competitors in the market raise their prices, then collectively all the competitors can achieve economic profits close to a monopolist, with out evidence of breaching government market regulations. Hence, the kinked demand curve for a joint profit maximising Oligopoly industry can model the behaviours of oligopolists pricing decisions other {{than that of the}} price leader (the price leader being the firm that all other firms follow in terms of pricing decisions). This is because if a firm unilaterally raises the prices of their good/service, and other competitors do not follow then, the firm that raised their price will then lose a significant market as they face the elastic upper segment of the demand curve. As the joint profit maximising achieves greater economic profits for all the firms, there is an incentive for an individual firm to [...] "cheat" [...] by expanding output to gain greater market share and profit. In Oligopolist cheating, and the incumbent firm discovering this breach in collusion, the other firms in the market will retaliate by matching or dropping prices lower than the original drop. Hence, the market share that the firm that dropped the price gained, will have that gain minimised or eliminated. This is why on the kinked demand curve model the lower segment of the demand curve is inelastic. As a result, <b>price</b> <b>rigidity</b> prevails in such markets.|$|E
5000|$|Interdependence: The {{distinctive}} feature of an oligopoly is interdependence. Oligopolies are typically {{composed of a}} few large firms. Each firm is so large that its actions affect market conditions. Therefore, the competing firms will be aware of a firm's market actions and will respond appropriately. This means that in contemplating a market action, a firm must {{take into consideration the}} possible reactions of all competing firms and the firm's countermoves. It is very much like a game of chess, in which a player must anticipate a whole sequence of moves and countermoves in order to determine how to achieve his or her objectives; this is known as game theory. For example, an oligopoly considering a price reduction may wish to estimate the likelihood that competing firms would also lower their prices and possibly trigger a ruinous price war. Or if the firm is considering a price increase, it may want to know whether other firms will also increase prices or hold existing prices constant. This anticipation leads to <b>price</b> <b>rigidity</b> as firms will be only be willing to adjust their prices and quantity of output in accordance with a [...] "price leader" [...] in the market. This high degree of interdependence and {{need to be aware of}} what other firms are doing or might do is to be contrasted with lack of interdependence in other market structures. In a perfectly competitive (PC) market there is zero interdependence because no firm is large enough to affect market price. All firms in a PC market are price takers, as current market selling price can be followed predictably to maximize short-term profits. In a monopoly, there are no competitors to be concerned about. In a monopolistically-competitive market, each firm's effects on market conditions is so negligible as to be safely ignored by competitors.|$|E
