Bethe's graduate student Robert Marshak noted that the New York Academy of Sciences was offering a $500 prize for the best unpublished paper on the topic of solar and stellar energy. So Bethe, in need of $250 to release his mother's furniture, [...] withdrew the CNO cycle paper and sent it in to the New York Academy of Sciences. It won the prize, and Bethe gave Marshak $50 finder's fee and used $250 to release his mother's furniture. The paper was subsequently published in the Physical Review in March. It was a breakthrough in the understanding of the stars, and would win Bethe the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1967. In 2002, at age 96, Bethe sent a handwritten note to John N. Bahcall congratulating him on the use of solar neutrino observations to show that the CNO cycle accounts for about 7% of the Sun's energy; the neutrino observations had started with Raymond Davis Jr., whose experiment was based on Bahcall's calculations and encouragement, and led to Davis's receiving a share of the 2002 Nobel Prize.|$|E

40|$|I {{point out}} that all the {{arguments}} available in the literature against an astrophysical solution of the solar neutrino problem(s) do not exclude a yet not recognised class of solar models, in which an explosive energy source {{is present in the}} solar core besides the standard <b>proton-proton</b> and CNO <b>cycle.</b> It is shown from first principle physics that stars have a non-equilibrium energy source as well, arising from transient local thermonuclear runaways. I derive a model independent inequality, which shows that the problem of the missing beryllium neutrinos lies in that the SuperKamiokande contains a term arising from neutrinos of a non-pp,CNO source. Recent indications suggest strongly that this term plays a more significant role in the solar neutrino problem than neutrino oscillations. The runaways can produce high-energy electrons and high-energy axions, and may produce muon and tau neutrinos above 1011 K, and electron antineutrinos. I show that subtracting the runaway term from the SuperKamiokande results the remaining data are compatible with each other...|$|R
50|$|In the cores of lower-mass main-sequence {{stars such}} as the Sun, the {{dominant}} energy production process is the proton-proton chain reaction. This creates a helium-4 nucleus through a sequence of chain reactions that begin with the fusion of two protons to form a deuterium nucleus (one proton plus one neutron) along with an ejected positron and neutrino. In each complete fusion <b>cycle,</b> the <b>proton-proton</b> chain reaction releases about 26.2 MeV. The <b>proton-proton</b> chain reaction <b>cycle</b> is relatively insensitive to temperature; a 10% rise of temperature would increase energy production by this method by 46%, hence, this hydrogen fusion process can occur in up {{to a third of}} the star's radius and occupy half the star's mass. For stars above 35% of the Sun's mass, the energy flux toward the surface is sufficiently low and energy transfer from the core region remains by radiative heat transfer, rather than by convective heat transfer. As a result, there is little mixing of fresh hydrogen into the core or fusion products outward.|$|R
50|$|O-type main-sequence {{stars are}} fueled by nuclear fusion, as all main-sequence stars are. However, the high mass of O-type stars results in {{extremely}} high core temperatures. At these temperatures, hydrogen fusion with the CNO cycle dominates {{the production of}} the star's energy and consumes its nuclear fuel at a much higher rate than low-mass stars which fuse hydrogen predominantly with the <b>Proton-Proton</b> <b>cycle.</b> The intense amount of energy generated by O-type stars cannot be radiated out of the core efficiently enough, and consequently they experience convection in their cores. The radiative zones of O-type stars occur between the core and photosphere. This mixing of core material into the upper layers is often enhanced by fast rotation, and has a dramatic effect on the evolution of O-type stars. They start to slowly expand and show giant or supergiant characteristics while still burning hydrogen in their cores, then may remain as blue supergiants for much of the time during helium core burning.|$|E
