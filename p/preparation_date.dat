40|$|Daily field {{operations}} were simulated for 15 - 20 {{years with a}} model built using a discrete event simulation technique in order to analyse machinery performance on cereal farms as influenced by daily weather. Daily soil workability was inferred by means of moisture threshold values and simulated soil moisture contents from another model (the SOIL-model) using weather data from Malmö and Uppsala, Sweden. The simulation model for field machinery operations {{had the capacity to}} determine operation dates for sowing and harvesting for individual fields and years. The dates were utilized to estimate annual timeliness costs, their mean and variance for each of the machinery sets assessed. Using this procedure to determine timeliness costs, total machinery costs (specific machinery + labour + timeliness costs) were also estimated for varying machinery set sizes, farm sizes, number of drivers and locations. Some of the findings were: (a) within certain limits of machinery size and for a given farm, there was not only one set identified as ‘the least-cost set’ but several; (b) sets with high daily effective field capacity showed low variation in annual timeliness cost; and (c) the machinery set to be selected should be the largest one among those with similar ‘least-cost’ on account of its lower annual variation, which in turn should lead to lower risks. The simulation model for field operation was also applied to a case study where a machinery co-operative was evaluated. Machinery pooling enabled farms to reduce total costs by about 15 % and investment requirements by about 50 %. Average timeliness cost estimates were of some consideration and their annual range was large (10 - 120 EUR ha- 1), even for the machinery systems with sufficient capacity.

Pyrethrum (from the flowering plant Chrysanthemum [...] cinerariaefolium) is an economically important source of natural insecticide. Pyrethrins attack the nervous systems of all insects. A few minutes after application, the insect cannot move or fly, while female mosquitoes are inhibited from biting. The use of pyrethrum in insecticide <b>preparations</b> <b>dates</b> to about 400 BCE. Pyrethrins are biodegradable and break down easily on exposure to light.

The flowers of the plant are harvested shortly after blooming; they are either dried and powdered, or the oils within the flowers are extracted with solvents.|$|R

40|$|The {{anatomic}} dissection {{has always}} had a crucial role in teaching gross Anatomy in medical academic courses. Nowadays the easy availability of several programs of virtual dissection together with the difficulties in finding useful human bodies as well as the complicated procedures of preparation, make anatomic dissection practice barely available in our Universities. The use of dissected preparations obtained from isolated organs or well-defined anatomical regions rather than the use of whole cadavers may be useful in many instances to overcome the difficulties described above. In particular, the long-established use of formalin-fixed specimens may still represent an easy and useful support to teach gross anatomy. However, due to its toxicity and cancerogenic activity, formalin use as a fixative has been recently strongly restricted, making both dissection as well as prosection of formalin-fixed specimens difficult to be performed. The E. Morelli’s Museum, located in the C. Forlanini Hospital of Rome, contain a collection of anatomical <b>preparations</b> <b>dating</b> back to the half of past century, which represents not only a historical but also a scientific and didactic patrimony. This collection includes over one thousand of anatomical preparations, the majority of which are fixed and stored in unsealed glass vase. Furthermore, at present most preparations, many of which are of admirable workmanship, are abandoned. Therefore, on behalf of Sapienza University of Rome, during the last months we are engaged in the recovery and safeguard of these specimens. The procedures we are using include systematic cataloguing of all specimens, adding with photograph and comments as well as several recovery treatments, tailored to the singular specimen condition (change or recovery of split vases, complete or partial change of fixative fluid, improvement of the presentation of anatomical preparation, etc.). All vases were finally filled up with fixative and sealed with a synthetic resin, which polymerizes under water. This procedure of airtight closure of vases prevents any dispersion of formalin gas in the air, making anatomical preparations available for educational as well as museum purposes. Our final goal is the recovery, restoration and cataloguing of these preparations in order to reevaluate the Anatomic Museum center as the foundation of Medical school training...|$|R

Methods A convenience sample of student athletes from a large South-Eastern Australian university responded to an on-line survey. Competitive athletes (n = 46) were grouped based on self-reported use as follows: i) none used (30 %), ii) supplement only (22 %), iii) illicit only (26 %) and iv) both supplements and illicit drug use (22 %). Whereas no athlete reported doping, data provided on projected supplement-, doping- and drug use by the four user groups allowed evaluation of doping-related cognition in the context of self-reported supplement- and illicit drug taking behaviour; and comparison between these substances. Results A significantly higher prevalence estimation was found for illicit drug use and a trend towards a biased social projection emerged for supplement use. Doping estimates by user groups showed mixed results, suggesting that doping had more in common with the ergogenic nutritional supplement domain than the illicit drug domain. Conclusions Assessing the behavioural domain to which doping belongs to in athletes' mind would greatly advance doping behaviour research toward prevention and intervention. Further investigation refining the peculiarity of the mental representation of doping with a larger study sample, controlling for knowledge of doping and other factors, is warranted. </p...|$|R

40|$|Heterozygotes for Robertsonian translocations {{have usually}} a normal {{phenotype}} but show variable decrease in fertility. In humans, meiotic segregation studies {{carried out in}} male carriers reveal a majority of balanced spermatozoa.

The occurrence of the t(1; 29) translocation in several cattle breeds makes bovines an interesting animal model to study the meiotic segregation in female carrier of Robertsonian translocations. The aim of our project is thus to assess the rates of unbalanced oocytes produced by four cows and to compare these values with those obtained in bulls carriers of the same translocation. The superstimulated cows were subjected to twenty um pick up (OPU) sessions. Dual colour whole chromosome painting probes for BTA 1 and 29 were hybridized on oocytes <b>preparations.</b> To <b>date,</b> 649 oocytes have been matured in vitro and 500 successfully spread.

The proportion of balanced oocytes is lower than the average proportion of balanced spermatozoa estimated for two heterozygous bulls (97. 1 %). This difference is essentially due to a higher rate of diploid oocytes (20. 7 % vs 0. 04 % diploid spermatozoa). The origin of observed differences in the segregation profiles of the two sexes, as well as the practical implications of these results for genetic counselling and cattle breeding are discussed.
