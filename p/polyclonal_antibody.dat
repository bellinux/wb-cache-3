25|$|Prediction and {{validation}} of the immunodominant epitope/s of HSP90 beta protein has been demonstrated using sera from infertile women having anti-HSP90 autoantibodies. The decapeptide EP6 (380-389)is a major immunogenic epitope of HSP90 followed by EP1 (1-12) and EP8 (488-498). Knowledge of binding epitopes on the autoantigen is necessary to understand the subsequent pathologic events. Predicted 3D structures of these peptides demonstrated that they exist in the loop conformation, {{which is the most}} mobile part of the protein. Also, analysis of the sequences of HSP90 beta across several species reveals that EP6 peptide forms a part of a well-conserved motif. A <b>polyclonal</b> <b>antibody</b> generated to the immunodominant epitope- EP6 confirms similar biochemical and cellular immunoreactivity as seen with the patients' sera with anti-HSP90 autoantibodies. The study might generate new tools for the detection of disease-inducing epitopes and a possible therapeutic intervention.|$|E

40|$|<b>Polyclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{collected}} from the blood of animals and humans experimentally immunised or spontaneously immunised respectively can be injected into patients to protect them against pathogens, toxins, tumours etc. This approach is severely limited by the availability of human <b>polyclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> of interest.

40|$|We {{prepared}} rabbit <b>polyclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> against Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) -encoded v-cyclin (ORF 72) and {{detected the}} natural viral protein using these <b>polyclonal</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Three antigenic polypep-tides of v-cyclin were designed and synthesized. A fragment of the v-cyclin gene was cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector pEF-MCS-Flag-IRES/Puro {{to construct a}} recombinant vector, pEF v-cyclin. Then, pEF v-cyclin was transfected into 293 T and EA. hy 926 cells to obtain v-cyclin-Flag fusion proteins. Six New Zealand white rabbits were immunized with KLH-conjugated peptides to generate <b>polyclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> against v-cyclin. The <b>polyclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> were then characterized by ELISA and Western blotting assays. Finally, the polyclonal anti-bodies against v-cyclin were used to detect natural viral protein expressed in BCBL- 1, BC- 3, and JSC- 1 cells.

Whereas both mono- and <b>polyclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> induced deposits detectable by indirect immunofluorescence, electron-dense deposits were only found in glomerular capillary walls of rats injected with <b>polyclonal</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Immunoultrastructural analysis confirmed the subepithelial location of heterologous IgG: monoclonal antibodies were essentially confined to the coated pits of glomerular epithelial cells, whereas <b>polyclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> were detected in coated pits and in the subepithelial electron-dense deposits. In the face of an excess of circulating antibody, gp 330 was not detectable in the deposits, but a striking {{increase in the number of}} endoplasmic reticula positive for gp 330 was found.
