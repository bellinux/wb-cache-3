25|$|The most {{numerous}} farms {{types in}} the GTA are miscellaneous specialty farms (including horse and pony, sheep and lamb, and other livestock specialty), followed by cattle, grain and oilseed, dairy and field crop farms. Although the output of dairy production has dropped with farms from within the GTA, dairy has remained the most <b>productive</b> <b>sector</b> in the agricultural industry by annual gross farm receipts. Despite the decreased amount of farmland around the region, farm capital value increased from $5.2billion in 1996 to $6.1billion in 2001, making the average farm capital value in the GTA continued to be {{the highest in the}} province.|$|E

The growth of the University training professionals and technologists, as well as infrastructure development, were crucial for the further development of industry and trade in the Valle del Cauca.

Public investment in infrastructure reached significant levels benefiting not only the production sector but also the growing population, this made Cali and Valle del Cauca models further development across the country.|$|E

For this purpose, we develop an input- output methodology from a supply perspective. We focus on the impact of an increase in the value-added of the different <b>productive</b> <b>sectors</b> on total CO 2 emissions and we identify the <b>productive</b> <b>sectors</b> responsible for the increase in CO 2 emissions when there is an increase in the income of the economy. The approach shows the contribution of the various sectors to CO 2 emission from a production perspective and allows us to identify the sectors that deserve more consideration for mitigation policies. This analysis is complementary to the input–output analysis from a demand perspective. TheCO 2 emissions,key productive sectors,input-output analysis...|$|R

25|$|In 45.5% of Oaxaca's municipalities, the {{population}} has declined due to migration. Poverty and migration are caused mostly {{by the lack of}} economic development in the state, which leaves most of {{the population}} working in the least <b>productive</b> <b>sector.</b> This has led to wide scale migration, mostly from the rural areas, to find employment. Within Oaxaca, many people leave rural villages to work in the city of Oaxaca, the Papaloapan area and the coast. Within Mexico, many leave for Mexico City, Mexico State, Sinaloa, Baja California and Baja California Sur. Most of those leaving the state are agricultural workers. As of 2005, over 80,000 people from Oaxaca state live in some other part of Mexico. Most of those leaving Oaxaca and Mexico go to the United States. Much of the current wave of emigration began in the late 1970s, and by the 1980s Oaxaca ranked 8th {{in the number of people}} leaving for the US from Mexico. Today, that percentage has fallen to 20th. Most of those migrate to the United States, concentrated in California and Illinois. In 2007, estimates of the number of Oaxacans residing in Los Angeles, California ranged from 50,000 to 250,000.|$|E
2500|$|What {{orthodox}} Marxists traditionally {{tried to}} do, {{is to create}} concepts for a very precise standard classification schema of occupations and output-defined industrial activities, which splits the working class into productive and unproductive employees. This schematic approach to the issue was strongly influenced by the official orthodox Marxist–Leninist Material Product System (MPS) in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, Cuba and Vietnam. The MPS national accounts divide economic activity into a <b>productive</b> <b>sector</b> where tangible physical goods are produced, an unproductive sector creating services, and households. Another influence was Piero Sraffa's revival of the classical distinction between the production of [...] "basic" [...] and [...] "non-basic" [...] goods.|$|E

During a speech in Parliament criticising budget priorities, he mentioned Kilman's [...] "directive to the Public Service not to buy any new cars, and then they went and bought 25 million vatu worth of new vehicles. So who is the boss of the Public Service? Are you - the Prime Minister - not the boss?" [...] Highlighting the country's trade deficit, he added: “We see less exports and more imports. Since we joined the WTO, less exports and more imports. Local businesses are breaking down. We spend hundreds of millions of vatu in trade, but {{what do we do with}} it? We talk about more development needed in the <b>productive</b> <b>sector,</b> but kill it off". He nonetheless noted the budget safeguards on spending on education and health, and voted in favour of the budget so as not to block necessary spending on public services.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between economic performance and CO 2 emissions in Brazil, in the year 2004. The contribution of the diverse <b>productive</b> <b>sectors</b> to total emission is established, {{taking into account the}} technological structure of the economy, the interrelations among sectors, the sectoral capacity of generating value-added and the participation of final demand in the national sectors. For this purpose, an input-output model is used to analyze the impact of income generation and final demand on the emissions. This approach allows one to study the impacts caused by sectoral mitigation policies. The main results show that, both from a supply and a demand perspective, the same “key” <b>productive</b> <b>sectors</b> stand out, especially the Transport sector. ...|$|R

40|$|Productivity {{growth and}} {{structural}} change are {{generally considered to}} be important determinants of economic growth. However recent research revealed that they do not necessarily lead to higher growth and employment rates. Recent studies, drawing on data from developing countries, showed that only the “right” kind of productivity growth resulted in higher employment rates. Enterprises in Africa and Latin America caught up in matters of technology; however, this process resulted in a substitution of employment by technology. The same is true for structural change; only the “right” kind of structural change caused more growth and employment. Whereas in Asia, labour shifted from the less <b>productive</b> agricultural <b>sector</b> to more <b>productive</b> <b>sectors,</b> in Africa and Latin America, labour switched from a relatively <b>productive</b> agricultural <b>sector</b> to even less <b>productive</b> informal <b>sectors.</b> Thus, policies have to focus on promoting the “right” kind of productivity growth and structural change.
