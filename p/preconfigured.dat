This was, I believe, no more than a vivid expression of what he always maintained, that no man had attained to a full faith who did not recognize in the Scriptures a correspondency to his own nature, or see that his own powers of reason, will, and understanding were <b>preconfigured</b> to the reception of the Christian doctrines and promises.--ED.] ...|$|E

50|$|The {{advantage}} of a test fixture {{is that it allows}} for tests to be repeatable since one is always starting with the same setup every time. Test fixtures also ease test code design by allowing the developer to separate methods into different functions and reuse each function for other tests.

A disadvantage is that it could lead to duplication of test fixtures if using in-line setup.|$|R

40|$|Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) based optical {{networks}} {{are viewed as}} a promising network infrastructure {{for the next generation}} network (NGN) development. By <b>preconfiguring</b> the resources of dynamic optical networks, we can reconstruct the physical topology, thus increase the number of direct routes between potentially heavily loaded physical node pairs and optimize the performance of the optical networks. This article presents the introduction to the optical network topology pre-configuration schemes and verifies the effectiveness of the QoS (Quality of Service) routing algorithm in the pre-configured topology of GMPLS-based optical networks. Simulation results show that the implementation of the QoS routing algorithm in the pre-configured GMPLS-based optical networks is instrumental in shortening the average establishing time of the control plane whilst maintaining the low block probability...|$|R

40|$|BLUF domains are flavin-binding photoreceptors {{that can}} be {{reversibly}} switched from a dark-adapted state to a light-adapted state. Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) from a conserved tyrosine to the flavin that results in a neutral flavin semiquinone/tyrosyl radical pair constitutes the photoactivation mechanism of BLUF domains. Whereas in the dark-adapted state PCET occurs in a sequential fashion where electron transfer precedes proton transfer, in the light-adapted state the same radical pair is formed by a concerted mechanism. We propose that the altered nature of the PCET process results from a hydrogen bond switch between the flavin and its surrounding amino acids that <b>preconfigures</b> the system for proton transfer. Hence, BLUF domains represent an attractive biological model system to investigate and understand PCET in great detail. © 2011 American Chemical Society...|$|R
30|$|Ephemeral {{information}} sharing, especially photo sharing, {{which allows}} a user to share photos in an ephemeral way choosing {{to have the}} photos disappear after a preset interval, has become increasingly popular. Users can <b>preconfigure</b> an interval during which other friends can access the original or cleared versions of their shared photo. In another scenario, a user can revoke the access right of certain users to a shared photo at any time {{as he or she}} prefers. Examples of such applications include the most famous Snapchat [5], Yovo [6], Privately [7] and Dstrux [8]. However, most current solutions to ephemeral photo sharing rely on a secure server to store the original image data and to enforce the access control. It would be very useful if image file formats could incorporate the ability of dynamic access control to image data such that any device and application can easily apply it as a solution for ephemeral photo sharing.|$|R
40|$|Indexación: Revista Académica ChilenaThe {{documents}} –created within {{social sciences}} faculties– that specify {{the requirements for}} thesis proposals are aimed at legislating scientific practice by declaring what is expected from such proposals. On those documents a variable set of normative demands –that de facto work as “criterion of demarcation”– is specified. Therefore, such requirements <b>preconfigure</b> what proposals –hence, a part of scientific practice– can be, excluding their counter-normative versions, controlling {{what is likely to}} turn into a “finding” and, ultimately, constructing a given version of the world (Gilbert y Mulkay, 1984; Rorty, 2001; Woolgar, 1991). The requirements made today at most social sciences faculty centres in Chile assume that key decisions during the research process should be made within faculties and by researchers alone. Those requirements are, therefore, incompatible with participative methods such as action research and systematization of practices. Such an incompatibility derives in the shadowing and exclusion of those methods from scientific practices...|$|R

40|$|In {{artificial}} intelligence, {{knowledge is}} often {{represented as a}} set of rules to be interpreted by an expert sy stem. This rule base is garnered f rom the knowledge of a domain expert and, for a variety of reasons, may be incomplete, contradictory, or inaccurate. A sy stem using these rules is also static and unable to learn new rules or modify existing rules in the problem domain. In this paper we describe the Constrained Error Backpropagation, (CEBP), MultiLayer Perceptron, an Artificial Neural Network, (ANN), capable of performing inductive learning. We Also describe RULEX, an automated procedure for extracting accurate sy mbolic rules from the local basins of attraction produced by CEBP networks. RULEX extracts propositional if-then rules by direct interpretation of the parameters which describe the CEBP local functions thus making it very computationally efficient. We also describe how RULEX can be used to <b>preconfigure</b> the CEBP network to encapsulate existing domain knowledge. Thi [...] ...|$|R
40|$|I have {{performed}} my thesis project at ATEA in Lulea, for Coop Norrbotten. The {{purpose of this}} project was to design, implement and document a new and enhanced network solution for use in Coop Norrbotten's grocery stores, and to construct a detailed rollout guide to handle the implementation procedure. Senior consultant Leif Häggström from ATEA supervised the project. I was given two primary issues to address in the new network design; the new solution should be more secure and more scalable than the old design. With my new design I also tried to address some other issues such as efficiency, performance and resiliency. The network equipment that was initially available for the new design was: • 1 x Cisco 1811 Integrated Services Router• 1 x 3 Com 3226 L 3 access switch• 1 x HP Procurve 1800 PoE switch• 2 x Wireless Access Points from Trapeze (Juniper) During {{the course of the}} project, it was decided that the 3 Com 3226 platform should be replaced, due to its age and limited functionality. The old switch was replaced by a Cisco 2960 -S switch. During {{the first week of the}} project I gathered information about the functionality of the network equipment, and drew up a theoretical design for the new network. The second week was used for documenting the existing topology and the physical conditions for the implementation procedure. During the second week, I also started designing a Zone-Based Policy Firewall solution for the network. The third week was allocated to setting up and testing the new network model in a lab environment. At this point I also started working on the implementation guide. The beginning of the fourth week was used for further testing, this was also when the decision to replace the 3 Com switch was made. The second half of the fourth week was used to <b>preconfigure</b> the new Cisco switch and the shop's router. The implementation took place during the fifth and last week of the project. The results of the project were: the physical implementation of the new network model, and the rollout guide to handle the implementation procedure. One of the conclusions i reached after the project was finished, was that it is difficult to construct a simple and modern network solution without access to modern equipment. It is possible to construct a quasi-modern solution based on older equipment, but the solution becomes increasingly complex as the designer must find many workarounds for solving the problems caused by the older network equipment.
