The government attaches a high priority to the security and stability of Southeast Asia, and seeks to further develop relations with {{other countries in the}} region. Historically the government has tried to portray Malaysia as a progressive Islamic nation while strengthening relations with other Islamic states. A strong tenet of Malaysia's policy is national sovereignty and the right of a country to control its domestic affairs.|$|E

25|$|Yashovijaya {{left behind}} a vast body of {{literature}} that exerted a vast influence on the Jain philosophy. After Acarya Haribhadra and Acarya Hemacandra, Upadhyaya Yashovijaya is the most high-profile Jain monk. Dundas notes that Yashovijaya enjoys a near talismanic figure for the contemporary Svetambara monastic community and is identified with madhyastha or <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>neutrality.</b> Dundas further notes that Yashovijaya paints a superior picture of Jainism with his inclusivism {{and it is this}} image of Jainism that has become a dominant one today. He had an influence on Srimad Rajcandra’s book Atmasiddhi wherein, he has provided six fundamental truths on soul and liberation following Yashovijaya's Adhyatmasara. A college called Jain Yashovijaya Pathashala has been established in Varanasi in his memory, under auspices of which the sacred Jain texts are being published in a series called Jain Yashovijaya Granthamala. The Jain community of Ahmedabad has honoured him by naming one block as Yashovijaya Chowk at the Relief Road end of Ratanpol where Yashovijaya lived for many years.|$|E

Renaming this as the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> techno-economic <b>neutrality</b> would clearly demarcate its role as promoter of inter-technological competition as well as justify the necessity of grouping the three regulatory <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> technological <b>neutrality,</b> competition neutrality, and network neutrality followed by their integration into the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Reference Paper. The first part introduces the theoretical foundations to better define what it is and what it is not; the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> techno-economic <b>neutrality</b> supports neither a total state non-intervention nor a progress reduced to a technical progress. The second part describes the parameters of the unanimous definition <b>of</b> the regulatory <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> techno-economic <b>neutrality</b> for the information and communication sectors considering competition and convergence. The triplets <b>of</b> <b>neutrality</b> would offer two guaranties: a regulatory burden balanced between the different suppliers of substitutable services and the emergence of an information and communication society protective of democratic values.

Since citizens must have political knowledge, political education is necessary both in public and private schools. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> political education may be compatible with the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> political <b>neutrality</b> if pupils are encouraged both to think critically and to choose from a plurality of opinions based on their reason and conscience. As opposed to political education, education pertaining to religion should be left mainly to individual families. Even school education pertaining to basic facts about religion (let alone denominational education) will almost certainly fail to be neutral, and for this reason should be kept to a minimum. Thus religious education and political education are asymmetrical...|$|R
