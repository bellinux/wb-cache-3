5|$|Mechanical {{pest control}} {{is the use}} of {{hands-on}} techniques as well as simple equipment and devices, that provides a <b>protective</b> <b>barrier</b> between plants and insects. This is referred to as tillage {{and is one of the}} oldest methods of weed control as well as being useful for pest control; wireworms, the larvae of the common click beetle, are very destructive pests of newly ploughed grassland, and repeated cultivation exposes them to the birds and other predators that feed on them.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the bark}} {{functions}} as a <b>protective</b> <b>barrier,</b> it is itself attacked by boring insects such as beetles. These lay their eggs in crevices and the larvae chew {{their way through the}} cellulose tissues leaving a gallery of tunnels. This may allow fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the tree. Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus (Ophiostoma species) carried from one elm tree to another by various beetles. The tree reacts to the growth of the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of nourishment and dies. In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were killed by this disease.|$|E

Eventually, the Human Liberation Front's secret base is discovered in Aeropolis II tower by following the enemy supply line, along with the terrorists' intentions of using a nuclear reactor. Ishikawa informs Aramaki that {{an official of the}} Energy Ministry named Sawamura has been in contact with Zebra and is connected to Megatech Body Corporation. While conducting the raid on the enemy's base, the reactor begins to overload. In order to shut it down, squad leader Motoko Kusanagi attempts to remove the <b>protective</b> <b>barrier</b> from an access point nearby, {{as the rest of the}} team search for the other building's control room. After disarming the reactor, Kusanagi locates the leader on top of the tower. Batou and Togusa encounter obstacles that prevent them from moving to the top, leaving the Rookie as the only available member. Once he reaches the top, he engages the leader in combat and defeats him in a free fall battle off of the tower.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{membrane}} contains a lipid bilayer that encompass {{the contents of}} the nucleus. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a synthesis and transport organelle that branches into the cytoplasm in plant and animal cells. The Golgi apparatus is a series of multiple compartments where molecules are packaged for delivery to other cell components or for secretion from the cell. Vacuoles, which are found in both plant and animal cells (though much bigger in plant cells), are responsible for maintaining the shape and structure of the cell as well as storing waste products. A vesicle is a relatively small, membrane-enclosed sac that stores or transports substances. The cell membrane is a <b>protective</b> <b>barrier</b> that regulates what enters and leaves the cell. There is also an organelle known as the Spitzenkörper that is only found in fungi, and is connected with hyphal tip growth.|$|E
5|$|During {{the worst}} of the storm, 5,800people were {{evacuated}} from shoreline areas of Kauai to temporary shelters. Strong waves sank or grounded several small vessels on the southwestern coast of Kauai, with 44 of the 45 boats at Port Allen being sunk. The worst of the damage from the hurricane occurred in Poipu, where the rough surf destroyed or severely damaged several exposed luxury hotels and condominiums. Elsewhere on the island, damage was greatest in areas where there was no <b>protective</b> <b>barrier</b> reef offshore. Several small aircraft were damaged at Lihue airport from the winds, including many overturned small planes. The winds destroyed several buildings across the island, including one of Kauai's oldest churches and a warehouse. Additionally, the winds destroyed the roof of a bank. Strong winds initially left the entire island of Kauai without power. Highway 56 {{on the east side of}} the island was obstructed by fallen telephone poles, forcing residents to drive on the unpaved, red dirt cane roads usually reserved for hauling sugar cane from the fields. Rising waters washed out multiple roads near the coastline. The strong winds destroyed nearly all papaya and banyan trees on the island. The hurricane destroyed or greatly damaged 1,907 homes on the island and caused minor damage to 2,983 others, leaving one-eighth of the island's homes unlivable.|$|E

25|$|The Sundarbans is intersected by {{a complex}} network of tidal waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant {{mangrove}} forests. The interconnected network of waterways makes almost {{every corner of}} the forest accessible by boat. The area is known for the Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), as well as numerous fauna including species of birds, spotted deer, crocodiles and snakes. The fertile soils of the delta have been subject to intensive human use for centuries, and the ecoregion has been mostly converted to intensive agriculture, with few enclaves of forest remaining. The remaining forests, taken together with the Sundarbans mangroves, are important habitat for the endangered tiger. Additionally, the Sundarbans serves a crucial function as a <b>protective</b> <b>barrier</b> for the millions of inhabitants in and around Khulna and Mongla against the floods that result from the cyclones. The Sundarbans has also been enlisted among the finalists in the New7Wonders of Nature.|$|E
25|$|Israel has a {{distinctly}} Mediterranean climate, {{with the country}} located along roughly the same latitude as San Diego and the Mexico – United States border. There are two primary seasons - a hot, humid summer season running from April to October with very little precipitation and a cold, rainy winter season from late October to March. During winter, average precipitation is around 20inches (50cm) with some areas seeing as much as 35inches (90cm) annually. Some vineyards in the higher elevation regions of Golan Heights can see snow in the winter months. With a dry growing season, drip irrigation is essential to sustaining viticulture. Vineyard managers will utilize pruning and canopy management techniques to maximize shade production from the sunlight. Harvest will often take place during the cooler temperatures of night time. The dryness of the growing seasons serves a <b>protective</b> <b>barrier</b> to many grape diseases that thrive in damp weather and allows vineyard managers to control vigor and yields with by irrigation.|$|E
25|$|Various {{factors can}} affect the overall {{function}} of the biomembrane and decrease its ability {{to function as a}} <b>protective</b> <b>barrier</b> and maintained the order of the inner components. The bilayer thickness, surface charge, intermolecular forces, amphiphilic molecules, changes in free energy, alternating or spontaneous curvatures, increase or decrease in temperature, solvents, and the environment are all examples of different conditions that cause changes in biomembranes. For example, the strength of the intermolecular forces within the biomembrane are fairly strong but when lipids are extracted from biomembranes for analytical purposes there is a decrease in the constraints by the intermolecular forces against the phospholipids which may cause the lipid to undergo polymorphism as well as a temporary rearrangement of other lipids or proteins in the biomembrane. The thickness of the biomembrane determines the permeability of the membrane and ethanol, which {{can be used as a}} solvent, is able to reduce the thickness of the biomembrane which is one way this amphiphilic molecule is able to permeate through the biomembrane. There can also be free energy changes that can increase or decrease during the phase transitions of the phospholipids during polymorphism or mesmorphism which can also affect the curvature of lipids. All lipids can experience some sort of positive or negative alternating or spontaneous curvature due to variations in sizes between the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic region. Temperature changes can also lead to changes in the biomembrane.|$|E
30|$|Finally, common {{household}} adaptation measures {{should be}} valued {{according to their}} economic benefits. The reduction of costs depends {{on the type of}} adaptive measure; for example, temporary safety measures, such as door guards, reduce damage costs by 50 % (Thurston et al. 2008). However, in this study, comparable adaptation measures (e.g. <b>protective</b> <b>barriers)</b> were found to be underrepresented in their implementation.|$|R
