Tenderness was evaluated by a taste panel and also by an Alio Kramer Shear Press. The pH of each solution was determined before hard cooked eggs were placed in it and again after 3 weeks of pickling. The pH of the egg whites was determined after pickling. The pH of solutions did not influence flavor or tenderness of pickled egg whites. Total acidity of solutions starting at room temperature and at boiling temperature did not significantly influence flavor, but tenderness, as evaluated by the taste panel, was significantly increased by <b>pickling</b> in boiling <b>solutions.</b> Egg white <b>pickled</b> in boiling <b>solutions</b> had lower shear values than did whites <b>pickled</b> in <b>solutions</b> at room temperature. This suggests that the two methods of measuring egg white tenderness were not positively correlated.

Economic losses associated with a reduction in organoleptic quality of garlic (Allium sativum L.) containing blue-green pigments can be incurred. Preventing blue-green pigment formation can mitigate potential financial and brand equity damages. To prevent pigment formation, inactivation of the enzyme which yields pigment substrates is essential. Two methods to inactivate the enzyme associated with pigment formation were explored: blanch treatment of whole garlic cloves (100 °C, 5 min); and soaking of whole, non-blanched garlic cloves in low pH (< 3. 0) acetic or citric acid pickling solutions for seven days. The blanching treatment was effective in inactivating the enzyme as the pigment substrate decreased by approximately 99 % as compared with pigment substrate concentrations in non-blanched garlic cloves. Soaking whole garlic cloves in low pH (< 3. 0) pickling solutions did not result in enzyme inactivation as pigments formed in cloves soaked in the acetic acid pickling solutions; however pigments did not form in cloves soaked in the citric acid <b>pickling</b> <b>solution.</b> This {{may be due to the}} different effect mono- and poly-carboxylic acids have on the permeability of garlic cell membranes.

Hydrochloric spent <b>pickling</b> <b>solutions</b> from steel processing contain relevant amount of metals such as iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) that may significantly affect recovery of hydrochloric acid (HCl) through pyrohydrolysis. In fact, although Fe may be recovered as ferric oxide (Fe 2 O 3) and does not have a substantial effect on pyrohydrolysis process, zinc chloride (ZnCl 2) evaporating can occlude nozzles and stick to the pyrohydrolysis reactor walls, thereby contaminating the iron oxide product. Thus, efficient removal Zn is needed. Of note, Zn recovery is economically affordable and can provide commercially valuable by-products such as zinc chloride or sulfate. In this study, we present the results obtained within a laboratory experimental campaign to recover Zn and Fe from pickling liquors by means of liquid-liquid extraction adopting a suitable organic extractant, tributyl phosphate (TBP). In order to find out the best operative conditions leading to very high efficiencies, three main factors were investigated: the volume ratio between the organic extractant and the aqueous spent pickling liquor, the stirring time, and the percentage of TBP used (pure or variously diluted in kerosene).

40|$|Hydrofluoric acid is a water {{solution}} of hydrogen fluoride (HF). Hydrofluoric acid is used widely in diverse types of industrial applications; traditionally, {{it is used}} in <b>pickling</b> <b>solutions</b> in the metal industry, in the fabrication of chlorofluorocarbon compounds, as an alkylation agent for gasoline and as an etching agent in the industry of glass. In recent years, hydrofluoric acid has extensively {{been used in the}} manufacture of semiconductors and microelectronics during the wet chemical cleaning of silicon wafers. Hydrofluoric acid can be considered a reducing acid and although it is chemically classified as weaker than, for example, sulfuric or hydrochloric acids, it is extremely corrosive. This acid is also particularly toxic and poses greater health hazard than most other acids. The corrosion behavior of metals in hydrofluoric acid has not been as systematic studied in the laboratory as for other common inorganic acids. This is largely because tests using hydrofluoric acid cannot be run in standard equipment and because of the toxic nature of this acid. Moreover, short-term weight loss laboratory corrosion tests in hydrofluoric acid can be frustrating since the results are not as highly reproducible {{as in the case of}} other acids such as sulfuric or hydrochloric. One of the reasons is because hydrofluoric acid commonly attacks the coupons used for testing in a non-uniform manner. That is, the corrosive power of this acid is not aimed to uniform thinning but mostly to localized penetration below the skin of the metal in the form of thin cracks, voids, pits, trenches and sometimes intergranular attack. Figure 1 shows the cross section of a coupon of Alloy 600 (N 06600) exposed for 336 h to the vapor phase of a {{solution of}} 20 % HF at 93 C. In cases where internal penetration occurs such as in Figure 1, it may not be recommended to use corrosion rates based on weight loss for material selection...|$|R
