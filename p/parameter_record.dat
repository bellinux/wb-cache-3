2500|$|Both the CVR and FDR were {{recovered}} {{and used for}} the investigation. Due to the limited <b>parameters</b> <b>recorded</b> by the FDR, investigators did {{not have access to}} the position of the flight-control surfaces (rudder, ailerons, elevator, etc.) for the accident. However, two <b>parameters</b> <b>recorded</b> by the FDR were crucial, one being the aircraft's heading, the other being the pitch control yoke position. During the approach, Flight 427 encountered wake turbulence from Delta 1083; the FAA, however, determined [...] "the wake vortex encounter alone would not have caused the continued heading change that occurred after 1903:00." [...] The abrupt heading change shortly before the dive pointed investigators immediately to the rudder. Due to the absence of rudder pedal positions from the data, investigators had to determine whether the rudder moved hard-over by a malfunction or by pilot command. This in turn led to the CVR being more heavily scrutinized than most other recordings as statements and breathing from the pilots could potentially tell investigators if they were fighting for control over a rudder malfunction or inadvertently stomped on the wrong rudder pedal in excitement from the wake-turbulence. Boeing felt the latter more likely, while USAir and the Pilot's Union felt the former was more likely.|$|R

In the paper, a theoretical and experimental investigation on the effect of <b>recording</b> <b>parameters</b> on measurement error of global rainbow technique was carried out for the first time. The relation of the two <b>recording</b> <b>parameters,</b> and the monochromatic aberrations in global rainbow imaging system were analyzed. In the framework of Lorenz-Mie theory and modified Nussenzveig theory with correction coefficients, measurement error curves of refractive index and size of the droplets caused by aberrations for different <b>recording</b> <b>parameters</b> were simulated. The simulated results showed that measurement error increased with RMS radius of diffuse spot; a long recording distance and a large scattering angle recording range both caused a larger diffuse spot; <b>recording</b> <b>parameters</b> were indicated to have a great effect on refractive index measurement error, but have little effect on measurement of droplet size. A sharp rise in spot radius at large <b>recording</b> <b>parameters</b> was mainly due to spherical aberration and coma. To confirm some of the conclusions, an experiment was conducted. The experimental results showed that the refractive index measurement error was as high as 1. 3 x 10 (- 3) for a recording distance of 31 cm. In the case, <b>recording</b> <b>parameters</b> are suggested to be set to as small a value as possible under the same optical elements. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
