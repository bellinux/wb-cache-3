50|$|The {{introduction}} of the multi <b>port</b> <b>selector</b> valve (MSV) also facilitated the automation {{of the use of}} MPFM's, but this can also be achieved with conventional valving designs for well tests. MSV's are particularly suitable for onshore pad drilling,and where many nearby wells have similar pressures, and allow MPFM's to be shared between groups of wells.|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} {{cluster is}} a recent advance in network technology in which a group of processors have simultaneous read and write {{access to the same}} records on one or more disk drives. The mass storage is associated with all the processors on the cluster, rather than any single processor. When combined with an intelligent terminal <b>port</b> <b>selector,</b> the computer cluster offers significant advantages in a hospital environment. Further benefits accrue when there exists a need for sharing data between hospital information and scientific research applications. A description of the hardware and software elements of a computer cluster and the use of a cluster at a medical center comprised of a hospital and research institute will be presented. The advantages and limitations of this approach will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|The IDENTIFY DEVICE command {{includes}} an optional World Wide Name field containing an IEEE NAA Registered identifier in words 108 - 111. Serial Attached SCSI HBAs may {{use this to}} identify that the drive is the same even if it changes locations in the SCSI domain (the SAS address given to a drive {{is based on the}} expander phy to which it is attached). e 05178 r 0 proposes the field be upgraded to mandatory. The IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE command does not currently define that field. It would be helpful if it were optionally available, and if implemented by an ATAPI device supporting SCSI commands, matched the SCSI target device name returned in the SCSI INQUIRY command Device Identification VPD page (83 h). The other SCSI names/identifiers it could be each have problems: a) It cannot serve as the SCSI target port name, because if the SATA device is behind a SATA <b>port</b> <b>selector,</b> the same name appears in two different domains. b) It cannot serve as the SCSI target port identifier, because the value is not actually used for addressing within any domains. In SAS, the expander to which the SATA device is attached assigns it a SAS address. An advanced expander could send IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE to retrieve the World Wide Name and use that as the SAS address, but this is not required in SAS- 1. 1. c) It cannot serve as the logical unit name, because the PACKET command payload might include a SCSI- 2 compatible LOGICAL UNIT NUMBER field in the CDB (byte 1 bits 7 : 5), and each logical unit name must be unique. For IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE, the World Wide Name needs to be optional, because ATAPI DVD drives, which are the most common packet devices, have little need. ATAPI tape drives are more likely to implement it...|$|E
50|$|Introduced in 1998, {{this made}} the {{distinction}} between uplink and normal <b>ports</b> and manual <b>selector</b> switches on older hubs and switches obsolete. If {{one or both of}} two connected devices has the automatic MDI/MDI-X configuration feature, {{there is no need for}} crossover cables.|$|R
50|$|Automatic MDI/MDI-X Configuration is {{specified}} as {{an optional}} {{feature in the}} 1000BASE-T standard, meaning that straight-through cables will often work between gigabit-capable interfaces. This feature {{eliminates the need for}} crossover cables, making obsolete the uplink/normal <b>ports</b> and manual <b>selector</b> switches found on many older hubs and switches and greatly reduces installation errors.|$|R
