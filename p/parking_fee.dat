5|$|Twelve {{groups of}} farmers and fishermen, {{a total of}} 325 individuals, banded {{together}} in the Kampoeng Rawa Association on 4 August 2012. This group was tasked with managing the new tourist site, which opened, despite construction being incomplete, shortly before Eid al-Fitr (18–19 August). The site was quickly popular, receiving an average of 2,000 visitors a day during the Eid holidays, and became a common location for events held by the local government. In late August 2012, the cost of entry was Rp. 2,500 per person, with an additional <b>parking</b> <b>fee</b> of Rp. 5,000 per car, although various activities were extra. During the four-day Eid al-Fitr holiday in 2013, the attraction received over 14,000 visitors.|$|E

40|$|In {{major cities}} parking costs {{typically}} exceed automobile running costs, while {{the time to}} find a parking spot and walk to work can be comparable to driving time. Yet models of urban commuting have ignored parking completely. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine the effects of parking on morning rush hour congestion and to assess the relative merits of road tolls and <b>parking</b> <b>fees</b> as tools for congestion relief. The paper extends Vickrey's (1969) bottleneck road congestion model by assuming on-street parking is located along commuting routes radiating from the CBD. Absent pricing, drivers occupy parking spots in order of increasing distance from the CBD. Three pricing schemes are considered: 1) an optimal time-varying road toll, 2) competitively set <b>parking</b> <b>fees,</b> and 3) optimal location-dependent <b>parking</b> <b>fees.</b> The optimal road toll is shown to eliminate queueing, but does not affect the order in which parking spots are occupied. In contrast, competitive <b>parking</b> <b>fees</b> do nothing to reduce queueing, but induce drivers to park in order of decreasing distance from the CBD, so that in the aggregate commuters arrive at work closer to their preferred time. Optimal <b>parking</b> <b>fees</b> reduce queueing in addition to supporting the efficient order of parking. For reasonable parameter values competitively set <b>parking</b> <b>fees</b> are found to be relatively inefficient-indeed potentially welfare-reducing. Optimal <b>parking</b> <b>fees,</b> however, are generally superior to a road toll. In light of the logistical drawbacks of tolls and political opposition that road pricing has met, this suggests that <b>parking</b> <b>fees</b> deserve more attention than they have received in the literature. ...|$|R

25|$|On January 1, 2011, Caltrain cut 4 midday trains but {{upgraded}} 4 weekend {{trains to}} Baby Bullet {{service as a}} pilot program. This reduced its schedule from 90 to 86 trains each weekday. At the same time, it raised fares $0.25 and continued to contemplate cutting weekday service to 48 trains during commute hours only. By April 2011, Caltrain's board had approved a budget with fare increases to take effect on July 1, 2011, and no service cuts.

500|$|Construction of the Meadowbrook Causeway {{began in}} May 1933 with a $5,050,000 loan (1933 USD) given from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to the Long Island State Park Commission in April 1933. In order to repay this loan, the Long Island State Park Commission, {{working with the}} Jones Beach State Parkway Authority, would {{institute}} a 25-cent toll on the Meadowbrook and Jones Beach causeways. The 50-cent <b>parking</b> <b>fee</b> on Jones Beach would be reduced to 25 cents {{in order to keep}} the total charged to motorists at 50 cents. It was proposed that the loan would be repaid in 25 years. The Meadowbrook Causeway was designed as a [...] road from the Southern State Parkway in Freeport to Jones Beach with six bridges across channels of South Oyster Bay. Three grade-separating structures would be designed as well by the State of New York Department of Public Works and the LISPC. A trumpet interchange with the Lido Beach Loop Causeway (current-day Loop Parkway) was constructed as well. Designs also included 10.1 million cubic yards of hydraulic fill, and a new water channel for boats. Proposed completion of the project was set for January1, 1935. The road was constructed by 3,800 people and completed in October 1934, six months ahead of schedule.|$|E

2500|$|The Anacostia {{station has}} been used several times for {{experiments}} in improving Metrorail's operations. In July 1997, Anacostia was one of five Metrorail stations used to test a premium monthly <b>parking</b> <b>fee</b> which would guarantee the purchaser a spot at the station's parking garage. The $50-a-month pass {{was the most popular}} at Anacostia, and the pricing scheme was expanded throughout the Metro system in March 1998. Although Metro reserved on 15 percent of all spaces for such parking at most stations, at Anacostia this was raised to 25 percent. In March 1999, Metro tested a new emergency call box system at Anacostia and two other Metrorail stations. When Metro established a carsharing program with Flexcar in 2001, the Anacostia station was one of 12 Metrorail stations at which the system was tested. Metro also tested its [...] "Next Bus" [...] real-time information system (designed to let riders know how long they {{have to wait for the}} bus) at Anacostia and four other Metrorail stations. Technical problems and funding issues delayed implementation of the project on a wider scale. Metro relaunched the system in June 2009, and once more Metrobus [...] "Next Bus" [...] signs were activated at Anacostia and two other pilot Metrorail stations. When Metro announced a pilot program in the spring of 2006 to encourage food and other vendors to sell goods in Metrorail stations, Anacostia was one of 12 stations chosen for the test. The program stalled due to cleanliness, safety, and other concerns, but was reinvigorated in 2009, and Anacostia was one of three Metrorail stations chosen again to experiment with the initiative. When Metro adopted the SmarTrip fare care program the same year, Anacostia was one of three stations chosen to experiment with SmarTrip fare gate express lanes. The express lane program was canceled when too few riders used the express lanes. Anacostia was also one of six parking garages and lots where Metro experimented with accepting credit card payments rather than SmarTrip cards in 2007. Anacostia was also one of eight Metro stations which first sold SmarTrip cards in 2008.|$|E
