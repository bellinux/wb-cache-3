40|$|Abstract. Current <b>parametric</b> <b>CAD</b> <b>systems</b> require {{geometric}} parameters to have fixed values. Specifying fixed parameter values implicitly adds rigid {{constraints on the}} geometry, which {{have the potential to}} introduce conflicts during the design process. This paper presents a soft constraint representation scheme based on nominal interval. Interval {{geometric parameters}} capture inexactness of conceptual and embodiment design, uncertainty in detail design, as well as boundary information for design optimization. To accommodate under-constrained and over-constrained design problems, a double-loop Gauss-Seidel method is developed to solve linear constraints. A symbolic preconditioning procedure transforms nonlinear equations to separable form. Inequalities are also transformed and integrated with equalities. Nonlinear constraints can be bounded by piecewise linear enclosures and solved by linear methods iteratively. A sensitivity analysis method that differentiates active and inactive constraints is presented for design refinement. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} a {{tendency}} toward the adoption of parametric modeling capabilities has been observed in the AEC industry. These capabilities facilitate the design and enable engineers to capture design intent and reduce errors that would otherwise occur when manual changes are performed. In the modeling of large infrastructures engineers usually divide their models / projects into a set of submodels to improve access and performance. However, maintaining the consistency across these submodels is a major issue. Even though the actual <b>parametric</b> <b>CAD</b> <b>systems</b> are able to establish implicit dependencies between the operations produced in the modeling process, these dependencies are not enough when the model / project is split into several submodels. This paper introduces two novel methods, which enable automated consistency preservation across the split submodels. The first method links scalar values, used in orientation vectors or positioning coordinates, by means of global parameters. The second method links topological information a using a master/slave approach.

The profile of the ball nut is a gothic curve combined by two equal radius arcs with offset centers. Most of gothic arc ball nuts are manufactured by form grinding, where the grinding wheel is shaped into the desired profile and the tool axis is tilted at the lead angle of the ball nut thread. In case of the internal ball nut grinding the high lead angle and long thread limits the manufacturing process. To avoid the collision between the internal surface of the workpiece and outer surface of the quill the optimal tilt angle is modified. The modified tilt angle affects to {{the profile of the}} formed grinding wheel. This paper presents a method for the generation of modified grinding wheel profile independently of the tilt angle.

40|$|Data {{exchange}} between different computer-aided design (<b>CAD)</b> <b>systems</b> {{is a major}} problem inhibiting information integration in collaborative engineering environments. Existing CAD data format standards such as STEP and IGES enable geometric data exchange. However, they ignore construction history, features, constraints, and other parametric-based CAD data. As a result, they are inadequate for supporting modification, extension and other important higher-level functionality when accessing an imported CAD model from another <b>CAD</b> <b>system.</b> Achieving such higher-level functionality therefore often requires a timeconsuming, error-prone, tedious process of manually recreating the model in the target <b>CAD</b> <b>system.</b> Based on techniques adapted from programming language research, this paper presents an approach to exchanging <b>parametric</b> data between <b>CAD</b> <b>systems</b> using formally-defined conversion semantics.

But for lots of special and complicated structures of fine-blanking dies, especially some progressive dies, many problems occurred during the traditional two-dimensional design method, such as heavy workload, time-consuming, difficulty of modification, difficulty of checking interference, difficulty of novice entry. To solve these problems, a rapid <b>parametric</b> <b>CAD</b> <b>system</b> based on SolidWorks is developed for fine-blanking progressive dies in the present study. The system comprises five modules, namely DIEBASE, WORKPART, STANDARD, MOTION and DRAWING. The first three modules are designed for the rapid designing and modeling of three different sets of die components. These modules work in tandem with the design-table-based standard part libraries. The MOTION module is designed to simulate the movement situation and check the interferences of the die structure. The last module is designed for the drawing documents of the die parts and assembly. The main feature of the system is its parameter-based interfacing for fine-blanking progressive die design. The design and modification jobs could be done easily and quickly by operating this system, and the system is easy to learn for semiskilled and even unskilled engineers.

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{has become a}} state of the art analysis tool for nearly all phases of aircraft design. In contrast to CFD, computer aided design (CAD) is traditionally used in later design phases of an aircraft, when the design is almost frozen. However, with the appearance of parametric CAD systems a new design methodology was enabled, which was based on the capability of a <b>parametric</b> <b>CAD</b> <b>system</b> to replay construction sequences with varied design parameters. A parametric wing can be re-used to create a vertical tail plane or parts can be associated to other parts, which allow concurrent engineering practices. In the present study, these capabilities have been exploited to generate extremely variable aircraft CAD models ready for CFD. Furthermore, parametric construction strategies, which have been developed in the past, are applied to model the primary aircraft parts, such as wing, fuselage and nacelle and also secondary parts, such as the belly fairing, wing tips and pylon, with the CAD system CATIA V 5. For the construction of curves, which are used to create surface lofts, primarily B-splines are utilized, where the coordinates of the control points can later be used as the design parameters. Finally, the capabilities of parametric CAD are demonstrated through design variations performed for conventional configurations and through design studies with non-conventional aircraft configurations, which are in the focus of current research...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal {{of this research is}} to develop a method, from the designers point of view, for using the embodied specialized knowledge of Finite Element Analysis [FEA] software to study the behavior of materials, geometries, and configurations in order to create an iterative design feedback loop that uses structural performance as a primary evaluation criteria and point of departure for generating and refining complex formo-techtonic configurations while ensuring constructability, improved structural performance, and syntactic consistency. Syntactic consistency meaning that there would not be a loss in translation from concept to construct. Instead of the 2 -dimensional [planar] manual technology which drove modernist analysis towards the structural hyper-rationality of the trabeated system, this new process should compile and synthesize computational speed, mathematic principles, mechanical knowledge, and material logics within a digital 3 -dimensional [spatial] analytical environment in order to realize a new paradigm of constructible spatialized sensuality. The research will focus on the development of interoperability techniques and protocols between advanced <b>parametric</b> <b>CAD</b> <b>systems</b> and advanced structural analysis systems towards the creation of a fluid design + analysis process of creating and engineering complex forms and dynamic systems. Rapid prototyping will be integrated as a secondary feedback and verification loop, and as a precursor to the production of full scale construction machine readable files.

40|$|Today's {{computer}} assisted design (<b>CAD)</b> <b>systems</b> automate traditional ways of working with tracing paper and pencil, but they cannot represent the rules and relationships of a design. As hardware becomes faster and memory less expensive, more sophisticated fundamental software technologies will be adopted. This shift in the basis of CAD will provide powerful capabilities and offer new ways to think about designing. Recently parametric design, a technique for describing a large class of designs with a small description in code, has become a focus of attention in architectural computing. In <b>parametric</b> <b>CAD</b> <b>systems,</b> design features are identified and keyed {{to a number of}} input variables. Changes in the input values result in variations of the basic design. Based on conventional software technologies, parametric design has been successfully applied in many design domains including architecture and is supported by several commercial CAD packages. A weakness of parametric techniques is the need to predetermine which properties are input parameters to be varied and which are to be derived. Relational modeling is a simple and powerful extension of parametric design that overcomes this weakness. By viewing relations as reversible rather than one-way, any set of properties can be chosen as input parameters. For example, a relational model that calculates the shadow length of a given building {{can also be used to}} calculate the building height given a desired shadow length. In exercising a relational model the designer is not limited to a pre-selected set of input variables but can explore and experiment freely with changes in all parts of the model. Co is a relational modeling environment under development on the Macintosh-II computer, and Co-Draw, a prototype CAD program based on Co. Co’s relational engine and object-oriented database provide a powerful basis for modeling design relations. Co-Draw’s interactive graphics offer a flexible medium for design exploration. Co provides tools for viewing and editing design models in various representations, including spreadsheet cards, tree and graph structures, as well as plan and elevation graphics. Co’s concepts and architecture are described and the implications for design education are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Commercial pressures to reduce time-scales encourage innovation {{in the design and}} analysis cycle of gas turbine combustion systems. The migration of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) from the purview of the specialist into a routine analysis tool is crucial to achieve these reductions and forms the focus of this research. Two significant challenges were identified: reducing the time-scale for creating and solving a CFD prediction and reducing the level of expertise required to perform a prediction. The commercial pressure for the rapid production of CFD predictions, coupled with the desire to reduce the risk associated with adopting a new technology led, following a review of available techniques, to the identification of structured grids as the current optimum methodology. It was decided that the task of geometry definition would be entirely performed within commercial Computer Aided Design (<b>CAD)</b> <b>systems.</b> A critical success factor for this research was the adoption of solid models for the geometry representation. Solids ensure consistency, and accuracy, whilst eliminating the need for the designer to undertake difficult, and time consuming, geometry repair operations. The versatility of <b>parametric</b> <b>CAD</b> <b>systems</b> were investigated on the complex geometry of a combustion system and found to be useful in reducing the overhead in altering the geometry for a CFD prediction. Accurate and robust transfer between <b>CAD</b> and CFD <b>systems</b> was achieved by the use of direct translators. Restricting the geometry definition to solid models allowed a novel two stage grid generator to be developed. In stage one an initial algebraic grid is created. This reduces user interaction to a minimum, by the employment of a series of logical rules based on the solid model to fill in any missing grid boundary condition data. In stage two the quality of the grid is improved by redistributing nodes using elliptical partial differential equations. A unique approach of improving grid quality by simultaneously smoothing both internal and surface grids was implemented. The smoothing operation was responsible for quality, and therefore reduced the level of grid generation expertise required. The successful validation of this research was demonstrated using several test cases including a CFD prediction of a complete combustion system...|$|R
40|$|The {{methodology}} for a dynamic design process is loosely {{based upon the}} idea of parameters in Computer Aided Design (CAD). Parameters allow the possibility to make changes and create part families (and therefore product families) with ease, through flexibility that these parameters bring. This idea of flexibility and parameters (or indeed dynamicism) can be developed further, {{to the level of}} design methodology, an area of uncertainty within many organisations, most typically those within the Small and Medium sized Enterprises. Therefore the work will utilise a <b>parametric</b> <b>CAD</b> <b>system</b> to allow for flexibility in design, but perhaps more importantly, utilise methods in creating a more flexible design process, through a study of design methodology. These methodologies are wide in scope, including sequential, concurrent and collaborative engineering, with Computer Aided Design and Computer Aided Engineering playing important roles within all methodology types. After a critical analysis and balanced assessment of methodologies, potential benefits and weaknesses of existing design methodologies may be uncovered, providing important information for design methodology development. Once development is complete, the design methodology is integrated within the collaborating company and exercised on a number of projects, in order to address real-world problems, in turn providing valid, real-world results, enabling an understanding of the design methodology performance. An idea is built upon that within any given company there exists a number of design supports, or influences that have an important impact upon design; such an important impact in fact, that each design influence must be carefully planned and controlled in order to optimise design and the design process. Examples of these design influences are found to be quality, project management and information. A multitude of lower level activities in design are explored including design tools, Computer Aided Engineering tools and, seemingly less related areas of the business including organisational structure and strategy. It becomes apparent that controlling design and indeed, its influences, is a sizeable task. The design methodology focuses on ensuring design supports within the collaborating company are geared towards better design. One weakness found in many modern design methodologies is the lack of context in terms of the company using the design method. If organisational characteristics are forgotten in planning a design methodology, {{it is possible that the}} implementation, application, control, acceptance and results are less effective. With this in mind a deep analysis of one particular organisation and its various characteristics is made, with reference to specific projects, allowing a greater understanding of problems in design and the needs of that particular organisation. From this study, a comprehensive list of weaknesses within the design process and associated design support processes is created, with the aim of providing specific targets for the new {{methodology for}} a dynamic design process to fulfil. The design methodology is developed in order to achieve aims and objectives detailed at the earliest stages of the thesis and in addition to address weak areas in design within the context of the company in focus, alleviating problems in the company but also problems inherent within the design process itself. As a result of the information that goes before, the design methodology is split into three stages, an implementation process is defined and a substantial amount of documentation is required. The methodology focuses on various inputs, outputs, mechanisms and controls in order to create a flexible, quasi-definitive generic design methodology that seeks to improve upon communication, information flow and values within the organisation. In addition, the methodology operates on a number of levels, providing genuine information regarding low-level design activities, so often discarded by design methodologists as well as higher level, easily understood flow charts. Finally, the methodology is assessed through its use in a number of projects undertaken by the collaborating company, the feedback from which is used to make some adjustments, in turn allowing optimum design, in terms of time, quality and costs, through standard procedure. The methodology for a dynamic design process achieves success on a number of levels in real-world situations (i. e. through case studies) in terms of increasing efficiency within the design process, increasing information generation and reuse, increasing communication, allowing more informed decision making and ultimately better design. Its true value, whilst difficult to measure, may be seen on the pages that follow...|$|E
40|$|Over time, {{many studies}} about deer antlers, based on {{classical}} morphometry, have been done. The present study propose {{a new perspective}} on the study of Iberian red deer antlers (Cervus elaphus hispanicus) from Sierra Morena (Spain), introducing new techniques able to provide more detailed information about them. The objectives addressed in this work have been principally focused on the use of geometric morphometrics methods and photogrammetric systems based on CAD- 3 D technology. Three-dimensional coordinates of 217 antlers concerning both the full and half antler structure, were adapted to each objective of the study and subjected to several statistics analyses. The exhaustive characterization of the shape changes of different antler parts with age was carried out, as well as the exploration of the existence of an optimal age for the obtention of the best antlers. The antlers of youngest individuals (2 to 3 years old) showed smaller but more elongated near the skull, with straighter and vertically oriented tines; while antlers of fully-grown individuals (6 to 9 years old) were shorter near the skull and more arched distally, with longer and curved tines. The allocation of an own antler categorization, based on measures of homologation protocols, made possible the observation of an antler improvement of individuals aged between 4 - 9 years, as well as some deterioration from 10 to 13 years. This is important for deer management in the area studied, which also might be applicable to other species. The high variability of antlers in terms of asymmetry was studied through the evaluation of the presence of Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and Directional asymmetry (DA). Generally, previous studies show FA on antlers. However, the presence of FA and DA was significant in the antlers sampled, being the amount of DA higher than FA. The predominance of DA, rejected the possibility of considering FA as individual quality indicator. In addition, the DA presence involved new insights about the antler asymmetry and its development, pointing to to a more intense use of the right antler side. On the other hand, the annual capacity of antlers to regenerate, where multiple pathways interact, led us to the idea that antlers may act as modular structures. Accordingly, five modularity hypotheses of different biological interest, were proposed taking into account the variation among individuals and the variation suffered at direct developmental pathways. Modularity and integration were found, highlighting the tight relationship between both phenomena in antlers. This last fact, reflected the interaction of multiple pathways along the antler growth, as well as the existence of developmental interactions transmitting the effect of random perturbations throughout the whole structure. Thus, antlers generally act as single integrated modules, performing a common function as head and eyes protection during fights. However, the modularity observed suggested the relative independent behaviour of some antler parts, as the trez tines, during antler development. Finally, a Photogrammetric Interactive Measure Method (PhIMM), based on the combination of digital methods and the use of a <b>parametric</b> <b>CAD</b> <b>system,</b> was proposed to complete the study. This methodology, represents advantages from the data-taking point of view, since the use of digital photographs allows to sample in the field in an economic and fast way. Furthermore, the lack of taking measures in the field is not a problem, since the CAD technology allows to create three-dimensional models of the structures on which we can perform all the measurements desired, including volumes and perimeters. In addition, the information extracted from this models can be directly shown in excel sheets, facilitating the data processing and even the introduction in other programs.

En cambio, las cornamentas de especímenes de 6 - 9 años, eran más cortas y arqueadas, con puntas largas y curvadas. La categorización propia de las astas, permitió observar una mejora de la calidad de las mismas en individuos de 4 a 9 años, y un deterioro en las de 10 a 13 años. La presencia de asimetría fluctuante (FA) y asimetría direccional (DA), también fue estudiada. Tanto FA como DA fueron significativas, siendo DA más abundante que FA. La predominancia de DA, imposibilitó considerar FA como indicador de calidad individual, y sugirió un uso más intenso de la rama derecha. Que las cornamentas pudieran ser estructuras modulares, llevó a proponer cinco hipótesis de modularidad, teniendo en cuenta tanto la variación entre individuos, como la debida a vías directas del desarrollo. La presencia de modularidad e integración en las cornamentas fue significativa. Ello reflejó tanto la interacción de múltiples vías durante el proceso de crecimiento de las cornamentas, como la existencia de interacciones capaces de transmitir perturbaciones aleatorias a lo largo de toda la estructura. Por lo tanto, las astas actuarían como un único módulo integrado. Sin embargo, la modularidad observada sugirió cierta independencia de partes como los candiles. La implementación de un método fotogramétrico interactivo de medida (PhIMM), basado en la toma de fotografías digitales y la utilización de un sistema CAD paramétrico, fue propuesto para completar el estudio. Dicha metodología, es ventajosa en la recolección de datos, puesto que la tecnología digital permite muestrear rápida y económicamente. Además, la falta del registro de ciertas medidas en el campo no es un problema, ya que la tecnología CAD permite crear modelos tridimensionales de las estructuras de interés, donde es posible realizar todas las medidas deseadas...|$|E
40|$|As {{collaborative}} {{design and}} configuration design gain increasing importance in product development, it becomes essential to exchange <b>parametric</b> <b>CAD</b> models among participants. <b>Parametric</b> <b>CAD</b> models {{can be represented}} and exchanged {{in the form of}} a macro file or a part file that contains the modeling history of a product. The modeling history of a <b>parametric</b> <b>CAD</b> model contains feature specifications and each feature has selection information that records the name of the referenced topological entities. Translating this selection information requires solving the problems of how to identify the referenced topological entities of a feature (persistent naming problem) and how to convert the selection information into the format of the receiving <b>CAD</b> <b>system</b> (naming mapping problem).

40|$|AbstractIn history based <b>parametric</b> <b>CAD</b> {{modeling}} <b>systems,</b> persistent {{identification of}} the topological entities after design modification is mandatory to keep the design intent by recording model creation history and modification history. Persistent identification of geometric and topological entities is necessary in the product design phase {{as well as in}} the re-evaluation stage. For the identification, entities should be named first according to the methodology which will be applicable for all the entities unconditionally. After successive feature operations on a part body, topology based persistent identification mechanism generates ambiguity problem that usually stems from topology splitting and topology merging. Solving the ambiguity problem needs a complex method which is a combination of topology and geometry. Topology is used to assign the basic name to the entities. And geometry is used for the ambiguity solving between the entities. In the macro parametrics approach of iCAD lab of KAIST a topology based persistent identification mechanism is applied which will solve the ambiguity problem arising from topology splitting and also in case of topology merging. Here, a method is proposed where no geometry comparison is necessary for topology merging. The present research is focused on the enhancement of the persistent identification schema for the support of ambiguity problem especially of topology splitting problem and topology merging problem. It also focused on basic naming of pattern features...|$|R
