40|$|Abstract. Pictorial {{space is}} the 3 -D {{impression}} that one obtains when looking `into ' a 2 -D picture. One {{is aware of}} 3 -D `opaque ' objects. `Pictorial reliefs ' are the surfaces of such pictorial objects in `pictorial space'. Photographs (or any pictures) do in no way fully specify physical scenes. Rather, any photograph is compatible with {{an infinite number of}} possible scenes that may be called `metameric scenes'. If pictorial relief is one of these metameric scenes, the response may be considered `veridical'. The conventional usage is more restrictive and is indeed inconsistent. Thus the observer has much freedom in arriving at such a `veridical ' response. To address this ambiguity, we determined the pictorial reliefs for eight observers, six pictures, and two psychophysical methods. We used `methods of cross-sections ' to operationalise pictorial reliefs. We find that linear regression of the depths of relief at corresponding locations in the picture for different observers often lead to very low (even insignificant) R 2 s. Thus the responses are idiosyncratic to a large degree. Perhaps surprisingly, we also observed that multiple regression of depth and <b>picture</b> <b>coordinates</b> at corresponding locations often lead to very high R 2 s. Often R 2 s increased from insignificant up to almost 1. Apparently, to a large extent `depth ' is irrelevant as a psychophysical variable, {{in the sense that it}} does not uniquely account for the relation of the response to the pictorial structure.

Furthermore it is investigated to what extent inhomogeneous bark structures, for example, branch scar, blind conk etc. can be recognized and so indicate the inner wood quality of a tree. The effects of the outward wood defects are explained by means of stems which were finished to sliced veneer. The interesting parameters are, for example, the expected block-, or rather, the loglength, the ovality in different heights, {{the volume of the}} log as well brachiness, numbers and shape of the branch scars. This method of measurement hopes to contribute to the sustainability in value and enable approximate through-cut calculations of standing trees. This problem was exemplarily investigated by analyzing seven logs of the tree species European beech (Fagus sylvatica), oak (Quercus spec.) and wild cherry (Prunus avium). To detect the outward wood defects on the scanned trees the laserscans were unwound and analyzed. Firstly the trees were identified in the laserscanner data, and for every trunk, the diameters were calculated of the log ends. These diameters were averaged and yielded the diameter of the reference cylinder, which constitutes an ideal trunk. The scan coordinates were converted into <b>picture</b> <b>coordinates</b> by means of different transformation matrices. The result of this cylindrical unwinding is a 2 D-picture for every scanned tree. These pictures were applied to another analysis software, which enabled an semiautomatic wood defect detection and classification. The software works with different image algorithms as well as with a neural network, so that the recognition rate of the software can be improved by reading of training data records, and furthermore, learn from each additional picture analysis. The result of the analysis was the corresponding classification of ever...|$|E

40|$|This {{presents}} {{the response to}} questions formulated by a round table discussion panel to the NUFACT 11 participants. The main points made were as follows. Neutrino mass is physics beyond the Standard Model; it presents a very deep puzzle to solve, with the answers to several fundamental questions as potential reward. Precision measurement of oscillation parameters is one essential way to access information needed to solve this puzzle {{and there is a}} relatively clear (but not easy) way forward. Large θ 13 makes the appearance signals larger, but does not allow to relax the requirements on high beam intensity and large detector masses; it creates a difficult challenge on systematic errors, which will require dedicated ancillary experiments. Of particular interest is a low intensity muon storage ring for required cross-section measurements. There exist already extended bottom-up international collaboration in both physics and R&D experiments. All three main regions have plans for upgraded super-beams and associated detectors, with a variety of (mostly) complementary baselines, proceeding in an incremental way. The ultimate precision and verification of the neutrino mixing picture requires new types of neutrino beams based on storage rings. For low energy neutrinos, the beta-beam is a possible (but substantial) intermediate step. The Neutrino Factory offers the best precision and best sensitivity to deviations from the standard <b>picture.</b> <b>Coordinated</b> international R&D is pursued. International collaboration at the top level would be beneficial in acknowledging the process, so as make sure that intermediate steps are effectively building up in complementary fashion towards the ultimate goals...|$|R

We show that nonadiabatic effects are especially large when the Coulomb field of the ionic core is taken into account during the under-the-barrier motion.

40|$|Based on the {{consideration}} of naturalness and physical facts in Einstein's theories of relativity, a nontrivial spacetime physical picture, which has a slight difference from the standard one, is introduced by making a further distinction on the absolute background of spacetime and the relative length or duration of base units of spacetime. In this <b>picture,</b> the <b>coordinate</b> base units in gravity-induced spacetime metric are defined by the standard clock and ruler equipped by the observer, and duplicated onto the every position of the whole universe. In contrast, the local intrinsic base units of spacetime in gravitational field are defined by the length and duration of physical events intervals in the same-type standard clock and ruler which are really located at every position of the universe. In principle, the reading number of the standard clock is counted by the undergone times of unit intervals defined depending on {{a certain kind of}} local intrinsic events. But the size of the base units of spacetime is essentially depicted by the length of the line segment, which is cut from the absolute background of spacetime by the local intrinsic events of unit interval. The effect of gravitation is just to change the length of this segment for base spacetime units. On the basis of such a physical picture of spacetime, in a fairly natural way we re-derive a new classical dynamical equation which satisfies a more realistic and moderately general principle of relativity. To further examine this physical picture including of gravitation and spacetime, we also reinterpret the gravitational redshifts for solar gravity tests. Comment: 10 pages. All words "proper" (except for "proper longevity") appeared in previous versions should be more accurately understood as "local intrinsic".
