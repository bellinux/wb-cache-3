50|$|Both the Capitol and the President's House {{were burned}} during the War of 1812, {{cracking}} and pitting the sandstone, and requiring extensive repair. Both buildings were whitewashed and later painted to hide damage {{and protect the}} stone from weathering, {{and use of the}} stone <b>for</b> <b>exterior</b> <b>use</b> declined as its shortcomings became apparent. One of the last major uses of the material was at the U.S. Capitol gatehouses and gateposts, designed by Charles Bulfinch about 1827.

50|$|Adjustments to the {{manufacturing}} process can impart differences in thickness, panel size, strength, and rigidity. OSB panels have no internal gaps or voids, and are water-resistant, although they do require additional membranes to achieve impermeability to water and are not recommended <b>for</b> <b>exterior</b> <b>use.</b> The finished product has properties similar to plywood, but is uniform and cheaper. When tested to failure, OSB has a greater load-bearing capacity than milled wood panels. It has replaced plywood in many environments, especially the North American structural panel market. Unfortunately, its use as sheathing {{has contributed to the}} leaky condo crisis, as it is less able to breathe and release moisture than plywood.|$|R

The performance of the new protective systems, applied on pine wood by surface impregnation, was demonstrated through an accelerated weathering test and evaluated by contact angle, colour and gloss changes. The study showed im-provement in the hydrophobicity and photostability of the protective systems modi-fied with selected silanes.

40|$|RIM {{encapsulated}} modular {{windows are}} now being used on several vehicles and growth in their use can be predicted. Advantages in glass handling, inven-tory control, assembly and appearance propell this growth. One disadvantage that retards this growth, however, is the old problem of weatherability of urethanes, {{even if they are}} pigmented. This has necessitated the use of either an in-mold-coating or a post paint as a protective coating for the urethane, adding to the cost of the process. This paper describes a new class of stabilized RIM polyurethanes, designed to meet the automotive specifications <b>for</b> <b>exterior</b> <b>use</b> without a protective coating, particularly for use in encapsulation of glass for modular windows. The results of both accelerated and actual outdoor weathering on appearance and physical properties are detailed and a comparison of the use of these new weatherable urethanes over protective coating, either by in-mold-coating or post painting is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Four {{tropical}} woods, {{were investigated}} to compare their performance and natural resistances to artificial weathering using the diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT). The species were garapeira (Apuleia leiocarpa), itaúba (Mezilaurus itauba) and tauari (Couratari sp.), woods traditionally indicated <b>for</b> <b>exterior</b> <b>uses,</b> and marupá (Simarouba amara), {{that served as}} reference. The samples were submitted to cycles of UV radiation (350 nm) and water until 2, 000 h. The photodegradation processes of woods surfaces were accomplished monitoring {{the changes in the}} intensities associated to lignin (1508 cm- 1) and carbonyl group (1736 cm- 1) absorptions. The results have shown that lignin was the first component to be photodegradated, resulting in surfaces mainly composed by cellulose, after 2, 000 h of UV irradiation. The processes of formation and lixiviation of carbonyl compounds were different for each species. The experimental conditions used in this work were too severe to evaluate the wood density and extractives content influences during the treatment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the history and process of establishing a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) between Sandia National Laboratories and Magnavox Electronic Systems Company for the design, development, and testing of a 360 -degree scanning, imaging, intrusion detection sensor. The subject of the CRADA is the Advanced Exterior Sensor (AES). It is intended <b>for</b> <b>exterior</b> <b>use</b> at ranges from 50 to 1, 500 meters and uses a combination of three sensing technologies (infrared, visible, and radar) and a new data processing method to provide low false-alarm intrusion detection and tracking combined with immediate visual assessment. The establishment of this CRADA represents a new paradigm in the cooperation between the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the National Laboratories and Private Industry. Although a formal document has now been executed, a CRADA is, nonetheless, primarily an agreement to work with each other to achieve goals that might otherwise be unattainable...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} preliminary test results of a 360 -degree scanning, multispectral intrusion detection sensor. This moderate-resolution, panoramic imaging sensor is intended <b>for</b> <b>exterior</b> <b>use</b> at ranges from 50 to 1500 meters. This Advanced <b>Exterior</b> Sensor (AES) <b>uses</b> three sensing technologies (infrared, visible, and radar), separate track processors and sensor fusion to provide low false-alarm intrusion detection, tracking, and immediate visual assessment. The images from the infrared and visible detector sets and the radar range data are updated as the sensors rotate about once per second. The radar provides range data with one-meter resolution. This sensor has been designed for low-cost, easy use and rapid deployment to cover wide areas beyond, or in pace of, typical perimeters, and tactical applications around fixed or temporary high-value assets. A prototype AES has been developed and preliminary test results are presented. This sensor represents a growing trend to use low-cost thermal imaging sensors, combined with other devices and advanced processing, for protection of US military forces and other national assets...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Water {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of stone decay and the {{presence}} of water alone inside a stone could cause a decrease in its mechanical strength. In order to study the effect of water on the mechanical strength of stones, three Italian stones, which have historically been used for balconies, have been studied: Pietra di Luserna, Pietra Verde Argento and Pietra di Courtil. Approach: A comparison had been made between the effect of artificial ageing, by means of freeze and thaw cycles (where the increase in pores produced by iced water mechanically weakens the stone) and the effect of saturation on sound specimens subjected to flexural strength tests. Results: The results had shown that the three stones were very resistant to freeze and thaw cycles, but their mechanical strength decreases in wet condition. Conclusion/Recommendations: On the basis of the obtained results, it can be stated that mechanical strength values in wet conditions can be considered, in the planning of structural stonework <b>for</b> <b>exterior</b> <b>use.</b> As demonstration the case of a Pietra di Luserna balcony, where fault is occurred, a is reported. ...|$|R
50|$|The red seal, which {{bore the}} family crest and which {{appeared}} on all products, {{was a sign}} of quality and authenticity. Each delivery was also accompanied by a signed document on which the directions for use were printed. According to the document, eau de Cologne was not exclusively intended <b>for</b> <b>exterior</b> <b>use.</b> It was described as good for dental hygiene, efficient against bad breath and a way of avoiding infectious diseases. In August 1785, a certain Mrs Duplessis from Nogent enquired whether eau de Cologne could in any way help her paralysed husband. In his response, Johann Maria Farina (III) suggested she dampen some pieces of cloth in the perfume before applying them to her husband's aching limbs and recommended she add 50 drops of eau de Cologne to his weekly drinking water. The letter ended as follows: “At least you run no risk of harming him in any way”. However, the healing properties were removed from the instruction leaflet in 1811 and used only in advertisements. In 1803, the signature that had featured on the information leaflet was replaced by a stamp, which then made it possible to enclose a leaflet with each individual bottle.|$|R
40|$|Children can be orally {{exposed to}} {{compounds}} by chewing, sucking and ingestion of toy (parts). Only {{the fraction of}} contaminant that is released from the toy can reach the blood stream (internal exposure) and can contribute to toxicity. In present risk assessment the release of contaminants from toy is not considered, or is not determined under physiological conditions. As a consequence, the risk due to exposure to contaminants in toys can be overestimated. With an in vitro digestion model based on human physiology the amount of contaminant can be estimated that is released from toy during sucking and/or digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. The present report describes the development of three in vitro digestion models {{that are based on}} physiological conditions in children. With these models the release of contaminants from toy can be estimated for several circumstances: 1) sucking on toy, 2) sucking on toy in combination with swallowing of the toy matrix, and 3) swallow of toy matrix without a sucking phase. The digestion models are tested for lead for 4 different toy matrices (chalk <b>for</b> <b>exterior</b> <b>use,</b> chalk, finger paint, paint).
