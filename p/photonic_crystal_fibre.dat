40|$|This PhD thesis {{investigates the}} {{application}} of hollow core <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>fibre</b> for use as an optical fibre nano litre liquid sensor. The use of hollow core <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>fibre</b> for optical fibre sensing {{is influenced by the}} vast wealth of knowledge, and years of research that has been conducted for optical waveguides. Hollow core photonic crystal fibres have the potential for use as a simple, rapid and continuous sensor {{for a wide range of}} applications. In this thesis, the velocity of a liquid flowing through the core of the fibre (driven by capillary forces) is used for the determination of the viscosity of a liquid. The structure of the hollow core <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>fibre</b> is harnessed to collect Raman scatter from the sample liquid. These two methods are integrated to investigate the range of applications the hollow core <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>fibre</b> can be utilised for as an optical liquid sensor. Understanding the guidance properties of hollow core <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>fibre</b> is forefront in dynamically monitoring the liquid filling. When liquid is inserted fully or selectively to the capillaries, the propagation properties change from photonic bandgap guidance when empty, to index guidance when the core only is filled and finally to a shifted photonic bandgap effect, when the capillaries are fully filled. The alterations to the guidance are exploited for all viscosity and Raman scattering measurements. The concept of the optical fibre viscosity sensor was tested for a wide range of samples, from aqueous solutions of propan- 1 -ol to solutions of mono-saccharides in phosphate buffer saline. The samples chosen to test the concept were selected after careful consideration of the importance of the liquid in medical and industrial applications.

40|$|Silica-based <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>fibre</b> {{has proven}} highly {{successful}} for supercontinuum generation, with smooth and flat spectral power densities. However, fused silica glass suffers from strong material absorption in the mid-infrared (> 2, 500 nm), {{as well as}} ultraviolet-related optical damage (solarization), which limits performance and lifetime in the ultraviolet (< 380 nm). Supercontinuum generation in silica <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>fibre</b> is therefore only possible between these limits. A number of alternative glasses {{have been used to}} extend the mid-infrared performance, including chalcogenides, fluorides and heavy-metal oxides, but none has extended the ultraviolet performance.

We used the tailorable guidance properties of <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>fibres</b> to control and enhance nonlinear processeswith the aim of improving nonlinearity based optical sources. We utilised modern, high power, Ytterbium fibre lasers to pump either single <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>fibres</b> or a cascade of fibres with differing properties. Further extension of our control was realised with specifically tapered <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>fibres</b> which allowed for a continuous change in the fibre characteristics along their length. The majority of our work was concerned with supercontinuum generation. For continuous wave pumping we developed a statistical model {{of the distribution of}} soliton energies arising from modulational instability and used it to understand the optimum dispersion for efficient continuum expansion. A two-fold increase in spectral width was demonstrated, along with studies of the noise properties and pump bandwidth dependence of the continuum. For picosecond pumping we found that the supercontinuum bandwidth was limited by the four wave mixing phase-matching available in a single fibre. A technique to overcome this by using a cascade of fibres with different dispersion profiles was developed. Further improvement was achieved by using novel tapered PCFs to continuously extend the phase-matching. Analysis of this case showed that a key role was played by soliton trapping of dispersive waves and that our tapers strongly enhanced this effect. We demonstrated supercontinua spanning 0. 34 - 2. 4 ¹mwith an unprecedented spectral power; up to 5 mW/nm. The use of long, dispersion decreasing <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>fibres</b> enabled us to demonstrate adiabatic soliton compression at 1. 06 ¹m. From a survey of fibre structures we found that working around the second zero dispersion wavelength was optimal as this allows for decreasing dispersion without decreasing the nonlinearity. We achieved compression ratios of over 15. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|In this {{research}} photonic crystal fibres were {{developed for the}} purpose of generating coherent supercontinua. Two photonic crystal fibres were fabricated with all-normal group velocity dispersion profiles, with low dispersion at pump wavelengths 800 nm and 1064 nm. Supercontinua generated using these fibres were shown to have superior stability and coherence compared with supercontinua generated in fibres with anomalous dispersion at the pump wavelength. Using a short piece of <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>fibre</b> with all-normal group velocity dispersion, pumped at 1064 nm, a self phase modulation spectrum spanning 200 nm was generated. The supercontinuum was re-compressed using linear chirp compensation to 26 fs, which was within a factor of two of the theoretical transform limit. This demonstrates the high spectral coherence, stability, and almost-linear chirp of the supercontinuum. Simulations showed that pulse compression using a supercontinuum generated in a <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>fibre</b> with anomalous dispersion at the pump wavelength would be limited by shot-to-shot fluctuations in the spectral intensity and phase, and the nonlinear chirp. Using a longer piece of all-normal dispersion <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>fibre,</b> supercontinuum is generated by self phase modulation, and optical wave breaking. A broad flat supercontinuum spanning 700 nm, centred at 1064 nm was generated. This supercontinuum was spectrally filtered, and the pulses obtained analysed in the temporal domain. Clean, stable sub-picosecond pulses were achieved, demonstrating the applicability of such a supercontinuum as part of a compact, tunable laser source. The same experiment was carried out using a <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>fibre</b> with anomalous dispersion at the pump wavelength, resulting in pulses with a large portion of energy contained in broad shoulders, and higher order modes. Interferometric coherence measurements were carried out at 800 nm using a Ti:Sapphire laser. A supercontinuum was generated in all-normal dispersion <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>fibre</b> with low dispersion at 800 nm, spanning 400 nm. Supercontinuum pulses generated by consecutive laser pulses were brought together in time using an interferometer. The interference between consecutive pulses was viewed spectrally, and the interference fringes had high visibility across the whole supercontinuum bandwidth. This demonstrates high spectral coherence. A supercontinuum generated in <b>photonic</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>fibre</b> with anomalous dispersion at 800 nm was tested in the same way, and the interference fringes obtained had lower visibility, indicating low spectral coherence. The research presented demonstrates that photonic crystal fibres with all-normal dispersion profiles can be used to generate supercontinua with high coherence and intensity stability. This type of supercontinuum is applicable to ultra-short pulse compression, and can be spectrally filtered to create a broadband tunable ultra-short laser source.
