The aim of this thesis is to find the gender <b>prejudices</b> <b>and</b> the stereotypes in the MEN/ WOMEN magazine, the WOMEN part, column Topic for 2011 which consisted of ten editions of this magazine. The thesis is based on the theoretical knowledge and it tries to interpret the analyzed gender <b>prejudices</b> <b>and</b> the stereotypes. The theoretical part serves for better comprehension as it focuses on the definition of the term gender, as well as gender <b>and</b> its associated <b>prejudices</b> <b>and</b> stereotypes and the media themselves as the magazine analyzed is part of them. To achieve the objective, a method of a quantitative content analysis was used. The data from the research are processed into individual tables...|$|R

40|$|Thesis {{concerns}} {{with the point}} of protection of those using institutions for dangerous youth against <b>prejudices</b> <b>and</b> negative rating. The protection against <b>prejudices</b> <b>and</b> negative rating {{is one of the}} criterions of quality standards of social services in the Czech Republic but also a criterion of the quality measure rating at the same time. This criterion will be probably removed from the czech legislation, therefore the thesis focused on consequences of this change. The first chapter is applied to the protection against <b>prejudices</b> <b>and</b> negative rating {{from the point of view}} of the czech legislation. It also describes issue of <b>prejudices</b> <b>and</b> negative rating from the point of view of various scientific disciplines which corncerning with this subject. The second chapter provides a comprehensive overview of activities of institutions for dangerous youth in the Czech Republic. The third chapter reflects request for the protection of those using institutios for dangerous youth against <b>prejudices</b> <b>and</b> negative rating in those institutions. On the basis of this reflection, the point of the mentioned request is set from the point of view of ethics and legal system. Practical issues and factor, entering into this field, are took into consideration in that part too. The protection against <b>prejudices</b> <b>and</b> negative rating is ethically substantiated, but it isn't a good tool for the quality rating of the service, because on its basis, it isn't possible to judge if the service quality is fulfilled or not. The design of the request is in breach of two sections of law about social services. The protection against <b>prejudices</b> <b>and</b> negative rating is closely connected with othe documents concerning with the human rights which have to be fulfilled by the institutions for dangerous youth. It follows that if the request will be removed from the social services standards, it won't disappear completely. The protection against <b>prejudices</b> <b>and</b> negative rating would remain in the awareness of the institution staff, but it is misleading to judge service quality on the basis of the protection...|$|R

English Jews were subject to considerable religious <b>prejudice</b> <b>and</b> primarily worked from towns and cities in which there was a local royal castle that could provide them with protection in the event of attacks from the majority Christian population. Royal protection was usually granted as the Norman and Angevin kings had determined that Jewish property and debts owed to Jews ultimately belonged to the crown, reverting to the king on a Jew's death.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to similar measures passed in Milwaukee and Chicago, the Minneapolis Fair Employment ordinance gave the city's newly created Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC) authority {{to not only}} impose fines, but also prison sentences for employers who enacted job discrimination. Larger banks and department stores saw the value in civil rights and began to hire more African-Americans. Humphrey also recognized that city police officers operating under racial and ethnic prejudice were causing urban unrest, so he instructed the city's police chief to have officers in minority neighborhoods keep in contact with clergy, teachers, business owners, and other neighborhood leaders.

5|$|Portrayals of lesbians in {{the media}} suggest that society at large has been {{simultaneously}} intrigued and threatened by women who challenge feminine gender roles, and fascinated and appalled with women who are romantically involved with other women. Women who adopt a lesbian identity share experiences that form an outlook similar to an ethnic identity: as homosexuals, they are unified by the heterosexist discrimination and potential rejection they face from their families, friends, and others {{as a result of}} homophobia. As women, they face concerns separate from men. Lesbians may encounter distinct physical or mental health concerns arising from discrimination, <b>prejudice,</b> <b>and</b> minority stress.

5|$|Representative {{of the new}} {{historical}} perspective is the 2003 biography by Pauline Croft. Reviewer John Cramsie summarises her findings:Croft's overall assessment of James is appropriately mixed. She recognises his good intentions in matters like Anglo-Scottish union, his openness to different points of view, and his agenda of a peaceful foreign policy within his kingdoms' financial means. His actions moderated frictions between his diverse peoples. Yet he also created new ones, particularly by supporting colonisation that polarised the crown's interest groups in Ireland, obtaining insufficient political benefit with his open-handed patronage, an unfortunate {{lack of attention to}} the image of monarchy (particularly after the image-obsessed regime of Elizabeth), pursuing a pro-Spanish foreign policy that fired religious <b>prejudice</b> <b>and</b> opened the door for Arminians within the English church, and enforcing unpalatable religious changes on the Scottish Kirk. Many of these criticisms are framed within a longer view of James' reigns, including the legacy – now understood to be more troubled – which he left Charles I.|$|E
5|$|Austen's novels have {{resulted}} in sequels, prequels and adaptations of almost every type, from soft-core pornography to fantasy. From the 19th century, her family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels, and by 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations. The first dramatic adaptation of Austen was published in 1895, Rosina Filippi's Duologues and Scenes from the Novels of Jane Austen: Arranged and Adapted for Drawing-Room Performance, and Filippi was also responsible for the first professional stage adaptation, The Bennets (1901). The first film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of Pride and Prejudice starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. BBC television dramatisations since the 1970s have attempted to adhere meticulously to Austen's plots, characterisations and settings. The British critic Robert Irvine noted that in American film adaptations of Austen's novels, starting with the 1940 version of Pride and <b>Prejudice</b> <b>and</b> continuing on to today, class is subtly downplayed as the United States is officially an egalitarian nation where all people are equal and the society of Regency England depicted by Austen that is grounded in a hierarchy based upon the ownership of land and the antiquity of the family name is one that Americans cannot embrace in its entirety.|$|E
30|$|<b>Prejudices,</b> {{stereotypes}} <b>and</b> discriminatory tendencies {{are often}} built between ethnic groups {{that relate to}} each other as autochthons and strangers (Lentz and Nugent 2000). Ethnicity is a very strong tool for political and social exclusion of other groups (Schlee 2008). It often comes together with ethnocentrism which includes judgments of others’ cultural values and a feeling of superiority over others. Ethnocentrism is coupled to <b>prejudice,</b> exclusion <b>and</b> discrimination and is used to organize the repression or domination of one group by another (Healey 2014). Thus, there are interlocking relations between <b>prejudices</b> <b>and</b> stereotypes and exclusion.|$|R
