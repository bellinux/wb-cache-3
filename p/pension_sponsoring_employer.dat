40|$|Why are {{pension plans}} not {{designed}} {{in the same way}} as commercial aircraft? At first blush, this question might seem a strange one to ask. It is also, however, an instructive one, and many similarities exist between the two things. Given the astounding success of aircraft design over the last century, we show that designers of pension plans have much to learn from aircraft designers. This article spells out these lessons by using the framework of designing a commercial aircraft to illustrate how a personal defined-contribution (DC) pension plan should be designed if it is to achieve its objective of delivering an adequate and secure pension to the retired pension plan member. Understanding the process of designing an aircraft can greatly enhance one’s understanding of how an optimal DC pension plan might be designed and can considerably simplify the task of the <b>pension</b> plan trustees, <b>sponsoring</b> <b>employers,</b> and regulators who oversee personal DC pension plans...|$|R
30|$|The Skill Stream of the Migration Programme is {{predominantly}} comprised of two visa categories which are distinguished by whether an applicant {{is sponsored by}} an Australian <b>employer.</b> <b>Employer</b> <b>Sponsored</b> visa applicants require a nomination from a <b>sponsoring</b> <b>employer.</b> <b>Sponsoring</b> <b>employers</b> are required to offer a skilled position in the applicant’s field that is full time and ongoing {{for a period of}} at least two years. The position must pay a market salary rate, and the employer is subject to monitoring by the Department of Immigration for a period of up to five years after they cease to be a <b>sponsor.</b> Furthermore, <b>Employer</b> <b>Sponsored</b> migrants must meet minimum skill, qualification, experience, and language requirements.|$|R

50|$|For both LMS and {{segmented}} multi-employer schemes the {{insolvency risk}} is calculated as the weighted average probability of insolvency for all participating <b>sponsoring</b> <b>employers,</b> {{but in the}} case of an LMS arrangement, these probabilities are adjusted by a scaling factor (< 1) to reflect the degree of correlation across the employers in the scheme. The PPF defines an associated pension scheme as one that has more than one <b>sponsoring</b> <b>employer</b> and where the <b>sponsoring</b> <b>employers</b> are financially dependent or linked to the same parent company. For associated schemes the scaling factor was 0.9 up to the 2014/15 levy year (the factor going forwards is still to be confirmed by the PPF) whilst for non-associated schemes the scaling factor is the ratio between members of the largest employer and the total number of members for the entire scheme.|$|R

40|$|Corporate {{pension funding}} policy can be {{considered}} as put options written on the asset of the pension plan with a strike price equal to the value of pension liabilities. This implies that <b>pension</b> <b>sponsors</b> should allocate their asset to minimize the sum of the option premiums such that pension asset is the budget constraint to pension resources. In this paper, valuation model for corporate pension funds is constructed. We can take in valuable information to evaluate pension funds by using suggested model in this paper such as the funding ratio, the volatility of investment and the aging of participants. The results of this study support former ones and shed light on the longevity risk for <b>pension</b> <b>sponsors</b> in addition. It is not only useful for pension management but also some practical issues such as pension buyout...|$|R

40|$|Even risky <b>pension</b> <b>sponsors</b> {{could offer}} {{essentially}} riskless pension promises by contributing a sufficient level {{of resources to}} their pension trust funds and by investing those resources in fixed-income securities designed to deliver their payoffs just as pension obligations are coming due. However, almost no firm has chosen to fund its plan in this manner. We study the optimal funding choice for plan sponsors by developing a simple model of pension financing in which the total compensation offered to workers must clear the labor market. We find that if workers understand the implications of pension risk, they will demand greater compensation for riskier pension promises than for safer ones, all else equal. Indeed, in our model, <b>pension</b> <b>sponsors</b> maximize their value by making their pension promises free of risk. We close by positing some explanations for why no real-world firm follows the prescription of our model. ...|$|R
30|$|As noted previously, {{approximately}} {{one in every}} four visas issued through GSM and <b>Employer</b> <b>Sponsored</b> categories was re-allocated from the GSM to the <b>Employer</b> <b>Sponsored</b> category between 2005 and 2009. Furthermore, the employment rate observed for GSMs in 2005 is approximately 0.8, whereas for <b>Employer</b> <b>Sponsored</b> migrants it is close to 1.0. Hence, all else being equal, the shift in weight toward demand-driven <b>Employer</b> <b>Sponsored</b> visas should have increased employment rates by around 5 percentage points (= 0.2 × 0.25). As the treatment effects calculated for GSMs are significantly greater than 5 percentage points, augmenting the regression sample to include <b>Employer</b> <b>Sponsored</b> migrants dampens {{the magnitude of the}} estimated treatment effects.|$|R

30|$|In {{contrast}} to the statistics reported for GSMs, {{there is evidence of}} a slight decline in employment outcomes amongst <b>Employer</b> <b>Sponsored</b> migrants between 2005 and 2009 / 10. This deterioration {{can be attributed to the}} fact that 99 % of <b>Employer</b> <b>Sponsored</b> migrants reported being employed in 2005, leaving almost no margin for improvement in later years. The same, however, cannot be said for the distribution of occupations amongst <b>Employer</b> <b>Sponsored</b> migrants in paid employment, which also displays some deterioration between 2005 and 2009 / 10. The proportion of <b>Employer</b> <b>Sponsored</b> migrants employed in technical, trades, and personal occupations rises by approximately the same margin as the proportion employed as managers and professionals falls; and there is a similar re-weighting of <b>Employer</b> <b>Sponsored</b> migrants from clerical, administration, and sales occupations to machine operators and labourers. A consequence of these respective shifts is that the disparities between the employment outcomes reported for GSM and <b>Employer</b> <b>Sponsored</b> migrants generally fell between 2005 and 2009 / 10.|$|R

30|$|When {{these reforms}} were implemented, {{it was unclear}} what effects they would have.

But what would the scale of the associated effects be? Would promoting <b>Employer</b> <b>Sponsored</b> migrants result in a deterioration in the occupational distribution of the jobs held by these migrants? How would tightening language and experience requirements affect employment outcomes amongst individuals entering through the points-based system?

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} theoretically and empirically {{the governance}} of pension funds in Brazil. It first demonstrates that the law allows <b>sponsors</b> (<b>employers)</b> to write contracts (by-laws) governing {{the relationships between the}} sponsors, the managers and the participants (employees) of the pension funds. It also explains that, from an agency theory perspective, this legal framework favors non-optimal governance structures, since sponsors do not bear the financial consequences of the contracts they create. As predicted, the empirical evidence reported in this thesis shows that sponsors use this authority to create contracts that minimize monitoring and maximize control over business decisions to the greatest extent permitted by law. For instance, the findings show that, in writing the by-laws of <b>pension</b> funds, <b>sponsors</b> reduce the functions of management bodies in which participants have seats. Moreover, there is evidence that the by-laws contain extra requirements for the members of administrative bodies {{in order to ensure that}} the individuals elected to these bodies have a contractual or fiduciary relationship with the sponsor, and therefore, are within the sponsor’s sphere of influence. The paper concludes by identifying some of the areas in which empirical assessment is necessary for the recommendation of reforms in the complementary social security system in Brazil...|$|R

40|$|We {{model the}} asset {{allocation}} decision of a defined benefit pension fund using a stochastic dynamic programming approach. Our model recognizes {{the fact that}} asset allocation decisions are made by trustees who are mandated {{to act in the}} best interests of beneficiaries - not by <b>sponsoring</b> <b>employers</b> - and that trustees face payoffs that are linked in an indirect way to the value of the underlying assets. This is because of the presence of pension insurance - which may cover a portion of deficits in the event of a sponsor default - and a <b>sponsoring</b> <b>employer</b> who may make good any shortfall in assets, and who may reclaim some pension surplus. Our model includes an allowance for uncertainty both of the future value of assets (because of uncertain investment returns) and liabilities (because of uncertainty in future longevity and in future interest rates). We find that we are able to substantially replicate observed DB pension asset allocations in the UK and conclude that institutional details - in particular asymmetries in payoffs to pension trustees - are crucial in understanding pension asset allocation. longevity; pensions; portfolio allocation...|$|R
30|$|However, our {{finding of}} a smaller {{improvement}} {{in the rate of}} employment as managers or professions amongst GSM and <b>Employer</b> <b>Sponsored</b> migrants as a group suggests that some migrants with weaker labour market skills may have applied for entry to Australia through the <b>Employer</b> <b>Sponsored</b> rather than the GSM category {{as a result of the}} shift in policy. Seen from this perspective, Australia’s hybrid system of skilled migration can be understood as selecting the strongest candidates for independent skilled migration and requiring weaker candidates to find a <b>sponsoring</b> <b>employer</b> as a pre-condition for the granting of a permanent visa. 14 Our estimates suggest that this approach to policy has helped to improve significantly the short-run employment outcomes of skilled migrants. Of course, the influence on the Australian economy of the aggregate scale of the skilled migrant intake is a more complex question that our analysis does not touch upon and which remains for further research.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I will {{introduce}} several new mechanisms of risk sharing regarding occupational retirement provisions, {{based on the}} analysis of present risk sharing between <b>sponsoring</b> <b>employers</b> and plan participants, individual participants and participants as a group, active members and beneficiaries (including deferred members), etc. Among others, I {{will introduce}} "Ring-fenced" DB (RfDB) plans, which introduce "share" structure into contributions and reserves, prohibit "lending" from active members to beneficiaries when the plan is in an underfunded status (actuarial deficiency), and allow temporary benefit reductions within prescribed ranges according to the funding level. The risk active members bear will be eased in RfDB plans, and market interest risk <b>sponsoring</b> <b>employers</b> bear will also be eased, because some portion of benefits becomes conditional. RfDB plans allow investments with greater risk tolerance, which may benefit both labor and management from a long-term perspective. It will also be possible to ease funding rules substantially for RfDB plans. It is said that DB plans {{are on the verge}} of extinction mainly by the threats from accounting standards.

40|$|The {{past few}} decades have seen amajor shift from {{centralized}} to decentralized investment management by <b>pension</b> fund <b>sponsors,</b> despite the increased coordination problems that this brings. Using a unique, proprietary dataset of <b>pension</b> <b>sponsors</b> and managers, we identify two secular decentralization trends: sponsors switched (i) from generalist (balanced) to specialist managers across asset classes and (ii) from single to multiple competing managers within each asset class. We study the effect of decentralization on the risk and performance of pension funds, and find evidence supporting some predictions of recent theory on this subject. Specifically, the switch from balanced to specialist managers is motivated by the superior performance of specialists, and the switch from single to multiple managers is driven by sponsors properly anticipating diseconomies-of-scale within an asset class (as funds grow larger) and adding managers with different strategies before performance deteriorates. Indeed, we find that sponsors benefit from alpha diversification when employing multiple fund managers. Interestingly, competition between multiple specialist managers also improves performance, after controlling for size of assets and fund management company-level skill effects. We also study changes in risk-taking when moving to decentralized management. Here, we find that sponsors appear to anticipate the difficulty of coordinating multiple managers by allocating reduced risk budgets to each manager, as predicted by recent theory, which helps {{to compensate for the}} suboptimal diversification that results through an improved Sharpe ratio. Overall, our results indicate that <b>pension</b> fund <b>sponsors,</b> at least on average, rationally choose their delegation structures. ...|$|R
