25|$|A Special Edition DVD was {{released}} in October 2012, featuring much improved picture restoration, especially of episodes two and three. The quality of the NTSC material was improved by combining colour from the Reverse Standards Conversion with geometrically-corrected <b>picture</b> <b>information</b> from the remastered black and white film recordings, and then applying VidFIRE to restore the smooth 'video look'. The Special Edition adds various new 'extras', including the complete, unedited version of the surviving studio recording.|$|E
25|$|A {{few years}} later, Philips {{decided to give}} CDs the ability to produce video, just like its Laserdisc counterpart. This led to the {{creation}} of CD Video (CD-V) in 1987. However, the disc's small size significantly impeded the ability to store analog video; thus only 5 minutes of <b>picture</b> <b>information</b> could fit on the disc's surface (despite the fact that the audio was digital). Therefore, CD-V distribution was limited to featuring music videos.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of the Ceefax and ORACLE systems and their successors in the UK, the {{teletext}} signal is transmitted as part of the ordinary analogue TV signal but concealed from view in the Vertical Blanking Interval (VBI) television lines which do not carry <b>picture</b> <b>information.</b> The teletext signal is digitally coded as 45-byte packets, so the resulting rate is 7,175 bits per second per used lines (41 7-bit 'bytes' per line, on each of 25 frames per second).|$|E

25|$|Displays for a {{small number}} of {{individual}} digits or fixed symbols (as in digital watches and pocket calculators) can be implemented with independent electrodes for each segment. In contrast, full alphanumeric or variable graphics displays are usually implemented with pixels arranged as a matrix consisting of electrically connected rows {{on one side of the}} LC layer and columns on the other side, which makes it possible to address each pixel at the intersections. The general method of matrix addressing consists of sequentially addressing one side of the matrix, for example by selecting the rows one-by-one and applying the <b>picture</b> <b>information</b> on the other side at the columns row-by-row. For details on the various matrix addressing schemes see passive-matrix and active-matrix addressed LCDs.|$|E
2500|$|Bistable LCDs do {{not require}} {{continuous}} refreshing. Rewriting is only required for <b>picture</b> <b>information</b> changes. In 1984 HA van Sprang and AJSM de Vaan invented an STN type display that could be operated in a bistable mode, enabling extreme high resolution images up to 4000 lines or more using only low voltages. Since a pixel however may be either in an on-state or in an off state at the moment new information needs to be written to that particular pixel, the addressing method of these bistable displays is rather complex, reason why these displays did not {{made it to the}} market. That changed when in the 2010 [...] "zero-power" [...] (bistable) LCDs became available. Potentially, passive-matrix addressing can be used with devices if their write/erase characteristics are suitable, which was the case for ebooks showing still pictures only. After a page is written to the display, the display may be cut from the power while that information remains readable. This has the advantage that such ebooks may be operated long time on just a small battery only. High-resolution color displays, such as modern LCD computer monitors and televisions, use an active-matrix structure. A matrix of thin-film transistors (TFTs) is added to the electrodes in contact with the LC layer. Each pixel has its own dedicated transistor, allowing each column line to access one pixel. When a row line is selected, all of the column lines are connected to a row of pixels and voltages corresponding to the <b>picture</b> <b>information</b> are driven onto all of the column lines. The row line is then deactivated and the next row line is selected. All of the row lines are selected in sequence during a refresh operation. Active-matrix addressed displays look brighter and sharper than passive-matrix addressed displays of the same size, and generally have quicker response times, producing much better images.|$|E
