5|$|The {{government}} {{refused to}} do anything about those servicemen who had been rejected by the courts prior to Denning's judgment, which provoked <b>public</b> <b>outcry</b> under the slogan 'Fit for Service, Fit for Pension'. The British Legion chose 73 cases and asked Denning to let the Legion present them while the courts were not sitting; Denning heard all 73 cases on 11 July 1946.|$|E
5|$|After Gandhi {{returned}} from Second Round Table conference, {{he started a}} new satyagraha. He was arrested and imprisoned at the Yerwada Jail, Pune. While he was in prison, the British government enacted a new law that granted untouchables a separate electorate. It {{came to be known}} as the Communal Award. In protest, Gandhi started fast-unto-death, while he was held in prison. The resulting <b>public</b> <b>outcry</b> forced the government, in consultations with Ambedkar, to replace the Communal Award with a compromise Poona Pact.|$|E
5|$|After Kerr {{resigned}} as Governor-General, he still sought a government position, reasoning {{that it had}} been his intent to remain for ten years as Governor-General. However, Fraser's attempt to appoint Kerr as ambassador to UNESCO (a position later held by Whitlam) provoked such <b>public</b> <b>outcry</b> that the nomination was withdrawn. The Kerrs spent the next several years living in Europe, and when he died in Australia in 1991, his death was not announced until after he was buried.|$|E
50|$|The Renco Group {{also owns}} various mills and mines in the United States and South America, and {{pollution}} problems {{at some of}} the company's properties have sparked <b>public</b> <b>outcries,</b> environmental lawsuits, and {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} in environmental penalties and fines.|$|R

5|$|Between 22 October and 24 October 2000, {{approximately}} 600 Brumbies {{were shot}} in the Guy Fawkes River National Park by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. As {{a result of the}} <b>public</b> <b>outcry</b> that followed the NSW Government established a Steering Committee to investigate alternative methods of control. Since the campaign began to remove horses from the national park, over 400 have been passively trapped and taken from the Park, and 200 of these have been re-homed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, traffic {{congestion}} had reached such a level that the use of the square as a modern wholesale distribution market was becoming untenable, and significant redevelopment was planned. Following a <b>public</b> <b>outcry,</b> buildings around the square were protected in 1973, preventing redevelopment. The following year the market moved to a new site in south-west London. The square languished until its central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent months}} {{we have seen}} a number of <b>public</b> <b>outcries</b> over controversies in which those within an {{organisation}} knew about malpractice but could not or would not speak up. However Cathy James argues that calls for greater accountability are unlikely to lead anywhere unless they are combined with an increased awareness of the structural and cultural obstacles to whistleblowing...|$|R
5000|$|... 1932: Tod Browning's Pre-Code-era film Freaks {{tells the}} story of a {{traveling}} freakshow. The use of real freaks in the film provoked <b>public</b> <b>outcries,</b> and the film was relegated to obscurity until its re-release at the 1962 Cannes Film Festival. Two stars of the film were Daisy and Violet Hilton: conjoined sisters who had been raised being exhibited in freak shows.|$|R
2500|$|From 1978 to September 1980, nearly 23,000 illegal {{immigrants}} from Mainland China entered Hong Kong. The government abolished the [...] "touch-base" [...] policy on 23 October 1980. After this date, any {{illegal immigrants}} captured {{would be sent}} back to their originating countries immediately. There were <b>public</b> <b>outcries</b> in the early 1980s over decreasing wages due to the large influx of mainland immigrants raising supply against demand.|$|R
5|$|The {{continued}} growth of long-distance railway traffic {{led to a}} major expansion along the station's west side starting in 1887. The work involved rerouting Cardington Street over a burial ground; to avoid <b>public</b> <b>outcry,</b> the graves were re-interred at St Pancras Cemetery. Two extra platforms (Nos.4–5) opened in 1891, and four further departure platforms (now Nos.12–15) opened on 1 July 1892, bringing the total to fifteen, along with a separate booking office on Drummond Street.|$|E
5|$|The <b>public</b> <b>outcry,</b> {{anticipated}} by the {{consultancy report}} for the Antiquities and Monuments Office, was to become reality.

5|$|The {{resistance}} {{was responsible for}} the assassination of Robert Holzinger, the head of the deportation program, in 1942. Holzinger, an active collaborator, was an Austrian Jew selected by the Germans for the role. The assassination led to a change in leadership of the AJB. Five Jewish leaders, including the head of the AJB, were arrested and interned in Breendonk, but were released after <b>public</b> <b>outcry.</b> A sixth was deported directly to Auschwitz.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to <b>public</b> <b>outcries</b> {{to reduce the}} amount of pollutants generated by his packing plants, Swift sought innovative ways to use previously discarded portions of the animals his company butchered. This practice led to the wide scale commercial production of such diverse products as oleomargarine, soap, glue, fertilizer, hairbrushes, buttons, knife handles, and pharmaceutical preparations such as pepsin and insulin. Low-grade meats were canned in products like pork and beans.|$|R
5000|$|There {{have been}} <b>public</b> <b>outcries</b> over their proposals. They {{chose not to}} build a course in the Bidjigal Reserve, and met some {{opposition}} to their plans to expand in Moel Famau.

In the United States, a Go Ape ropes course proposal was declined after a large neighborhood outcry in Lincoln Park.|$|R
40|$|The year 2011 {{began with}} a series of {{unprecedented}} democratic reform movements across much of the Middle East, as people called for the overthrow of regimes which had for decades curtailed their civil liberties as well as economic opportunities. The <b>public</b> <b>outcries</b> for democracy have largely, if not completely, involved Muslim populations, and the style of democratic reforms called for is anchored within distinct social and cultural contexts. In a February 9 th Op-Ed piece to th...|$|R
5|$|There was a {{tremendous}} <b>public</b> <b>outcry</b> when Ward was found not guilty. Newspapers across the nation condemned the verdict and Crittenden {{for his role in}} securing it. Only Prentice, in the Courier-Journal, defended Crittenden and the Ward family. Several public meetings passed resolutions calling for Crittenden's resignation from the Senate. After one such meeting, a mob gathered and Crittenden, Prentice, the Wards, and the twelve jurors were burned in effigy.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>public</b> <b>outcry</b> arose {{when the}} {{government}}, seeking {{the support of}} ethnic minorities, allowed the opening of over 80 Polish schools in Lithuania. At the time, the Polish government was closing Lithuanian schools in the fiercely contested Vilnius Region. The coalition government directly confronted the Christian Democrats when it proposed a 1927 budget that reduced salaries to the clergy and subsidies to Catholic schools. Further controversies were created when the government's military reform program was revealed as a careless downsizing. Some 200 conservative military officers were fired. The military began planning the coup.|$|E
5|$|By 1922, the eight-hour day {{had become}} common in American industry. One {{exception}} was in steel mills, where workers labored through a twelve-hour workday, {{seven days a}} week. Hoover considered this practice barbaric, and got Harding to convene a conference of steel manufacturers {{with a view to}} ending it. The conference established a committee under the leadership of U. S. Steel chairman Elbert Gary, which in early 1923 recommended against ending the practice. Harding sent a letter to Gary deploring the result, which was printed in the press, and <b>public</b> <b>outcry</b> caused the manufacturers to reverse themselves and standardize the eight-hour day.|$|E
2500|$|In 1974, the {{education}} system came under scrutiny with <b>public</b> <b>outcries</b> for improvements. City newspapers ran headlines such as [...] "Angry San Francisco Parents Ask State for Help", [...] "Angy Board Members Talk: Why Schools Don't Improve", [...] "School Costs Rose as Enrollment Fell", [...] "San Francisco Staff Still Outnumbers Teachers", and [...] "Board of Education Exempts Many Bilingual Students from School Bus Program". Subsequently, a commission was appointed to study the city's educational problems, which was considered akin to declaring the San Francisco Unified School District a disaster area.|$|R
50|$|CPP backbenchers and UP {{representatives in}} the National Assembly sharply criticized the government's demand for {{increased}} taxes and, particularly, for a forced savings programme. Urban workers began a protest strike, the most serious {{of a number of}} <b>public</b> <b>outcries</b> against government measures during 1961. Nkrumah's public demands for an end to corruption in the government and the party further undermined popular faith in the national government. A drop in the price paid to cocoa farmers by the government marketing board aroused resentment among a segment of the population that had always been Nkrumah's major opponent.|$|R
50|$|The change {{occurred}} when WRC, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, and local conservationists W.S. “Babe” Howard and Lucius Burch merged their collective resources {{to satisfy the}} <b>public’s</b> <b>outcry</b> {{for the protection of}} the Ghost River section of the Wolf near LaGrange, Tennessee. During 1995, 4,500 acres (18 km²) -- including the Ghost River—were saved from a land and timber company auction. This area was ultimately brought into public ownership as the Wolf River Wildlife Management Area and the Ghost River State Natural Area.|$|R
5|$|In Scotland, the Saltire can {{be flown}} {{at any time}} by any individual, company, local authority, {{hospital}} or school without obtaining express consent. Many local authorities in Scotland fly the Saltire from Council Buildings, however in 2007 Angus Council approved a proposal to replace the Saltire on Council Buildings with a new Angus flag, based on the council's coat of arms. This move led to <b>public</b> <b>outcry</b> across Scotland with more than 7,000 people signing a petition opposing the council's move, leading to a compromise whereby the Angus flag would not replace but be flown alongside the Saltire on council buildings.|$|E
5|$|New {{construction}} almost halted {{when the}} Great Depression {{began in the}} 1930s. As a result, there are few buildings in the district in that era's architectural styles. The post office at Fourth and Broadway, built despite much <b>public</b> <b>outcry</b> over the demolition of its landmark 1894 predecessor, is the district's most notable building of the 1930s. Its stripped-down Classical Revival style shows the influence of Art Deco in its smooth, finished surfaces. The enameled metal facade on a Third Street storefront, dating to 1940, makes it the only building in the district to show any trace of the Streamline Moderne style.|$|E
5|$|She {{coordinated the}} effort against the Communications Decency Act of 1996, {{which was the}} first attempt by the United States Congress to {{introduce}} a form of censorship of speech on the Internet. Krug strongly opposed the notion that libraries should censor the material that they provide to patrons. She supported laws and policies protecting the confidentiality of library use records. When the United States Department of Justice used the authority of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 to conduct searches of what once were confidential library databases, Krug raised a <b>public</b> <b>outcry</b> against this activity by the government.|$|E
40|$|African Studies Seminar series. Paper {{presented}} 3 August, 1998 Bones {{and burial}} places have been invested with special meanings in South Africa's recent political history. Before 1994 funerals of anti-apartheid martyrs often created public spaces for activists to renew resistance against the apartheid regime. Since 1994, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has highlighted the iniquities of apartheid government hit squads by locating {{the graves of}} their victims and returning their remains to their families. However, as the <b>public</b> <b>outcries</b> over Saartje Baartman and Chief Hintsa indicate, the interest in the fate of remains extends back into previous centuries...|$|R
40|$|The {{suicide of}} David Kelly in the UK, {{following}} revelations by the BBC of questionable treatment {{by the government}} with regard to information on Iraq, and the killing of Pim Fortuyn in the Netherlands, after intensive TV election coverage was criticized for ‘demonizing’ the populist politician, have resulted in comparable <b>public</b> <b>outcries</b> and political indignation. Both cases led to a crisis in trust and in similar demands for new arrangements vis-a-vis the responsibility and accountability of public broadcasting. The actual outcomes, however, differ considerably: a strong (self) regulatory reaction in the UK and a limited government response in the Netherlands...|$|R
40|$|Doing a Systematic Review: A Student’s Guide. " Angela The Supreme Court {{ruling in}} the 2010 case, Citizens United v.

Perhaps the most pervasive criticism of the case argues that it unleashed a deluge of big money into elections, distorting the political system to favor corporations.
