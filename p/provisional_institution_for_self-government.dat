The High Court is a <b>provisional</b> <b>institution</b> <b>for</b> the trial of political figures, overseen by the Supreme Court of Niger but formed from seven sitting deputies of the National Assembly of Niger.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a tagger environment for Galician, the native language of Galicia. Galician {{belongs to the}} group of Romance languages which developed from the Latin imposed on the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula by the Romans, with additions from the languages of peoples living here before the colonization, as well as contributions from other languages subsequent to the breaking-up of the Roman Empire. Various historical circumstances led to its not becoming a State language and although it was relegated to informal usage, our vernacular has managed to survive well into the twentieth century when, parallel to the recovery of the <b>institutions</b> <b>for</b> <b>self-government,</b> Galician was once again granted the status of official language for Galicia, together with the Spanish language. From an operational point of view, our proposal is based on the notion of finite automaton, separating the execution strategy from the implementation of the tagging interpreter.

The price, locally known as charan, is paid to village panchayat (an <b>institution</b> of <b>self-government</b> <b>for</b> the rural areas). Charan is paid according to the number and kind of animals of the herders’ groups.

2500|$|Whether the {{declaration}} {{was in fact}} an official act of the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Institutions</b> of Self-Government was unclear; in the end, the Court determined it was issued by [...] "representatives {{of the people of}} Kosovo" [...] acting outside the normal <b>Provisional</b> <b>Institutions</b> of Self-Government. This was significant, since the Serbian argument was that the Kosovo <b>Provisional</b> <b>Institutions</b> of Self-Government had exceeded the authority given to them by the Constitutional Framework (promulgated by UNMIK). In September 2012, international supervision ended, and Kosovo became responsible for its own governance.|$|R

25|$|The {{arguments}} presented are not {{in general}} arguments against the moral right of Kosovo Albanians to self-determination, but focus on the legality or otherwise of the unilateral action of the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Institutions</b> of Self-Government.

Nonetheless, the Court determined that the declaration of independence was not issued by the Assembly of Kosovo or otherwise by <b>Provisional</b> <b>Institutions</b> of Self-Government or any other official body. Once this crucial determination was made, the question the Court had to answer no longer concerned any action of the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Institutions</b> of Self-Government, as the Court had determined that those institutions had not made the declaration of independence.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether and how European integration affects demands <b>for</b> regional <b>self-government</b> in states which are member of the European Union. It does so analysing the dynamics of the demand <b>for</b> <b>self-government</b> in Scotland {{on the basis of a}} comparison between 1979 and 1997. What impact did membership of the EU have on support <b>for</b> <b>self-government</b> at the two points in time? Did the process of European integration between 1979 and 1997 increase support <b>for</b> <b>self-government</b> in Scotland? Through the analysis of public opinion data drawn from a series of election and referendum studies, the paper argues that the demand <b>for</b> <b>self-government</b> in Scotland was strongly affected by the EU dimension from the mid- 1980 s onwards. The different result of the 1997 referendum relative to the 1979 referendum can be explained as the result of a process of Europeanisation between the two points in time. By improving the cost/benefit balance of self-government relative to the status quo, European integration indirectly raised the demand for the former. Two broader conclusions follow: that European integration impacted on the demand <b>for</b> <b>self-government</b> at mass public level through the intervening variable of political actors' strategies and that it was the single market rather than regional policy that had the strongest impact. ...|$|R
