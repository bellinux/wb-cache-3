40|$|The {{ground-based}} velocity track display (GBVTD) {{technique was}} developed to estimate the <b>primary</b> <b>circulations</b> of landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs) from single-Doppler radar data. However, GBVTD cannot process aliased Doppler velocities, which are often encountered in intense TCs. This study presents a new gradient velocity track display (GrVTD) algorithm that is essentially immune to the Doppler velocity aliasing. GrVTD applies the concept of gradient velocity–azimuth display (GVAD) to the GBVTD method. A GrVTD-simplex algorithm is also developed to accompany GrVTD as a self-sufficient algorithm suite. The results from idealized experiments demonstrate that the circulation center and winds retrieved from GrVTD with aliased velocity and GBVTD with dealiased velocity are in good agreement, but GrVTD is more sensitive to random observation errors. GrVTD was applied to Hurricane Charley (2004) {{where the majority of}} the Doppler velocities of the inner-core region were aliased. The GrVTD-retrieved circulation pattern and magnitude are nearly identical to those retrieved in GBVTD with manually dealiased velocities. Overall, the performance of GrVTD is comparable but is more sensitive to the data distribution than that of the original GBVTD using dealiased velocity. GrVTD {{can be used as a}} preprocessor for dealiasing velocity in TCs before the data are used in GBVTD or other algorithms. 1...|$|R
40|$|Secondary circulations (SC) {{associated}} with hurricanes are traditionally regarded as small perturbations superimposed on the <b>primary</b> <b>circulations</b> (PC). The reason behind this treatment roots in an {{observation that the}} magnitude of the SC is about 10 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the PC. This approximation underlines all of the hurricane theories up until now. Recently, Kieu (2004) proposes a revitalizing theory for the development of hurricanes for which a class of exact solutions of the primitive equations is obtained explicitly without appealing to scaling approximation. The solutions share {{some of the most important}} dynamical aspects with observations. According to this theory, the SC turns out to be particular important in determining the three-dimensional structure and temporal evolution of axisymmetric hurricanes. Like all theories for the hurricane development, Kieu's theory however contains an infinite growth of the SC with time. In this study, it will be shown that the infinite growth does not occur. In fact, the solution becomes stationary after a period of time and the SC is able to maintain itself without blowing exponentially if the nonlinear terms in the vertical momentum equation are included. In addition, the SC tends to force the peripheral convection to converge toward the center and builds up a more concentric vortex with a typical hurricane-eye structure. Some potential roles of the SC in the formation of hurricane eyes are discussed. Comment: 16 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

The VHTs are argued to be intrinsic elements of the turbulent vortex dynamo in the tropical atmosphere of the Earth. It is discussed how the generated linkage makes the nascent vortex an integral helical system, supporting a positive feedback between the circulations. The feedback is sustained by only modest fluxes of latent heat from the underlying ocean, convective instability and vortical convection. The feedback indicates a release of potential energy that is converted into kinetic energy of developing large-scale helical vortex.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 32 - 34). ix, 60 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmThe {{evolution and}} structure of Hurricane Danny (1997) is examined via a single-Doppler radar tropical cyclone (TC) wind retrieval technique, the ground-based velocity track display (GBVTD) algorithm. The GBVTD technique is applied to 5 -hours of data gathered simultaneously by two WSR- 88 D radars in Mobile, AL (KMOB) and Slidell, LA (KLIX) at ~ 6 minute intervals. The circulation centers and the <b>primary</b> <b>circulations</b> of Danny derived from these two independent radar observations (~ 60 volumes from each radar) are {{used to evaluate the}} accuracy of the GBVTD algorithm and the GBVTD-simplex center finding algorithm. Other observations, such as dual-Doppler analysis, dropwindsonde. and in-situ measurements from the NOAA WP- 3 D and the U. S. Air Force Reserve Command WC-l 30 (AFRC), aircraft provide independent assessments of the TC center and structure. It is found that the GBVTD-simplex derived centers, which used only the maximum mean tangential wind as the sole criterion. were unsatisfactory and unstable. An improved algorithm is proposed to seek time continuity in RMW, maximum mean tangential wind, and the center position {{in order to reduce the}} large fluctuations experienced in this study and the results are used to quantify the accuracy of the derived circulation centers. The quality of the GBVTD-derived circulation from these new centers is assessed. Danny's kinematic structure retrieved from KLIX and KMOB data using the improved sets of centers are consistent with the structures retrieved from the dual-Doppler analyses. Danny evolved from a mostly axisymmetric TC into a wave number one asymmetric TC then returned to an axisymmetric TC during this five-hour period...|$|R
