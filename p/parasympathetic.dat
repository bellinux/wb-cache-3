5|$|The pudendal nerve {{has both}} motor and sensory functions. It does not carry <b>para{{sympathetic}}</b> fibers but does carry sympathetic fibers.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{approaches}} to treating Chagas disease: antiparasitic treatment, {{to kill the}} parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms and signs of the infection. Management uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the <b>parasympathetic</b> nervous system. Autonomic disease imparted by Chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus, megacolon and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that explain why Chagas targets the <b>parasympathetic</b> autonomic nervous system and spares the sympathetic autonomic nervous system remain poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{cranial nerves}} have sensory or <b>parasympathetic</b> ganglia (collections of cell bodies) of neurons, which are located {{outside of the}} brain (but can be inside or outside of the skull).|$|E
5|$|The {{vagus nerve}} (X) {{provides}} sensory and autonomic (<b>parasympathetic)</b> motor innervation to {{structures in the}} neck and also {{to most of the}} organs in the chest and abdomen.|$|E
5|$|Loss of {{function}} of the vagus nerve (X) {{will lead to a}} loss of <b>parasympathetic</b> innervation to {{a very large number of}} structures. Major effects of damage to the vagus nerve may include a rise in blood pressure and heart rate. Isolated dysfunction of only the vagus nerve is rare, but can be diagnosed by a hoarse voice, due to dysfunction of one of its branches, the recurrent laryngeal nerve.|$|E
5|$|Lymphatic {{drainage}} frequently {{passes the}} prelaryngeal lymph nodes (located {{just above the}} isthmus), and the pretracheal and paratracheal lymph nodes. The gland receives sympathetic nerve supply from the superior, middle and inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk. The gland receives <b>parasympathetic</b> nerve supply from the superior laryngeal nerve and the recurrent laryngeal nerve.|$|E
5|$|The lungs are {{supplied}} by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. Input from the <b>parasympathetic</b> nervous system occurs via the vagus nerve. When stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the smooth muscle lining the bronchus and bronchioles, {{and increases the}} secretions from glands. The lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 receptors in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.|$|E
5|$|The sensory ganglia are {{directly}} correspondent to {{dorsal root ganglia}} of spinal nerves and are known as cranial sensory ganglia. Sensory ganglia exist for nerves with sensory function: V, VII, VIII, IX, X. There are also <b>parasympathetic</b> ganglia, which {{are part of the}} autonomic nervous system for cranial nerves III, VII, IX and X.|$|E
5|$|The {{vagus nerve}} is a long, {{wandering}} nerve {{that emerges from}} the brainstem and provides <b>parasympathetic</b> stimulation to {{a large number of}} organs in the thorax and abdomen, including the heart. The nerves from the sympathetic trunk emerge through the T1-T4 thoracic ganglia and travel to both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, {{as well as to the}} atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than <b>parasympathetic</b> fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heart rate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions. Norepinephrine binds to the betaâ€“1 receptor.|$|E
5|$|The heart {{receives}} nerve {{signals from}} the vagus nerve and from nerves arising from the sympathetic trunk. These nerves act to influence, but not control, the heart rate. Sympathetic nerves also influence the force of heart contraction. Signals that travel along these nerves arise from two paired cardiovascular centres in the medulla oblongata. The vagus nerve of the <b>parasympathetic</b> nervous system acts to decrease the heart rate, and nerves from the sympathetic trunk act to increase the heart rate. These nerves form a network of nerves that lies over the heart called the cardiac plexus.|$|E
5|$|The somatic motor fibers that {{innervate}} the laryngeal and pharyngeal {{muscles are}} located in the nucleus ambiguus and emerge from the medulla in the cranial root of the accessory nerve. Fibers cross over to and join the vagus nerve in the jugular foramen. Sensory cell bodies {{are located in}} the inferior jugular ganglion, and the fibers terminate in the solitary nucleus. <b>Parasympathetic</b> fibers to segments of the trachea and esophagus in the neck originate in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{pressure}} {{and heart rate}} {{are influenced by the}} vasomotor centre of the medulla, which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest. It does this by influencing the sympathetic and <b>parasympathetic</b> nervous systems via the vagus nerve. Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch, and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve. Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve. This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla. Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} {{and rate of}} CSF generation are influenced by hormones and the content and pressure of blood and CSF. For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there {{is less of a}} pressure difference between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and the CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the choroid plexus and CSF generation. The autonomic nervous system influences choroid plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the sympathetic nervous system increasing secretion and the <b>parasympathetic</b> nervous system decreasing it. Changes in the pH of the blood can affect the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and some drugs (such as frusemide, acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter) have the potential to impact membrane channels.|$|E
5|$|The {{peripheral}} nerves of the <b>parasympathetic</b> {{nervous system}} that carry {{messages to the}} brain (afferent nerve fibers) may explain why people with complete SCI feel sexual and climactic sensations. One proposed explanation for orgasm in women despite complete SCI is that the vagus nerve bypasses the spinal cord and carries sensory information from the genitals directly to the brain. Women with complete injuries can achieve sexual arousal and orgasm through stimulation of the clitoris, cervix, or vagina, which are each innervated by different nerve pathways, which suggests that even if SCI interferes with one area, function might be preserved in others. In both injured and uninjured people, the brain {{is responsible for the}} way sensations of climax are perceived: the qualitative experiences associated with climax are modulated by the brain, rather than a specific area of the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{esophagus}} is {{innervated by}} the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk. The vagus nerve has a <b>parasympathetic</b> function, supplying {{the muscles of}} the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers travel in the vagus nerve to supply the muscles. The upper striated muscle, and upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance the function of the vagus nerve, increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parasympathetic</b> {{innervation}} to the {{salivary glands}} is carried via cranial nerves. The parotid gland receives its <b>parasympathetic</b> {{input from the}} glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) via the otic ganglion, while the submandibular and sublingual glands receive their <b>parasympathetic</b> input from the facial nerve (CN VII) via the submandibular ganglion. These nerves release acetylcholine and substance P, which activate the IP3 and DAG pathways respectively.|$|E
25|$|Salivary glands are innervated, either {{directly}} or indirectly, by the <b>parasympathetic</b> and sympathetic arms of the autonomic nervous system. <b>Parasympathetic</b> stimulation evokes a copious flow of saliva. In contrast, sympathetic stimulation produces either a small flow, which is rich in protein, or no flow at all.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of saliva is stimulated {{both by the}} sympathetic nervous system and the <b>parasympathetic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sympathetic {{stimulation}} of saliva is to facilitate respiration, whereas <b>parasympathetic</b> stimulation is to facilitate digestion.|$|E
25|$|The vagal and sacral {{neural crest}} cells develop into the ganglia of the enteric nervous {{system and the}} <b>parasympathetic</b> ganglia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parasympathetic</b> {{stimulation}} originates {{from the}} cardioinhibitory region with impulses traveling via the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X). The vagus nerve sends branches {{to both the}} SA and AV nodes, and to portions of both the atria and ventricles. <b>Parasympathetic</b> stimulation releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction. ACh slows HR by opening chemical- or ligand-gated potassium ion channels to slow the rate of spontaneous depolarization, which extends repolarization and increases the time before the next spontaneous depolarization occurs. Without any nervous stimulation, the SA node would establish a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm. Since resting rates are considerably less than this, it becomes evident that <b>parasympathetic</b> stimulation normally slows HR. This is similar to an individual driving a car with {{one foot on the}} brake pedal. To speed up, one need merely remove oneâ€™s foot from the brake and let the engine increase speed. In the case of the heart, decreasing <b>parasympathetic</b> stimulation decreases the release of ACh, which allows HR to increase up to approximately 100 bpm. Any increases beyond this rate would require sympathetic stimulation.|$|E
25|$|While {{heart rhythm}} is {{regulated}} entirely by the sinoatrial node under normal conditions, heart rate is regulated by sympathetic and <b>parasympathetic</b> input to the sinoatrial node. The accelerans nerve provides sympathetic input {{to the heart}} by releasing norepinephrine onto {{the cells of the}} sinoatrial node (SA node), and the vagus nerve provides <b>parasympathetic</b> input to the heart by releasing acetylcholine onto sinoatrial node cells. Therefore, stimulation of the accelerans nerve increases heart rate, while stimulation of the vagus nerve decreases it.|$|E
25|$|During heart transplant, the {{vagus nerve}} is severed, thus {{removing}} <b>parasympathetic</b> {{influence over the}} myocardium. However, some limited return of sympathetic nerves has been demonstrated in humans.|$|E
25|$|Bethanechol {{can also}} be used to treat {{megacolon}} by means of its direct cholinergic action and its stimulation of muscarinic receptors which bring about a <b>parasympathetic</b> like effect.|$|E
25|$|One {{example is}} again neurons of the {{sympathetic}} nervous system, which release noradrenaline, which, in addition, generates an inhibitory effect on presynaptic terminals of neurons of the <b>parasympathetic</b> nervous system.|$|E
25|$|The bladder {{receives}} motor innervation {{from both}} sympathetic fibers, {{most of which}} arise from the superior and inferior hypogastric plexuses and nerves, and from <b>parasympathetic</b> fibers, which come from the pelvic splanchnic nerves.|$|E
25|$|The nerve {{supply of}} the upper vagina is {{provided}} by the sympathetic and <b>parasympathetic</b> areas of the pelvic plexus. The lower vagina is supplied by the pudendal nerve supplying the lower area.|$|E
25|$|The {{supply of}} <b>parasympathetic</b> nerves {{to the face}} and the upper jaw (maxilla) derives from the greater {{superficial}} petrosal (GSP) branch of cranial nerve VII, the facial nerve. The GSP nerve joins the deep petrosal nerve (of the sympathetic nervous system), derived from the carotid plexus, to form the vidian nerve (in the vidian canal) that traverses the pterygopalatine ganglion (an autonomic ganglion of the maxillary nerve), wherein only the <b>parasympathetic</b> nerves form synapses, which serve the lacrimal gland and the glands of the nose and of the palate, via the (upper jaw) maxillary division of cranial nerve V, the trigeminal nerve.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhibition}} of the sodium pump may also improve baroreceptor sensitivity in HF and may {{explain some of}} the neurohormonal effects of digoxin. Digoxin also has important <b>parasympathetic</b> effects, particularly on the atrioventricular node.|$|E
25|$|Satellite glial {{cells are}} the {{principal}} glial cells found in the peripheral nervous system, specifically in sensory, sympathetic, and <b>parasympathetic</b> ganglia. They compose the thin cellular sheaths that surround the individual neurons in these ganglia.|$|E
25|$|The {{heart rate}} is rhythmically {{generated}} by the sinoatrial node. It is also influenced by central factors through sympathetic and <b>parasympathetic</b> nerves. Nervous influence over the heartrate is centralized within the two paired cardiovascular centres of the medulla oblongata. The cardioaccelerator regions stimulate activity via sympathetic stimulation of the cardioaccelerator nerves, and the cardioinhibitory centers decrease heart activity via <b>parasympathetic</b> stimulation as one component of the vagus nerve. During rest, both centers provide slight stimulation to the heart, contributing to autonomic tone. This is a similar concept to tone in skeletal muscles. Normally, vagal stimulation predominates as, left unregulated, the SA node would initiate a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, baroreceptors are stretch receptors {{located in}} the aortic sinus, carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other locations, {{including}} pulmonary vessels and {{the right side of}} the heart itself. Rates of firing from the baroreceptors represent blood pressure, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood. The cardiac centers monitor baroreceptor firing to maintain cardiac homeostasis, a mechanism called the baroreceptor reflex. With increased pressure and stretch, the rate of baroreceptor firing increases, and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase <b>parasympathetic</b> stimulation. As pressure and stretch decrease, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases, and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease <b>parasympathetic</b> stimulation.|$|E
25|$|Both {{sympathetic}} and <b>parasympathetic</b> stimuli {{flow through the}} paired cardiac plexus near {{the base of the}} heart. The cardioaccelerator center also sends additional fibers, forming the cardiac nerves via sympathetic ganglia (the cervical ganglia plus superior thoracic ganglia T1â€“T4) to both the SA and AV nodes, plus additional fibers to the atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than <b>parasympathetic</b> fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heartrate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions.|$|E
25|$|ACE inhibitors {{have also}} been shown to cause a central {{enhancement}} of <b>parasympathetic</b> nervous system activity in healthy volunteers and patients with heart failure. This action may reduce the prevalence of malignant cardiac arrhythmias, and the reduction in sudden death reported in large clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|The {{stomach is}} {{surrounded}} by <b>parasympathetic</b> (stimulant) and sympathetic (inhibitor) plexuses (networks of blood vessels and nerves in the anterior gastric, posterior, superior and inferior, celiac and myenteric), which regulate both the secretory activity of the stomach and the motor (motion) activity of its muscles.|$|E
25|$|It {{plays a role}} in {{a variety}} of homeostatic {{functions}} related to basic survival needs, such as taste, visceral sensation, and autonomic control. The insula controls autonomic functions through the regulation of the sympathetic and <b>parasympathetic</b> systems. It has a role in regulating the immune system.|$|E
