Existence of these fault’s {{have been detected}} by using 2 D resistivity method. In this research, measurement of 2 D resistivity is conducted by using Dipole-Dipole configuration. Configuration {{has been done in}} two lines. The first line is length of measurement 200 meters and direction E 98 ° S and second line the <b>path</b> <b>lenght</b> of 120 meters and direction N 50 E. From the resistivity section, position of fault is founded. For first line, position of fault stays at point 25; 43; 57; 97, 5; 110 and 136 m. While for second line position of fault stays at point 33; 50 and 100 m...|$|E
40|$|Our {{purpose here}} is to (1) {{investigate}} {{the structure of the}} personal networks developed on mixi, a Japanese social networking service (SNS), and (2) to consider the governing mechanism which guides participants of a SNS to form an aggregate network. Our findings are as follows:the clustering coefficient of the network is as high as 0. 33 while the characteristic <b>path</b> <b>lenght</b> is as low as 5. 5. A network among central users (over 300 edges) consist of two cliques, which seems to be very fragile. Community-affiliation network suggests there are several easy-entry communities which later lead users to more high-entry, unique-theme communities. The analysis on connectedness within a community reveals the importance of real-world interaction. Lastly, we depict a probable image of the entire ecology on mixi among users and communities, which contributes broadly to social systems on the Web...|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{patterns}} {{influence the}} persistence of populations and communities, giving useful insights on the mechanisms that confer robustness to ecological networks. The mechanisms that regulate the spatial distribution of species {{are related to the}} ability of populations to respond to spatio-temporal variations of ecological conditions, contributing to network structure and dynamic of persisting communities. We applied the framework of complex network to study the colonization process of Phragmites australis leaf detritus in six different pools in the patchy aquatic environment of Tarquinia saltern (central Italy). We used the colonization data of macroinvertebrates on leaf detritus assigning a link between two taxa if they shared a common pool, and measured their positional importance within the network. We found high clustering and short <b>path</b> <b>lenght</b> among nodes that is representative of small-world pattern, showing the relationship between robustness and nodes synchronicity in network attachment dynamics. Here we show how the identification of local (individual use of substrates by macroinvertebrates) and global (network properties) patterns in community structure could be the key to better understand the ecology, evolution and management of complex ecological network...|$|E
40|$|A short {{overview}} {{is given}} of atmospheric effects (attenuation, scattering, adjacency effect, polarization, turbulences) {{and how they}} influence image data. Several atmospheric correction methods are discussed: physically modelling the atmosphere, using knowledge of target properties (test sites for reference targets or ground truth measurements), and a mixture of both (inverse modelling, different path lengths). Principles of constructing a model atmosphere and of using differences in <b>path</b> <b>lenghts</b> for atmospheric correction are illustrated...|$|R

The method {{is based on}} Bidirectional Path Tracing in which we truncated <b>path</b> <b>lenghts</b> to improve GPU performance and introduced a number of Virtual Light Points to organize the Light Tracing pass. Results show that a rendered image is accurated if confronted with the corresponding reference image, and it is synthetized at a reasonably interactive rate when the algorithm is implemented on a commodity GPU...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} paper (Moskalenko et al., 2002), {{it has been}} shown that the flux of {{secondary}} cosmic ray (CR) antiprotons appears to be contradictory to measurements of secondary to primary nuclei ratios in cosmic rays when calculated in the same Galactic propagation model. The contradiction appears as a value of the diffusion coefficient necessary to match the secondary ratios ¯p/p and B/C. In particlular, it was shown that the reacceleration models designed to match secondary to primary nuclei ratios produce too few antiprotons. It is, however, clear that some reacceleration is unavoidable in the turbulent interstellar medium. Here we discuss an idea of how to improve reacceleration model by allowing for the damping of interstellar turbulences on the small scale by cosmic rays, mostly protons. This would lead to increase in the mean free <b>path</b> <b>lenghts</b> at low energies, the well-known phenomena empirically discovered in the Leaky Box models, thus producing less secondary nuclei. Antiprotons will remain almost non-affected due to their high energy threshold of production cross section...|$|R
40|$|An {{avalanche}} path is a landform, that {{is being}} modeled by surface snow avalanches, debris flows and other slope processes. It consists of starting zone, track and runout zone. The submitted bachelor thesis {{is concerned with the}} characteristics of avalanche paths used in literature and generates their classification. The morphometric GIS analysis is performed in the Eastern High Sudetes. The measured vlaues of 16 avalanche paths from 6 sites are statistically processed and compared. The Sudetic paths are shorter but they have similar slope in comparison with paths in alpine environment. The spatial distribution of avalanche paths is bound to lee parts of the anemo-orographic systems. The aspect is predominantly southeastern, the slope is between 20 and 30 ř and the length is usually between 200 and 400 m. The <b>path</b> <b>lenght</b> depends inversely on the slope of the starting zone. There is also a relation between the avalanche path morphology and the area of alpine tundra on the etchplain above the timberline, from where the snow is being blowed to the starting zones. Key words: snow avalanche, morphometry, Eastern High Sudetes, Altvatergebirge, Glatzer Schneeber...|$|E
40|$|A model {{which takes}} into account both stray light and polychromatic light was used to predict and {{evaluate}} linearity in on-capillary detection in capillary electrophoresis (CE). According to the model the stray light is the major factor which determines linearity under typical CE operating conditions. By calculating theoretical absorbance versus concentration plots, the influence of different levels of stray light and polychromatic light on linearity is demonstrated. Experimentally, six light-emitting diodes (LEDs) {{in the range from}} 563 to 654 nm were examined as light sources for on-capillary detection in CE. Fitting theoretical curves to measured linearity plots enabled determination of the values of both effective <b>path</b> <b>lenght</b> and stray light for a particular detection system. The detector linearity for the four LEDs was compared to mercury and tungsten lamps used with interference filters. For potassium permanganate as the test compound, the linear range for a 563 nm LED was two times greater than that for a mercury lamp operated at 546 nm. The relatively poor linearity of the mercury lamp detector is explained by its high level of stray light. The noise of the LED 563 -based detector was the same as for the mercury lamp, whereas the other LEDs of higher light intensity gave approximately half the noise of the mercury lamp. The lowest noise level of 3 × 10 - 5 AU was obtained for the LED at 554 nm (determined at a detector time constant of 0. 1 s) ...|$|E
40|$|Ply-lift and {{pocketing}} are {{two critical}} anomalies of carbon cloth phenolic composites (CCPC) in rocket nozzle applications. Ply lift occurs at low temperatures when the A/P and in-plane permeabilities of the composite materials {{are still very}} low and in-plane porous paths are blocked. Pocketing occurs at elevated temperatures when in-plane permeability is reduced by the A/P compressive stress. The thermostructural response of CCPC in a rapid heating environment involves simultaneous heat, mass, and momentum transfer along with the degradation of phenolic resin in a multiphase system with temperature- and time-dependent material properties as well as dynamic processing conditions. Three temperature regions represent the consequent chemical reactions, material transformations, and property transitions, and provide a quick qualitative method for characterizing the thermostructural behavior of a CCPC. In order to optimize the FM 5939 LDCCP (low density carbon cloth phenolic) for the nozzle performance required in the Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM) program, a fundamental study on LDCCP materials was conducted. The cured composite has a density of 1. 0 +/- 0. 5 gm/cc which includes 10 to 25 percent void volume. The weight percent of carbon microballoon is low (7 - 15 percent). However, they account for approximately {{one third of the}} volume and historically their percentages have not been controlled very tightly. In addition, the composite properties show no correlation with microballoon weight percent or fiber properties (e. g. fiber density or fiber moisture adsorption capacity). Test results concerning the ply-lift anomaly in the MNASA motor firings were: (1) Steeper ply angle (shorter <b>path</b> <b>lenght)</b> designs minimized/eliminated by lifting, (2) material with higher void volume ply lifted less frequently, (3) materials with high (greater than 9 percent) microballoon content had a higher rate of ply lifting, and (4) LDCCP materials failed at microballoon-resin interfaces. The objectives of this project are: (1) to investigate the effects of carbon microballoon and cabosil fillers as well as fiber heat treatment on plylift-related mechanical properties, (2) to develop a science-based thermostructural process model for the carbon phenolics. The model can be used in the future for the selection of the improved ASRM materials, (3) to develop the micro-failure mechanisms for the ply-lift initiation and propagation processes during the thermoelastic region of phenolic degradation, i. e. postcuring and devolatilization...|$|E
40|$|Chaser (Csr) was {{uncovered}} in a gamma mutagenesis screen to identify genes that modify the larval foraging behavior of sitters to rovers. Rover larvae have significantly longer <b>path</b> <b>lenghts</b> than sitters while foraging on a yeast and water paste. This difference {{is influenced by}} one major gene, foraging (for), which has two naturally occurring alleles, for(R) (rover) and for(s) (sitter). In a mutagenesis screen for modifiers of for, we identified three lines with viable mutations on chromosome 3 that alter foraging behavior. Each of these mutations increased larval path lengths in for(s) /for(s) larvae in a dominant fashion, and were not separable by recombination. These mutations are therefore probably allelic and define a new gene that we have called Csr. Csr was genetically localized using the lethal-tagging technique. This technique resulted in seven lines with {{a significant decrease in}} larval path-length and recessive lethal mutations on chromosome 3. We refer to these as reverted Csr (Csr(rv)) lines. Deficiencies that uncovered cytologically visible chromosome rearrangements in three of the seven reverted lines were used in a complementation analysis. In this way we mapped the lethal mutations in the Csr(rv) lines to cytological region 95 F 7 - 96 A 1 on the right arm of chromosome 3...|$|R
40|$|This system {{presented}} in this thesis report will be put into practice in a sensory system for dental drilling. The aim of this system is to provide real-time feedback to the practitioner about the anatomical structure in close vicinity of the drill bit. Therefore, the system {{has to deal with}} in vivo, in situ bone tissue, bone tissue within a living organism that cannot be removed from the human body for analysis. Hence, non-destructive biopsy is desired. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging is able to provide optical biopsy at a high resolution and in real time. With the use of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), e. g. blood vessels, nerves and sinuses close to the drill can be detected before the drill bit does damage to these vulnerable anatomical structures. Silicon process technology offers a promising platform for a relatively cheap Time-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (TD-OCT) system. A first step into the direction of a single-chip TD-OCT system is the development of a thermally excited Optical Delay Line (ODL) or Thermo-Optical Delay Line (TODL). This thesis project is dedicated to the characterisation of the TODL in order to find the voltage excitation waveform that results in a linear variation in effective optical path length. By making use of the models, non-linearites can be compensated and the limited bandwidth can be extended by pre-emphasis of the voltage excitation waveform. Two models are presented, based on the general heat equation for conduction. One model utilizes Fourier analysis to solve the heat equation and is a linear model by definition. The second model uses numerical methods and is able to incorporate non-linearities, such as relations for thermal conductivity, diffusivity and the variation of the refractive index of silicon as a function of temperature. Measurements are conducted to verify the modeling. The linear model has been shown to perform poorly. The non-linear model was able to compensate for the non-linearities mentioned. However, first results showed that the TODL was behaving slightly slower than expected. The non-linear model was corrected for this behaviour by scalling down the relation for thermal diffusivity. The corrected non-linear model achieved a linear variation of the effective optical <b>path</b> <b>lenght</b> over a scanning range of 200 ?m at a line scanning rate of 10 kHz.
