25|$|A {{new report}} in January 2002 {{revealed}} that Few had ordered no new firefighting or emergency services {{vehicles in the}} past 18 months, and that the city's fleet was quickly approaching decrepitude. A third of all pumper trucks were out of service due to ill-repair and age, and the city was <b>patching</b> <b>up</b> 15-year-old vehicles (which were due to have been scrapped four years ago) to fight fires. Not a single pumper could be held in reserve to fight major fires {{due to the lack}} of vehicles. In one case, the city pressed a fire academy training vehicle into service because it ran out of pumpers. (Reserve pumpers had fallen to 11 in 2002 from 13 in July 2000, five fewer than required.) The department was also short three of the eight ladder trucks required for reserves. Few blamed city officials for not releasing $1.8 million to buy six new pumpers, even though he spent $32,000 to purchase a new command vehicle and an undisclosed sum to buy himself and other commanders 14 new cars. The report also showed that fire truck drivers were inadequately trained and poorly supervised, and were having too many accidents. Because of the lack of reserve vehicles, drivers also continued to operate vehicles even though they should have turned them in for repair. This worsened the repair issues when the vehicle finally failed. Although Few ordered the six pumpers by June 2002, there were still too few trucks in reserve.|$|E

According to Richards, the production of Watch Me Disappear was a process that contained [...] "a fair bit of friction". Ammendola was critical of Chiccarelli's style of production and the short amount of time spent in the studio. The recording process also took its toll on the relationships in the band.

500|$|The Radical Republicans were {{satisfied}} {{that they had}} secured civil rights for blacks, but were disappointed that the amendment would not also secure political rights for blacks; in particular, the right to vote.

After the appointment of al-Hajjaj as governor of Iraq and the eastern provinces of the Caliphate in 694, relations between the haughty and overbearing al-Hajjaj and the Iraqi nobility quickly became strained. Nevertheless, in 699 or 700, al-Hajjaj appointed Ibn al-Ash'ath as commander of a huge Iraqi army, the so-called [...] "Peacock Army", to subdue the troublesome principality of Zabulistan, whose ruler, the Zunbīl, vigorously resisted Arab expansion. During the campaign, al-Hajjaj's overbearing behaviour caused [...] Ibn al-Ash'ath and the army to rebel. After <b>patching</b> <b>up</b> {{an agreement with the}} Zunbīl, the army started on its march back to Iraq. On the way, a mutiny against al-Hajjaj developed into a full-fledged anti-Umayyad rebellion.|$|E

[...] In a separate publication from BBC, Fraser McAlpine wrote that although the song's lyrics were dumb, silly and crude, [...] "none of [...] are bad things in themselves." [...] McAlpine complimented the overall sound of Kesha and Cruz's vocal work together on the song commenting that [...] "the jarring clash between Taio's supersmooth soul-gentleman image and Kesha's sloppy drunken nonsense is genuinely fascinating. The song actually transforms from one kind of a thing to another, depending who has their hand on the microphone." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{meeting with}} Morris later in September, Wild {{decided it was}} time to speak his mind: he said that [...] "in many areas Australia needed desperately to dig itself out of the {{stagnation}} of 19th century thought." [...] He believed the reaction highlighted Australia's general malaise; he deplored the emphasis on the short term and the preference for <b>patching</b> <b>up</b> decaying and unprofitable systems, ignoring imaginative plans for the future. [...] He called for a much larger, objective investigation by independent experts, including those from overseas countries which already had fast trains. In doing so he emphasised that he was not seeking government funding for the scheme – merely support for a $500,000 study that would last 12 months.|$|E

Bríd Smith seconded the nomination. The nomination of Boyd Barrett was defeated by 9 votes to 111.

Russell Crowe was considered as a replacement, but he turned it down after taking what he thought to be a similar role in Gladiator. Day-Lewis was offered the role for a second time, but declined again. Executive Producer Mark Ordesky saw Mortensen in a play. Mortensen's son, a fan of the book, convinced him to take the role.

2500|$|While sailing off Bermuda Cleopatra sighted a sail--the 40-gun French frigate Ville de Milan.

2500|$|In 1864, after Bytown {{was chosen}} as the new capital of the Province of Canada, Rideau Hall was leased by the Crown from the McKay family for $4,000 per year and was {{intended}} to serve only as a temporary home for the viceroy until a proper government house could be constructed. The next year, Frederick Preston Rubidge oversaw the refinishing of the original villa and designed additions to accommodate the new functions. It was enlarged to three or four times the original size, mostly by way of a new 49 room wing, and, once complete, the first Governor General of Canada, the Viscount Monck, took residence. These additions were opposed by George Brown, who claimed that [...] "the governor general's residence is a miserable little house, and the grounds those of an ambitious country squire." [...] Prime Minister John A. Macdonald agreed, complaining that more had been spent on <b>patching</b> <b>up</b> Rideau Hall than could have been used to construct a new royal palace. Nonetheless, the gatehouse was enhanced by Rubidge and the entire property purchased outright in 1868 for the sum of $82,000. Thereafter, the house became the social centre of Ottawa—even Canada—hosting foreign visitors (the first being Grand Duke Alexis, son of Tsar Alexander II), investitures, swearing-in ceremonies, balls, dinners, garden parties, children's parties, and theatrical productions in the ballroom (initiated by the Earl and Countess of Dufferin), in which members of the household and viceregal family would participate. Probably the largest event held in the ballroom was a fancy dress ball hosted by the Dufferins that took place on the evening of 23 February 1876 and which saw approximately 1,500 guests attending.|$|E
