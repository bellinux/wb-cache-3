40|$|<b>Persistent</b> <b>offenders</b> {{have been}} {{a feature of the}} {{criminal}} justice system in New Zealand, at least during the period between 1923 and 1985, and these <b>persistent</b> <b>offenders</b> have been part of an underclass excluded from or marginal to participation in paid work and the dominant consumption patterns of society. <b>Persistent</b> <b>offenders</b> have also subscribed to a predatory moral and normative order. This thesis sets out to explain the existence of the predatory underclass, its value system and the prospects for its integration within the mainstream of society. A theory of social regulation is developed which proceeds through a critique of the works of Durkheim and Merton. The theory draws a distinction between primary and secondary levels of regulation, and relies upon the work of the 'regulation school' developed in France. The theory postulates that the offending of <b>persistent</b> <b>offenders</b> is the product of two social mechanisms, the exclusion tendency and the predatory potential of society. The exclusion tendency is the product of the way in which production and consumption are socially organised in capitalist societies. Production and consumption are linked through participation in paid work. The predatory potential on the other hand is a reflection of the extent to which persons are able to engage in the consumption norms of society without making a legitimate contribution to the consumption needs of society. Primary and secondary regulatory forces are analysed from 1923 to 1985 in order to specify the way in which the exclusion tendency and the predatory potential have interacted. Major changes in the way in which the two mechanisms have interacted are noted. Patterns of persistent offending are then analysed in the light of this analysis and the nature of persistent offending in two periods is contrasted to make clear the specific nature of the problem of persistent offending in the period from 1970 to 1985. The study stops at 1985 in view of the changes to the criminal justice system and the basis upon which persons would be sentenced to imprisonment. It is too soon to be able to specify whether the change in the legislation has altered the way in which imprisonment is being used and its impact upon persistent offending. The analysis provides an understanding of the changing nature of persistent offending and concludes that the problem of reintegrating <b>persistent</b> <b>offenders</b> into the mainstream of New Zealand society is unlikely unless the basis of the contribution and rewards system is reconstructed on a basis which is regarded as fair and reasonable by the <b>persistent</b> <b>offenders</b> themselves. At this time there is no evidence that they would regard the system as it exists or is likely to develop into, as fair and just...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Numerous operationalizations of {{persistent}} offending {{have been used}} in the extant research with the assumption that these findings are generalizable. We tested this assumption by comparing the criminal careers of <b>persistent</b> <b>offenders</b> identified by different methods. Method: We examined 38 operationalizations {{of persistent}} offending and the groups they identified. Criminal careers were measured using official conviction data from the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development (n = 411). Results: The groups of <b>persistent</b> <b>offenders</b> differed in prevalence rates (ranging from 1. 24 % to 29. 53 % of the sample), average age of onset (from 10. 86 to 26. 07 years), average criminal career duration (from 16. 96 to 39. 86 years), average convictions (from 4. 03 to 23. 33, λ ranged from 0. 3 to 1. 17 convictions per year), and offender overlap (from 0 % to 100 %, ORs ranged from 0. 34 to 787. 5). <b>Persistent</b> <b>offenders</b> identified by the Group Based Trajectory Model were least likely to be identified by any other operationalization. Conclusion: Different operationalizations generally identified qualitatively different <b>offenders</b> as <b>persistent,</b> suggesting that the findings on persistent offending in the literature may not be generalizable across studies.

50|$|The right {{hemisphere}} {{is responsible for}} spatial awareness and orientation. Deficits {{on this side of}} the brain can lead to problems in facial and expression recognition. These impairments can do more than just interfere with early attachment and bonding. They can lead to adverse parenting due to the child's inappropriate responses to parental moods or expressions. In one experiment, 868 seven-year-old boys in Pennsylvania were divided into groups: one group on the life-course <b>persistent</b> <b>offender</b> path, one on the adolescent limited path, and one control group.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the concept of the}} <b>persistent</b> <b>offender</b> as a group within society, and the presumed impact of that discrete group upon society via a case study of offending in Crewe between 1880 and 1940. The findings of persistent offending in Crewe challenge the assumptions and prejudices of the period, about the links between unemployment and crime {{and the extent to which}} crime was an enduring ‘career’. There were no ‘hardened’ persistent offenders in the sample of the type envisaged by contemporary comment, though the role of drink in offending was sustained; and there was no clear ‘type’ of offender either. Examination of the life histories of a selection of offenders is shown to raise a number of interdisciplinary questions, challenging the assumptions of criminologists and legal scholars in relation to the role of legislation in the management of criminality, including the concept (of interest also to historians) that reformation of the criminal was more achievable in the past than it is in the overregulated present...|$|E

40|$|The Prolific {{and other}} Priority Offender (PPO) {{strategy}} {{was introduced by}} the Home Office {{in the summer of}} 2004, with the central aim of reducing crime and reducing re- offending by those who persistently cause the most crime and harm locally. Within Birmingham, this was introduced into a context where a number of existing projects and strategies were already being implemented on a piecemeal basis to address specific targeted offenders, either through the <b>Persistent</b> <b>Offender</b> Partnership programme (POPP), or Project Chrysalis. Strategic direction on the management of prolific offenders in Birmingham is provided through the Drug Treatment and Offender Management Core Priority Group. The situation in Birmingham with regards to managing prolific and other priority offenders is highly complex, involving many partners at both strategic and delivery levels. This study aimed to assess the current provision of services for prolific and other priority offenders in Birmingham, and to identify gaps in the service delivery that can inform the development of the local PPO strategy and an action plan for the forthcoming year. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 key personnel involved at either the strategic or service delivery level for the PPO strategy.

50|$|Quantitative {{research}} was completed on 9,945 juvenile male offenders {{between the ages}} of 10 and 18 in the 1970s. The longitudinal birth cohort was used to examine a trend among a small percentage of career criminals who accounted for the largest percentage of crime activity. The trend exhibited a new phenomenon among habitual offenders. The phenomenon indicated that only 6% of the youth qualified under their definition of a habitual offender (known today as life-course <b>persistent</b> <b>offenders,</b> or career criminals) and yet were responsible for 52% of the delinquency within the entire study. The same 6% of chronic offenders accounted for 71% of the murders and 69% of the aggravated assaults. This phenomenon was later researched among an adult population in 1977 and resulted in similar findings. S. A. Mednick did a birth cohort of 30,000 males and found that 1% of the males were responsible {{for more than half of}} the criminal activity. The habitual crime behavior found among juveniles is similar to that of adults. As stated before most life-course <b>persistent</b> <b>offenders</b> begin exhibiting antisocial, violent, and/or delinquent behavior, prior to adolescence.

40|$|Much {{research}} has been conducted in the area of criminal careers and related topics such as persistence. In the study of persistence {{it is clear from the}} number of varying definitions that there is no consensus on how criminologists should define persistence, and for that matter, persistent behaviour. In anticipation of further work in the area of persistence and ultimately, crime reduction, this study is an explorative attempt at providing an understanding of the term persistence. Definitions of persistence in the literature are dependent on official data, such as information on arrests, to examine offender behaviour over time. This quantification of behaviour creates a de facto definition of criminal persistence as essentially a measure of continued crime over time. In this study, prior definitions of persistence are applied to a dataset of arrest information on 17, 685 juveniles released from California Youth Authority institutions between 1988 and 1998, and followed through 2003. Findings indicate that regardless of how persistence is defined, slightly varying samples of <b>persistent</b> <b>offenders</b> can be found within the same dataset. The findings support previous research in that this analysis reveals that even among a sample of <b>persistent</b> <b>offenders,</b> some percent of offenders account for a larger proportion of all arrest charges.

A sample of first-time arrestees aged under 12 (n = 192) was assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC-IV) parent-version on attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD). Based on child and parent reports of offending as obtained at arrest and at 2 -year follow-up, three groups of offenders were ifferentiated: (1) persistent high (n = 48), (2) occasional (n = 62), and (3) <b>persistent</b> low <b>offenders</b> (n = 82). Over one-third of the sample (33. 9 %) was diagnosed with an externalizing disorder, and 13. 5 % with both ADHD and ODDor CD. Higher levels of externalizing psychopathology distinguished <b>persistent</b> high <b>offenders</b> from occasional (comorbid ADHD and ODD/CD: OR 8. 2, CI 2. 6 - 25. 5) and <b>persistent</b> low <b>offenders</b> (comorbid ADHD and ODD/CD: OR 18. 2, CI 4. 6 - 72. 3; ADHD: OR 4. 1, CI 1. 3 - 13. 0), overand above socio-demographic and first offense characteristics.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. It first {{appeared}} from SAGE via [URL] this article, we analyze the relationship between social disadvantage and crime, starting from the paradox that most <b>persistent</b> <b>offenders</b> come from disadvantaged backgrounds, but most people from disadvantaged backgrounds do not become <b>persistent</b> <b>offenders.</b> We argue that despite the fact that social disadvantage has been a key criminological topic for some time, the mechanisms which link it to offending remain poorly specified. Drawing on situational action theory, we suggest social disadvantage is linked to crime because more people from disadvantaged versus affluent backgrounds develop a high crime propensity and are exposed to criminogenic contexts, and the reason for this is that processes of social and self-selection place the former more frequently in (developmental and action) contexts conducive to the development and expression of high crime propensities. This article will explore this hypothesis through a series of analyses using data from the Peterborough Adolescent and Young Adult Development Study (PADS+), a longitudinal study which uses a range of data collection methods to study the interaction between personal characteristics and social environments. It pays particular attention to the macro-to-micro processes behind the intersection of people with certain characteristics and environments with certain features – i. e., their exposure – which leads to their interaction.
