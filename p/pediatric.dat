5|$|Several {{studies of}} diets {{supplemented}} with MFGM and its components, including gangliosides and sphingomyelin, {{have aimed to}} address measures of cognitive development in <b>pediatric</b> populations. In some of the studies, MFGM supplementation to infant formula was shown to narrow the gap in cognitive development between breastfed and formula-fed infants.|$|E
5|$|There are {{significant}} differences in airway anatomy and respiratory physiology between children and adults, and these are taken into careful consideration before performing tracheal intubation of any <b>pediatric</b> patient. The differences, which are quite significant in infants, gradually disappear as the human body approaches a mature age and body mass index.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} {{intersex}} surgery is {{intertwined with the}} development of the specialities of <b>pediatric</b> surgery, <b>pediatric</b> urology, and <b>pediatric</b> endocrinology, with our increasingly refined understanding of sexual differentiation, {{with the development of}} political advocacy groups united by a human qualified analysis, and in the last decade by doubts as to efficacy, and controversy over when and even whether some procedures should be performed.|$|E
25|$|Children with Kawasaki disease {{should be}} hospitalized {{and cared for}} by a {{physician}} who has experience with this disease. When in an academic medical center, care is often shared between <b>pediatric</b> cardiology, <b>pediatric</b> rheumatology, and <b>pediatric</b> infectious disease specialists (although no specific infectious agent {{has been identified as}} yet). Treatment should be started as soon as the diagnosis is made to prevent damage to the coronary arteries.|$|E

Adult craniofacial surgery deals mostly with fractures and secondary surgeries (such as orbital reconstruction) along with orthognathic surgery. Craniofacial surgery {{is an important part}} of all plastic surgery training programs, further training and subspecialisation is obtained via a craniofacial fellowship. Craniofacial surgery is also practiced by Maxillo-Facial surgeons.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} faced by <b>pediatric</b> safety and quality efforts {{is that most of}} the work on patient safety to date has focused on adult patients. In addition, there is no standard nomenclature for <b>pediatric</b> patient safety that is widely used. However, a standard framework for classifying <b>pediatric</b> adverse events that offers flexibility has been introduced. Standardization provides consistency between interdisciplinary teams and can facilitate multisite studies. If these large-scale studies are conducted, the findings could generate large-scale intervention studies conducted with a faster life cycle.|$|E
