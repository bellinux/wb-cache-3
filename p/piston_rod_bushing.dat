It will produce great vibration. Sometimes the vibration {{is higher than}} the natural frequency of <b>piston</b> <b>rod.</b> This will lead to the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> failure in small engine. Situation which vibration frequency exceeding natural frequency is known as resonance. Finite element analysis and experimental modal analysis are two methods to investigate the dynamic behavior of <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> and thus determining its natural frequency.

30|$|In a servo cylinder, the radial {{component}} of a partial load on the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> causes {{the front end of}} the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> to deflect downward relative to the center of mass. This breaks the oil seal between the support oil pad and counter oil pad, and changes the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> gap, which affects the pressure in the oil chamber of each oil pad. When the radial force increases, based on the centroid location, the gap between the oil seal edges of the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> bearing oil cushion and counter oil cushion decreases with increasing deflection of the <b>piston</b> <b>rod.</b> Because the system has a constant-pressure oil supply, under the joint action of hole damping and oil edge sealing, the oil chamber experiences a pressing force. This causes the oil pressure in the upper and lower oil pads of the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> to increase, resulting in a larger reaction force. This increased force counteracts the radial force of the eccentric load to balance the partial load. As the movement of the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> changes during operation, the radial force generated by the eccentric load also changes dynamically. The gap between the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> and oil seal changes correspondingly under the effects of fluid-solid coupling. The pressure in the oil chambers in the upper and lower oil pads then makes the necessary adjustments so the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> can be adaptively aligned in the guide sleeve.|$|R

50|$|Before {{reassembling}} all {{the parts}} of your cylinder, you should clean and dry the cylinder barrel completely.

40|$|In this paper, {{dynamic loads}} {{acting on a}} {{twin-tube}} hydraulic shock absorber are derived out both in wheel and axle planes by modeling mechanically car rear suspensions, and internal and external forces that yield lateral surface damage and wear-out of the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> for the absorber are analyzed according to bench and real road test measures.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a pneumatic/hydraulic operated cylinder composed of several cylinder modules arranged in succession in the axial direction, {{each of which}} guidess a piston which {{has at least one}} <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> set {{to one side of the}} piston, whereby the front cylinder module has an opening at its front end face permitting the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> to pass through, and in said opening the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> extendable out of the cylinder at said face side and connected to the piston of the front cylinder module is guided, each cylinder module, with the exception of the rear, end-side closed cylinder module, having a <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> passage opening for the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> and its rear end face, said <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> being connected to the piston guided in the next cylinder module, and whereby each cylinder module is provided with an inlet and outlet for the hydraulic/pneumatic medium at least in the area of its rear end face and in the area of the front end face. The task of specifying a cylinder which permits more tha n two defined positions of the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> such as the known multiposition cylinder, but in comparison having a simple and compact design, is characterized by the fact that, according to the solution provided by the invention, the cylinder modules (1, 2, 3, 4) in the cylinders of the type described above are designed so that the maximum possible piston stroke length in the rearmost [...] ...|$|R

Supporting carriers (6, 7) {{are attached to}} the head and the lug. The carriers extend axially along a centre axis (X) to each other, and variably spaced with their strikings (8, 9) to each other, so that a gap (11) is formed, which is bridged by a force storage unit (12) ...|$|R
50|$|Later developments, also by Watt, {{produced}} a double-acting cylinder. The <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> {{now had to}} transmit a force alternately pushing and pulling. The steam engine's general use of an enclosed cylinder, nearly always double-acting, made it dependent on the stuffing box and so the <b>piston</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|R
30|$|During servo operation, the <b>piston</b> and <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> are {{subjected}} to gravity and partial loading from unbalanced radial components. This force can be adjusted within a certain range using the force generated by pressure changes in the oil chambers of {{the upper and lower}} oil pads, which result from changes in the gap between the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> and seal oil edge. This ensures that the <b>piston</b> <b>rod,</b> guide sleeve, and cylinder maintain gaps in an appropriate range to facilitate oil film lubrication and reduce friction between the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> and guide sleeve, and piston and cylinder. This results in increased system load-bearing capacity and anti-eccentric load capacity, as well as wear-free operation over wide speed and load ranges, which significantly increases the reliability and longevity of horizontal hydraulic cylinders.|$|R

50|$|A {{hydraulic}} cylinder without a piston {{or with a}} piston without seals is called a plunger cylinder. A plunger cylinder can only {{be used as a}} pushing cylinder; the maximum force is <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> area multiplied by pressure. This means that a plunger cylinder in general has a relatively thick <b>piston</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|R
50|$|Watt's {{development}} of the steam engine introduced an enclosed upper cylinder. This now required a stuffing box to seal around the <b>piston</b> <b>rod,</b> and for the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> to be machined smooth and accurately cylindrical. The engines were still single-acting at this time and the rod was still only acting in tension.|$|R
50|$|More {{sophisticated}} cylinders have a {{body with}} end cover, a <b>piston</b> <b>rod,</b> and a cylinder head. At one side the bottom is, for instance, connected to a single clevis, whereas at the other side, the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> is also foreseen with a single clevis. The cylinder shell normally has hydraulic connections at both sides; that is, a connection at the bottom side and a connection at the cylinder head side. If oil is pushed under the <b>piston,</b> the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> is pushed out and oil that was between the piston and the cylinder head is pushed back to the oil tank.|$|R
50|$|The <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> is {{typically}} a hard chrome-plated piece of cold-rolled steel which {{attaches to the}} piston and extends from the cylinder through the rod-end head. In double rod-end cylinders, the actuator has a rod extending {{from both sides of}} the piston and out both ends of the barrel. The <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> connects the hydraulic actuator to the machine component doing the work. This connection can be in the form of a machine thread or a mounting attachment. The <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> is highly ground and polished so as to provide a reliable seal and prevent leakage.|$|R
5000|$|... === Steeple engines === Steeple engines {{place the}} {{crankshaft}} above the cylinder, {{between it and}} the crosshead. They use paired <b>piston</b> <b>rods,</b> two or even four, from the piston to the crosshead, to avoid the crankshaft. Another pattern used a triangular yoke on the single <b>piston</b> <b>rod,</b> allowing the crankshaft to pass through it.|$|R
5000|$|The trunk {{engine was}} largely {{replaced}} by the double piston-rod engine. [...] This was a return connecting rod engine, with the crankshaft between the crosshead and cylinder. Four <b>piston</b> <b>rods</b> were used to pass around the crankshaft, both above and below, and also to {{each side of the}} crank, as the crank throw was wider than the vertical spacing of the <b>piston</b> <b>rods.</b> As most of these engines were parallel compounds, two <b>piston</b> <b>rods</b> would be taken from each of the HP and LP pistons. In some engines, double rods were used from the large LP cylinder and a single rod from the HP cylinder, with a yoke to pass around the crankshaft. Double <b>piston</b> <b>rods</b> could also be used from a simple engine, but these required an overhung gudgeon pin on the crosshead, so tended to be limited to smaller engines. An advantage of the double <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> engine over the trunk was that both ends of the connecting rod were accessible for maintenance. One factor learned from naval use of horizontal cylinders was that, despite previous fears, there was little additional wear owing to the piston's weight resting on the cylinder.|$|R
2500|$|Each engine had {{a single}} piston which {{measured}} 12 inches on the inside bore, and drove a <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> with a stroke of 48 inches. [...] Each <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> in turn drove a 16-foot-long iron rod called a pitman arm which turned a crank pin on the sternwheel. [...] The sternwheel itself was 15 feet in diameter.|$|R
50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines, and {{in particular}} all current automobile engines, do not generally have <b>piston</b> <b>rods.</b> Instead they use trunk pistons, where the piston and crosshead are combined and so do not need a rod between them. The term <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> {{has been used as}} a synonym for 'connecting rod' in the context of these engines.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the later}} steam engines, the {{high-speed}} steam engines, used single-acting pistons of a new design. The crosshead {{became part of the}} piston, and there was no longer any <b>piston</b> <b>rod.</b> This was for similar reasons to the internal combustion engine, as avoiding the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> and its seals allowed a more effective crankcase lubrication system.|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic {{cylinders}} {{get their}} power from pressurized hydraulic fluid, which is typically oil. The hydraulic cylinder {{consists of a}} cylinder barrel, in which a piston connected to a <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> moves back and forth. The barrel is closed on one end by the cylinder bottom (also called the cap) and the other end by the cylinder head (also called the gland) where the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> {{comes out of the}} cylinder. The piston has sliding rings and seals. The piston divides the inside of the cylinder into two chambers, the bottom chamber (cap end) and the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> side chamber (rod end / head end).|$|R
40|$|Pressure {{regulators}} in {{the field}} of pneumatic mechanisms can be used as valves for saving compressed air. For example {{it can be used to}} reduce the pressure when the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> is retracting unloaded and thus it is possible to save some energy. However the problem is that saving valve can significantly affect the dynamics of the pneumatic system. The lower pressure in the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> chamber causes extension of time for retraction of the <b>piston</b> <b>rod.</b> This article compare the air consumption experimentally determined and calculated, measured curves of pressure in cylinder chambers and piston speed when saving valve is set up differently...|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} Watt's linkage {{can be found}} on the high and {{intermediate}} pressure <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> of the 1865 Crossness engines. In these engines, the low pressure <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> uses the more conventional parallel motion linkage, but the high and intermediate pressure rod does not connect to the end of the beam so there is no requirement to save space.|$|R
50|$|<b>Piston</b> <b>rods</b> {{are usually}} {{attached}} to the crosshead and the piston by a transverse slot and a tapered key or gib. Driving this key sideways tightens the attachment. Using a transverse key allows relatively easy dismantling for maintenance. Some smaller pistons are retained by a threaded <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> and a large nut, although the crosshead nearly always uses a key.|$|R
50|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} engine was its central spindle valve. This acted as a multi-stage piston valve, controlling admission of steam into each of the compound cylinders. Unusually the valve worked within the hollow <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> or trunk, {{rather than in the}} cylinder block or valvechest. This hollow <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> linked all of the cylinders and was machined with ports.|$|R
