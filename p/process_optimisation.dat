40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} for deploying and subsequently managing a virtual network overlay, which is tailored to an end-user’s request. Our approach combines a binary integer <b>optimisation</b> <b>process</b> {{to decide on}} the number and placement of virtual routers, and an autonomic network management system that subsequently manages the configuration of the running virtual network. High-level optimisation policies are used to guide the <b>optimisation</b> <b>process</b> to identify a virtual network that favours lower hosting costs or higher network quality (we use mean delays as a quality metric). Low-level deployment policies are generated and used to govern the deployment and management of the virtual networks.

In fact, the proposed methodology allows both to design new procedures of solvent replacement and to improve existing industrial processes.

50|$|To unleash the {{potential}} offered by modern ICT, Switzerland has {{put in a}} place a strategic framework to drive eGovernment efforts at federal, cantonal, and communal level. The country's main strategic document is eGovernment strategy Switzerland, adopted by the Federal Council on 24 January 2007. This strategy is aimed at reducing administrative burdens through <b>process</b> <b>optimisation,</b> standardisation, {{and the development of}} common solutions. These goals are being realised by means of prioritised projects, following a decentralised but co-ordinated implementation approach throughout all levels of government. In parallel to these efforts, the ICT Strategy 2007-2011 has been adopted on 27 November 2006, to guide the implementation of the eGovernment efforts at a federal level. This document defines a framework setting out relevant strategic objectives and the responsible authorities. In addition, a set of partial strategies has been also put in place to complement the General ICT strategy, placing emphasis on more specific areas. These strategies are presented in the Federal Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) 2008-2012 and the Open Source Software: Strategy of the Swiss federal administration document.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this master’s thesis is to determine methods for improving a company’s business processes without investing in new technology and whether a relatively small company can benefit from investing in technology. This study determines the meaning of <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> and {{how it should be}} conducted. Using existing theory and the case of a logistics company operating in Finland, this research attempts to identify hindrances and find opportunities for the company to develop their processes through <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> without technology. Different public bodies in Finland (such as the Finnish government and Statistics Finland) have stated that Finnish logistics requires development and have recommended new technology as a solution to the issue. However, the lack of information on the Finnish logistics business sector makes such statements by public bodies difficult to analyse. <b>Process</b> <b>optimisation</b> has been revealed to be more complex than expected. Many theories available today examine and recommend different technological solutions to execute companies’ work processes. However, a theory is needed on how <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> can be carried out at a company lacking technology. <b>Process</b> <b>optimisation</b> consists of process modelling and process analysis. Process modelling appears to be the most significant and crucial aspect of <b>process</b> <b>optimisation.</b> Order-to-delivery processes cannot be optimised within a company if the company does not understand the entirety of such processes. Knowledge of the process has been highlighted as being key to understanding a company’s processes at a high level. The case company in this study showed that <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> is possible without implementing new technology; instead, optimisation required additional human capital and a stronger focus on a company’s internal business processes. Technology-based solutions for <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> are tempting to implement as doing so may be believed to save time, but no automated solution is able to reveal a company’s critical information if the company does not know what it is looking for and cannot identify its problem areas. This research includes a single case study. The results indicate that whether a relatively small company could benefit from investing in technology is unclear, and the lack of research on <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> at Finnish companies resulted in limited findings and analysis. Several different scientific articles presented technology implementation successes and failures, but did not reveal information on the steps taken by the companies...|$|E

40|$|What is {{the impact}} of new design methodologies and methods on the {{industrial}} product development process and its productivity? This {{is one of the key}} questions for today's industrial engineering companies when they decide on the introduction of new methods or tools, as well as for researchers and tool providers when they assess their ideas and work. A quantitative (at best monetary) assessment of a new design method's value and impact will increase a manager's decision basis significantly and will lead to well directed investments in <b>process</b> <b>optimisations.</b> It is not sufficient to analyse the impact of a new design method just for the specific process step it is applied to. Implications on following steps, sometimes on the whole engineering process must be considered as well.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{creation}} of diffusion layers by the slurry coating method using Al and Zn powders on AZ 31 and AZ 91. The method was applied at 450 °C, 420 °C and 380 °C in an Ar/H_ 2. Secondary electron microscopy, backscattered electron microscopy, {{energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy}} (EDX) and potentio dynamic measurements were used to classify the diffusion layers. Diffusion coatings were successfully produced at a temperature of 450 °C for a Zn slurry and a mixed Al-Zn slurry. These diffusion layers were in general rich on zinc and several hundred μ m thick. Electrochemical measurements showed that E_corr became more anodic by a zinc rich diffusion layer, but i_corr did not change. All in all, it could be shown that diffusion layers could be produced by the slurry coatings method for Zn and Al-Zn slurries and opportunities for further <b>process</b> <b>optimisations</b> addressed...|$|R

40|$|Alloyed MCrAlY bond coats, where M {{is usually}} cobalt and/or nickel, are {{essential}} parts of modern turbine blades, imparting environmental resistance while mediating thermal expansivity differences. Nanoindentation allows {{the determination of}} their properties without the complexities of traditional mechanical tests, but was not previously possible near turbine operating temperatures. Here, we determine the hardness and modulus of CMSX- 4 and an Amdry- 386 bond coat by nanoindentation up to 1000 ^∘C. Both materials exhibit a constant hardness until 400 ^∘C followed by considerable softening, which in CMSX- 4 is attributed to the multiple slip systems operating underneath a Berkovich indenter. The creep behaviour has been investigated via the nanoindentation hold segments. Above 700 ^∘C, the observed creep exponents match the temperature-dependence of literature values in CMSX- 4. In Amdry- 386, nanoindentation produces creep exponents very close to literature data, implying high-temperature nanoindentation may be powerful in characterising these coatings and providing inputs for material, model and <b>process</b> <b>optimisations...</b>|$|R
