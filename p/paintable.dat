2500|$|Of Olga's beauty, British novelist George Moore was unimpressed. As {{he commented}} to an admiring artist friend, [...] "By Jove, you're all after the girl, a fine Mélisande for the stage, with her {{beautiful}} hair {{down to her}} heels. She's <b>paintable,</b> I admit, but as to one's daily use, I should rather have the mother than the child. Too slender for me ... you know my tastes." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm sure Lawson {{would love}} that green skin of yours," [...] said Philip. [...] "He'd {{say it was}} so <b>paintable,</b> but I'm terribly matter of fact nowadays, and I shan't be happy till you're as pink and white as a milkmaid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me, my angels," [...] said mademoiselle, apostrophizing her {{pupils in}} the prettiest foreign English, [...] "am I {{the cream of}} all creams this morning? Do I carry my sixty years resplendently? Will the savages in India, when my own love {{exhibits}} my picture among them, say, 'Ah! smart! smart! {{this was a great}} dandy?' And the gentleman, the skillful artist, whom it is even more an honor than a happiness to meet, does he approve of me for a model? Does he find me pretty and <b>paintable</b> from top to toe?" [...] Here she dropped me another brisk courtesy, placed herself in a languishing position in the sitter's chair, and asked us all if she looked like a shepherdess in Dresden china.|$|E
60|$|When Philip {{returned}} to Amitrano's {{he found that}} Fanny Price was no longer working there. She had given up the key of her locker. He asked Mrs. Otter whether she knew {{what had become of}} her; and Mrs. Otter, with a shrug of the shoulders, answered that she had probably gone back to England. Philip was relieved. He was profoundly bored by her ill-temper. Moreover she insisted on advising him about his work, looked upon it as a slight when he did not follow her precepts, and would not understand that he felt himself no longer the duffer he had been at first. Soon he forgot all about her. He was working in oils now and he was full of enthusiasm. He hoped to have something done of sufficient importance to send to the following year's Salon. Lawson was painting a portrait of Miss Chalice. She was very <b>paintable,</b> and all the young men who had fallen victims to her charm had made portraits of her. A natural indolence, joined with a passion for picturesque attitude, made her an excellent sitter; and she had enough technical knowledge to offer useful criticisms. Since her passion for art was chiefly a passion to live the life of artists, she was quite content to neglect her own work. She liked the warmth of the studio, and the opportunity to smoke innumerable cigarettes; and she spoke in a low, pleasant voice of the love of art and the art of love. She made no clear distinction between the two.|$|E
60|$|Gabriel {{consented to}} sit; he professed he should enjoy {{it and be}} glad to give up for it his {{immediate}} foreign commerce, so vague to Nick, so definite apparently to himself; {{and he came back}} three times for the purpose. Nick promised himself a deal of interest from this experiment, for with the first hour of it he began to feel that really as yet, given the conditions under which he now studied him, he had never at all thoroughly explored his friend. His impression had been that Nash had a head quite fine enough to be a challenge, and that as he sat there day by day all sorts of pleasant and <b>paintable</b> things would come out in his face. This impression was not gainsaid, but the whole tangle grew denser. It struck our young man that he had never seen his subject before, and yet somehow this revelation was not produced by the sense of actually seeing it. What was revealed was the difficulty--what he saw was not the measurable mask but the ambiguous meaning. He had taken things for granted which literally were not there, and he found things there--except that he couldn't catch them--which he had not hitherto counted in or presumed to handle. This baffling effect, eminently in the line of the mystifying, so familiar to Nash, might have been the result of his whimsical volition, had it not appeared to our artist, after a few hours of the job, that his sitter was not the one who enjoyed it most. He was uncomfortable, at first vaguely and then definitely so--silent, restless, gloomy, dim, as if on the test the homage of a directer attention than he had ever had gave him less pleasure than he would have supposed. He had been willing to judge of this in good faith; but frankly he rather suffered. He wasn't cross, but was clearly unhappy, and Nick had never before felt him contract instead of expanding.|$|E
60|$|But as yet I {{wandered in}} the Forum {{safe from the}} {{realization}} of its ugliness when it was in its glory. I cannot say that even now it is picturesque, but it is <b>paintable,</b> and certainly it is pathetic. Stumps of columns, high and low, stand about in the places where they stood in their unbroken pride, and though it seems a hardship {{that they should not}} have been left lying in the kindly earth or on it instead of being pulled up and set on end, it must be owned that they are scarcely overworked in their present postures. More touching are those inarticulate heaps, cairns of sculptured fragments, piled here and there together and waiting the knowledge which is some time to assort them and translate them into some measure of coherent meaning. But it must always be remembered that when they were coherent they were only beautiful parts of a whole that was brutally unbeautiful. We have but to use the little common-sense which Heaven has vouchsafed some of us in order to realize that Rome, either republican or imperial, was a state for which we can have no genuine reverence, and that mostly the ruins of her past can stir in us no finer emotion than wonder. But necessarily, for the sake of knowledge, and of ascertaining just what quantity and quality of human interest the material records of Roman antiquity embody, archaeology must devote itself with all possible piety to their recovery. The removal, handful by handful, of the earth from the grave of the past which the whole Forum is, tomb upon tomb, is as dramatic a spectacle as anything one can well witness; for that soil is richer than any gold-mine in its potentiality of treasure, and it must be strictly scrutinized, almost by particles, lest some gem of art should be cast aside with the accumulated rubbish of centuries. Yet this drama, poignantly suggestive as it always must be, was the least incident of that morning in the Forum which it was my fortune to pass there with other better if not older tourists as guest of the Genius Loci. It was not quite a public event, though the Commendatore Boni is so well known to the higher journalism, and even to fiction (as the reader of Anatole France's La Pierre Blanche will not have forgotten), that nothing which he archaeologically does is without public interest, and this excursion in the domain of antiquity was expected to result in identifying the site of the Temple of Jupiter Stator. It was conjectured that the temple vowed to this specific Jupiter for his public spirit in stopping the flight of a highly demoralized Roman army would be found where we actually found it. Archaeology seems to proceed by hypothesis, like other sciences, and to enjoy a forecast of events before they are actually accomplished. I do not say that I was very vividly aware of the event in question; I could not go now and show where the temple stood, but when I read of it in a cablegram to the American newspapers I almost felt that I had dug it up with my own hands.|$|E
60|$|At {{a corner}} of a street, some rich men had got {{together}} and left unguarded all the gold, diamonds, and rubies of the East; but when you came near you saw that this treasure was only a gathering of goldfish in glass globes--yellow, white, and red fish, with from three to five forked tails apiece and eyes that bulged far beyond their heads. There were wooden pans full of tiny ruby fish, and little children with nets dabbled and shrieked in chase of some special beauty, and the frightened fish kicked up showers of little pearls with their tails. The children carried lanterns {{in the shape of}} small red paper fish bobbing at the end of slivers of bamboo, and these drifted through the crowd like a strayed constellation of baby stars. When the children {{stood at the edge of}} a canal and called down to unseen friends in boats the pink lights were all reflected orderly below. The light of the thousand small lights in the street went straight up into the darkness among the interlacing telegraph wires, and just at the edge of the shining haze, on a sort of pigeon-trap, forty feet above ground, sat a Japanese fireman, wrapped up in his cloak, keeping watch against fires. He looked unpleasantly like a Bulgarian atrocity or a Burmese 'deviation from the laws of humanity,' being very still and all huddled up in his roost. That was a superb picture and it arranged itself to admiration. Now, disregarding these things and others--wonders and miracles all--men are content to sit in studios and, by light that is not light, to fake subjects from pots and pans and rags and bricks that are called 'pieces of colour.' Their collection of rubbish costs in the end quite as much as a ticket, a first-class one, to new worlds where the 'props' are given away with the sunshine. To do anything because it is, or may not be, new on the market is wickedness that carries its own punishment; but surely there must be things in this world <b>paintable</b> other and beyond those that lie between the North Cape, say, and Algiers. For the sake of the pictures, putting aside the dear delight of the gamble, it might be worth while to venture out a little beyond the regular circle of subjects and--see what happens. If a man can draw one thing, it has been said, he can draw anything. At the most he can but fail, and there are several matters in the world worse than failure. Betting on a certainty, for instance, or playing with nicked cards is immoral, and secures expulsion from clubs. Keeping deliberately to one set line of work because you know you can do it and are certain to get money by so doing is, on the other hand, counted a virtue, and secures admission to clubs. There must be a middle way somewhere, as there must be somewhere an unmarried man with no position, reputation, or other vanity to lose, who most keenly wants to find out what his palette is set for in this life. He will pack his steamer-trunk and get into the open to wrestle with effects that he can never reproduce. All the same his will be a superb failure.|$|E

The first series of comics in 1984 was plotted by Jack Kirby, who also provided covers, {{who went on to}} pencil the second series. The third and final series was penciled by Carmine Infantino. These comics were separate from the continuity of the regular comics featuring the characters. Hanna Barbera also produced two animated series (a refreshing of the venerable Super Friends concept), called Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show and The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians. Warner Home Video used the opportunity to issue episodes of Superman, Batman, Superboy, and Aquaman produced by Filmation in 1966 on VHS and Betamax video cassette in 1985 under the Super Powers label (and also as part of the 50th anniversary celebrations of their sister company DC Comics), reissuing them again on VHS in 1996 (and were still available into the early 2000s {{until the end of the}} VHS format).

30|$|This {{research}} work {{showed that the}} surface wettability of MDF panels was significantly affected by the digester conditions, defibrator disc distance, and the wood species. The wettability of the MDF decreased with increasing the defibrator disc distance. At the same digestion conditions and defibrator disc distance, the highest wettability (the lowest contact angle) {{was found in the}} MDF specimens produced with beech wood, followed by poplar wood, birch wood, scots pine/beech wood, and scots pine wood, respectively. The increment in the severity of the digestion conditions improved the wettability of the specimens, which resulted in a decrement in the contact angle values. The better wettability of MDF panels would contribute to the improvement of the bondability between MDF panel and water-soluble UF resin, thus to improved performances of the products. The findings of the present study can be also used by the MDF manufacturers, which produce <b>paintable</b> MDF panel for furniture industry.|$|E

40|$|Programmable {{matter is}} a {{proposed}} digital material having computation, sensing, actuation, and display as continuous properties active over its whole extent. Programmable matter would have many exciting applications, like <b>paintable</b> displays, shape-changing robots and tools, rapid prototyping, and sculpture-based haptic interfaces. Programmable matter would {{be composed of}} millimeter-scale autonomous microsystem particles, without internal moving parts, bound by electromagnetic forces or an adhesive binder. Particles can dissipate 10 mW heat, and store 6 J energy in an internal zinc-air battery. Photovoltaic cells provide 300 [mu]W outdoors and 3. 0 [mu]W indoors. Painted systems can store battery reactants in the paint binder; 6 J / mm 3 can be stored, and diffusion is fast enough to transport reactants to the particles. Capacitive power transfer is an efficient method to transfer power to sparse, randomly placed particles. Power from capacitive transfer is proportional to VDD 2 : 100 [mu]W at 3. 3 V and 12 mW at 35 V. Inter-particle communication is possible via optical, near-field, and far-field electromagnetic systems. Optical systems allow communication with low area (sub-mm) particles, and 24 pJ/bit. Near-field electromagnetic gives precisely controlled neighborhoods, localization capability, and 37 pJ/bit. Far-field radio communication between widely spaced particles may be possible at 60 GHz; antennas that fit inside 1 mm 3 exist; complete transceivers do not. A 32 -bit CPU uses less than 0. 26 mm 2 die area, 256 K x 8 SRAM uses 1. 1 mm 2, and 256 K x 8 FLASH uses 0. 32 mm 2. Direct-drive electric and magnetic field systems allow actuation without moving parts inside the particles. Magnetic surface-drive motors designed for operation without bearings are not power-efficient, and parasitic interactions between permanent magnets may limit their usefulness at millimeter particle dimensions. Electrostatic surface-drive motors are power-efficient, but practical only at particle dimensions below a few millimeters. We constructed a prototype <b>paintable</b> display; a distributed PostScript rendering system with 1000 randomly-placed 3. 4 cm nodes, each with a CPU, IR communications, and LED. The system is used to render the letter "A. " We present a design, not yet constructed, for a literal <b>paintable</b> display, with 1. 0 mm rendering particles, each with a microprocessor and memory, and 110 [mu]m display particles, with tri-color LED's and simpler circuitry. Storage of zinc-air battery reactants in the paint binder would provide an 8 hour battery life, and capacitive power distribution would allow continuous operation. We constructed a prototype sliding-cube modular robot, with 3. 4 cm nodes. The system uses magnetic surface-drive actuation. We demonstrate horizontal lattice-unit translation. We describe a design, not yet constructed, for a sliding-cube modular robot with 2 mm nodes. The cubes use standard-process CMOS IC's, inserted into a cubic space frame and wire-bonded together. Arrays of passivated electrodes, 1 [mu]m {{from the surface of}} the cubes, are used for electrostatic surface-drive actuation, zero-power latching, power transfer, localization, and communication. The design allows actuation from any contacting position. Energy is stored in a standard SMT capacitor inside each node, which is recharged by power transfer through chains of contacting nodes. by Ara N. Knaian. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Batteries {{have become}} {{fundamental}} {{building blocks for}} the mobility of modern society. Continuous development of novel battery chemistries and electrode materials has nourished progress in building better batteries. Simultaneously, novel device form factors and designs with multi-functional components have been proposed, requiring batteries to not only integrate seamlessly to these devices, but to also be a multi-functional component for a multitude of applications. Thus, in the past decade, along with developments in the component materials, the focus has been shifting more and more towards novel fabrication processes, unconventional configurations, and additional functionalities. This work attempts to critically review the developments with respect to emerging electrochemical energy storage configurations, including, amongst others, <b>paintable,</b> transparent, flexible, wire or cable shaped, ultra-thin and ultra-thick configurations, as well as hybrid energy storage-conversion, or graphene-incorporated batteries and supercapacitors. The performance requirements are elaborated together with the advantages, but also the limitations, with respect to established electrochemical energy storage technologies. Finally, challenges in developing novel materials with tailored properties that would allow such configurations, and in designing easier manufacturing techniques that can be widely adopted are considered...|$|E
