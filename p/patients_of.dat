While Bentley researches a cure of the sleepers' comas, Sandy and Sunnie acquaint themselves with the other <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> Walnut Manor and ultimately fall in love with one another.|$|E
5|$|Greenlandic is an ergative language. This means that, {{instead of}} {{treating}} the grammatical relations {{as in most}} European languages where grammatical subjects are marked with nominative case and objects with accusative, the grammatical roles are defined differently. In Greenlandic the ergative case is used for agents of transitive verbs and for possessors. Absolutive case is used for <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs. Research into Greenlandic as used by the younger generation {{has shown that the}} use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into a nominative–accusative language.|$|E

Leprosy treatment {{is very important to}} eliminate cases of leprosy because leprosy can be cured by taking medication regularly. If <b>patient</b> <b>of</b> leprosy take medication irregularly, leprosy bacteria can become resistant, so the symptoms will be persisted and even worse. This study was aimed to analyze the factors related with compliance of taking medicine by <b>patient</b> <b>of</b> leprosy in Disctrict Pragaan Sumenep. This study used cross sectional approach. The number of sample in this study were 40 patients who were taken with simple random sampling. Chi-square test in Statcalc of epi-info was used to know the relation between independent variables and dependent variable with (α = 0, 05). Based on study result, there was asscociation between knowledge about leprosy with compliance <b>of</b> taking medicineby <b>patient</b> <b>of</b> leprosy (p = 0, 012)). There was association between family support with compliance <b>of</b> taking medicineby <b>patient</b> <b>of</b> leprosy (p = 0, 003). There was association between stigma with compliance <b>of</b> taking medicineby <b>patient</b> <b>of</b> leprosy (p = 0, 000). There was association between the role of health workers with compliance <b>of</b> taking medicineby <b>patient</b> <b>of</b> leprosy (p = 0, 014). There was asscociation between availabiliy of MDT with compliance <b>of</b> taking medicineby <b>patient</b> <b>of</b> leprosy (p = 0, 006). The conclusion of this study was knowledge about leprosy, family support, stigma, availability of MDT were factors that related with compliance <b>of</b> taking medicineby <b>patient</b> <b>of</b> leprosy. Effective socialization will give patient motivations to be obedient of taking medicine. Keywords: compliance, leprosy, multi drug therapy...|$|R
5|$|In 1935 Reich {{bought an}} {{oscillograph}} and attached it {{to friends and}} students, who volunteered to touch and kiss each other while Reich read the tracings. One of the volunteers was a young Willy Brandt, the future chancellor of Germany. At the time, {{he was married to}} Reich's secretary, Gertrude Gaasland, and was living in Norway to organize protests against the Nazis. Reich also took measurements from the <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> a psychiatric hospital near Oslo, including catatonic patients, with the permission of the hospital's director. Reich described the oscillograph experiments in 1937 in Experimentelle Ergebniße Über Die Elektrische Funktion von Sexualität und Angst (The Bioelectrical Investigation of Sexuality and Anxiety).|$|E
5|$|In <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> normal intelligence, {{rumination}} is not {{an intentional}} behavior and is habitually reversed using diaphragmatic breathing to counter the urge to regurgitate. Alongside reassurance, explanation and habit reversal, patients are shown how to breathe using their diaphragms prior to and during the normal rumination period. A similar breathing pattern {{can be used to}} prevent normal vomiting. Breathing in this method works by physically preventing the abdominal contractions required to expel stomach contents.|$|E
5|$|Should {{a patient}} be {{transferred}} to an assisted living facility, nursing home, or hospital, the hospice would continue to provide care to the patient which is on par with the services provided under the routine home care benefit. In this way, {{the only difference between}} respite and routine care is that the hospice pays the room and board charges of the facility. Should a patient receive respite in an inpatient hospice unit the care would be similar to what other <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> the hospice unit receive. Respite is provided for a maximum of five days every benefit period.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} risk {{and severity of}} serotonergic side effects and serotonin toxicity, with individual drugs and combinations, is complex. Serotonin syndrome {{has been reported in}} <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> all ages, including the elderly, children, and even newborn infants due to in utero exposure. The serotonergic toxicity of SSRIs increases with dose, but even in over-dose it is insufficient to cause fatalities from serotonin syndrome in healthy adults. Elevations of central nervous system serotonin will typically only reach potentially fatal levels when drugs with different mechanisms of action are mixed together. Various drugs, other than SSRIs, also have clinically significant potency as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, (e.g. tramadol, amphetamine, and MDMA) and are associated with severe cases of the syndrome.|$|E

5|$|Commissioner Gordon informs Batman {{that the}} <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> Arkham Asylum {{have taken over}} the facility, {{threatening}} to murder the staff unless Batman agrees to meet with them. Among the hostages are Dr. Charles Cavendish, Arkham's administrator, and Dr. Ruth Adams, a therapist. The patients are led by the Joker, who threatens to kill a young girl to spur Batman {{to come to the}} asylum. Meanwhile, Two-Face's mental condition has deteriorated as a result of Adams' therapy; she replaced Two-Face's trademark coin with a six-sided die then a tarot deck, in each instance increasing the number of choices he has (as opposed to two choices from his original coin) in the hope that he will eventually not leave any of his choices up to chance. Instead, the treatment renders him incapable of even making simple decisions, such as going to the bathroom.|$|E

5|$|During this session, the Native Hawaiian legislators {{attempted}} to pass new {{laws in the}} interest of the local people, who included Hawaiian taro farmers, <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> the Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement and victims of the 1900 Chinatown fire, among others. In total, fifty-one bills were introduced in the Senate and one hundred and twenty-six in the House, although only nineteen bills were submitted by both houses for ratification. They proposed creating a governmentally funded education program for poor Hawaiian students similar to the Education of Hawaiian Youths Abroad program initiated during the reign of King Kalākaua. A pension for the deposed Queen Lili‘uokalani and appropriation to repair the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii were also proposed. They promoted the use and study of the Hawaiian language, especially in the government and courts. Ignoring the Organic Act which mandated the sole use of English in the legislature, this session was conducted in both Hawaiian and English with the aid of an interpreter. Many of the territorial legislators in this session did not speak English. They also created the first county bill, which would have created five counties named after former Hawaiian aliʻi.|$|E
5|$|Ferraro {{had felt}} unusually tired {{at the end}} of her second senate campaign. In , she was {{diagnosed}} with multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer where plasma cells secrete abnormal antibodies known as Bence-Jones proteins, which can cause bones to disintegrate and dump toxic amounts of calcium into the bloodstream. She did not publicly disclose the illness until , when she went to Washington to successfully press in Congressional hearings for passage of the Hematological Cancer Research Investment and Education Act. A portion of the Act created the Geraldine Ferraro Cancer Education Program, which directs the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an education program for <b>patients</b> <b>of</b> blood cancers and the general public. Ferraro became a frequent speaker on the disease, and an avid supporter and honorary board member of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.|$|E
