5|$|A. Bjarne Riis has {{admitted}} to doping during the 1996 Tour de France. The {{organizers of the}} Tour de France have stated {{that they no longer}} consider him to be the winner, although Union Cycliste Internationale has so far refused to change the official status due to the amount of time <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> his win. Jan Ullrich was placed second on the podium in Paris.|$|E

5|$|Hundreds {{of years}} later, Yune and Ashera combine to again become the goddess Ashunera, creator of Tellius. Lehran informs the newly risen goddess that, while three centuries (twelve since Ashunera was last whole) have <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the Wars of the Radiant Dawn, {{the nations of}} Tellius are once again {{preparing}} to go to war.|$|E

5|$|After an {{hour and}} a half had gone (and twenty minutes had <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the second attack) the Indonesians {{launched}} a third and final attack up the slope towards the base, which the British responded to with artillery and grenade fire. This defence was remarkably effective, and eventually the barrage of Indonesian rocket fire halted and the few remaining British soldiers rose from their hideouts and began to clear the perimeter. Soon afterwards, Gurkha soldiers and medical staff arrived at the base by helicopter, leaving the soldiers behind to secure the area and airlifting the wounded to a nearby hospital. By this point, however, Indonesian forces had withdrawn, effectively ending the battle.|$|E
5|$|By April 2010 {{almost five}} years had <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the {{previous}} general election (held on 5 May 2005), requiring a fresh election to take place. On 6 April 2010 Brown went to Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen to dissolve Parliament on 12 April {{in preparation for a}} general election. In a live press conference at Downing Street, Brown announced the election would be held on 6 May. The time between the announcement of the election and the dissolution of Parliament, known as wash-up, was to allow for the handling of any unfinished legislative business before the Parliamentary session's conclusion.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} January 1945, {{the highly}} {{purified}} plutonium underwent further concentration in the completed chemical isolation building, where remaining impurities were removed successfully. Los Alamos received its first plutonium from Hanford on February 2. While it was still by no means clear that enough plutonium could be produced for use in bombs by the war's end, Hanford was by early 1945 in operation. Only two years had <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> Col. Franklin Matthias first set up his temporary headquarters {{on the banks of}} the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|Dietrich's other {{argument}} {{was that the}} trial judge should have used discretionary powers and granted an adjournment until Dietrich was able to provide counsel himself, and that the {{failure to do so}} caused a miscarriage of justice. Dietrich had asked the trial judge for an adjournment during the trial, but the judge said that since more than a year had <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the offence occurred, it was {{in the interests of the}} community that the matter be dealt with promptly.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, having {{arranged}} for a private investigation of Hendrix's death, Etchingham supplied {{the results of the}} effort to UK authorities and requested they reopen the coroner's inquest. After a several-month inquiry by Scotland Yard, during which every interested party to the events was interviewed, officials were confident the request would be granted. The investigation eventually proved inconclusive in 1993, when Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell decided that proceeding with the investigation would not serve the public, {{due in part to the}} excessive time that had <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> Hendrix's death.|$|E

5|$|In April 1958, Eisenhower asked Congress for {{legislation}} {{to overhaul the}} Department of Defense. Over a decade had <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the legislation which had established it, and {{he was concerned about}} the degree of inter-service rivalry, duplication and mismanagement that was evident in many programs. In ballistic missile development, the Soviet Sputnik program had demonstrated that country's technological lead over the United States. The Army and Air Force had rival programs, PGM-19 Jupiter and PGM-17 Thor respectively, and the additional cost to the taxpayers of developing two systems instead of one was estimated at $500million.|$|E
5|$|More {{than twenty}} years had <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> Dave Guard had left the group, but {{residual}} tension surfaced between Guard and Shane {{in an article in}} The Wall Street Journal that appeared in March 1982 following the national broadcast of the taped show. Guard implicitly disparaged Shane's current group, and Shane asserted a distaste for performing again with Guard, who had spent the intervening decades living and performing in Australia, touring sporadically as a soloist, and writing about and teaching music. Despite the unpleasantness, Shane and Guard reconciled to a large degree (even to the point of planning a possible reunion tour) prior to Guard's death at age 56 from lymphoma nine years later in March 1991.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor {{wrote that}} there had been a {{hardening}} of police attitudes, with officers believing that proportionality meant reciprocity. The deployment of officers in riot gear had become a routine response to lawful protest, largely the result of an ignorance of the law and a lack of leadership from the Home Office and police chiefs. Officers were being trained to use their riot shields as weapons. Police forces across the country differed in their training, the equipment they had access to, and their understanding of the law. The failure to understand the relevant legislation was in part due to its complexity, the report said, with 90 amendments to the Public Order Act <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> 1986.|$|E

5|$|Only minute {{traces of}} {{technetium}} occur naturally in the Earth's crust. This is because technetium-98's half-life is only 4.2millionyears. More {{than a thousand}} of such periods have <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> {{the formation of the}} Earth, so the probability for the survival of even one atom of primordial technetium is effectively zero. However, small amounts exist as spontaneous fission products in uranium ores. A kilogram of uranium contains an estimated 1nanogram (10−9g) of technetium. Some red giant stars with the spectral types S-, M-, and N contain a spectral absorption line indicating the presence of technetium. These red-giants are known informally as technetium stars.|$|E
5|$|Since all {{isotopes}} of neptunium have half-lives {{that are}} many times {{shorter than the}} age of the Earth, any primordial neptunium should have decayed by now. After only about 80 million years, the concentration of even the longest lived isotope, 237Np, would have been reduced to less than one-trillionth (10−12) of its original amount; and even if the whole Earth had initially been made of pure 237Np (and ignoring that this would be well over its critical mass of 60kg), 2100 half-lives would have <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the formation of the Solar System, and thus all of it would have decayed. Thus neptunium is present in nature only in negligible amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the month}} of May the radio scintillations became less {{noticeable}} until they ceased altogether. This implies that the radio source significantly expanded {{in the time that}} had <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the burst was detected. Using the known distance to the source and the elapsed time before the scintillation ended, Frail calculated that the radio source had expanded at almost the speed of light. While various existing models already encompassed the notion of a relativistically expanding fireball, this was the first strong evidence to support such a model.|$|E

5|$|A Song of Ice and Fire {{takes place}} in a fictional world in which seasons last for years and end unpredictably. Nearly three centuries before the events of the first novel (see backstory), the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros were united under the Targaryen dynasty by Aegon I and his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys, with Aegon Targaryen {{becoming}} the first king of the whole of the continent of Westeros, save for the southerly Dorne. At the beginning of A Game of Thrones, 15 peaceful years have <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the rebellion led by Robert Baratheon deposed and killed the last Targaryen king, Aerys II, and proclaimed Robert king of the Seven Kingdoms, with a nine year long summer coming to an end.|$|E
5|$|As Brazil {{had been}} pacified {{after the end}} of the last {{rebellion}} (the Praieira revolt), Brazil's government turned its attention to the growing tensions with its neighbor to the south, the Argentine Confederation. Paulino Soares, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, decided to forge alliances with Uruguay and Paraguay, nations which also saw a threat in the ambitions of Juan Manuel de Rosas, dictator of the Argentine Confederation. An army commanded by Caxias crossed into Uruguay in September 1851. More than a year had <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> Honório Hermeto returned from Pernambuco, when he was named by Paulino Soares as special minister plenipotentiary in the Plata region. On 12 October 1851, Honório Hermeto and an Uruguayan envoy signed a treaty in Rio de Janeiro setting the international border between Brazil and Uruguay. The agreement required Uruguay to abandon some claims to disputed areas in exchange for Brazilian aid in the war against Argentina.|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Manuel {{had been}} {{determined}} to restore by force of arms the predominance of the Byzantine Empire in the Mediterranean countries. By the time he died in 1180, 37 years had <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo {{the damage done by}} the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was stronger and better organised than at any time for a century. While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, it is not so clear how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.|$|E
