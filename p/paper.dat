5|$|When Wilkes {{returned}} from California to New York City, {{he began to}} work for William T. Porter at Porter's newspaper The Spirit of the Times. Porter sold the <b>paper</b> in 1856 to Wilkes, who retained Porter on the newspaper's staff until Porter's death in 1858. Wilkes, however, renamed the <b>paper</b> to Porter's Spirit of the Times, a title it retained until 1859. In September 1859, Abraham C. Dayton, who had previously worked for the Spirit, left the <b>paper</b> and because he had purchased {{a share of the}} <b>paper</b> at one point from Porter, began publishing a <b>paper</b> he called Porter's Spirit of the Times. Dayton got a court order preventing Wilkes from using Porter's name, so Wilkes changed the name of his <b>paper</b> to Wilkes' Spirit of the Times, while Dayton continued to publish Porter's Spirit of the Times. Dayton was only able to publish until August 1861, however, as Wilkes drove the other <b>paper</b> out of business. Wilkes owned the surviving <b>paper</b> until his death in 1885.|$|E

5|$|A {{laboratory}} test showed how males of P. fimbriata from Queensland minimise {{the risk of}} meeting each other, by recognising fresh pieces of blotting <b>paper,</b> some containing their own silk draglines and some containing another male's draglines. Males also were attracted by fresh blotting <b>paper</b> containing females' draglines, while females {{do not respond to}} fresh blotting <b>paper</b> containing males' draglines. This suggested that the males usually search for females, rather than vice versa. Neither sex responded to one week-old blotting <b>paper,</b> irrespective of whether it contained males' or females' draglines. A similar series of tests showed that P. labiata showed the same patterns of responses between the sexes.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other {{techniques}} developed in parallel {{with the use of}} daguerreotypes. The ambrotype, using collodium to produce a positive image on glass, and the pannotype, also collodium-based, were both used in Denmark from around 1855. Negative-based <b>paper</b> prints, used {{from the beginning of the}} 1850s, were produced on salt <b>paper</b> until around 1857 when salt was replaced by albumen.

5|$|Although it is {{recorded}} that the Han Dynasty (202 BC– AD 220) court eunuch Cai Lun (50 AD– AD 121) invented the pulp papermaking process and established {{the use of}} new materials used in making <b>paper,</b> ancient padding and wrapping <b>paper</b> artifacts dating to the 2nd century BC {{have been found in}} China, the oldest example of pulp papermaking being a map from Fangmatan, Tianshui; by the 3rd century, <b>paper</b> as a writing medium was in widespread use, replacing traditional but more expensive writing mediums such as strips of bamboo rolled into threaded scrolls, strips of silk, wet clay tablets hardened later in a furnace, and wooden tablets. The earliest known piece of <b>paper</b> with writing on it was discovered in the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, where Han Dynasty troops had deserted their position in AD 110 following a Xiongnu attack. In the <b>paper</b> making process established by Cai in 105, a boiled mixture of mulberry tree bark, hemp, old linens and fish nets created a pulp that was pounded into paste and stirred with water; a wooden frame sieve with a mat of sewn reeds was then dunked into the mixture, which was then shaken and then dried into sheets of <b>paper</b> that were bleached under the exposure of sunlight; K.S. Tom says this process was gradually improved through leaching, polishing and glazing to produce a smooth, strong <b>paper.</b> <b>Paper</b> is used a lot.|$|E

5|$|Du Bois was {{the first}} African American invited by the American Historical Association (AHA) to present a <b>paper</b> at their annual conference. He read his <b>paper,</b> Reconstruction and Its Benefits, to an astounded {{audience}} at the AHA's December 1909 conference. The <b>paper</b> went against the mainstream historical view, promoted by the Dunning School of scholars at Columbia University, that Reconstruction was a disaster, caused by the ineptitude and sloth of blacks. To the contrary, Du Bois asserted that the brief period of African-American leadership in the South accomplished three important goals: democracy, free public schools, and new social welfare legislation. He asserted {{that it was the}} federal government's failure to manage the Freedmen's Bureau, to distribute land, and to establish an educational system, that doomed African-American prospects in the South. When Du Bois submitted the <b>paper</b> for publication a few months later in the American Historical Review, he asked that the word Negro be capitalized. The editor, J. Franklin Jameson, refused, and published the <b>paper</b> without the capitalization. The <b>paper</b> was mostly ignored by white historians. Du Bois later developed his <b>paper</b> as his ground-breaking 1935 book, Black Reconstruction, which marshaled extensive facts to support his assertions. The AHA did not invite another African-American speaker until 1940.|$|E
