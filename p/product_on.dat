5|$|Techniques such as {{artificial}} insemination and embryo transfer are frequently used today, {{not only as}} methods to guarantee that females breed regularly but also to help improve herd genetics. This may be done by transplanting embryos from high-quality females into lower-quality surrogate mothers – freeing up the higher-quality mother to be reimpregnated. This practice vastly increases the number of offspring which may be produced by a small selection of the best quality parent animals. On one hand, this improves {{the ability of the}} animals to convert feed to meat, milk, or fiber more efficiently, and improve the quality of the final <b>product.</b> <b>On</b> the other, it decreases genetic diversity, increasing the severity of certain disease outbreaks among other risks.|$|E

5|$|Following Chicken Fries' discontinuation, {{there was}} a call for the product's {{reinstatement}} from fans of the <b>product</b> <b>on</b> forums such as Reddit; Business Insider noted that {{they are one of}} the 17 most requested fast products that people would like to see returned to menus. Fans of the product also established several social media accounts dedicated to Chicken Fries' return on Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr. Additionally, a Change.org petition was created that called on Burger King to reinstate the product to its menu. Perez Hilton's web site declared that Chicken Fries are one product of many that will never come back, while comedian Daniel Tosh featured a skit during one of the segments of his show, Tosh.0, to the product's return. They were re-released in August 2014 as a limited time offering (LTO). The return of the product met with a favorable reaction from those who were advocating for Chicken Fries to return to the Burger King menu. There was disappointment from these groups as well because of the product's status as a limited time offering. In March 2015, Burger King permanently re-added Chicken Fries to the menu in a large, international menu expansion in thirty countries.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the structural interrelationships among consumer characteristics, shopping attitude, and shopping intention based on Fishbein and Azjen 2 ̆ 7 s (1975) Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). Study objectives were: (1) to identify characteristics of consumers who shop for cultural <b>products</b> <b>on</b> the Internet, (2) to propose theoretical models explaining consumers 2 ̆ 7 shopping for cultural <b>products</b> <b>on</b> the Internet, and (3) to empirically test the proposed models using {{a random sample of}} subjects who shop for cultural <b>products</b> <b>on</b> the Internet.;Findings from the present study indicated that consumer characteristics, the product, and the Website were all important factors to predict consumers 2 ̆ 7 intention to shop for cultural <b>products</b> <b>on</b> the Internet. Individuals with certain characteristics of Cultural Creatives (Ray 2 ̆ 6 Anderson, 2000) appear to be an important target market for selling cultural <b>products</b> <b>on</b> the Internet. While both product quality and Website attributes were important factors influencing a positive attitude toward shopping for cultural <b>products</b> <b>on</b> the Internet, only consumers 2 ̆ 7 positive beliefs about the Website significantly influenced their intention to shop on the Internet. Specifically, merchandising, such as keeping products in stock and offering competitive prices, appeared to be a critical factor in determining customers 2 ̆ 7 shopping intention. This study also revealed that consumers 2 ̆ 7 utilitarian shopping value appears to be more dominant than hedonic shopping value when they shop for cultural <b>products</b> <b>on</b> the Internet. For consumers with utilitarian shopping value, all aspects of the Website, information quality, merchandising, interface, and protection were important to make their shopping trip successful. Finally, proposed models with good fit and significant paths between belief structures and intention supported the effectiveness of the extended TRA in the context of cultural <b>product</b> shopping <b>on</b> the Internet.
