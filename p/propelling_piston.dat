50|$|The solenoid {{tends to}} attract the piston or {{projectile}} towards {{the middle of the}} solenoid. If a series of solenoids is used (which makes the nailgun into a type of coilgun), to get more power, each solenoid must be switched off when the piston has reached the middle of the solenoid. In multi-solenoid coilguns a short burst of power from a big capacitor (one attached to each solenoid) comes at the right time to <b>propel</b> the <b>piston</b> or projectile. For more information see Coilgun#Coilguns for ferromagnetic projectiles.|$|R

The operating characteristics of the GEN were found to differ significantly from those conventional engines, giving potential advantages in terms of fuel efficiency and emission. By removing complex fuel burning process to <b>propel</b> the <b>piston</b> completely, design of the GEN become very simple and leads to very cost effectiveness in both manufacturing and running of it.

50|$|The free-piston linear generator's great {{versatility}} {{comes from}} {{the absence of a}} crankshaft, removing a great pumping loss, giving the engine a further degree of freedom. The combustion can be two-stroke engine or four-stroke engine. However, a four-stroke requires a much higher intermediate storage of energy, the rotational inertia of the crankshaft, to <b>propel</b> the <b>piston</b> through the four strokes. With the absence of a crankshaft, a gas spring would need to power the piston through the intake, compression and exhaustion stokes. Hence the reason why most of the current research focuses on the two-strokes cycle.|$|R
25|$|The Nimrod was {{the first}} jet-powered {{maritime}} patrol aircraft (MPA) to enter service, being powered by the Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engine. Aircraft in this role had been commonly <b>propelled</b> by <b>piston</b> or turboprop powerplants instead to maximise fuel economy and enable maximum patrol time on station; advantages of the Nimrod's turbofan engines included greater speed and altitude capabilities, it was also more capable of evading detection methods by submarines, whereas propeller-driven aircraft are more detectable underwater to standard acoustic sensors. Inflight, the Nimrods had a flight endurance of ten hours without aerial refuelling; the MR2s were later fitted to receive mid-air refuelling in response to demands in the Falklands War.|$|R
5000|$|On June 9, 1893, {{the wheel}} was primed {{for a test}} run with great {{anticipation}} {{and a good deal}} of anxiety. The engine that would activate the wheel was fueled by steam boilers whose underground mains rushed steam to <b>propel</b> the <b>pistons</b> of its thousand-horsepower engines. Upon first seeing the wheel which towered over everything in its vicinity, Julian Hawthorne, son of the author Nathaniel, was amazed that anything of such a size [...] "continues to keep itself erect ... it has no visible means of support—none that appear adequate. The spokes look like cobwebs; they are after the fashion of those on the newest make of bicycles".|$|R
5000|$|An {{electropneumatic}} hammer {{is often}} called a [...] "rotary hammer," [...] because it has an electric motor, which rotates a crank. The hammer has two pistons—a drive piston and a free flight piston. The crank moves the drive piston {{back and forth in}} the same cylinder as the flight piston. The drive piston never touches the flight piston. Instead the drive piston compresses air in the cylinder, which then <b>propels</b> the flight <b>piston</b> against a striker, which contacts the drill bit.|$|R
40|$|Cytoskeletal {{remodeling}} {{is essential}} to eukaryotic cell division and morphogenesis. The mechanical forces driving the restructuring are attributed to the action of molecular motors and the dynamics of cytoskeletal filaments, which both consume chemical energy. By contrast, non-enzymatic filament crosslinkers are regarded as mere friction-generating entities. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that diffusible microtubule crosslinkers of the Ase 1 /PRC 1 /Map 65 family generate directed microtubule sliding when confined between partially overlapping microtubules. The Ase 1 -generated forces, directly measured by optical tweezers {{to be in the}} piconewton-range, were sufficient to antagonize motor-protein driven microtubule sliding. Force generation is quantitatively explained by the entropic expansion of confined Ase 1 molecules diffusing within the microtubule overlaps. The thermal motion of crosslinkers is thus harnessed to generate mechanical work analogous to compressed gas <b>propelling</b> a <b>piston</b> in a cylinder. As confinement of diffusible proteins is ubiquitous in cells, the associated entropic forces are likely of importance for cellular mechanics beyond cytoskeletal networks...|$|R
5000|$|George Chinn {{notes about}} the 1907 model that: [...] "While it was gas {{actuated}} {{by means of}} a piston, the French reversed the conventional principle. Instead of the piston thrust rearward furnishing the source of energy to operate the piece, the gas <b>propels</b> the <b>piston</b> forward to unlock the bolt. The piston is attached by a spring-loaded rod to a gear rack. This in turn engages a spur gear which is fastened to an actuating lever. When the lever is in the forward horizontal position and engages a cam slot in the bolt, the gun is locked. Upon firing, the gas drives the piston forward, compressing the spring and causing the spur gear to rotate clockwise. The actuating lever turns with the gear for a half revolution, retracting the bolt and stopping at the rear horizontal position. The driving spring then forces the piston rearward, which reverses the action and returns the bolt to battery." ...|$|R
50|$|Step {{and cruise}} climbs are not {{normally}} applicable to lower-flying aircraft <b>propelled</b> by conventional <b>piston</b> engines with propellers or turboprops, since their performance characteristics {{may be very}} different from those of turbofan or jet engined aircraft. In fact, the most efficient altitude for a small general aviation aircraft may be only a few thousand feet above the ground, and increasing altitude may diminish efficiency rather than improve it (propellers tend to lose efficiency in thinner air, and many small general aviation aircraft lack supercharging, effectively decreasing the engines compression ratio, and therefore efficiency, as the aircraft climbs into more rarified atmosphere).|$|R
50|$|Most guns use {{compressed}} gas confined by the barrel to propel the bullet up to high speed, though devices operating {{in other ways}} are sometimes called guns. In firearms the high-pressure gas is generated by combustion, usually of gunpowder. This principle {{is similar to that}} of internal combustion engines, except that the bullet leaves the barrel, while the piston transfers its motion to other parts and returns down the cylinder. As in an internal combustion engine, the combustion propagates by deflagration rather than by detonation, and the optimal gunpowder, like the optimal motor fuel, is resistant to detonation. This is because much of the energy generated in detonation is in the form of a shock wave, which can propagate from the gas to the solid structure and heat or damage the structure, rather than staying as heat to <b>propel</b> the <b>piston</b> or bullet. The shock wave at such high temperature and pressure is much faster than that of any bullet, and would leave the gun as sound either through the barrel or the bullet itself rather than contributing to the bullet's velocity.|$|R
50|$|The MAG uses ignited powder gases vented {{through a}} port in the barrel to <b>propel</b> a gas <b>piston</b> rod {{connected}} to the locking assembly (it uses a long-stroke piston system). The barrel breech is locked with a vertically tilting, downward locking lever mechanism that is {{connected to the}} bolt carrier through an articulated joint. The locking shoulder and camming surfaces that guide the locking lever are located {{at the base of the}} receiver. The MAG uses a series of proven design concepts from other successful firearms, for example the locking mechanism is modeled on that of the Browning M1918 (BAR) automatic rifle, and the feed and trigger mechanisms are from the WWII-era MG42 universal machine gun.|$|R
50|$|In {{the seventeenth}} and eighteenth centuries, Bristol harbour had been {{paramount}} as the focus of international trade with the New World. However the city centre location, and the difficult tidal negotiation of the Avon valley, was increasingly a constraint on development, particularly as larger vessels came into use. A number of schemes were put forward without success, but in 1846 the Portbury Pier and Railway Company obtained parliamentary authority to build a floating pier near Portbury, {{on the west side of}} the Avon near its mouth, and a railway to connect it to Bristol. Isambard Kingdom Brunel had proposed the development, and the railway was to be operated on the atmospheric principle, in which trains were <b>propelled</b> by a <b>piston</b> in a tube between the rails, from which the air ahead of the train had been exhausted by stationary steam engines.|$|R
5000|$|The {{practical}} {{effect of}} long barrels for modern guns {{is that the}} projectile spends {{more time in the}} barrel before it exits, and hence more time is available for expanding gas from the controlled burning of the propellant charge to smoothly accelerate the projectile, bringing about a higher velocity without placing undue strain on the gun. In internal ballistics terms, if the base of a projectile is thought of as a <b>piston</b> <b>propelled</b> by the expanding gas, then as barrel length increases the volume swept by the piston also increases, and hence the amount of energy that can be extracted from the gas's burning increases. A longer barrel allows more propellant to be used: the propellant is all burned fairly early in the projectile's journey along the barrel, except in the very common instance where combustion is still occurring as the projectile leaves the muzzle and a visible muzzle [...] "flash" [...] is produced.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Developments in {{the field}} of {{microturbine}} technology and gas turbine driven aircraft has been progressing without much progress in light aircraft predominantly <b>propelled</b> by <b>piston</b> engines. Because of inhibitive maintenance and overhaul costs of such however, propulsion via a gas turbine engine has been proposed with the potential of eventually replacing current engine configurations. Subsequently, the objective was to conceptually design a replacement gas turbine engine in the 150 kW range. A selection of case studies was used to illustrate the changing technologies to illustrate the technological viability of micro-gas turbines for light aircraft. Advantages and disadvantages of both engine types were discussed and a concise description of gas turbine operations and its components was given. A brief overview of fundamentals as well as the transmission layout was also supplied. Three configurations were isolated, namely the single spool design, a twin spool design featuring a free power turbine and the effect of a fuel conserving recuperator. Calculations were performed using Microsoft Excel, which proved sufficient in effectively calculating complex formulae - even under the necessary iterative feed-back conditions the design process demanded. Eventually, variable-specific design criteria were derived regarding the three engine types. Because fuel consumption still proved inhibitive, the effect of recuperation was investigated which yielded a very competitive engine - should the possibility of recuperator technology exist on time. As a result, one particular recuperated, single spool gas turbine engine was successfully identified. Having met all the design criteria sufficiently, this preliminary prototype design was numerically described and put within context of principal, peripheral working components such as a compatible gearbox layout...|$|R

The intravaginally located device is a low-invasive platform that can measure and react inside the cow vagina while providing external control and monitoring ability. The electronics manufactured from off the shelf components occupies 16 mL of a Theratron頳yringe. A microcontroller reads and logs sensor data and controls a gascell. The generated gas pressure <b>propels</b> the syringe <b>piston</b> and releases the formulation. A two way radio link allows communication between other devices or a base station.
