5|$|How the <b>Phylloxera</b> aphid was {{introduced}} to Europe remains debated: American vines had been taken to Europe many times before, for reasons including experimentation and trials in grafting, without consideration {{of the possibility of}} the introduction of pestilence. While the <b>Phylloxera</b> was thought to have arrived around 1858, it was first recorded in France in 1863, near the former province of Languedoc. It is argued by some that the introduction of such pests as <b>phylloxera</b> was only a problem after the invention of steamships, which allowed a faster journey across the ocean, and consequently allowed durable pests, such as the <b>Phylloxera,</b> to survive the trip.|$|E
5|$|For a few centuries, Europeans had {{experimented with}} American vines and plants in their soil, and many {{varieties}} were imported from America without regulation, disregarding {{the possibility of}} pest transfer, and related problems. Jules-Emile Planchon, a French biologist, who identified the <b>Phylloxera</b> in the 1860s, maintained that this transfer of American vines and plants into Europe greatly increased between roughly 1858 and 1862, {{and this is how}} the <b>Phylloxera</b> was accidentally introduced to Europe around 1860, although the aphid did not enter France until around 1863. It is believed that the advent of steamships was a factor as well, as the ships were faster, and the <b>Phylloxera</b> were able to survive the quicker ocean voyage.|$|E
5|$|The <b>phylloxera</b> {{epidemic}} in the 19th century severely affected the Languedoc wine industry, killing off {{many of the}} higher quality Vitis vinifera that were susceptible to the louse. American rootstock that was naturally resistant to <b>phylloxera</b> did not take well to the limestone soil on the hillside. In place of these vines, acres of the lower quality Aramon, Alicante Bouschet and Carignan were planted.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several {{theories}} proposed for why the <b>phylloxera</b> was ignored as the possible cause of the disease {{that resulted in the}} failure of so many vineyards, most of which involve the feeding behaviour of the insect, and the way it attacks the roots. The proboscis of the grape <b>phylloxera</b> has both a venom canal from which it injects its deadly venom and a feeding tube through which it takes in vine sap and nutrients. As the toxin from the venom corrodes the root structure of a vine, the sap pressure falls and, as a result, the <b>Phylloxera</b> quickly withdraws its feeding tube and searches for another source of food. Thus, anyone digging up a diseased and dying vine will not find <b>Phylloxera</b> clinging to the roots of the plant.|$|E
5|$|The aphid {{that was}} the central source of the damage in France was first noted {{following}} the growing of the European vine Vitis vinifera by French colonists in Florida, in the 16th century. These plantations were a failure, and later experiments with related species of vine also failed, although the reason for these failures {{appears to have been}} a mystery to the French colonists. It is known today that it was a species of North American grape <b>phylloxera</b> that caused these early vineyards to fail; the venom injected by the <b>Phylloxera</b> causes a disease that is quickly fatal to the European varieties of vine. The aphids initially went unnoticed by the colonists, despite their great numbers, and the pressure to successfully start a vineyard in America at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{variation}} of plant susceptibility to pests was probably known {{even in the}} early stages of agriculture in humans. In historic times, the observation of such variations in susceptibility have provided solutions for major socio-economic problems. The grape <b>phylloxera</b> was introduced from North America to France in 1860 and in 25 years it destroyed nearly a third (100,000km²) of the French grape yards. Charles Valentine Riley noted that the American species Vitis labrusca was resistant to <b>Phylloxera.</b> Riley, with J. E. Planchon, helped save the French wine industry by suggesting the grafting of the susceptible but high quality grapes onto Vitis labrusca root stocks.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, a bonus was introduced to reward farmers who retained their best bulls, even though they were not productive. The increase in weight of the animals began with improved grassland. The second half of the 19th century saw the arrival of fertilizers and improved pastures such as clover and ryegrass, which not only improved the productivity of existing fields but also transformed the moorland pasture. Vineyards affected by <b>phylloxera</b> were also being returned to pasture.|$|E
5|$|Biological control {{techniques}} {{as we know}} them today started to emerge in the 1870s. During this decade, in the USA, the Missouri State Entomologist C. V. Riley and the Illinois State Entomologist W. LeBaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests. The first international shipment of an insect as biological control agent was made by Charles V. Riley in 1873, shipping to France the predatory mites Tyroglyphus <b>phylloxera</b> to help fight the grapevine <b>phylloxera</b> (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) that was destroying grapevines in France. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the Division of Entomology in 1881, with C. V. Riley as Chief. The first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the United States was that of the braconid Cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884, imported from Europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae. In 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle, Rodolia cardinalis, a lady beetle, was introduced from Australia to California to control the cottony cushion scale, Icerya purchasi. This had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in California, {{but by the end of}} 1889 the cottony cushion scale population had already declined. This great success led to further introductions of beneficial insects into the USA.|$|E
5|$|During {{its history}} {{spanning}} seven centuries, the castle {{was owned by}} a succession of seven families. One of the owners, the count Lafaurie of Monbadon, peer of France, was a catalyst {{to the construction of}} the Eiffel bridge. In March 1891, the Quancard brothers Jean and Eugène bought the property for 110 000 francs, and the Quancard family remains the last owners. The purchase came after a severe <b>phylloxera</b> outbreak, causing the death of over half of French vineyards, devalued the property. The land area was covered mostly with rock until the Quancard brothers used explosives to remove it, and large amounts of clay-limestone soil, known to be beneficial for the wine produce, was brought to replace it.|$|E
5|$|The Sauvignon blanc grape traces {{its origins}} to western France in the Loire Valley and Bordeaux Regions. As noted above, {{it is not}} clear that the vine {{originated}} in western France. Ongoing research suggests it may have descended from Savagnin. It has also been associated with the Carmenere family. At some point in the 18th century, the vine paired with Cabernet Franc to parent the Cabernet Sauvignon vine in Bordeaux. In the 19th century, plantings in Bordeaux were often interspersed with Sauvignon vert (In Chile, known as Sauvignonasse) as well as the Sauvignon blanc pink mutation Sauvignon gris. Prior to the <b>phylloxera</b> epidemic, the insect plague which devastated French vineyards in the 19th century, these interspersed cuttings were transported to Chile where the field blends are still common today. Despite the similarity in names, Sauvignon blanc has no known relation to the Sauvignon rosé mutation found in the Loire Valley of France.|$|E
25|$|Like aphids, <b>phylloxera</b> {{feed on the}} roots, leaves, {{and shoots}} of grape plants, but unlike aphids, do not produce {{honeydew}} or cornicle secretions. <b>Phylloxera</b> (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) are insects which caused the great French wine blight that devastated European viticulture in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Argentina, like Chile, {{is unique}} in the wine world {{for the absence of}} the <b>phylloxera</b> threat that has devastated {{vineyards}} across the globe. Unlike Chile, the <b>phylloxera</b> louse is present in Argentina but is a particular weak biotype that does not survive long in the soil. When it does attack vines, the damage is not significant enough to kill the vine and the roots eventually grow back.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{this most}} of the {{vineyards}} in Argentina are planted on ungrafted rootstock. There are many theories about why <b>phylloxera</b> has not yet reach {{this part of the}} world. The centuries-old tradition of flood irrigation where water is allowed to deeply saturate the soil may be one reason, as is the high proportion of sand present in the soil. The relative isolation of Argentina is also cited as a potential benefit against <b>phylloxera</b> with the country's wine regions being bordered by mountains, deserts and oceans that create natural barriers against the spread of the louse. Despite the minimal risk of <b>phylloxera,</b> some producers are switching to grafted rootstock that provide better yield control.|$|E
25|$|He {{also made}} {{significant}} contribution {{to the study of the}} <b>phylloxera</b> of grapes, which he pursued for several years. The notes of his observations La questione fillosserica in Italia (1904) influenced the Italian Ministry of Agriculture, which eventually requested him to do an exhaustive study of this subject. In 1912 he produced a monumental investigation of the morphology and biology of the Italian and other European genera of <b>phylloxera.</b> It was a foundation for systematic control of agricultural pests.|$|E
25|$|A modern {{outbreak}} of <b>phylloxera</b> {{was discovered in}} the valley in 1983 in a vineyard planted with AxR1 rootstock. Many growers seized upon this outbreak {{as an opportunity to}} switch to varieties that were better suited to the climate and soil. By the late 1990s nearly 75% of the affected vineyards had been replanted with <b>phylloxera</b> resistant rootstock. The growers in the region are currently channeling their energy to battle the Glassy-winged sharpshooter, a non-native pest that carries Pierce's disease.|$|E
25|$|Mourvèdre had a {{well-established}} presence in Roussillon region of France {{by at least}} the 16th century where it spread eastwards towards Provence and the Rhone. There it had a well established foothold until the <b>phylloxera</b> epidemic of {{the mid to late}} 19th century decimated plantings. As the French and other European wine regions recovered from the <b>phylloxera</b> scourge by grafting Vitis vinifera varieties to American rootstock, it was discovered that Mourvèdre vines did not take well to the grafting and many vineyards were replanted with other varieties.|$|E
25|$|By the 1880s, the French brandy {{industry}} was {{devastated by the}} <b>phylloxera</b> pest that ruined much of the grape crop; as a result, whisky became the primary liquor in many markets.|$|E
25|$|But just as French vignerons were {{recovering}} from oidium came a new mysterious ailment that caused decay or {{death in the}} grapevines. The cause was a tiny louse, known as <b>phylloxera,</b> imported from North America. This louse targets the rootstock of the vine. The solution to this epidemic also came from North America in the grafting of naturally resistant American rootstocks to the European vines. However, while the importing of this new North American plant material helped {{to stave off the}} <b>phylloxera</b> epidemic, it brought with it yet more problems-the fungal disease of downy mildew that first surfaced in 1878 and black rot that followed in the 1880s.|$|E
25|$|In 1855, the châteaux of Bordeaux were classified; this {{classification}} remains {{widely used}} today. From 1875–1892 almost all Bordeaux vineyards were ruined by <b>Phylloxera</b> infestations. The region's wine industry was rescued by grafting native vines on to pest-resistant American rootstock.|$|E
25|$|Hickory is one {{of several}} host species of the twig girdler (Oncideres cingulata). Infested trees and {{seedlings}} are not only damaged severely but become ragged and unattractive. A few of the more common species of gall-producing insects attacking hickory are <b>Phylloxera</b> caryaecaulis, Caryomyia holotricha, C. sanguinolenta, and C. tubicola.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1980s, dessert wines {{made from}} the Malvasia delle Lipari variety has seen a {{resurgence}} in interest on the volcanic Aeolian Islands off the north east coast of Sicily. With distinctive orange notes, this Sicilian wine saw its peak of popularity just before the <b>phylloxera</b> epidemic when more than 2.6 million gallons (100,000 hectoliters) was produced annually.|$|E
25|$|Despite being {{politically}} {{linked to}} Spain, Chile's wine {{history has been}} most profoundly influenced by French, particularly Bordeaux, winemaking. Prior to the <b>phylloxera</b> epidemic, wealthy Chilean landowners were influenced by their visits to France and began importing French vines to plant. Don Silvestre Errázuriz was the first, importing Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet franc, Malbec, Sauvignon blanc and Sémillon. He hired a French oenologist to oversee his vineyard planting and to produce wine in the Bordeaux style. Errázuriz saw potential in Chile and even experimented with the German wine grape Riesling. In events that parallel those of the Rioja wine region, the entrance of <b>phylloxera</b> into the French wine world turned into a positive event for the Chilean wine industry. With vineyards in ruin, many French winemakers traveled to South America, bringing their experience and techniques with them. At the time, Don Silvestre Ochagavía Echazarreta founded Ochagavia Wines in 1851 and Don Maximiano Errázuriz founded Viña Errázuriz in 1870, bringing and using grapes from France.|$|E
25|$|The wind {{alone was}} not enough to prevent the {{outbreak}} of the <b>phylloxera</b> epidemic in the mid 19th century, which nearly destroyed the entire Empordà wine industry despite many individuals watching and analyzing the progress of the disease as it made its way south from France. Many vineyards were only replanted as recently as {{the latter half of the}} 20th century and even early 21st.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the pests noted above, vineyards in the Hunter Valley are usually grafted on <b>phylloxera</b> resistant rootstock {{to help keep the}} louse at bay. During the growing season kangaroos are frequent threats to the young buds and shoots of grapevines, requiring tall barb wire fences to keep the hopping creature out. Ever present nuisances near harvest time are the frequent birds that descend upon the area.|$|E
25|$|In 1872, the {{sparkling}} wine Cava {{was invented in}} the Penedès region and eventually became an internationally recognized wine style. When <b>phylloxera</b> hit the region {{towards the end of}} the 19th century, Catalonia's vineyards comprised over 80% red wine grapes. The growing Cava industry encouraged planting of more white wine grapes, in place of the diseased red rootstock, where they now make up nearly 70% of the region's vineyards.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century {{wine-growing}} became one of the mainstays of the local economy. For this reason the devastation caused by the dual scourge of mildew and <b>phylloxera</b> that hit the region in 1882 came as a particularly heavy blow. The extent of the damage was even greater because the wine-growers initially refused to pull up their vines, trying instead to treat them with carbon disulfide, though without success.|$|E
25|$|Pinot noir {{is almost}} {{certainly}} a very ancient variety that may be {{only one or two}} generations removed from wild, Vitis sylvestris, vines. Its origins are nevertheless unclear: In De re rustica, Columella describes a grape variety similar to pinot noir in Burgundy during the 1st century CE, however, vines have grown wild as far north as Belgium in the days before <b>phylloxera,</b> and it is possible that Pinot represents a direct domestication of (hermaphrodite-flowered) Vitis sylvestris.|$|E
25|$|Viticulture in Napa {{suffered}} several setbacks in {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries. The <b>Phylloxera</b> louse killed many of the vines throughout the valley. Prohibition, enacted in 1920, caused many wineries to shut down. A few remained open with agreements to produce sacramental wine. Growers who elected to keep their vines planted sold their crops to home winemakers. The Great Depression slowed the wine business further. These events stalled {{the growth of the}} wine industry in Napa County, California for years.|$|E
25|$|In the 14th century, the Franciscan writer Francesc Eiximenis {{described}} Catalan wines as strong, dense, highly alcoholic wines which, although high quality, sometimes {{needed to}} be diluted with water. A turning point for the Catalan wine industry occurred in the 19th century with {{the outbreak of the}} <b>phylloxera</b> epidemic that ravaged the French vineyards to the north. Along with wines from the Rioja region, Catalan wines became a welcome import for French consumers suffering a severe shortage of domestic produce.|$|E
25|$|The mid 19th century {{brought a}} {{succession}} of calamities that crippled the South African wine industry. In 1859 oidium first appeared and quickly spread through the Cape. This {{was followed by a}} series of agreements made in 1860s (most notably the Cobden-Chevalier Treaty) between the Gladstone government and France that reduced the preferential tariffs which had benefited South African wine in favor of French wine exports. In 1866, the <b>phylloxera</b> epidemic reached the Cape, causing widespread devastation that would take more than 20 years to recover from.|$|E
25|$|The late 19th century {{also saw}} {{the advent of the}} <b>phylloxera</b> epidemic, a type of {{parasite}} similar to aphids, which had already ravaged France and other European vineyards. Vineyards were destroyed and many smaller operations went out of business. Fortunately, the remedy of grafting resistant American rootstock was well known, and the Californian wine industry was able to quickly rebound, and utilizing the opportunity to expand the plantings of new grape varieties. By the turn of the 20th century nearly 300 grape varieties were being grown in the state, supplying its nearly 800 wineries.|$|E
25|$|A new {{decline of}} the city began in 1880. The {{economic}} crisis of 1893 forced {{the closing of the}} La Constancia iron foundry and was accompanied by the collapse of the sugar industry and the spread of the <b>phylloxera</b> blight, which devastated the vineyards surrounding Málaga. The early 20th century was a period of economic readjustment that produced a progressive industrial dismantling and fluctuating development of commerce. Economic depression, social unrest and political repression made it possible for petite bourgeois republicanism and the labour movement to consolidate their positions.|$|E
25|$|The {{region was}} under the {{influence}} of the Duchy of Burgundy for most of its history which partly the reason why plantings were once heavily dominated by the Pinot noir grape. The <b>Phylloxera</b> epidemic of the 19th century altered that dynamic when many of the Pinot noir vineyards were wiped out by the louse. In their place, plantings of the easier to cultivate Sauvignon blanc vine began to increase. While there are still isolated batches of Pinot noir in the region, Sauvignon blanc is now the most heavily planted.|$|E
25|$|The 19th {{century was}} a {{turbulent}} time of political, {{economic and social}} crisis in Málaga. The War of the Third Coalition (1803–1806) fought against Great Britain decimated Spain's maritime commerce while the deadly 1803–1804 epidemic of Yellow Fever killed more than 26,000 people in Málaga alone. The city suffered the further ravages of the Peninsular War, conflicts between royal absolutists and liberals, {{the end of the}} transatlantic trade with the Americas, the collapse of its industry, and finally the <b>phylloxera</b> epidemic that destroyed the vineyards of the region.|$|E
25|$|Grassi was {{the first}} to {{demonstrate}} the life cycle of human dwarf tapeworm Taenia nana, and that this tapeworm does not require an intermediate host, contrary to popular belief. He {{was the first}} to demonstrate the direct life cycle of the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides by self-experimentation. He described canine filarial worm Dipetalonema reconditum, and demonstrated the parasite life cycle in fleas, Pulex irritans. He invented the genus of threadworms Strongyloides. He named the spider Koenenia mirabilis in 1885 after his wife, Maria Koenen. He pioneered the foundation of pest control for <b>phylloxera</b> of grapes.|$|E
25|$|Following the <b>phylloxera</b> epidemic, {{winemaking}} in the Friuli {{region was}} very muted {{and did not}} begin to garner much attention till the 1970s. The international popularity of Pinot grigio in the 1980s and 1990s help to change the dynamic of Friuli-Venezia Giulia winemaking. Prior to this time vineyard owners sold their grapes in bulk to co-ops and négociant-like wineries that would blend the grapes together. With the success of Mario Schiopetto in bottling and marketing the product of his own vineyard, other vineyard owners followed suit and began opening up small wineries of their own.|$|E
