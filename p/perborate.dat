5|$|Boron is {{primarily}} used in chemical compounds. About {{half of all}} boron consumed globally is an additive in fiberglass for insulation and structural materials. The next leading use is in polymers and ceramics in high-strength, lightweight structural and refractory materials. Borosilicate glass is desired for its greater strength and thermal shock resistance than ordinary soda lime glass. Boron compounds are used as fertilizers in agriculture and in sodium <b>perborate</b> bleaches. A small amount of boron {{is used as a}} dopant in semiconductors, and reagent intermediates in the synthesis of organic fine chemicals. A few boron-containing organic pharmaceuticals are used or are in study. Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which (boron-10) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent.|$|E

500|$|Sodium <b>perborate</b> {{serves as}} a source of active oxygen in many detergents, laundry detergents, {{cleaning}} products, and laundry bleaches. However, despite its name, [...] "Borateem" [...] laundry bleach no longer contains any boron compounds, using sodium percarbonate instead as a bleaching agent.|$|E
50|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} {{is produced}} in very large amounts by several different processes. Its action as an oxidizer {{is why it is}} made and used in such large quantities. It is used by itself as a bleaching agent, for example to bleach wood pulp, hair and so on, or to prepare other bleaching agents like the <b>perborates,</b> percarbonates, peracids, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{inorganic}} peroxides {{are used}} for bleaching textiles and paper and as a bleaching additive to detergents and cleaning products. The increasing environmental concerns resulted in the preference of peroxides over chlorine-based compounds and {{a sharp increase in}} the peroxide production. The past use of <b>perborates</b> as additives to detergents and cleaning products has been largely replaced by percarbonates in order to decrease the emission of boron to the environment. Sodium percarbonate is used in such products as OxiClean and Tide laundry detergent. When dissolved in water, it releases hydrogen peroxide and soda ash (sodium carbonate): ...|$|R
40|$|Bleaching {{detergent}} formulations contain environmentally unfriendly {{bleaching agents}} (<b>perborates</b> and percarbonates), which cause aquatic eutrophication, although without these compounds detergents {{are much less}} efficient for the washing processes. In an effort to replace these compounds, in this study, hydrogen peroxide was generated as a bleaching compound by means of enzymatic reactions. Three different pathways were investigated. The first one was the H 2 O 2 production from glucose by glucose oxidase. The second one was the production of H 2 O 2 from carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) {{by the action of}} both cellulase, which promotes the hydrolysis of the polymeric chain, and glucose oxidase, which oxidizes the smaller fractions to produce H 2 O 2. Finally, H 2 O 2 was also obtained from ethanol, which is present in liquid detergents, by the action of the enzyme alcohol oxidase. In the search for maximal peroxide production, substrate concentration and enzymatic activities were optimized. The effect of H 2 O 2 produced in the washing process was simulated by means of a process of cotton bleaching. Although enzymatic-reaction oxidations produced higher levels of hydroge...|$|R

5000|$|Unlike sodium {{percarbonate}} and perphosphate, the sodium <b>perborate</b> {{is not simply}} an adduct with hydrogen peroxide. Rather, it adopts a cyclic structure with a B2O4 core and four hydroxide groups attached to the two boron atoms. The ring has a chair-shaped 6-membered ring.|$|E
50|$|The {{compound}} {{is suitable}} as a complexing agent for heavy metal ions or alkaline earth metal ions, as a stabilizer for bleaching agents (e.g. for sodium <b>perborate,</b> in solid detergent preparations) {{and as a}} builder in detergents for inhibiting the formation of incrustations in textiles during laundering.|$|E
50|$|Sodium <b>perborate</b> (PBS) is a white, odorless, {{water-soluble}} {{chemical compound}} with the chemical formula Na2B2O4(OH)4. It is usually encountered as the tetrahydrate, but monohydrate, NaBO3·H2O and trihydrates {{are well known}} NaBO3·3H2O and The monohydrate and tetrahydrate are the commercially important forms.

50|$|The {{peroxide}} anion is {{a stronger}} nucleophile than hydroxide and displaces hydroxyl from oxyanions e.g. forming perborates and percarbonates. Sodium <b>perborate</b> and sodium percarbonate are important consumer and industrial bleaching agents; they stabilize hydrogen peroxide and limit side reactions (e.g. reduction and decomposition note below). The peroxide anion forms an adduct with urea, hydrogen peroxide-urea.|$|E
50|$|Bocasan was {{packaged}} in a 1.7 gram envelope, and contained 69.72% sodium <b>perborate</b> monohydrate and 29.68% sodium hydrogen tartrate anhydous. To use, the contents were dissolved in 30 cubic centimetres of warm water. Half the amount was swilled around the mouth {{for two minutes}} and discarded, and the procedure repeated with the remainder. Treatment was recommended {{three times a day}} after meals.|$|E
50|$|Louis Jacques Thénard first {{produced}} {{hydrogen peroxide}} in 1818 by reacting barium peroxide with nitric acid. Hydrogen peroxide {{was first used}} for bleaching in 1882, but did not become commercially important until after 1930. Sodium <b>perborate</b> as a laundry bleach {{had been used in}} Europe since the early twentieth century, but did not become popular in North America until the 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|Bleach {{activation}} is {{also known}} as perhydrolysis. Persalts are inorganic salts that are used as hydrogen peroxide carriers (examples include sodium percarbonate and sodium <b>perborate).</b> Persalts and bleach activators are included together in powder laundry detergents that contain bleach.

50|$|Several common {{detergent}} {{ingredients are}} surfactants, builders, bleach-active compounds and auxiliary agents. The surfactants {{can be classified}} into anionic, cationic and nonionic surfactants. The most widely used surfactant linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) is an anionic surfactant. In builders, sodium triphosphate, zeolite A, sodium nitrilotriacetate (NTA) {{are the most important}} substances. Bleach-active compounds are usually sodium <b>perborate</b> and sodium percarbonate. Enzymes and fluorescent whitening agents are added into detergents as auxiliary agents.|$|E
50|$|Cystamine (2,2--Dithiobisethanamine) is {{an organic}} {{disulfide}} which is formed when Cystine is heated {{as a result}} of decarboxylation. It is often used as sulfhydryl reagent, enzyme inhibitor and radiation-protective agent. Thiols can be synthesized to disulfides like cystamine through chemical oxidation with various oxidizing agents (molecular oxygen, metal ion, metal oxide, DMSO, nitric oxide, halogen and sodium <b>perborate),</b> through electrochemical oxidation and through borohydride exchange resin (BER)-transition metal salts systems (like BER-CuSo4).|$|E
5000|$|Invented in 1907, Persil {{is notable}} {{because it was}} the first commercially {{available}} [...] "self-activated" [...] laundry detergent. (A self activated detergent is one which contains bleach combined with the soap components.) The creation of Persil was a significant chemical breakthrough. The name, [...] "Persil", is derived from two of its original ingredients, sodium <b>perborate</b> and silicate. However, the original name was deemed unsuitable as an international brand, as it is hard to pronounce in some languages; coincidentally, it is the French word for the herb, parsley.|$|E
50|$|Bleaching is {{a process}} for {{whitening}} fabrics which has been practiced for thousands of years. Sometimes {{it was simply a}} matter of leaving the fabric in the sun, to be faded by the bright light. In the 18th century several scientists developed varieties of chlorine bleach, including sodium hypochlorite and calcium hypochlorite (bleaching powder). Bleaching agents that do not contain chlorine most often are based on peroxides, such as hydrogen peroxide, sodium percarbonate and sodium <b>perborate.</b> While most bleaches are oxidizing agents, a fewer number are reducing agents such as sodium dithionite.|$|E
5000|$|Persil is a {{brand of}} laundry {{detergent}} made by Henkel; but which is now also licensed for manufacture, distribution, and marketing in several countries by Unilever. Henkel and Unilever both manufacture their own formulations. Introduced in 1907, Persil is notable {{because it was the}} first commercially available [...] "self-activated" [...] laundry detergent. The name, Persil, is derived from two of its original ingredients, sodium <b>perborate</b> and sodium silicate. It is Unilever's premium brand in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Persil is sold in many forms, with several [...] "environment friendly" [...] products.|$|E
50|$|After chlorine-based bleaches, the {{peroxide}} bleaches {{are most}} commonly encountered. Peroxides are compounds that contain an oxygen-oxygen single bond, O-O. This {{is a fairly}} weak bond so reactions of peroxides often involve breaking this bond, giving very reactive oxygen species. Most peroxide bleaches are adducts of hydrogen peroxide. They contain hydrogen peroxide, HOOH in combination with another material like sodium carbonate or urea. An exception is sodium <b>perborate,</b> which has a cyclic structure containing two O-O single bonds. All peroxide-based bleaches release hydrogen peroxide when dissolved in water. Peroxide bleaches are often used with catalysts and activators, e.g., tetraacetylethylenediamine or sodium nonanoyloxybenzenesulfonate.|$|E
