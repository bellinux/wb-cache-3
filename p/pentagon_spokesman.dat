500|$|According to U.S. defense officials, {{upon his}} return to the base Bales said three words: [...] "I did it" [...] and then told {{individuals}} what happened. Later he retained a lawyer and refused to speak further with investigators. The U.S. flew Bales out of Afghanistan to Kuwait on 14 March 2012, then to the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas on 16 March. [...] A <b>Pentagon</b> <b>spokesman</b> said the move was done because of a [...] "legal recommendation".|$|E
500|$|It is {{customary}} for the Air Force {{to impound}} radar trackings involving possible litigation {{in cases of}} aviation accidents. In the civil litigation for damages, the United States Department of Justice explained that the tapes from the Air Force radar installation at King Salmon, Alaska pertinent to KAL007's flight in the Bethel area had been destroyed and could therefore not be supplied to the plaintiffs. At first Justice Department lawyer Jan Van Flatern stated that they were destroyed 15 days after the shootdown. Later, {{he said he had}} [...] "misspoken" [...] and changed the time of destruction to 30 hours after the event. A <b>Pentagon</b> <b>spokesman</b> concurred, saying that the tapes are re-cycled for reuse from 24–30 hours afterwards; the fate of KAL007 was known inside this timeframe.|$|E
50|$|In March 1998, at the {{recommendation}} of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and with the concurrence of the Secretary of Defense, RADM Wilson was assigned as the Joint Staff Director of Intelligence, J-2, a Defense Intelligence Agency billet operationally allocated to the Joint Staff. The J2 concurrently serves as the Defense Intelligence Agency’s Director of Current Intelligence Operations and is responsible for the operation of the National Military Joint Intelligence Center (NMJIC) which is collocated with the National Military Command Center. The Joint Staff J2 is charged with leading and directing current and crisis intelligence support for the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and managing intelligence support for contingency operations, including targeting and battle damage assessment responsibilities, with the combatant commands. The Joint Staff was almost continually engaged in high paced contingency operations during RADM Wilson’s time as J2 in 1998-99: Daily No Fly Zone enforcement over Iraq, the conduct of a four-day strike campaign (Operation Desert Fox) against Iraq in December 1998, and the escalating crisis in Kosovo culminating in a 78-day NATO bombing campaign (Operation Allied Force) led by the U.S. against the former Yugoslavia from 24 March - 11 June 1999. Terrorism against the United States also escalated significantly during this period of time when Al Qaida operatives in Kenya and Tanzania conducted suicide bombing attacks against United States embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam on 7 August 1998. This resulted in strike operations conducted less than two weeks later by U.S. forces against Al Qaida targets in Afghanistan and Sudan. In addition to coordinating intelligence support both up and down the chain of command, the Joint Staff intelligence team was intricately engaged in the analysis, selection, targeting, and battle damage assessments (BDA) associated with the respective strike campaigns. RADM Wilson frequently provided targeting and BDA briefings to the President, his national security team, and relevant congressional committees. He also was one of the primary <b>Pentagon</b> <b>spokesmen</b> who regularly briefed the national press corps on ongoing strike operations and BDA.|$|R
5000|$|The FBI {{declared}} {{that it could}} not investigate the matter, as it was up to the Defense Department to do so. For its part, the <b>Pentagon,</b> through its <b>spokesman</b> Lawrence Di Rita, appeared to have transitioned from flat denials to vagueness and unsettled syntax: [...] "There have been instances, and we'll have more to say about it as we learn more, but where a Quran may have fallen to the floor in the course of searching a cell." [...] Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, told reporters that [...] "past accusations have had credibility issues." ...|$|R
500|$|In May 2000, {{challenged}} by a skeptical U.S. News & World Report magazine article, the AP team did additional archival research, {{and reported that}} one of nine ex-soldiers quoted in the original No Gun Ri article, Edward L. Daily, had incorrectly identified himself as an eyewitness, and instead had been passing on second-hand information. A <b>Pentagon</b> <b>spokesman</b> said that this would not affect the Army's No Gun Ri investigation, noting Daily was [...] "just one guy of many we've been talking to". Army officer Robert Bateman, a 7th Cavalry veteran, who collaborated on the U.S. News & World Report article with a fellow 7th Cavalry association member, also published a book, , repeating his contentions that the AP reporting was flawed. The AP's methods and conclusions were defended by the AP in a lengthy, detailed refutation and by others. The Pulitzer committee reaffirmed its award and {{the credibility of the}} AP reporting.|$|E
500|$|Outgoing Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta {{defended the}} award's precedence, saying [...] "Our {{military}} reserves its highest decorations obviously {{for those who}} display gallantry and valor in actions when their lives {{are on the line}} {{and we will continue to}} do so. But we should also have the ability to honor the extraordinary actions that make a true difference in combat operations. The contribution they make does contribute to the success of combat operations, particularly when they remove the enemy from the field of battle, even if those actions are physically removed from the fight." [...] <b>Pentagon</b> <b>spokesman,</b> Lieutenant Commander Nate Christensen, added, [...] "Extraordinary achievement directly impacting combat operations at this level deserves to be recognized with a distinctive medal, not a device on an existing medal. The DWM is visionary in that it fills a need for a non-valorous combat impact medal." ...|$|E
500|$|American {{officials}} said {{according to the}} New York Times that Hillary Clinton's increasingly cordial relationship with the young Pakistani foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar paid dividends in resolving the dispute between both countries over the Salala incident. A final agreement on the wording of Clinton's statement of her conversation with Khar came {{after a week of}} marathon talks that included two trips to Islamabad by General John R. Allen, the US commander in Afghanistan, and a quickly arranged weekend trip by Thomas R. Nides, the deputy secretary of state for management and resources. In recent weeks Nides and Pakistani Finance Minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh had spearheaded the negotiations to reopen the supply lines. After weeks of behind-the-scenes phone calls, e-mails and meetings between Nides and Abdul Hafeez Shaikh reached an agreement on the terms for the reopening of the NATO supply lines. Besides the US apology both sides agreed to the following: After initially demanding as much as $5,000 for each truck Pakistan dropped its insistence on a higher transit fee for each truck carrying NATO’s nonlethal supplies from Pakistan into Afghanistan and agreed to keep the fee at the current rate of $250. The Obama Administration will ask Congress to reimburse Pakistan about $1.2 billion for costs incurred by 150,000 Pakistani troops carrying out counterinsurgency operations along the border with Afghanistan. [...] "With the GLOCs open, we will look to pay past coalition support fund claims," [...] <b>Pentagon</b> <b>spokesman</b> Captain John Kirby said, using a Pentagon acronym for the supply routes. The United States military reimburses by [...] "coalition support funds" [...] Pakistan for logistical, military and other support provided to American military operations against militants, but these payments have been suspended since Pakistan shut off the routes. More precisely the US halted paying the bills from Pakistan as tension rose between the two countries.|$|E

Moreover, in reference to the plane's proximity to China, the Pentagon said that, “Military activities may be conducted within the Exclusive Economic Zone of another nation as an exercise of the freedoms of navigation and overflight.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 7, 2008, Hamdan {{was sentenced}} by the {{military}} jury to {{five and a half}} years (66 months) imprisonment. Prosecutors had urged a sentence of 30 years-to-life, while Hamdan's defense had recommended less than 45 months. At the time he was already credited for having served 61 months, so the sentence imposed five months additional imprisonment. A <b>Pentagon</b> <b>spokesman</b> noted that Hamdan's status could revert to [...] "enemy combatant" [...] after his sentence was served, and as such he could be indefinitely detained.|$|E
2500|$|Captain John Kirby, a <b>Pentagon</b> <b>spokesman,</b> {{was quoted}} in a December 2011 Reuters article: [...] "Efforts to {{increase}} tension {{in that part of}} the world are unhelpful and counter-productive.

2500|$|After {{passage of}} the Military Commissions Act of 2006, Hamdan was tried on revised charges {{beginning}} July 21, 2008, {{the first of the}} detainees to be tried under the new system. He was found guilty of [...] "providing material support" [...] to al Qaeda, but was acquitted by the jury of terrorism conspiracy charges. He was sentenced to five-and-a-half years of imprisonment by the military jury, which credited him for his detention as having already served five years of the sentence. A <b>Pentagon</b> <b>spokesman</b> noted then that DOD might still classify Hamdan as an [...] "enemy combatant" [...] after he completed his sentence, and detain him indefinitely.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 September 2013, the U.S. Department of Defense {{announced}} that the remaining four Burke-class destroyers {{will remain in the}} eastern Mediterranean as Russian and American diplomats negotiate the turn-over of Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons to the United Nations, with <b>Pentagon</b> <b>spokesman</b> George E.

The United States has not [...] "begun considering any specific recommendations for troop numbers in 2013 and 2014," [...] said George Little, the <b>Pentagon</b> <b>spokesman.</b> [...] "What is true is that in June 2011 the president made clear that our forces would continue to come home at a steady pace as we transition to an Afghan lead for security.

2500|$|Begg {{notes that}} he visited a second Afghan {{training}} camp, near Jalalabad, {{for two or three}} days during that time. He says it was run by Iraqi Kurds, not by al-Qaeda. They were training to use improvised incendiary grenades to fight Saddam Hussein. He donated a few hundred British pounds to that camp and a third training camp. [...] A <b>Pentagon</b> <b>spokesman</b> said Begg spent five days in early 1998 at Derunta, an al-Qaeda-affiliated Afghan training camp. Defense Department officials said that Begg's sworn statements state he trained at Derunta and two other Afghan camps. He denied saying that, but acknowledged signing some documents while in custody because he feared for his life.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 March 2016, U.S. airstrikes {{carried out}} by {{aircraft}} and unmanned drones killed more than 150 Al-Shabaab terrorists at a terrorist training camp called [...] "Camp Raso", located about 120 miles north of Mogadishu as they were completing [...] "training for a large-scale attack" [...] according to a <b>Pentagon</b> <b>spokesman.</b> The camp had been under surveillance for some time before the strike.

The Military Times also reported that on September 26 a bomb-manufacturing network linked al-Shabaab attacked a small team of U.S. and Somali troops, who were conducting an operation near Kismayo, with small-arms fire. A <b>Pentagon</b> <b>spokesman</b> said the U.S. military “conducted a self-defense strike to neutralize the threat {{and in doing so}} killed nine enemy fighters.” Also on September 28, near the town of Galkayo, a Somali army unit conducting counterterrorism operations nearby, when the Somali soldiers came under fire from al-Shabab militants.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Anderson Cooper on November 3, 2010, when discussing cuts in government spending for Medicare and Social Security suggested by Congressman Paul Ryan, Bachmann was asked what cuts in government spending she would make to reduce the deficit. She cited President Obama's then-upcoming visit to Asia as an example, saying it [...] "is expected to cost the taxpayers $200million a day. He's taking two thousand people with him. He'll be renting out over 870 rooms in India. And these are 5-star hotel rooms at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel. This {{is the kind of}} over-the-top spending, it's a very small example, Anderson." [...] Bachmann was apparently referring to information in a story from the Press Trust of India, attributed to [...] "a top official of the Maharashtra Government privy to the arrangements for the high-profile visit", information that was also published in U.S.-based media such as The Drudge Report. In response to the news report's claim that 34 warships were accompanying the President, a <b>Pentagon</b> <b>spokesman,</b> Geoff Morrell, dismissed the account as [...] "comical". The White House said that the press report figures were [...] "wildly inflated" [...] and had [...] "no basis in reality". While stating that they could not give the actual projected figures for security reasons, staffers maintained costs were in line with the official travel costs of previous presidents Bush and Clinton.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 March 2017, CNN {{reported}} that US President Donald Trump signed off {{a decision by}} the White House which approved a new strategy granting AFRICOM the authority to step up counterterrorism strikes in Somalia; under the new strategy, the US military will now be able to conduct precision airstrikes in support of the Somalia National Army and AMISOM forces. The new authorization designates some regions of Somalia an [...] "area of active hostilities," [...] freeing counterterrorism strikes there from restrictions governing other strikes outside the areas; an official said that the designated areas will not include Mogadishu and Puntland. Captain Jeff Davis, a <b>Pentagon</b> <b>Spokesman</b> said that [...] "The additional support provided by this authority will help deny al-Shabaab safe havens from which it could attack US citizens or US interests in the region." [...] Another official said that the legal basis for the new authority is the 2001 AUMF. In mid-April 2017, it was {{reported that}} 40 soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division were deployed to Somalia on 2 April 2017 to improve the capabilities of the Somalia Army in combating Islamist militants. AFRICOM stated that the troops will focus on bolstering the Somali army's logistics capabilities; an AFRICOM spokesman said that [...] "This mission is not associated with teaching counterextremism tactics” and that the Somali government requested the training.|$|E

Petrelis held an impromptu press conference. He carried with him a box of copies of an article by Michelangelo Signorile from the most recent issue of the Advocate, outing Williams. Petrelis scolded the reporters for ignoring the story and urged them to ask Williams directly about his homosexuality. A half hour into Williams' briefing that day, Rolf Paasch, a foreign correspondent with Berlin's Die Tageszeitung, asked Williams if he could confirm or deny the claims that he was gay, and whether or not he had discussed possible resignation with Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney.
