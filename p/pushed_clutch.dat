50|$|With this method, {{instead of}} <b>pushing</b> the <b>clutch</b> in once and {{shifting}} directly to another gear, the driver first engages the transmission in neutral before shifting {{to the next}} gear. The clutch is pressed and released with each change.|$|R
50|$|Automatic {{transmissions}} can typically shift ratios {{faster than}} a manual gear change can be accomplished, due to the time required for the average driver to <b>push</b> the <b>clutch</b> pedal {{to the floor and}} move the gearstick from one position to another. This is especially true in regards to dual-clutch transmissions, which are specialized computer-controlled automatic transmissions that mechanically operate more like a manual transmission than a traditional automatic one.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method for}} {{speeding}} up the start was developed by Stirling Moss. His car was waiting with first gear already engaged. When he jumped in, he switched the starter on without depressing the clutch. The car was immediately jerked forward by the starter motor, but the engine did not start due to low RPM. After {{a few seconds of}} motion, he then <b>pushed</b> the <b>clutch</b> down, allowing the engine to speed up and start while the car was moving.|$|R
5000|$|New {{for this}} {{generation}} was a dual-range four-speed 4WD transmission with both hi/lo range gearing and manual ride height adjustment on the 4WD models. In November 1981 Subaru introduced Japan's first all-wheel-drive vehicle {{with an automatic}} transmission, utilizing the world's first [...] "wet hydraulic multi-plate clutch". This allowed the driver to engage 4WD with a simple {{push of a button}} rather than shifting a lever as in the manual models. The electric switch activated a solenoid that <b>pushed</b> the <b>clutch</b> plates together, thereby engaging the driveshaft to the rear wheels.|$|R
50|$|In its {{simplest}} form, the inchworm motor uses three piezo-actuators (2 and 3, see Figure 1.) mounted {{inside a}} tube (1) and electrified in sequence to grip a shaft (4) {{which is then}} moved in a linear direction. Motion of the shaft {{is due to the}} extension of the lateral piezo (2) <b>pushing</b> on two <b>clutching</b> piezos (3).|$|R
50|$|The R.VII, an {{incremental}} improvement on the almost identical Zeppelin-Staaken R.IV, had two engine pods, each with tandem pusher engines, {{large enough for}} some inflight maintenance by flight mechanics housed in cockpits forward of the nacelle engines, driving the large <b>pusher</b> propellers throuch <b>clutches,</b> gearboxes and shafts. A further two engines were mounted in {{the nose of the}} fuselage, driving a single tractor propeller in similar fashion.|$|R
50|$|Friction-disc {{clutches}} {{generally are}} classified as push type or pull type depending on {{the location of the}} pressure plate fulcrum points. In a pull-type clutch, the action of pressing the pedal pulls the release bearing, pulling on the diaphragm spring and disengaging the vehicle drive. The opposite is true with a push type, the release bearing is <b>pushed</b> into the <b>clutch</b> disengaging the vehicle drive. In this instance, the release bearing can be known as a thrust bearing (as per the image above).|$|R
50|$|<b>Pushing</b> the <b>clutch</b> pedal {{disengages}} {{the engine}} from the powertrain like wheels, drive shafts and gearbox. Releasing the accelerator makes the engine slowing down to idle. Turning of the ignition takes further affects. Pulling the key causes locking the steering wheel. Some vehicles drop head- or stoplights when ignition is turned off. After {{the engine is}} stopped, applying the brake longer time or give a few pushes to the brake releases the reserve of the vacuum servo, causing a lost of the brake support. A belt driven power steering fails immediately. Real hybrid vehicles have electric driven support of power steering and brake. Bigger engines and engines with higher compression ratio can cause damage to components of the powertrain at a rough start over clutch from gliding vehicles kinetic power or trailing drag. Using a higher gear decreases the torque force on the powertrain. By turning off the ignition the engine control unit (ECU) needs to detect the engine shafts position. Some ECUs need several rotations of the camshaft to detect ignition an injection timing points. Starting the engine in coldstart takes temporary more fuel until operation temperature of the engine is detected by the ECU.|$|R
5000|$|Suspended {{below the}} {{envelope}} a diamond-section keel constructed from steel tubing extended nearly the whole {{length of the}} envelope. This contained a horizontal stabilising surface for the front two-thirds of its length: the rear part also had a fixed vertical surface. It carried two pairs of elevators, one pair forward and the other aft, and a single rear-mounted rudder. [...] Below this the car, also made from steel tubes was suspended. This had a single landing pivot in the bow. and was divided into compartments and could carry 20 persons. Also inside the car were two Panhard four-cylinder water-cooled piston engines rated at 135 hp, driving a pair of two-bladed <b>pusher</b> propellers through <b>clutches</b> and a gearbox. The propellers, which rotated in opposite directions, were 16 ft 5in (5 m) in diameter and revolved at about {{one third of the}} engines' speed.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the evening}} of January 5, 1985 Lingar and his friend, Dave Smith, were {{drinking}} alcohol and driving around Doniphan, Missouri. They saw Thomas Allen's jeep, which had ran out of gas, parked {{at the side of}} the road. They offered to take him to a gas station and he accepted. After driving out of town, Lingar ordered Allen to undress. He then ordered Allen to masturbate, but Allen was too frightened to do so. Lingar then drove to his parents' home to retrieve a Winchester [...]22-caliber rifle. He then drove to a rural area, pointed the gun at Allen and again ordered him to masturbate. Allen asked to get out of the car to urinate, which Lingar and Smith allowed him to do. All three of them got out of the car, and Lingar shot Allen while Allen was urinating. Allen then got up, got into the car and started the ignition but the car stalled because Allen didn't <b>push</b> in the <b>clutch.</b> Lingar shot Allen three more times then, realizing Allen was still alive, Lingar retrieved a tire iron from the car's trunk and used it to beat Allen. After Lingar and Smith got back into the car they noticed that Allen was still alive. Lingar ran him over with the car and then sped away. Lingar and the Smith, after talking to Lingar's brother, then disposed of the body, dumping it over a bridge, and cleaned the car. They later pawned the car dumped the murder weapon on a country road in Kentucky.|$|R
