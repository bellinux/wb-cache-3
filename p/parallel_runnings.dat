Determination of the {{economic}} grounded sizes of motion of freight trains between the areas of railway direction with <b>parallel</b> <b>runnings.</b> A research task is distribution in the operative terms of train work at admission of freight trains between the areas of railway direction with <b>parallel</b> <b>runnings.</b> Methodology. Research is executed {{with the use of}} classic methods and methods of the linear programming. Findings. The rational train traffic volume distribution on a railway infrastructure with <b>parallel</b> <b>runnings</b> is presently carried out by an expert method on the basis of information about the before executed volumes of transportations without application of feasibility study. For the task solution of train traffic volume distribution between <b>parallel</b> <b>runnings</b> of railway direction a linear model and methods of the linear programming are used in operative terms. At a design all train traffic volume on a direction part on undistributed train traffic volume – which remaines unchanging for all variants of operative management and distributed – which it is possible to redistribute in some limits between <b>parallel</b> <b>runnings</b> of railway direction. Originality. From the scientific point of view the work is interesting and important by the methods of the linear programming, which allow conducting train traffic volume distribution between <b>parallel</b> <b>runnings</b> in operative terms. Practical value. The practical value of this research is in applying of the described economic and mathematical modeling methods of train traffic volume distribution between <b>parallel</b> <b>runnings</b> on direction Znamenka - Odessa. 10 pairs transmission of freight trains from basic direction Pomoshnaya – Kolosovka – Odessa on parallel direction Pomoshnaya - Kotovsk – Separate is Odessa can be included with the optimum variant...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Parallel</b> <b>running</b> {{is one of}} {{the ways}} to change from an {{existing}} system to a new one. This conversion takes place as the technology of the old system is outdated so a new system is needed to be installed to replace the old one. The phrase <b>parallel</b> <b>running</b> can refer to the process of changing a fragment of business information technology operation to a new system or to the technique applied by the human resources departments in which the existing staff stay on board during the transition to a new staff. It {{is one of the}} strategies for system implementation [...] in which both the old and new systems are running side by side until the users are certain that the new system has no problems. After a period of time, when the system is proved to be working correctly, the old system will be removed completely and users will depend solely on the new system.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Parallel</b> <b>running</b> allows {{results to}} be {{compared}} {{to ensure that the}} new system is working without any errors. If errors are found, user can refer to the old system to resolve the problem and make modifications to the new system thus operation can continue under the old system while the problems are sorted out. This also allows training of staff and help them to gain confidence in the new system.|$|R
50|$|Load can {{be shared}} among <b>parallel</b> <b>running</b> {{generators}} through load sharing.

A diesel generator will take more load when the fuel supply to its combustion system is increased, while load is released if fuel supply is decreased.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} simplify and {{optimize}} {{the operation of}} our home made torque magnetometer we created a new software system. The architecture is based on <b>parallel,</b> independently <b>running</b> instrument handlers communicating with a main control program. All programs are designed as command driven state machines which greatly simplifies their maintenance and expansion. Moreover, as the main program may receive commands {{not only from the}} user interface, but also from other <b>parallel</b> <b>running</b> programs, an easy way of automation is achieved. A program working through a text file containing a sequence of commands and sending them to the main program suffices to automatically have the system conduct a complex set of measurements. In this paper we describe the system's architecture and its implementation in LabVIEW. Comment: 6 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Rev. Sci. Inst...|$|R
