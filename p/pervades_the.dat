5|$|The second {{movement}} {{continues the}} major-minor tussle that <b>pervades</b> <b>the</b> {{work as a}} whole. It is in double variation form, with the first theme in A major and the second theme in A minor. Again the movement ends abruptly, with an A-major chord.|$|E
5|$|Discovery {{of active}} {{volcanic}} {{activity on the}} moon Io was probably the greatest surprise. It {{was the first time}} active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the Solar System. It appears that activity on Io affects the entire Jovian system. Io appears to be the primary source of matter that <b>pervades</b> <b>the</b> Jovian magnetosphere – the region of space that surrounds the planet influenced by the planet's strong magnetic field. Sulfur, oxygen, and sodium, apparently erupted by Io's volcanoes and sputtered off the surface by impact of high-energy particles, were detected at {{the outer edge of the}} magnetosphere of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert White's Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789) holds {{a unique}} {{position}} in English literature as the solitary classic of natural history. It {{is not easy to}} give, in a few words, a reason for its remarkable success. It is, in fact, not so much a logically arranged and systematic book as an invaluable record of the life work of a simple and refined man who succeeded in picturing himself as well as what he saw. The reader is carried along by his interest in the results of far-sighted observation; but, more than this, the reader imbibes the spirit of the writer which <b>pervades</b> <b>the</b> whole book and endears it to like-minded naturalists as a valued companion.|$|E

5|$|This {{movement}} is {{prompted by the}} feeling that <b>pervades</b> <b>the</b> citizens of this State that in the present emergency the arms and munitions {{of war in the}} Arsenal should be {{under the control of the}} State authorities, in order to their security. This movement, although not authorized by me, has assumed such an aspect that it becomes my duty, as the executive of this Sate, to interpose my official authority to prevent a collision between the people of the State and the Federal troops under your command. I therefore demand in the name of the State the delivery of the possession of the Arsenal and munitions of war under your charge to the State authorities, to be held subject to the action of the convention to be held on the 4th of March next.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Artillery Monument {{attempted}} {{a very different}} effect. Jagger takes a realist approach to his figures, embracing detailed images of military power {{with none of the}} classical symbolism of other monuments, or even Jagger's own pre-war pieces. The art historian Reginald Wilenski likens the memorial to the work of Frank Brangwyn, who focused on depicting the physical labour of soldiers and workers during the war. The memorial shows the three upright bronze figures stood at ease, rather than to attention; the driver even leans back against the parapet, his cape hanging over his outstretched arms, suggesting an attitude of exhaustion or contemplation. The faceless, heavily laden statue of the fallen soldier appears less at rest than tired, pulled down as if by a great weight. At the same time, the sheer size of the memorial, including the oversized gun and the larger-than-life bronze figures, exudes a sense of strength and power; the figures are stocky, confident and imposing. This strength and power contributes to the sense of masculinity that <b>pervades</b> <b>the</b> work, from the phallic image of the howitzer, to the solid, muscular figures of the gunners.|$|E

25|$|The Pancaratra Samhitas (literally, five nights) is a {{genre of}} texts where Vishnu is {{presented}} as Narayana and Vasudeva, and this genre of Vaishnava texts {{is also known as}} the Vaishnava Agamas. Its doctrines are found embedded in the stories within the Narayaniya section of the Mahabharata. Narayana {{is presented as}} the ultimate unchanging truth and reality (Brahman), who <b>pervades</b> <b>the</b> entirety of the universe and is asserted to be the preceptor of all religions.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a disease}} which always makes it first attack on the {{inferior}} part of the scrotum where it produces a superficial, painful ragged ill-looking sore with hard rising edges... in no great length of time it <b>pervades</b> <b>the</b> skin, dartos and the membranes of the scrotum, and seizes the testicle, which it inlarges(sic), hardens and renders truly and thoroughly distempered. Whence it makes its way up the spermatic process into the abdomen.|$|E
25|$|Scholars {{debate whether}} hair-straightening {{practices}} arose out of Black desires {{to conform to}} a Eurocentric standard of beauty, {{or as part of}} their individual experiments with fashions and changing styles. Some believe that slaves and later African-Americans absorbed prejudices of the European slaveholders and colonizers, who considered most slaves as second-class, as they were not citizens. Ayana Byrd and Lori Tharp say that they believe the preference for Eurocentric ideas of beauty still <b>pervades</b> <b>the</b> Western world.|$|E
25|$|Philo {{probably}} {{was the first}} philosopher who identified Plato’s Ideas with Creator’s thoughts. These thoughts make the contents of Logos; they were the seals for making sensual things during world creation. Logos resembles a book with creature paradigms. Architect’s design before {{the construction of a}} city serves to Philo as another simile of Logos. Since creation, Logos binds things together. As the receptacle and holder of ideas, Logos is distinct from the material world. At the same time, Logos <b>pervades</b> <b>the</b> world, supporting it.|$|E

25|$|In the Discourses, love is {{mentioned}} in many forms. Love <b>pervades</b> <b>the</b> universe. The first fundamental force {{known to have}} split as an independent principle from the original primordial unity in recent Cosmology is gravity. Baba says that gravity is the reflection of love. All the forces of attraction and of repulsion in every level (from small particles to material objects to living organisms) are expressions of love. In the animal kingdom this love becomes explicit in conscious processes through instinctive drives. The drive to look for nutrition is love. Sex-attraction is love. Actually anything that drives an organism to fulfill a bodily impulse or desire is love.|$|E
25|$|Happily, Gossaert {{was capable}} of higher efforts. His St Luke {{painting}} the portrait of the Virgin in Sanct Veit at Prague, a variety of the same subject in the Belvedere at Vienna, the Madonna of the Baring collection in London, or the numerous repetitions of Christ and the scoffers (Ghent and Antwerp), all prove that travel had left many of Gossaert's fundamental peculiarities unaltered. His figures still retain the character of stone; his architecture is as rich and varied, his tones are as strong as ever. But bright contrasts of gaudy tints are replaced by soberer greys; and a cold haze, the sfumato of the Milanese, <b>pervades</b> <b>the</b> surfaces. It is but seldom that these features fail to obtrude. When they least show, the master displays a brilliant palette combined with smooth surface and incisive outlines. In this form the Madonnas of Munich and Vienna (1527), the likeness of a girl weighing gold pieces (Berlin), and the portraits {{of the children of}} the king of Denmark at Hampton Court, are fair specimens of his skill.|$|E
25|$|Time is {{a natural}} force from which {{none of us is}} immune. This theme <b>pervades</b> <b>the</b> sonnet; the speaker recognizes that time will strip the beloved of his beauty and by saying that implies that time will take his beloved from him. Eventually, time will consume {{everyone}} in death, and, whether one chooses to recognize it or not, he will not have any control over exactly when that consumption will take place. This theme translates to Julius Caesar as well. Caesar is unfazed by the soothsayer's proclamation in act one, and even though Calpurnia seems for a time to have succeeded in keeping Caesar home on the day of his eventual murder, he goes to Senate anyway. Caesar walks into his own death, much less literally than Brutus, who does actually walk into the sword that kills him. But in these deaths {{in the context of the}} play serve to elucidate the truth that death (or 'Time', as the sonnet refers to it) will consume you regardless of your ambitions or future plans; it does not take you into consideration. Obviously, Caesar would not have gone to Senate if he knew he would be stabbed upon entering, just as Brutus and Cassius would not have engaged in a full-blown war if they knew they would be dead before it was over.|$|E

500|$|Although he {{experienced}} early literary success, Holmes {{did not consider}} turning to a literary profession.
