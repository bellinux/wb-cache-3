5000|$|Limberger and Oliveira [...] {{suggested}} a deterministic technique for <b>plane</b> <b>detection</b> in unorganized point clouds whose cost is [...] {{in the number}} of samples, achieving real-time performance for relatively large datasets (up to [...] points on a 3.4 GHz CPU). It is based on a fast Hough-transform voting strategy for planar regions, inspired by the Kernel-based Hough transform (KHT). This 3D Kernel-based Hough transform (3DKHT) uses a fast and robust algorithm to segment clusters of approximately co-planar samples, and casts votes for individual clusters (instead of for individual samples) on a (...) spherical accumulator using a trivariate Gaussian kernel. The approach is several orders of magnitude faster than existing (non-deterministic) techniques for <b>plane</b> <b>detection</b> in point clouds, such as RHT and RANSAC, and scales better with the size of the datasets. It can be used with any application that requires fast detection of planar features on large datasets.|$|E
5000|$|For {{generalized}} <b>plane</b> <b>detection</b> using Hough transform, {{the plane}} can be parametrized by its normal vector [...] (using spherical coordinates) and its {{distance from the}} origin [...] resulting in a three dimensional Hough space. This results in each point in the input data voting for a sinusoidal surface in the Hough space. The intersection of these sinusoidal surfaces indicates presence of a plane. A more general approach for more than 3 dimensions requires search heuristics to remain feasible.|$|E

The first detector module comprises a first detection region {{lying in a}} first <b>detection</b> <b>plane,</b> and the second detector module comprises a second detection region lying in a second <b>detection</b> <b>plane,</b> which second <b>detection</b> region is adjacent to the first detection region. The manipulation device is designed to align the first <b>detection</b> <b>plane</b> of the first detector module with the second <b>detection</b> <b>plane</b> of the second detector module such that a first surface normal of the first <b>detection</b> <b>plane</b> and a second surface normal of the second <b>detection</b> <b>plane</b> intersect in a reference region...|$|R

30|$|As the {{relative}} curvatures between the wavefronts change during the propagation, {{it can be}} seen that the OPDs at the <b>plane</b> of <b>detection</b> also depend on the actual position of the detector.|$|R
5000|$|Hough {{transform}} {{can also}} be used for the detection of 3D objects in range data or 3D point clouds. The extension of classical Hough transform for <b>plane</b> <b>detection</b> is quite straightforward. A plane is represented by its explicit equation [...] for which we can use a 3D Hough space corresponding to , [...] and [...] This extension suffers from the same problems as its 2D counterpart i.e., near horizontal planes can be reliably detected, while the performance deteriorates as planar direction becomes vertical (big values of [...] and [...] amplify the noise in the data). This formulation of the plane has been used for the detection of planes in the point clouds acquired from airborne laser scanning [...] and works very well because in that domain all planes are nearly horizontal.|$|E

RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is widely used for <b>plane</b> <b>detection</b> in point cloud data. Minimum description length (MDL) principle is used to deal with several competing hypothesis. This paper presents a new approach to the <b>plane</b> <b>detection</b> by integrating RANSAC and MDL.

40|$|A {{scheme is}} {{proposed}} for ground <b>plane</b> obstacle <b>detection</b> {{under conditions of}} variable camera geometry. It uses a predictive stereo matcher implemented in the PILUT architecture described below, in which is encoded the disparity map of the ground plane for the different viewing positions required to scan the work space. The research is the extension of Mallot et al's (1989) scheme for ground <b>plane</b> obstacle <b>detection</b> which begins with an inverse perspective mapping of {{the left and right}} images that transforms the image locations of all points arising from the ground plane so that they have zero disparity: simple differencing of the resulting images then permits ready detection of obstacles. The essence of this physiologically-inspired method is to exploit knowledge of the prevailing camera geometry (to find epipolar lines) and the expectation of a ground plane (to predict the locations along epipolars of corresponding left/right image points of features arising from the ground plane). ...|$|R

In order to provide useful services, robots must not only identify different objects but also understand their use {{and be able to}} extract characteristics that make useful an object. In this work, a framework is presented for recognize home furniture by analyzing geometrical features over point clouds. A fast and efficient method for horizontal and vertical <b>planes</b> <b>detection</b> is presented, based on the histograms of 3 D points acquired from a Kinect like sensor onboard the robot. Horizontal planes are recovered according to height distribution on 2 D histograms, while vertical planes with a similar approach over a projection on the floor (3 D histograms).

40|$|This study aims {{to extract}} {{automatically}} building roof planes from airborne LIDAR data applying an extended 3 D Randomized Hough Transform (RHT). The proposed methodology {{consists of three}} main steps, namely detection of building points, <b>plane</b> <b>detection</b> and refinement. For the detection of the building points, the vegetative areas are first segmented from the scene content and the bare earth is extracted afterwards. The automatic <b>plane</b> <b>detection</b> of each building is performed applying extensions of the RHT associated with additional constraint criteria during the random selection of the 3 points aiming at the optimum adaptation to the building rooftops as well as using a simple design of the accumulator that efficiently detects the prominent planes. The refinement of the <b>plane</b> <b>detection</b> is conducted based {{on the relationship between}} neighbouring planes, the locality of the point and the use of additional information. An indicative experimental comparison to verify the advantages of the extended RHT compared to the 3 D Standard Hough Transform (SHT) is implemented as well as the sensitivity of the proposed extensions and accumulator design is examined in the view of quality and computational time compared to the default RHT. Further, a comparison between the extended RHT and the RANSAC is carried out. The <b>plane</b> <b>detection</b> results illustrate the potential of the proposed extended RHT in terms of robustness and efficiency for several applications...|$|E

We introduce a very simple but robust ground <b>plane</b> <b>detection</b> method based on depth information obtained using anRGB-Depth sensor. We present two different variations of the method: the simplest one is robust in setups where the sensor pitch angle is fixed and has no roll, whereas the second one can handle changes in pitch and roll angles. Our comparisons show that our approach performs better than the vertical disparity approach. It produces accurate ground plane-obstacle segmentation for difficult scenes, which include many obstacles, different floor surfaces, stairs, and narrow corridors.

40|$|Accurate {{detection}} of mitosis plays {{a critical role}} in breast cancer histopathology. Manual detection and counting of mitosis is tedious and subject to considerable inter- and intra-reader variations. Multispectral imaging is a recent medical imaging technology, proven successful in increasing the segmentation accuracy in other fields. This study aims at improving the accuracy of mitosis detection by developing a specific solution using multispectral and multifocal imaging of breast cancer histopathological data. We propose to enable clinical routine-compliant quality of mitosis discrimination from other objects. The proposed framework includes comprehensive analysis of spectral bands and z-stack focus <b>planes,</b> <b>detection</b> of expected mitotic regions (candidates) in selected focus planes and spectral bands, computation of multispectral spatial features for each candidate, selection of multispectral spatial features and a study of different state-of-the-art classification methods for candidates classification as mitotic or non mitotic figures. This framework has been evaluated on MITOS multispectral medical dataset and achieved 60 % detection rate and 57 % F-Measure. Our results indicate that multispectral spatial features have more information for mitosis classification in comparison with white spectral band features, being therefore a very promising exploration area {{to improve the quality of}} the diagnosis assistance in histopathology...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{considerable}} amount of research, brain symmetry <b>plane</b> <b>detection</b> is still an open problem. In this paper, we present a novel method for symmetry <b>plane</b> <b>detection</b> in magnetic resonance (MR) neuroimages based on the textural information and underlying brain's physiological structure. Fractal dimension and lacunarity analysis are used to locate the symmetry plane of the brain. The method was tested on MR data while analyzing the robustness against intensity non-uniformity, noise, and pathology. The proposed method does not need skull-stripping like pre-processing of MR images. The method was compared with another commonly used technique. The results were evaluated by an expert.

30|$|To detect {{continuous}} planes, Hulik et al. [9] optimised a 3 D Hough transform {{to extract}} large planes from LiDAR and Kinect RGB-D datasets. Using a Gaussian smoothing function, the {{noise in the}} Hough space was removed to preserve {{the accuracy of the}} <b>plane</b> <b>detection</b> process. In order to speed up the Hough space updating process, a caching technique was applied for point registration. Compared with the traditional <b>plane</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm Compared Random sample consensus (RANSAC) [10], the 3 D Hough transform performed faster and was more stable. During the maxima extraction process from the Hough space, this method applied a sliding window technique with a pre-computed Gaussian kernel. When dense noise exists surrounding a line, more than one peak is extracted in a connected segmented region using this method. In order to maintain stable line estimation, this paper applied a CCL algorithm to preserve only one peak extracted in one distinguishable region [11].|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{problem in}} computer vision is {{the interpretation of}} the content of a single image. In our work we investigated the challenging case of recovering the underlying 3 D structure of a scene from a single image, by learning from trainig data. Toward this, we developed a <b>plane</b> <b>detection</b> algorithm, which is able to find planar surfaces in a single still image and estimate their orientation with respect to the camera. This comprises two parts: a plane recognition stage, to classify individual regions as being planar or not, and to estimate their orienation; followed by a Markov-random field based segmentation stage to find distinct planes in the image. We also demonstrated an application of this to visual odometry, where single-image <b>plane</b> <b>detection</b> allows structure-rich maps to be built quickly.  (Please note that this abstract does not appear in the submitted article itself, since that is itself an extended thesis abstract!

40|$|Differential Semblance Optimization (DSO) {{is a novel}} way of {{approaching}} a class of inverse problems arising in exploration seismology. The promising feature of the DSO method is that it replaces a nonsmooth, highly nonconvex cost function (the Output Least-Squares (OLS) objective function) with a smooth cost function that is amenable to standard (local) optimization algorithms. The OLS problem can be written abstractly as a partially linear least-squares problem with linear constraints. The DSO objective function {{is derived from the}} associated quadratic penalty function. It is shown that one way to view the DSO objective function is as a regularization of a function that is dual (in a certain sense) to the OLS objective function. By viewing the DSO problem as a perturbation of this dual problem, this method can be shown to be effective. In particular, it is demonstrated that, under suitable assumptions, the DSO method defines a parameterized path of minimizers converging to the desired solution, and that for certain values of the parameter, standard optimization techniques can be used to find a point on the path. The predictions of the theory are motivated and illustrated on two simple model problems for seismic velocity inversion, the <b>plane</b> wave <b>detection</b> problem and the "layer-over-half-space" problem. It is shown that the theory presented in this thesis extends the existing theory for the <b>plane</b> wave <b>detection</b> problem...|$|R
30|$|The second way {{to analyze}} the data was to {{reconstruct}} the momentum transfer in the detector plane by exploiting the rotational symmetry around the electron impact direction. Using all events we obtained the projection of all momenta on the detector plane. The projection of a cylindrically symmetrical object on a plane that contains the symmetry axis is an Abel transformation [31]. In the experiment, the symmetry axis was along the electron impact direction in y-direction and the projection <b>plane</b> was the <b>detection</b> <b>plane,</b> i.e. the x-y plane. The original distribution was reconstructed using the inverse Abel transform [30]. Here, the results are independent of the velocity distribution in the jet and show better momentum resolution in x- and y-direction. These results are compared to a simulation where scattering was confined to the detector plane, thus eliminating the jet velocity distribution from the calculations.|$|R

30|$|For {{detecting}} slowly-moving vessels, OTH radar requires broader bandwidth {{than that}} in <b>plane</b> <b>detection,</b> since the Doppler shifts of ship echoes coincide within the spectrum range of sea clutter, which makes adequate signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) essentially important for ship detection [6]. Broad bandwidth reduces the range resolution of sea scatter cell size so as to improve the SCR [7]. However, when OTH radar employs wideband signal, the broad-occupying bandwidth increases the possibility of encountering cochannel interference.|$|E
