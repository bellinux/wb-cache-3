5|$|East Asian {{cultures}} have traditionally seen long, unkempt {{hair in a}} woman {{as a sign of}} sexual intent or a recent sexual encounter, as usually their hair is tied up in styles such as the ponytail, <b>plait,</b> or any bun.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{inaccuracies}} in Gravity, Tyson, <b>Plait</b> and Parazynski {{said they}} enjoyed watching the film. Aldrin {{said he hoped}} that the film would stimulate the public to find an interest in space again, after decades of diminishing investments into advancements in the field.|$|E
5|$|The textural hues and {{schemes that}} Delaroche uses in this {{painting}} are quite detailed and well considered, {{especially in regards to}} the most important figures; such aspects of the work were described as being '...rendered with a fidelity that has not omitted the <b>plait</b> of a drapery, the shaggy texture of the four-footed animal, nor a detail of the harness on his back'.|$|E

5000|$|Straw can be <b>plaited</b> for {{a number}} of purposes, including: the thatching of roofs, to create a paper-making material, for ornamenting small {{surfaces}} as a [...] "straw-mosaic", for <b>plaiting</b> into door and table mats, mattresses and for weaving and <b>plaiting</b> into light baskets and to create artificial flowers. Straw is also <b>plaited</b> to produce bonnets and hats.|$|R

5|$|Another claim {{involved}} alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, {{first published}} in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil <b>Plait</b> noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, {{it would have had}} to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived. In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.|$|E
5|$|Lara Croft is {{depicted}} as an athletic and fast woman with brown eyes and reddish-brown hair, frequently kept in a <b>plait</b> or ponytail. The character's classic costume is a turquoise tank top, light brown shorts, calf-high boots, and tall white socks. Accessories include fingerless gloves, a backpack, a utility belt with holsters on either side, and two pistols. The video game sequels introduced new outfits designed for different environments, such as underwater and cold weather. In the later games, Croft wears a crop top, camouflage pants and black or light brown shirts. When exploring, she often carries two pistols, but has used other weaponry throughout the series. She is fluent in several languages.|$|E
5|$|Several {{observers}} (including <b>Plait</b> and Tyson) {{said that}} in the scene in which Kowalski unclips his tether and floats away to his death to save Stone from being pulled away from the ISS, Stone would simply need to tug the tether gently to pull Kowalski toward her. According to the film's science adviser Kevin Grazier and NASA engineer Robert Frost, however, the pair are still decelerating with Stone's leg caught in the parachute cords from the Soyuz. The cords stretch as they absorb her kinetic energy. Kowalski thinks that the cords are not strong enough to absorb his kinetic energy as well as hers, and that he must release the tether to give Stone a chance of stopping before the cords fail and doom both of them.|$|E
50|$|All ponies {{apart from}} the Heritage Mountain and Moorland ponies must have their manes <b>plaited,</b> with tails either <b>plaited</b> or neatly pulled.|$|R
50|$|It {{traditionally}} has nine thongs {{as a result}} of the manner in which rope is <b>plaited.</b> Thinner rope is made from three strands of yarn <b>plaited</b> together, and thicker rope from three strands of thinner rope <b>plaited</b> together. To make a cat o' nine tails, a rope is unravelled into three small ropes, each of which is unravelled again.|$|R
25|$|Modern slings are {{begun by}} <b>plaiting</b> the cord for the finger loop {{in the center}} of a double-length set of cords. The cords are then folded to form the finger-loop. The cords are <b>plaited</b> as a single cord to the pocket. The pocket is then <b>plaited,</b> most simply as another pair of cords, or with flat braids or a woven net. The {{remainder}} of the sling is <b>plaited</b> as a single cord, and then finished with a knot. Braided construction resists stretching, and therefore produces an accurate sling.|$|R
5|$|The {{proposed}} redefinition was criticised as ambiguous: Astronomer Phil <b>Plait</b> and NCSE writer Nick Matzke both {{wrote about}} why they thought the redefinition was not, in general, a good one. It defined a planet as orbiting a star, which would have meant that any planet ejected from its star system or formed outside of one (a rogue planet) {{could not have been}} called a planet, even if it fit all other definitions. A similar situation already applied to the term 'moon', such bodies ceasing to be moons on being ejected from planetary orbit; this usage had widespread acceptance. Similarly, the redefinition did not differentiate between planets and brown dwarf stars. Any attempt to clarify this differentiation was to be left until a later date.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{nothing of}} the {{original}} church—built {{on the site of}} a wooden Saxon church—remains, apart from unique examples of Celtic stonework, including a <b>plait</b> interweave and a bas-relief of the Virgin and Child, which was carved around 1000 AD. The current building still has a quoin, which was probably a re-cycled Anglo-Saxon cross shaft. The stone southern entrance to the church still stands; it was built in the 12th century and is a typical example of Norman stonework. The church was re-consecrated in 1287 by the bishop of Candida Casa under the direction of John le Romeyn, Archbishop of York. The tall windows set in the church wall both north and south of the nave can be dated to approximately 1320 to 1330, and in the top sections of two of the windows, small fragments of medieval glass can be found. A sideways orientated tombstone can be found under a low arch {{on the inside of the}} southern wall, generally believed to be that of Sir Richard Pickering (d. 1441), a member of the Pickering family who ruled the village of Oswaldkirk from the 14th century into the 16th century.|$|E

40|$|Soft {{clay soil}} is type of {{cohesive}} soil that has low value of shear strengthand high compressibility. The solution {{to fix the}} soil properties is by adding geocell, but because geocell is an expensive product sowe are searching other material that alike geocell but have more economical price, then we use cylinder basket <b>plaited</b> rattan. This study goals are to know soil bearing capacity with using cylinder basket <b>plaited</b> rattan as geocellat foundation reinforcement on soft clay soil and to compare the result of soil deformation on before and after adding cylinder basket <b>plaited</b> rattan geocell. The result {{of this study is}} indicate there is significant decrease on loading soil that use the cylinder basket <b>plaited</b> rattan than the soil that don???t use the cylinder basket <b>plaited</b> rattan that modified as geocell. Soil deformation that reinforced by cylinder basket <b>plaited</b> rattan that modified as geocell is reduce 72. 13 % than soil deformation without reinforcement...|$|R

An odd number of <b>plaits</b> is traditional, {{although}} judges have become more relaxed about this in recent years. The number of <b>plaits</b> can be increased or decreased, {{depending on whether the}} rider wants the horse's neck to look longer or shorter.|$|R
