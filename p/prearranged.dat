At about 08:00 infantry units of the 54th (East Anglian) Division at Khurbet Hadrah were ordered back across the river. It was an extremely difficult operation as the bridge was now being swept by enemy fire and continuously shelled by artillery. Some individuals succeeded in crossing the bridge; some swam the river and some drowned. Once the infantry were clear, the 3rd Squadron, Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment followed them across the bridge.

5|$|In {{what was}} {{according}} to coach Lou Holtz a <b>prearranged</b> move, New York Jets rookie quarterback Richard Todd {{was replaced by}} Joe Namath {{late in the first}} quarter. Namath responded with a passing display that gave the Jets a 24–0 halftime lead. Saying that his players were “polite” to Namath, coach McKay compared the Buccaneers to a junior-high team, and said that the only thing they did better than the Jets was to be the first team on the field after halftime. Clark Gaines rushed for 103 yards for the Jets. The Buccaneers’ three quarterbacks combined for 171 yards passing, more than the Jets’ quarterbacks, but the Buccaneers failed to score for the fourth time in the season. As the score rose, the press box announcer began calling out records set during the game, which included the Jets’ first shutout in Shea Stadium. This was considered to be the Buccaneers’ last good chance to win a game, with the next four opponents all in playoff contention. The Jets’ 34 points were nearly a third of their season total of 110 after ten games, and a fifth of their season total of 169.|$|E

On September 27, Truman saw through his binoculars an enemy artillery battery setting up across a river in a position allowing them to fire upon the neighboring 28th Division. Truman's orders limited him to targets facing the 35th Division, but he ignored this and patiently waited until the Germans had walked their horses well away from their guns, ensuring they could not relocate out of range of Truman's battery, and then he ordered his men to open fire. The enemy battery was destroyed. His actions were credited with saving the lives of 28th Division soldiers who otherwise would have come under fire from the Germans. Truman was given a dressing down by his regimental commander, Colonel Karl D. Klemm, but he was not court-martialed or otherwise punished.|$|E

Compared with conventional power generations, wind power is fluctuating, intermittent, and of low energy density. For the grid integrating with large-scale wind farms, wind power fluctuations will lead to upset the equilibrium of power supply and demand, and even endanger {{the safety of the}} grid. The curtailment of wind power is implemented to insure power system safety, which decreases the utilization rate of wind power [3].

Students were involved in several demonstrations, culminating on 13 March when they cheered the royal family but voiced anger at Metternich. After a customary morning, Metternich was called to meet with Archduke Ludwig soon after midday. The Chancellor had troops sent into the streets while also announcing a <b>prearranged</b> and minimal concession. In the afternoon the crowd turned hostile, and a division of troops opened fire on it, killing five. The mob was now truly incited, as the liberals were joined by underprivileged Viennese set on wreaking havoc. The students offered to form a pro-government Academic Legion if their demands were met. Ludwig was eager to accept and told Metternich he must resign, to which he reluctantly agreed. After sleeping in the Chancellery he was advised to either take back his resignation or leave the city. After Ludwig sent him {{a message to the}} effect that the government could not guarantee his safety, Metternich left for the house of Count Taaffe and then, with aid from friends Charles von Hügel and Johann Rechberg, reached the family seat of Prince Liechtenstein forty miles away at Feldsberg. Metternich's daughter Leontine joined them on 21 March and suggested England as a haven; agreeing, Metternich, Melanie and 19-year-old Richard set out, leaving the younger children with Leontine. Metternich's resignation had been met with cheering in Vienna, and even the Viennese commoners welcomed the end of Metternich's era of social conservatism.|$|E

40|$|Considering {{the dynamic}} changes in agrifood systems in {{developing}} countries, this study uses a stated choice model {{to explore the}} marketing preferences of small-scale producers of {{fresh fruits and vegetables}} in Honduras. Eight attributes, proposed in hypothetical contracts to farmers, are evaluated. The results suggest that farmers have strong marketing preferences associated with new supply chains, such as <b>prearranging</b> prices and quantities with buyers, but have remaining preferences for some attributes of traditional spot markets, such as the lack of grading produce, receiving cash payments, lack of delivery schedules, ability to sell at the farm gate, and ability to sell individually. Further, farmers prefer market channels that do not require major upfront investments. The results suggest that the traditional marketing preferences of farmers could impede participation of small-holders in emerging supply chains and take advantage of the potential opportunities that new agrifood supply chains can offer.

40|$|Abstract—Introducing mobile {{sinks into}} {{wireless}} sensor net-works improves {{energy efficiency and}} prolongs network lifetime. Mobile sinks are also in demand in many sensor network applica-tions. However, sink mobility causes frequent topology changes, resulting in high packet loss rate and poor energy efficiency. A directional-antenna-assisted reactive routing protocol, namely, in-terest dissemination with directional antennas (IDDA), is proposed to solve this problem. Different from traditional interest diffusion routing protocols, IDDA exploits the directional antenna on the mobile sink to <b>prearrange</b> interest dissemination along the direc-tion of motion. The antenna directionality and the transmission power can indicate {{the motion of the}} mobile sink. An analytical model is established to calculate the optimal width of the antenna beam pattern and the optimal transmitting power. The multiple IDDA scheme, which is an enhancement to IDDA that can further improve network performance, is also presented. Extensive simu-lation results show that IDDA outperforms the traditional directed diffusion protocol, which guarantees that IDDA can be applied to sensor networks with highly mobile data sinks.
