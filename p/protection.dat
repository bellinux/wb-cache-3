5|$|A {{number of}} sea anemone species are {{commensal}} with other organisms. Certain crabs and hermit crabs seek out sea anemones {{and place them}} on their shells for <b>protection,</b> and fish, shrimps and crabs live among the anemone's tentacles, gaining <b>protection</b> by being {{in close proximity to}} the stinging cells. Some amphipods live inside the coelenteron of the sea anemone. Despite their venomous cells, sea anemones are eaten by fish, starfish, worms, sea spiders and molluscs. The sea slug Aeolidia papillosa feeds on the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), accumulating the nematocysts for its own <b>protection.</b>|$|E

40|$|When the Eighth Amendment was ratified, {{common law}} <b>protections</b> categorically {{prohibited}} {{the execution of}} “idiots. ” On two occasions, the Supreme Court considered whether these <b>protections</b> proscribe executing people with intellectual disabilities; however, the Court concluded that idiocy <b>protections</b> shielded only the “profoundly or severely mentally retarded. ” This Note argues that the Court’s historical analysis of idiocy <b>protections</b> was unduly narrow. It then proceeds to reassess common law insanity <b>protections</b> for idiots and finds strong evidence that these <b>protections</b> included people with a relatively wide range of intellectual disabilities. Based on this new historical account, this Note argues {{that there are people}} with intellectual disabilities on death row today who likely would have been protected from execution in 1791...|$|R
5|$|Apart from {{traditional}} applications, iron {{is also used}} for <b>protection</b> from ionizing radiation.

50|$|In {{addition}} to restricting benefits to couples in domestic partnerships, the amendment could have also stripped <b>protections</b> for unmarried couples such as {{domestic violence and}} stalking <b>protections.</b> If the courts had determined that the language used in the amendment invalidates <b>protections</b> for unmarried couples it could have harmed domestic-violence <b>protections</b> for that population. After passing a similar constitutional amendment in Ohio, several courts ruled that domestic violence <b>protections</b> {{did not apply to}} unmarried couples and cases were dismissed or told not to press charges. The courts could have determined that validation of unmarried couples domestic legal union status would violate the amendment. However, the counter argument was that North Carolina's domestic-violence statutes were better defined and included <b>protections</b> for unmarried couples.|$|R

5|$|Efforts made {{by local}} {{authorities}} in the Cluj-Napoca district {{at the end of}} the 1990s to reform the <b>protection</b> of children's rights and assistance for street children proved insufficient due to lack of funding, incoherent policies and the absence of any real collaboration between the actors involved (Child Rights <b>Protection</b> Directorate, Social Assistance Service within the District Directorate for Labour and Social <b>Protection,</b> Minors Receiving Centre, Guardian Authority within the City Hall, Police). There are numerous street children, whose poverty and lack of documented identity brings them into constant conflict with local law enforcement.|$|E

40|$|The {{system of}} human subjects' <b>protections</b> has {{recently}} gone through many changes. Overtly, the structural and functional changes are justified by rhetorical claims of increasing <b>protections</b> for research subjects. Yet, change represents {{an opportunity for}} a restructuring of the system in ways not immediately obvious. So, despite rhetorical claims of increased <b>protections</b> for subjects, what problems are delineated and how is the system of human subjects' <b>protections</b> constituted? Examination of the structure and functioning of the system, utilizing a blend of social constructivism, science and technology theories, and power theories, as well as a multi-layered, multi-dimensional examination of the system of human subjects' <b>protections</b> points to multiple social actors with many different interests. Many of these actors claim to speak for the subjects; however the subjects themselves do not speak in venues where policy is decided. Many problematic aspects of the system of human subjects' <b>protections</b> are delineated; however, few of the problematic aspects were addressed by the recent structural and functional changes made to the system. Overall, the current structural and functional aspects of the system of human subjects' <b>protections</b> do not necessarily support rhetorical claims of increased <b>protections</b> for subjects. As the system came under pressure from public scrutiny, the adjustments which followed tended to benefit institutional interests rather than human subjects...|$|R

5|$|Finally, the Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} if free speech is to be favoured over the <b>protection</b> of reputation in applying a Reynolds-type defence, another issue {{that will have to}} be considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests. In this connection, Chan C.J. said that the court would have to decide whether freedom of expression is to be given preference over the <b>protection</b> of reputation, whether it is a fundamental right that trumps the <b>protection</b> of reputation unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously, or whether it is co-equal with the <b>protection</b> of reputation.|$|E
5|$|Führer Schutzkommando ("Führer <b>Protection</b> Command"; FSK) was a <b>protection</b> unit {{founded by}} Himmler in March 1933. Originally charged with {{protecting}} the Führer only {{while he was}} inside the borders of Bavaria, its members consisted of police detectives of the Bavarian police and ministry. In the spring of 1934, they replaced the SS-Begleitkommando for Hitler's overall <b>protection</b> throughout Germany. The FSK was renamed the Reichssicherheitsdienst ("Reich Security Service"; RSD) in August 1935. Thereafter, the RSD and FBK worked together for security and <b>protection</b> during trips and public events, but they operated as two groups and used separate vehicles. Johann Rattenhuber, chief of the RSD, was in overall command and the current FBK chief acted as his deputy.|$|E

The labor <b>protections,</b> however, may be costly to transit management in other ways.

40|$|A congressional {{subcommittee}} held "union democracy" {{hearings in}} 1998 and 1999 {{to debate the}} impact and effectiveness of the union-democracy <b>protections</b> provided by the Landrum-Griffin Act which provides union members {{in the private sector}} and U. S. Postal Service certain democratic rights and <b>protections.</b> What was not resolved at that hearing was whether state sector or public employee union members should also enjoy the same democracy <b>protections.</b> We survey the existing 28 state sector collective bargaining laws and find that the majority of state legislation falls considerably short of the <b>protections</b> provided by the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act. Moreover, the consequences of limited state-enacted union-democracy <b>protections</b> are discussed and assessed to determine whether LMRDA jurisdiction should also cover public sector union members. ...|$|R
