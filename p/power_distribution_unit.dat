40|$|This paper {{presents}} a deterministic approach for performance assessment and optimization of <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>units</b> in Iran. The deterministic approach {{is composed of}} data envelopment analysis (DEA), principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation techniques. Seventeen electricity <b>distribution</b> <b>units</b> have been considered {{for the purpose of}} this study. Previous studies have generally used input-output DEA models for benchmarking and evaluation of electricity <b>distribution</b> <b>units.</b> However, this study considers an integrated deterministic DEA-PCA approach since the DEA model should be verified and validated by a robust multivariate methodology such as PCA. Moreover, the DEA models are verified and validated by PCA, Spearman and Kendall's Tau correlation techniques, while previous studies do not have the verification and validation features. Also, both input- and output-oriented DEA models are used for sensitivity analysis of the input and output variables. Finally, this is the first study to present an integrated deterministic approach for assessment and optimization of <b>power</b> <b>distributions</b> in Iran.

5000|$|Spacecraft need an {{electrical}} power generation and distribution subsystem for powering the various spacecraft subsystems. For spacecraft near the Sun, solar panels are frequently {{used to generate}} electrical power. Spacecraft designed to operate in more distant locations, for example Jupiter, might employ a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) to generate electrical power. Electrical power is sent through power conditioning equipment before it passes through a <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>unit</b> over {{an electrical}} bus to other spacecraft components. Batteries are typically connected to the bus via a battery charge regulator, and the batteries are used to provide electrical power during periods when primary power is not available, for example when a low Earth orbit spacecraft is eclipsed by Earth.|$|E

30|$|It {{is known}} that many grid codes have been {{released}} to regulate the power quality and integrate new energy systems within the distributed grid [21].
