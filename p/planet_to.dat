5|$|The European Southern Observatory (ESO) has {{confirmed}} {{the presence of}} a planet, Beta Pictoris b, matching previous predictions, through the use of direct imagery, orbiting in the plane of the debris disk surrounding the star. This planet is currently the closest extrasolar <b>planet</b> <b>to</b> its star ever photographed: the observed separation is roughly the same as the distance between Saturn and the Sun.|$|E
5|$|As {{the closest}} <b>planet</b> <b>to</b> Earth, Venus {{has been a}} prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It was the first planet beyond Earth visited by a {{spacecraft}} (Mariner 2 in 1962), {{and the first to}} be successfully landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970). Venus's thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible in visible light, and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions, but they are hindered by Venus's hostile surface conditions.|$|E

5|$|Epsilon Eridani is {{a target}} for planet finding {{programs}} because it has properties that allow an Earth-like <b>planet</b> <b>to</b> form. Although this system was not chosen as a primary candidate for the now-canceled Terrestrial Planet Finder, it was a target star for NASA's proposed Space Interferometry Mission to search for Earth-sized planets. The proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets of Epsilon Eridani have also made it the subject of multiple studies on whether an interstellar probe {{can be sent to}} Epsilon Eridani.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 c lies at {{the inner}} edge of the system's {{habitable}} zone. While the prospects for life on gas giants are unknown, {{it might be possible}} for a large moon of the <b>planet</b> <b>to</b> provide a habitable environment. Unfortunately tidal interactions between a hypothetical moon, the planet, and the star could destroy moons massive enough to be habitable over the lifetime of the system. In addition it is unclear whether such moons could form in the first place.|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 b is an {{extrasolar planet}} located {{approximately}} 210 light-years {{away in the}} constellation of Ara, orbiting the metal-rich and aged star HD 154672. This planet has a minimum mass five times that of Jupiter and orbits at about 60% {{the distance between the}} Earth to the Sun. Its orbit is very elliptical, which causes temperatures on the <b>planet</b> <b>to</b> vary significantly as it proceeds along its orbit. This planet was discovered in Las Campanas Observatory on September 5, 2008 using the radial velocity method (Doppler spectroscopy). Along with HD 205739 b, the planets were the first to be discovered by the N2K Consortium using the Magellan Telescopes.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-10c is an {{exoplanet}} {{orbiting the}} G-type star Kepler-10, located around 568 light-years away in Draco. Its discovery was announced by Kepler in May 2011, {{although it had}} {{been seen as a}} planetary candidate since January 2011, when Kepler-10b was discovered. The team confirmed the observation using data from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and a technique called Blender that ruled out most false positives. Kepler-10c was the third transiting <b>planet</b> <b>to</b> be confirmed statistically (based on probability rather than actual observation), after Kepler-9d and Kepler-11g. The Kepler team considers the statistical method that led to the discovery of Kepler-10c as what will be necessary to confirm many planets in Kepler's field of view.|$|E
5|$|Later {{observation}} by both SuperWASPs in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres led to {{the collection}} of 13,768 data points between January and May 2010 and {{to the use of}} the CORALIE spectrograph at La Silla Observatory in Chile. Fourteen measurements using the radial velocity method confirmed WASP-43b as a planet, revealing its mass in the process. The use of La Silla's TRAPPIST telescope helped the science team working on the <b>planet</b> <b>to</b> create a light curve of the planet's transit in December 2010.|$|E

50|$|In 2008, a <b>planet</b> was {{announced}} <b>to</b> be orbiting the star. The <b>planet</b> was found <b>to</b> {{have a minimum}} mass of 4.8 Jupiter masses and orbiting in a circular orbit that takes 186 days <b>to</b> complete. The <b>planet</b> {{is one of the}} few known <b>planets</b> <b>to</b> be orbiting an evolved intermediate-mass star and one of the innermost (such planets have only been discovered in clump giants).|$|R

5|$|Lord Kelvin used {{thermodynamics}} {{to estimate}} the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400 million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; {{it was only when}} radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the <b>planet</b> <b>to</b> be billions of years old. The perception of Earth shifted again in the 20th century when humans first viewed it from orbit, and especially with photographs of Earth returned by the Apollo program.|$|E
5|$|Mercury (0.4AU {{from the}} Sun) {{is the closest}} <b>planet</b> <b>to</b> the Sun and the {{smallest}} planet in the Solar System (0.055 Earth masses). Mercury has no natural satellites; besides impact craters, its only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history. Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind. Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle {{have not yet been}} adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact; or, that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.|$|E
5|$|On board Galactica, Admiral William Adama (Edward James Olmos) {{appoints}} their Cylon prisoner Sharon Agathon (Grace Park) a Colonial {{officer and}} sends {{her to the}} <b>planet</b> <b>to</b> liaise with the resistance.

Simultaneously, the 200 human prisoners are being transported to a location by the Cylons and NCP. A masked Jammer, realizing {{they are to be}} executed, saves Cally by releasing her in secret and telling her to run. As she runs away, the sound of gunfire is heard.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Radio {{astronomy}} {{observations of}} close approaches of the Solar system <b>planets</b> <b>to</b> compact radio sources {{as well as}} radio source occultations by planets may be of large interest for planetary scienc-es, dynamical astronomy, and testing gravity theories. In this paper, we present extended lists of occulta-tions of astrometric radio sources observed {{in the framework of}} various astrometric and geodetic VLBI programs by planets, and close approaches of <b>planets</b> <b>to</b> radio sources expected in the nearest years. Computations are made making use of the EPOS software package...|$|R

5|$|Radial {{velocity}} measurements {{revealed the}} existence of a planet with a mass of at least 7 Earths. This planet, GJ 3634 b, became the first <b>planet</b> <b>to</b> be discovered under the new strategy. The team of astronomers then followed up with transit measurements using instruments on the Spitzer Space Telescope; they found that there was most likely no transit event present at the star, but they were able to discover its true mass. GJ 3634 b was published to the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics on February 8, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Spock's father, Sarek (Mark Lenard), confronts Kirk {{about his}} son's death. The pair learn that before he died, Spock {{transferred}} his katra, or living spirit, to McCoy. Spock's katra and body {{are needed to}} lay him to rest on his homeworld, Vulcan, and without help, McCoy will die from carrying the katra. Disobeying orders, Kirk and his officers spring McCoy from detention, disable the USS Excelsior, and steal the Enterprise from Spacedock {{to return to the}} Genesis <b>planet</b> <b>to</b> retrieve Spock's body.|$|E
5|$|The Earth {{formed from}} the same cloud of matter that formed the Sun, but the planets {{acquired}} different compositions during the formation and evolution of the solar system. In turn, {{the natural history of}} the Earth caused parts of this <b>planet</b> <b>to</b> have differing concentrations of the elements. The mass of the Earth is approximately 5.98kg. It is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to planetary differentiation, the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.|$|E
