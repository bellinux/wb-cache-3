5|$|While the {{individual}} diver cannot predict exactly at what depth {{the onset of}} narcosis will occur on a given day, the first symptoms of narcosis for any given diver are often more predictable and personal. For example, one diver may have trouble with eye focus (close accommodation for middle-aged divers), another may experience feelings of euphoria, and another feelings of claustrophobia. Some divers report that they have hearing changes, and that the sound their exhaled bubbles make becomes different. Specialist training may help divers to identify these personal onset signs, which may then {{be used as a}} signal to ascend to avoid the narcosis, although severe narcosis may interfere with the judgement necessary to take <b>preventive</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E

25|$|A static {{discharge}} {{in the presence}} of air or oxygen can create ozone. Ozone can degrade rubber parts. Many elastomers are sensitive to ozone cracking. Exposure to ozone creates deep penetrative cracks in critical components like gaskets and O-rings. Fuel lines are also susceptible to the problem unless <b>preventive</b> <b>action</b> is taken. Preventive measures include adding anti-ozonants to the rubber mix, or using an ozone-resistant elastomer. Fires from cracked fuel lines have been a problem on vehicles, especially in the engine compartments where ozone can be produced by electrical equipment.|$|E

The same year, the CCD Working Group published a comprehensive descriptive study that concluded: [...] "Of the 61 variables quantified (including adult bee physiology, pathogen loads, and pesticide levels), no single factor was found with enough consistency to suggest one causal agent. Bees in CCD colonies had higher pathogen loads and were co-infected with more pathogens than control populations, suggesting either greater pathogen exposure or reduced defenses in CCD bees." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{process of}} the effect of HIV/AIDS can be {{described}} as having three key stages: first, the effect experienced at the micro level; second, at the sectoral level; and finally, at the macro level.

Individuals and families have been bearing both the economic and social costs of the disease, and the poverty of those affected have increased and will further increase substantially. Expenditures for the health sector will increase, for both treatment and prevention interventions. The macro level has been mostly unaffected [...] But if without effective <b>preventive</b> <b>action,</b> the HIV spread in the general population at large will affect the macro level as have happened in some countries in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E

2500|$|Kekkonen kept KGB connections, {{especially}} its local Helsinki chief, close and utilized back channels to balance between Western and Soviet interests without provocation, such {{as during the}} negotiations on Finland's membership to the European Free Trade Association in 1962. Similarly, he shifted Supo's counter-intelligence activities to quiet and <b>preventive</b> <b>action.</b> For example, espionage cases were sometimes not submitted to court and KGB diplomats were not declared persona non grata, but instead were quietly asked to leave. When KGB major Anatoliy Golitsyn defected to the United States from Helsinki in December 1961, he divulged his knowledge and opinions on KGB networks and interaction in Finland to the CIA. For example, he described President Kekkonen as being [...] "in Soviet service"—Kekkonen was relieved when the CIA and Western intelligence took the claim with reservations. Nevertheless, the revelations prompted Western intelligence {{to have a more}} constructive and positive attitude towards Finland and the CIA shared Golitsyn's list of KGB intelligence officers to Supo for monitoring.|$|E

Black had resigned from government service in 2004 and entered the private sector before the controversial renditions occurred. Black's legacy is that he created and led the team that successfully counter-attacked Al-Qaeda and the Taliban immediately after 9/11, while concurrently leading the successful implementation of the presidentially approved [...] "Worldwide Attack Matrix," [...] in which the CIA engaged all known Al Qaeda operatives and supporters on a global basis. This full court press may have stopped Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda from implementing any follow-up attacks on the United States if any such attacks had been planned. [...] In addition, Black can be credited with having provided clear early warnings to the president's top advisors on July 10, 2001—two months before 9/11—that a major terrorist attack was imminent, and with having urged that immediate <b>preventive</b> <b>action</b> be taken.|$|E

40|$|Part-I of this two-part paper {{develops}} {{an optimal}} algorithm for transient stability control to coordinate <b>preventive</b> <b>actions</b> and emergency actions for {{a subset of}} contingencies with the same unstable mode. In this part, the cases of several subsets of contingencies with different unstable modes are dealt with. Some <b>preventive</b> <b>actions</b> benefiting a subset of contingencies may go against the stability of others; thus coordination among the optimal schemes for individual subsets is necessary. The coordination is achieved by properly replacing <b>preventive</b> <b>actions</b> with emergency actions for some individual subsets. It is formulated as a classical model of economic dispatch with additional generating costs due to the emergency actions. Such an optimal algorithm is proposed based on the algorithm in the Part-I and verified by simulations on a Chinese power system. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Background. The {{objective}} was to describe the extent of passive smoking exposure and <b>preventive</b> <b>actions</b> against passive smoking in non-smoking pregnant women and to analyze factors associated with <b>preventive</b> <b>actions.</b> Methods. This was a cross-sectional survey on 1449 never-smoking pregnant women who made their first prenatal visit to the Women and Children's Hospital of Guangzhou, China during 1996 - 97. Results. 60. 2 % (95 % Confidence Interval 57. 7 %- 62. 7 %) of the never-smoking pregnant women had a husband who currently smoked. Women with smoking husbands (n= 872) were more exposed to ETS than those with non-smoking husbands (n= 577) at home (71 % vs. 33 %), in public places (77 % vs. 66 %) and at work (60 % vs. 50 % of working women), and they took less actions against passive smoking in public places. Women with better education and knowledge on smoking and passive smoking had stronger <b>preventive</b> <b>actions.</b> Conclusions. Non-smoking pregnant women in China are often exposed to passive smoking and their <b>preventive</b> <b>actions</b> are weak. Passive smoking is an important obstetric and public health problem in developing countries and deserves urgent international attention. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
