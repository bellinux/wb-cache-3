50|$|The {{age of the}} Navajo Sandstone is {{somewhat}} controversial. It may originate from the Late Triassic but {{is at least as}} young as the Early Jurassic stages Pliensbachian and Toarcian. There is no type locality of the name. It was simply named for the 'Navajo Country' of the southwestern United States. The two major subunits of the Navajo are the Lamb <b>Point</b> <b>Tongue</b> (Kanab area) and the Shurtz Sandstone Tongue (Cedar City area).|$|E
50|$|There is no {{designated}} type locality {{for this}} group. It was named by Gregory and Moore in 1931 for exposures in walls {{that form the}} Glen Canyon of the Colorado River in Coconino County, Arizona and San Juan County, Utah. An overview of the group was given three years before by Gilluly and Reeside. Baker revised the work and named the Kayenta Formation in 1936. The work was revised again 1955 by Averitt and others. They assigned the Shurtz Sandstone Tongue (new) and Lamb <b>Point</b> <b>Tongue</b> (new) to the Navajo Sandstone, and Cedar City Tongue (new) and Tenney Canyon Tongue (new) to the Kayenta Formation. In 1957 Harshbarger and others created an overview and revision that assigned the Moenave Formation and divided the Wingate Sandstone into newly the named Rock Point and Lukachukai members. The group's age was modified by Lewis and others in 1961 and the upper contact was revised by Phoenix in 1963. Poole and Stewart attempted to reduce the group's rank to a formation they called the Glen Canyon Sandstone in 1964 (change not recognized by the USGS). Areal extent limits were revised by Wilson and Stewart in 1967 and again by Green in 1974. Peterson and Pipiringos revised the upper contact and created an overview in 1979. In 1989 {{the age of the}} group was modified by Padian and separately by Dubiel (who also revised the lower contact). Condon modified the areal extent limits in 1992.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Presentation date: 1975 - 10 - 13 Eight Tertiary {{geologic}} units crop {{out in the}} Seaside-Young's River Falls area, including late Oligocene {{to early}} Miocene Oswald West mudstones; Angora Peak sandstone and Silver Point members of the middle Miocene Astoria Formation, and middle Miocene Depoe Bay and Cape Foulweather Basalts. Three new lithologically distinct units, the 'J' and Airplane units of the Astoria Formation and the middle Miocene Dump sandstones, are described and named informally. The Silver Point is subdivided into lower and upper tongues. These units are locally overlain by Quaternary beach ridges (Clatsop Plains) and two alluvial terraces. The 250 -meter thick Oswald West mudstones are poorly stratified, yellowish orange tuffaceous burrowed mudstones. The {{upper part of the}} unit contains glauconitic sandstones, local fine -grained, well-bedded arkosic sandstones, and tuff beds. The unit was deposited in an open, deep-marine (outer shelf to upper slope) environment. Broad uplift following deposition of the Oswald West formed a minor angular unconformity with the overlying Astoria Formation. The Angora Peak sandstones are composed of over 120 meters of fossiliferous arkosic wackes and arenites deposited in a high energy, wave-dominated beach or bar environment. Gradual transgression is indicated by the gradation of pebbly coarse-grained sandstones upward into deeper marine clay-rich bioturbated fine-grained sandstones. The lower Silver <b>Point</b> <b>tongue</b> is a 'flysch- 1 ike" sequence of interbedded very fine-grained arkosic wackes an gray mudstones. It was deposited in a sublittoral environment by both turbidity and tidal currents on a delta slope or outer delta platform. The 'J' unit, which conformably overlies the lower Silver <b>Point</b> <b>tongue,</b> consists of approximately 150 meters of well-laminated micaceous, carbonaceous mudstones of lagoonal origin. A sequence of arkosic, coarse-grained pebbly delta distributary channel sandstones of the 'J' unit gradually prograded westward into the lagoonal environment. Rapid subsidence, perhaps by abandonment of the 'J' deltaic lobe, resulted in transgression over the study area. Over 250 meters of well-laminated yellowish brown mudstones of the Airplane tongue were deposited in an upper slope or outer shelf environment as suggested by an abundant foraminiferal assemblage. The Airplane mudstones grade into the overlying upper Silver <b>Point</b> <b>tongue</b> which is composed of approximately 120 meters of very thin interbedded dark gray mudstones and very fine-grained micaceous sandstones and siltstones. The upper Silver <b>Point</b> <b>tongue</b> was deposited at bathyal depths, possible in a low-energy pro-delta slope environment. Broad, open folding and extensive erosion occurred soon after deposition of the upper Silver Point The 50 -meter thick Dump sandstones overlie several members of the Astoria Formation in apparent angular unconformity. These clay-rich very fine-grained arkosic sheet sandstones and siltstones possibly formed from erosion and redeposition of older sedimentary units. Numerous dikes, irregular sills, peperites, and submarine pillow lavas of the Depoe Bay Basalt and younger sparsely porphyritic Cape Foulweather Basalt intrude or overlie all Tertiary sedimentary units. These tholeiitic basalts are locally 150 meters thick, but pinch out within several kilometers, possibly due to lava ponding on an irregular ocean floor and/or accumulation around local volcanic centers. Sedimentary interbeds between flows suggest intermittent volcanic activity. Folding and faulting of these Oligocene and Miocene units probably coincides with uplift of the present Coast Range which resulted from convergence of the Juan de Fuca and North American plates during late Miocene time. This deformation formed northwest trending folds and two major sets of high angle faults striking northwest and northeast. The Angora Peak sandstones are potential hydrocarbon reservoirs in the nearby continental shelf. Well logs and cores from three nearby wells suggest that Eocene and Oligocene sedimentary units are too impermeable for significant hydrocarbon production...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Six {{early to}} middle Tertiary {{geologic}} units crop {{out in the}} Saddle and Humbug Mountain area. They include the late Eocene to early Miocene Oswald West muds tones, the lower Silver Point and the upper Silver Point tongues of the middle Miocene Astoria Formation, and the middle Miocene Depoe Bay and Cape Foulweather Basalts. One new lithologically distinct unit, the Falls Creek member of the Oswald West muds tones, is mapped, described, and named informally herein. These Tertiary units are locally overlain by Quaternary stream alluvium and landslide deposits. The Oswald West mudstones consist of more than 500 meters of thickly bedded grayish to yellowish orange bioturbated tuffaceous siltstones and mudstones interstratified with minor glauconitic sandstones and tuff beds. An open-marine, deep-water, slightly reducing depositional environment (outer shelf-continental slope) is indicated by Foraminifera, trace fossils, glauconite, and the predominantly fine-grained character of the unit. Deposition of the Falls Creek silts tone member which contains a very shallow water molluscan fossil assemblage probably occurred during gradual shallowing {{near the end of}} the late Oligocene, possibly due to adjacent deltaic progradation. An angular unconformity separates the Oswald West muds tones from the overlying lower Silver <b>Point</b> <b>tongue</b> and suggests that a broad uplift occurred during an early Miocene hiatus. Thin feldspathic sandstone lenses occur locally above the unconformity and mark the beginning of a middle Miocene marine transgression during lower Silver Point time. The approximately 300 -meter thick Silver Point member is composed of two intertonguing lithosomes. The lower tongue consists of rhythmically bedded, light gray, laminated, micaceous and carbonaceous sandstones and dark gray siltstones. Graded bedding and partial Bouma sequences suggest that these sandstones were deposited by turbidity currents, possibly on a delta slope or outer delta platform. Paleocurrent measurements and facies patterns indicate that these turbidity flows originated at a south to southeasterly source, probably by slumping off the nearby Angora Peak delta front. Thick-bedded, structureless, arkosic sandstones which locally interfinger with the basal part of the lower Silver <b>Point</b> <b>tongue</b> probably also reflect redeposition of "clean" delta front sheet sands into deeper water delta slope environments. The lower Silver <b>Point</b> <b>tongue</b> grades upward into the 200 -meter thick upper Silver <b>Point</b> <b>tongue</b> which consists of dark gray structureless to finely laminated mudstones and rare thin sandstone beds. Foraminifera and the overall fine-grained lithology indicate that this unit was deposited under deep marine (upper bathyal), low energy conditions and reflects continuing marine transgression over the region. Postulated underthrusting caused by convergence of the Juan de Fuca oceanic plate and the North American continental plate along the middle Miocene Oregon continental margin (Ku lm and Fowler, 1974 a, 1974 b), may have caused the uplift and high-angle faulting and development of an unconformity which followed upper Silver Point marine deposition. Rapid subsidence and marine transgression ended this short-lived erosion period as evidenced by the local eruption of over 600 meters of palagonitized Depoe Bay submarine basaltic breccias and pillow lavas and more than 200 meters of sparsely porphyritic Cape Foulweather submarine pillow lavas. The Depoe Bay Basalt lies with angular unconformity over the faulted Silver Point member and Oswald West mudstones. A local basaltic conglomerate interbed within the Depoe Bay breccias (near the base) suggests that some early Depoe Bay volcanic buildups developed above wave base. Chemical analyses show that these basalts are tholeiites and are comparable to the type Cape Foulweather and Depoe Bay petrologic-types along the central Oregon Coast. All Tertiary sedimentary units are intruded by numerous dikes, sills, and irregular-shaped plutons. Regional dike swarms and local feeder dikes to Depoe Bay Basalt eruptive centers such as Saddle Mountain, commonly, either parallel or coincide with northeasttrending or northwest-trending lineaments and high-angle faults, suggesting a structural control for the emplacement of the intrusives and location of the volcanic centers. The largest fault in the study area (Humbug Mountain fault) is co-linear with the northwest-trending Gales Creek Fault and another unnamed fault southeast of the study area. In total, these three faults form an almost continuous line of faults across the northern Oregon Coast Range for a distance of 100 km...|$|E
40|$|In TCM, the {{diagnostic}} process consists of inspection, auscultation and olfaction, inquiry and palpation. Part of this diagnostic {{process is the}} study of the tongue. After careful consideration of all diagnostic information, the treatment points are chosen. During a research project on TCM treatment (weekly treatment for 12 weeks) in patients with chronic schizophrenia, tongue pictures were used in order to monitor treatment progress according to TCM principles. After pre-testing, 12 weeks of treatment, and post-testing; patients were shown their own results on the pre- and post-tests, as well as their own 12 tongue pictures. At that <b>point,</b> <b>tongue</b> pictures {{turned out to be a}} great motivation for patients to evaluate their own treatment, to see with their own eyes what changes were, or were not, reached. Moreover, patients concluded that they can personally take an influence in their condition and life, for instance by changing their lifestyles. Many patients reported that, in contrast to their usual antipsychotic medicinal treatment which is evaluated by their psychiatrist and other caretakers, they could really relate to this method of diagnosis and they indicated the willingness to watch their own tongues and work with that. In a group of patients in which treatment compliance is always an issue, this is an important finding. Since all patients in this study suffered from schizophrenia, but not all patients suffered from the same TCM diagnosis, a comparison was made between the patients, according to their tongue diagnosis and tongue pictures in order to come to several subgroups within TCM that might be treated by similar methods. The differentiation of patterns will be presented along with ideas for future research and treatment in this group of chronic patients...|$|E
