40|$|The only {{large-scale}} cost-effective way {{to exhaust}} contaminated {{air from the}} furnace <b>pot</b> <b>room</b> of an industrial plant is through natural ventilation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} possible neurotoxic {{effects in}} groups of aluminium <b>pot</b> <b>room</b> and foundry workers, aluminium welders, and {{a small group of}} workers exposed to aluminium in the production of flake powder.  METHODS—Exposure to aluminium was evaluated with aluminium concentrations in blood and urine as well as a questionnaire. The groups exposed to aluminium were compared with a group of mild steel welders. Neurotoxic effects were studied with mood and symptom questionnaires and several psychological and neurophysiological tests.  RESULTS—The <b>pot</b> <b>room</b> and foundry workers showed very low aluminium uptake as their aluminium concentrations in blood and urine were close to normal, and no effects on the nervous system were detected. The group of workers exposed to flake powder had high concentrations of aluminium in blood and urine, even higher than those of the aluminium welders. However, aluminium could not be shown to affect the functioning of the nervous system in flake powder producers. Although significant effects could not be shown in the present analysis of the data on welders, the performance of the welders exposed to high concentrations of aluminium was affected according to the analyses in the original paper from this group.  CONCLUSIONS—For the <b>pot</b> <b>room</b> and foundry workers no effects related to the exposure to aluminium could be found. For the group of flake powder producers exposed for a short term no effects on the nervous systems were evident despite high levels of exposure. Due to the high concentrations of aluminium in the biological samples of this group, measures to reduce the exposure to aluminium are recommended, as effects on the central nervous system might develop after protracted exposures. However, this assumption needs to be verified in further studies.    Keywords: aluminium; workers; nervous syste...|$|E

40|$|Health hazards {{arise in}} large {{industrial}} workshops (such as aluminium pot rooms) {{due to the}} production of heat by the process equipment inside these workshops, which leads to high temperatures around these pieces of equipment. The heat production is sometimes accompanied by the release of polluting gases and dust particles that are dispersed throughout the workshop. The only large-scale and cost-effective way to ventilate these workshops is through natural ventilation. The effectiveness of the ventilation depends on the architectural shape of the building, the heat source locations and the openings of the windows, louvers and/or roof ventilators through which the air is allowed to enter and exit. This paper describes the investigation into the feasibility of using mathematical optimisation to determine the ideal window slat angles for different prevailing wind conditions.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{comprehensive}} list of asthmagens which may occur in occupational settings in Australia. Methods: Potential asthmagens considered for this list were identified through work {{health and safety}} classification databases in Australia and through lists developed by professional associations in other countries. Inclusion criteria were: {{there is evidence that}} the agent is asthmagenic; it is used in occupational settings; and it is available in Australia. Results: The final list contained 277 asthmagens in 27 groups that may be found in occupational circumstances in Australia. Three other agents that have been documented as asthmagens in Australia were included: almond dust, fluoride (in aluminium <b>pot</b> <b>room</b> fumes); and sawdust from the Australian Blackwood. Conclusions: This is the first comprehensive and inclusive list of Australian occupationally relevant asthmagens to have been compiled. Implications: This list is specific for Australian workplace exposure to asthmagens. It will help focus policy and preventative practices and reduce the burden of occupational asthma. It will also be useful in future studies to identify those who are exposed to the asthmagens and provide information to assist regulators to identify industries, occupations, specific activities and existing exposure standards that can be targeted to improve worker health and welfare...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the development, evaluation and modelling of an anti-segregation system ("AS-System") for. use in larger silos handling alumina in the aluminium smelting industry. This work is unlike {{much of what}} has gone before because {{it is much more}} grounded in the technical and economic consequences of segregation for a particular manufacturing process. Segregation of particulates, i. e. separation of components due to differences in properties such as size, density etc., has an extensive literature going back as far as 1915, but this focuses mainly on the segregation process itself and largely ignores the context and the consequences. The consequence of segregation is loss of homogeneity; the impact that has on any given process, is generally not addressed very deeply. Surveying the literature on segregation, and studying the total processes of aluminium production, creates a basis for understanding the importance of segregation for aluminium production, as well as the importance of powder technology in general for this industry. A method for quantification of segregation in this production process, based on sampling, has been established. This was intended to give the fundamental information necessary for measuring the extent of the problem and the degree of improvement achieved. By placing sampling points along the logistic chain for the alumina, and by sampling these points for a long enough period, information about the influence of the various handling steps on the bulk solids can be identified. Segregation by particle size is the main type of influence, although the work has shown that attrition is another. Standardised statistical expressions have been used for analysing the bottlenecks of the logistic loops, and study of the results has led to a useful way of expressing the level of segregation, the change of segregation level in a handling step (silo filling and discharge), and improvements in this change. The degree of segregation when handling alumina has proven to be quite considerable in terms of effects on the production process. The effects on the efficiency of the aluminium smelting process, and the environment, have both been evaluated. Variations in the alumina due to segregation have been found to correlate with both dust concentration in the smelter <b>pot</b> <b>room,</b> and anode effects (an unwanted upset in the smelting process). An economical evaluation of an investment in anti segregation systems has been made. This evaluation has shown significant economic consequences, clearly justifying both the investigations of segregation, and the implementation of anti segregation measures. To remedy the effects of air current segregation in the aluminium industry, a complete Anti Segregation System (AS-System) based around Anti Segregation Tubes (AST) utilising a special inlet configuration has been developed. In a number of full size installations, this solution has proved itself capable of handling the variations and transients of process conditions which occur in the industry, with a large operational capacity range, due to the special inlet configuration. The effect of the full scale installed anti segregation systems have been measured, and compared to other systems. The AS-System clearly demonstrated a homogenising effect no matter how low the ingoing variations in particle size were. Other commercial systems which have been evaluated {{have turned out to be}} no more than Segregation Effect Damping Systems, since they only seem to reduce the segregation effect after it has happened, instead of trying to eliminate the problem by directly attacking the segregation mechanism itself which is what the AS-System does. A new scaled down test rig for the AS-System was developed, consisting of three ASTs fed from a central distributor. To test the potential effect of the AS-System, to determine its efficiency in countering segregation, tests with repeated filling and emptying of a scale silo were carried out. The results clearly showed that the AS-System very much reduced segregation, compared to conventional filling, even in a small-scale silo. Improved models have been developed for the function of the AST and these have been verified against measurements from the new test rig. The early version of the test rig for the AST used only one centre-mounted tube, with one pressure measurement in the top of the tube. The first models were based on the assumption of the pressure being linear, and assumed full dispersion of the falling material inside the tube; and calibrated from the single pressure measurement inside at the top of the tube. Although this simple model calculated very conservative values of the negative pressure, the model was used for the initial development and design of the AST, and later the ASSystem (Anti Segregation System). A second model was derived, where the material velocity was calculated based on free fall. This model was also based on the idea of full dispersion, but was in better agreement with measured values during further tests, which showed a considerable deviation from the original assumption of a linear pressure distribution once intermediate pressure measurements were available. When using the multi-phase-flow-simulation-program-code FLUENT to simulate the pressure distribution of the AST, the results were quite disappointing, however the FLUENT program was able to identify an initial positive pressure generated by the flow from the inlet box to the tube. Implementing this initial pressure into the simple non-linear model above, both the trend and values correspond quite well with the measured values. A single particle drag model was tried, but dismissed after calculating the maximum possible capacity for known tubes and finding the predictions to be unrealistically low. A new approach was introduced, modelling the fall of the powder in a continuous layer along the inner wall of the tube on one side, creating skin drag along the surface between the falling solid powder and the air. The length of the tube and the width of the chosen AST profile define this surface. This approach assumes that the powder falls like a layer along the tube wall. Previous theory for pressure drop in pneumatic conveying inspired this approach, but it had not previously been used for gravity flow in vertical tubes, and as a result the novel Solid Surface Body Drag Model (SSBDM) was developed. This analytical model gives very good correspondence with the measured data for the pressure distribution inside the AST, yet is extremely simple to use. When comparing the model with measured data, the SSBDM was able to predict the pressure distribution within the error boundaries of the test measurements. A method for design of the AST was derived from the SSBDM, using a dimensionless parameter function determined for the pressure drop model. The models giving the design indicate that the capacity is more than proportional to the cross sectional area of a chosen tube profile, which is in agreement with observations. The model suggests that the capacity is proportional to the cross sectional area in the power of 1. 25. This model allowed the study of the effect of tube shape, which revealed that a square profile for the AST does not seem to be the optimum design; rather, a rectangular profile should be chosen for maximum capacity. The model suggests that the capacity is proportional to the width of the side of the tube along which the powder layer is falling, but proportional to the perpendicular side in a rectangular profile in the power of 1. 5. The model gives an equation for pressure drop which can also be utilised to place the first valve on the tube. It also shows that for high capacities, and large silos, a system consisting of several ASTs should be chosen (AS-System). Predictions from the model have been tested against the measured capacities of full scale installed systems and give good agreement. Overall, the AS-System has been shown to be cost-effective in reducing segregation; results measured from the full scale installations show a homogenising factor (reduction in variation of the material being handled) of 1 - 1. 5. As a result of these verifications and the simplicity of the model presented in this thesis, the plant engineer can confidently design a system which will function correctly and make a positive, predictable improvement in the homogeneity of the alumina in his plant...|$|E

While Gray was working at Myall Park the infrastructure to support {{the functions of the}} garden were improved. Drawing on his prior experience, Gray designed suitable nursery structures. According to Gordon, he built for Gray the types of structures that the Victorian Government would not supply for him at Wail in Victoria. The nursery consisted of a single-storey timber building with a <b>potting</b> <b>room</b> and a seed storage room, connected by a covered entry to a timber-framed glasshouse/misting room with a concrete slab floor. The timber building was constructed first and the glasshouse was a later addition. A yard {{to the rear of the}} buildings housed four large timber hardening bays. The nursery was built by Harry Howe, with the assistance of cabinetmaker Bill Dunmall, who fitted out the vermin proof seed storage room with silky oak cabinet drawers. Cypress pine milled on the property was used in the construction of the buildings. A catalogue system was used to record seed source and date, supplier and usage. Details of propagations, planting locations and survival rates were all recorded. Around this time a large single room, lined with tall cupboards and work benches was constructed at the Gordon family residence house, to provide an art space for Dorothy and to store herbarium specimens. The house is now located within the Myall Park pastoral property, just outside the Botanic Garden boundary. The herbarium specimens formerly located in the house are now held by the Myall Park Botanic Garden.|$|R

50|$|When first built, {{the ground}} floor of Government House held a suite of {{interconnected}} rooms that, opened to one another, formed a suite 29 m long and 6.1 m wide. Altogether, these included, in a counter-clockwise array around the central stair hall, the library, immediately {{to the right of the}} foyer, the breakfast room, the drawing room, the dining room, a serving room, and the viceroy's office at the left of the foyer. Later, in 1901, a veranda was built around the north-east corner of the house, and a ballroom was added to the rear, both at the personal expense of Lieutenant Governor Daniel Hunter McMillan. Then, in 1908, the front porch was enclosed in a robust structure and a palm room and adjoining conservatory were added off the dining room. Until 1946, the kitchens were in the basement and serving took place via a dumbwaiter; that year a new kitchen was built into another extension off the rear of the mansion. Eventually what had been the palm room was made into an extension of the dining room and, in 1953, the original serving room was sacrificed in favour of a cloak room and powder room, as well as an elevator in place of the dumbwaiter. The ballroom was demolished in 1960 to make way for the current assembly room, which was, for catering purposes, linked to the kitchen by a new serving room, and three years following, the conservatory was pulled down and replaced with a new sun <b>room,</b> <b>potting</b> <b>room,</b> and greenhouse, as well as a three car garage.

40|$|Carbon anodes are {{essential}} when producing aluminium. Oxygen from dissolved aluminium oxide reacts electrochemically on the carbon anode forming CO 2. The carbon anode is consumed during the process. The production of aluminium happens {{according to the}} electrochemical reaction: 2 Al 2 O 3 (diss) + 3 C (s) = 4 Al (l) + 3 CO 2 (g) Carbon anodes are produced from calcined petroleum coke and a pitch binder. Anisotropic sponge coke was traditionally used as anode grade coke; however, the increased production of aluminium {{in the world has}} led to an increase in the demand for anode grade coke. Isotropic coke that was previously graded as fuel grade coke is being tested as anode grade coke in blends by some smelters around the world. In this work a series of pilot anodes have been made where the effect of blending isotropic coke into anisotropic coke was investigated. The pilot anodes were investigated both through characterisation techniques and electrochemical performance. Isotropic coke is higher in impurities (especially metals like vanadium and nickel, and sulfur) than many anisotropic sponge cokes and the increased impurity level can impose problems in the <b>pot</b> <b>rooms.</b> Also, the coefficient of thermal expansion between the two cokes is very different and this will cause increased cracking of anodes containing a certain level of isotropic coke. Cracking was observed in pilot anodes containing 35. 0 wt% and 49. 0 wt% isotropic coke. However, electrochemical testing showed that the introduction of isotropic coke to the pilot anodes proved positive in reducing the anodic reaction overpotential and also reducing the voltage oscillations caused by gas bubbles. Reducing the reaction overpotential can give a reduction in the energy consumption of the overall process, and reduction in voltage oscillations during bubble build-up and release will give more stable pots. It was also found that the wettability between the anode and the electrolyte was improved when isotropic coke was present. It is reasonable to assume a correlation between the reduction in voltage oscillations and improved wettability between anode and electrolyte. The effect of the production parameters mixing temperature between pitch and coke, and baking temperature was also investigated in pilot anodes. A pilot anode line was prepared where the mixing and baking temperatures were varied: a high and a low mixing temperature and a medium and a low baking temperature. The electrochemical effect of varying these anode production parameters was small. However, the mixing temperature proved very important in order to produce homogeneous and dense anodes where the pitch had penetrated the coke well...|$|R

50|$|The {{architecture}} externally of the Gaol {{could be}} described as typical 19th century prison architecture, the principal facade facing onto the Bierton Road, {{the only part of the}} prison visible to the public has classical pretensions. Built of red brick with dressed stone quoining the focal point is the large central bay containing the arched entrance. The bay has an entablature but no pediments. The frieze bears the date 1845 in Roman numerals. The central bay is flanked by two short wings containing administrative offices leading to two large cubed blocks which were the residences of the governor and his deputy. An unexplainable architectural mystery here is that the short flanking wings are dwarfed by massive chimneys containing far more chimney <b>pots</b> than the <b>rooms</b> within could possibly require. Behind this severe public face of the prison, all attempts at attractive architecture ceased. Tall red brick cell blocks several stories high under a slate roof surrounded the central courtyard. The architecture was utilitarian in the extreme. The building still stands, the main facade largely unchanged. It remains a prison.|$|R

60|$|Osgod was overtaken, plodding {{steadily}} {{along the}} road, fifteen miles from town. Leof took {{him up on}} his horse, and they reached Guildford just {{as the sun was}} setting. The inn, which stood in the principal street of the town, was a low building built with a massive framework filled in with bricks. The ground-floor was occupied by a single room. At one end was the great fireplace where, over a pile of blazing logs, were hung many cauldrons and <b>pots.</b> Round the <b>room</b> ran a raised bench some six feet wide on which the guests disposed themselves for sleep at night; rough tables and benches occupied the rest of the room. Some twenty or thirty travellers were seated at these. Few were eating, but the greater portion had horns of beer or mead before them. As Wulf and his companions entered, after giving over their horses to one of the helpers, the host, seeing by his attire that he was of condition above the ordinary, came forward and led him {{to the end of the}} room nearest the fire, where the floor was raised a foot and a half above the general level, forming a sort of dais where travellers of distinction could take their meals apart from the rest of the guests. Leof was now spokesman.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the evaluation, modification and modelling {{of a mass}} flow feeding silo, stand pipe and standard air slide system for use in handling and transporting alumina in the aluminium smelting industry. Stability and repeatability of gravitational flow rates from feeding silos and stand pipes (addressed as interfaces) is crucial from operational {{point of view and}} needs to be achieved before one can further estimate and model the flow of alumina and the capacity of an air slide. Although techniques for design of storage vessels (based on the flow characteristics of particulates) have been in the public domain since the 1960 ’s, they have been slow to gain acceptance in the industry (due to a lack of awareness of their existence amongst engineers). The use of the stand pipe concept to increase flow rates during gravity discharge and to achieve stability of flow has been examined experimentally in a small rig at Tel-Tek department of POSTEC. The stand pipe should be integrated into the mechanical design of an air slide, because if the material cannot be delivered (discharged) properly from the feeding unit onto the air slide, there will be no stable conveying conditions. It has been found by Gu, Arnold and McLean (1993) that the stand pipe is efficient only if it is kept full of powder - the feeding silo acting more as a buffer for the stand pipe. Their concept was implemented in practice during the tests conducted at POSTEC by monitoring the weight of material in the stand pipe and the flow rates of alumina in real time by using LabView software and weighing cells. What makes the research work reported in this document unique is the integration of different mechanical and modelling concepts from different engineering fields (continuum and soil mechanics, fluid dynamics, rheology, cybernetics and powder technology). Previous work undertaken by Haugland (1998) for Hydro focused the flow of alumina as a Newtonian fluid and was itself based on the modelling work of Woodcock (1978). Yet, besides their work, no accurate mathematical model has been developed which could be used to predict the velocity and mass flow rates of alumina flow and capacity of an air slide for a range of alumina qualities. Such a model would be extremely useful when designing new air slide systems, as the capacity of air slides could be predicted from the rheology of powder and the knowledge of bulk particulate characteristics. Previous research, measurement campaigns and extensive literature studies, all point out that in terms of controlling discharge from gravity flow equipment (and after studying the transport behaviour of an air slide), it is often the gravity discharge approach that generates the greatest degree of variability, in terms of both consistency and repeatability. The root of the problem of inconsistent discharge rates has been identified to lie with the flow channel development within the feeding silo and/or the stand pipe (discharge head). The potential causes of flow irregularities are even more critical to be aware of, in the cases where mass flow principles are intended to be applied - {{especially in the case of}} highly segregable materials like alumina blends. This thesis is aimed at developing a reliable means for predicting the average velocity of alumina flow and capacity and also to understand the mechanisms that govern the flow behaviour. To enable online estimation and further modelling of full-scale air slide capacity, a small-scale rig with adjustable length was built at POSTEC in 2012 and further modified in 2013. Air slide capacity (alumina flow rates) for different lengths of 3 m, 7 m and 15 m and inclination angles from 0 to 3. 1 degrees of air slide were measured by using pressurized air in the range of 3 to 6. 5 barg. Empirical models have been developed from test results as a first step. It was found based on empirical models that the velocity of alumina bed has a power law behaviour. However, these models would require the use of expensive and time-consuming air slide trials to determine the values of the power law coefficients for each alumina quality. The degree of segregation when handling and transporting alumina has proven to be quite considerable, in terms of undesirable effects on the production process. This thesis was prompted by several measurement programmes of work undertaken for Hydro by the author with the aim of mapping the performance of volumetric feeders and the degree of segregation in a feeding air slide rig at The Reference Centre in Årdal. Sampling from feeders and chemical analysis of the samples have clearly shown the degree of segregation, especially when fluidizing and transporting binary mixtures of alumina and aluminium fluoride. Pressure measurement results showed pressure drops along the air supply tube, which also have been found to have an impact on segregation. Fluidization and shearing trials have been conducted both on alumina and binary mixtures in order to establish a benchmark procedure for powder characterisation that could be used as an operational support tool. Currently the minimum fluidization velocity for all Hydro Aluminium plants is set to 2. 0 cm/s, which is much higher than what it is actually needed to achieve an optimal fluidization. There is a strong analogy with the flow of Newtonian or non – Newtonian fluids in an open channel that can be applied to the flow of fluidized alumina on an air slide. In this thesis, the hydrological non- Newtonian model developed from the general Saint-Venant model of open channel in a rectangular channel has been applied as a second step. Such theoretical mechanistic models, based on the mass and momentum balance with bottom friction along the powder bed, are numerically challenging to solve. The model requires use of rheometrical benchmark tests to determine the flow index coefficients for a specific quality of alumina for a given initial inlet bed depth and steady state estimated capacity. The use of an Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) solver in MATLAB to predict the height and the velocity of alumina bed in an open channel seemed promising and showed similar trends when compared to the alumina bed results obtained from the air slide tests conducted at POSTEC. Results obtained so far indicate that a more detailed analysis needs to be conducted in order to find out how to ‘fine tune’ the model parameters to further improve the model fit to measurement data. Although more experimental data is needed, e. g. shear stress measurements and flow coefficients at different fluidization velocities and for different alumina qualities, the correlation between measurements and the model obtained so far confirmed that further investigation would be justified. Thus, the effect of interfaces, the feeding silo and the stand pipe should be considered and included into further design approaches for mechanical equipment, by balancing headroom availability in <b>pot</b> <b>rooms</b> versus increase in transport capacity of bulk solids to optimize production...|$|R
