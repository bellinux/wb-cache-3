40|$|A {{study of}} {{two hundred and fifty}} (250) public school {{teachers}} employed in a partial regional school district was conducted in order to examine their attitudes toward various forms of <b>parent</b> participation with the schools. Teachers {{were asked to respond to}} a fifty (50) statement survey investigating seven categories of <b>parent</b> involvement. These categories included: <b>parent</b> and teacher relationships; <b>parents</b> as supporters; <b>parents</b> as an audience; <b>parents</b> as decision makers; <b>parents</b> as advocates; <b>parents</b> as tutors for their children; and <b>parents</b> as learners. ^ The purpose of the study was to determine if any differences in attitude existed among these teachers concerning <b>parent</b> participation in the schools. Comparisons were made among the teachers according to grade level, educational background, age, family status, formal training for <b>parent</b> involvement, years of service, and gender. ^ Several interesting patterns emerged from this investigation. The results indicated that there are significant differences among teachers at the elementary, junior high, and high school levels toward <b>parent</b> involvement with the schools. ^ Elementary school teachers revealed more positive attitudes toward <b>parent</b> involvement than junior high and high school teachers in the areas of <b>parent</b> and teacher relationships, <b>parents</b> as supporters of the schools, and <b>parents</b> as tutors assisting their children with school related activities. ^ Significant differences surfaced between elementary school and the junior high teachers concerning <b>parents</b> as an audience for school activities. High school and junior high teachers disagreed concerning the role of <b>parents</b> as learners in the schools. ^ Other factors also influenced teacher attitudes toward <b>parent</b> participation. A significant difference surfaced between teachers who had received training for <b>parent</b> involvement activities and those who had not participated in any training programs. Teachers who are <b>parents</b> also held views that differed from those who are not <b>parents</b> concerning <b>parent</b> involvement. Examination of the teacher responses by gender revealed that the attitudes of male and female teachers differed concerning <b>parent</b> participation with the schools. ^ Age, years of experience, and educational background did not significantly affect the attitudes of the teachers toward <b>parent</b> involvement with the schools. ...|$|R

5|$|There {{is also a}} {{considerable}} variety of treatments for alleged attachment disorders diagnosed on the controversial alternative basis outlined above, popularly known as attachment therapy. These therapies {{have little or no}} evidence base and vary from talking or play therapies to more extreme forms of physical and coercive techniques, of which the best known are holding therapy, rebirthing, rage-reduction and the Evergreen model. In general these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. Critics maintain these therapies are not based on an accepted version of attachment theory. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of regression and catharsis, accompanied by <b>parenting</b> methods which emphasise obedience and parental control. These therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver. An estimated six children have died {{as a consequence of the}} more coercive forms of such treatments and the application of the accompanying <b>parenting</b> techniques.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} <b>parent</b> {{involvement in}} Early Childhood Development (ECD) centres in Masiphumelele, Cape Town. The researcher aimed {{to gain an}} understanding of the following; how <b>parents</b> are involved in Early Childhood Development centres, factors that enhance <b>parent</b> involvement in ECD centres, factors that hinder <b>parent</b> involvement in ECD centres and challenges faced by <b>parents</b> in getting involved in ECD centres. This research study adopted a qualitative, exploratory approach using a semi-structured interview schedule. The researcher used non-probability, purposive sampling to select the participants. Nineteen participants were interviewed using an interview schedule as a guide. The data collected was analyzed using Tesch's (1990) method of analysis. The research findings revealed that even though there are <b>parents</b> who participate in activities taking place at ECD centres, there is still lack of <b>parent</b> involvement in ECD centres. The thesis affirms that unity among <b>parents,</b> take-home activities, hosting general <b>parent</b> meetings, effective communication between <b>parents</b> and ECD staff especially teachers, <b>parent</b> days, hosting <b>parent</b> workshops, adopting a positive attitude towards <b>parents,</b> <b>parent</b> class visits and adequate physical space are factors that enhance <b>parent</b> involvement in ECD centres. Evidence from the research study show that lack of time, single parenthood, lack of interest, lack of education, poverty and unemployment are factors that inhibit <b>parent</b> involvement in ECD centres. According to the research findings, challenges that <b>parents</b> face in getting involved are; coping, trust issues, participation in education activities, provision of basic needs and payment of ECD centre fees. The study recommends that ECD centres should initiate <b>parent</b> involvement programmes so that <b>parents</b> gain skills and self-confidence. <b>Parents</b> are then more likely to be involved in their children's education...|$|R

This study analyzed existing data collected for a national <b>parent</b> involvement study. The sample consisted of 2, 051 parent-child pairs (1, 443 Head Start and 606 non-Head Start). Findings indicated a significant relationship between numerous family characteristics and <b>parent</b> involvement in Head Start, with variables related to a higher level of education of the mother or primary caregiver being the most dominant. Significant differences were found between the <b>parents</b> who participated in Head Start activities and <b>parents</b> who did not participate. The involved <b>parents</b> felt more strongly about teachers needing knowledge of their children's families, <b>parents</b> having knowledge worthy of sharing with their children's teachers, and <b>parents</b> wanting advice or input from their children's teachers. They reported a higher frequency of behaviors such as talking, reading, and playing with their children, trying to teach their children basic concepts, and having materials available for their children's use. Involved <b>parents</b> rated their level of participation, acceptance, and influence in their communities to be greater than did the uninvolved <b>parents.</b> Also, they had higher expectations concerning their children's education.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare two groups of <b>parents</b> whose {{children}} participated in ABA on their levels of stress, self-efficacy, treatment acceptability, and parents’ level of involvement in their children’s treatment, and to assess variables that may explain variance in <b>parent</b> involvement. <b>Parents</b> in the treatment group participated in a voluntary <b>parent</b> training (n= 18) and the comparison group were <b>parents</b> who elected not to participate in the voluntary training (n= 22). This was a quasi-experimental design study where <b>parents</b> and their therapists completed a survey regarding parents’ involvement in their children’s treatment programs. Additional <b>parent</b> measures collected as part of the children’s treatment were also reviewed to assess changes in <b>parent</b> stress, self-efficacy, and treatment acceptability. A major finding in this study was that there were significant improvements in both <b>parent</b> self-efficacy and treatment acceptability in the treatment group. However, when comparing the differences in gains between the groups, the average gains of the treatment group were not significantly different than those of the comparison group. Findings also indicated that the treatment group was rated as having significantly higher levels of involvement by the therapists, but not by the <b>parents</b> themselves. Multiple regression analyses assessing the relationship between <b>parent</b> involvement and 1) <b>parent</b> stress, 2) self-efficacy, and 3) treatment acceptability did not indicate significant results when retrospective data from the client files were used to measure <b>parent</b> stress, self-efficacy, and treatment acceptability. However, a follow up regression analysis, using additional measures, was able to explain 49 % of variance in <b>parent</b> involvement. These results suggest that the levels of <b>parent</b> stress, self-efficacy, and treatment acceptability may be important constructs to consider when attempting to improve <b>parent</b> involvement. Results of a hierarchical regression analysis suggested that <b>parent</b> training explained variance in <b>parent</b> involvement above and beyond what was already explained by <b>parent</b> stress, self-efficacy, and treatment acceptability. Further results indicated that variance explained in <b>parent</b> involvement by <b>parent</b> training was dependent on self-efficacy. This indicated that there was some benefit to the <b>parent</b> training in regards to <b>parent</b> involvement and that self-efficacy was a major contributor to the relationship between <b>parent</b> training and <b>parent</b> involvement.
