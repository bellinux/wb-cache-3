All 34 on board were killed. The aircraft was on an international non-scheduled passenger flight from Palm Beach International Airport, United States to Grand Bahama International Airport. Although {{the cause of the}} accident was never determined, it is known that the aircraft flew into a thunderstorm and that there were pre-existing deficiencies with the <b>pitot</b> tube <b>and</b> <b>static</b> <b>system</b> on the aircraft. Florida Commuter Airlines were criticized for their poor maintenance regime.|$|R

The IFR navaid related instruments and circuits from an ATC 610 J table top simulator were installed in a Cessna 172 aircraft and connected to its electrical power <b>and</b> <b>pitot</b> <b>static</b> <b>systems.</b> The benefits expected from this hybridization concept include increased safety by {{reducing the number of}} general aviation aircraft conducting IFR training flights in congested terminal areas, and reduced fuel use and instruction costs by lessening the need to fly to and from navaid equipped airports and by increased efficiency of the required in-flight training. Technical feasibility was demonstrated and the operational feasibility of the concept was evaluated.

Experiments were performed at stagnation ethalpies of 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 MJ/kg and stagnation pressures of 20 and 40 MPa. The free-stream Mach number was approximately 7 for all test condi-tions. A core flow region of approximately 600 mm diameter was observed. Good repeatability of the <b>Pitot</b> <b>and</b> <b>static</b> pressure was obtained at all test conditions...|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} {{altimeter}} and vertical speed indicator, the airspeed indicator {{is a member}} of the pitot-static system of aviation instruments, so named because they operate by measuring pressure in the <b>pitot</b> <b>and</b> <b>static</b> circuits.|$|R

50|$|Instead of {{separate}} <b>pitot</b> <b>and</b> <b>static</b> ports, a pitot-static tube (also called a Prandtl tube) may be employed, {{which has a}} second tube coaxial with the pitot tube with holes on the sides, outside the direct airflow, to measure the static pressure.|$|R
50|$|The air data {{reference}} (ADR) {{component of}} an ADIRU provides airspeed, Mach number, angle of attack, temperature and barometric altitude data. Ram air pressure <b>and</b> <b>static</b> pressures used in calculating airspeed are measured by small ADMs located {{as close as}} possible to the respective <b>pitot</b> <b>and</b> <b>static</b> pressure sensors. ADMs transmit their pressures to the ADIRUs through ARINC 429 data buses.|$|R
50|$|The {{airspeed}} indicator {{is connected to}} both the <b>pitot</b> <b>and</b> <b>static</b> pressure sources. The difference between the <b>pitot</b> pressure <b>and</b> the <b>static</b> pressure is called dynamic pressure. The greater the dynamic pressure, the higher the airspeed reported.

The higher the speed, the higher the ram pressure, the more pressure exerted on the diaphragm, and the larger the needle movement through the mechanical linkage.|$|R

The flow-field pressure probe contains four major components: 1) Static pressure aerodynamic tip; 2) Pressure-sensing cartridge assembly; 3) Pitot pressure aerodynamic tip; 4) Mounting stem. This modular design allows for a variety of probe tips to be used for a specific application. Here, the focus is on flow-field pressure measurements in supersonic flows, so we developed a cone-cylinder <b>static</b> pressure tip <b>and</b> a <b>pitot</b> pressure tip. Alternatively, probe tips optimized for subsonic and transonic flows could be used with this design. The pressure-sensing cartridge assembly allows the simultaneous measurement of steady-state and transient pressure which allows continuous calibration of the dynamic pressure transducer...|$|R

40|$|Supersonic air jets {{from the}} D'Laval nozzle of {{designed}} Mach number 2. 0 were experimentally investigated. Some typical flow patterns of overexpanded, designed and underexpanded flows were observed by the schlieren {{system and the}} various pressure measurements. Then, the normal shock wave standing just at the nozzle exit in the overexpanded flow was cleared as {{to be recognized as}} a pseudo-shock wave, because the normal shock wave had interacted with the shear layer of jet boundary and the compression region of the shock wave was lengthened to some diameters of the nozzle exit. The <b>pitot</b> <b>and</b> <b>static</b> pressure along the jet axis were varied up and down alternately influenced by the shock waves and expansion waves in the pseudo-shock wave. Both of the <b>pitot</b> <b>and</b> <b>static</b> pressure distributions normal to the flow axis had two or more peaks in the region of pseudo-shock, because of the existence of λ type or X type shock waves.

Useful test core diameters along with the corresponding free-stream conditions and usable testing times were determined. For the M 13. 5 condition, in-stream static pressure surveys showed the temporal and spacial uniformity of this quantity across the useful test core.

50|$|Modern tube anemometers use {{the same}} {{principle}} as in the Dines anemometer but using a different design. The implementation uses a pitot-static tube which is a pitot tube with two ports, <b>pitot</b> <b>and</b> <b>static,</b> that is normally used in measuring the airspeed of aircraft. The pitot port measures the dynamic pressure of the open mouth of a tube with pointed head facing wind, <b>and</b> the <b>static</b> port measures the static pressure from small holes along the side on that tube. The pitot tube is connected to a tail so that it always makes the tube's head to face the wind. Additionally, the tube is heated to prevent rime ice formation on the tube. There are two lines from the tube down to the devices to measure the difference in pressure of the two lines. The measurement devices can be manometers, pressure transducers, or analog chart recorders.|$|R
