For those beneficiaries who are unable to manage their own affairs, VA appoints a third party, called a fiduciary, to manage their VA funds. Congress, VA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) and GAO have noted that VA does not always have, or adhere to, effective policies for selecting and monitoring fiduciaries and therefore, does not fully safeguard the assets of beneficiaries in the Fiduciary Program.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to be against accountability for public schools. Schools are creatures {{of state and local}} government, with all the associated expectations of <b>performance</b> and <b>oversight.</b> The importance of education for individuals and for society is unassailable. But many believe that U. S. schools are not contributing {{as much as they could}} and are not competitive in comparisons with those of other countries. Thus, the desire to hold schools responsible for outcomes is natural. The disagreement comes, however, soon after people acknowledge the importance of school accountability. How should performance be assessed? Is providing information on student outcomes sufficient to get improvement? Should there be explicit sanctions and rewards for students and/or schools? Do unintended consequences overwhelm the intended consequences? This paper considers some of the basic features of school accountability systems and assesses both the incentives for change that are imbedded in these systems and the existing evidence we have about behavior under different systems. The essential features that we consider are focus, scope of measurement, design, and incentives. “Focus ” describes the mix of factors examined within accountability systems. “Scope ” considers the extent to which the accountability system captures the full range of school activities for each of the factors under review. “Design ” refers to the specific approaches to measuring the schools...|$|R

40|$|Pressure on {{boards to}} improve {{corporate}} <b>performance</b> and management <b>oversight</b> {{has led to}} a series of inquiries and reports advocating governance reform. These reports largely reflect an agency perspective of governance and seek to ensure greater board independence from and control of management. While board independence is important to good governance, we contend that frameworks, models and advice centred on one element of governance ignore the complexity of how boards work. We develop a holistic board framework based upon the concept of board intellectual capital to address this concern. Our framework proposes a series of inputs (e. g. company history, company constitution, legal environment) that lead to a particular mix of board intellectual capital. We contend that the balance of the different elements of board intellectual capital will lead to a series of board behaviours. Further, the board needs to mobilise its intellectual capital to carry out a series of roles. The exact nature of these roles will depend on the company 2 ̆ 7 s requirements. Thus, the governance outputs of organisational performance, board effectiveness and director effectiveness will depend on the match between the board 2 ̆ 7 s intellectual capital and the roles required of it. We conclude by demonstrating the benefits of this framework as a diagnostic tool. We outline how boards wishing to improve their governance systems can diagnose common governance problems by evaluating their own board 2 ̆ 7 s capabilities in relation to the different components of the framework...|$|R

The {{autonomy}} {{of law enforcement}} has been addressed {{by the development of}} civilian oversight agencies/entities. These agencies aim to provide accountability of law enforcement through civilian review of police policies, independent civilian investigations of citizen complaints against the police, and through civilian review of police investigations of citizen complaints. Although civilian oversight of law enforcement has been developing since the late 1940 s there has been little research on the topic. There is little research on characteristics of specific oversight agencies and even less research on measuring the <b>performance</b> of civilian <b>oversight.</b> 	This exploratory study aspired to learn about the structures and functions of four specific oversight agencies, and to compare these agencies using performance measures identified in existing literature. The sources of data for this study are qualitative interviews. The interviewees consist of five classifications of individuals associated with oversight agencies in some manner. 	This study found that the varying structure and function of each oversight agency yielded both positive and negative results. The political influences on oversight agencies and the authority of the oversight agencies were found to be sources of contention that impeded their missions. The criticism in existing literature that civilians do not have the necessary training and experience to hold police departments accountable was corroborated by the interviews. Most importantly this study found that none of these oversight agencies actively employed measures to evaluate their own performance. Furthermore, when this study applied performance measures identified in existing literature, it found the oversight agencies were deficient. Criminal Justic...|$|R
40|$|Mintrop {{examines}} {{the degree to}} which California’s systems of public school accountability and state oversight enable the state to ensure that students in the state’s lowest performing schools have educational opportunities equal to those in other schools. He finds that California’s current system of state oversight lacks standards of adequacy for learning conditions that can potentially be evaluated statewide and that schools can use to evaluate themselves. While the state’s accountability system as currently constructed defines standards of student and school performance {{with the help of the}} academic performance index (API), the state lacks mechanisms to identify performance barriers systematically across schools that do not meet adequate performance standards, as defined by API growth targets. Many performance barriers encountered by schools are systemic, that is, caused by district (and state) policies, yet the current school-based accountability system ignores this. As a result, the state has no way of knowing what statewide policies and local interventions are needed to move underperforming schools to adequate <b>performance</b> levels. Further, <b>oversight</b> and support to schools and districts that are in need or distress according to the state’s own performance criteria are insufficient. Large numbers of schools that qualify for the state’s Immediate Intervention/Underperforming Schools Program (II/USP) are not reached through state oversight or support. Moreover, there is little evidence that the state has developed effective intervention systems for a sizable number of schools and districts that have not improved sufficiently according to the state’s own performance criteria.

Additionally, HRSA did not demonstrate a risk-based strategy for selecting grantees for site visits. Project officers (POs) do not consistently document routine monitoring or {{follow up on that}} monitoring to help grantees address problems, as required by HHS and HRSA guidance. The purpose of routine monitoring is to enable POs to answer grantee questions about program requirements, provide technical assistance (TA), and follow up on grantee corrective actions in response to previously provided TA. However, GAO found that most POs did not document routine monitoring calls with granteesonly 4 of the 25 PO files GAO reviewed from 2010 and 8 of the 25 files GAO reviewed from 2011 contained documentation of monitoring calls at least quarterly. HRSA often did not follow HHS regulations and guidance in implementing restrictive drawdowns, a special award condition HRSA can place on grantees with serious problems. Restrictive drawdown requires that prior to spending any grant funds, grantees must submit a request, along with documentation of the need, for funds for HRSA review. Six of the 52 Part A grantees and 13 of the 59 Part B grantees were placed on restrictive drawdown from 2008 through 2011. GAO found that HRSA did not consistently provide grantees in GAOs sample that were on restrictive drawdown with the reasons the restrictive drawdown was implemented, instructions for meeting the conditions of the restrictive drawdown, or guidance on the types of corrective actions needed. This has limited the effectiveness of restrictive drawdown as a tool for improving grantee <b>performance.</b> Regarding the <b>oversight</b> of grantees through site visits, HRSA did not demonstrate a clear strategy for selecting the grantees it visited from 2008 through 2011.
