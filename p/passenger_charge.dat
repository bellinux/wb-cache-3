2500|$|The airport {{announced}} on 24 May 2016 {{that it would}} cease civilian operations by 1 November 2016, stating that the Norwegian air <b>passenger</b> <b>charge</b> made Rygge uncompetitive. Ryanair, the airport's largest customer (the only other airline offering a few regular services being Norwegian Air Shuttle), had earlier announced it would pull out of Rygge if the air <b>passenger</b> <b>charge</b> was not removed. Ryanair accounted for around two thirds of traffic {{at the airport and}} served 29 destinations, of which 16 were year-round, from Moss/Rygge as of October 2016. Business travellers did not really use the airport. Attempts were made by typical business airlines on domestic flights and destinations like London, which were not successful. [...] Business travellers usually require frequent departures and Ryanair offered sparse schedules with often a few flights per destination and week. The attempts on domestic flights were also less attractive since Rygge could not compete with Gardermoen on frequency.|$|E
50|$|In 2006 the Isle of Wight Council {{considered}} {{converting the}} floating bridge to only transport vehicles across the River Medina, {{setting up a}} launch for pedestrians with a charge of 50p. Prior to this {{the last time a}} foot <b>passenger</b> <b>charge</b> was in operation was until 1992, when the vehicle tolls were raised from 75p to £1.25 to compensate for any lost income. While this initially resulted in a slump in crossings from 300,000 to less than 210,000 in 1993, as the diversion travelling via Newport became more congested the popularity of the floating bridge began to rise again. The argument was put forward that by taking out passenger compartments the overall capacity of the ferry could be increased by up to 30 per cent. Following this it was hoped with a prudent approach to future toll increases the ferry route could become profitable. It has historically always made a loss. However, the idea of introducing a charge was very unpopular with local residents, councillors and businesses and the threat receded. Earlier vessels included stairs to give passengers access to roofs covering the vehicle deck, a feature not present on Bridge No. 5.|$|E

40|$|While airport {{aeronautical}} {{charges are}} traditionally aircraft weight related, currently an increasing share of aeronautical airport revenues {{is derived from}} <b>passenger</b> related <b>charges.</b> This paper compares the optimal mix of per-passenger and per-flight based (cost recovering) airport charges from the carriers and the social viewpoints when carrier markets are oligopolistic. We show that positive per- <b>passenger</b> <b>charges</b> {{might be able to}} support the implementation of monopoly fares at slot-constrained airports. They can also mitigate strategic frequency reductions at uncongested airports, leading to an increase in both carrier profit and welfare relative to a charging scheme that fully relies on per-flight charges...|$|R

50|$|Compass I was Australia's first {{low cost}} airline. It was {{established}} following {{deregulation of the}} Australian airline industry in 1990. Previously Ansett and the government-owned Australian Airlines had operated under the Two Airlines Policy, which {{was in fact a}} legal barrier to new entrants to the Australian aviation market. It restricted intercapital services to the two major domestic carriers. This anti-competitive arrangement ensured that they carried approximately the same number of <b>passengers,</b> <b>charged</b> the same fares and had similar fleet sizes and equipment.|$|R

By February 5, 1990, Mayor Daley released a feasibility study for the Lake Calumet Site which indicated that the $5 billion cost to construct the airport would be partially funded by a <b>passenger</b> facility <b>charge</b> which would generate $1.8 billion. Federal legislation sealed the <b>passenger</b> facility <b>charges</b> on August 2, 1990 in the 101st congress 2nd session through H.R. 5170.|$|R
