40|$|Composite Steel-Concrete {{construction}} {{is widely used}} in buildings and bridges even in regions of high seismic risk. It is now common practice to use cold formed steel sheets as permanent formwork {{for the support of}} the soffits of reinforced concrete and also as part of the tension steel in the composite beam that is formed after the concrete has hardened. The construction should ensure monolithic action between the prefabricated steel and in-situ concrete so that they act as a single structural unit. Structural elements, such as anchors, studs, channels and spirals, intended to transmit the horizontal shear between the <b>prefabricated</b> <b>member</b> and the cast-in-situ concrete and also to prevent vertical separation at the interface. Shear connectors, anchors (hoops, loops, and struts) are used as a means for comprising steel and concrete, as well as friction through high value crews and their combination. There is a common term – Shear connectors that defines the various forms of steel structural parts connected to the upper segment of the steel plate most often by welding. In this experimental analysis the T-shape shear connectors will be used in composite beams as they have the highest characteristic resistance and the mode of failure changes for different concrete strengths and different arrangements. Moreover the shear connectors will be provided in various arrangements and the optimum location which gives the high flexural and shear strength going to be arrived. The flexural strength between conventional reinforced concrete beam and composite beams with shear connector is were compared and found that the T-Connectors facing the centre of beam (NT- 2) holds the cold formed steel well with the concrete compared to other composite beam...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Accelerated bridge {{construction}} (ABC) {{has become a}} popular means to reduce the impact of replacement and new {{bridge construction}} {{on the economy and}} traveling public. This project investigated the use of grouted couplers for connecting precast (prefabricated) bridges columns, which can be used in ABC, with conventional reinforced concrete footings. These devices were evaluated experimentally as individual components and in large-scale precast bridge column test specimens. Using test data, methods for calculating the response of columns with grouted coupler connections were also developed. Results indicate that the drift capacity of column models with grouted couplers was lower than that of a similar cast-in-place column. However, the drift capacity of columns with grouted couplers was 6 %, which may be sufficient for many applications. Background Accelerated bridge construction (ABC) has become increasingly popular throughout the United States because of numerous advantages such as decreased bridge construction time, reduced overall project cost, and reduced impact on the environment and traveling public. To effectively accomplish ABC projects, designers use <b>prefabricated</b> structural <b>members</b> that can be produced in factories, shipped to the construction site, and rapidly assembled upo...|$|R

40|$|Accelerated bridge {{construction}} (ABC) {{relies heavily on}} <b>prefabricated</b> reinforced concrete <b>members.</b> One method to connect prefabricated columns to footings or cap beams is {{through the use of}} mechanical bar splices commonly referred to as couplers. Even though current seismic codes prohibit application of couplers in the plastic hinge area of columns located in moderate and high seismic zones, recent studies have revealed the feasibility of precast columns utilizing couplers in the plastic hinge zones helping expand ABC in this zones. Several types of mechanical bar splices each with a unique performance and anchoring mechanism are available in the U. S. market. Five of these were included in this study: shear screw, headed bar, grouted, threaded, and swaged couplers.

40|$|In {{conventional}} cast-in-place {{reinforced concrete}} bridge construction, cap beams and their connection to columns {{are designed to}} be capacity protected under strong earthquakes. This is because cap beams and their connections maintain structural integrity and are difficult to repair. The same design philosophy is mandatory for precast cap beams that are used in accelerated bridge construction (ABC), particularly in moderate and high seismic zones. One of the key components of ABC is <b>prefabricated</b> reinforced concrete <b>members.</b> The NCHRP report 698 provided a synthesis of different promising ABC connections.

40|$|Structural frames made of {{prefabricated}} {{laminated timber}} beams and columns connected by unbonded post-tensioning and additional mild steel reinforcement {{have recently been}} proposed for multi-storey timber buildings (referred to as "Pres-Lam®" technology). The benefits of post-tensioning to assemble prefabricated timber elements are rapid erection, simple connections, and high seismic resistance. <b>Prefabricated</b> post-tensioned timber <b>members</b> can be designed to have excellent seismic resistance, with the post-tensioning providing re-centering capacity after major earthquakes, while energy is dissipated through yielding of replaceable mild steel devices. Both post-tensioning and mild steel devices contribute to the stiffness and strength of the overall system. This paper summarizes a large experimental investigation into the seismic response of full-scale timber beam-column joints, performed {{as part of a}} larger research programme on timber structures at the University of Canterbury. The beams and columns were fabricated from laminated veneer lumber (LVL). The tested joint was designed for a moment-resisting frame for a six-storey building located in a high-seismic region. The timber members and the re-centering/dissipating elements were optimized to produce the intended behaviour. Commercially available prestressing arrangements were used, with post-tensioning forces up to 1000 kN. The mild steel energy dissipaters wee attached externally so that they could be removed and replaced easily after a major earthquake. Both exterior and interior joints were tested. This paper presents the results of the experiments on interior beam-column joints, showing excellent seismic behaviour with very little residual damage. These full-scale tests demonstrate the practical feasibility of post-tensioned timber frames for multi storey timber buildings as well as their excellent behaviour in seismic regions...|$|R
40|$|By using {{non-metallic}} textile reinforcements for concrete structures, {{the concrete}} cover {{can be reduced}} significantly compared to ordinary steel-reinforcements resulting in thin-walled, slender and light-weight concrete structures. The weight of the structure can be largely reduced which is important especially for <b>prefabricated</b> concrete <b>members.</b> Next to non-impregnated textiles, today, textiles which are impregnated are mainly used as reinforcement. Due to the impregnation and the following curing process, tensile stresses up to 3000 MPa can be achieved depending on the fiber material. Furthermore, impregnated textiles can be shaped both as planar and spatial reinforcement structures, additionally, are robust and inherently stable and, thus, are suitable as reinforcements in concrete structures. Today, fibers made of alkali-resistant glass or carbon are commonly used as reinforcing materials combined with epoxy-resin or styrene-butadiene as impregnation-materials. For the design of textile-reinforced concrete structures {{it is necessary to}} use calculation models, which have been applicable only for non-impregnated textiles. This PhD-Thesis deals with impregnated textile reinforcements for concrete members. Experimental and theoretical investigations regarding the load-bearing behavior under tensile loads, bending moments and shear forces are presented. Furthermore, the bond behavior is characterized and, {{with the help of the}} derived bond laws, anchorage lengths as wells as overlapping lengths are derived. Those lengths are in the range between 20 mm to 100 mm for textiles which are impregnated with epoxy resin and between 120 mm to 320 mm for styrene butadiene. In addition it is shown, that the bond laws are suitable for calculating crack widths. The theoretical investigations are based on an experimental database, which has been build up within the scope of this thesis and consist of nearly 600 single tests. The tensile behavior is influenced by the lateral contraction of the rovings. For bend-ing loads it is shown, that the resistant bending moment can be calculated in a pure mechanical way similar to the procedure as it is known from steel-reinforced concrete members. The shear-behavior has been investigated on slabs (rectangular cross-section with slab thicknesses between 30 mm and 60 mm, without shear reinforcement) and I-beams (with and without shear reinforcement). The main failure mode of the slabs was a diagonal shear-failure occurring already at small reinforcement-ratios. Next to the transfer of the shear loads over the compression zone a distinctive dowel-action was investigated, which can be up to 50 % of the overall shear force. In contrast to this, the main shear forces of the I-beams without shear reinforcement were transferred via the compression zone. For the beams with shear reinforcement it was found, that the shear reinforcement can be utilized up to 40 % of the strain observed in the roving tests. Finally, engineering models for tensile loads, bending moments and shear forces have been derived, which can be used now for calculating concrete members reinforced with impregnated textiles...|$|R

This article summarizes the results of an investigation into the seismic response of full-scale timber beam-column joints, subjected to extensive experimental study and numerical modelling, performed {{as part of a larger}} research program on timber structures at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. The beams and columns were fabricated from laminated veneer lumber (LVL). The tested joint was designed as part of a moment-resisting frame for a six-story building located in a high-seismic region. The timber members and the re-centering/dissipating elements were optimized to produce the intended dissipating-recentering behavior and commercially available prestressing arrangements were used to verify their applicability in a timber structure. The results of the experiments on both interior and exterior beam-column joints are presented, for both post-tensioned-only and hybrid models. The post-tensioned-only solutions exhibited nonlinear elastic behavior with full re-centering while the hybrid systems provided significantly greater levels of energy dissipation compared with the post-tensioned-only solution. The joints were also tested with a number of additional features such as steel armoring plates at the interface, reinforcement in the form of long screws embedded into the column and combination of the two. The armored the column faces with steel plates exhibited higher stiffness and smaller deformation in compression perpendicular to the grain. The joint region within reinforced column reduce the subsequent drop in prestressing forces in the system. Combination of armoring and reinforcements protect the joint region through minimizing joint shear panel deformation. In general, the tested arrangements exhibited high levels of ductility and negligible residual deformations with no significant damage of the structural elements. The numerical models accurately predict the behavior of different types of beam-column joints tested and can be used to design similar connections. These full-scale tests also demonstrate the practical feasibility of post-tensioned timber frames for multi-story timber buildings...|$|R
