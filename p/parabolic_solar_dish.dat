We {{present an}} analytic function {{to calculate the}} intercept factor of the system with real sun bright distribution and Gaussian distribution, {{the results indicate that}} the intercept factor is related to the rim angle of reflector and the ratio of open angle of receiver at the top of reflector to optical error when the optical error is larger than or equal to 5 mrad, but is related to the rim angle, open angle and optical error in less than 5 mrad optical error. Furthermore we propose a quick process to optimize the system to provide the maximum solar energy to net heat efficiency for different optical error under typical condition.

40|$|Wind flow around <b>parabolic</b> <b>dish</b> <b>solar</b> {{concentrators}} {{can significantly}} affect {{the loss of}} heat from the receiver, and thus the performance of these systems. Numerous {{studies have examined the}} heat loss from various receiver geometries under natural and forced convection conditions; however there is a marked absence of studies that take into account the effect that the dish may have on the heat loss, particularly for forced convection conditions. Given that forced convection can greatly increase the heat loss from such systems, {{there is a need for}} an improved understanding of the effect of the wind velocity and flow structure around <b>parabolic</b> <b>dish</b> <b>solar</b> concentrators. In this work, computational fluid dynamics is used to model the flow of air around a parabolic dish concentrator operating at varying angles of attack. The results show that the orientation of the dish has a significant effect on the flow structure near the receiver. For flows normal to the surface of the dish, fore or aft, the dish acts much like a bluff body, or pressure blockage, “shielding” the receiver from the flow, such that the air velocities near the receiver are relatively low. However, other operating conditions exhibit recirculation areas near the receiver that could lead to increased heat loss. Further work is required to determine the magnitude of this effect and subsequently the overall effect on the performance of <b>parabolic</b> <b>dish</b> <b>solar</b> concentrators...|$|R
40|$|The work {{consists}} of {{the design of the}} chain drive system and the fabrication of the two axis <b>parabolic</b> <b>solar</b> <b>dish.</b> It is a model study of the two axis parabolic dish which worked by the automatic circuit that was developed. Ready made <b>parabolic</b> <b>solar</b> <b>dish</b> is taken and fabricated. The circular iron ring provides the two axis motion of the dish. A compound chain drive system was developed for the smooth movement of the dish.

A C program was made which gave the required result for the graphical representation of the recorded radiation. Programmable Logic Controls (PLC) was used instead of photo sensors, which are widely used for tracking the sun. The azimuthal angle of the sun from sunrise to sunset times was calculated for each day of the year at 23. 59 Lat & 72. 38 Longitude in the Northern hemisphere, the location of the city Mehsana. According to this azimuth angle, the required analog signal was taken from the PLC analog module and sent to the power window motor, which controlled the position of the panel to ensure that the rays fall vertically on the panel. After the mechanical control of the system was started, the performance measurements of the solar panel were carried out.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to design a low cost <b>parabolic</b> <b>solar</b> <b>dish</b> concentrator with small-to moderate size for direct electricity generation. Such model can be installed in rural areas which are not connected to governmental grid. Three diameters of the dish; 5, 10 and 20 m are investigated and the focal point to dish diameter ratio is set to be 0. 3 in all studied cases. Special attention is given to the selection of the appropriate dimensions of the reflecting surfaces to be cut from the available sheets in the market aiming to reduce both cutting cost and sheets cost. The dimensions of the ribs and rings which support the reflecting surface are optimized in order to minimize the entire weight of the dish while providing the minimum possible total deflection and stresses in the beams. The study applies full stress analysis of the frame of the dish using Autodesk Inventor.
