40|$|This paper {{examines}} the circular debt {{problem in the}} Pakistani energy sector. After presenting {{the profile of the}} energy sector in Pakistan, the paper explains why circular debt has emerged in the sector. Two principal reasons are discussed for the circular debt problem: First, consumer tariffs were insufficient to recover the rising costs of power generation and the government (due to fiscal constraints) was not compensating PEPCO for the resulting losses. Second, PEPCO has faced significant problems in recovering dues from consumers. In order to resolve the circular debt problem, sharp adjustments in <b>power</b> <b>tariffs</b> may be required combined with the need by the government to explicitly recognize the costs of power subsidies in the budget...|$|R

The peak load met was 156,934 MW with a short fall of requirement by 2,608 MW (-1.6%) against the 2.6% surplus anticipated. In LGBR 2017 report, India's Central Electricity Authority anticipated for the 2017-18 fiscal year, energy surplus and peaking surplus to be 8.8% and 6.8% respectively. Though few states are expected to face energy shortage, power would be made available adequately from the surplus regions with the higher capacity inter regional transmission links.

40|$|In most industrialized {{countries}} electric <b>power</b> <b>tariffs</b> for residential consumption {{are higher than}} for industrial customers. In Russia, as in some other transition countries, this pattern is reversed, {{but at the same}} time the overall level of tariffs is very low. Cross subsidization of residential tariffs through industrial tariffs has been repeatedly criticized by economists and international organizations. This note argues that, while it is inefficient to keep tariffs below social cost, cross subsidies can be efficient. In fact, back of the envelop calculations for Russia suggest, that, given the prevailing level of tariffs, which is much too low, their structure is probably efficient. 0 The author thanks Svetlana Ikonnikova for research assistance and Alexander Martussevich for information on power cost...|$|R

40|$|In this Highlight, {{we examine}} {{historical}} antecedents of energy-irrigation nexus in India {{and find that}} its genesis lies in policy decision taken over two decades ago to supply unmetered electricity to farmers.

This in turn has led to a crisis in all three sectors- energy, groundwater and agriculture. In response, different state governments have tried different solutions to reduce negative impacts of this nexus. In this Highlight, we arrive at a broad typology of these solutions and conclude that text-book solutions like universal metering and commercial <b>power</b> <b>tariffs,</b> though very effective and tried in a few states, are unlikely to be politically acceptable everywhere. In the meanwhile, second best solutions like feeder segregation and improving quality of power supply through technical interventions will have to suffice...|$|R
