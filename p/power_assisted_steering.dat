25|$|Two {{models were}} offered: AN68/1R (9.4m in length) and AN68/2R (10.2m in length). <b>Power</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> was {{standard}} on the AN68/2R and optional on the AN68/1R. The steering pump was power driven, which replaced the early belt driven system, while the only available engine {{was the new}} Leyland O.680. A wide variety of body styles from various manufacturers continued to be offered, allowing the Atlantean to be tailor made to requirements from operators ranging from the small independent to the large city corporation.|$|E
25|$|This {{new type}} of {{variable}} assist power steering has since spread throughout the vehicle population. DIRAVI as it was called, allowed great assistance to the motorist while parking, but little assistance at motorway speeds. The system adjusts the hydraulic pressure on the steering centering cam according to vehicle speed so {{that the amount of}} steering feel remained almost constant at any speed, counteracting the tendency of manual and ordinary <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> to feel light at high speed. Thus the car turns easily at low speed, emphasized by high gearing given two turns lock-lock, and relatively more effort is required at higher speed.|$|E

25|$|Ford also {{improved}} {{upon the}} handling {{characteristics of the}} GT500. The overall stance of the car has been lowered by 11 millimeters in front and 8 millimeters at the rear. The car also features Ford's new Electric <b>Power</b> <b>Assist</b> <b>Steering</b> (EPAS) that improves torque build-up and road feel which delivers quicker and more precise steering, increased effort on the racetrack or winding roads, and reduced effort in low-speed parking maneuvers. The car also has Ford's AdvanceTrac stability control system, which features a sport mode when pressed twice consecutively while stopped with the brakes applied.|$|R
50|$|This was {{the first}} commercially {{available}} variable <b>assist</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> arrangement, allowing the motorist <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> when parking, but recognizing that less steering assistance was needed at high speed. This feature is now spreading to mainstream vehicles, using electrical motors rather than hydraulic actuation.|$|R
2500|$|The Audi V8 came {{equipped}} with {{rack and pinion}} <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> (PAS) as standard. An electronically controlled variable assisted 'servotronic' version was also available. It was fitted with a high-performance brake system, which included radially ventilated disc brakes front and rear. [...] The fronts were rather unusual – designed by Continental AG and sized at [...] in diameter by [...] thick, but the caliper was mounted inside the disc. The fronts also incorporated electronic brake pad wear sensors. [...] The rears were [...] by , and incorporated a cable-operated parking brake. [...] A Bosch anti-lock braking system (ABS) was also standard.|$|E

50|$|This {{system should}} not be {{confused}} with variable <b>assist</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> which varies <b>steering</b> <b>assist</b> torque, not <b>steering</b> ratios, nor with systems where the gear ratio is only varied as a function of steering angle. These last are more accurately called non-linear types (e.g. Direct-Steer offered by Mercedes); a plot of steering-wheel position versus axle steering angle is progressively curved (and symmetrical).|$|R
50|$|Radar-based ACC often {{feature a}} precrash system, which warns the driver and/or {{provides}} brake support {{if there is}} a high risk of a collision. Also in certain cars it is incorporated with a lane maintaining system which provides a <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>assist</b> to reduce <b>steering</b> input burden on corners when the cruise control system is activated.|$|R

50|$|The years beyond 1920 saw several advancements, such as {{improved}} rural roads, {{the introduction}} of the diesel engine (which are 25-40% more efficient than gasoline engines), the standardization of truck and trailer sizes along with fifth wheel coupling systems, as well as <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> brakes and <b>steering.</b> By 1933, all states had some form of varying truck weight regulation.|$|R
50|$|The buses were {{designed}} and built {{in a period of}} severe shortages, the main emphasis being put on economizing material usage and simplicity of the design. Most buses of this type did not have <b>power</b> or <b>assisted</b> <b>steering,</b> and {{only a small number of}} buses, built in the early part of the project (1979-1982) employed automatic gearboxes, which were abandoned as solution due to high costs. The passenger area was also very spartan, having no interior sound or display systems, seats being built out of plywood,only later models were fitted with plastic seats, light fixtures being 6-8 small 12-volt light bulbs providing insufficient lighting.|$|R
50|$|Power was {{provided}} by a 140 hp 3.8L Essex V6 newly introduced to the Taurus/Sable for 1988. Exclusive to the Continental was adaptive air-ride suspension. Variable <b>assist</b> <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> was standard. In 1991, engine output was revised to 155 hp, and to 160 hp in 1993. All Continentals were equipped with a 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission.|$|R
50|$|ATF is {{also used}} as a {{hydraulic}} fluid in some <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> systems, as a lubricant in some 4WD transfer cases, and in some modern manual transmissions.|$|E
50|$|Power {{disc brakes}} and <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> were {{standard}} equipment on both body {{styles of the}} VE VIP. Additionally the Safari station wagon received an electrically operated tailgate window.|$|E
50|$|The Stilo was {{the second}} car {{worldwide}} to use the TRW Column-Drive Electric <b>Power</b> <b>Assisted</b> <b>Steering</b> (EPS) technology after the Fiat Punto MK2, later introduced on the 2003 Nissan Micra and Renault Mégane.|$|E
50|$|The {{reworked}} interior includes {{new materials}} for the door, console and dash panels, a new steering wheel and seats, and {{a wide range of}} trim packages with both leather and cloth seating. The refreshed interior also features a new instrument cluster featuring a 7-inch (180mm) TFT (Thin Film Transistor) display. The available 8.4 inch UConnect touchscreen radio with available navigation has been revised, now including UConnect Apps. Mechanically, the 3.6L Pentastar V6 and the 5.7L/6.4L HEMI engines remained the same. All engines are now backed by the ZF 8HP 8-Speed Automatic transmissions co-produced by ZF (previously only V6 models used the ZF 8-speed). There have been revisions to the chassis components, including Electric <b>Assist</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Steering,</b> which replaces the previous models Electro-Hydraulic <b>Assist</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Steering.</b> New aluminum rear differentials now use 4 mounting bolts for rigidity. AWD is no longer available on 5.7L R/T models.|$|R
5000|$|With the EPS system VDIM {{instantly}} varies {{the amount}} of <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>assist</b> depending on driving conditions. In vehicles equipped with Variable Gear Ratio Steering (VGRS), VDIM also manages steering gear ratios to help the driver maintain control. [...] Initially, the system was only offered on vehicles equipped with Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB), {{but this is no}} longer required.|$|R
40|$|This study {{illustrates}} the Electrically <b>Assisted</b> <b>power</b> <b>Steering</b> (EAS) using BLDC motor for a vehicle. Earlier the Electrically <b>Assisted</b> <b>power</b> <b>Steering</b> (EAS) was implemented with DSP. This study shows {{the usage of}} a dsPIC to control the BLDC motor with an encoder. The BLDC motor here is driven by dsPIC through a three phase inverter system. IRAMS type of inverter is used which is cost efficient and space efficient. The dsPIC supplied with the input of the steering. In its higher capacity the vehicles speed controller acts as the assistance level controller for steering effort. At the lower capacity, the torque controller gives the effort level control. In reality this can be realized as torque sensor and vehicle sensor interfaced in the dsPIC. For actual implementation in the system, a dsPIC-based BLDC motor controller with three-phase inverter module is used with Hall-effect sensor feedback. It is designed {{in such a way}} that the driver assistance can be varied at any time without any difficulty...|$|R

50|$|The Legacy {{began with}} a four-door sedan or five-door wagon body styles with FWD and an {{optional}} full-time AWD package, and {{was introduced in the}} United States, UK, Germany, the Benelux region of Northern Europe, Argentina, Chile, Japan, Australia it was called Liberty and New Zealand. The car was built with many luxury and technological advancements normally found on more expensive vehicles as standard equipment, such as power windows, central locking, fuel injection, air conditioning, vehicle speed sensitive, variable effort, <b>power</b> <b>assist</b> rack-and-pinion <b>steering,</b> alloy wheels, 4-wheel independent suspension (MacPherson struts in front and Chapman struts for the back) with both negative scrub and anti-dive and squat geometery, anti-sway bars front and rear, and all-wheel disc brakes. Items that were optional that didn't make the vehicle too expensive were four-channel ABS, licensed from Bosch and air suspension height control, which lowered the vehicle at speeds above 50 mi/h km/h, and also allowed the driver to increase the vehicles ground clearance for off-road conditions. In many markets, only four-wheel-drive models were sold, or a very limited front-wheel-drive lineup.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} a 6,230 cc 90-degree V8 with twin SU carburetors, coupled to a 4-speed {{automatic}} transmission. The car had massive drum brakes and a wheelbase of 3,683 mm. Four speed automatic transmission and <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> were standard.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "t" [...] {{was home}} to other Ferrari firsts: It used <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> {{for the first time}} and had a 3-position {{electronically}} controlled suspension for a variable tradeoff between ride quality and road holding. It also had standard ABS.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Power</b> <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> (set on {{most modern}} cars) make the torque steer effect less {{noticeable}} to the driver. Steer-by-wire also hides {{the effect of}} torque steer from the driver. EPAS can be calibrated to directly suppress the torque effect at the handwheel, and the steer effect on the vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|From mid-1991 {{the cars}} became {{available}} with a 3.8 litre V6 engine with [...] originating with General Motors' [...] "Holden" [...] subsidiary in South Australia. This largely replaced the earlier Commodore, which, unlike its German counterparts {{had continued to}} be available after the mid-life facelift. The Commodore was only available with the fuel injected 30E engine. The 3.8 liter Rekord 380i GSi had an advertised top speed of 211 km/h, making it substantially faster than any listed Opel Rekord from the factory in Germany, while the automatic-only CD model could reach 202 km/h. On the other hand, the CD reached 100 km/h faster, {{as a result of}} being able to reach the ton in second gear. In addition to a full equipment (slightly less ample for the sportier GSi), the Rekord 380i also received the Omega's independent rear suspension and <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> rack-and-pinion <b>steering</b> to help handle the extra power. The interior was upgraded with a new dash and a sporty steering wheels and seats, while the exterior received ten-spoke alloy wheels and a rear spoiler.|$|R
50|$|The Didgori is {{assembled}} on {{and around}} the chassis of US Ford Super Duty F-550 heavy duty pickup trucks with V8 Power Stroke Turbo Diesel engines and <b>power</b> <b>assisted</b> hydraulic <b>steering.</b> The product basis choice has proven very effective during trials and in the field on various types of terrain.The max. speed on paved roads is 120-140 km/h and reduced to 80 km/h on terrain. Acceleration from 0-100 km/h is achieved in 22 seconds. The cruising range at 60 km/h is 500 km. Each unit {{has at least one}} 20 litre fuel can in reserve. The vehicle can operate at temperatures ranging from -32° to +55° and remains unaffected by heavy meteorological conditions. The wheels consist of Hutchinson 12r20 mpt80 type tyres which have a run flat capability of 50 km at 50 km/h. The Didgori has 400 mm ground clearance and is able to climb slopes at a 60% gradient and drive sideways along a slope at a 40% gradient. The vehicle base version is not amphibious - although such a variant is an option, but can move in up to 1 m deep water.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} high towing {{capability}} came all-new steering, braking and electronic systems to help the Expedition better control and maneuver long heavy trailers. Adaptive variable <b>assist</b> <b>power</b> rack-and-pinion <b>steering</b> was introduced along with the largest brake rotors in the segment at that time (13.5 inches up front, 13 inches in back) with brake calipers 100 percent stiffer than the previous generation Expedition. The four-speed 4R70W automatic transmission received all-new control software to allow the transmission to automatically adjust {{to the demands of}} towing, using new computer logic that recognizes changes in load and road conditions.|$|R
