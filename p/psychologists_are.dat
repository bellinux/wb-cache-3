25|$|In {{addition}} to therapy, clinical <b>psychologists</b> <b>are</b> also trained to administer and interpret psychological personality tests {{such as the}} MMPI and the Rorschach inkblot test, and various standardized tests of intelligence, memory, and neuropsychological functioning. Common areas of specialization include: specific disorders (e.g. trauma), neuropsychological disorders, child and adolescent, family and relationship counseling. Internationally, <b>psychologists</b> <b>are</b> generally not granted prescription privileges. In the US, prescriptive rights have been granted to appropriately trained psychologists only in the states of New Mexico and Louisiana, with some limited prescriptive rights in Indiana and the US territory of Guam.|$|E

25|$|Although {{school psychologists}} {{understand}} that schools {{are important in}} the lives of young people, not all school <b>psychologists</b> <b>are</b> employed in schools. Many school psychologists, particularly those with doctoral degrees, practice in other settings, including clinics, hospitals, forensic settings, correctional facilities, universities, and independent practice (ABPP, n.d.).|$|E
25|$|I/O <b>psychologists</b> <b>are</b> {{concerned}} with the related topics of workplace bullying, aggression, and violence. For example, I/O research found that exposure to workplace violence elicited ruminative thinking, and ruminative thinking, in turn, is associated with poor well-being. I/O {{research has found that}} interpersonal aggressive behaviours is associated with worse team performance.|$|E
25|$|I/O <b>psychologists</b> <b>are</b> {{concerned}} with occupational health and well-being.

25|$|Health {{psychology}} also concerns {{itself with}} bettering {{the lives of}} individuals with terminal illness.

Health <b>psychologists</b> <b>are</b> also concerned with providing therapeutic services for the bereaved.|$|E
25|$|As {{described}} above, I/O <b>psychologists</b> <b>are</b> {{trained in}} the scientist–practitioner model.

25|$|Employment {{for psychologists}} in the United States is {{expected}} to grow faster than most occupations through the year 2014, with anticipated growth of 18–26%. One in four <b>psychologists</b> <b>are</b> employed in educational settings. In the United States, the median salary for psychologists in primary and secondary schools is US$58,360 as of May 2004.

25|$|Counseling psychologists {{study and}} use {{many of the}} same {{interventions}} and tools as clinical psychologists, including psychotherapy and assessment. Traditionally, counseling psychologists help people with what might be considered normal or moderate psychological problems—such as the feelings of anxiety or sadness resulting from major life changes or events. Many counseling psychologists also receive specialized training in career assessment, group therapy, and relationship counseling, although some counseling psychologists also work with the more serious problems that clinical <b>psychologists</b> <b>are</b> trained for, such as dementia or psychosis.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{observation}} – Clinical <b>psychologists</b> <b>are</b> also {{trained to}} gather data by observing behavior. The clinical interview is {{a vital part of}} assessment, even when using other formalized tools, which can employ either a structured or unstructured format. Such assessment looks at certain areas, such as general appearance and behavior, mood and affect, perception, comprehension, orientation, insight, memory, and content of communication. One psychiatric example of a formal interview is the mental status examination, which is often used in psychiatry as a screening tool for treatment or further testing.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} couple of decades, there has been a growing {{movement}} to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of cultural, gender, spiritual, and sexual-orientation issues. Clinical <b>psychologists</b> <b>are</b> beginning to look at the various strengths and weaknesses of each orientation while also working with related fields, such as neuroscience, behavioral genetics, evolutionary biology, and psychopharmacology. The result is a growing practice of eclecticism, with psychologists learning various systems and the most efficacious methods of therapy with the intent to provide the best solution for any given problem.|$|E
50|$|The first {{committee}} on Ethical Standards for <b>Psychologists</b> <b>was</b> developed in 1947 and chaired by Edward Tolman. The committee <b>was</b> created because <b>psychologists</b> <b>were</b> becoming {{more involved in}} professional activities and public works during and following World War II. To gain insight on what to include, the committee sought information from psychologists in the field. Psychologists discussed situations in which they felt they encountered ethical dilemmas.|$|R

25|$|Among current {{educational}} psychologists, {{the cognitive}} perspective is more widely held than the behavioral perspective, {{perhaps because it}} admits causally related mental constructs such as traits, beliefs, memories, motivations and emotions. Cognitive theories claim that memory structures determine how information is perceived, processed, stored, retrieved and forgotten. Among the memory structures theorized by cognitive <b>psychologists</b> <b>are</b> separate but linked visual and verbal systems described by Allan Paivio's dual coding theory. Educational psychologists have used dual coding theory and cognitive load theory to explain how people learn from multimedia presentations.|$|E
25|$|Health psychologists help {{to promote}} health and {{well-being}} by preventing illness. Some illnesses can be more effectively treated if caught early. Health psychologists have worked to understand why some people do not seek early screenings or immunizations, and have used that knowledge to develop ways {{to encourage people to}} have early health checks for illnesses such as cancer and heart disease. Health <b>psychologists</b> <b>are</b> also finding ways to help people to avoid risky behaviors (e.g., engaging in unprotected sex) and encourage health-enhancing behaviors (e.g., regular tooth brushing or hand washing).|$|E
25|$|School {{psychology}} {{is a field}} that applies principles of educational psychology, developmental psychology, clinical psychology, community psychology, and applied behavior analysis to meet children's and adolescents' behavioral health and learning needs in a collaborative manner with educators and parents. School <b>psychologists</b> <b>are</b> educated in psychology, child and adolescent development, child and adolescent psychopathology, education, family and parenting practices, learning theories, and personality theories. They are knowledgeable about effective instruction and effective schools. They are trained to carry out psychological testing and psychoeducational assessment, counseling, and consultation, and in the ethical, legal and administrative codes of their profession.|$|E
40|$|To {{compare the}} work {{practices}} and training needs of {{rural and urban}} <b>psychologists,</b> 774 surveys <b>were</b> sent to <b>psychologists</b> throughout Australia. The <b>psychologists</b> <b>were</b> selected from the Australian Psychological Society (APS) Directory of Psychologists, 1992 - 1993. A total of 86 rural psychologists and 282 urban psychologists responded to the survey. The survey comprised of four sections with questions asking respondents their demographic and employment background, past and current training activities, work experience, and relations with community. Results showed {{that the decision to}} practice and remain in a rural area was influenced by psychologists’ childhood experience and professional training in a rural setting, A substantial proportion of rural psychologists (28 %) had been working in rural practice for five years or less. These rural <b>psychologists</b> <b>were</b> identified as a group that had a demographic and training profile more similar to urban psychologists than their rural colleagues. The employment conditions and training background of rural and urban <b>psychologists</b> <b>were</b> similar, though rural <b>psychologists</b> <b>were</b> more likely to be working in private practice and have undertaken their studies in a rural setting. Rural and urban psychologists rated their undergraduate and postgraduate training in psychology as only somewhat adequate. Training in rural health and community issues received the lowest ratings from both groups of psychologists. The work practices of rural and urban <b>psychologists</b> <b>were</b> also similar. There were some differences in the demographic profile of the client groups seen by the two groups. Rural psychologists reported the type of relations with their communities that are conducive to rural practice. The main evidence of this <b>was</b> that rural <b>psychologists</b> <b>were</b> collaborating with the natural helpers of their communities, and expressed willingness to formally train natural helpers to assist in the provision of psychological services. There were several conclusions drawn from this study. The first conclusion <b>was</b> that rural <b>psychologists</b> with urban demographic and training backgrounds are a group that is likely to migrate from rural practice to urban practice, Secondly, training needs to be specialised for rural practice {{if there is to be}} an improvement in the number of psychologists practicing in rural settings. Thirdly, rural <b>psychologists</b> <b>were</b> conducting the type of relations with their communities that are important to the requirements of rural practice...|$|R
