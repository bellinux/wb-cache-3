5000|$|Former UDA {{commander}} Andy Tyrie {{alleged that}} he passed on {{information to the}} IRA regarding the movements of UDA South Belfast brigadier John McMichael to facilitate his assassination. The information was gleaned through conversations Hanna had with McMichael during the latter's visits to loyalist inmates. Hanna would then pass on the information regarding McMichael to Belfast Catholic actress Rosena Brown - dubbed the [...] "IRA Mata Hari" [...] - who was an IRA Intelligence officer with whom Hanna was deeply infatuated. Author Tony Geraghty, described Hanna, who was married with children, as a [...] "womaniser". Hanna himself later {{admitted that he had}} been dominated by [...] "a <b>Provie</b> woman". Rosena Brown was introduced to McMichael at his pub [...] "Admiral Benbow" [...] where she warned him that he was [...] "being watched".|$|E
5000|$|Sometime {{after her}} release from Armagh she became an IRA Intelligence Officer, and later {{received}} the nickname of the [...] "IRA Mata Hari" [...] by the media. She {{was described by}} journalist Mark Devenport as having been especially suited for intelligence work; in particular she was highly skilled at losing herself {{when members of the}} security forces were tailing her. She often used the Irish version of her name, Róisín De Brún. According to journalist Liam Clarke, Brown used a mixture of [...] "blackmail, political argument and seduction" [...] to inveigle John Hanna, a senior officer at the Maze Prison, into providing her with information on top loyalists and prison officer colleagues, which she then passed on to the IRA. This form of espionage is known as a [...] "honey trap". The Belfast Telegraph newspaper described Brown as [...] "one of the most famous 'honeys'". When she was with Hanna she used the name [...] "Ann Brown". Ulster Defence Association (UDA) leader Andy Tyrie suggested that Hanna gave Brown information regarding the movements of UDA South Belfast brigadier John McMichael which she then passed on to the IRA who subsequently assassinated him. Hanna, who was completely infatuated with Brown and later admitted that he was dominated by [...] "a <b>Provie</b> woman", obtained the information regarding McMichael during the latter's visits to loyalist inmates inside the Maze. Brown was personally introduced to McMichael at his pub the [...] "Admiral Benbow" [...] which he owned in his native Lisburn. She warned him that he was [...] "being watched". John McMichael was killed on 22 December 1987 when a booby-trap bomb exploded underneath his car in his driveway. The IRA unit which planted the bomb was led by Sean Savage, who would later be gunned down by the SAS in Gibraltar in what became known as Operation Flavius. Neither Hanna nor Brown were ever charged with involvement in McMichael's murder. It is widely believed that he was set up by his UDA associates. Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) Chief Constable Sir John Hermon also suggested that this was the case. Racketeer and UDA [...] "fundraiser" [...] James Craig was shot dead inside an east Belfast pub by the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) for allegedly setting up McMichael's assassination by the IRA.|$|E
40|$|Tag {{elimination}} is {{a program}} transformation for removingu unecessary tagging and untagging operations from automatically generated programs. Tag elimination was recently proposed as having immediate applications in implementations of domain specific languages (where it can give a two-fold speedup), and may <b>provie</b> {{a solution to the}} long standing problem of Jones-optimal specialization in the typed setting. This paper explains in more detail the role of tag elimination in the implementation of domain-specific languages, presents a number of significant simplifications and a high-level, higer-order, typed self-applicable interpreter.

40|$|With {{a steady}} release of {{material}} into The National Archives (UK), scholarly interest in imperial and commonwealth history {{as well as}} the field of intelligence studies has grown. The Malayan Emergency continues to <b>provie</b> a wealth of material, particularly for those interested in counter-insurgency. Yet the colonial police, and by extension their intelligence branches, have received less attention. This article considers new evidence of the organizational changes that occurred and the discussions that took place between the Colonial Office, the Malayan Government, the Malayan Police and the wider intelligence community which led to a restructuring of the Malayan Police and its Special Branch. It charts the rise of the Malayan Police Special Branch during {{the early stages of the}} emergency and its disentanglement from CID, reflecting on how police reform was shaped as much by external agencies as by local considerations...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment is impossible, due to widespread acceptance of an impossibility proof that utilizes quantum entaglement cheating. In this paper, we delineate how the impossibiliy proof formulation misses {{various types of}} quantum bit commitment protocols based on two-way quantum communications. We point {{out some of the}} gaps in the impossibility proof reasoning, and present corresponding counterexamples. Four different types of bit commitment protocols are constructed with several new protocol techniques. A specific Type 4 protocol is described and proved unconditionally secure. Security analysis of a Type 1 protocol and a Type 2 protocol are also sketched. The security of Type 3 protocols is as yet open. A development of quantum statistical decision theory and quantum games is needed to <b>provie</b> a complete security analysis of many such protocols.

40|$|Electrical & Computer Engineering ii Co-channel speech {{occurs when}} one speaker’s speech is {{corrupted}} by another speaker’s speech. A co-channel detection system could <b>provie</b> information to suspend the operation of a speech processing system whose operation would be degraded if it were processing co- hannel speech. Two new methods of co-channel speech detection, one based on cyclostationarity and the other based on wavelet transform are developed. Detection of co- hannel speech in this thesis refers to the detection of co-chan el voiced speech, as {{it is not possible}} to detect unvoiced co-channel speech. Cyclostationarity based co-channel speech detection reveals that at least 60 % of co-channel speech is correctly detected for different combinations of speech, e. g., male-male female-f male etc., with false alarms of approximately 16 %. Investigation of the wavelet transform based co-channel speech detection reveals that at least 94 % of co-channel speech is correctly detected with false alarms of approximately 28 % making both methods tools fo...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of emerging contaminants (ECs; pharmaceuticals, {{personal care products}} and illicit drugs) in the environment has been given much attention over recent years. Our current study is investigating the presence and fate of ECs in wastewaters and the environment within a river catchment in South-West England. An integrated analytical approach of targeted (> 200 compounds including metabolites) and non-targeted screening, chiral analysis and solids analysis will <b>provie</b> a holistic overview of EC distribution and behaviour throughout the catchment. Wastewater treatment works for monitoring have been selected to cover > 70 % of the population. A minimum of five sampling points per site will be investigated (influent wastewater, effluent wastewater, biomass/sludge, and river water upstream and down stream of the effluent discharge point. Monitoring involves eight (consecutive) day sampling campaigns utilising composite samplers. This approach will provide {{one of the most}} comprehensive investigations of ECs in the environment to date. Initial findings have shown the ubiquity of ECs in wastewaters. Weekly profiles of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and suspected endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in influent wastewater show little inter-day variation. This is to be expected through their continual use. A similar trend was observed for the stimulants amphetamine and methamphetamine. In contrast, cocaine and benzoylecgonine and MDMA demonstrated significantly higher concentrations during weekends due to their recreational use. Interestingly, a similar trend was observed for MDMA in effluent. In effluent, MDA was also observed showing a similar trend to the parent compound MDMA. This demonstrates the necessity of analysing metabolites for fate evaluation and the development of more accurate risk assesment. The catchment approach described here provides the opportunity to produce a comprehensive data-set of ECs in wastewater and the environment. This data will be used to, but not limited to, provide a better understanding of EC fate and behaviour during wastewater treatment and in the environment (in both aqueous and terrestrial compartments), detailed wastewater based epidemiology of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs, and the development of more accurate environmental risk assessment...|$|E
