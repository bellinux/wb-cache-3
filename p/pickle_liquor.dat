In the pickling solution feed, other metallic ions are typically present besides iron (mainly Fe 2 +) such as zinc(II).

Moreover, zinc recovery is economically affordable because it allows the marketing of some products such as ZnCl 2 and ZnSO 4. In the present work, liquid-liquid extraction process has been selected to recover zinc(II) from <b>pickling</b> <b>liquors,</b> using suitable extractant agents. Co-extraction of other metals has also been considered, thus several extraction steps have been performed to regenerate the extractant besides to extract zinc.

In fact, in these processes, iron chlorides are converted into iron oxides and hydrogen chloride at high temperature in spray roasting or fluidized bed reactors. Though the state-of-the-art technologies have been successfully applied only to large-scale plants, the development of small-scale units, able to perform a delocalized regeneration of spent solutions where these latter are actually produced, would be strongly needed in order to minimize the transportation of hazardous spent pickling and fresh HCl solutions to/from pickling factories from/to large centralized regeneration plants. In the present work, a steady-state simulation model for regeneration of spent <b>pickling</b> <b>liquor</b> via spray roasting has been developed, aiming at the analysis of performance of a small-scale unit. The simulation and optimization of the process has been carried out using Aspen Plus simulator.

Solid recovery from roaster off-gases has been obtained by a cyclone and a Venturi scrubber, where the spent <b>pickling</b> <b>liquor</b> is concentrated prior to be sprayed into the reactor. Hydrogen chloride is absorbed in an adiabatic absorber, where a sub-azeotropic (18 – 20 wt%) hydrochloric solution is obtained.

The optimum conditions for preparing the composite coagulant with red mud and hydrochloric <b>pickle</b> <b>liquor</b> of bauxite were studied. The effect of {{various factors such as}} pH. ionic strength and water temperature on performance of the prepared coagulant was investigated. The coagulation performance of the composite coagulant by treating biologically pre-treated municipal sewage and eutrophic water was evaluated. The leaching potential of heavy metals from the coagulant was also investigated. The results showed that the prepared coagulant could reduce the phosphate in values lower than 0. 02 mg/L Compared with commercial polyaluminum chloride coagulant (PACl), it could promote phosphate removal efficiency from 4. 9 % to 10. 4 %. Overall, it is suggested that the composite coagulant is an efficient coagulant and it can be possibly considered as a promising option for tertiary treatment of wastewaters and removing nutrients in eutrophic water, especially for the removal of phosphate.

However, co-hydrothermal {{treatment of}} the electroplating sludge and the spent <b>pickle</b> <b>liquor</b> in a suitable mixing ratio results in a well crystallized ferrite product, with all heavy metals being fixed into the ferrite lattice. In order for the ferrite product to have a maximum saturation magnetization (41. 42 emu g(- 1) in this research), the response surface methodology (RSM) has been employed to derive the optimal experiment condition, e. g. hydrothermal treatment at 300 degrees C for 6 h with the initial pH adjusted to 10.

In addition, the magnetization of ferrite products can be further enhanced to 58. 34 emu g(- 1) by acid washing to remove the impurity (calcite).

40|$|Industrial {{experience}} {{has revealed that}} when used to treat multi-component metal chloride waste liquors, existing fluidized bed acid regeneration facilities are not as efficient as when employed for the pyrohydrolysis of conventional iron chloride solutions (i. e. waste <b>pickle</b> <b>liquor).</b> As a result, experimental studies and thermochemical modelling were performed to characterize the transformation of a saturated Al-Fe-Mg-Cl solution at 105 °C, after it is injected into a reactor at 850 °C. Efforts were geared toward defining the sequence of reactions that take place as the liquor gradually transforms into oxides. C, after it is injected into a reactor at 850 °C.

Efforts were geared toward defining the sequence of reactions that take place as the liquor gradually transforms into oxides. C, after it is injected into a reactor at 850 °C. Efforts were geared toward defining the sequence of reactions that take place as the liquor gradually transforms into oxides. Upon completing a comprehensive literature review, testwork was initially performed with a simplified experimental set-up to study the physical behaviour of the chloride solution as it is exposed to a static bed of oxides at 850 °C, and ultimately identify the various phases of the transformation process. Subsequently, controlled evaporative crystallization experiments were conducted under pseudo-equilibrium conditions to define the McClx·yH 2 O precipitation path that takes place during the H 2 O evaporation phase and {{to determine whether the}} chlorides precipitate independently or as complex compounds. Further experiments were performed in a fully instrumented tube furnace to elaborate {{on the nature of the}} reactions (dehydration and/or pyrohydrolysis) that take place after all of the water in the starting solution has evaporated (i. e. T= 300 °C+). In an effort to assist with the interpretation of the experimental results, thermochemical modelling was performed to predict the equilibrium phase assemblages that could occur during the transformation of the saturated Al-Fe-Mg-Cl solution, at reaction temperatures of 200 °C+. The research study at hand has shown that when the saturated Al-Fe-Mg-Cl solution at 105 °C is exposed to fluidized bed pyrohydrolyzer operating conditions at 850 °C, the following sequence of events take place: (1) rapid solvent H 2 O evaporation (i. e. vigorous boiling) and onset of solid metal chloride precipitation. (2) slurry densification due to a gradual increase in crystal content (i. e. AlCl· 6 H 2 O, FeCl 2 ·xH 2 O, and MgCl 2 ·xH 2 O, where x = 2 or 4). (3) hydrated crystal drying and onset of pyrohydrolysis (i. e. thermal decomposition of McClx·yH 2 O). The same holds true for the high temperature hydrolysis of typical waste pickle liquors (i. e. primarily FeCl 2 solution). The crystallization studies revealed that when the Al-Fe-Mg-Cl solution is allowed to gradually evaporate at 105 °C,. AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O precipitates when 15 % of the solvent water evolves from the liquor, followed by FeCl 2 ·xH 2 O and MgCl 2 ·xH 2 O (where x = 2 or 4) at 26 and 41 % evaporation, respectively. Ferric chloride remains in solution even after 54 % of the water has been driven from the liquor. The latter result suggests that higher ferric concentrations in the reactor feed are more than likely to favour an increase in the quantity of liquor entrainment by the fluidizing gases and therefore lead to lower process efficiencies. Dedicated pyrohydrolysis experiments, with a simulated reactor atmosphere (gaseous, not dynamic), have shown that excluding kinetic effects, the transformation of the Al-Fe-Mg-Cl solution occurs primarily over the 300 to 600 °C temperature range. Thermochemical modelling revealed that with the exception of AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O hydrolysis, the majority of the reactions taking place as the saturated Al-Fe-Mg-Cl liquor is introduced into and eventually reaches 850 °C are governed by either reaction kinetics or diffusion. Furthermore, the resulting phase assemblage at any given temperature was predicted to vary significantly with oxygen potential. A liquid chloride phase (including molten salt), other than the feed liquor, was not predicted to form at any temperature (i. e. 200 °C or above) under the range of oxidizing or reducing conditions considered. The findings of this research were quite useful in identifying the means for improving the performance of a commercial fluidized bed pyrohydrolyzer for a spent chloride liquor containing the said species...|$|E
40|$|In many {{industrial}} processes {{the presence of}} zinc in the wastewater may represent an obstacle to its high efficient regeneration.

Hydrochloric spent pickling solutions from steel processing contain relevant amount of metals such as iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) that may significantly affect recovery of hydrochloric acid (HCl) through pyrohydrolysis. In fact, although Fe may be recovered as ferric oxide (Fe 2 O 3) and does not have a substantial effect on pyrohydrolysis process, zinc chloride (ZnCl 2) evaporating can occlude nozzles and stick to the pyrohydrolysis reactor walls, thereby contaminating the iron oxide product.
