He wakes up and goes to Mostow's studio again, finding a severed arm. Scully gets a message to call Nemhauser, but his <b>phone</b> <b>is</b> answered by Mulder, who denies taking the knife. Mulder searches Mostow's studio and finds Nemhauser's body inside a new sculpture. Mulder is then confronted by Patterson, who is unaware of how {{he arrived at the}} studio. Mulder then deduces that Patterson is the killer, based on his three-year obsession with Mostow and his request for Mulder to investigate the case.

The SS-66K is a self-contained phone, but features a rather unusual ball antenna.|$|E
25|$|On July 21, 2016, Snowden and {{hardware}} hacker Bunnie Huang, in a talk at MIT Media Lab's Forbidden Research event, published research for a smartphone case, the so-called Introspection Engine, that would monitor signals received and sent by that phone {{to provide an}} alert to the user if their <b>phone</b> <b>is</b> transmitting or receiving information when it shouldn't be (for example when it's turned off or in airplane mode), a feature described by Snowden to be useful for journalists or activists operating under hostile governments that would otherwise track their activities through their phones.|$|E
25|$|Since November 2012, in monetizing its app, Waze {{has offered}} resellers and {{advertisers}} a web interface to advertise based on location, {{where a small}} icon appears when a <b>phone</b> <b>is</b> at a particular location, prompting the user to engage.

Madison finds Greenlee's bouquet, and Greenlee catches her with it. Madison rushes off, leaving her phone behind. When Emma, Spike, and Ryan arrive, Madison finds out her <b>phone</b> <b>is</b> gone. She calls it using Scott's phone and Emma picks up. Madison reluctantly comes to get the phone and starts to have cramps while she's there. Ryan tries to help her and asks her what's wrong. She {{says that it is}} too soon; when Ryan asks questions what is too soon, Greenlee sees her and blurts out that Madison's pregnant. The information shocks Ryan.|$|E
25|$|A mobile phone, or cell <b>phone,</b> <b>is</b> a long-range, {{electronic}} device used for mobile voice or data communication over {{a network of}} specialized base stations known as cell sites. Early mobile FM radio telephones were in use for many years, but since the number of radio frequencies were very limited in any area, the number of phone calls were also very limited. To solve this problem, there could be many small areas called cells which share the same frequencies. When users moved from one area to another while calling, the call {{would have to be}} switched over automatically without losing the call. In this system, a small number of radio frequencies could accommodate a huge number of calls. The first mobile call was made from a car phone in St. Louis, Missouri on June 17, 1946, but the system was impractical from what is considered a portable handset today. The equipment weighed 80lbs, and the AT service, basically a massive party line, cost $30 per month plus 30 to 40 cents per local call. The basic network and supporting infrastructure of hexagonal cells used to support a mobile telephony system while remaining on the same channel were devised by Douglas H. Ring and W. Rae Young at AT Bell Labs in 1947. Finally in 1973, Martin Cooper invented the first handheld cellular/mobile phone. His first mobile phone call was made to Joel S. Engel in April 1973.|$|E
500|$|It was {{reported}} that the optical image stabilization systems on some iPhone 6 Plus models were faulty, failing to properly stabilize when the <b>phone</b> <b>is</b> being held perfectly still, leading to blurry photos and [...] "wavy"-looking videos. The optical image stabilization system was also found to {{have been affected by}} accessories that use magnets, such as third-party lens attachments; Apple issued advisories to users and its licensed accessory makers, warning that magnetic or metallic accessories can cause the OIS to malfunction.|$|E
50|$|In addition, BRAVIA brand <b>phones</b> have <b>been</b> {{produced}} by Sony/Sony Ericsson. BRAVIA brand <b>phones</b> <b>are</b> {{able to watch}} 1seg terrestrial television.|$|R
50|$|When {{one of the}} tapped phones made or {{received}} a phone call, the exchange, or switch, sent a duplication of the conversation to one of fourteen anonymous prepaid mobile phones. As these <b>phones</b> <b>are</b> not associated with a contract, retrieving details of their owners is very difficult. About half of the intercepting <b>phones</b> <b>were</b> activated between June and August 2004. The base stations that serviced those <b>phones</b> <b>were</b> in an area {{near the center of}} Athens.|$|R
5000|$|The Profile 300e had an LED Display with 3 signal icons, 3 battery icons, an NS icon (No Service), an IU icon (In Use), and RM (Roaming). It had a 10-number display. When the <b>phone</b> <b>was</b> turned on, {{the screen}} would simply say [...] "On". If the <b>phone</b> <b>was</b> locked it would say [...] "Loc'd". When the <b>phone</b> <b>was</b> locked, the code was a 3-digit number—by default 1-2-3, or if not, {{the last three}} digits in the phone's number.|$|R
500|$|The G2's {{exterior}} {{consists of}} a polycarbonate shell—unlike its predecessor, which used a glass-based construction. The rear cover is adorned with a subtle pattern resembling carbon fiber. The G2's volume and power keys are located directly below the camera on {{the rear of the}} device. The power button contains an LED lamp, which {{can be used as a}} notification light. The positioning of the buttons on the rear deviates from the majority of smartphones, where they are located on the bezel (side edge) of the phone. LG argued that buttons located on the bezel were harder to reach on larger smartphones, and made it more likely for users to drop their phone when adjusting the volume during a call. As such, the G2's buttons are instead located where the index finger would normally lie when the <b>phone</b> <b>is</b> held. Alongside the power button, the G2 is also [...] powered on by double-tapping on the screen, and turned off by double-tapping on the status bar or a blank area on the home screen, a feature branded as [...] "KnockOn". When the <b>phone</b> <b>is</b> off, the volume keys can also be used to launch directly into the camera or QuickMemo applications by holding them down.|$|E
500|$|The game uses an ad-hoc online {{multiplayer}} {{feature that}} enables various actions between players, including trading Materia via email. Players can summon {{a friend to}} cast magic by filling the [...] "Materia aid" [...] meter. Up to three players can team up at any one time. [...] "Rescue Mode" [...] is activated if the player is defeated during [...] "Episode Mode", at which point they {{have the option to}} restart and lose points, or allow themselves to be imprisoned and wait for other players to rescue them. The player can be rescued while their <b>phone</b> <b>is</b> powered down.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics {{begin with}} a promise of {{protection}} and caretaking: [...] "You'll be given love / You'll {{be taken care of}} / You'll have to trust it". The song moves towards a more reproachful tone as Björk sings, [...] "You just ain't receiving / Your <b>phone</b> <b>is</b> off the hook / Your doors are shut", tempered by the recognition that you have to [...] "twist your head around you" [...] because [...] "love is all around you". This is musically effected by Björk's vocals as she sings the lyric [...] "All is full of love" [...] in counterpoint with herself.|$|E
5000|$|On October 11, in an {{official}} statement, Dell announced the <b>phone</b> to <b>be</b> available in the U.S. in holiday season of 2010. On November 8, Windows <b>Phone</b> <b>was</b> launched, and a very limited quantity of Venue Pros were available for purchase only in the seven Microsoft stores in the U.S. However, some early adopters of the phone received defective phones with Wi-Fi issues, SIM card issues, faulty headphone jack, and batteries marked as [...] "Engineering Sample". Despite Dell urging users to return the <b>phones,</b> no <b>phones</b> <b>were</b> available in stock for exchange, and <b>phones</b> <b>were</b> not reshipped on November 19 as claimed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>phone</b> <b>was</b> {{withdrawn}} from sale in November 2009 by two major British retailers due to complaints from customers. However, {{the problem was}} found only in UK editions of the <b>phone</b> and <b>was</b> probably caused by carrier-specific customizations. The following software update released by Sony Ericsson provided a fix and the <b>phone</b> <b>was</b> back for sale at those two retailers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>phones</b> <b>are</b> now discontinued.|$|R
