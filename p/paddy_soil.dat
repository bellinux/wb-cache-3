Results and discussion Soil N content was obviously greater in the buried Neolithic <b>paddy</b> <b>soils</b> than in the parent material. Total soil N increased with increasing phytolith from 5, 200 to 60, 000 pellets g- 1, but tended to decrease with increasing phytolith from 60, 000 to 105, 000 pellets g- 1. A possible reason for RCI-induced increase of soil N was due to biological N 2 fixation in the rice field {{because there was a}} significant negative relationship between total N and d 15 N in the buried Neolithic soils. The mineralization rate constant (k) ranged from 0. 0126 to 0. 0485 d- 1 with an average of 0. 0276 d- 1, which was {{similar to that of the}} parent material, but lower than those in the present <b>paddy</b> <b>soils.</b> The k value increased with increasing RCI in the Neolithic <b>paddy</b> <b>soils.</b> There was a significant positive relation between RCI and the percentage of cumulative mineralizable N in the 14 d of that within 103 d incubation. Conclusions Soil N content tended to increase with the increasing intensity of rice cropping and then decreased under the high intensity of rice cropping; the excessive high intensification of rice cropping could facilitate fast N mineralization (labile N) fraction in the cumulated mineralized N. The unfertilized paddy field could only meet soil N supply under the low intensification of cropping rice in the Neolithic Age. The N fertilization is necessary in order to improve soil fertility for sustaining the present high-yield rice production. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHigh {{concentrations}} of salt (NaCl) in soils reduce plant growth and have enormous influence on nitrogen dynamics {{in the soil}} solution. However, addition of rice straw is expected {{to mitigate the effect}} of salinity on nitrogen cycling, therefore positively influencing plant growth. This study describes how rice seedling emergence and early growth in a saline <b>paddy</b> <b>soil</b> can be improved by adding rice straw to the soil and incubating the soil/straw mixtures for two months. I conducted a short-term laboratory incubation and a plant growth experiment to evaluate the benefit of rice straw addition to a saline <b>paddy</b> <b>soil</b> with respect to nitrogen availability and the associated growth response of saline tolerant (BRRI Dhan 47) and saline sensitive (BRRI Dhan 28) rice seedlings. A naturally saline <b>paddy</b> <b>soil</b> was collected from the coastal area of Bangladesh. The soil was then incubated with rice straw (0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 100 %, and 200 % of the straw yield) for two months. After that, BRRI Dhan 47 and BRRI Dhan 28 rice varieties were sown in these incubated soils. Rice seedlings were harvested after 14 days of sowing. My results indicated that raw rice straw addition to saline <b>paddy</b> <b>soil</b> decreased the bio-availability of salt. Furthermore, BRRI Dhan 28 responded better than the BRRI Dhan 47 to increased addition of rice straw to soil. Bulk soil pH declined and nitrogen availability increased with increasing rice straw in addition to saline <b>paddy</b> <b>soil.</b> This study concluded that rice straw can be a meaningful soil amendment to decrease harmful effect of salt and increase nitrogen availability in a saline <b>paddy</b> <b>soil...</b>|$|E

40|$|Rice can {{accumulate}} arsenic (As) {{to relatively}} high concentrations {{due to the}} general flooding practices in rice cultivation, and organic matter in the soil strongly affected As bioavailability to rice plants. The influence of organic matter input on the As transformation in <b>paddy</b> <b>soil</b> and As uptake into rice plants {{is an area that}} is rarely investigated. Biogas slurry (BGS), a commonly used organic fertilizer, was applied to an As contaminated <b>paddy</b> <b>soil,</b> in order to investigate the influence of organic matter on As transformation in the <b>paddy</b> <b>soil</b> and As accumulation in rice plants. Application of BGS significantly increased the As accumulation in rice plants, especially for methylated As species. Results showed that the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved Fe(II) in the soil solution were significantly increased by the BGS addition into the <b>paddy</b> <b>soil,</b> and were significantly correlated to the As concentration in the soil solution (P < 0. 01). The increase of soil pH and the decrease of the soil redox potential (Eh) were observed as well. These alteration of soil characteristics elevated the As release from soil particles to the soil solution under the addition of BGS. The increased concentrations of dimethylarsinic acid (DMAs(V)) and monomethylarsonic acid (MMAs(V)) in the soil solution, and the volatilized As of trimethylarsine (TMAs) from the <b>paddy</b> <b>soil,</b> suggested that As methylation and volatilization in the soil were also enhanced by BGS addition. The concentrations of methylated As species in rice husks and grains were increased by 105. 8 - 105. 9 % and 99. 7 - 112. 2 %, respectively. These results suggested that the use of organic fertilizer, such as BGS in As-contaminated <b>paddy</b> <b>soil,</b> can significantly alter the behavior of As in soil-rice system and enhance As accumulation in rice plants and should therefore be avoided...|$|E

The levels of heavy metals and PCBs and their influence on the enzyme activity and microbial community of <b>paddy</b> <b>soils</b> obtained from the immediate vicinity of an e-waste workshop were investigated in the present study.

30|$|With {{the help}} of FTIR spectroscopy, {{we were able to}} {{effectively}} identify the variation on the functional groups representing molecular structure of Fe/Al-OC during the decomposition of maize straw in soil. The results of FTIR spectroscopy showed that proportion of polysaccharide-C decreased with time, but the phenol-C tended to increase with time. These results indicate that polysaccharide groups of Fe/Al-OC mainly contribute to the sequestration of Fe/Al-OC during the primary decomposition stage of maize straw, and the phenol group was stable in different genesis of <b>paddy</b> <b>soils.</b> Both of the polysaccharides and phenol groups were important to C sequestration in <b>paddy</b> <b>soils</b> and marsh soil.|$|R
