The involvement of SR-BI and CD 36 in carotenoids and retinol cellular uptake was investigated in Caco- 2 and human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell lines. The involvement of scavenger receptor class B type I (SCARB 1) and CD 36 genetic variants on plasma concentrations of <b>provitamin</b> A carotenoids was assessed by association studies in 3 independent populations.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityVitamin D {{deficiency}} is {{a pandemic}} {{that is now}} one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide. Vitamin D deficiency leads to reduced calcium absorption from our diet, which causes hyperparathyroidism. The increase in parathyroid hormone results in a defective mineralization of our skeleton, leading to the development of rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. It also increases bone reabsorption resulting in a decrease in bone mineral density. During the winter months there is decreased or complete absence of the production of vitamin D in the skin; therefore finding natural dietary sources of vitamin D becomes important. Some mushroom species exposed to ultraviolet radiation produce vitamin D 2 as well as vitamin D 4. The goal of this project was to use high performance liquid chromatography with a photodiode ultraviolet absorbance detector to identify which <b>provitamin</b> Ds and vitamin Ds were present in various edible mushrooms species including skiitake (Lentinus edodes), oyster (Pleurotus ostreatus), portabella (Agaricus bisporus), crimini (Agaricus bisporus), and white button (Agaricus bisporus); and the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast). <b>Provitamin</b> Ds and vitamin Ds from the mushroom powder (Monterey Mushroom), mushroom samples, and the yeast sample were extracted with methanol and run on a Zorbax CN column. All the <b>provitamin</b> D samples were analyzed with reverse phase HPLC on a Zorbax ODS column along with standards for <b>provitamin</b> D 2 (ergosterol), <b>provitamin</b> D 3 (7 -dehydrocholesterol), and <b>provitamin</b> D 4 (22, 23 -dihydroergosterol). The collected vitamin D samples were run on a Vydac C 18 column along with standards for vitamin D 2 (ergocalciferol), vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) and vitamin D 4. <b>Provitamin</b> D 4 and vitamin D 4 isolated and collected from the mushroom powder sample were used as standards. <b>Provitamin</b> D 4 was identified in every mushroom species as well as the yeast sample. Vitamin D 4 was identified in three of the UV irradiated mushroom species including; white button, shiitake and oyster, as well as the yeast sample. <b>Provitamin</b> D 3 was identified in a shiitake mushroom. The ultraviolet absorption spectra for compounds identified as vitamin D 2, vitamin D 4, <b>provitamin</b> D 2, <b>provitamin</b> D 3 and <b>provitamin</b> D 4 in all samples matched the UV absorption spectra of a 5, 6 -cis-triene of vitamin D and a 5, 7 -diene of <b>provitamin</b> D standards. These results demonstrate that in addition to vitamin D 2, some mushroom species and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can also produce vitamin D 4. In addition, shiitake mushrooms contain <b>provitamin</b> D 3, and thus has the ability to produce vitamin D 3 after exposure to UV radiation.

40|$|Biofortified crops {{as sources}} of vitamin A contain <b>provitamin</b> A carotenoids, which are a {{precursor}} of vitamin A, {{similar to those found}} in some plant foods like carrots, mangos, and papaya. Two important factors to consider in the <b>provitamin</b> A crops are retention and bioavailability. The bioavailability of the most common plant <b>provitamin</b> A (beta-carotene) varies widely in relation to the food crop, genotype, cooking method, individual genetic factors, and consumption of fat with the meal. Bioconversion of dietary beta-carotene to retinol across plant foods ranges from 3 to 28 : 1 by weight (1). Food carotenoid degradation displays exponential decay patterns during storage and varies with the food matrix, crop genotype, and form of storage. It increases directly with time and temperature during storage as well as with exposure to high temperature, light, acids, and oxygen during processing.

Two separate sets of 12 healthy men and women were recruited for 2 randomized, 2 -way crossover studies.

To solve this nutritional problem, {{it is important to}} promote the consumption of yellow/orange fruits or green leafy vegetables which are rich sources of <b>provitamin</b> A. In order to achieve this, the carotenoids content of seven fruits (Mango: Mangifera indica, papaya: Carica papaya...|$|R

40|$|Introduction and objectives: Vitamin A {{is found}} in the form of retinol, retinal, retinoic acid or esters in animal sources, while in plant sources, it {{is in the form of}} <b>provitamin</b> A. Conjugated double bonds of {{carotenoids}} absorb light and are responsible for the brilliant colours of fruits and vegetables ranging from the yellow, orange to red. Moreover, they protect cells from oxidation and cellular damages, preventing of major chronic diseases. The aim of the present work was to determine the <b>provitamin</b> A activity in twenty eight traditional foods from six Black Sea Area countries (Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russian Federation, Turkey and Ukraine). Method: Chromatographic separation was performed with a UPLC® BEH guard-column (2. 1 x 5 mm, 1. 7 µm particle size) and a UPLC® BEH analytical column (2. 1 x 50 mm, 1. 7 µm particle size). The mobile phases were a gradient of ultrapure water and acetonitrile/methanol (containing 0. 05 M ammonium acetate) /dichloromethane (75 : 20 : 5, v/v/v). The flow-rate was 0. 5 mL/min and carotenoids were monitored at 450 nm. The concentration of each carotenoid was expressed as µg per 100 g of edible portion. <b>Provitamin</b> A activity was expressed as µg of retinol equivalents (RE) or retinol activity equivalents (RAE) per 100 g of edible portion. Results: One RE is equivalent to 1 µg retinol or 6 µg β-carotene or 12 µg of other <b>provitamin</b> A carotenes whileone RAE is equivalent to 1 µg retinol, 2 µg β-carotene dissolved in oil, 12 µg β-carotene or 24 µg of other <b>provitamin</b> A carotenoids. From the 28 traditional foods analysed, 12 did not present any RE or RAE. All the foods of the oilseeds or oilseed products did not present <b>provitamin</b> A activity. The traditional food with highest <b>provitamin</b> A activity was plums jam (Romania), followed by kale soup (Turkey) and nettle sour soup (Romania). Conclusions: Although a great variability was found in the carotenoids content, some of the analysed traditional foods can be considered excellent sources of <b>provitamin</b> A. Due to the putative health benefits of these compounds, the consumption of those with higher <b>provitamin</b> A activity should be promoted.
