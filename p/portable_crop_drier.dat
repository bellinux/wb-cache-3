Solar drying system {{is one of the most}} promising applications of <b>crop</b> <b>drying.</b> However, there are problems associated with the intermittent natural of solar radiation and the low intensities of solar radiation. The problems can be remedied by the use of heat storage, auxiliary energy source, control system, larger surface collector and hybrid system. However, this will result in a high capital investment. Economic indicators such as cost ofmaintenance, payback period, internal rate of return can be used to calculate the economic of it application.

40|$|The green <b>crop</b> <b>drying</b> {{industry}} in Denmark uses Italian rye grass, clover, and alfalfa {{as raw materials}} {{for the production of}} green pellets. The green <b>crop</b> <b>drying</b> industry solves its energy economical problems by heating and pressing of the green <b>crop</b> before <b>drying.</b> The produced sidestream is called brown juice. Brown juice was shown to be an excellent medium for lactic acid fermentation. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the utilisation of brown juice in the production of polylactic acid, where wheat starch would be added to increase the lactic acid yield and, thus, the feasibility of the process. A number of amylolytic lactic acid bacteria have been identified, and in this work, six different strains were tested for their ability to produce alpha-amylase and to utilise all sugars with high lactic acid yield in a medium with a complex composition of free sugars (brown juice) and starch. Lactobacillus plantarum A 6 was the only strain that showed both a good lactic acid production and utilisation of starch in this medium.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a model for simulating increase in leaf area index (L) was evaluated for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars across environments (years and sites). Rate of L expansion just after emergence was assumed to depend on temperature. After a predefined L, Ls, expansion was assumed to increase in proportion to leaf dry weight increase that depended on intercepted radiation, henceforward: radiation-limited expansion. The Ls value at which the model performed best {{was considered to be}} the most realistic L at which expansion shifts from temperature to radiation-limitation. An Ls value of zero leads to solely radiation-limited expansion, whereas a value larger than maximum L leads to solely temperature-limited expansion. The criteria used to evaluate the model were constancy of calibrated model parameters across environments, and predictive ability. For potato and wheat, parameters were most robust across environments, when Ls was neither zero nor at maximum L. Model parameters did not vary with genotype. The model’s predictions were best at an Ls of 1. 0 for potato and 1. 5 for wheat. Using these Ls values, the coefficient of determination between observed and predicted values was 91 % for potato and 88 % for wheat. Sensitivity analysis revealed that smaller Ls values led to larger changes in rate of leaf area expansion and <b>crop</b> <b>dry</b> weight than larger values did. <b>Crop</b> <b>dry</b> weight was hardly affected by an increase in Ls.
