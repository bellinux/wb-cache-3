50|$|More broadly, flight-to-quality {{refers to}} a sudden shift in {{investment}} behaviors {{in a period of}} financial turmoil whereby investors seek to sell assets perceived as risky and instead purchase safe assets. A defining feature of flight-to-quality is insufficient risk-taking by investors. While excessive risk-taking can be a source of financial turmoil, insufficient risk-taking can severely disrupt credit and other financial markets during a financial turmoil.

40|$|The paper's {{thesis is}} that the US dollar, despite the {{inevitable}} erosion of market share that it will suffer {{at the hands of}} the euro, will remain the most important international currency. The transaction domain of an international currency depends on its ability to lower transaction costs relative to alternative currencies. The EMU financial markets will not be as integrated, and thus as liquid, as the US financial markets for quite some time, thus favoring the use of the dollar as a medium of exchange. Inertia and reputational considerations further favor the dollar. The future value of the exchange rate dollar-euro will depend on economic fundamentals more than on <b>portfolio</b> <b>shifts.</b> <b>Portfolio</b> <b>shifts</b> argue for an appreciation of the euro; but fundamentals can swamp the effects of <b>portfolio</b> <b>shifts.</b> Should the EMU fundamentals reflect the spirit of the Maastricht Treaty and the Growth and Stability Pact, the chances for a euro appreciation will increase.

In particular, feedback effects working through optimal contracts and effort levels imply that expected terminal wealth is nonlinear in initial wealth allocation. The optimal portfolio may involve very little diversification, despite projects that are highly symmetric in the underlying model. We also show that moral hazard in one of the projects need not imply lower allocation to that project. Expected returns are generally lower than under the first-best, but the optimal contract shifts more of the idiosyncratic risk in the hidden action project to the manager in charge of it. The minimum-variance position of the investor’s (net) terminal wealth would in most cases involve a <b>portfolio</b> <b>shift</b> towards the hidden action project, and there are plausible cases where this would dominate the overall effect on the second-best optimal portfolio when comparing with the first-best...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of productivity shocks on the current and future terms of trade and on output in a two country framework. An overlapping-generations model is used in which individuals allocate their savings between domestic and foreign capital assets according to their preferences for risk and return. Since production in both countries is specialized, changes its the terms of trade affect investment returns in both countries; rational expectations regarding such changes are assumed and {{a new approach to}} analyzing the comparative statics of rational expectations equilibria is developed. It is concluded that a temporary, positive productivity shock to the home country will cause the domestic terms of trade to depreciate initially and then to appreciate slowly back towards its trend level. The depreciation causes foreign output to fall below trend, and causes a symmetric rise in domestic output, via its effects on capital stocks. The impact of a permanent productivity shock differs, however. In this case investors will reallocate their portfolios and increase their holdings of domestic assets, which are expected to earn higher returns. If the <b>portfolio</b> <b>shifts</b> are strong enough, they cause the terms of trade to appreciate initially.

40|$|A simple {{portfolio}} {{model is}} used to investigate the effects of personal taxes on real investment incentives in a small open economy with large and small firms. When shares in large firms can be traded internationally and their rate of return is exogenously determined on international equity markets, a tax on the return on riskless bonds will induce a <b>portfolio</b> <b>shift</b> from bonds to shares in large firms. This shift reduces {{the impact of the}} bond tax on the required rate of return on shares in domestically owned small firms, provided that returns on shares in small and large firms are positively correlated. The total impact of the bond tax may even change from a negative to a counter-intuitive positive one if the “beta” between the returns on small and large firms is above unity. A personal tax on equity returns does in general have an ambiguous impact on the pre-tax rate of return requirement of domestically owned firms. An exogenous rate of return on large company shares is shown to enhance the possibility for the equity tax to reduce the required pre-tax rate of return in small domestic firms. A sufficient condition for a negative relationship is again that the “beta” between the returns in small and large firms is above unity.

40|$|Assuming that {{liquidity}} constraints {{exist in}} most developing countries, {{the majority of}} analysts believe that increasing real interest rates will raise the volume of lending and hence private investment. The author, focusing on the demand for capital goods, argues that the {{positive effect on the}} domestic credit market may be offset by the negative effect of a <b>portfolio</b> <b>shift</b> from capital goods and public bonds into monetary assets. The author also demonstrates that a policy of financial liberalization could increase the public sector's demand for domestic credit, thus limiting the funds available to the private sector. This crowdingout does not result from a change in the government's behavior but from a shift in the portfolio of private agents. Higher demand for bank deposits reduces the private sector's willingness to hold government bonds, so the public sector must finance a given budget deficit with more domestic credit. Simulations for Argentina for 1961 - 1982 suggest that the low response of private investors to changes in interest rate policy in those 20 years was attributable not to the low values of interest elasticities but to the interaction of the mechanisms allowed for in the model, which tends to neutralize the impact of such policies. The author concludes that the effect of changes in interest rate policy on the demand for capital goods is weak in Argentina and might affect the quality of private investment more than its quantity.

40|$|In {{a seminal}} article, Obstfeld (1994) showed that growth and welfare gains from {{international}} risk-sharing arise in a continuous-time stochastic AK model. More precisely, he proved that a <b>portfolio</b> <b>shift</b> from safe and low-return capital to riskier and high-return capital triggers an unambiguous increase in growth. In this note I stress necessary and sufficient conditions ensuring stochastic {{stability of the}} exponential balanced-growth path, {{an issue that has}} not been addressed by Obstfeld. Not surprisingly, stability requires the average of the wealth growth rate to be positive, which makes clear how mean growth should be defined. Differently, Obstfeld defines mean growth as the growth rate of average wealth, which is smaller than the mean growth rate of wealth under the maintained assumption that wealth is log-normally distributed, because the latter growth concept is risk-adjusted. The two notions of mean growth have very different comparative statics properties both for economies that hold some risk-free capital and for economies that fully specialize in risky capital. Different from Obstfeld’s results, international financial integration increases the stability-related mean growth rate for both complete and incomplete specialization, if risk aversion takes on moderate values and provided that the intertemporal substitution elasticity is smaller than one. Although the welfare computations presented by Obstfeld are preserved, because they ultimately depend on parameter values, this note shows that stochastic stability sheds new light on the mechanisms that trigger growth changes under financial integration and underlines the intuition behind them...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{establish}} an original database from fieldwork on microfinance institutions in Cameroon. Design/methodology/approach – The main method used for the research involved statistical analysis of an original survey data. The latter fieldwork analysis has enabled us to test the hypothesis of neoclassical and neo-structuralist economists advocating a significant relationship between microfinance savings and liberalised real bank deposit interest rates. Findings – The statistical analysis carried out indicated that microfinance savings are associated to variables other than the rate of interest. The failure of a liberalised interest rate policy to cause a significant <b>portfolio</b> <b>shift</b> from microfinance into the banking system does not support the interest responsiveness of savings as advocated by the McKinnon-Shaw school. This paper supports, therefore, the neo-structuralist analysis of financial development where microfinance institutions are an important structural feature of financial systems in many developing countries. Research limitations/implications – It would be interesting to extend statistical analysis undertaken in this paper to other African countries. Practical implications – The main policy issue affecting microfinance from the empirical analysis is the need to mitigate the extremely high interest rates utilised by microfinance. Banks may be encouraged to undertake a series of measures such as guaranteeing of future loans to their customer by linking savings and loans to attract microfinance members. Originality/value – The contribution of this paper, therefore, is to provide a unique opportunity to investigate the association between microfinance institution assets and real interest rates in an African country.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I try to model {{exchange}} rate fluctuations using microstructure theory. While the classical macroeconomic models of exchange rates have shown to {{have little or no}} support at frequencies higher than semiannual (Rime and Sojli, 2006), microstructure models have proved successful in explaining exchange rate movements in relative high frequent data (daily and weekly frequency). Recent literature have attempted to apply microstructure in order to explain exchange rate movements at longer horizons in order to fill the hole which macroeconomic models have proved unable to explain. Chinn and Moore (2010) used monthly data to show that order flow does have explanatory power for {{exchange rate fluctuations}} at this level as well. The authors also found cointegrating relationship between order flows and exchange rates, confirming that the effect of order flow is persistent. This thesis is an extension to the work done at this level of frequency. I utilize two microstructure models in order to explain monthly exchange rate fluctuations for four major exchange rates. Order flows are created from foreign exchange trade statistics published in the Treasury Bulletin. Since literature and theory have shown that the price impact of order flow is dependent on market conditions, I try to control for this variability by adjusting the order flows. Building on theoretical foundations explained in Killeen et al. (2006), I therefore choose to adjust the order flows for uncertainty and liquidity. Furthermore, an attempt to control for hedging by including net option positions into the models is also provided. The Johansen trace test is applied in order to test for cointegration relationships between order flows and exchange rates. The results obtained in this thesis show that adjusted order flow provides better in-sample fit compared with unadjusted order flow. The results also points towards an “undershooting” adjustment mechanism for the exchange rates as the long run price impact are larger than the short run impact. The thesis is organized in following manner; chapter 2 outlines two different approaches to exchange rate modeling, the classical way with macroeconomic “fundamentals” and the microstructure approach which highlights agents heterogeneity and information superiority. The role of order flow in this setting is explained and also why it is an important determinant for explaining exchange rate fluctuations. Also included are some important facts about the exchange rate market structure. Chapter 3 contains a brief, but intuitive explanation of the two models used in this thesis; the <b>Portfolio</b> <b>Shift</b> model and the Liquidity Shock model. Chapter 4 gives a thorough description of the data series used in this thesis. An explanation of how I create order flow series is also provided. Furthermore, the times series properties for the dataset are tested for and discussed. Chapter 5 presents the results found in this thesis. Section 5. 1 deals with econometric results from the <b>Portfolio</b> <b>Shift</b> model with various sorts of proxies for order flow.
