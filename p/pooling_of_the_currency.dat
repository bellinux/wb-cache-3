The survey forecasts are on <b>the</b> exchange rates <b>of</b> five Central and Eastern European currencies: Czech Koruna, Hungarian Forint, Polish Zloty, Romanian Leu and Slovakian Koruna. First, different term-structure models are fitted {{on the survey}} forecasts. Then, <b>the</b> forecasting performances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fitted forecasts are compared. The fitted forecasts for the 5 months horizon and beyond are proved to be significantly better than the random walk on <b>the</b> <b>pooled</b> data <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five <b>currencies.</b> <b>The</b> best performing term-structure model {{is the one that}} assumes an exponential relationship between the forecast and the forecast horizon, and has time-varying parameters. evaluating forecasts, exchange rate, survey forecast, time-varying parameter, term-structure of forecasts...|$|R
40|$|Creatine supplementation is in {{widespread}} use to enhance sports/fitness performance, {{and has been}} trialed successfully in treatment of neurological, neuromuscular and atherosclerotic disease. Creatine plays {{a pivotal role in}} brain energy homeostasis, being a temporal and spatial buffer for cytosolic and mitochondrial <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cellular energy <b>currency,</b> adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and its regulator, adenosine diphosphate. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that oral creatine supplementation (5 g per day for 6 weeks) would enhance intelligence test scores and working memory performance in 45 young adult, vegetarian subjects in a doubleblind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Creatine supplementation had a significant positive effect (P < 0. 0001) on both working memory (backward digit span) and intelligence (Ravens Advanced Progressive Matrices), both tasks which require speed of processing. These findings underline a dynamic and significant role of brain energy capacity in influencing brain performance...|$|R

40|$|Creatine {{monohydrate}} in resistant depression: {{a preliminary}} study Creatine plays {{a pivotal role}} in brain energy homeostasis, being a temporal and spatial buffer for cytosolic and mitochondrial <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cellular energy <b>currency</b> adenosine triphosphate (1). Recent studies have also suggested increased brain utilization of oxygen following oral creatine supplementation (2). Creatine enters the brain (3) via a specialized sodium-dependent transporter, as has been shown by advanced imaging methods (4). Recently, creatine supplementation (5 g ⁄day for six weeks) demonstrated a positive effect on cog-nitive function in normals (5). This suggests that creatine supplementation may enhance <b>the</b> perfor-mance <b>of</b> certain brain areas and might be useful in brain disorders exhibiting hypoactive metabolism, including depression. Accumulated evidence suggests <b>the</b> possible involvement <b>of</b> altered cerebral energy metabolism in <b>the</b> pathophysiology <b>of</b> depression (6). Functional brain imaging studies (positron and single-photon emission tomography) have shown decreased blood flow and metabolism in the frontal lobes and basal ganglia in unipolar depression (7, 8). Fewer data are available regarding bipolar depression, although Ketter et al. (9) did observe a pattern of prefrontal hypometabolism in depressed bipolars. Dager et al. studied depressed or mixed-state bipolar patients using two-dimensional proton echo-planar spectroscopic imaging, reporting an inverse correlation between severity of depression and white matter creatine levels (10). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies have studied brain levels of creatine-containing compounds. Kato et al. (11) reported that phos-phocreatine was significantly decreased in severely (as opposed to mildly) depressed patients. Several studies have used proton MRS in the study o...|$|R
