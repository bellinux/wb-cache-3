Mythological events are depicted in several friezes, with animal friezes being shown in secondary locations. Several iconographic and technical details appear on this vase for the first time. Many are unique, such as the representation of a lowered mast of a sailing ship; others became part of the standard repertoire, such as people sitting with one leg behind the other, instead of with the traditional <b>parallel</b> <b>positioning</b> of the legs.

It involves a closed-loop visual servoing scheme {{in order to}} achieve eye-to-hand positioning task in micro-scale. Instead of using classical visual features in the servoing scheme, pure image photometric information from the vision sensor is employed to compute the control law for micropositioning.

30|$|So, we can {{consider}} that the ear rods of the cephalostats in cephalometric machine and those of facebow are technically the same in that they rely on the anatomical position of EAM. In addition, they rely on the same classical assumption that EAM can represent Po with the <b>parallel</b> <b>positioning.</b> Thus, EAM can be meaningful only when Po can be reproduced by EAM. However, we sometimes suffered from the doubt of their parallelism when the occlusal cant or facial midline is different from our clinical understandings. This condition is worse when the patients have the facial asymmetries. We would not be confident to the procedures of putting the ear rods to EAM and/or the positional disparity between Po and EAM.|$|E
30|$|The {{rationale}} of posterior tilting of a distal implant in {{this study}} is that anatomical and esthetic considerations may not always allow <b>parallel</b> <b>positioning</b> of the implants. Such placement would be a valid compromise to bone grafting, maxillary sinus lift, or mandibular nerve displacement, with the added benefit of shorter treatment times, decreased potential morbidity, and reduced cost [22, 23]. The present finding was similar to the study conducted by Alexander Hazboun and colleagues [6], reporting impression techniques (open vs. closed tray) and implant angulation (0, 15, and 30 °) had no significant effect on in vitro impression accuracy. Similarly, Conrad et al. [2] found that the angle of error between closed and open tray techniques did not differ significantly since the magnitude of distortion was similar for all combinations of impression techniques, implant angulation, and implant numbers.|$|E
40|$|Background: In femoral neck fractures, {{internal}} fixation {{by three}} cannulated hip screws (3 CHS) {{is a common}} procedure with a known high risk of fracture healing complications. Many reports have made recommendations on the positioning of the screws to prevent complications due to mechanical failure. Most of these reports however, are only based on biomechanical studies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the relationship between screw positioning and complication-risk in femoral neck fractures in a clinical setting. Methods: We analyzed retrospectively the fracture healing complication risk in all patients with a femoral neck fracture who underwent 3 CHS fixation between January 2002 and June 2009. In these patients we analyzed the screw positioning in plain postoperative anteroposterior (AP) and axial (AX) radiographs according to our own measuring methods. We analyzed <b>parallel</b> <b>positioning,</b> spreading of the screws in the femoral head and the distance of the screws from the cortex and their influence on the fracture healing complication risk. Results: Within 84 fixations with cannulated screws, 35 (42 %) appeared to be complicated in relation to the fracture healing. The complication-risk was higher in displaced fractures (51 %) than in undisplaced fractures (33 %). No relationship was found between parallel screw alignment or spreading of the screws and fracture healing complications in femoral neck fractures. There was a trend visible favoring a screw distance of 5 - 10 mm to the femoral cortex in AP radiographs (p= 0. 054). Conclusion: In accordance with other studies, a more <b>parallel</b> <b>positioning</b> has no benefit in relation to the fracture healing complication risk. In our study a greater spread of the screws in the femoral head has also no influence on the fracture healing complication risk. A screw distance of 5 - 10 mm from the femoral cortex seems to be beneficial in preventing fracture healing complications. For a higher level of evidence a prospective study with a long-term follow-up and greater patient count is needed. But for now, surgeons should focus on other aspects influencing the complication risk than screw positioning. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on the idea to develop the {{integrated}} model of offshore gangway model including multi-body dynamics model and hydraulic system model with bond-graph method in 20 -sim. And based on that model, active motion compensation control approach will developed in order to compensate the ship motion during gangway operation and further more a <b>parallel</b> <b>position</b> and force control method will be proposed to make the gangway tip maintain constant contact force with windmill platform as well as compensate ship motion during transferring process. In order to get reasonable data for modeling, simulation and control of gangway operation, an offshore gangway was designed first based on the relative rules and existing products from Uptime Company. Then multi-body dynamic model is developed with IC-field based on the Lagrangian Hamiltonian equation of gangway. After that, the hydraulic system for gangway was designed and verified with simulation. Based on this developed model, the control algorithm for active motion control and <b>parallel</b> <b>position</b> and force control were proposed.

40|$|International audience— Direct {{photometric}} visual servoing {{uses only}} the pure image information {{as a visual}} feature, instead of using classic geometric features such as points or lines. It was demonstrated efficiently in {{6 degrees of freedom}} (DoF) positioning. However, in micro-scale, using only image intensity as a visual feature performs unsatisfactorily in cases where the photometric variation is low, such as motions along vision sensor's focal axis under a high magnification. In order to improve the performance and accuracy in those cases, an approach using hybrid visual features is proposed in this paper. Image gradient is employed as a visual feature on z axis while image intensity is used on the other 5 DoFs to control the motion. A 6 -DoF micro-positioning task is accomplished by this hybrid visual servoing scheme. The experimental results obtained on a <b>parallel</b> <b>positioning</b> micro-stage under a digital microscope show the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method...|$|E

40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{positioning}} technologies has been exploited to flexibly configure fiber ends on the focal surfaces of telescopes. The earliest instruments used manual plugging, or glued buttons on the focal plane. Later instruments have used robotic fisherman-round-the-pond probes and articulated armsto position fibres, each probe or arm operated by its own motors, or buttons on fiber ends moved by pick-and-place robotic positioners. A positioner using fiber spines incorporating individual actuators operating over limited patrol areas is currently being manufactured and a derivative proposed for future large telescopes. Other techniques, using independent agents carrying the fiber ends about the focal plane have been prototyped We describe these various fiber positioning techniques and compare them, listing the issues associated with their implementation, and consider the factors which make each of them suitable for a given situation.

40|$|The {{controlled}} {{dispersion of}} fluids, particularly biologically relevant solutions in micro-volumes, is of high practical interest in biotechnology and medicine. Pharmaceutical test assays, for example, need {{a method for}} the fast and defined deposition of fluid samples. Most current micro-dispensing methods, i. e. contact-based pin printing, have problems such as time delays, limited dosing velocity, minimum volume or high interference that limit biological applications. Spraying techniques suffer {{from a lack of}} reproducibility; a defined deposition of samples on targets is not possible. Here, we introduce a new method for the parallel and spatially defined dispersion of many micro-volumes that overcomes disadvantages of common micro-dispensers. The overall approach is that a fluid drop, produced by a droplet generator, falls on a free trajectory with a defined kinetic energy, and is split by a masking unit placed perpendicular to the flight direction into at least two smaller droplets (Zimmermann et al. in Method and device for dosing fluid media, WO/ 2002 / 102515, Germany, 2002). On the target, the resulting droplets form reproducible patterns, which are enlarged and scalable images of the grid pattern. Possible applications for this method are non-contact cell patterning, cell encapsulation, cryopreservation and fast mixing processes in micro-volumes. Here, we use this method for the direct and defined <b>parallel</b> <b>positioning</b> of cell suspensions on specific Substrates, which call be useful for test assays, tissue engineering and cryopreservation...|$|E
40|$|Modern sawmills are {{increasingly}} like process industries, running continuously with very large volumes {{flowing through the}} process every second. This fact makes it vital for every company to utilize its equipment and raw material as effectively as possible to maximize yield and value. The objective of this simulated breakdown study was to analyze the potential to increase volume yield in Swedish sawmills. While the commonly used horns-down position performs well on an average basis, {{the results show that}} the optimal rotation position for an individual log is most often found at another position. Results from extended simulations show that the average volume yield can be increased further by applying the optimal combination of rotation and <b>parallel</b> <b>positioning</b> in cant and deal saw. An increase in average volume yield by 4. 5 percentage points (8. 6 %) would enable a typical Swedish sawmill to produce a further 17, 300 m 3 of boards per year and thereby increase potential annual income by US$ 3. 7 million per year. This optimization concept requires a preevaluation of every log in order to define the optimal combination of settings. Some of these procedures must be performed online within a split second to accommodate production speed demands. Modern technology such as industrial x-ray in combination with traceability methods, multivariate models, breakdown simulation software, and high-performance computers enables evaluation and optimization of every log online at full production speed.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a nano Field Effect Transistor (FET) biosensor using zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire aligned on gold nanogap electrodes. Nano-FET biosensors are an emerging nanoelectronic technology capable of real-time and label-free quantification of soluble biological molecules. The device {{consists of a}} single functionalized ZnO nanowire, as the conducting channel to detect proteins, and of aligned gate electrodes with well-defined nanosized gaps. ZnO were synthesized by hydrothermal reaction and chemically functionalized with amino-propyl groups. We positioned single wires through dielectrophoresis across nanogap electrodes, using a custom platform based on a chip constituted by four nanogaps, thus leading to the <b>parallel</b> <b>positioning</b> and testing of four ZnO wires. Nanogap electrodes with a controlled nanometric separation were ad-hoc fabricated by Electromigration-Induced Break Junction (EIBJ) using a low-cost electronic system. The obtained FETs have a n-type channel and operate in enhancement mode. We have proved the binding of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} device architecture. The binding was conducted with EDC-amidation reaction among the amine groups of the functionalized ZnO and the carboxyl groups of the protein. The whole process serves as a model system to study in-situ and as a function of time the protein interaction with the ZnO surface [...] By dropping a tiny amount of BSA solution with the specific reagents for the EDC-amidation reaction on the ZnO-nanogap chip, we were able to monitor the drain-source current IDS as a function of time. The results showed a constant reduction of the IDS upon protein binding to the ZnO surface, leading to a precise understanding of the protein-surface phenomena. We have also examined the dependence of the IDS as function of the gate voltage VG and we refer to this response as the "device characteristics".
