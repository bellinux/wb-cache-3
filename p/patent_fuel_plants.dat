40|$|Previous {{feasibility}} studies Bechtel (1975), TRW (1975) for {{electric power generation}} utilizing geothermal resources have tended to focus primarily on the power plant and have neglected the fuel production and effluent disposal facilities. The Dow Chemical USA study (1974) for the Governor's Energy Advisory Council, State of Texas, placed equal emphasis on the power <b>plant</b> and the <b>fuel</b> <b>plant.</b> The study reported in Chapter II and in what follows in this chapter, also places equal emphasis on {{the two types of}} facilities. It is important that the <b>fuel</b> <b>plant,</b> the well field, the <b>fuel</b> processing <b>plant,</b> and the effluent disposal facility be the subject of a preliminary conceptual design and costing activity so that economic and net energetics analysis can be performed. The activity also serves to assess technological maturity of the <b>fuel</b> <b>plant</b> and to identify technical problems requiring further study. The resource considered was the model resource outlined in Sectio B, Chapter II. <b>Fuel</b> <b>plants</b> were outlined for three power generation plants: single-stage flash steam, two-stage flash steam, and propane secondary working fluid plant...|$|R

5000|$|The ship met {{its demise}} on 18 March 1906 {{as the result}} of a collision. It was on passage from Cardiff for Antwerp with <b>patent</b> <b>fuel</b> when it {{collided}} with the British steamer SS Thor off Portland Bill. The wreck today lies at a minimum depth of 51 metres and a max of 57, about 8-10 miles south-east off Portland Bill. The wreck sits upright and complete although the majority of decking has collapsed inwards. The engine remains visible, whilst the coal block cargo, weighing around 28 lbs each, (<b>Patent</b> <b>Fuel</b> blocks), remain scattered around the site. These bear the words [...] "Patent Cardiff" [...] along with a crown. HAPAG crockery has been recovered from the wreck as has her stern dolphin binnacle and builders plate. Additionally one or two brass letters of her name have been found and recovered in the bow area, along with some portholes.|$|R
