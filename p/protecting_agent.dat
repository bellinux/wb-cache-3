50|$|Ensulizole (INN; {{also known}} as phenylbenzimidazole {{sulfonic}} acid) is a common sunscreen agent. In 1999, the United States Food and Drug Administration regulated that the name ensulizole be used on sunscreen labels in the United States. Ensulizole is primarily a UVB <b>protecting</b> <b>agent</b> providing only minimal UVA protection. The scope of UVB is 290 to 340 nanometers whereas the UVA range is 320 to 400 nanometers. For better UVA protection, it must be paired with avobenzone, titanium dioxide, or zinc oxide; outside of the United States {{it can also be}} paired with a UV absorber of the Tinosorb or Mexoryl types. Because ensulizole is water-soluble, it has the characteristic of feeling lighter on skin. As such, it is often used in sunscreen lotions or moisturizers whose aesthetic goal is a non-greasy finish. The free acid is poorly soluble in water, so it is only used as its soluble salts.|$|E

The experimental matrix is formed by 56 different combinations of protective agent concentration and ‘reducing agent/loading agent’ ratio. From these 56 combinations, a wide range of AgNPs can be obtained with different colors (yellow, orange, red, violet, blue, green, brown) and tunable shape and size. Henceforward, for the sake of simplicity, this experimental matrix will be named the multicolor silver map.

Protecting polymers used were PAA, PVP, PVA and an oligosaccharide-based <b>protecting</b> <b>agent,</b> arabinogalactan. This {{is the first}} systematic study of colloids generated in mixed solvent dispersion media with these protecting agents. The sols were characterized by TEM, UV/Vis spectrophotometry and Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS). In general, the macroscopic stability of the sols depended on the protecting agent/organic cosolvent combination used, with a nonlinear dependence on cosolvent concentration. Observed sol stabilities correlated well with pre-existing hydrodynamic data for the protective polymers, e. g. radius of gyration data. Average particle size and polydispersity of all sols examined decreased as cosolvent concentration increased, with actual cosolvent concentration, <b>protecting</b> <b>agent</b> and reducing agent used influencing the extent of decrease. Sol particle sizes ranged from 0. 8 nm to 6. 0 nm with sol turbidities decreasing in parallel with the particle sizes.

40|$|Multiwall carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{decorated with}} cobalt oxide (CoOx) nanoparticles (NPs) are prepared in various synthesis conditions to investigate their capability as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts for fuel cells in alkaline media. The synthesis conditions {{include the use}} of protecting, reducing or complexing agents and heat treatment. Higher ORR activity is possible for smaller size of Co NPs catalysts due to the enlarged interfaces between Co species and CNTs. The addition of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as <b>protecting</b> <b>agent</b> and NaBH 4 during the preparation procedure is necessary for obtaining the highest activity since it favors the formation of lower oxidation states for Co species and the incorporation of N groups which improve ORR activity. CNTs loaded with only 1 wt. % of Co NPs prepared by a facile method using PVP, NaBH 4 and subsequent heat treatment at 500 °C under N 2 atmosphere, demonstrates both similar catalytic activity and stability than Pt/Vulcan (20 wt. % Pt on Vulcan).
