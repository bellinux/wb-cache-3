This measure is completed on a computer by working with 150 stimulus words. The stimulus words contain 25 insect names, 25 flower names, 25 musical instrument names, 25 weapon names, 25 pleasant-meaning words, and 25 unpleasant-meaning words. The participants are shown a set of words and then <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> {{in response to the}} words. The participants' reaction times represent their connection between themselves and nature (faster times mean higher connection). A recent study found that when positive categories (such as flowers) were paired with a pleasant word, the reaction time was faster than when flowers were paired with a negative word.

50|$|During bootup, some (especially older) PC BIOS {{versions}} {{will wait}} indefinitely for a user to <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> before proceeding if some basic devices, {{such as a}} video card or keyboard, are not installed or connected, effectively halting an unattended system.|$|E
50|$|When {{studying}} insight, or the Aha! Effect, ERP or EEG {{general methods}} are used. Initially a baseline measurement is taken, which generally asks {{the subject to}} simply remember an answer to a question. Following this, subjects are asked {{to focus on the}} screen while a logogriph is shown, and then they are given time with a blank screen to get the answer, once they do they are required to <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>key.</b> After which the answer appears on the screen. The subjects are then asked to press one key to indicate that they thought of the correct answer and another to indicate if they got the answer wrong, finally, not to <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> at all if they were unsure or did not know the answer.|$|E
50|$|The {{specialist}} DataHand keyboard uses optical {{technology to}} sense keypresses {{with a single}} light beam and sensor per key. The keys are held in their rest position by magnets; when the magnetic force is overcome to <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>key,</b> the optical path is unblocked and the keypress is registered.|$|E
50|$|On an {{immediate}} execution calculator, the user <b>presses</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> for each operation, by pressing keys to calculate all the intermediate results, {{before the final}} value is shown.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pressing</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> on <b>a</b> {{keyboard}} or <b>a</b> {{combination of}} <b>keys</b> generates <b>a</b> keyboard event, enabling the program currently running {{to respond to}} the introduced data such as which key/s the user pressed.|$|R
50|$|When an operator, enciphering <b>a</b> message, <b>pressed</b> <b>a</b> <b>key,</b> <b>an</b> {{electric}} current {{passed through the}} machine and the rotors turned mechanically, but not in unison. Every time <b>a</b> <b>key</b> was pushed, the first rotor would rotate one letter. This happened 26 times until the first rotor had made a complete revolution. Then the second rotor would start to rotate. And so on.|$|R
50|$|The PC {{version of}} the game has a mission editor, which allows players {{to create their own}} {{missions}} for single player, multiplayer and cooperative game modes. The editor is real time, meaning no pre-render of the work is needed, users <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> and can drop into the mission 'live' to test out or play. The editor supports many features including time of day, visual effects, dynamic weather and Lua scripting.|$|E
50|$|Early {{computers}} were typically operated using mechanical teleprinters, which provided a continuous printed record of their output. However, during the 1970s, these became obsolete and were replaced with visual display units, and text was lost once it scrolled {{off the top}} of the screen. To compensate, programs typically paused operation after displaying one screen of data, so that the user could observe the results and then <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> to move to the next screen.|$|E
50|$|Confabulations {{can also}} be {{researched}} by using continuous recognition tasks. These tasks are often {{used in conjunction with}} confidence ratings. Generally, in a recognition task, participants are rapidly presented with pictures. Some of these pictures are shown once; others are shown multiple times. Participants <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> if they have seen the picture previously. Following a period of time, participants repeat the task. More errors on the second task, versus the first, are indicative of confusion, representing false memories.|$|E
50|$|The term is {{also used}} in the {{computer}} game Microsoft Flight Simulator wherein the user <b>presses</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> {{and he or she}} can rotate and move the virtual aircraft along all three spatial planes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{introduction}} of F-Lock {{was marked by}} criticism on several points. First, the behaviour was unintuitive: <b>Pressing</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> such as F4 by default no longer had its normal meaning, so combinations such as [...] appeared not to work.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pressing</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> {{on any one}} of the chordboard's four {{keyboards}} {{sounds a}} single note within the chord zone. Each key plays only one note. To play a chord, the musician plays two or more <b>keys,</b> similar to <b>a</b> piano.|$|R
5000|$|As {{time went}} on and BASIC was no longer shipped on all PCs, this {{interrupt}} would simply display an error message indicating that no bootable volume was found (famously, [...] "No ROM BASIC", or more explanatory messages in later BIOS versions); in other BIOS versions it would prompt the user to insert a bootable volume and <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>key,</b> and then after the user pressed a key it would loop back to the bootstrap loader (INT 19h) to try booting again.|$|E
50|$|The C64GS {{has been}} plagued with {{problems}} from the outset. Firstly, despite the wealth of software already available on cartridge for C64, {{the lack of a}} keyboard means that most cannot be used with the console. This means that people had often bought secondhand C64 software on cartridge only to find that the games are not compatible. The standard C64 version of Terminator 2: Judgment Day was designed for the console, but was included on a cartridge that required the user to <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> to access the game, rendering it unplayable.|$|E
50|$|Sequence {{learning}} is usually tested through a visual task where participants {{react to a}} series of visual events {{which may or may not}} be sequentially structured. In the task, visual stimuli appear in a specific place on a computer screen and participants are told to <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>key.</b> The stimuli may follow an underlying pattern or follow a set of transition rules which the participant is unaware of. Studies show that participants reacting to structured stimuli have a faster resulting reaction time than those exposed to random stimuli. The participants are unable to explain the acquisition of their knowledge.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pressing</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> on the dialpad {{more times}} than appears in {{succession}} in the phone number, thereby completing {{the length of the}} number prior to completing the intended number (example 7522-7 with the final 7 being ignored rather than 7527) ...|$|R
5000|$|Reticle / cursor / {{crosshair}} - {{an indication}} of where the character is aiming or where the mouse pointer is. <b>Pressing</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> while pointing at an object or character with the cursor can issue actions like shooting, talking, picking up objects, manipulating switches, using computers, etc.|$|R
30|$|We next {{used the}} data to verify that the {{proposed}} 3 -D key positions can be <b>pressed</b> separately with <b>a</b> single finger. PIP joint movement used to <b>press</b> <b>an</b> upper <b>key</b> cannot interfere with other proposed keys because when the PIP joint moves to <b>press</b> <b>an</b> upper <b>key,</b> the fingertip moves in the positive direction in the y- and z-axes (Fig.  3), which is {{away from the other}} proposed keys. Fingertip movement to <b>press</b> <b>a</b> lower <b>key</b> might interfere with <b>a</b> middle <b>key</b> placed at the middle phalanx because when the fingertip moves to press the lower key, the DIP joint moves in the negative direction in the y-axis (Fig.  3). In contrast, fingertip movement to <b>press</b> <b>a</b> lower <b>key</b> cannot interfere with other keys if the middle key is placed in the same position as on a standard keyboard because fingertip movement is in a positive direction in the z-axis, which avoids pressing <b>a</b> middle <b>key,</b> and the PIP joint moves in a positive direction in the z-axis, which avoids pressing the upper key (Fig.  3).|$|R

5000|$|Programs {{written for}} single-tasking {{operating}} {{systems such as}} MS-DOS/PC DOS can go into endless loops until interrupted; for example when waiting for a user to <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>key.</b> Whilst {{this is not a}} problem where there is no other process waiting to run, it wastes valuable processor time that could be used by other programs in a multi-tasking/multi-user environment like CDOS386. Applications designed for a multi-tasking environment use API calls to [...] "sleep" [...] when they are idle {{for a period of time}} but normal DOS applications do not do this so Idle Detection must be used.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the era of}} {{inexpensive}} computers, the principal use for multitasking was to allow many people to share the same computer. Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly, {{in direct proportion to}} the number of programs it is running, but most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks. If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> on the keyboard, then it will not take a [...] "time slice" [...] until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss.|$|E

50|$|Musicians {{play some}} string {{instruments}} by plucking the strings with their fingers or a plectrum—and others by hitting the strings {{with a light}} wooden hammer or by rubbing the strings with a bow. In some keyboard instruments, such as the harpsichord or piano, the musician <b>presses</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> that plucks the string or strikes it with a hammer.|$|R
5|$|Although the Mellotron was {{designed}} to reproduce {{the sound of the}} original instrument, replaying a tape creates minor fluctuations in pitch (wow and flutter), and amplitude, so a note sounds slightly different each time it is played. <b>Pressing</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> harder allows the head to come into contact under greater pressure, {{to the extent that the}} Mellotron responds to aftertouch.|$|R
50|$|During normal typing on a {{conventional}} computer keyboard, only one key is usually pressed {{at any given}} time, then released before the next key is pressed. However, {{this is not always}} the case. When using modifier keys such as Shift or Control, the user intentionally holds the modifier key(s) while pressing and releasing another key. Rapid typists may also sometimes inadvertently <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> before releasing the previous one. Certain unusual forms of keyboarding require multiple keys to be pressed or held down simultaneously; for example, Braille2000 keying requires as many as six keys to be pressed at once analogous to the six dot keys of a Braille typewriter. Some computer games require keys (other than the usual modifier keys) to be held down while others are pressed and released.|$|E
5000|$|In {{cognitive}} psychology, {{the measurement}} of the time {{to respond to a}} given stimulus is often of interest. In these measurements, a ceiling may be the lowest possible number (the fewest milliseconds to a response), rather than the highest value, as is the usual interpretation of [...] "ceiling". In response time studies, it may appear that a ceiling had occurred in the measurements due to an apparent clustering around some minimum amount of time (such as the 250 ms needed by many people to <b>press</b> <b>a</b> <b>key).</b> However, this clustering could actually represent a natural physiological limit of response time, rather than an artifact of the stopwatch sensitivity (which of course would be a ceiling effect). Further statistical study, and scientific judgment, can resolve whether or not the observations are due to a ceiling or are the truth of the matter.|$|E

50|$|Events are packets sent by {{the server}} to a client to {{communicate}} that something the client {{may be interested in}} has happened. For example, an event is sent when the user <b>presses</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> or clicks <b>a</b> mouse button. Events are not only used for input: for example, events are sent to indicate the creation of new subwindows of a given window.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{internal}} {{operations of}} <b>a</b> Mellotron. <b>Pressing</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> (1), causes two screws (2) to connect a pressure pad (3) with the tape head (5), and the pinch wheel (4) with the continuously rotating capstan (6). Tape is pulled at a gradual speed, counterbalanced by a tension spring (8-10) and stored temporarily in a storage bin (7) until {{the key is}} released.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of head-up display (HUD) location on response time and detection probability of HUD warnings. Twenty-four subjects, sitting in a driving simulator, watched a projected videotape of driving in traffic on a real road. The subjects <b>pressed</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> whenever they detected predetermined events in the road scene (passing cars, leading car signals, or road signs). In addition, the subjects <b>pressed</b> <b>a</b> <b>key</b> when <b>a</b> warning triangle appeared on the HUD at one of 15 locations. Response times to HUD warnings, and detection probability, varied with warning location. The mean response times ranged from 842 to 1390 ms with the fastest response time 5 ° {{to the right of}} the center. The HUD task did not significantly interfere with detection of road events. When the HUD task was added to the driving task, response times to car signals increased only slightly (from 1175 to 1260 ms) and the detection probability did not change...|$|R
