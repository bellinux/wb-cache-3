50|$|In 1925, the Nevada Department of Highways {{advocated}} mitigating corrugations with crushed <b>pit-run</b> gravel, using material 1 in and smaller, including {{only the}} fines from crushing. Contemporaneous advice from Colorado {{was to use}} a well-graded gravel, not exceeding 1.25 in and including 25-40% fines passing a 0.25 in sieve, {{but not more than}} 5% passing a #10 (2.0-mm) sieve. The maintenance advice from Colorado was to drag or grade the road frequently, applying light volumes of new gravel with minimal sand content and providing good drainage with a crown. The same source advises reduction of traffic speed.|$|E
5000|$|The Cartier Railway is an {{engineering}} marvel and was constructed using all the modern, state-of-the art techniques {{available at the}} time, including making extensive use of aerial mapping to select the best route through the very mountainous terrain. The initial 190 mi rail line used natural drainage extensively by following the Rochers and Toulnustouc River valleys to keep the grades at a minimum. The ruling grade for southbound loaded trains was kept to a very easy 0.4% while the northbound ruling grade was only 1.35%. Numerous rock cuts had to be blasted and five tunnels, ranging from 350 to 1440 ft, were built where rock cuts weren't possible. The heavy haul nature of this railway, all rail, including sidings and yard tracks made all constructed be using [...] rail in 78 ft lengths. Since curves account for 54.3% of the main line, extensive use of flange oilers was needed. The oilers were located every 8 mi or 250 degrees of curvature, whichever was less. Granite, blasted and removed during construction of the harbor at Port Cartier was crushed and used as ballast on the first 54 mi of the line, while local <b>pit-run</b> gravel {{was used for the}} remainder. Twenty-two bridges were needed for the railroad, with the bridge at Milepost 68.5 being the longest (880 ft) and highest (120 ft) on the line. The railway also required the construction of 1,524 culverts for drainage.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{suitability}} of soils {{for the construction}} of subgrade is determined by their road-building properties. For this purpose coarse, sandy and sandy loam soils are the most suitable. Many coarse man-made soils are formed during mining. These soils undergo significant changes in composition, structure and texture of natural minerals under the influence of weather and climatic factors. Coarse man-made soils may differ by petrographic composition and metamorphism of minerals. These multi-component systems are composed of fine-grained components and large particles varying in strength, water and frost resistance. The aggregate strength characteristic was taken as an integrated criterion for the assessment of embankment subgrade based in part on the capabilities of the test and also the need {{for the creation of a}} dense structure for multi-component coarse soils. From this, a technological classification for coarse soils was developed. The problem of using coarse soil in embankments is the possibility of soil settlements occurrence due to the large space between the particles and due to the impact of weather and climate factors. For ensuring a stable structure of subgrade, such coarse soils should be either isolated from the influence of weather and climatic factors or the structure of the subgrade should be made dense non-settling properties by means of technological solutions that envisage filling the entire space between the large particles with fine-grained materials (e. g. <b>pit-run</b> fines). The design solutions are developed depending on the type of coarse soil. This will protect the embankment body from the effects of weather and climatic factors, namely: wetting-drying and freezing- thawing. To ensure durability and stability of the embankment slopes, technological solutions for creating a single strong structure were developed. Effective subgrade structures that take into account the characteristics of these materials and ensure their sustainability and stability were developed basing on the results of coal waste research...|$|E
40|$|The {{extensively}} used AASHTO {{structural design}} procedures for flexible pavement indicate the required pavement design {{in terms of}} a structural number. For a particular pavement thickness design, this structural number can be computed from the sum of each pavement layer's thickness multiplied by its strength parameter, called the structural layer coefficient. The research work reported herein presents methods for determining the structural layer coefficients for asphalt emulsion-aggregate mixtures. A hot plant-mixed asphaltic concrete was evaluated for structural layer coefficient, and the radial stress vs. fatigue failure relationship was developed using circular specimens and the Jimenez deflectometer. Relationships between structural number and load repetitions to failure for different loading conditions were developed. These relationships were used to evaluate the structural numbers of other specimens when tested to failure in flexural fatigue. Three asphalt emulsion-aggregate mixtures were designed using CSS-lh asphalt emulsion. The aggregates used for the three mixtures were: (1) Type I aggregate using dense-graded, crushed, river gravel; (2) Type II aggregate using <b>pit-run,</b> coarse sand; and (3) Type III aggregate using a silty sand. These mixtures were evaluated for Marshall stability, Hveem stability and cohesiometer value, unconfined compressive strength, double punch tensile strength and dynamic modulus of elasticity at various ages from 3 to 28 days. Flexural fatigue life, when tested in the deflectometer, was determined for all mixtures at 7 and 28 days. Structural numbers for the specimens and structural layer coefficients for the mixtures were determined. Relationships were developed between the evaluation tests performed and the structural layer coefficients at various mixture ages by using test results from the three mixtures and a regression analysis procedure. A fourth asphalt emulsion-aggregate mixture using CSS-lh asphalt emulsion and a Type II crusher-run aggregate was designed. Evaluation tests were performed at 3 and 7 days and layer coefficients for the mixture were predicted for 7 and 28 days using the regression equations developed. Layer coefficients at 7 and 28 days were also determined by testing specimens in fatigue in the deflectometer and computing their structural numbers and layer coefficients. Layer coefficients determined in these two manners indicated favorable comparisons. The results of this research provides information about the structural layer coefficients for asphalt emulsion-aggregate mixtures. The relationships between the evaluation tests and structural layer coefficient can be used for determining layer coefficients for other asphalt emulsion-aggregate mixtures. Because the evaluation tests used were tests commonly performed in most asphalt laboratories, these determinations can be made without the necessity of additional equipment or procedures in most cases...|$|E
