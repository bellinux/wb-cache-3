50|$|For {{completely}} accurate results, {{the crucible}} is handled with clean tongs because fingerprints can add weighable mass to the crucible. Porcelain crucibles are hygroscopic, i. e. they absorb {{a bit of}} weighable moisture from the air. For this reason, the porcelain crucible and lid is also <b>pre-fired</b> (pre-heating to high temperature) to constant mass before the pre-weighing. This determines {{the mass of the}} completely dry crucible and lid. At least two firings, coolings, and weighings resulting in exactly the same mass are needed to confirm constant (completely dry) mass of the crucible and lid and similarly again for the crucible, lid, and sample residue inside. Since the mass of every crucible and lid is different, the pre-firing/pre-weighing must be done for every new crucible/lid used. The desiccator contains desiccant to absorb moisture from the air inside, so the air inside will be completely dry.|$|E

30|$|Our {{observations}} {{showed that}} the gilding decorations are performed on a blue alkali glaze. Plant ash was suggested {{to be the source}} of alkali and cobalt was identified as the colouring agent of the glaze. Moreover, trace amounts of arsenic in the composition of the blue glaze was interpreted {{to be associated with the}} colouring agent of the glaze; i.e., cobalt. Furthermore, the gilding decorations were suggested to be achieved by firing gold powder on the <b>pre-fired</b> blue substrate glaze. AFM, SEM and optical microscopy proved that the gold flakes partially penetrated the <b>pre-fired</b> blue substrate glaze.|$|E
30|$|This paper {{established}} a local provenance for the colouring {{agent of the}} blue glaze used as a substrate of gilding decorations.

30|$|Although {{the use of}} gold powder for gilding {{vitreous}} materials {{has been}} reported previously [3, 4], technical literature about Islamic gilded tiles does not support this idea.

In addition, there is no general consensus about the technique of applying either gold leaf or powder on archaeological glazes. While the use of an organic adhesive as mordant of gold leaf has already been reported [5, 6], a firing process has also been suggested to be the reason of adhering gold leaf on a <b>pre-fired</b> glaze [2]. In support of the former idea, there is the Abu’l Qasim’s treatise in which he describes how to fire gold leafs on a <b>pre-fired</b> glassy surface [7, 8].|$|E

40|$|The {{well-known}} lanthanide cuprates {{exist in}} two principal forms, T and T´, which behave as p-type and n-type conductors, respectively. In {{order to understand}} the structural properties and crystal chemistry from the T to T´ phase, the Nd₁. ₈₋ₓLaₓPr₀. ₂CuO₄ (NLPCO) system was studied varying the La substitution ratio (0 ≤x≤ 1. 8) and then characterised using high temperature X-ray powder diffraction. From analysis of the X-ray diffraction patterns obtained at room temperature, there are clearly five distinguishable regions for the NLPCO system. They are, (1) monophasic T´ solid–solution (2) two phase mixture T´ + T´´ (3) monophasic T´´solid–solution (4) two phase mixture T´´ + O and finally (5) monophasic O phase solid–solution. The T´´ form has previously been suggested as an ordered form of T´; however here we show via high temperature X-ray diffraction studies that it is a non-transformable metastable phase formed on quenching of the T phase via an orthorhombically distorted variant. Also neutron diffraction and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) studies confirmed that the T ´´phase is 4 - fold Cu coordinated. The structural, magnetic and electrical properties of this NLPCO series have been investigated for the selected compositions using X-ray diffraction, magnetization measurements, thermal analysis and conductivity measurements. The aim of the second half of this work was to discover the basic high temperature electrical characteristics of Nd₂₋ₓPrₓCuO₄ and investigate how this matches with those required for components on the SOFC cathode side to identify which dopant level shows highest conductivity and whether it is stable at different temperatures. The idea was to make a new concept in SOFC cathodes and current collector development, using n-type conductors instead of p- type conductors and to try to produce a high conductivity material which is stable under the chemical and thermal stresses that exist while under load {{that can be used in}} cathode or current collector applications. The Nd₂₋ₓPrₓCuO₄ (NPCO) series has been studied over a range of dopant levels (x= 0. 15 - 0. 25) and maximum conductivity of 86. 7 Scm⁻¹ has been obtained for the composition where x = 0. 25. Also NPCO shows n-type semiconductor behaviour which gives operational advantages when operating at mild oxygen deficiency. AC impedance studies have been carried out on symmetrical cells to investigate the performance of NPCO as a cathode material. These studies mainly focused on polarization resistance and the activation energies of the cells. Low Rp values and low activation energies are obtained for a composite cathode compared to pure cathode material. Two configurations of NPCO as cathode materials were tested, <b>pre-fired</b> and in-siu fired. <b>Pre-fired</b> NPCO exhibited better performance than in-situ fired NPCO. Both in-situ and <b>pre-fired</b> current collecting NPCO still showed lowest activation energies which suggest good catalytic activity. From all of these studies, it is evident that the praseodymium doped neodymium cuprate material shows considerable promise as a potential cathode material for solid oxide fuel cell applications...|$|E

The study evidenced a myriad of complex phenomena, including devitrification, relevant bleeding of the glass on alumina substrates, anomalous distribution of conductive grains in the glassy matrix, phase separations. Contrarily to what happens in traditional systems, it is difficult to get a wide resistance range simply by changing the fraction of the conductive phase.

The cerium-substituted yttrium-iron garnet (Ce-YIG) in CexY 3 –xFe 5 O 12 is {{considered}} as a promising material for applications in high frequency wireless communication technology. In this work, we reported the structural properties of Ce-YIG. This material was produced via conventional solid state reaction (CSSR) with various molar ratio of cerium (x = 0. 0, 0. 1, 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5, respectively). A heat treatment was at a temperature of 1420 °C for 6 h after <b>pre-fired</b> at 1100 oC for 6 h. Multiple phases were presented in Ce-YIG ceramics.

40|$|AbstractIn this work, {{an attempt}} to reduce {{electrode}} polarization of an anode-supported solid oxide fuel cell with two approaches and {{the improvement of the}} cell electrochemical performance is reported. In fabrication of a conventional single solid oxide fuel cell, yttria stabilized zirconia (8 YSZ), NiO- 8 YSZ, and lanthanum strontium cobalt fluorite (LSCF) were used as electrolyte, anode and cathode materials. On the <b>pre-fired</b> porous anode support, the electrolyte was deposited by electrophoresis deposition while the cathode layer was deposited using a screen-printing method. The first approach was performed by a deposition of samaria doped ceria (SDC) interlayer to prevent formation of an insulating phase between 8 YSZ/LSCF interface, while the second approach involved adjustment of the anode microporous structure. The electrochemical performance of the fabricated cells was characterized using an impedance spectroscopy technique. The results showed that insertion of the interlayer between the LSCF cathode and YSZ electrolyte could prevent insulating phase formation, giving rise to a significantly decrease in polarization resistance and a much improved power density over the reference cell. In addition, the anode polarization was further reduced with pore enlargement in the anode substrate together with the fine microstructure of anode functional layer...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{alkaline}} earth– based perovskite ceramics {{are potential}} electrolytes for components of electrolysers, fuel cells and CO 2 /syngas converters. Their high refractariness {{is an advantage}} from the chemical stability point of view but involves high sintering temperature (> 1500 °C), detrimental to the co-sintering procedure required to assemble device components. Since the presence of protonic species is not intrinsic to the perovskite structure, the Ln – modified perovskites have to be successfully protonated by exposition of dense (95 – 99 % theoretical density) ceramic pieces to (pressurized) water. We demonstrate that densification of a AZr 1 -xLnxO 3 -δ ceramic can be enhanced by prior exposition of 1200 to 1300 °C <b>pre-fired</b> (porous) ceramics to high water pressure using an autoclave. Autoclave temperature and treatment duration are considered.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present bulk XRF/XRD and micro {{analytical}} SEM/EMPA data on historical bricks from Medieval/Renaissance buildings of Ferrara (NE Italy) to provide insights {{on the nature}} and provenance of the raw material as well as clues on the sintering techniques. Chemical data indicate that the starting materials were obtained by mixing high Cr-Ni clay and subordinate sand (both quarried from the Po river alluvial deposits) with the possible introduction of a Na-rich flux component. Thin section observation, XRD and micro-analytical data indicate the presence of key accessory phases such as pyroxene, amphibole, epidote and rare olivine in the <b>pre-fired</b> mineral assemblage and confirming the utilization of the Po river sediments. Recognition of neo-formation firing phases (e. g. melilite, wollastonite), together with composition of micas, amphiboles and interstitial glasses, indicate kiln temperatures between 800 and 1000 °C.

Daily (24 h) average PM 2. 5 samples were collected on <b>pre-fired</b> quartz-fiber filters with low-volume samplers and analyzed by the thermal optical reflectance (TOR) method following the Interagency Monitoring of PROtected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) protocol. The average indoor and outdoor concentrations of PM 2. 5 were 88. 8 μg/m 3 and 99. 1 μg/m 3, respectively. The average indoor OC and EC concentrations were 21. 7 μg/m 3, and 7. 6 μg/m 3, respectively, accounting {{for an average of}} 25. 5 % and 8. 9 % indoor PM 2. 5 mass, respectively. The average indoor and outdoor OC/EC ratios were 3. 4 and 3. 0, respectively. The average I/O ratios of PM 2. 5, OC and EC were 0. 91, 1. 02 and 0. 96, respectively. Poor indoor-outdoor correlations were observed for OC in the summer (R 2 = 0. 18) and winter (R 2 = 0. 33), while strong correlations (R 2 > 0. 8) were observed for EC during summer and winter.

40|$|The post-firing {{variability}} of fire-affected rock (FAR) {{recovered from a}} stone-cooking platform within a prehistoric stone grill was examined. This examination tested the physical properties of FAR recovered from site CA-SBR- 3773, located the Crowder Canyon Archaeological District in San Bernardino County, California. There {{is a lack of}} archaeological research in this area of Southern California; however, this project established a fundamental perspective of thermal feature reuse and episodes of firing activity for prehistoric cooking features by examining the physical changes FAR experienced due to various heat exposures. Regional archaeologists often encounter these features as they speckle the landscape of upland desert regions in California. This research is an experimental project that compares the cultural stones’ properties to those of non-cultural origin, which have been fired various times during controlled replicative experimentation. The end comparison identifies the FARs’ change in physical conditions. Repeated exposure to high temperatures has a direct relationship to the stability and matrices of rock, in this particular case, schist (Yavuz et al. 2010). As the stone is repeatedly exposed to high temperatures, its durability and structural components begin to deteriorate. This deterioration can be measured and compared to <b>pre-fired</b> physical properties. One of these physical properties is the stones’ porosity, which is calculated using the measured absorption rate of stone before and after exposure to firing episodes. These firing episodes are meant to approximate the cultural use of these stones during prehistoric cooking episodes. The results of the experiment show that FAR may have some diagnostic capabilities to infer multiple firing episodes, confirm facility reuse, and support suggested mobility with respect to available resources and temporal episodes through accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dating and other analyses such as micro-botanical analysis...|$|E

The average indoor OC/EC ratios were 5. 8, 9. 1, and 5. 0 in roadside, urban, and rural areas, respectively; while average outdoor OC/EC ratios were 4. 0, 4. 3, and 4. 0, respectively. The average I/O ratios of 24 h PM 2. 5, OC, and EC were 1. 4, 1. 8, and 1. 2, respectively. High indoor-outdoor correlations (r 2) were found for PM 2. 5 EC (0. 96) and mass (0. 81), and low correlations were found for OC (0. 55), indicative of different organic carbon sources indoors. A simple model implied that about two-thirds of carbonaceous particles in indoor air are originated from outdoor sources. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|International audienceContinuous {{observation}} of atmospheric organic and elemental carbon (OC, EC) were conducted at Xi'an during high pollution seasons from September 2003 to February 2004. PM 2. 5 {{samples were collected}} on <b>pre-fired</b> quartz-fiber filters with battery-powered mini-volume samplers every day and PM 10 samples were collected every third days. Three types of source samples (i. e., coal-combustion, motor vehicle exhaust, and biomass burning) were also collected during ambient sampling period. Ambient and source samples were analyzed for OC and EC by thermal/optical reflectance (TOR) following the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) protocol. The average PM 2. 5 OC concentrations in fall and winter were 34. 1 ± 18. 0 µg m - 3 and 61. 9 ± 33. 2 µg m - 3, respectively, while EC were 11. 3 ± 6. 9 µg m - 3 and 12. 3 ± 5. 3 µg m - 3, respectively. Most of OC and EC were associated with fine particle (PM 2. 5) mode. The OC and EC levels at Xi'an are higher than most urban cities in Asia. The OC and EC in fall {{were found to be}} strongly correlated (R 2 > 0. 9), with moderate correlation in winter (R 2 = 0. 66). The carbonaceous aerosol accounted for 48. 8 ± 10. 1 % of the PM 2. 5 during fall and 45. 9 ± 7. 5 % during winter. Average OC/EC ratio was 3. 3 in fall and 5. 1 in winter with individual OC/EC ratios constantly exceeding 2. 0. Elevated OC/EC ratios were found during heating seasons with increased coal combustion. The contribution of secondary organic carbon was not significant during winter. The time series of OC and EC showed periodic variability. Traffic contributes 5 and 7 day peaks in the spectrum, precipitation appears as a 10 day periodicity and biomass burning can be identified as a 24 day periodicity. Total carbon (TC) was apportioned by absolute principal component analysis (APCA) using the 8 carbon fraction data (OC 1, OC 2, OC 3, OC 4, EC 1, EC 2, EC 3, and OP [a pyrolyzed carbon fraction]). TC attributes 73 % to gasoline exhaust, 23 % to diesel exhaust, and 4 % to biomass burning during fall. However, TC attributes 44 % each to gasoline exhaust and coal burning, 9 % to biomass burning, and 3 % to diesel exhaust during winter...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{reduction}} of fuel consumption has become an important issue in automotive industry. The BMW group focuses {{on the development of}} a high temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system as an auxiliary power unit (APU) for electrical power supply in addition to an enhanced efficiency of combustion engines to reach this target. SOFC development for APU applications primary focuses on the robustness of cells against mechanical and thermal stresses. Cells with porous metallic substrates made of ferritic FeCr-steels are expected to have high potential for satisfying this robustness conditions. The aim of this work was the fabrication of a composite, containing a porous metallic substrate and an anode made from nickel and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Different structures of substrates were fabricated from powders of the steel CroFer 22 APU using tape casting and sintering techniques. Subsequently, the chemical composition, structural parameters and the electric conductivity of these substrates were studied. The characterisation of high temperature corrosion resistance under typical anodic conditions of a solid oxide fuel cell was also an important aspect. The results were used to estimate an oxidation-dependent lifetime {{as a function of the}} specific surface area of a powder metallurgical substrate. Ni/YSZ-anodes were screen-printed and sintered on <b>pre-fired</b> CroFer 22 APU substrates. Variations of the Ni:YSZ ratio provided the determination of a minimum Ni content, needed to assure a continuous network for electrical conductivity. Interdiffusion of the elements Fe, Cr and Ni takes place, both, during sintering of the substrate/anode-unit and during cell operation. As a consequence, FeCr-oxides are formed in the anode. This leads to a loss in power density or even complete deterioration of the cell. Therefore, the integration of a diffusion barrier layer was another key issue of this work. $Cr_{ 2 }O_{ 3 }$, $Fe_{ 3 }O_{ 4 }$, doped LaCrO$_{ 3 }$, $Ce_{ 0, 8 }Gd_{ 0, 2 }O_{ 2 }$ and $CeO_{ 2 }$ were characterised regarding to their diffusion barrier efficiency and electrical conductivity. $CeO_{ 2 }$ shows the most promising properties of these materials. For electrochemical characterisation, substrate/anode-units containing a $CeO_{ 2 }$ diffusion barrier were coated with a 9. 5 YSZ electrolyte via vacuum-plasma-spraying technique being 60 μm in thickness. A powerful LSCF cathode was screen printed to complete the cells. At 800 °C a power density of 430 mW/cm$^{ 2 }$ was achieved. During 165 h operation at 0, 3 A/cm$^{ 2 }$, no significant voltage drop was observed...|$|E
40|$|Three aerosol {{sampling}} campaigns {{were conducted}} at two sites (i. e., Dar es Salaam and Morogoro) in Tanzania, during different seasons from May 2005 through May 2006. A Gent PM 10 stacked filter unit sampler with sequential Nuclepore polycarbonate filters, providing coarse (2 - 10 µm diameter) and fine (< 2 µm) size fractions, and PM 2. 5 and PM 10 tandem filter samplers with <b>pre-fired</b> quartz fibre filters were deployed. Depending upon {{the season and}} the location, either 24 -hour collections or separate daytime and nighttime samplings were performed. The samples were analysed for the particulate matter (PM) mass, total carbon (TC), organic carbon, elemental carbon, water-soluble organic carbon, black carbon, major inorganic cationic and anionic species, and 28 elements. Most aerosol components measured exhibited higher levels in the dry season campaign than in the wet season campaigns. Besides, the levels were higher at the kerbside of Dar es Salaam than at the rural site of Morogoro. The differences between the campaigns resulted from differences in meteorological conditions and anthropogenic sources. At Morogoro, the median levels of the PM 10 mass for the 2005 wet season, 2005 dry season, and 2006 wet season campaigns were 23, 45, and 13 µg/m 3 and at Dar es Salaam they were 46, 58, and 40 µg/m 3, respectively. In Morogoro, TC accounted, on average, for 31 % of the PM 10 mass in the 2005 wet season, for 27 % in the 2005 dry season, and for 33 % in the 2006 wet season. At Dar es Salaam TC represented 29 % of PM 10 mass in the 2005 dry season campaign, versus 37 % and 35 % in the 2005 and 2006 wet season campaigns, respectively. Aerosol chemical mass closure calculations indicated that organic matter and crustal matter were the dominant aerosol types in the PM 10 aerosol; at Dar es Salaam, they explained, on average, 37 % and 33 % of the PM mass, and at Morogoro 40 % and 36 %, respectively. Using non-crustal, non-sea-salt K as an indicator for biomass burning, the organic matter at Dar es Salaam was apportioned to its contributions from charcoal burning and traffic. It appeared that, on average, around 70 % originated from traffic versus 30 % from charcoal...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of the program was}} to optimize refractory materials and foundry processing used in casting steel. This objective was to be met by completing the following: (1) Surveying the steel foundries both through paper/electronic surveys sent to North American steel foundries as well as plant visits to participants. Information concerning refractory selection and performance as well as refractory and steelmaking practices provides a baseline for future comparison and to identify opportunities for substantial improvement in energy efficiency. (2) Conducting post-mortem analysis of materials from existing refractory/steelmaking practices to determine wear/failure mechanisms. (3) Identify areas for research on developing refractories for use in steel foundry furnaces, adjusting steelmaking practices to improve efficiency and modifying slag practices to improve refractory performance. The {{overall objective}} of the steel foundry refractory lining optimization program was to review established refractory and steelmaking practices to identify opportunities for improvements that would yield substantial energy savings for steel foundries. Energy savings were expected to arise from improved efficiency of the electric arc furnaces and from reductions in the post-casting welding and grinding that are normally required. Ancillary energy savings related to a reduction in the amount of refractories currently produced {{to meet the needs of}} the steel foundry industry, and a shift from <b>pre-fired</b> materials (shaped refractories) to monolithic refractories that are heat treated ''in situ'' were anticipated. A review of the complete program results indicates that techniques for achieving the overall goal were demonstrated. The main difference between the predicted and the actual achievements relates to the areas from which actual energy savings could be realized. Although reductions in furnace tap temperature would result in a reduction in the power required for melting, such reductions are realized through changes within the ladle transfer portion of the process, through modified ladle pre-heat and refractory insulation. Reductions in clean room energy usage proved very difficult to track, and some questions as to just how much impact refractory related inclusions have on the degree of welding and grinding required for completion of a casting, remain. Post-mortem analysis of casting defects did identify refractory derived inclusions but the greatest concentration of inclusions related to steel reoxidation issue. In almost every instance, the suggested refractory/process modifications were proven to be both technically and economically feasible. The difficulty in implementation of the proposed changes relates to the ''up front'' expense and the learning curve associated with any process modification. These two issues were compounded by production slow downs that are too common in the current market. Such slow downs normally result in less energy efficient processing coupled with reductions in capital or ''up front'' expenditures. A return to historical norms should allow foundries to implement the suggested modifications and then evaluate the overall benefit...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Carbonaceous aerosol {{components}} which {{consist of}} organic compounds (OC) and black carbon (BC) {{account for a}} large fraction of atmospheric particulate matter. Most information available on the abundance, properties, and effects of these components so far is based on measurement data of total carbon (TC = OC + BC). This data is increasingly complemented by measurements of water soluble organic carbon (WSOC), its macromolecular fraction (MWSOC), and individual organic compounds due to its environmental significance. WSOC are usually highly polar, oxygenated compounds containing two or more COOH, C=O and/or OH functional groups such as hydroxyamines, amino acids, polyalcohols, sugars, dicarboxylic acids, ketocarboxylic acids and dicarbonyls. These compounds contribute {{to the ability of}} particles to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and dicarboxylic acids especially can potentially affect the global climate by scattering incoming solar radiation, which counteracts the global warming caused by the increase of greenhouse gases. According to literature the burning of cellulose (biomass burning) generates smoke particles that were nearly 100 % watersoluble. The Vaal Triangle was recently declared as the first priority area in South Africa by the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism on the 21 st of April 2006. The area comprises of heavy industrial activities, one power station, several commercial operations, motor vehicles as well as many households utilizing coal as an energy source. Ambient aerosol sampling for this study was done at 3 sites in the Vaal Triangle (Vereeniging, Vanderbijlpark and Sasolburg) during the winter of 2006 and summer of 2007 with Mini-volume portable air samplers. Aerosol samples were collected on <b>pre-fired</b> quartz filters. Gas and Ion chromatography were applied in analyzing the aerosol filters for specific dicarboxylic acids in the WSOC fraction. However, the GC-MS method required the water extracted samples to be derivatized before injection. This multiple synthesis pathway proved difficult and errors prone with potential dicarboxylic acid loss since the dicarboxylic acids are present in ng/m 3. This meant the GC-MS was only used as a quantitative technique. An alternative ion chromatographic method of analyzing dicarboxylic acids was developed. A new Dionex ICS- 3000 RFIC instrument along with its special licensed software (Virtual Column) was utilized. The Virtual Column software makes it possible to simulate possible separations of predetermined individual compounds within the WSOC fraction. The influence and impact of various parameters can be checked without wasting valuable sample. After a method was developed, it was tested practically by analyzing standard solutions. The optimized method was then used to analyze the field samples collected at the different sites. The ICS- 3000 RFIC with Virtual Column proved to be a convenient and appropriate technique. It showed that the dicarboxylic acid species oxalic, malonic, succinic, glutaric and phthalic as well as inorganic ions fluoride, chloride, nitrate and sulphate were present in the air of all the sites. The chromatographic profile of all the sites also closely resembled each other, be they residential, industrial or petrochemical. However, the methodology was only developed for qualitative analysis and further studies should develop the method further to include quantitative analysis as well. Master...|$|E
