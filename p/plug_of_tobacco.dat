60|$|I {{decided to}} give the redoubtable Peg some apples from my {{birthday}} tree, and Dan declared he would give her a <b>plug</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco.</b>|$|E
60|$|This last {{addition}} to my stock caused a considerable protuberance in front, which I abated in a measure by shaking {{the bits of}} bread around my waist, and distributing the <b>plugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> among {{the folds of the}} garment.|$|R

There is the keg of powder, the bar <b>of</b> lead, ten <b>plugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco,</b> the cloth for the squaws, and all the other things agreed on." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I left me <b>plug</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> {{here when}} I was coiling down last," [...] said the little twisted man--no; {{he did not}} say it. He spat it out like so much venom.|$|E
60|$|It {{was curious}} to note {{at this point}} how every seaman in that boat became {{suddenly}} sympathetic and wide awake, and took to hasty, anxious examination of all his pockets--vest jacket, and trousers. The result was {{the discovery of a}} good many clay pipes, more or less blackened and shortened, with a few <b>plugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco,</b> but not a single match, either fusee or congreve. The men looked at each other with something akin to despair.|$|R
60|$|In {{a quarter}} of an hour the {{articles}} that had been mentioned as missing were returned; and, in order to restore harmony, several <b>plugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> and a few additional trinkets were returned by the messenger. Soon after, the dogs were harnessed, the sledges packed, and, with many protestations of good-will on both sides, the parties separated. A few cracks of their long whips--a few answering howls from the dogs--and the Esquimaux were off and out of sight, leaving the Dolphin in her former solitude under the shadow of the frowning cliffs.|$|R

6000|$|Now, {{one of the}} {{favorite}} pursuits of sailors during a dogwatch below at sea is cards; and though {{they do not understand}} whist, cribbage, and games of that kidney, yet they are adepts at what is called [...] "High-low- Jack-and-the-game," [...] which name, indeed, has a Jackish and nautical flavor. Their stakes are generally so many <b>plugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco,</b> which, like rouleaux of guineas, are piled on their chests when they play. Judge, then, the wicked zest with which the Highlander's crew now shuffled and dealt the pack; and how the interest curiously and invertedly increased, as the stakes necessarily became less and less; and finally resolved themselves into [...] "chaws." ...|$|R

"Not {{until after}} the election," [...] said the tall man, cutting a corner off his <b>plug</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco.</b> [...] "I've been in your city {{long enough to know}} {{something}} about your mobs. The motorman's mob is about the least dangerous of them all, except the National Guard and the Dressmakers' Convention.|$|E
60|$|The hand {{he thrust}} {{into his pocket}} came out through the bottom of it, for {{the lower part of}} the jacket was torn and burned; but one of the others {{produced}} a <b>plug</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco,</b> and when he had lighted his pipe Weston leaned back somewhat limply against the side of the adit.|$|E
50|$|The Finzers sold Burley leaf <b>tobacco</b> in sixteen-ounce <b>plugs</b> <b>of</b> navy <b>tobacco.</b> Their other brands {{included}} Jolly Tar, Five Brothers, and Pastime.

60|$|The shanty was cheerfully lighted and cosily warm. Nasmyth {{had slept}} soundly {{there on the}} springy spruce-twigs, and {{there was at least}} {{abundance}} when the mealtimes came round. Now he was about to be cast adrift again to face a three days' march in the open, under the bitter frost, and what might await him {{at the end of it}} he did not know. At length, the meal was cleared away, and when the pipes were lighted, he told his comrades that he was going. They were not demonstrative in their expressions of regret, but they thrust upon him little <b>plugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco,</b> which could not well be replaced there, and several of them told him that, if he struck nothing he liked better, all he had to do was to present himself at this ranch or the other beside blue lake or frothing river when they went back in the spring. What was more to the purpose, they meant it.|$|R
50|$|Known {{for quality}} {{products}} {{and with good}} relations to area businessmen, the brothers built up the business and incorporated in 1882.

60|$|For {{a moment}} neither spoke. The Angel looked about {{him with a}} face that grew pale. The Doctor {{extracted}} a <b>plug</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> from his pipe and flung it away, shut his penknife {{and put it in}} his waistcoat pocket. He had not meant to speak quite so emphatically, but speech always warmed him.|$|E
6000|$|... "And why shouldn't I?" [...] he {{suddenly}} yelled, his eyes gleaming and his whole satanic nature reasserting itself. [...] "We {{were bound to}} swing, one and all, and they were none the worse if I saved myself by turning against them. Every man for himself, say I, and the devil take the luckiest. You haven't a <b>plug</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco,</b> doctor, have you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I popped {{it right}} back in again," [...] said Carl. [...] "It didn't hurt anybody--a poor little frog! And I wish old Jane Drew WOULD give up our class. I hate her. Her own nephew had a dirty <b>plug</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> {{in his pocket and}} offered us fellows a chew when Elder Clow was praying. I guess that's worse than a frog." ...|$|E

25|$|By the 1850s, Lynchburg (along with New Bedford, Massachusetts) {{was among}} the richest towns per capita in the US.

60|$|And when {{later in}} the evening the brother of the {{beautiful}} girl borrowed Mr. Sapling's tennis racket, and his bicycle for a fortnight, and the father of the beautiful girl got Sapling to endorse his note for a couple of hundreds, and her uncle Zephas borrowed his bedroom candle and used his razor to cut up a <b>plug</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco,</b> Mr. Sapling felt proud to be acquainted with the family.|$|E
60|$|Tom {{followed}} his own advice by accepting {{a dish of}} soup, with a large lump of meat in it, which {{was at that moment}} offered to him by the old chief who also urged Ned Sinton to partake; but he declined, and, lighting his pipe, proceeded to enjoy a smoke, at the same time handing the old man a <b>plug</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco,</b> which he accepted promptly, and began to use forthwith.|$|E
60|$|The priest {{turned his}} feverish eyes piercingly upon his {{companion}} {{for a few}} seconds, and then doggedly fixed them upon the ground. Cranch drew a <b>plug</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> from his pocket, cut off a portion, placed it in his cheek, and then quietly began to strap the blade of his jack-knife upon his boot. Father Pedro saw it from under his eyelids, and even in his preoccupation despised him.|$|E

Some types <b>of</b> <b>plug</b> may either be chewed or smoked in a tobacco pipe, and some are exclusive to one method of consumption or the other.|$|R

Except the two years that I came ashore for the King Philip business, when every man that could carry a gun was needed on the border, I've never been three casts of a biscuit from salt water, and I tell you that I never knew a better crossing than the one we have just made." ...|$|R
50|$|After leaving Congress, {{he moved}} to Mattoon, Illinois, and became {{interested}} in the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>plug</b> <b>tobacco,</b> in which he worked for ten years as a wholesale tobacco merchant.
