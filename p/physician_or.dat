25|$|In {{health-related}} fields, {{a reference}} range or reference interval is {{the range of}} values for a physiologic measurement in healthy persons (for example, the amount of creatinine in the blood, or the partial pressure of oxygen). It is a basis for comparison (a frame of reference) for a <b>physician</b> <b>or</b> other health professional to interpret a set of test results for a particular patient. Some important reference ranges in medicine are reference ranges for blood tests and reference ranges for urine tests.|$|E
25|$|ALS {{units are}} more likely to be based in large centers, {{are more likely}} to be staffed by paid, hospital-based personnel, and are {{commonly}} composed of a physician (usually an emergency <b>physician</b> <b>or</b> anesthetist) and a critical care nurse. ALS units can be found either on emergency response vehicles (automedica) or on intensive care ambulances. Some areas use a modified approach to ALS, with a volunteer crew supplemented by an emergency nurse who is permitted to perform some ALS procedures.|$|E
25|$|An Independent Practice Association is a {{legal entity}} that {{contracts}} {{with a group of}} physicians to provide service to the HMO's members. Most often, the physicians are paid on a basis of capitation, which in this context means a set amount for each enrolled person assigned to that <b>physician</b> <b>or</b> group of physicians, whether or not that person seeks care. The contract is not usually exclusive so individual doctors or the group may sign contracts with multiple HMOs. Physicians who participate in IPAs usually also serve fee-for-service patients not associated with managed care.|$|E

In some {{regions of the world}} nurses are the primary healthcare worker that provides emergency medical services. In European countries such as France or Italy, also use nurses as a means of providing ALS services. These nurses may work under the direct supervision of a <b>physician,</b> <b>or,</b> in rarer cases, independently. In some places in Europe, notably Norway, paramedics do exist, but the role of the 'ambulance nurse' continues to be developed, as it is felt that nurses may bring unique skills to some situations encountered by ambulance crews.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{treatment}} of infertility generally {{involves the use}} of fertility medication, medical device, surgery, or a combination of the following. If the sperm are of good quality and the mechanics of the woman's reproductive structures are good (patent fallopian tubes, no adhesions or scarring), a course of ovarian stimulating medication maybe used. The <b>physician</b> <b>or</b> WHNP may also suggest using a conception cap cervical cap, which the patient uses at home by placing the sperm inside the cap and putting the conception device on the cervix, or intrauterine insemination (IUI), in which the doctor or WHNP introduces sperm into the uterus during ovulation, via a catheter. In these methods, fertilization occurs inside the body.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{and their}} parents must receive psychotherapy, which should include {{marriage}} counselling. Mitigation of lasting psychological problems, including depression secondary to chronic illness and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), can be very successfully addressed with early interventions. This care may come from the family <b>physician,</b> <b>or</b> other attending physician, whoever is more appropriate; specialist care is generally not required. Lewis and Vitulano (2003) note several studies suggesting predisposal for psychopathology in paediatric patients with chronic illness. Esch (2002) advocates preventive psychiatry supports to facilitate balance {{of positive and negative}} stressors associated with chronic physical pathology. Patients with FSS should have pre-emptive and ongoing mixed cognitive therapy-psychodynamic psychotherapy for patients with FSS and cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), if begun after onset of obvious pathology.|$|E

The same is true of state boards run by physicians from that state; board <b>physicians</b> <b>or</b> <b>physicians</b> unaffiliated with the board may be in medical peer review committees.|$|R
