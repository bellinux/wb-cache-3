5|$|A {{few weeks}} after the duel, Parlement awarded Carrouges a further six {{thousand}} livres in gold and a <b>position</b> <b>within</b> the Royal Household. Such rewards enabled Carrouge to begin further legal action, attempting to exert his earlier claim to Arnou-le-Faucon. However, this land which Carrouges so coveted remained beyond his reach. Count Pierre, who held the land, never forgave Carrouges the death of his favourite, and held the estates from him in court.|$|E

5|$|According to Takahashi, the inamyloid spores, the diverticulate cap cuticle hyphae, and {{the dark}} pigment in the gill hyphae suggest that the fungus is best {{classified}} in the section Hiemales of the genus Mycena. Because of its medium-sized, partly collybioid fruit bodies (i.e., small to medium-sized with white spore prints and convex caps, similar to species once placed in the genus Collybia), the white cord-like rhizomorphs, and its distinctly intervenose gills, it has an isolated <b>position</b> <b>within</b> the section.|$|E
5|$|Although heavy {{industry}} died {{out in the}} area during the early twentieth century, as part of Scotland's densely populated Central Belt, Giffnock has continued to grow as a dormitory town, supported by its <b>position</b> <b>within</b> the Greater Glasgow area, from roughly 1,425 residents {{in the early twentieth}} century to 16,178 in 2001. Expansion continues due to several new housing developments; however, much of the land is now urbanised or designated parkland, leaving little room for further expansion.|$|E
5|$|By 1970 these {{differences}} {{had not been}} resolved, and Brezhnev postponed the 24th Party Congress and the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1971–1975). The delay in resolving these issues led to rumours circulating in Soviet society that Kosygin, or even Brezhnev, would lose their posts to Podgorny. By March 1971 {{it became apparent that}} Brezhnev was the leader of the country, with Kosygin as the spokesman of the five-year plan and Podgorny's <b>position</b> <b>within</b> the collective leadership strengthened.|$|E

5|$|By the late-1960s, Hồ's declining health had {{weakened}} his <b>position</b> <b>within</b> the leadership. While Hồ {{was still}} consulted on important decisions, Lê Duẩn dominated the Party. When Hồ died on 2 September 1969, the collective leadership he had espoused continued, but Lê Duẩn was first among equals. The Central Committee's first resolution following Hồ's death pledged {{to uphold the}} collective leadership. Lê Duẩn chaired Hồ's funeral committee and gave the event's final speech.|$|E
5|$|During {{the colonial}} period, present-day Argentina offered fewer {{economic}} advantages {{compared to other}} parts of the Spanish Empire such as Mexico or Peru, which caused it to assume a peripheral <b>position</b> <b>within</b> the Spanish colonial economy.

5|$|Furthermore, the {{political}} climate {{in the aftermath of}} Elagabalus' reign, as well as Dio's own <b>position</b> <b>within</b> the government of Alexander likely influenced the truth of this part of his history for the worse. Dio regularly refers to Elagabalus as Sardanapalus, partly to distinguish him from his divine namesake, but chiefly to do his part in maintaining the damnatio memoriae and to associate him with another autocrat notorious for a dissolute life.|$|E

5|$|As the {{northern}} tribal lands gradually opened to white settlement, Indiana's population rapidly increased {{and the center}} of population shifted continually northward. Indianapolis was selected to be the site of the new state capital in 1820 because of its central <b>position</b> <b>within</b> the state. The city founders assumed the White River would serve as a major transportation artery; however, the waterway was too sandy for navigation. In 1825, Indianapolis replaced Corydon as the seat of government. The government became established in the Marion County Courthouse as the second state capital building.|$|E
