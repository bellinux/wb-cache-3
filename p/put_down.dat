5|$|In 77 BC, {{the senate}} sent one of Sulla's former lieutenants, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great"), to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> an {{uprising}} in Hispania. By 71 BC, Pompey returned to Rome after having completed his mission. Around the same time, another of Sulla's former lieutenants, Marcus Licinius Crassus, had just <b>put</b> <b>down</b> the Spartacus-led gladiator/slave revolt in Italy. Upon their return, Pompey and Crassus found the populares party fiercely attacking Sulla's constitution. They attempted to forge {{an agreement with}} the populares party. If both Pompey and Crassus were elected consul in 70 BC, they would dismantle the more obnoxious components of Sulla's constitution. The two were soon elected, and quickly dismantled most of Sulla's constitution.|$|E

5|$|A {{measure of}} William's success in taking control is that, from 1072 until the Capetian conquest of Normandy in 1204, William and his successors were largely {{absentee}} rulers. For example, after 1072, William {{spent more than}} 75 per cent {{of his time in}} France rather than England. While he needed to be personally present in Normandy to defend the realm from foreign invasion and <b>put</b> <b>down</b> internal revolts, he set up royal administrative structures that enabled him to rule England from a distance.|$|E
5|$|American {{black bears}} were a common {{attraction}} by the 1930s, but in 1929 alone 81people required treatment for bear-related injuries. Troublesome bears were marked with white paint before being relocated {{to other parts}} of the park, and repeat offenders were killed. Bear feeding shows were stopped in 1940, but the Park Service continued to kill bears that habitually raided camps; 200 were <b>put</b> <b>down</b> between 1960 and 1972. Park visitors are now educated about proper food storage.|$|E

With a strength of 60,000 professional soldiers, the Romans quickly swept across Galilee and by 69 marched on Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|He {{argued against}} funding to build Washington, D.C.'s infrastructure, stating {{that it was}} unfair to expect state {{citizens}} {{to pay for the}} city's streets, even if it was the seat of government.

5|$|In 1869–70, present-day Winnipeg was {{the site}} of the Red River Rebellion, a {{conflict}} between the local provisional government of Métis, led by Louis Riel, and newcomers from eastern Canada. General Garnet Wolseley was sent to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> the uprising. The Manitoba Act of 1870 made Manitoba the fifth province of the three-year-old Canadian Confederation. On 8 November 1873, Winnipeg was incorporated as a city, with the Selkirk settlement as its nucleus. Métis legislator and interpreter James McKay named the city.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 and 1921, local {{opposition}} to requisitioning resulted in anti-Bolshevik peasant uprisings breaking out across Russia, which were suppressed. Among {{the most significant}} was the Tambov Rebellion, which was <b>put</b> <b>down</b> by the Red Army. In February 1921, workers went on strike in Petrograd, resulting in the government proclaiming martial law {{in the city and}} sending in the Red Army to quell demonstrations. In March, the Kronstadt rebellion began when sailors in Kronstadt revolted against the Bolshevik government, demanding that all socialists be allowed to publish freely, that independent trade unions be given freedom of assembly and that peasants be allowed free markets and not be subject to requisitioning. Lenin declared that the mutineers had been misled by the Socialist Revolutionaries and foreign imperialists, calling for violent reprisals. Under Trotsky's leadership, the Red Army <b>put</b> <b>down</b> the rebellion on 17 March, resulting in thousands of deaths and the internment of survivors in labour camps.|$|E

If both Pompey and Crassus were elected Consul in 70 BC, they would dismantle the more obnoxious components of Sulla's constitution. The promise of both Pompey and Crassus, aided by the presence of both of their armies outside of the gates of Rome, helped to 'persuade' the populares to elect the two to the Consulship. As soon as they were elected, they dismantled most of Sulla's constitution.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the French Revolution, groups of royalists loyal to the House of Bourbon rose up against the new government. One group was the Chouans of Brittany, led by Jean Chouan.

The insurrection was <b>put</b> <b>down</b> by the republic, and within two years the royalist forces had been routed.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous {{resistance}} was stubborn, and Montejo {{did not complete}} the conquest of western and central Honduras until 1539.
