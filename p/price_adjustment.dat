40|$|Since price changes {{associated}} with a trader’s own trading activities can be a significant component of trading costs, we contrast this aspect of market liquidity across the major exchanges. Examining firms which change exchange listings, we find that <b>price</b> <b>adjustments</b> to trading activity are quite gradual on the Nasdaq while almost instantaneous on the NYSE. In fact, <b>price</b> <b>adjustments</b> over very short horizons are about 12 basis points greater on the NYSE than the Nasdaq, whereas <b>price</b> <b>adjustments</b> over longer horizons are about 7 basis points lower on the NYSE. These differences are more pronounced for large trades than for small trades- the short horizon adjustment is about 45 basis points greater on the NYSE for trades of at least 10, 000 shares. On average, it takes about an hour for prices on the Nasdaq to fully adjust to trading activity. In a model of price formation which acknowledges partial <b>price</b> <b>adjustments,</b> we find the half life of a Nasdaq trade’s price impact is about 7 trades versus less than one trade on the NYSE.

50|$|Price adjustments, {{also called}} price protection, is a retail {{practice}} in the USA in which customers can obtain a partial refund {{of the purchase price}} of an item if they can show it on sale at a lower price within a fixed time frame. In such circumstances, retailers will do a “price adjustment,” refunding the difference between the price the customer paid and the price now available. For example, if a customer buys a TV from for $300, and it drops in price by $100, they can go back to the retailer to ask for a <b>price</b> <b>adjustment</b> and get the difference returned to them, often in cash.
