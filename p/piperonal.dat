2500|$|There are {{numerous}} methods available to synthesize MDMA via different intermediates. The original MDMA synthesis described in Merck's patent involves brominating safrole to 1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-bromopropane and then reacting this adduct with methylamine. Most illicit MDMA is synthesized using MDP2P (3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone) as a precursor. MDP2P {{in turn is}} generally synthesized from <b>piperonal,</b> safrole or isosafrole. [...] One method is to isomerize safrole to isosafrole {{in the presence of}} a strong base, and then oxidize isosafrole to MDP2P. Another method uses the Wacker process to oxidize safrole directly to the MDP2P intermediate with a palladium catalyst. Once the MDP2P intermediate has been prepared, a reductive amination leads to racemic MDMA (an equal parts mixture of (R)-MDMA and (S)-MDMA). Relatively small quantities of essential oil are required to make large amounts of MDMA. The essential oil of Ocotea cymbarum, for example, typically contains between 80 and 94% safrole. This allows 500ml of the oil to produce between 150 and 340 grams of MDMA.|$|E

50|$|<b>Piperonal,</b> {{like all}} aldehydes, {{can be reduced}} to its alcohol (piperonyl alcohol) or {{oxidized}} to give its acid (piperonylic acid).|$|E
50|$|It is a {{precursor}} in {{the synthesis of}} the insecticide synergist piperonyl butoxide, the fragrance <b>piperonal</b> via isosafrole, and the empathogenic/entactogenic drug MDMA.|$|E
50|$|Reaction of piperic acid {{with strong}} oxidizers such as {{potassium}} permanganate or ozone, or a halogen such as bromine followed by sodium hydroxide causes oxidative cleavage of the double-bonds, yielding <b>piperonal</b> and piperonylic acid. <b>Piperonal</b> has many uses in industry and {{is itself a}} precursor to a good subsection of other chemicals. On reduction with sodium amalgam piperic acid forms α- and β-dihydropiperic acid, C12H12O4, and the latter can take up two further atoms of hydrogen to produce tetrahydropiperic acid.|$|E

50|$|Heliotropin (also {{known as}} <b>Piperonal),</b> an extract of the Sassafras tree, {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of perfumes, soaps and body lotions. Natural Heliotropin is obtained from Sassafras oil which is extracted from the roots of the Sassafras tree, a species of deciduous trees in the family Lauraceae. The massive commercial felling of Sassafras forests has led to the danger of extinction of the species. It is estimated that around 5 million trees are cut down every year to meet the worldwide demand for Heliotropin.The Anthea Group through its in-house research developed a synthetic grade of Heliotropin having a high purity, and has set up manufacturing facilities in Group company, Crown Chemicals. Synthetic <b>Piperonal</b> manufactured in Crown Chemicals is widely used in Fragrance, Flavour and Pharmaceutical applications.|$|E
50|$|<b>Piperonal</b> can be {{prepared}} by oxidizing isosafrole or by using a multistep sequence from catechol or 1,2-methylenedioxybenzene. Synthesis from the latter chemical is accomplished through a condensation reaction with glyoxylic acid followed by cleaving the resulting α-hydroxy acid with an oxidizing agent. Synthesis from catechol requires an additional step, Williamson ether synthesis using dichloromethane.|$|E
50|$|Piperic acid is a {{chemical}} often {{obtained by the}} base-hydrolysis of the alkaloid piperine from black pepper, followed by acidification of the corresponding salt. Piperic acid is an intermediate in the synthesis of other compounds such as <b>piperonal,</b> and as-such {{may be used to}} produce fragrances, perfumes flavorants and drugs as well as other useful compounds.|$|E
50|$|Safrole {{is listed}} as a Table I {{precursor}} under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.Due to {{its role in the}} manufacture of MDMA, safrole and isosafrole, as well as <b>piperonal,</b> are Category I precursors under regulation No 273/2004 of the European Community.

5000|$|The tree is {{of special}} concern, {{as it is}} being {{harvested}} at a high rate to obtain safrole, a precursor to the pesticide synergist piperonyl butoxide, the flavorant and fragrance <b>piperonal,</b> and the psychoactive drug MDMA. Much of this illicit harvesting {{is happening in the}} Cardamom Mountains and Botum Sakor National Park in Cambodia at the moment. The documentary film [...] "Forest of ecstasy" [...] (Vanguard 2009) is investigating the subject on location.|$|E
50|$|<b>Piperonal</b> has {{a floral}} odor which is {{commonly}} {{described as being}} {{similar to that of}} vanillin or cherry. For this reason it commonly used in fragrances and artificial flavors. The compound was named Heliotropin after the 'cherry pie' notes found in the heliotrope flower's fragrance (even though the chemical is not present in the flower's true aroma). Perfumers began to use the fragrance for the first time by the early 1880s. It is commonly used to add vanilla or almond nuances, generally imparting balsamic, powdery, and floral aspects to a scent's character.|$|E
50|$|Fritz Haber {{successfully}} {{passed his}} examinations at the St. Elizabeth High School in Breslau in September 1886. Although his father wished him to apprentice in the dye company, Fritz obtained his father's permission to study chemistry, at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin (today the Humboldt University of Berlin), {{with the director}} of the Institute for Chemistry, A. W. Hofmann. Haber was disappointed by his initial winter semester (1886-87) in Berlin, and arranged to attend the University of Heidelberg for the summer semester of 1887, where he studied under Robert Bunsen. He then returned to Berlin, to the Technical College of Charlottenburg (today the Technical University of Berlin). In the summer of 1889 he left university to perform a legally required year of voluntary service in the Sixth Field Artillery Regiment. Upon its completion, he returned to Charlottenburg where he became a student of Carl Liebermann. In addition to Liebermann's lectures on organic chemistry, Haber also attended lectures by Otto Witt on the chemical technology of dyes. Liebermann assigned Haber to work on reactions with <b>piperonal</b> for his thesis topic, published as Über einige Derivate des piperonals (About a Few <b>piperonal</b> Derivatives) in 1891. Haber received his doctorate cum laude from Friedrich Wilhelm University in May 1891, after presenting his work to a board of examiners from the University of Berlin, since Charlottenburg was not yet accredited to grant doctorates.|$|E
5000|$|The {{effects of}} substituents on the diazoalkanes is {{reversed}} {{relative to the}} carbonyl reactants: electron-withdrawing substituents decrease the rate of reaction while electron-donating substituents accelerate it. For example, diazomethane is significantly more reactive than ethyl diazoacetate, though less reactive than its higher alkyl homologs (e.g. diazoethane). [...] Reaction conditions may also affect the yields of carbonyl product and epoxide product. In the reactions of o-nitrobenzaldehyde, p-nitrobenzaldehyde, [...] and phenylacetaldehyde with diazomethane, the ratio of epoxide to carbonyl is increased by the inclusion of methanol in the reaction mixture. The opposite influence has also been observed in the reaction of <b>piperonal</b> with diazomethane, which exhibits increased carbonyl yield {{in the presence of}} methanol.|$|E
5000|$|Approximately 50% of {{synthetic}} catechol is {{consumed in the}} production of pesticides, the remainder being used as a precursor to fine chemicals such as perfumes and pharmaceuticals. It is a common building block in organic synthesis. [...] Several industrially significant flavors and fragrances are prepared starting from catechol. Guaiacol is prepared by methylation of catechol and is then converted to vanillin on a scale of about 10M kg per year (1990). The related monoethyl ether of catechol, guethol, is converted to ethylvanillin, a component of chocolate confectioneries. 3-Trans-Isocamphylcyclohexanol, widely used as a replacement for sandalwood oil, is prepared from catechol via guaiacol and camphor. <b>Piperonal,</b> a flowery scent, is prepared from the methylene diether of catechol followed by condensation with glyoxal and decarboxylation.|$|E
50|$|Vanilla essence {{occurs in}} two forms. Real seedpod extract is an {{extremely}} complicated mixture of several hundred different compounds, including vanillin, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, furfural, hexanoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, eugenol, methyl cinnamate, and isobutyric acid. Synthetic essence consists of a solution of synthetic vanillin in ethanol. The chemical compound vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde) is {{a major contributor to}} the characteristic flavor and aroma of real vanilla, but hundreds of compounds contribute to a complex flavor that vanillin can only approximate. Another minor component of vanilla extract is <b>piperonal</b> (heliotropin). Vanillin was first isolated from vanilla pods by Gobley in 1858. By 1874, it had been obtained from glycosides of pine tree sap, temporarily causing a depression in the natural vanilla industry. Vanillin can be easily synthesized from various raw materials, but the majority of food-grade (>99% pure) vanillin is made from guaiacol. Lower priced milk chocolate, cream, cookies and other desserts often use artificial vanillin in place of natural vanilla.|$|E

40|$|Background. Many {{families}} find {{regular checking}} of children’s heads for head louse infestation too onerous and {{would prefer to}} be able to prevent infestation by use of a topical application that deters lice from infesting the head. Identification in the laboratory of a repellent activity for <b>piperonal</b> provided the basis for developing a spray product to repel lice. Methods. A proof of principle field study in Dhaka, Bangladesh, compared the effect of using 2 % <b>piperonal</b> spray with that of a placebo in 105 children and adults from three communities with infestation levels close to 100 %. All participants were treated for infestation and subsequent incidence of reinfestation monitored daily by investigators. A second randomised, controlled, double blind, study in North London, UK, evaluated the effect of the product in normal use. One hundred and sixty-three children from schools with a high level (20 – 25 %) of infestation were treated and confirmed louse free and randomly divided between 2 % <b>piperonal,</b> a placebo spray, and a control group for up to 22 weeks. Parents applied the spray and monitored for infestation. Regular investigator visits confirmed the parental monitoring and replenished supplies of spray. Results. In Dhaka, over 18 days there were only 4 infestations in the <b>piperonal</b> group and 8 in the placebo group. This difference was not significant (p = 0. 312). In North London, there were 41 cases of infestation {{over the course of the}} study. Although there were fewer infestations in the <b>piperonal</b> group, analysis of time to first infestation showed a no significant (p = 0. 4368) difference between groups. Conclusion. Routine use of 2 % <b>piperonal</b> spray in communities with a high prevalence of head louse infestation may provide some protection from infestation. However, the difference between use of the product and no active intervention was sufficiently small that regular checking for presence of lice is likely to be a more practical and cost effective approach to prevention of infestation...|$|E
