25|$|The {{study of}} motion {{can be divided}} into {{kinematics}} and dynamics. Direct kinematics refers to the calculation of end effector position, orientation, velocity, and acceleration when the corresponding joint values are known. Inverse kinematics refers to the opposite case in which required joint values are calculated for given end effector values, as done in <b>path</b> <b>planning.</b> Some special aspects of kinematics include handling of redundancy (different possibilities of performing the same movement), collision avoidance, and singularity avoidance. Once all relevant positions, velocities, and accelerations have been calculated using kinematics, methods from the field of dynamics are used to study the effect of forces upon these movements. Direct dynamics refers to the calculation of accelerations in the robot once the applied forces are known. Direct dynamics is used in computer simulations of the robot. Inverse dynamics refers to the calculation of the actuator forces necessary to create a prescribed end-effector acceleration. This information can be used to improve the control algorithms of a robot.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method to {{generate}} strategic team AI pathfinding plans for computer games and simulations using probabilistic pathfinding. This method {{is inspired by}} genetic algorithms (Russell and Norvig, 2002), in that, a fitness function is {{used to test the}} quality of the <b>path</b> <b>plans.</b> The method generates high-quality <b>path</b> <b>plans</b> by eliminating the low-quality ones. The <b>path</b> <b>plans</b> are generated by probabilistic pathfinding, and the elimination is done by a fitness test of the <b>path</b> <b>plans.</b> This <b>path</b> <b>plan</b> generation method has the ability to generate variation or different high-quality paths, which is desired for games to increase replay values. This work is an extension of our earlier work on team AI: probabilistic pathfinding (John et al., 2006). We explore ways to combine probabilistic pathfinding and genetic algorithm to create a new method to generate strategic team AI pathfinding plans...|$|R
40|$|This thesis will {{compare the}} {{performance}} of the Challenge 1 unmanned surface vehicle when autonomously conducting a radiological survey of a bounded, obstacle free, convex polygon via a traditional raster scan versus a novel spiral-like <b>path</b> <b>plan.</b> Currently, unmanned ground vehicles (UGV), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), and unmanned surface vehicles (USV) use a simple raster scan to insure complete coverage of a predefined, obstacle free area. Raster scans require a 180 degree change in heading which is easy for tracked UGVs and vertical take-o_ UAVs to accomplish, but more difficult for marine vehicles and fixed winged UAVs. A spiral-like <b>path</b> <b>plan</b> will not completely eliminate turns close to 180 degrees, but presents the possibility of removing the number of sharp turns at the expense of adding more slight turns. The author of this thesis originally hypothesized that this spiral-like <b>path</b> <b>plan</b> would result in shorter autonomous surveys by the Challenge 1 USV, as well as a higher percentage of coverage. Shorter surveys will allow operators such as the mission specialist overseeing a disaster in which radiological material may be present or treaty verification inspectors searching a facility to conduct more surveys in a limited time, which therefore increases the total area searched over this time period as well as provides data to the mission specialist faster. A higher percentage of coverage attained by the spiral-like <b>path</b> <b>plan</b> would guarantee a more complete representation of the area surveyed. To test this hypothesis the author used the 1. 15 acre pond at John Crompton Park in College Station, Texas, to generate twenty-five unique convex polygons via teleoperation of the Challenge 1, ranging in size from 450 square meters to 1027 square meters, to which a raster <b>path</b> <b>plan</b> and spiral-like <b>path</b> <b>plan</b> were each used by the Challenge 1 to survey the area, resulting in fifty total runs. Following the data collection, the associated log from each run was used to calculate total survey time, total survey distance, root mean square of cross-track error, Hausdorff Distance (max RMS error), percent coverage, and percent of survey locations inside the bounded convex polygon. The average survey time for a spiral like <b>path</b> <b>plan</b> versus a raster scan was 13. 68 seconds shorter (p < : 59). The average total distance for a raster path versus a spiral like path was 15. 53 meters less (p < : 061). The average RMS of cross-track error for a spiral like <b>path</b> <b>plan</b> versus a spiral <b>path</b> <b>plan</b> was 0. 31 meters less (p < : 123). The average Hausdorff Distance for a spiral like <b>path</b> <b>plan</b> versus a raster scan was 1. 53 meters less (p < 0 : 0005). The average of percent coverage for a raster scan versus a spiral like path was 4 : 22 % higher (p < 0 : 027). The average of percentage of locations in the bounding area for a raster path versus a spiral like path was 16 : 88 % higher (p < 0 : 00023). This shows that for ? = : 05, there is no statistical difference between either of the two <b>path</b> <b>plans</b> for survey time, survey distance, or RMS of cross-track error. However, there is a statistical difference between the two <b>path</b> <b>plans</b> for Hausdorff Distance, percent coverage and percentage of locations inside the bounding area. Due to the spiral path plan's inability to maintain locations inside the bounding area, a raster scan is the best <b>path</b> <b>plan</b> to use when surveying a bounded convex polygon with the Challenge 1 since it results in the highest percentage of coverage with no statistical difference in survey time, survey distance, or RMS of cross-track error. This result is only guaranteed for the Challenge 1 and its associated controller, with potentially different outcomes if tested on other surfaces vehicles, especially those with underwater propellers, rudders, or jet pump (no propeller or rudder) propulsion systems...|$|R

2500|$|In 1968, AI {{researcher}} Nils Nilsson {{was trying}} to improve the <b>path</b> <b>planning</b> done by Shakey the Robot, a prototype robot that could navigate through a room containing obstacles. This path-finding algorithm, which Nilsson called A1, was a faster version of the then best known method, Dijkstra's algorithm, for finding shortest paths in graphs. [...] Bertram Raphael suggested some significant improvements upon this algorithm, calling the revised version A2. Then Peter E. Hart introduced an argument that established A2, with only minor changes, {{to be the best}} possible algorithm for finding shortest paths. Hart, Nilsson and Raphael then jointly developed a proof that the revised A2 algorithm was optimal for finding shortest paths under certain well-defined conditions.|$|E

They are able to operate in complex environments and perform non-repetitive and non-sequential tasks such as transporting photomasks in a semiconductor lab, specimens in hospitals and goods in warehouses.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques can be leveraged for better mission planning. This paper describes the coordinated use of both global navigation and metaheuristic optimization algorithms to plan the safe, efficient missions. The aim {{is to determine the}} least-cost combination of a safe landing zone (LZ) and global <b>path</b> <b>plan,</b> where avoiding terrain hazards for the lander and rover minimizes cost. Computer vision methods were used to identify surface craters, mounds, and rocks as obstacles.

Simulations were run for a sample Google Lunar X Prize mission. The result of this study is an optimization scheme that <b>path</b> <b>plans</b> with the A* search method, and uses simulated annealing to select ideal LZ-path- goal combination for the mission.

As a result, the car company Volvo proposed an idea for this project: to implement an Android based application to facilitate reverse navigation in their trucks. From a technical point of view, the most crucial obstacle that should be addressed is implementing a secure and reliable communication link between the smartphone and the truck's control centre.
