Banning <b>plastic</b> <b>microbeads</b> and single use plastics in general is crucial for a healthy environment.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, 5 Gyres {{was first}} to {{discover}} that <b>plastic</b> <b>microbeads</b> (commonly found in personal care products like toothpaste and exfoliating soaps) were polluting our waterways. 5 Gyres used that study to help forge a coalition that convinced companies like Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson and L’Oreal to phase our <b>plastic</b> <b>microbeads.</b> After only two years, the campaign scaled into a national movement, culminating in a watershed victory when President Obama signed the Microbead-Free Waters Act into law {{at the end of}} 2015.|$|R

50|$|Pointe-Claire mayor, Morris Trudeau {{and members}} of the City Council {{requested}} its residents to sign a petition asking governments of Canada and Quebec to ban “the use of <b>plastic</b> <b>microbeads</b> in cosmetic and cleansing products.” Trudeau suggested that if Quebec bans microbeads, manufactures will be encouraged to stop producing them in their products.|$|R
50|$|States such as California, New York, and Illinois {{recognized}} {{the damage that}} <b>plastic</b> <b>microbeads</b> were doing and began to enact statewide and local county bans on microbeads. Their leadership spoke to the United States Congress, as did the support from the many groups who brought to light {{the harmful effects of}} microbeads. This motivated bipartisan support to ban microbeads on a federal level.|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, Erie County, New York {{passed the}} first local ban {{in the state}} of New York. It bans the sale and {{distribution}} of all <b>plastic</b> <b>microbeads</b> (including biodegradable ones) including from personal care products. , its prohibition on sales is stronger than any other law in the country. [...] It was enacted on August 12, 2015 and should take effect in February, 2016. This appears to be the first ban to go into effect in the country. In November 2015 four other NY counties followed suit.|$|R
50|$|At {{the federal}} level, the Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015 prohibits the {{manufacture}} and introduction into interstate commerce of rinse-off cosmetics containing intentionally-added <b>plastic</b> <b>microbeads</b> by July 1, 2017. Representative Frank Pallone proposed {{the bill in}} 2014 (H.R. 4895, reintroduced in 2015 as H.R. 1321). On December 7, 2015, his proposal was narrowed by amendment to rinse-off cosmetics, and passed unanimously by the House. The American Chemistry Council and other industry groups supported the final bill, which the Senate passed on December 18, 2015, and the president signed on December 28, 2015.|$|R
5000|$|Water {{quality in}} Taranaki {{has been under}} pressure. Quality varies over {{the length of the}} river, as shown in the table -In the summer of 2016 the MCI level at the viaduct was the lowest ever, {{probably}} due to earthworks by Fonterra, causing the rating to drop to poor. [...] Tangahoe is listed 5th in Taranaki for modification, with 2.27 km of consented stream modification in its catchment. Fonterra's Whareroa dairy has a consent to draw 30,000,000 L of water a day from the Tangahoe's tributary, the Tawhiti Stream, where flows, temperature, etc are recorded at both Tawhiti Rd and Whareroa. 1,741,050 L is also consented for irrigation. The dairy removes silt from the water with <b>plastic</b> <b>microbeads.</b>|$|R
30|$|Strong policy {{actions to}} curb {{unnecessary}} plastic packaging on the demand {{side on the}} short term, such as the ban on free single-use plastic bags, or to substantially increase the collection rate of plastic waste, such as the deposit-refund schemes for plastic beverage bottles 28 which have a demonstrated high rate of success in many countries, 29 and the ban on <b>plastic</b> <b>microbeads</b> in cosmetics and personal care products, are strongly needed at regional, sub-regional or national levels {{as part of their}} strategies for waste management. Initiatives to promote measurement of the types and quantities of plastic used by companies or communities, such as the ‘Plastic Disclosure Project’, 30 could facilitate accountability and the implementation of measures to reduce avoidable plastic use by the private and public sectors. Designers and producers should avoid creating products that are inherently single use or inevitably destined for landfill [85].|$|R
40|$|Cosmetic products, such as facial scrubs, {{have been}} {{identified}} as potentially important primary sources of microplastics to the marine environment. This study characterises, quantifies and then investigates the sorptive properties of <b>plastic</b> <b>microbeads</b> that are used as exfoliants in cosmetics. Polyethylene microbeads were extracted from several products, and shown to have a wide size range (mean diameters between 164 to 327 μm). We estimated that between 4594 – 94500 microbeads could be released in a single use. To examine the potential for microbeads to accumulate and transport chemicals they were exposed to a binary mixture of 3 H-phenanthrene and 14 C-DDT in seawater. The potential for transport of sorbed chemicals by microbeads was broadly similar to that of polythene (PE) particles used in previous sorption studies. In conclusion, cosmetic exfoliants are a potentially important, yet preventable source of microplastic contamination in the marine environment...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{continuous}} manufacturing of cellulose microbeads as a sustainable alternative to plastic micro-particles, currently used {{in a wide range}} of consumer products, from toothpaste to paints. <b>Plastic</b> <b>microbeads</b> are not retained by, or degraded in, waste water treatment plants (due to their size and composition), accumulating in the environment in general and aquatic life in particular, eventually finding their way into the human food supply chain. Here it is demonstrated, for the first time, that a cross-flow membrane emulsification – phase inversion process can be used to generate stabilized micro-droplets of cellulose dissolved in an organic electrolyte solution (1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate:DMSO) in a sunflower oil-Span 80 continuous phase. The emulsion is subsequently coagulated with an anti-solvent, resulting in the formation of solid, spherical and biodegradable cellulose microbeads. A systematic analysis of process parameters (continuous and disperse phase flow rate, viscosity and applied pressure) allowed the determination of a regime within which microspheres can be predictably produced using a 10 µm pore size porous glass membrane. Cross-linking of the cellulose beads with glyoxal led to a 3 -fold increase in compressive strength of the beads, broadening the potential range of applications where these biodegradable particles could replace current environmentally persistent materials...|$|R
40|$|Microplastics {{enter the}} {{environment}} {{as a result of}} larger plastic items breaking down (‘secondary’) and from particles originally manufactured at that size (‘primary’). Personal care productsare an important contributor of secondary microplastics (typically referred to as ‘microbeads’), for example in toothpaste, facial scrubs and soaps. Consumers {{play an important role in}} influencing the demand for these products and therefore any associated environmental consequences. Hence we need to understand public perceptions in order to help reduce emissions of microplastics. This study explored awareness of <b>plastic</b> <b>microbeads</b> in personal care products in three groups: environmental activists, trainee beauticians and university students in South West England. Focus groups were run, where participants were shown the quantity of microbeads found in individual high-street personal care products. Qualitative analysis showed that while the environmentalists were originally aware of the issue, it lacked visibility and immediacy for the beauticians and students. Yet when shown the amount of plastic in a range of familiar everyday personal care products, all participants expressed considerable surprise and concern at the quantities and potential impact. Regardless of any perceived level of harm in the environment, the consensus was that their use was unnatural and unnecessary. This research could inform future communications with the public and industry as well as policy initiatives to phase out the use of microbeads...|$|R
50|$|Plastic {{particle}} {{water pollution}} is marine debris consisting of plastic particles, including nurdles, pre-production microplastic resin pellets typically under 5 mm in diameter found {{outside of the}} typical plastic manufacturing stream and an intermediate good used to produce <b>plastic</b> final products; <b>microbeads</b> from cosmetics; and the breakdown products of plastic litter.

40|$|Summary. DNA has the {{theoretical}} capability of storing vast databases {{in a very}} compact volume, for example, a gram of DNA can store 4. 2 x 10 21 bits of information. Subsequently, encoded data can be retrieved by associative search queries. However, until now no large scale experiments have verified this. We describe the experimental creation of very large databases of artificially synthesized DNA sequences designed for encoding digital data. A database, or library, consists of sequences of single-stranded DNA, each sequence encodes a number which provides the index to the database element. DNA subsequences, {{also referred to as}} words, were designed using computer search algorithms to ensure significant Hamming distance between distinct words to allow for annealing discrimination. The largest libraries are constructed in two phases: (1) An initial DNA library is constructed on <b>plastic</b> <b>microbeads</b> by combinatorial, mix-and-split methods. (2) Half the library is cleaved from the beads and concatenated onto the remaining bead-bound strands to generate a new library containing elements of twice the original length and library diversity which is the square of the original. We have completed the first stage in a number of experiments of increasing size, currently the largest of which has 12 7 microbeads, each carrying approximately 10 7 strands of DNA. This already constitutes by far the largest number of distinct DNA strands synthesized in a library of this type. Following successful completion of the second construction phase, the resulting DNA library will contain 12 14 or 1. 28 x 10 15 distinct data elements...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to the detrimental consequences that ingestion of plastics by marine biota may entail [8 – 10], worrying environmental consequences of marine litter also stem from microplastics (less than 5  mm in diameter) and nanoplastics (less than 100  nm {{in at least one}} of its dimensions), which could potentially affect marine biota both from their physical nature if ingested and by transfer of chemicals associated with them, including persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs). Most micro- and nanoplastics originate from the degradation of macroplastics through different pathways, i.e. photodegradation and other weathering processes of plastics that have leaked into the sea [1], e.g. bags, bottles, lids, food packaging, etc.; from plastic pellets lost into the environment during production or freight process; or from textile fibres coming from washing machine runoff 4 [3, 11]. They may also be present as deliberately manufactured <b>plastic</b> <b>microbeads</b> used as scrubbing agents or for other purposes that can be found in some personal care and cosmetic products. It has been estimated that in the USA alone, even considering that all sewage is connected to tertiary waste water treatment plants (WWTP), and assuming a 99 % efficiency of the sedimentation process, around 8 trillion microbeads may nevertheless be released into aquatic habitats every day. Furthermore, as the sludge of the WWTPs may subsequently be applied as fertilizer, part of the remaining 800 trillion microbeads may enter into soils and aquatic habitats via runoff [12]. 5 Some wildlife may also contribute to the overall burden of microplastics when they ingest larger pieces of plastic which are then broken up into smaller pieces in their guts and lost back into the environment in form of microplastics. For example, fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis), a type of seabird, alone are estimated to reshape and redistribute annually about 6  tonnes of microplastics [13].|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{increase}} in bans of microbeads in the USA, many cosmetic companies are also phasing out microbeads from their production lines. L’Oreal is planning to phase out polyethylene microbeads in the exfoliates, cleansers and shower gels from their products by 2017. Johnson and Johnson, who have already started to phase out microbeads at the end of 2015, will by 2017 not be producing any polyethylene microbeads in their products. Lastly, Crest phased out <b>microbead</b> <b>plastics</b> in its toothpastes by February of 2016. The global phase out should be completed by the end of 2017.|$|R
30|$|Sylvia Frey (Ocean Care, Wädenswil, Switzerland) gave an {{overview}} of the current knowledge on the occurrence and biological impacts of microplastics in freshwater and saltwater bodies. Microplastics can function as vectors of chemicals by accumulating persistent organic pollutants (e.g., PCBs) and transferring them to living organisms. There is an urgent need to better understand such interactions and to curb plastic inputs into the aquatic environment from: (1) single-use <b>plastics,</b> (2) <b>microbeads</b> in cosmetics, and (3) plastic fibers which are not completely removed in WWTPs. A major barrier to advancing research and implementing policy action on the issue of microplastics is the lack of standard analytical methods to quantify microplastics. With currently used non-standard methods, the risk of false positives can be considerable. Florian Storck (Water Technology Center, Karlsruhe, Germany) presented his research on analytics and occurrence of microplastics in inland waterways. He recommends not to rely on visual sample inspection only, but to include chemical analysis like Raman microscopy. Nicole Bandow (Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und Prüfung, Berlin, Germany) measured chemicals released from three different types of microplastics: polystyrene, high density polyethylene, and polyvinyl chloride. The plastic materials were either directly eluted, or first exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light or thermic stress and then eluted. Many different peaks were detected in eluates, even more after plastics were exposed to UV or heat. Their identification is challenging, and an ecotoxicological evaluation based on analytical results is difficult {{due to the lack of}} toxicological data. She concluded that effect-based assays are needed to assess the toxicity of the eluates. Concentrations of microplastics in Swiss lakes and rivers were measured by Florian Faure (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland). All water bodies investigated contained microplastics. Concentrations increased by 5 – 150 times after stormwater overflow events. Faure and colleagues also analyzed selected additives and monomers in the plastic particles, as well as hydrophobic micropollutants. All chemicals of interest were detected, including bisphenol A, nonylphenol, and several phthalates.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{developed}} a new granular material (MatIV) to study experimentally landscape evolution in active mountain belt piedmonts. Its composition and related physical properties have been determined using empirical criteria derived from the scaling of deformation, erosion-transport and sedimentation natural processes. MatIV is a water-saturated composite material made up with 4 granular components (silica powder, glass <b>microbeads,</b> <b>plastic</b> powder and graphite) whose physical, mechanical and erosion-related properties were measured with different laboratory tests. Mechanical measurements were made on a modified Hubbert-type direct shear apparatus. Erosion-related properties were determined using an experimental set-up that allows quantifying the erosion/sedimentation budget from tilted relaxation topographies. For MatIV, we also investigated the evolution of mean erosion rates and stream power erosion law exponents in 1 D {{as a function of}} slope.;Our results indicate that MatIV satisfies most of the defined criteria. It deforms brittlely according to the linear Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion and localizes deformation along discrete faults. Its erosion pattern is characterized by realistic hillslope and channelized processes (slope diffusion, mass wasting, channel incision). During transport, eroded particles are sorted depending on their density and shape, which results in stratified alluvial deposits displaying lateral fades variations. To evaluate the degree of similitude between model and nature, we used a new experimental device that combines accretionary wedge deformation mechanisms and surface runoff erosion processes. Results indicate that MatIV succeeded in producing detailed morphological and sedi-mentological features (drainage basin, channel network, terrace, syntectonic alluvial fan). Geometric, kinematic and dynamic similarity criteria have been investigated to compare precisely model to nature. Although scaling is incomplete, it yields particularly informative orders of magnitude. With all these characteristics, MatIV appears as a very promising material to investigate experimentally a wide range of scientific questions dealing with relief dynamics and interactions between tectonics, erosion and sedimentation processes...|$|R
