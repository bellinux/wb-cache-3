40|$|Visitors to the Boyce Thompson Arboretum {{are truly}} {{impressed}} by the numerous desert plants, trees and specialty gardens. A fantas-tic setting. "It is all so natural, " An "Arizona paradise " are com-ments frequently made by visitors. Whether a few hours or a day, the time enjoyed at the Arboretum is never long enough. Sit down at any one of numerous sites along the many pathways, relax and you will likely not want to leave. That is how {{the founder of the}} Arboretum, Colonel William Boyce Thompson, felt when he first visited the area. William Boyce Thompson was an extremely wealthy man. He had made his millions in mining and investments. Two mines from his worldwide portfolio, the Magma and the Inspiration, brought him to this part of Arizona. Following his first view of <b>Picket</b> <b>Post</b> Mountain and the adjoining wide expanse, Thompson knew he would build a home nearby. The house that he had constructed was located on a cliff near the foot of <b>Picket</b> <b>Post.</b> It came to be called <b>Picket</b> <b>Post</b> House. It was more than a modest home, it was an 8, 000 square foot mansion. From his Arizona residence, he viewed the beauty of his neighbor, <b>Picket</b> <b>Post</b> Mountain, the maj...|$|R

50|$|<b>Picket</b> <b>Post</b> {{was once}} an {{important}} junction of the toll road to Poole with the road to Burley and Lymington. The name derives from a <b>picket</b> (i.e. a <b>post)</b> which marked the spot, but it may have acquired a second meaning from a picket of soldiers stationed at a strategic point on the smugglers's route. There was an inn here {{for most of the}} 19th century, which around 1900 became a tea house whose sign was a large golden kettle - it was demolished in 1969.|$|R
5000|$|The {{site was}} {{abandoned}} in 1871 {{by the army}} one month after being named Camp Pinal. The troops started their mule trail at [...] "Infantry Camp" [...] {{at the foot of}} <b>Picket</b> <b>Post</b> and then extended it into <b>Picket</b> <b>Post</b> Creek (later called Queen Creek). The trail then crossed Devil's Canyon (named by the troops) and halted at a post they intended to build in what was then called [...] "Mason's Valley" [...] (later, Camp Pinal). By April 1871 the mule trail and post were both completed and General Stoneman planned on making Camp Pinal his headquarters, but the project was abandoned after General George Crook replaced General Stoneman because of the Camp Grant Massacre of April 1871. By August of that year General Crook abandoned the post, and only the mule trail was left to indicate the intended ambitious presence of U.S. soldiers.|$|R

Further developments occurred from Ringwood to <b>Picket</b> <b>Post</b> near the turn-off for Burley. From 1966-1972, the remaining sections were completed rapidly due {{to the construction of}} the M27 motorway up to Jct 1.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the ball}} a report came in that Union cavalry were nearby in Hyattstown and heading towards Urbana. The festivities stopped and Stuart and his men left to the <b>picket</b> <b>posts</b> in Hyattstown that were {{threatened}} by Union cavalry.

By the time they had returned most of the ladies had left. Ladies were invited to return to {{the ball a}}nd the ball resumed.|$|R
60|$|Early in {{the morning}} the action recommenced and, stubbornly contesting each foot, at times almost in hand-to-hand {{conflict}} with tribesmen in the bushes, the rear guard fell back. The summit of the Kotal was passed; but the enemy continued to harass their retirement down to the river, where the <b>picket</b> <b>post</b> of the 9th Ghoorkhas was reached. The retirement from the Tirah had cost a hundred and sixty-four killed and wounded. As a military achievement, this march of Lockhart's 2nd Division should have a prominent place {{in the history of the}} British army.|$|R
25|$|Pyron's {{force of}} 300 camped at Apache Canyon, {{at one end}} of Glorieta Pass, leaving a <b>picket</b> <b>post</b> of 50 men at the summit of the pass. Chivington led 418 {{soldiers}} to the pass and, on the morning of March 26, moved out to attack. After noon Chivington’s men captured the <b>picket</b> <b>post</b> and found the main force behind them. Chivington advanced on them, but their artillery fire threw him back. He regrouped, split his force to {{the two sides of the}} pass, caught the Confederates in a crossfire, and soon forced them to retire. Pyron retired about a mile and a half (about 2=1/2 kilometers) to a narrow section of the pass and formed a defensive line before Chivington’s men appeared. The Union forces flanked Pyron’s men again and punished them with enfilade fire. Pyron ordered another retreat, but the withdrawal of the artillery caused the Confederates to become disorganized and start fighting in separate clusters of men. Chivington ordered a mounted Colorado company to make a frontal charge against the artillery; this succeeded in capturing several Confederates and scattering the rest. Not knowing if Confederate reinforcements were nearby, Chivington then retired and went into camp at Kozlowski’s Ranch to await Slough with the main body. His small victory was a morale boost for Slough's army.|$|R

50|$|Martins Heron is {{well known}} locally as being the site of Harry Potter's uncle and aunt's house. The filmed version {{of the first of}} JK Rowling's famous stories, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was filmed partly on location. The {{external}} scenes with the actor Daniel Radcliffe playing Harry Potter at his house were shot on location at a house in <b>Picket</b> <b>Post</b> Close, Martins Heron. However, according to the documentary Creating the World of Harry Potter, logistics made this location impractical as a long-term filming location, so a portion of the street was recreated on the backlot of Leavesden Film Studios.|$|R
50|$|Just before noon, a {{shot was}} {{heard from the}} <b>picket</b> <b>post</b> north of camp at Stirling's, and then a number more shots were heard from the cane fields {{to the north and}} east of the house. Mouton had begun his attack. Leake ordered the {{artillery}} up the road and in position at the gap in the levee to fire across the cane fields. The 19th Iowa was ordered to a fence running east to west behind the house and commence firing. The 26th Indiana was then posted {{to the left of the}} 19th, facing west, and ordered to fire obliquely to the right.|$|R
50|$|He {{wrote that}} {{in the very early}} days of Tucson, an Indian {{fortification}} was constructed {{at the top of a}} small mountain that would come to be called Sentinel Peak---also sometimes referred to as <b>Picket</b> <b>Post</b> Butte. This Indian fortification in time became known as the sentinel station because a sentinel or guard was posted there to watch for approaching enemies, likely Apache Indians. During the U.S. Civil War, armed guards or soldiers were posted at the sentinel station and a canvas was stretched across the stone fortification, to keep the sun from hitting directly on the men posted there.|$|R
50|$|The {{arboretum}} {{was founded}} by William Boyce Thompson (1869 - 1930), a mine engineer who created his fortune in the mining industry. He was the founder and first president of Inspiration Consolidated Copper Company at Globe-Miami, Arizona and Magma Copper Company in Superior, Arizona. In the early 1920s, Thompson, enamored with the landscape around Superior, built a winter home overlooking Queen Creek. Also in the 1920s, as his fortunes grew, he created and financed the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research in Yonkers, New York (now at Cornell University in Ithaca), and the Boyce Thompson Arboretum on {{the property of the}} <b>Picket</b> <b>Post</b> House, west of Superior, Arizona.|$|R
50|$|They {{captured}} American <b>pickets</b> <b>posted</b> in {{the village}} of Youngstown, the men having been trying to stay warm instead of keeping watch. One of the prisoners was forced to reveal the American challenge and password. The British force then advanced silently towards the fort. An advance party of some artillerymen and the grenadier company of the 100th under a lieutenant and a sergeant approached the gate, where the sergeant affected an accent from the southern American states and confused the guard long enough to gain entry. By the time the defenders became aware of the deception, {{it was too late to}} stop the British from rushing in.|$|R

50|$|In 1862, {{during the}} New Mexico Campaign of the American Civil War a Confederate force {{approached}} the ford at Valverde, six {{miles north of}} Fort Craig, hoping to cut Union communications between the fort and their headquarters in Santa Fe. About midnight, Union Captain James Craydon tried {{to blow up a}} few rebel <b>picket</b> <b>posts</b> by sending mules loaded with barrels of fused gunpowder into the Confederate lines, but the faithful old army mules insisted on wandering back toward the Union camp before blowing to bits. Although the only casualties were two mules, the explosions stampeded a herd of Confederate beef cattle and horses into the Union's lines, so depriving the Confederate troops of some much-needed provisions and horses.|$|R
5000|$|The Bangalore {{continues}} to be used today in the little-changed M1A2 version, primarily to breach wire obstacles. British Royal Engineers, Canadian combat engineers and infantry assault pioneers, along with American combat engineers, have also been known to construct similar field versions of the Bangalore by assembling segments of metal <b>picket</b> <b>posts</b> and filling the concave portion with plastic explosive. The PE is then primed with detonating cord and a detonator, and pickets are taped or wired {{together to make a}} long torpedo, producing fragments (aka [...] "shrapnel") that cut the wire when detonated. This method produces results similar to the standard-issue Bangalore, and can be assembled to the desired length by adding picket segments.|$|R
50|$|The second {{incident}} {{was a minor}} skirmish on May 6 and 7, 1864 between invading Union and Confederate forces. Union forces were generally invading and securing the rail lines as they progressed towards Atlanta. Confederate <b>pickets</b> were <b>posted</b> to delay advancing troops.|$|R
5000|$|Swift re-entered {{military}} service when the War of 1812 broke out, {{as a member}} of the New York Volunteers, and was assigned the rank of brigadier general. In July 1814 (between the Battle of Chippawa and the Battle of Lundy's Lane), Swift's unit was on the Canadian side of the Niagara River as the American forces attempted to invade Upper Canada. On July 12, Swift led a charge to take Fort George, near modern-day Niagara-on-the-Lake. After capturing a <b>picket</b> <b>post,</b> Swift was assassinated by one of the defenders, whose weapons he had not confiscated. [...] He was initially buried there, but a group of Palmyrans repatriated his remains to the cemetery that today bears his name, the General John Swift Memorial Cemetery.|$|R

2500|$|By the 20th the Confederate army, {{under cover}} of the hills {{between it and the}} river, was {{opposite}} Fort Craig. [...] Green attempted to place artillery on the heights overlooking the river and fort, but Canby had anticipated the move forcing the Texans to make a 'dry camp' {{on the night of the}} 20th. About midnight, Union Captain James Craydon tried to blow up a few rebel <b>picket</b> <b>posts</b> by sending mules loaded with barrels of fused gunpowder into the Confederate lines, but the faithful old army mules insisted on wandering back toward the Union camp before blowing to bits.

50|$|While Hooker still {{maintained}} the initiative, he commanded a three-pronged eastward thrust. The 1st & 3rd Divisions of the V Corps (Meade) advanced along River Road, the 2nd Division (Sykes) advanced along the Turnpike, and {{the entirety of}} the XII Corps (Slocum) advanced along the Plank Road. One mile out, Slocum (XII Corps, including the 125th Pennsylvania) encountered a Confederate <b>picket</b> <b>post</b> and reacted cautiously by deploying his two divisions in line of battle, one Division on each side of Plank Road. Advancing slowly for the next half mile in this formation, the XII Corps had just emerged onto high ground at the Alrich farm, favorable for an offensive, when a Hooker emissary, Colonel Joseph Dicksinson, reported the advance far short of objective and already engaging the enemy at about 1:30 p.m.|$|R
60|$|A {{few days}} later Colonel Jones was ordered {{to take charge of}} the <b>pickets</b> <b>posted</b> on the Rapidan, but before {{reaching}} Orange a gentleman rode up at full speed and informed them that the enemy were in possession of that town. Colonel Jones divided his regiment into two parts, and with one charged the Federal cavalry in the main street of Orange, while the other portion of the regiment, under Major Marshall, attacked them on the flank. After a sharp fight the enemy were driven from the place; but they brought up large re-enforcements, and pouring in a heavy fire, attacked the town on both sides, and the Confederates had to fall back. But they made another stand a little way out of the town, and drove back the Federal cavalry who were pressing them.|$|R
60|$|In {{the evening}} {{information}} came in, from the {{villages in the}} plain, {{that large numbers of}} the Mongals--who inhabited the hills--were meditating an attack.
