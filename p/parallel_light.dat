5|$|Reflector sights work {{by using}} a lens or an image-forming curved mirror with a {{luminous}} or reflective overlay image or reticle at its focus, creating an optical collimator that produces a virtual image of that reticle. The image is reflected off some form of angled beam splitter or the partially silvered collimating curved mirror itself so that the observer (looking through the beam splitter or mirror) will see the image at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics superimposed in the sight's field of view in focus at ranges up to infinity. Since the optical collimator produces a reticle image made up of collimated light, light that is nearly parallel, the light making up that image is theoretically perfectly parallel with the axis of the device or gun barrel it is aligned with, i.e. with no parallax at infinity. The collimated reticle image can also be seen at any eye position in the cylindrical volume of collimated light created by the sight behind the optical window. But this also means, for targets closer than infinity, sighting towards the edge of the optical window can make the reticle move in relation to the target since the observer is sighting down a <b>parallel</b> <b>light</b> bundle at the edge. Eye movement perpendicular to the device's optical axis will make the reticle image move in exact relationship to eye position in the cylindrical column of light created by the collimating optics.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} mirror localization to calibrate a catadioptric imaging system. Even though the calibration of a catadioptric system includes the estimation of various parameters, {{in this paper we}} focus on the localization of the mirror. Since some previously proposed methods assume a single view point system, they have strong restrictions on the position and shape of the mirror. We propose a method that uses <b>parallel</b> <b>lights</b> to simplify the geometry of projection for estimating the position of the mirror, thereby not restricting the position or shape of the mirror. Further, we omit the translation process between the camera and calibration objects from the parameters to be estimated by observing some <b>parallel</b> <b>lights</b> from a different direction. We obtain the constraints on the projection and compute the error between the model of the mirror and the measurements. The position of the mirror is estimated by minimizing the error. We also test our method by simulation and real experiments, and finally we evaluate the accuracy of our method. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} mirror localization to calibrate a catadioptric imaging system. While the calibration of a catadioptric system includes the estimation of various parameters, {{we focus on the}} localization of the mirror. The proposed method estimates the position of the mirror by observing pairs of <b>parallel</b> <b>lights,</b> which are projected from various directions. Although some earlier methods for calibrating catadioptric systems assume that the system is single viewpoint, which is a strong restriction on the position and shape of the mirror, our method does not restrict the position and shape of the mirror. Since the constraint used by the proposed method is that the relative angle of two <b>parallel</b> <b>lights</b> is constant with respect to the rigid transformation of the imaging system, we can omit both the translation and rotation between the camera and calibration objects from the parameters to be estimated. Therefore, the estimation of the mirror position by the proposed method is independent of the extrinsic parameters of a camera. We compute the error between the model of the mirror and the measurements, and then estimate the position of the mirror by minimizing this error. We test our method using both simulation and real experiments, and evaluate the accuracy thereof. ...|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{possibility}} of refraction, the light's direction at emission is generally not the same as its direction at reception. In refractive media, the light's path generally deviates from the straight distance between the points of emission and reception. The Doppler effect depends on the component of the emitter's velocity <b>parallel</b> to the <b>light's</b> direction at emission, and the component of the receiver's velocity <b>parallel</b> to the <b>light's</b> direction at absorption.
