For Static SIMS each subsequent <b>primary</b> <b>ion</b> hits an undamaged area and total of only 0.1-1% of the atomic sites are bombarded during the measurement. To ensure this very low primary current densities are used generally in the range of 10−10 - 10−9 A/cm² (<b>primary</b> <b>ion</b> dose is below 1012 - 1013 ions/cm2). This leads to extremely small sputtering rates of fraction of a monolayer per hour and hence small secondary ion current density. Additionally, these emitted secondary ions are of low kinetic energy and emitted up to 20 nm from the impact site with surface annealing occurring in femto-seconds. These reasons make SSIMS a purely surface analysis technique causing negligible damage to the surface and with detection limit as low as 10−8 monolayer (ML).|$|E

Dependent on the conditions, the unprotonated series can dominate the spectra. Since in the gas phase (H 2 O) n + is unstable {{with respect to the}} formation of the protonated ion series, the presence of the solid must provide a means to stabilize their formation. The cluster ion yields under Au + bombardment are very low and can be understood in terms of sputtering on the borderline between linear cascade and thermal spike behavior. There is a 10 4 increase in yield across the whole spectrum compared to Au + when Au 3 + and C 60 + species are used as <b>primary</b> <b>ions.</b> The character of the spectra differed between these two <b>primary</b> <b>ions,</b> but insights into the mechanism of secondary ion emission for both is discussed within an energy deposition framework provided by the fluid flow-based mesoscale energy deposition footprint (MEDF) model that predicts a cone-shaped zone of activation and emission. C 60 + differs from Au 3 + in that it delivers its energy closer to the surface, and it is argued this has consequences for the cluster ion distribution and yield. Increasing the ion dose by sputtering suppresses the yield of (H 2 O) n + and increases the yield of the protonated ions in the small cluster region, whereas the yield in the large cluster regime is suppressed significantly. The three <b>primary</b> <b>ions</b> show rather different behavior, and this is discussed {{in the light of the}} sputtering models.
