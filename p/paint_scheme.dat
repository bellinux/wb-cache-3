5|$|Color schemes {{included}} light gray, haze gray, ocean gray, and black. Haze gray {{was found}} to provide reasonable protection in the widest range of conditions, and became a standard US Navy <b>paint</b> <b>scheme</b> after World War II. Ocean gray also became a standard <b>paint</b> <b>scheme</b> after the war. Although black is still used for submarines, it was discontinued on destroyers after it had been determined that black ships remained more noticeable than gray ships on even the darkest nights.|$|E
5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{is a form}} {{of military}} deception in which a ship is painted in one or more colors in order to obscure or confuse an enemy's visual observation. Several types of marine camouflage have been used or prototyped: blending or crypsis, in which a <b>paint</b> <b>scheme</b> attempts to hide a ship from view; deception, in which a ship is made to look smaller or, as with the Q-ships, to mimic merchantmen; and dazzle, a chaotic <b>paint</b> <b>scheme</b> which tries to confuse any estimate of distance, direction, or heading. Counterillumination, to hide a darkened ship against the slightly brighter night sky, was trialled by the Royal Canadian Navy in diffused lighting camouflage.|$|E
5|$|The {{boat was}} {{decommissioned}} {{at some point}} in the 1950s after a brief service life. In 1959, it was handed over to the Technical Museum in Zagreb, where it has been on display ever since. Beginning in 2008, Mališan underwent restoration of its interior and exterior which included returning its original Italian <b>paint</b> <b>scheme</b> and designation.|$|E

There are plans to electrify the Nordland Line from Trondheim to Steinkjer, {{as well as the}} Meråker Line. Once these lines are electrified, the Class 92 can be retired, although no date has yet been set. During May and June 2012 all NSB Class 92 trains based in Trondheim were fitted with free wireless Internet access for the passengers.|$|E
5|$|C-32 – The United States Air Force (USAF) {{operates}} four VIP-configured 757-200s {{under the}} designation C-32A for missions including transporting the Vice President of the United States under the callsign Air Force Two. The C-32As are {{outfitted with a}} communication center, conference room, seating area, and private living quarters. The USAF also operates two 45-seat 757-200 aircraft, designated C-32B, {{for use by the}} U.S. State Department Foreign Emergency Support Team. The C-32As feature the blue-and-white <b>paint</b> <b>scheme</b> used by the USAF for its VIP transport fleet, while the C-32Bs are painted in solid white with minimal identification markings. The first C-32s were delivered in 1998 and replaced C-137 Stratoliner transports.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sheer number}} of special <b>paint</b> <b>schemes</b> has led to {{criticism}} that {{they are no longer}} [...] "special" [...] at all.

5|$|Concorde had livery restrictions; the {{majority}} of the surface had to be covered with a highly reflective white paint to avoid overheating the aluminium structure due to heating effects from supersonic flight at Mach 2. The white finish reduced the skin temperature by 6 to 11 degrees Celsius. In 1996, Air France briefly painted F-BTSD in a predominantly blue livery, {{with the exception of the}} wings, in a promotional deal with Pepsi. In this <b>paint</b> <b>scheme,</b> Air France was advised to remain at Mach 2 for no more than 20 minutes at a time, but there was no restriction at speeds under Mach 1.7. F-BTSD was used because it was not scheduled for any long flights that required extended Mach 2 operations.|$|E
5|$|On February 6, 1977, Amtrak {{announced}} plans to spend $24.4 million to overhaul all 61 cars {{as part of a}} larger fleet renewal program. In early 1977, some cars were repainted in Amtrak's Phase I <b>paint</b> <b>scheme</b> with red, white and blue ends and a small Amtrak logo. On September 28, the Amtrak board approved a more limited overhaul program of 16 Metroliners, as well as the purchase of the first 8 AEM-7 electric locomotives. On November 7, Amtrak released a specification for overhauling the 57 unmodified cars. It awarded a $20 million overhaul contract to GE that month.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, the Great Notch station, which was falling into disrepair, {{received}} a new paint job, {{changed from the}} red-green colors for the Erie Lackawanna to a new all red Erie Railroad <b>paint</b> <b>scheme.</b> The abandoned tool shed made {{out of the old}} wooden boxcar was also removed. Due to the removal of the tool boxcar, the propane tanks that heated the station building were also made visible. After the ending of the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad in 1976, the Great Notch station lay abandoned. In June 1979, the State of New Jersey began to remove the tracks for the Caldwell Branch, which also lay abandoned at Great Notch. Currently, what was the track leading to the Caldwell Branch is a siding. On January 20, 1988, the newly rehabilitated station building was destroyed by fire. During the construction of the Montclair Connection in 2001, the adjacent Great Notch Yard received a major upgrade, becoming a new state-of-the-art yard with new trains storage facilities.|$|E

5|$|Harrison {{attempted}} {{to increase the}} power of Southern's locomotives. In 1923, engineers under his direction created {{the plans for the}} P-4 class of Pacific type locomotives, which became famous and a symbol of the Southern Railway. On a visit to England, Harrison had seen the <b>paint</b> <b>scheme</b> used by the London and North Eastern Railway, which used apple green-painted engines. Returning home in 1925, he ordered the newly delivered Pacifics painted a forest green, which he called Virginia, with gold lettering and silver trim. The roof of each engine was painted brick red. These engines pulled the newly refurbished passenger trains that Harrison had begun work on before the war. He also instituted new passenger lines. In 1921 the Suwannee River Special began to run between Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland down to Tampa and St. Petersburg in Florida. The Crescent Limited began service in 1925 between New Orleans and New York, with a scheduled time for the one-way trip of 37hours and 50minutes.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{ships were}} {{generally}} not camouflaged. In special tactical situations, camouflage could be improvised, {{as when the}} battleships Yamato and Musashi had their decks blackened {{with a mixture of}} soot to help them hide while passing through the San Bernardino Strait at night in the October 1944 Battle of Leyte Gulf. Japanese ships largely retained their pre-war dark gray <b>paint</b> <b>scheme,</b> although some major units like aircraft carriers changed to a dark sea green. Some aircraft carriers had their flight decks painted in a dazzle camouflage, but this seems to have been ineffective. By 1945, with the remnants of the Japanese Navy seeking to hide from American air power, its battleships were painted in a variety of camouflage measures. Haruna for example wore olive green overall, its turrets painted light green with gray stripes, whereas Ises olive dress was broken up with patches of gray, red-brown, yellow, and dark green.|$|E
5|$|Ripken has {{received}} several tributes outside of baseball. On September 23, 2001, the NASCAR Winston Cup series and MBNA renamed the fall race at Dover International Speedway in Dover, Delaware, naming the race the MBNA Cal Ripken Jr. 400. The race {{paid tribute to}} the legacy of Ripken, who was in attendance greeting the competing drivers as they crossed the stage during driver introductions. Driver Bobby Labonte had a special <b>paint</b> <b>scheme</b> on his #18 Interstate Batteries car featuring Baltimore Orioles colors along with Ripken's retirement seal. The race was won by Dale Earnhardt Jr., who was then driving the #8 car. The race {{was also the first}} race held after the September 11, 2001, attacks as the race scheduled for Loudon a week earlier had been postponed {{in the wake of the}} attacks. On March 30, 2008, I-395's eastern branch in Baltimore, from I-95 to Conway Street, was named Cal Ripken Way.|$|E

5|$|The current {{color scheme}} was {{selected}} in 1974 by then athletic director and former head coach Bobby Dodd. The original Wreck decor featured a wooden GT shield {{on both the}} driver and passenger-side doors. This shield was removed during Dodd's revitalization of the old Model A. Dodd chose an old gold paint from a Lincoln car paint catalogue as the base for the new color scheme. He also placed a slightly stretched GT emblem on the door, a Tech helmet on the rear quarter panel, and a 1952 version of the Yellow Jacket on the front quarter panel. According to Tech lore, Bobby Dodd was so enamored with the Lincoln gold that he changed the football helmet and uniform color to match the new Ramblin' Wreck <b>paint</b> <b>scheme.</b>|$|E
5|$|Warner Bros. {{partnered with}} Mountain Dew to do a cross-promotion that {{included}} a special <b>paint</b> <b>scheme</b> on the number 88 Chevrolet Impala owned by Hendrick Motorsports and driven by Dale Earnhardt, Jr. in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. On June 17, 2012, the car won the 2012 Quicken Loans 400 at Michigan International Speedway. On July 4, 2012, the studio signed a deal with Formula One team Lotus F1 to have the film's logos appear on the Lotus E20s driven by Kimi Räikkönen and Romain Grosjean at the 2012 British Grand Prix. Räikkönen and Grosjean went on to finish the race in fifth and sixth place respectively. Warner Bros. had previously followed a similar promotion at the 2008 British Grand Prix, when the now-defunct Toyota F1 carried a livery to promote The Dark Knight.|$|E
5|$|Wisconsin steamed out of Hampton Roads on 6 March for Portsmouth, New Hampshire, {{arriving}} on the 9th. There, {{she entered the}} drydock for repairs and modifications, including a new gray <b>paint</b> <b>scheme.</b> After returning to service in June, she {{was assigned to the}} Atlantic Fleet, and she joined her unit in Hampton Roads {{at the end of the}} month. She immediate steamed back north for Portland, Maine, where she participated in Independence Day celebrations on 4 July. Wisconsin rejoined the fleet in Hampton Roads on 6 August for gunnery training off the Virginia Capes. Routine maintenance was performed at Hampton Roads during this period. In late September, she steamed to New York for the Hudson-Fulton Celebration. The celebration saw an international fleet of warships from Germany, Britain, France, Italy, and other countries join the Atlantic Fleet to commemorate Henry Hudson's discovery of the Hudson River. Wisconsin left the ceremonies on 5 October for repairs at Portsmouth, which lasted from 7 October to 28 November. She then returned to Hampton Roads, by way of Newport, Rhode Island, where she embarked sailors assigned to the Atlantic Fleet.|$|E

5|$|By 1965, the six {{passenger}} cars of the DRR's Retlaw 1 train, {{due to their}} slow passenger loading and unloading times, began to be phased out of service. In July 1974, the Retlaw 1 {{passenger cars}} were retired and stored in the DRR's roundhouse, except for the Grand Canyon observation coach, which was converted into a parlor car and renamed Lilly Belle after Walt Disney's wife Lillian. The Lilly Belle was given a new exterior <b>paint</b> <b>scheme</b> and a new interior, which included varnished mahogany paneling, velour curtains and seats, a floral-patterned wool rug, and Disney family pictures framed and hung on the walls. The first official passenger to come aboard the Lilly Belle after its conversion into a parlor car in September 1975 was Japanese Emperor Hirohito, and since then it can be regularly seen coupled {{on the ends of}} the DRR's trains. In 1996, rail collector Bill Norred acquired the five other Retlaw 1 passenger cars. Norred died two years later, and in 1999 his family sold the four coaches of the former Retlaw 1 passenger train to Rob Rossi, owner of the Pacific Coast Railroad located within Santa Margarita Ranch in Santa Margarita, California, leaving only the Retlaw 1 combine car in the Norred family's possession. On July 10, 2010, the Norred family sold the Retlaw 1 combine car to the Carolwood Foundation, which restored it and put it on display next to Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn within the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum complex in Los Angeles' Griffith Park.|$|E
