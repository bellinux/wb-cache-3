25|$|By 1940, Cadillac sales {{had risen}} tenfold {{compared}} to 1934. In 1936, Dreystadt released the Series 60 as Cadillac's {{entry into the}} mid-priced vehicle market. It {{was replaced by the}} Series 61 in 1939, but a popular model that was derived from it, the Sixty Special, continued through 1993. Another factor helped boost Cadillac growth over the next few years: a revolution in assembly line technology. In 1934, Henry F. Phillips introduced the <b>Phillips</b> <b>screw</b> and screwdriver to the market. He entered into talks with General Motors and convinced the Cadillac group that his new screws would speed assembly times and therefore increase profits. Cadillac was the first automaker to use the Phillips technology in 1937, which was widely adopted in 1940. For {{the first time in many}} years all cars built by the company shared the same basic engine and drivetrain in 1941.|$|E

5000|$|Pentalobe screws {{were first}} {{used in the}} iPhone 4. At first, #00 <b>Phillips</b> <b>screws</b> were used; however, many iPhone 4 models now have pentalobe screws. The screws used are {{slightly}} smaller than a Torx TS1, about 0.8 mm. If brought in to an Apple Store for repair, iPhone 4 models with #00 <b>Phillips</b> <b>screws,</b> if any, are replaced with 0.8 mm pentalobe screws. Third-party manufacturers rushed to produce screwdrivers that would remove 0.8 mm pentalobe screws after the iPhone 4's release in June 2010. These inexpensive, easily purchased drivers will remove pentalobe screws quite easily. Many are sold as [...] "kits" [...] containing a 5-point driver and <b>Phillips</b> #00 <b>screws,</b> in order to replace pentalobe screws with easily removable <b>Phillips</b> <b>screws.</b> Most other security screwdrivers will strip the miniature heads, effectively locking the user out of their device.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, in Portland, Oregon, Henry F. Phillips {{patented}} his own invention, {{an improved}} {{version of a}} deep socket with a cruciform slot, today known as the <b>Phillips</b> <b>Screw.</b> Phillips offered his screw to the American Screw Company, and after a successful trial on the 1936 Cadillac, it quickly swept through the American auto industry. With the Industrial Revival {{at the end of}} the Great Depression and the onslaught of World War II, the <b>Phillips</b> <b>screw</b> quickly became, and remains, the most popular screw in the world. A main attraction for the screw was that conventional slotted screwdrivers could also be used on them, which was not possible with the Robertson Screw.|$|E
50|$|The {{importance}} of the crosshead screw design lies in its self-centering property, useful on automated production lines that use powered screwdrivers. Phillips' major contribution was in driving the crosshead concept forward {{to the point where}} it was adopted by screwmakers and automobile companies. The credited inventor of the <b>Phillips</b> <b>screw</b> was John P. Thompson.|$|E
50|$|After {{failing to}} {{interest}} manufacturers, Thompson sold his self-centering design to Phillips in 1935. Phillips formed the <b>Phillips</b> <b>Screw</b> Company in 1934. After refining the design himself (U.S. Patent #2,046,343, U.S. Patents #2,046,837 to 2,046,840) for the American Screw Company of Providence, Rhode Island, Phillips succeeded {{in bringing the}} design to industrial manufacturing and promoting its rapid adoption as a machine screw standard. One of the first customers was General Motors who used the innovative design in 1936 for its Cadillac assembly-lines. By 1940, 85% of U.S. screw manufacturers had a license for the design. Due to failing health, Phillips retired in 1945. He died in 1958.|$|E
5000|$|Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) {{cross-head}} screwdrivers {{are still}} another standard, often inaccurately {{referred to as}} Japanese <b>Phillips.</b> Compatible <b>screw</b> heads are usually identifiable by a single depressed dot or an [...] "X" [...] {{to one side of}} the cross slot. This is a screw standard throughout the Asia market and Japanese imports. The driver has a 57° point with a flat tip.|$|R
50|$|Manual impact drivers {{consist of}} a heavy outer sleeve that {{surrounds}} an inner core that is splined to it. The spline is curved {{so that when the}} user strikes the outer sleeve with a hammer, its downward force works on the spline to produce turning force on the core and any socket or work bit attached to it. The tool translates the heavy rotational inertia of the sleeve to the lighter core to generate large amounts of torque. At the same time, the striking blow from the hammer forces the impact driver down into the screw reducing or eliminating cam out. This attribute is beneficial for <b>Phillips</b> <b>screws</b> which are prone to cam out. It is also excellent for use with the Robertson square socket head screws that are in common use in Canada. It is less beneficial for slot head screws and is not beneficial at all for most other types.|$|R
5000|$|NuBus {{was later}} {{selected}} by Apple Computer {{for use in}} their Macintosh II project, where its plug-n-play nature fit well with the Mac philosophy of ease-of-use. It was used {{in most of the}} Macintosh II series and Macintosh Quadras that made up the professional-level Mac lineup from the late 1980s into the mid-1990s, and was upgraded to NuBus90 starting with the Macintosh Quadras. Early Quadras only supported the 20 MHz rate when two cards were talking to each other, since the motherboard controller was not upgraded. This was later addressed in the NuBus implementation on the 660AV and 840AV models. This improved NuBus controller was used in the first generation Power Macintosh 6100, 7100 and 8100 models. Later Power Mac models adopted Intel's PCI bus. Apple's NuBus implementation used pin and socket connectors {{on the back of the}} card rather than edge connectors with <b>Phillips</b> <b>screws</b> inside the case that most cards use, making it much easier to install cards. Apple's computers also supplied an always-on +5 V [...] "trickle" [...] power supply for tasks such as watching the phone line while the computer was turned off. This was apparently part of an unapproved NuBus standard.|$|R

5000|$|Robertson, {{also known}} as a square, or Scrulox [...] screw drive has a {{square-shaped}} socket in the screw head and a square protrusion on the tool. Both the tool and the socket have a taper, which makes inserting the tool easier, and also tends to help keep the screw on the tool tip without the user needing to hold it there. (The taper's earliest reason for being was to make the manufacture of the screws practical using cold forming of the heads, but its other advantages helped popularize the drive.) Robertson screws are commonplace in Canada, though they have been used elsewhere [...] and have become much more common in other countries in recent decades. Robertson screwdrivers are easy to use one-handed, because the tapered socket tends to retain the screw, even if it is shaken. They also allow for the use of angled screw drivers and trim head screws. The socket-headed Robertson screws are self-centering, reduce cam out, stop a power tool when set, and can be removed if painted-over or old and rusty. In industry, they speed up production and reduce product damage. One of their first major industrial uses was the Ford Motor Company's Model A & Model T production. Henry Ford found them highly reliable and saved considerable production time, but when he couldn't secure licensing for them in the United States, limited their production use to his Canadian division. Robertson-head screwdrivers are available in a standard range of tip-sizes, from 1.77mm to 4.85mm. Reed and Prince, also called Frearson, is another historic cross-head screw configuration. The cross in the screw head is sharper and less rounded than a Phillips, and the bit has 45° flukes and a sharper, pointed end. Also, the <b>Phillips</b> <b>screw</b> slot is not as deep as the Reed and Prince slot. In theory, different size R&P screws fit any R&P bit size.|$|E
50|$|The VHS {{cassette}} is a 187 mm wide, 103 mm deep, 25 mm thick (7 × 4 × 1 inch) plastic shell {{held together}} with five <b>Phillips</b> head <b>screws.</b> The flip-up cover that protects the tape has a built-in latch with a push-in toggle {{on the right side}} (bottom view image). The VHS cassette also includes an anti-despooling mechanism consisting of several plastic parts between the plastic spools, near the front of the tape (white and black in the top view). The spool latches are released by a push-in lever within a 6.35 mm (¼ inch) hole accessed {{from the bottom of the}} cassette, 19 mm (¾ inch) inwards from the edge label.|$|R
40|$|Follow {{the steps}} below {{to install the}} Conifer Chamber, and read the {{operational}} considerations for information on configuring the LI- 6400 software to compute leaf temperature using energy balance. Figure 2. Unscrew the knurled adjustment nut. Installation The sensor head handle must be removed to accomodate the 6400 - 05, so a tripod is usually required for making measurements. 1. Remove the male end of the leaf temperature thermocouple connec-tor by pulling straight out, and pull the air hose from {{the underside of the}} leaf chamber. 2. Unplug the log switch (not used with the conifer chamber). If the log switch wires are threaded underneath the bottom cover of the sensor head, this cover must be removed to free the log switch con-nector. a. Turn the sensor head over and remove the 3 <b>Phillips</b> head <b>screws</b> as shown in Figure 1. b. Remove the hose barbs, if necessary. You may be able to slide the cover out from underneath the hose barbs; be careful not to damage the PC board under the cover. If you remove the hose barbs, be sure and note the position of the sample and reference air hoses; the sample hose is wrapped with a piece of black shrink wrap. c. Free the wires. d. Re-assemble the cover {{on the bottom of the}} sensor head. 3. Remove the handle assembly: a. Unscrew the knurled leaf chamber adjustment nut (turn clock-wise) until it is free of the handle (Figure 2). b. With the handle latching mechanism in the closed position, wrap tape or string around the handle (where your hand would nor-mally be) so that it will stay together. Failure to do so may result in the spring coming out. Leave the handle secured in this manner. c. Remove the 2 screws (3 on some instruments) on the back side of the handle, as shown in Figure 3, using a # 1 Phillips head screwdriver. Figure 1. Remove the 3 screws on the sensor head bottom cover...|$|R
