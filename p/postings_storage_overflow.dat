The present paper is intended to review the state of affairs of analytic methods, queueing analysis techniques in particular, which are essential to modeling of computer communication systems.

40|$|Recent {{proposals}} for multithreaded architectures employ speculative execution to allow threads with unknown dependences to execute speculatively in parallel. The architectures use hardware speculative storage to buffer speculative data, track data dependences and correct incorrect executions through roll-backs. Because all memory references access the speculative storage, current proposals implement speculative storage using small memory structures to achieve fast access. The limited {{capacity of the}} speculative storage causes considerable performance loss due to speculative <b>storage</b> <b>overflow</b> whenever a thread 2 ̆ 7 s speculative state exceeds the speculative storage capacity. Larger threads exacerbate the overflow problem but are preferable to smaller threads, as larger threads uncover more parallelism. In this article, we discover a new program property called memory reference idempotency. Idempotent references are guaranteed to be eventually corrected, though the references may be temporarily incorrect {{in the process of}} speculation. Therefore, idempotent references, even from nonparallelizable program sections, need not be tracked in the speculative storage, and instead can directly access nonspeculative storage (i. e., conventional memory hierarchy). Thus, we reduce the demand for speculative storage space in large threads. We define a formal framework for reference idempotency and present a novel compiler-assisted speculative execution model. We prove the necessary and sufficient conditions for reference idempotency using our model. We present a compiler algorithm to label idempotent memory references for the hardware.

30|$|When {{two or more}} {{vehicles}} encounter, each of {{them may}} contain several large data chunks. A data chunk has a different possibility of being delivered to the destination in different vehicles which depends on the contact quality between the data carrying vehicle and the destination vehicle. We cannot simply allocate the data chunk to the vehicle where it has the best possibility since there are storage bound. Therefore, we consider a joint allocation of data chunks in the buffer of both vehicles to maximize the entire delivery possibility of all data without <b>storage</b> <b>overflow.</b> Therefore, it is like there are two knapsacks {{and we try to}} put items in them to achieve maximal value under the constraint of storage. Besides that, the duration of each encountering is limited so that not all desired data chunks can be exchanged but also we need consider the communication constraint. In this paper, we model data chunk assignment problem as a multiple knapsack problem [26] where we try to achieve the maximal delivery possibility of all data chunks. When two vehicles meet, {{the first step is to}} exchange necessary information. Then, the second step is that all the data chunks are re-arranged according to their delivery possibility in different vehicles as a multiple knapsack problem. When the re-arrangement is applied, the spare space may not be enough for the movement of these data chunks. Another limitation is the capacity of the channel, due to the bandwidth and the contact duration, there exists a bound of maximal amount of data that could be transmitted, which also applies in the dense case. In the multi-copy scenario, since the data copy with lower priority can be dropped, therefore, the storage allowance is not only the free space in the buffer but also data chunks to be dropped.|$|R

The faster numerical algorithm established in this study is abbreviated with RCFCTNADSP (Compared Resultant-TNADSP). The methodology adopted in this work was comparative analysis development design. The major technologies used in this work are the FCTNADSP and FBNADSP which were hitherto simulated on the c++ programming technologies. The c++ served as a signal processing language simulator (SPLS). The execution times of the fast Cooley-Tukey and the fast Bluestein algorithms were 1. 70 seconds and 1. 74 seconds respectively. On comparing the speeds of the fast Cooley–Tukey and the fast Bluestein algorithms we observed that the fast Cooley-Tukey algorithm has 0. 04 seconds speed improvement over the fast Bluestein algorithm. In line with this outcome, we concluded that the fast Cooley-Tukey algorithm (FC-TNADSP) is faster than the fast Bluestein algorithm (FBNADSP). In the same vein the fast Cooley-Tukey algorithm (FC-TNADSP algodsp- 2) is therefore the fastest DSP algorithm. This is however faster than the spectrum of FFT algorithms of O(nlogn) computing speed, a speed considered to be the fastest hitherto. The result of this study shows we can have faster numerical algorithms other than the traditional spectrum of FFT algorithms of O(nlogn) computing speed.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objectives}} {{of this article}} were: to test the hydrometric accuracy of some water level variation measuring and recording devices using a metal measuring tank with weir, and to automatically determine runoff intensities and elements. These field tests were performed {{in order to ensure}} high accuracy and low uncertainty of studies at hydrological micro-scale (plot scale). Hydrometric tests targeted two level measurement conditions: (i) rise and <b>storage</b> - without <b>overflowing,</b> volumetric measurement V= f (H); and (ii) rise and overflowing, weir measurement Q = f (H). Hydrometric accuracy was evaluated by comparing the measured and recorded level using three instruments with a tell-tale level. This field experiment was conducted in Voineşti Experimental Basin, belonging to the National Institute of Hydrology and Water Management. Levels series data were processed with the software application ParExp v 1, in order to automatically convert them into discharges (Q). Hydrometric and hydrological test results highlighted certain aspects. The accuracy estimated for water fluctuation measurement and recording instruments in a weir water tank, for both level measurement conditions revealed accuracy errors (insufficient accuracy) when the runoff hydraulics was changed (<b>storage</b> Qacum ÷ <b>overflowing</b> Qdev). To remedy such instrumental deficiencies, a metrological control shall be performed under specific operational conditions (e. g., water tank) in order to meet increasing needs for high quality hydrological data. The hydrological data processing using the ParExp v 1 software application, at the junction of specific “rise and storage” and “rise and overflowing” flows indicated a temporal error (delay). The user may remedy this error by eliminating data from the Qacum-Qdev junction range until reaching the maximum/stabilized level.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this {{research}} is to develop a solid-state high definition television (HDTV) imager chip operating at a frame rate of about 170 frames/sec at 2 Megapixels per frame. This imager offers an order of magnitude improvement in speed over CCD designs and will allow for monolithic imagers operating from the IR to the UV. The technical approach of the project focuses {{on the development of the}} three basic components of the imager and their integration. The imager chip can be divided into three distinct components: (1) image capture via an array of avalanche photodiodes (APD's), (2) charge collection, <b>storage</b> and <b>overflow</b> control via a charge transfer transistor device (CTD), and (3) charge readout via an array of acoustic charge transport (ACT) channels.

Currently work is progressing towards the development of manufacturable designs for each of these component devices.

40|$|Hardware {{transactional}} {{memory has}} great potential {{to simplify the}} creation of correct and efficient multithreaded programs, allowing programmers to exploit more effectively the soon-to-be-ubiquitous multi-core designs. Several recent proposals have extended the original bounded transactional memory to unbounded transactional memory, a crucial step toward transactions becoming a generalpurpose primitive. Unfortunately, supporting the concurrent execution of an unbounded number of unbounded transactions is challenging, and as a result, many proposed implementations are complex. This paper explores a different approach. First, we introduce the permissions-only cache to extend the bound at which transactions overflow to allow the fast, bounded case {{to be used as}} frequently as possible. Second, we propose ONETM to simplify the implementation of unbounded transactional memory by bounding the concurrency of transactions that overflow the cache. These mechanisms work synergistically to provide a simple and fast unbounded transactional memory system. The permissions-only cache efficiently maintains the coherence permissions—but not data—for blocks read or written transactionally that have been evicted from the processor’s caches. By holding coherence permissions for these blocks, the regular cache coherence protocol can be used to detect transactional conflicts using only a few bits of on-chip <b>storage</b> per <b>overflowed</b> cache block. ONETM allows only one overflowed transaction at a time, relying on the permissions-only cache to ensure that overflow is infrequent. We present two implementations. In ONETM-Serialized, an overflowed transaction simply stalls all other threads in the application. In ONETM-Concurrent, non-overflowed transactions and non-transactional code can execute concurrently with the overflowed transaction, providing more concurrency while retaining ONETM’s core simplifying assumption...|$|R

This paper presents a swarm optimization based solution to a detailed operational model for short-term reservoir operation for irrigation of multiple crops. The model integrates the dynamics associated with the water released from a reservoir to the actual water utilized by crops at farm level. It takes into account the nonlinear relationship of root growth, soil heterogeneity, soil moisture dynamics for multiple crops, yield response to water deficit at various growth stages of the crops and economic benefits from the crops. As the developed model is a nonlinear one, it is solved using a novel global optimization technique, namely elitist-mutation particle swarm optimization (EMPSO). The model's applicability is demonstrated through a case study of Malaprabha Reservoir system in Southern India. The performance of the model is examined for different water deficit conditions and the sensitivity of the crop yield is analysed for water shortage at various growth stages. Also, the consideration of economic benefits in the objective function and its effect on the water allocation decisions for multiple crops are studied. Consequently, the output from the model includes initial <b>storages,</b> releases, <b>overflows</b> and evaporation losses for each 10 -day period on the reservoir side; and allocation of water, actual evapotranspiration and initial soil moisture for each crop for each 10 -day period on the field side, thus facilitating decision making for optimal utilization of the available water resources...|$|R

With the help of these relationships optimal dimensions of an improved high-side weir overflow chamber could be found. The steady state efficiency for this improved overflow chamber seems to be comparable to mat of a hydrodynamic separator, when both devices are subjected to the same surface load. On the other hand, during real storm events, the <b>storage</b> inside the <b>overflow</b> structure can play an important role. This role is investigated by calculating the removal efficiencies for both structures when 4 monitored storm events are used as input. When higher removal efficiencies are wanted, the storage effect gets more and more important and as a consequence the hydrodynamic separator can technically as well as economically compete with simpler structures like e. g, a high-side weir overflow. These findings are confirmed by a simple construction cost estimation. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the IAWQ. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

If the storage in the rain water tanks can be used to flatten the rain water runoff, rain water tanks can have an additional benefit. The effect of rain water tanks on the combined sewer overflow (CSO) emissions is therefore investigated with a reservoir model. Compared with storage in the combined sewer system or at the <b>overflow,</b> <b>storage</b> in rain water tanks will be more efficient in reducing the overflow emissions. However much more storage in rain water tanks must be provided to obtain the same overflow frequency as when downstream storage is used, because the storage in rain water tanks is less frequently available.

In order to visualize effectiveness of proposed stormwater harvesting, a numerical modelling and investigation was carried out using a daily water balance model. From historical data for the area, three calendar years were chosen as a dry year (1 st decile), average year (5 th decile) and wet year (9 th decile). Mathematical model considered actual rainfall and contributing catchment area. Evaporation from water surface, evapo-transpiration and infiltration are considered as losses. Calculated runoff was routed through an existing pond/storage. Once pond became full, subsequent runoffs from the upstream catchments were lost from water <b>storages</b> through <b>overflow.</b> Water demand was calculated throughout the year, considering water requirements for existing grass types as well as number of rainy days. Through model simulation, cumulative water demands, available water volumes and water supply deficits were calculated for three different climatic conditions (ie. dry, average and wet) under different storage volumes and contributing catchment areas. It was found {{that none of the}} modeled scenarios were able to achieve a secure supply for golf course watering. If water is taken only from harvested storage, even in wet year there will be water supply deficit. However, if the pond storage volume is increased, stored stormwater would be able to meet some portion of irrigation water demand in average years and wet years. However, there would be virtually no demand met in a dry year. If storage volume is increased continually, at one stage increased storage volume will not provide any extra benefit due to lack of inflow from catchment. If catchment area is increased, although available water for irrigation will be increased, however water supply deficit will also increase due to increased area of golf course, which has to be irrigated also. With increased catchment area, in wet year available water is decreasing.

Commercially, primary B +-tree like structures have been supported in DBMSs like Compaq Non-Stop SQL, Sybase Adaptive Server, and Microsoft SQL Server. Oracle’s index-organized table is like a primary B +-tree; however, it differs from its commercial counterparts in the following respects: 1) The storage organization {{does not require the}} entire row to be stored in the primary key index. Infrequently accessed columns can be selectively pushed into an <b>overflow</b> <b>storage</b> area to speed up access to columns that are frequently accessed. 2) Secondary indexes on index-organized tables support logical primary key-based row identifiers, and still provide performance comparable to secondary indexes with physical row identifiers by storing and making use of guess-DBA (Database Block Address). 3) Support for primary key compression leads to reduced storage requirements.
