5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song <b>puts</b> <b>me</b> {{in the mind of}} a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is so hard to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E
500|$|With {{the success}} of albums by Hill, Badu, and Maxwell, D'Angelo's second album Voodoo served as a further {{alternative}} to excesses of late 1990s R and hip hop, as neo soul reached its apex in 2000. A production of the Soulquarians, it was an exemplary creative milestone of neo soul. Ben Ratliff of The New York Times called the album [...] "the succes d'estime that proves the force of this new music: it is a largely unslick, stubbornly idiosyncratic and genuinely great album that has already produced two hit singles". By {{the time of her}} second album Mama's Gun (2000), Erykah Badu had been dubbed by writers as [...] "the queen of neo-soul". She said of the honorific title, [...] "I hated that because what if I don’t do that anymore? What if I change? Then that <b>puts</b> <b>me</b> in a penitentiary." [...] Subsequently, other artists attained success in the early 2000s, including Bilal, Musiq Soulchild, India.Arie, and Alicia Keys, who broke through to broader popularity with her debut album Songs in A Minor (2001). Hip hop artists such as The Roots and Common, associated with the Soulquarians, released albums that incorporated neo soul, Phrenology (2002) and Electric Circus (2003).|$|E

"Till the World Ends" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Dr. Luke and Max Martin, with additional writing by American recording artist Kesha and Alexander Kronlund, and additional production by Billboard. In {{an interview for}} Spin on February 11, 2011, Kesha announced she had co-written the song with Luke and Martin for Femme Fatale. She explained it was inspired by [...] "me imagining [...] and any female musician touring the world. When you go out, and you're having an amazing, magical night and you don't {{want to go to}} sleep and you want it to last until the world ends." [...] On March 2, 2011, the single's cover art, in which Spears appears sitting on a couch in a sweater and heels, was posted at Deezer.com. This was followed by a 30-second snippet of the song, which appeared at Amazon.de. [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] leaked online on March 3, 2011, which prompted Spears to post hours later on her Twitter account, [...] "Looks like the cat's out of the bag..."

[...] "Till the World Ends" [...] was made available on iTunes the same day, several days earlier than originally planned. Following the announcement, Kesha spoke to MTV News stating that [...] "I consider myself a songwriter before and above everything else, so it's an honor to write for one of pop music's biggest icons." [...] During an interview with Seacrest, Spears described [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] as [...] "fun. I like it. It's good energy. [...] I'm a vibe person, and I think I love good-mood songs, and if it <b>puts</b> <b>me</b> in a good mood, it clicks for me." ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 19, 2012, in an interview, West Coast rapper Kendrick Lamar {{revealed}} that he recorded a song with T.I. for the album. The song reportedly also features B.o.B and samples Gotye's hit single [...] "Somebody That I Used to Know". The song's mass appeal attracted T.I. to the sample: [...] "The record's just jamming. When I heard the twist they put on it, man, {{it was kind of}} a no-brainer." [...] T.I. also chose the record for its crossover ability, which he has always been successful with in the past: [...] "It sounds like hip-hop with an international twist to it, and I'm known for taking those types of records and bridging that gap between what we do and what they do," [...] he explained, dropping in a couple of examples. [...] "From M.I.A.'s 'Paper Planes' to 'Swagga Like Us,' we took [...] 'Gypsy Woman' for 'Why You Wanna.'" [...] Over the drum-heavy sample, Lamar and Bobby Ray join T.I. in sharing some nostalgic stories, which he says reminds him of some of a few renowned MCs and their classic projects: [...] " [...] taking turns on our story about a female that we knew years, years, years ago before we were who we are today. It kinda <b>puts</b> <b>me</b> in the mind of the 'Da Art Of Storytellin' [...] from Outkast and Slick Rick. It <b>puts</b> <b>me</b> in the mind of that." [...] The song, which failed to make the album's final track listing probably due to sample clearances, is titled [...] "Memories Back Then". On December 17, 2012 T.I. stopped by Sway Calloway's Sway In The Morning radio show to promote the album, while there he premiered [...] "Memories Back Then".|$|E
