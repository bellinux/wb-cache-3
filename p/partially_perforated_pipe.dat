40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} time-domain computational {{fluid dynamics}} approach is employed to calculate and analyze the sound attenuation behavior of water-filled <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> silencers. Transmission loss predictions from the time-domain {{computational fluid dynamics}} approach and the frequency-domain finite element method agree well {{with each other for}} the straight-through and cross-flow <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> silencers without flow. Then, the time-domain computational fluid dynamics approach is used to investigate the effects of flow velocity, diameter, and porosity of orifices on the sound attenuation behavior of the silencers. The numerical predictions demonstrate that the flow increases the transmission loss, especially at high frequencies. Based on the above analysis, <b>partially</b> plugged straight-through <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> silencer is proposed to improve the sound attenuation performance by increasing the flow velocity through the orifices. In order to eliminate the pass frequency of the <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> silencers and improve the sound attenuation performance in mid- to high-frequency range, a folded straight-through <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> silencer is designed and its sound attenuation behavior is analyzed numerically using the time-domain computational fluid dynamics approach...|$|R

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of appreciating the state of {{groundwater}} in the paddy field, a <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> has been inserted and the water level in it has been observed. In case of saturated flow in the ponding paddy field, there are some cases where the water level in the <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> {{does not mean the}} groundwater level. Physical meaning of this water level in this case has not been defined. The {{purpose of this study is}} to point out that the water level in the <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> can be obtained under the boundary conditions of the seepage flow region and the condition that the inflowrate into the <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> equals the outflowrate out of it. The authors propose the model of this situation in Fig. 1. In this study the following assumptions are mainly used. (1) The soil is homogeneous and the seepage flow obeys Darcy’s law. (2) The solution of the two-dimensional problem can be applied to the case of the <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> which is intrinsically a three-dimensional problem. (3) At the part of the strainer above the water surface in the <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> the velocity potential follows the equation φ=πA/ 2 y. The solution of this problem is obtained by solving Laplace’s equation under the boundary conditions with the theory of conformal mapping. In case of the water level above the part of the strainer in the <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe,</b> the ratio of H_ 1 to H_ 2 is obtained by the equation (6) and in case of the water level at the part of the strainer it is obtained by the equation (15). From the equations it becomes evident that the ratio of H_ 1 to H_ 2 is constant under the conditions that the location of the strainer part is fixed and in addition in the latter case, the location of the water surface in the <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> is fixed. The comparisons of the calculated results with the experimental results are shown in Figs. 6, 7, 9 and 10. In the former figures, experimental values almost coincide with the theoretical results. And as is evident from the latters figures, experimental values agree well with the theoretical results in the neighborhood of the values of H_ 1 and H_ 2 at which the seepage face is face is formed at the part of the strainer above the water surface in the <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe.</b> As a results, it can be considered that the assumptions used in this study are practically valid. But the validity of the third assumption is the subject for a future study. Lastly, the authors propose the equations (16) and (17) to approximately obtain the water depth in the <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> with the values of the pressure head in the soil at upper end and lower end of the strainer part. Experimental values agree well with the theoretical results (Fig. 12) ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Perforated</b> <b>pipes</b> {{are used}} widely in {{vertical}} and horizontal production wellbores. Understanding the fluid flow behaviour through <b>perforated</b> <b>pipes</b> by taking into consideration the wall inflow is crucial for determining the wellbore frictional characteristics. Accurate prediction of pressure drop along the <b>perforated</b> <b>pipes</b> is a key step in completion design of production wellbores. Many empirical and theoretical models {{have been reported in}} the literature to predict pressure drop and friction factor along <b>perforated</b> <b>pipes.</b> However, these models show contradictory findings which is resulted from variations in the wall inflow configuration and modelling assumptions. The fluid flow through the surrounding formation and its interactions with wellbore have been simplified in the previous models which limits their range of applicability. In this study, a three-dimensional integrated reservoir-wellbore model of fluid flow through a <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> surrounded by porous media is developed via Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. The model is used to investigate the effect of perforation parameters including perforation density, diameter and phasing angle on the wall friction factor and the pressure drop along the <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe.</b> The simulations are carried out for pipe inlet velocities of 0. 5, 2. 5, and 5 m/s with inflow to pipe flow rate ratios of 0, 7. 5, 15, 30 %. The results from this study show that the friction factor varies linearly with the perforation density but does not change remarkably with the perforation diameter or phasing. The observed trends of wall friction factor with perforation parameters are further explained and confirmed by studying the local wall shear stress results. Increasing the number of perforations leads to a higher friction factor as well as a larger pressure drop along the pipe. It is also observed that for perforation phasing angle of 90 °, the overall pressure drop has the highest value compared to other phasing angles due to intensified influence of mixing pressure drop. For turbulent flows with high Reynolds number, the accelerational pressure drop is more dominant than the frictional and mixing pressure drop for the same inflow to pipe flow rate ratios. The developed model provides an alternative solution to experimental studies of <b>perforated</b> <b>pipes,</b> while delivering more details on friction factor behaviour and overall pressure drop components...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 <b>Perforated</b> <b>pipes</b> {{were buried}} in the gravel bed of a {{laboratory}} stream, extending upstream from a simulated riffle in order to study their effect upon mixing and interchange of stream water and intragravel water. In {{the absence of such}} pipes the drop of energy gradient of the stream was concentrated locally at the riffle whereas the <b>perforated</b> <b>pipes</b> caused the local drop of hydraulic gradient to occur over an extensive portion of the gravel bed due to the direct connection of the pipes with the flow downstream of the riffle. The resulting increase in interchange of stream and intragravel water would be directly beneficial to fish eggs and hatched fry in the gravel pore space by permitting a greater supply of dissolved oxygen to reach them and thus reducing the risk of suffocation.

40|$|In {{measuring}} the groundwater level with a <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe,</b> the water surface may be {{formed in the}} pipe even if the groundwater table does not exist under the ground. In {{the case with the}} existence of the groundwater table, the groundwater flow is disturbed due to the flow in the pipe. And inversely the water level in the pipe belongs to this disturbed groundwater flow. Thus, {{there is a possibility that}} the water level in the pipe may not be regarded as the true level of groundwater. In this paper, the variations of the flow and level of the groundwater were analyzed in the case of a <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> which is installed in a three-dimensional groundwater flow. At first, the physical meaning of the water level in a <b>perforated</b> <b>pipe</b> installed in the paddy field was studied and it was confirmed that the water surface in the pipe is located at the level where the inflow rate into the pipe equals to the outflow rate out of it. This mechanism may be valid for the pipe installed in various types of groundwater flow. In consideration of this mechanism, the influences of the radius and length of the pipe upon the variations of the groundwater flow were investigated. It was concluded that the variations become greater with the larger radius of the pipe, with the deeper depth of the pipe below the groundwater and in the case of the steeper slope of the groundwater table. パイプによる地下水位測定のとき,地下水面が地下に存在しない場合もパイプ内に水面が生じるばかりでなく,たとえ地下水面が存在する場合でも地下水流があるときはパイプ内の水の流れによって乱された地下水流に対応した,自然の地下水位とは異なる位置にパイプ内に水面が生じる. パイプ内に水面が形成される機構に関する考え方にもとづいて 3 次元自由面地下水流の場合におけるパイプによる地下水流,地下水位分布の乱れの大きさについて解析した. この結果パイプの径が大きく,設置深さが深くそして地下水面の勾配が大きい程乱れは大きいこと,パイプによる乱れは上流側で地下水位の低下,下流側では上昇となってあらわれることがわかった...|$|R
