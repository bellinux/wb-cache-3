5|$|As Barksdale's men pushed toward Sickles's {{headquarters}} {{near the}} Trostle barn, the general {{and his staff}} began {{to move to the}} rear, when a cannonball caught Sickles in the right leg. He was carried off in a stretcher, sitting up and <b>puffing</b> on his cigar, attempting to encourage his men. That evening his leg was amputated, and he returned to Washington, D.C. Gen. Birney assumed command of the III Corps, which was soon rendered ineffective as a fighting force.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit body}} remains closed until shortly before spore discharge; {{dehiscence}} (fruit body opening) {{is caused by}} the pressure exerted by swollen paraphyses—sterile (i.e., non-reproductive) cells that are interspersed between the ascospores. Dehiscence is accompanied by the release of clouds of spores, resembling smoke. The spore <b>puffing</b> upon rupture is thought to be caused by the sudden change in relative humidity between the interior chamber of the fruit body and the outside environment. Dehiscence is accompanied by a hissing sound, an auditory phenomenon known to occur in about fifteen other fungal species.|$|E

5|$|Their {{repertoire}} of vocalisations is also large; variations in intensity and pitch, rather than discrete signals, appear central to communication. Most lion vocals are variations of growling/snarling, miaowing and roaring. Other sounds produced include purring, <b>puffing,</b> bleating and humming. Lions tend to roar {{in a very}} characteristic manner, starting with a few deep, long roars that trail off {{into a series of}} shorter ones.|$|E
5|$|These snakes {{do well in}} captivity, {{but there}} are reports of gluttony. Kauffeld (1969) {{mentions}} that specimens can be maintained for years on only one meal per week, but that when offered all they can eat, the result is often death, or at best wholesale regurgitation. They are bad-tempered snakes and some specimens never settle down in captivity, always hissing and <b>puffing</b> when approached.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-6b {{is a hot}} Jupiter, {{having a}} mass 0.669 times that of Jupiter, but an average {{distance}} of only 0.046 AU from its star and, thus, an orbital period of 3.23 days. It is almost 10 times closer to its star than Mercury is from our Sun. As a result, Kepler-6b is strongly irradiated by its star, heating its atmosphere to a temperature of 1660 K and <b>puffing</b> {{it up to a}} size 1.3 times that of Jupiter. It may also be the case that Kepler-6b has a thermal inversion of its atmosphere, where temperature increases with increasing distance {{from the center of the}} planet. However, additional observations are required to confirm or refute this possibility.|$|E

5|$|During group interactions, Galapagos {{sharks are}} {{dominant}} to blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) but deferent to silvertip sharks (C. albimarginatus) of equal size. When confronted or cornered, the Galapagos shark may perform a threat display {{similar to that}} of the grey reef shark, in which the shark performs an exaggerated, rolling swimming motion while arching its back, lowering its pectoral fins, <b>puffing</b> out its gills, and gaping its jaw. The shark may also swing its head from side to side, so as to keep the perceived threat within its field of vision. A known parasite of the Galapagos shark is the flatworm Dermophthirius carcharhini, which attaches to the shark's skin. In one account, a bluefin trevally (Caranax melampygus) was seen rubbing against the rough skin of a Galapagos shark to rid itself of parasites.|$|E
5|$|Quatre Bras was a hamlet at a {{strategic}} crossroads {{on the road}} to Brussels. French control of it would not only threaten the city, but divide Wellington's allied army from Blucher's Prussians. At 14:00 on 16 June 1815, after some initial skirmishing, the main French force under Marshall Ney, approached Quatre Bras from the south. They came up against the 2nd Netherlands Division who had formed a line well in advance of the crossroads. Facing three French infantry divisions and a cavalry brigade, the Dutch and Nassau troops were forced back but did not break. Reinforcements arrived at 15:00, being a Dutch cavalry brigade, Picton's 5th British Division, followed closely by the Brunswick Corps. The sharpshooters of the Brunswick Advance Guard regiment were sent to support Dutch skirmishers in Bossou Wood on the allied right (western) flank; the rest of the corps took up a reserve position across the Brussels road. The Duke reassured his inexperienced troops by walking up and down in front of them, calmly <b>puffing</b> on his pipe.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season {{varies according to}} latitude, taking place from April to July in Queensland, January to May in northern New South Wales, December to February in southern New South Wales, and October to February in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The male yellow-tailed black cockatoo courts by <b>puffing</b> up crest and spreading his tail feathers to display his yellow plumage. Softly growling, he approaches the female and bows {{three or four times}} to her. His eye ring may also flush a deeper pink. Nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of tall trees, generally eucalypts, which are either living or dead. Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. The same tree may be used for many years. A 1994 study of nesting sites in Eucalyptus regnans forest in the Strzelecki Ranges in eastern Victoria found the average age of trees used for hollows by the yellow-tailed black cockatoo to be 228 years. The authors noted that the proposed 80–150 year rotation time for managed forests would impact on the numbers of suitable trees.|$|E

5|$|The male red-tailed black {{cockatoo}} courts by <b>puffing</b> up crest and cheek feathers, {{and hiding}} the beak; it then sings and struts, {{ending in a}} jump and a flash of red tail feathers toward the female who will most often reply by defensively biting him. Breeding generally takes place from May to September except {{in the case of}} the South-eastern subspecies, which nests during summer (December to February). Pairs of the subspecies samueli in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia may produce two broods, while those of South-eastern subspecies only produce one. Nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of tall trees. Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. The same tree may be used for many years. Hollows can be 1 to 2metres (3–7ft) deep and 0.25–0.5metres (10–20in) wide, with a base of woodchips. A clutch consists of 1 to 2 white, lustreless eggs, although the second chick is in most cases neglected and perishes in infancy.|$|E

25|$|In 1813, William Hedley and Timothy Hackworth {{designed}} a locomotive (<b>Puffing</b> Billy) {{for use on}} the tramway between Stockton and Darlington. <b>Puffing</b> Billy featured piston rods extending upwards to pivoting beams, connected in turn by rods to a crankshaft beneath the frames which, in turn, drove the gears attached to the wheels. This meant that the wheels were coupled, allowing better traction.

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Puffs</b> {{are local}} Ca 2 þ signals that arise by Ca 2 þ liberation from the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum through concerted opening of tightly clustered inositol trisphosphate receptor/channels (IP 3 R). They serve both local signaling functions and trigger global Ca 2 þ waves. The numbers of functional IP 3 R within clusters differ appreciably between different <b>puff</b> sites, and we investigated how {{the probability of}} <b>puff</b> occurrence varies with cluster size. We imaged <b>puffs</b> in SH-SY 5 Y cells using total internal fluorescence microscopy, and estimated cluster sizes from {{the magnitude of the}} largest <b>puff</b> observed at each site relative to the signal from a single channel. We find that the initial triggering rate of <b>puffs</b> following photorelease of IP 3, and the average frequency of subsequent repetitive <b>puffs,</b> vary about linearly with cluster size. These data accord well with stochastic simulations in which opening of any individual IP 3 R channel within a cluster triggers a <b>puff</b> via Ca 2 þ-induced Ca 2 þ release. An important consequence is that the signaling power of a <b>puff</b> site (average amount of Ca 2 þ released per <b>puff</b> <b>puff</b> frequency) varies about the square of cluster size, implying that large clusters contribute disproportionately to cellular signaling and, because of their higher <b>puff</b> frequency, preferentially act as pacemakers to initiate Ca 2 þ waves...|$|R
30|$|It also {{is unknown}} whether the {{increases}} in standard smoking machine yields of these compounds have any biological relevance. Humans smoke their cigarettes differently from a standard smoking machine (Borgerding & Klus 2005); thus, smoking topography (i.e., total <b>puff</b> volume, <b>puff</b> count, <b>puff</b> velocity, duration of <b>puff</b> and <b>puff</b> interval) {{would be a more}} appropriate method to estimate any possible change in smoking behaviour (Pauly et al. 2009; Mariner & Shepperd 2011).|$|R
25|$|In {{religious}} and magical practice, insufflation and exsufflation are ritual acts of blowing, breathing, hissing, or <b>puffing</b> that signify variously expulsion or renunciation of evil {{or of the}} devil (the Evil One), or infilling or blessing with good (especially, in religious use, with the Spirit or grace of God).|$|E

40|$|The {{velocity}} field of isolated turbulent <b>puffs</b> {{was measured using}} the particle image velocimetry technique and was compared with the steady jet flow field. <b>Puffs</b> were generated by injecting air through a 5 mm diameter nozzle into a flow chamber with a weak coflow. Isolated <b>puffs</b> with a Reynolds number of 5000 were examined {{in the range of}} 40 ??? 75 diameters downstream of the nozzle. The injection time was varied in order to assess the effects of injection volume and equivalent stroke ratio on the <b>puff</b> structure. The results from phase-locked measurements indicate that as the injection volume increased, <b>puffs</b> elongated in the axial direction and became similar to starting jets in the range considered. The largest scaled fluctuating velocities and turbulent shear stress within the <b>puffs</b> were twice the steady jet values. Inspection of the vorticity field revealed the presence of vorticity throughout the <b>puff</b> volume. Entrainment takes place on the portion of the <b>puff</b> closest to the nozzle and the entrainment rate is greater for the <b>puffs</b> with the smaller injection volume. This is consistent with the observations of rapid mixing and combustion of <b>puffs</b> in previous studies...|$|R
40|$|<b>Puff</b> pastry is {{a popular}} nonleavened pastry product with unique textural properties. <b>Puff</b> pastry is {{processed}} from laminated dough, comprising alternating and discrete layers of dough and fat. <b>Puff</b> pastry quality can vary substantially depending on the raw material quality and production processes.
