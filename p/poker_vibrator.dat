Concrete specimens, of diameter about 106 mm (D) and height about 1000 mm (H), were formed during the experiment. The ratio of height and diameter H/D was 9. 4. Concrete mixture, placed in forms, was compacted by <b>poker</b> <b>vibrator,</b> when vibrating element was placed to the top part of the form. Different time was used for compacting mixture in forms: 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 s. The study results show the changes in density and compressive strength of samples (radius about 106 mm and height about 100 mm) depending on the location of the sample in specimen (1000 mm height). It was found, that samples taken from different height of the specimen had different density and compressive strength...|$|E
