2500|$|Boian {{archaeological sites}} {{have tended to}} be found next to rivers and lakes that had rich {{floodplains}} that provided fertile soil for agriculture. There were three different types of structures found in Boian sites. During Boian phases I and II the dwellings of this culture were thrown-together, oval-shaped lean-to or dugout pit-house shelters built into river banks and ledges. In Boian phases III and IV the dwellings became more sophisticated, resulting in structures that were small with raised wooden <b>platform</b> <b>floors.</b> The third type of houses were larger, rectangular (up to 7 by 3.5 meters, or 23 by 11.5 feet) wattle and daub structures with wooden <b>platform</b> <b>floors</b> covered in clay, and roughly-thatched roofs, built at ground level.|$|R

40|$|The station {{under study}} is a typical {{underground}} mass rapid transit station with concourse and <b>platform</b> <b>floors,</b> exhibits atrium type of space at parts of the building. The performance of the smoke management system was studied by computer modeling using FDS version 3. 10. The fire sizes of 2. 5 MW and 1. 0 MW were used respectively for the concourse and the <b>platform</b> <b>floors.</b> Smoke management performance was studied for fires at three different locations. NFPA standard 130 {{was used to evaluate}} the safe escape of the passengers. Temperature, visibility, CO concentration, and radiation flux intensity are the important parameters for evaluating the tenable conditions at the escape route during the allowable evacuation time. It has been found in this study that visibility of smoke is the key factor for safe escape of the personnel in an underground station. It is also concluded that proper smoke exhaust design can maintain a tenable environment for safe evacuation. The smoke management design and the operation procedure as simulated in this study are also compliant to the building and fire codes of Taiwan...|$|R

After completion, the station will have a height of more than 40 metres, which will be higher than the Alandur metro rail elevated station where the two corridors of Phase I of the Chennai Metro Rail (viz.

5000|$|The Altiplano, {{the high}} plateau between the {{previous}} range and the Cordillera Oriental, comprises four major basins formed by mountainous spurs that jut eastward from the Cordillera Occidental about {{halfway to the}} Cordillera Oriental. Along the Altiplano's eastern side is a continuous flat area, which has served as Bolivia's principal north-south transport corridor since colonial times. The entire Altiplano was originally a deep rift between the cordilleras that gradually filled with highly porous sedimentary debris washed down from the peaks. This sedimentary origin explains its gradual slope from north to south; greater rainfall in the north has washed a larger quantity of debris onto the <b>platform</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
50|$|The main living {{areas of}} the house, being raised from the terrain, {{are a series of}} rooms on a <b>platform</b> <b>floor.</b> Traditionally, {{planning}} and fenestration encouraged cross-ventilation for passive cooling in a variety of innovative methods including fanlights, ceiling roses, and alignment of doors and windows to allow uninterrupted air flow. The verandah is the most typical inclusion in the plan and can be used day and night as a semi-external living space. In Brisbane, many people have tables and chairs for dining and a daybed or 'sleepout' on their verandah. Revolving tin cylinders placed on roofs allow for hot air to be drawn out of ceiling spaces.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With {{more and}} more subway lines in cities, people have pay much {{attention}} to the comfortable quality of subway vibration, especially in transfer stations or stations that have more than one line which <b>platform</b> and <b>floor</b> have much violent vibration. The paper bases on a subway station with multiple trains, builds the finite model, puts measured wheel-rail force as the load and gets the dynamic responses. Then it accords conventional international standard of comfortable quality which uses weighted root mean square acceleration as index to evaluate the comfortable quality of <b>platform</b> and <b>floor</b> or other areas. The result shows: The station could meet the requirement of comfortable quality...|$|R

50|$|Named {{after the}} {{electric}} light bulb factory nearby, the preliminary layout included Schuko's {{idea of making}} the ceiling covered with six rows of circular incandescent inset lamps (of which there were 318 in total). However the outbreak of World War II halted all works until 1943 when construction resumed. Gelfreich and Rozhin finished the design by adding an addition theme to the station the struggle of the home front during the war, which is highlighted by the 12 marble bas-reliefs on the pylons done by Georgiy Motovilov. The rest of the station's interior features most of the 1930s plans including powder-ballada marble on the rectangular pylons (the outside faces have sconces and decorative gilded grilles depicting the hammer and sickle), red salietti marble on the station walls, a dark olive duvalu marble on the socle and a chessboard layout on the main <b>platform</b> <b>floor</b> of granite and labradorite.|$|E
50|$|The north half of {{the open}} {{intermediate}} level mezzanine was designed to eventually become a station of the unbuilt IND Worth Street Line. A locked door, located in {{the north end of}} the mezzanine, reveals additional closed platform space and an electrical room that hides the rest of the trackway and platform space. In this closed space, the <b>platform</b> <b>floor</b> drops to the level of the intended westbound trackway for the unbuilt line. The unused space runs for no more than fifteen feet before ending at a solid wall. Another door that leads to the electrical room hides the eastbound trackway. Near the north end of this station, a different ceiling structure angling across marks where the unbuilt subway would have gone. The ramp that descends from the full-time side would have led to the same intermediate level, with a station facility in between, but that was never constructed. On the open intermediate level's mezzanine, the unusual spacing of some of the pillars marks where the line's platforms would have been placed. The closed trackways are also accessible through the closed intermediate level mezzanine, though this level is somewhat lower than that of the trackways.|$|E
