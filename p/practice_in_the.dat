5|$|A 2007 {{study of}} young chess {{players in the}} United Kingdom found that strong players tended to have above-average IQ scores, but, within that group, the {{correlation}} between chess skill and IQ was moderately negative, meaning that smarter children tended to achieve {{a lower level of}} chess skill. This result was explained by a negative correlation between intelligence and <b>practice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elite subsample, and by practice having a higher influence on chess skill.|$|E
