5000|$|Barden {{was founded}} by Theodore Barth and Carl Norden (hence the name [...] "Bar-den") in 1942 to make {{precision}} ball bearings for the Norden bombsight. The Norden bombsight required 61 precision miniature and instrument type bearings. Prior to the US entry into World War II, bombsight production levels were planned to be 800 per month; however after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, production was ramped up and reached roughly 2000 units per month by the close of 1943. [...] The <b>precision</b> <b>level</b> of the bearings required for the bombsight to operate was not available in the domestic bearing industry, driving the creation of Barden.

50|$|Target {{aperture}} sights {{are designed}} for maximum precision. The rear sight element (often called diopter) is usually a large disk (up to 1 inch or 2.5 cm in diameter) with a small hole in the middle, and is placed close to the shooter's eye. High end target diopters normally accept accessories like adjustable diopter aperture and optical filter systems to ensure optimal sighting conditions for match shooters. Typical modern target shooting diopters offer windage and elevation corrections in 2 mm to 4 mm increments at 100 m. Some International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) (Olympic) shooting events require this <b>precision</b> <b>level</b> for sighting lines, since the final score of the top competitors last shots series is expressed in tenths of scoring ring points.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>precision</b> <b>level</b> (1:24000) is used {{to check}} the {{installation}} of precision machine tools in two axes. A lathe is manufactured with its base in a level plane {{and if it is}} not installed level distortions in the frame cause machining errors. Small milling machines are often roughly leveled but large mills are installed level. A worn lathe may have a twist introduced to the machine's bed to ensure that it turns parallel to the spindle axis, by twisting the bed (that is worn) to the spindle axis. A lathe has several leveling screws. Usually, such a fix has limited utility for only part of the cutting tool (carriage) travel. A lathe usually requires two or more leveling trials as the machine castings [...] "settle into" [...] the adjustments.|$|E
5000|$|The Fell All-Way <b>precision</b> <b>level,</b> one of {{the first}} {{successful}} American made bull's eye levels for machine tool use, was invented by William B.

The level was so accurate it was restricted from export during World War II. The device set a new standard of [...]0005 inches per foot resolution (five ten thousands per foot or five arc seconds tilt). The level's production stopped around 1970. Production restarted in the 1980s by Thomas Butler Technology, Rockford, Illinois, but finally ended in the mid 1990s. However, there are still hundreds of the highly prized devices in existence.|$|E
50|$|Besides the {{standard}} entered information the actual internal volume or cartridge case {{capacity of the}} used cases is an important parameter for QuickLOAD to obtain usable predictions. The internal case volume has to be established by weighing empty once fired cartridge cases from a production lot and filling the cases with fresh or distilled water (H2O) {{up to the point}} of overflowing and weighing the water filled cases. The added weight of the water is then used to establish the liquid volume and hence the case capacity. This liquid volume measurement method can be practically employed to about a 0.01 to 0.02 ml or 0.15 to 0.30 grains of water <b>precision</b> <b>level</b> for fire arms cartridge cases. A case capacity establishment should best be done by measuring several fired cases from a particular production lot and calculating their average case capacity.

ESPRESSO will benefit {{not only from the}} much larger combined light-collecting capacity of the four 8.2-metre VLT Unit Telescopes, but also from improvements in the stability and calibration accuracy that are now possible (for example, laser frequency comb technology). The requirement is to reach 10 cm/s, but the aimed goal is to obtain a <b>precision</b> <b>level</b> of a few cm/s. This would mean a large step forward over current radial-velocity spectrographs like ESO's HARPS. The HARPS instrument can attain a precision of 97 cm/s (3.5 km/h), with an effective precision of the order of 30 cm/s, making it one of only two instruments worldwide with such accuracy. The ESPRESSO would greatly exceed this capability making detection of earth-like planets from ground based instruments possible.

5000|$|The {{approximate}} {{number system}} (ANS) is a cognitive system {{that supports the}} estimation {{of the magnitude of}} a group without relying on language or symbols. The ANS is credited with the non-symbolic representation of all numbers greater than four, with lesser values being carried out by the parallel individuation system, or object tracking system. Beginning in early infancy, the ANS allows an individual to detect differences in magnitude between groups. The precision of the ANS improves throughout childhood development and reaches a final adult level of approximately 15% accuracy, meaning an adult could distinguish 100 items versus 115 items without counting. [...] The ANS plays a crucial role in development of other numerical abilities, such as the concept of exact number and simple arithmetic.
