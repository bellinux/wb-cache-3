Marsden spots him when his phone rings; two officers chase him to the roof, where he stumbles and falls to his death. The investigation ends, since the <b>police</b> <b>believe</b> that Bradley had killed Archie; however, his killer was actually Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner).|$|E

25|$|Police {{officers}} are legally permitted to use force, and their superiors — {{and the public}} — expect them to do so.
