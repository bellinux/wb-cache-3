5|$|The flesh in {{the gills}} is {{composed}} of cylindrical hyphae measuring between 4 and 8μm thick that run parallel to one another. The hyphae typically have fairly thin, smooth walls, but {{they can have a}} small amount of brown pigment, which stains orange-brown in <b>potassium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> The pileipellis, the uppermost layer of hyphae in the cap, forms a cutis made up of cylindrical, slightly thicker-walled hyphae of between 5 and 10μm wide. They can be interwoven or primarily extending from the margin to the centre. The pigmentation is yellowish-brown and stains reddish-brown in <b>potassium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> The hyphae below the pileipellis run parallel to one another and measure between 4 and 8μm in width. Their yellowish-brown pigment stains orange-brown in <b>potassium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> The stipitipellis, the uppermost layer of hyphae on the stem, also forms a cutis. The cylindrical hyphae run parallel to one another and have thick cell walls. They have a dark red-brown pigment, which stains darker still in <b>potassium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> Clamp connections are present.|$|E
5|$|The lichen's cortex and medulla react {{positively}} with <b>potassium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> (K), turning yellow.

Any strong base capable of deprotonating the alcohol will do (e.g. NaOH, KOH, sodium methoxide, etc.), but the sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>hydroxides</b> are often chosen for their cost.

25|$|Hydrogen bonding causes pure ethanol to be {{hygroscopic}} to {{the extent}} that it readily absorbs water from the air. The polar nature of the hydroxyl group causes ethanol to dissolve many ionic compounds, notably sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>hydroxides,</b> magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, ammonium chloride, ammonium bromide, and sodium bromide. Sodium and potassium chlorides are slightly soluble in ethanol. Because the ethanol molecule also has a nonpolar end, it will also dissolve nonpolar substances, including most essential oils and numerous flavoring, coloring, and medicinal agents.|$|R

40|$|AbstractExtraction of {{titanium}} and chromium oxides may {{be achieved}} via roasting the respective minerals with alkali at high temperatures, followed by water and organic acid leaching. In this study, sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>hydroxides</b> {{are used as}} alkali for roasting of chromite ores and ilmenite mineral concentrates. The thermodynamic analysis of the roasting process is {{discussed in terms of}} designing the process. Samples of chromite and titaniferous minerals were roasted with NaOH and KOH in a temperature range of 400 °C– 1000 °C in an oxidising atmosphere. The roasted chromite and ilmenite samples were further processed in order to extract water-soluble Na 2 CrO 4 from the reacted chromite and purify titanium dioxide from titaniferous minerals, respectively. The TiO 2 purity obtained after roasting at 400 °C with NaOH and double leaching was 49. 2 wt. %, whereas when using KOH the purity was 54. 5 wt. %. The highest TiO 2 purity obtained after roasting at 1000 °C for 2 h and double leaching with water and organic acids was 84 wt. %. At low temperature (400 °C) the recovery of chromium was higher for chromite roasted with KOH than for chromite roasted with NaOH. However, at high temperatures (700 °C and 1000 °C) chromium recoveries were similar when roasting with both hydroxides.

40|$|The {{elemental}} {{and chemical}} wood ash compositions of six dominant Greek fuels was investigated {{using a variety}} of techniques, including thermal gravimetric analysis (TG), differential thermal analysis (DTA), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). In addition, the alkalinity of wood ash was determined by titration. The ash was prepared by combustion at low (600 degrees C), middle (800 degrees C) and high temperatures (1000 degrees C). The ash composition is very important because thousands of hectares of wildlands are burned annually in Greece. The resulting deposits affect soil properties (i. e., pH) and provide a source of inorganic constituents (i. e., Ca, K, Na, Mg, etc.), while the most soluble compounds (i. e., sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>hydroxides</b> and carbonates) do not persist through the wet season.
