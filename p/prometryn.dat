Further, the method is applicable in clams. The separation condition for GC-MS was optimized by using a DB- 5 MS capillary column (30 m× 0. 25 mm, 0. 25 µm) with helium as the carrier gas, at a flow rate of 0. 9 mL/min.

Embora os herbicidas diuron, {{oxyfluorfen}} e prometryne sejam opções para uso nessa cultura, há informações limitadas referentes à eficácia desses herbicidas no controle de Euphorbia heterophylla. O objetivo do presente trabalho foi determinar a curva de dose-resposta de diuron, oxyfluorfen e prometryne para o controle de E. heterophylla, bem como analisar a eficiência biológica de misturas desses herbicidas no manejo dessa espécie. O trabalho foi composto por seis experimentos conduzidos simultaneamente em casa de vegetação, sendo três deles com doses crescentes de cada herbicida aplicado isoladamente e três compostos por misturas dos herbicidas dois a dois. A curva de dose-resposta foi ajustada para os dados das avaliações de porcentagem de redução de massa seca aos 28 dias após a aplicação. Determinoaram-se as doses I 80 e I 95, que correspondem ao controle de 80 % e 95 %, respectivamente, de controle visual ou redução da massa seca. Diuron, oxyfluorfen e prometryne, aplicados isoladamente, mostraram-se eficientes, dentro do intervalo de doses utilizado, no controle de E. heterophylla. As misturas contendo oxyfluorfen apresentaram-se, de modo geral, como aditivas ou antagonísticas, ao passo que misturas de diuron+prometryne foram aditivas ou sinergísticas.

Cotton stand counts were highest when only pendimethalin was applied or when no herbicide was used. Tank mixing <b>prometryn</b> with pendimethalin did not significantly reduce plant populations. Tank mixing increasing amounts of norflurazon with pendimethalin resulted in decreasing plant populations in both the wet and the dry plant experiments. Tank mixing increasing rates of norflurazon with both pendimethalin and <b>prometryn</b> caused a similar decline in plant populations in both the wet and the dry plant experiments.

40|$|Two field {{investigations}} were {{undertaken to}} study the role of water table management in reducing herbicide pollution of ground water. One of the three-year studies (1992 - 1995) was conducted in a sandy field near Joliette (Laurin farm), (Quebec) to monitor the herbicide metribuzin where potatoes were grown. Two water table management systems were evaluated, namely subsurface drainage and subirrigation. Soil and ground water samples were taken at two week intervals, once before and six times after the herbicide application. The amount of rainfall received {{in the first few}} weeks following herbicide application is crucial in assessing the extent of ground water contamination. In 1992, fewer rainfall events occurred after the application as compared to 1993, so metribuzin leached slowly. In 1992, it appears that subirrigation reduced ground water contamination by a factor of 10 through enhanced degradation and the greater effect of dilution. However, the role of subirrigation in reducing the metribuzin contamination of ground water was negligible in 1993 due to considerable leaching soon after the application. The second project was conducted in an organic soil in St-Patrice-de-Sherrington (Van Winden farm) where the herbicide <b>prometryn</b> was studied. Surface irrigation with a controlled water table was also used as a water table management system. One experimental unit was used {{for each of the three}} treatments (subirrigation, surface irrigation and subsurface drainage). The herbicide application rate was greater at the Van Winden farm than in the Laurin farm (5. 5 kg/ha versus 1. 0 kg/ha).

The effect of subirrigation in reducing ground water contamination was significant when the water table was shallow. <b>Prometryn</b> degradation was relatively slow during the summer.

40|$|The {{importance}} of extremely slow retention and release has superseded {{the notion that}} sorption of pesticides to soil is an instantaneous and reversible process. A fraction of sorbed pesticide is also often reported to bind irreversibly to the soil matrix. This {{has important implications for}} pesticide mobility and bioavailability. It is essential to understand sorption phenomena to allow accurate prediction of pesticide fate within the soil environment. This thesis describes the result of applying a sequential extraction procedure, based on the principles of isotope or “self-exchange”, to nine pesticide/soil systems. The significance of irreversible sorption in controlling pesticide mobility was assessed using isotope exchange (12 C and 14 C) to characterise pesticide exchange kinetics in-situ over protracted time-scales. Sequential extraction increased in harshness in the order: isotope exchange <b>prometryn</b> (≤ 1. 35 ± 0. 60 %) > hexaconazole (≤ 0. 50 ± 0. 06 %). Varying the soil composition had little effect on amounts of irreversibly sorbed pesticide, probably due to the small amounts of irreversible sorption observed overall. These results suggest {{that the vast majority of}} sorbed chlorotoluron, <b>prometryn</b> and hexaconazole (in the parent form) participated in very slow but reversible binding, a result also confirmed by the three-site sorption model. Pesticide sorption behaviour is a complex process. Although sorption phenomena are still not fully understood, these results provide a greater insight into the significance of irreversible binding for predicting pesticide fate.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{increase}} in the area planted with Crotalaria spectabilishas occurred by several factors, highlighting the potential to reduce the nematodes, nitrogen fixation and the high production of biomass. By becoming a species sown as a crop, {{it is necessary to}} control the weeds that coexist with showy crotalaria. This change in the use of this crop creates the possibility of this specie becoming a weed. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the potential use of herbicides applied in preemergence and postemergence of C. spectabilisfor different purposes (control of volunteer and selectivity plants). Three experiments were installed in a greenhouse (two with herbicides applied in preemergence - in soils with distinct textural categories; and one experiment with herbicides applied in postemergence). The results of the experiments with herbicides applied in preemergence showed that: amicarbazone, atrazine, diuron, metribuzin, <b>prometryn,</b> fomesafen and sulfentrazone showed effectiveness for control of C. spectabilis in clayey soil. Besides these, flumioxazin and isoxaflutole also showed potential to be used in the control of showy crotalaria in soils with loam texture. In relation to the postemergence herbicides, atrazine, diuron, <b>prometryn,</b> flumioxazin, fomesafen, lactofen, saflufenacil, amonio-glufosinate and glyphosate can be used aiming the chemical control of C. spectabilis. Herbicides chlorimuron-ethyl, diclosulan, imazethapyr, pyrithiobac-sodium, trifloxysulfuron-sodium, clomazone, pendimethalin, S-metolachlor and trifluralin applied in preemergence, and imazethapyr, pyrithiobac-sodium, flumiclorac, bentazon and clethodim applied in postemergence caused low levels of injury to C. spectabilis plants, making necessary the development of new searches to ensure the selectivity of these products...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of volunteer potato Solanum tuberosum L., cutleaf nightshade, S. triflorum N., and hairy nightshade, S. physalifolium Rusby (Solanales: Solanaceae), throughout potato crop rotations can diminish {{the effectiveness of}} crop rotations designed to control disease and pest problems associated with growing potatoes. In greenhouse bioassays, larvae of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) were placed in population densities of 0, 5, 10, and 40 per potato (cv. Russet Burbank) plant and 0, 5, 10, and 15 per cutleaf nightshade and hairy nightshade plant. Plants were treated with different rates of herbicides including fluroxypyr, <b>prometryn,</b> and mesotrione rates, and the physiological response on the potato plants was assessed by weighing shoot biomass 14 days after treatment. Consistently, across all bioassays, rate response functions were shifted as L. decemlineata density increased, such that less herbicide was required to achieve control. For instance, the herbicide rate needed to achieve 90 % reduction in potato biomass was reduced from 62 to 0 g fluroxypyr per hectare and 711 to 0 g <b>prometryn</b> per hectare as L. decemlineata density was increased to 40 larvae per plant. Herbivory at higher L. decemlineata population densities and herbicides above certain rates resulted in large reductions in cutleaf and hairy nightshade biomass. Differences in rate response functions among L. decemlineata population densities indicated that L. decemlineata contributed to weed suppression in combination with herbicides. These data suggest that integrated weed management systems targeting volunteer potato, cutleaf nightshade, and hairy nightshade can be more effective when herbicide applications are combined with herbivory by naturally occurring Colorado potato beetles...|$|E
40|$|In this study, Organonitrogen {{pesticides}} (ONPs) {{levels were}} determined in surface and groundwater samples from El-Rahawy {{area in the}} southwestern part of Nile Delta, Egypt. Gas Chromatography with Nitrogen Phosphorous Detector (GC-NPD) was proposed to determine the concentration of eleven ONPs, molinate, atrazine, simazine, prometon, propazine, <b>prometryn,</b> simetryn, ametryn, alachlor, terbutryn and metolachlor during winter and summer seasons. The most abundant components were molinate and propazine. The total concentrations of ONPs in the surface samples were from 3. 9636 to 75. 878 ng L- 1 while in groundwater were below the detection limit i. e. 0. 02 ng L- 1.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{capacity of}} powdered active carbons, {{used in a}} water treatment facility, {{for the removal of}} the triazine herbicides propazine, <b>prometryn</b> and prometon, was evaluated. Kinetic studies showed that some of the carbon samples used could be suitable in the practice for the treatment of moderate contents of the herbicides in contaminated waters. Equilibrium studies showed that the data fit the Frumkin isotherm. The results show that in the adsorption process there are repulsive lateral interactions seems to be established mainly between the isopropyl groups of adjacent molecules, being of the same order for the three molecules.

40|$|Abstract. An {{electrochemical}} DNA-biosensor {{has been}} used to investigate the interactions between DNA and members of a group of ten derivatives of 1, 3, 5 -triazine herbicides: chloro-s-triazines (atrazine, propazine, terbutylazin, and cyanazin), thiomethyl-s-triazines (ametryn, <b>prometryn,</b> terbutryn, and simetryn), and methoxy-s-triazines (prometon and terbumeton). A UV spectrophotometric study of this group of herbicides was also undertaken. Of this group only cyanazin could be oxidized in aqueous solution using a glassy carbon electrode. Use of the electrochemical DNA-biosensor revealed the occurrence of a time-dependent interaction of all the herbicides with DNA, via the appearance of guanine, guanosine, and adenosine oxidation signals that correspond to DNA damage. Adduct formation between the herbicide and the DNA purine bases guanine and adenine is suggested as a mechanism...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the Langmuir–Freundlich {{isotherm}} (LF) {{is used to}} characterise a propazine-imprinted polymer {{obtained by}} precipitation polymerisation (MIP-P). Different rebinding {{studies were carried out}} allowing to explain the different interactions taking place between the molecularly imprinted polymer and six triazinic herbicides (desisopropylatrazine, desethylatrazine, simazine, atrazine, propazine and <b>prometryn).</b> The LF fitting parameters obtained (total number of binding sites, heterogeneity index and mean binding affinity) were compared to those obtained in a previous work for a propazine-imprinted polymer prepared by bulk polymerisation (MIP-B). From that study, it was concluded that precipitation polymerisation yielded polymers with a more homogeneous binding site distribution and higher affinity constants.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{capacities of}} three low-cost granular active carbons, {{used in a}} water treatment facility {{for the removal of}} the triazine herbicides propazine, <b>prometryn</b> and prometon, was evaluated. Kinetic studies showed that the three carbon samples used could be suitable in practice for the treatment of moderate contents of the herbicides in contaminated waters. The apparent adsorption rate constants were calculated. Equilibrium studies showed that the data fit the Frumkin isotherm. The results show that in the adsorption process there are repulsive lateral interactions that depend mainly on the adsorbate molecules rather than the nature or distribution of the adsorption sites. Such lateral interactions seem to be established mainly between the isopropyl groups of adjacent molecules, being of the same order for the three molecules...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} ionic {{strength}} on the adsorption of alachlor, trifluralin, and <b>prometryn</b> on Amberlite XAD- 4 polymeric resin is studied. Static adsorption experiments {{are carried out}} at pH 3 - 6. 5 and ionic strength 0. 01 - 2 M at 20 °C. By increasing the ionic strength, the adsorption of herbicides can be significantly increased. The electrolyte addition affects both the effectiveness and efficiency of adsorption, leading eventually to a saturation of the resin surface. An explanation of the alteration of adsorption mechanisms, caused by ionic strength, is given, based mainly on the reduction in repulsive forces at the resin-herbicide interface and between adsorbing herbicide molecules, since both resin and herbicides have a polar ring {{as part of their}} structure. © 2006 Taylor & Francis...|$|E
40|$|Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) {{technique}} {{was applied for}} {{the investigation of the}} resin surface in pesticide adsorption. Static adsorption experiments were performed for the removal of alachlor, trifluralin, <b>prometryn</b> and amitrole from their aqueous solution on two polymeric resins (divinylbenzene - polystyrene copolymer XAD- 4 and polyacrylic ester XAD- 7). The obtained SEM images revealed the alteration of the surface morphology of the resin particles with regard to that of the untreated particles. Pesticides adsorption was determined from the reduction of the concentration of dissolved pesticides in aqueous solutions by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The results of SEM technique supported the phenomenon of pesticides adsorption, giving more information on the changes occurring at the resin surface. © by PSP. 2007...|$|E
40|$|A {{portable}} and time-integrating field sampler {{based on}} the supported liquid membrane (SLM) extraction technique was constructed. Using two programmable syringe pumps and one programmable valve, the sampler could carry out automatic unattended extraction for up to seven extracts, combining the steps of sampling, trace enrichment and clean-up. The sampler {{was applied to the}} extraction of four s-triazine herbicides (atrazine, cyanazine, <b>prometryn</b> and terbutryn) and six major degradation products of s-triazines, including three dealkylated products (deethyl deisopropyl atrazine (DDA), deisopropyl atrazine DIA and deethyl atrazine (DEA)) and three hydroxylated products (hydroxy atrazine (ATOH), hydroxy propazine (PROH) and hydroxy terbutylazine (TZOH)). The donor solution was obtained by mixing sample and buffer, consisting of 1 M phosphate buffer at pH 7. 0 and 1. 7 M NaCl, in the ratio of 19 : 1 (v/v). Extraction was performed by continuously pumping 10 mL portions of donor along the SLM until 3 L of sample had been extracted. The SLM consisted of di-n-hexylether and the acceptor was 1 M HCl. After extract collection, extracts were neutralised with NaOH and buffered with phosphate. Extracts were analysed with HPLC, using a gradient elution consisting of 3. 5 mM phosphate and acetonitrile and UV-detection at 220 nm. Enrichment factors in reagent water ranged from 1. 3 (for DIA) to 2739 (for terbutryn). The developed field sampler was tested by carrying out 24 -h time-weighted on-site extraction of the ten s-triazine target compounds in Hawassa Lake and its tributary river, located in the agricultural region of the Southern Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Atrazine, cyanazine and terbutryn were generally below the method detection limit, while <b>prometryn</b> was frequently found. Overall, s-triazines were not persistent in the studied environment and degradation products of s-triazines were found in higher concentrations than the parent herbicides in both the river and the lake...|$|E
