25|$|The GABA {{neurotransmitter}} mediates {{the fast}} synaptic inhibition {{in the central}} nervous system. When GABA is released from its pre-synaptic cell, it will bind to a receptor (most likely the GABAA receptor) that causes the post-synaptic cell to hyperpolarize (stay below its action <b>potential</b> <b>threshold).</b> This will counteract the effect of any excitatory manipulation from other neurotransmitter/receptor interactions.|$|E
25|$|The axon is a finer, cable-like {{projection}} {{that can}} extend tens, hundreds, or even {{tens of thousands}} of times the diameter of the soma in length. The axon carries nerve signals away from the soma (and also carries some types of information back to it). Many neurons have only one axon, but this axon may—and usually will—undergo extensive branching, enabling communication with many target cells. The part of the axon where it emerges from the soma is called the axon hillock. Besides being an anatomical structure, the axon hillock is also the part of the neuron that has the greatest density of voltage-dependent sodium channels. This makes it the most easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon: in electrophysiological terms, it has the most negative action <b>potential</b> <b>threshold.</b> While the axon and axon hillock are generally involved in information outflow, this region can also receive input from other neurons.|$|E
25|$|Some {{of these}} mutant {{channels}} have been expressed in {{dorsal root ganglion}} (DRG) or sympathetic neurons. In DRG neurons expressing the F1449V mutation, a lower threshold is required for action potential creation (93.1 ± 12.0 pA) than those expressing wild-type channels (124.1 ± 7.4 pA). Furthermore, while DRG neurons expressing wild-type channels only respond with a few action potentials, those expressing F1449V channels respond with a high-frequency train of action potentials. There is a similar effect in DRG neurons expressing the L858H and A863P mutants. Here, {{there is also a}} notable change in resting membrane potential, being depolarized by 4-7 mV versus wild-type channel expressing cells. The situation is different, however, in sympathetic neurons expressing the L858H mutation. While L858H expressing sympathetic ganglion are depolarized ~5mV relative to wild-type expressing neurons, their threshold for action potential initiation is notably higher. Furthermore, while current injection of 40pA for 950ms provokes an average of 6 action potentials in sympathetic neurons expressing wild-type channels this stimulation evokes only approximately 2 action potentials with reduced overshoots in sympathetic neurons expressing L858H mutant channels. Further investigation has demonstrated that the differences in response between DRG and sympathetic neurons is due to expression of NaV1.8 in the former. Consequently, expression of NaV1.8 channels in sympathetic neurons also expressing L858H mutant NaV1.7 results in neurons with a depolarized resting membrane potential that nevertheless have a normal action <b>potential</b> <b>threshold</b> and overshoot.|$|E

50|$|Hyperpolarization is {{a change}} in a cell's {{membrane}} potential that makes it more negative. It is the opposite of a depolarization. It inhibits action potentials by increasing the stimulus required to move the membrane potential to the action <b>potential</b> <b>threshold.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In general, a postsynaptic {{potential}} {{is dependent on}} the type and combination of receptor channel, reverse potential of the postsynaptic potential, action <b>potential</b> <b>threshold</b> voltage, ionic permeability of the ion channel, as well as the concentrations of the ions {{in and out of the}} cell; this determines if it is excitatory or inhibitory. IPSPs always want to keep the membrane potential more negative than the action <b>potential</b> <b>threshold</b> and can be seen as a [...] "transient hyperpolarization". [...] EPSPs and IPSPs compete with each other at numerous synapses of a neuron; this determines whether or not the action potential at the presynaptic terminal will regenerate at the postsynaptic membrane. Some common neurotransmitters involved in IPSPs are GABA and glycine.|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: In neural {{response}} telemetry (NRT), intracochlear electrodes stimulate the auditory nerve {{and record the}} {{neural response}}s. The electrical stimulation send to the auditory nerve by an electrode and the resulted response, called electrically {{evoked compound action potential}} (ECAP), is recorded by an adjacent electrode. The most important clinical applications of this test are evaluation and monitoring the intra and postoperative responses of auditory nerve and help to primary setting of speech processor. The aim of this study was evaluating of the <b>potential's</b> <b>threshold</b> changes in three monthes after receiving the devise in pediatric cochlear implant recipients. Materials and Methods: This longitudinal study evaluated the <b>potential's</b> <b>threshold</b> in four given electrodes in four sessions after receiving the device by approximately one months intervals in children implanted in Amir Alam and Hazrat-e-Rasoul hospitals in 2007, July to December. Results: ECAP mean threshold level of each electrode did not significantly change in differnent sessions, while there was significant difference between apical and basal electrodes’ responses in every session(p< 0. 001). Conclusion: The reliabiliy of the responses result in more certainty of clinician to fit the speech processor for a long time. Better responses in apical electrodes may lead to develope an effective coding strategy...|$|R
50|$|They soon {{discovered}} that at <b>threshold</b> <b>potential,</b> the inward and outward currents, of sodium and potassium ions respectively, were exactly equal and opposite. As opposed to the resting membrane <b>potential,</b> the <b>threshold</b> <b>potential's</b> conditions exhibited a balance of currents that were unstable. Instability refers {{to the fact that}} any further depolarization activates even more voltage-gated sodium channels, and the incoming sodium depolarizing current overcomes the delayed outward current of potassium. At resting level, on the other hand, the potassium and sodium currents are equal and opposite in a stable manner, where a sudden, continuous flow of ions should not result. The basis is that at a certain level of depolarization, when the currents are equal and opposite in an unstable manner, any further entry of positive charge generates an action potential. This specific value of depolarization (in mV) is otherwise known as the <b>threshold</b> <b>potential.</b>|$|R
50|$|Whether a postsynaptic {{potential}} is considered excitatory or inhibitory {{depends on the}} reversal potential for the ions of that current, and the threshold for a cell to fire an action potential (around -50mV). A postsynaptic potential with a reversal <b>potential</b> above <b>threshold,</b> such as a typical Na+ current, is considered excitatory. A potential with a reversal <b>potential</b> below <b>threshold,</b> such as a typical K+ or Cl− current, is considered inhibitory. Even if a current depolarizes a cell, it will inhibit the cell if its reversal <b>potential</b> is below <b>threshold.</b> This {{is due to the}} fact that multiple postsynaptic potentials do not have an added effect but average, so a current with a reversal potential above the resting <b>potential,</b> but below <b>threshold,</b> will not contribute to reaching threshold. Thus, neurotransmitters that act to open Na+ channels produce excitatory postsynaptic potentials, or EPSPs, whereas neurotransmitters that act to open K+ or Cl− channels produce inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, or IPSPs. When multiple types of channels are open within the same time period, their postsynaptic potentials summate (add) nonlinearly.|$|R
50|$|In neuroscience, the {{threshold}} potential {{is the critical}} level to which a membrane potential must be depolarized to initiate an action <b>potential.</b> <b>Threshold</b> potentials are necessary to regulate and propagate signaling in both {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).|$|E
50|$|ABE arises {{after the}} hyperpolarizing current is terminated: the {{potential}} across the cell rises rapidly with {{the absence of}} hyperpolarizing stimulus, but the action <b>potential</b> <b>threshold</b> stays at its lowered value. As a result, the potential is suprathreshold: sufficient to cause an action potential within the cell.|$|E

50|$|Once the {{membrane}} <b>potential</b> reaches <b>threshold,</b> an action <b>potential</b> occurs and causes a sharp spike in membrane polarity. There are five phases {{of an action}} potential: threshold, depolarization, peak, repolarization, and hyperpolarization.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the public}} atomic tests in 1998, Pakistan Government has adopted {{considerable}} recommendations and suggestions {{to think through}} its nuclear doctrine, and to integrate the nuclear power dimension into its defence strategy. The definition of <b>potential</b> <b>thresholds</b> has been refined, at least in public statements by Pakistani officials. According to one reliable source, the country adopted a three-point nuclear policy in early 2001 {{as part of the}} minimum credible deterrence. The most authoritative of these statements are provided by the officials of the Atomic Command Authority, in the form of four thresholds which were first mentioned by Khalid Kidwai in late 2001.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{important}} factor determining threshold electrotonus is membrane <b>potential,</b> so <b>threshold</b> electrotonus {{can also be used}} as an index of membrane potential. Furthermore, {{it can be used to}} identify characteristics of significant medical conditions through comparing the effects of those conditions on <b>threshold</b> <b>potential</b> with the effects viewed experimentally. For example, ischemia and depolarization cause the same [...] "fanning in" [...] effect of the electrotonus waveforms. This observation leads to the conclusion that ischemia may result from over-activation of potassium channels.|$|R
50|$|The GABA {{neurotransmitter}} mediates {{the fast}} synaptic inhibition {{in the central}} nervous system. When GABA is released from its pre-synaptic cell, it will bind to a receptor (most likely the GABAA receptor) that causes the post-synaptic cell to hyperpolarize (stay below its action <b>potential</b> <b>threshold).</b> This will counteract the effect of any excitatory manipulation from other neurotransmitter/receptor interactions.|$|E
50|$|A non-spiking neuron is a neuron that transmits {{a signal}} via graded potential. It will fire a signal {{regardless}} of any membrane <b>potential</b> <b>threshold.</b> Non-spiking neurons are primitive {{in the sense}} that they have no on or off switch, and are more sensitive to signal noise than spiking neurons with membrane potentials. Studies show that these neurons may offer a contribution to learning and modulation of motor neuron networks.|$|E
50|$|The IF and SR {{model of}} spike train occurs in Type I neurons, {{in which the}} spike rate or spike {{frequency}} of the occurrence increases smoothly {{with the increase in}} stimulus current starting from zero. Another phenomenon of spike train generation happens in Type II neurons, where firing occurs at the resting <b>potential</b> <b>threshold,</b> but with a quantum jump to a non-zero frequency. Models have been developed using the rate (frequency) of the spike train and are called rate-based models.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines are {{positive}} allosteric modulators of the GABA type A receptors (GABAA). The GABAA receptors are ligand-gated chloride-selective ion channels that are activated by GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Binding of benzodiazepines to this receptor complex promotes binding of GABA, {{which in turn}} increases the total conduction of chloride ions across the neuronal cell membrane. This increased chloride ion influx hyperpolarizes the neuron's membrane potential. As a result, the difference between resting <b>potential</b> and <b>threshold</b> <b>potential</b> is increased and firing is less likely.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} suggests {{the involvement of}} oxidative stress in noise-induced hearing loss. The present study analysed, in an animal experimental model, {{the time course of}} the pathogenic mechanisms of noise-induced cochlear damage and the efficacy of the antioxidant drug N-acetylcysteine in reducing noise ototoxicity. Animals were divided into two groups, exposed to noise one treated with N-acetylcysteine for 3 days and one (the control group) with saline. Acoustic trauma was induced by a continuous pure tone of 6 kHz, at 120 dB SPL for 30 minutes. Electrocochleographic recordings were made from an implanted round window electrode and the compound action potentials were measured daily at 2 - 16 kHz for 7 days. Morphological changes were analysed by scanning electron microscopy. The acoustic threshold measured 1 hour after acoustic trauma was elevated in the control group to 70 - 90 dB in the higher frequencies of the compound action potential audiogram, with a maximum threshold elevation ranging between 12 and 16 kHz. During the first 24 h, following acoustic trauma, there was a partial recovery of compound action <b>potential</b> <b>thresholds</b> of about 20 dB to reach a final threshold elevation of about 50 - 70 dB; there was no further improvement over the remaining experimental week. Animals treated with N-acetylcysteine showed a similar temporary threshold shift but a clear improvement in the recovery of compound action <b>potential</b> <b>thresholds,</b> with significantly reduced permanent threshold shift and hair cell loss. These data suggest that N-acetylcysteine is able to attenuate the toxic effect of acoustic trauma and could represent an interesting molecule for preventing inner ear injuries...|$|R
50|$|As various {{drugs and}} other factors act on the resting {{potential}} and bring it closer to the <b>threshold</b> <b>potential,</b> an action potential is more easily and rapidly obtained. Likewise, when the sodium channels {{are in a state}} of greater activation, then the influx of sodium ions that allows the membrane to reach <b>threshold</b> <b>potential</b> occurs more readily. In both instances, the excitability of the myocardium is increased.|$|R
50|$|Afferent nerve fibers {{responsible}} for sensory stimulus detection and feedback are especially sensitive to stimulation. This {{results from the}} specialized mechanoreceptor cells that are superimposed upon the afferent nerve fibers. Stretch-activated ion channels are located on these mechanoreceptor cells and serve to lower the action <b>potential</b> <b>threshold,</b> thus making the afferent nerves more sensitive to stimulation. Afferent nerve endings without mechanoreceptor cells are called free nerve endings. They are less sensitive than the encapsulated afferent fibers and generally function {{in the perception of}} pain.|$|E
50|$|The {{synaptic}} {{activity of}} individual neurons is modeled using equations {{to determine the}} temporal (and in some cases, spatial) summation of synaptic signals, membrane <b>potential,</b> <b>threshold</b> for action potential generation, the absolute and relative refractory period, and optionally ion receptor channel kinetics and Gaussian noise (to increase biological accuracy by incorporation of random elements). In addition to connectivity, some types of artificial neural networks, such as spiking neural networks, also model the distance between neurons, {{and its effect on}} the synaptic weight (the strength of a synaptic transmission).|$|E
50|$|Clonus {{tends to}} co-exist with {{spasticity}} {{in many cases}} of stroke and spinal cord injury likely due to their common physiological origins. Some consider clonus as simply an extended outcome of spasticity. Although closely linked, clonus is not seen in all patients with spasticity. Clonus tends to not be present with spasticity in patients with significantly increased muscle tone, as the muscles are constantly active and therefore not engaging in the characteristic on/off cycle of clonus. Clonus results due to an increased motor neuron excitation (decreased action <b>potential</b> <b>threshold)</b> and is common in muscles with long conduction delays, such as the long reflex tracts found in distal muscle groups. Clonus is commonly seen in the ankle but may exist in other distal structures as well.|$|E
50|$|The {{firing of}} the {{pacemaker}} cells is induced electrically by reaching the <b>threshold</b> <b>potential</b> {{of the cell}} membrane. The <b>threshold</b> <b>potential</b> is the potential an excitable cell membrane, such as a myocyte, must reach in order to induce an action potential. This depolarization is caused by very small net inward currents of calcium ions across the cell membrane, which {{gives rise to the}} action potential.|$|R
50|$|Suxamethonium has {{a longer}} {{duration}} of effect than acetylcholine, {{and is not}} hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase.

40|$|The {{nucleus accumbens}} is a {{forebrain}} region that mediates cocaine self-administration and withdrawal effects in animal models of cocaine dependence. Considerable evidence suggests {{an important role}} of dopamine D 1 receptors in these effects. Using a combination of current-clamp recordings in brain slices and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from freshly dissociated neurons, we found that nucleus accumbens neurons are less excitable in cocaine withdrawn rats because of a novel form of plasticity: reduced whole-cell sodium currents. Three days after discontinuation of repeated cocaine injections, nucleus accumbens neurons recorded in brain slices were less responsive to depolarizing current injections, had higher action <b>potential</b> <b>thresholds,</b> and had lower spike amplitudes. Freshly dissociated nucleus accumbens neurons from cocainepretreated rats exhibited diminished sodium current densit...|$|R
50|$|In {{clinical}} and experimental studies {{there is an}} observed increase in muscle excitability in electrical currents involving chemical actions, {{while there is a}} decrease in excitability to current associated with electrical induction in denervated muscles. Changes in the resting membrane potential involving denervated muscles presents mild depolarization when a muscle contraction stimulus is present. While there is no immediate change involving resting and action potential, there is an increase with membrane resistance. After prolonged denervation, it is revealed that resting membrane potential over time is reduced while action potentials progressively decreased and become slower. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that becomes supersensitive in the presence of denervated muscle. Upon injection of acetylcholine, a slower contractile response, which is drastically under action <b>potential</b> <b>threshold,</b> is elicited.|$|E
50|$|In humans, {{the effect}} of VaTxs has not been {{systematically}} studied. In general, the venom of P. cambridgei is known to produce pain, but the amount of toxin that is present in a bite is too low to cause serious health problems. The effects of VaTxs on TRPV1 and Kv2 have been studied by injecting VaTxs subcutaneously in mice. VaTxs bind to the extracellular pore domain of TRPV1 in the peripheral nervous system causing {{the opening of the}} pore and cation influx, therefore triggering the activation of the pain system. Despite the similar architecture of TRPV1 and Kv2, VaTx1 and VaTx2 bind to the voltage-sensing domain of Kv2 rather than the pore-domain. By doing so, they increase the action <b>potential</b> <b>threshold</b> in the neuromuscular junction, eliciting paralytic behavior.|$|E

30|$|In summary, dyscarbia {{especially}} hypocapnia {{should be}} {{associated with an increased}} harm after CA leading to increased unfavorable outcome or in-hospital mortality. Conversely O 2 seems a two halves phenomenon with: (1) a former deleterious effect of hypoxia during resuscitation efforts, the potential benefit of hyperoxia implying more evaluations; (2) followed by a deleterious effect of both hypoxia and hyperoxia after ROSC in the post-CA phase. To date because O 2 and CO 2 derangements have no obvious benefit, aiming at normoxia and normocapnia after CA are potentially two very easy targets to achieve in post-resuscitation care bundles. Meanwhile all studies describing ABG parameters in TTM- or TH-treated CA patients should actually emphasize the strategy used, either a temperature-corrected or a non-corrected strategy to more precisely evaluate <b>potential</b> <b>thresholds.</b>|$|R

Both in vivo and in vitro, the disappearance of all PAHs {{was found to be}} very strongly correlated with ionization potential. This was true even for compounds beyond the ionization <b>potential</b> <b>thresholds</b> of lignin peroxidase and Mn 3 +. Deviations from this correlation were seen in the cases of PAHs which are susceptible to radical addition reactions.
