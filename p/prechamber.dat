5000|$|Direct-injected small {{diesel engines}} still were not {{practical}} [...] and the <b>prechambered</b> indirect injection engine was invented, {{along with the}} requirement of glowplugs {{to be used for}} starting.

5000|$|Faced {{with these}} constraints, GAZ {{continued}} to modify and alter (read simplify) the make-up of the car. One such {{result was the}} ZMZ-4022 motor with a stratified charge or in original terms—"prechambered—torch ignition". Similar to Honda CVCC design, GAZ experimented with such technology in the early 1950s, and its patent dates to 1968. Now that it had time to spare, {{it was decided to}} introduce this novelty. To keep production costs low, the new engine retained all of ZMZ-24Ds key features: 4 cylinders, OHV, displacement etc. However the material of both cylinder block and head was now aluminium. The big novelty was four additional inlet valves that charged the combustion <b>prechambers.</b> Feeding this was a three barrel carburettor, where the draft from third barrel was directed into the four <b>prechambers.</b> The spark plugs were located inside these chambers, and lean fuel-air mixture in main cylinders was ignited by conical jets (the [...] "torches") from these <b>prechambers.</b> Compared to the ZMZ-24D, power rose by 10 hp to 105 at 4750 rpm. Though the car was 50 kg heavier in weight, it could now do 0-100 km/h acceleration in 16.2 seconds (compared to the 22 on the GAZ-24) and the top speed also rose from 145 to 152 km/h. Whilst not exactly impressive dynamics {{by the turn of the}} decade, its fuel economy figures were: from 10.5 litres per 100 km on the GAZ-24 to 8.5.|$|R

In {{this case the}} general rule does not apply because Diesels with compression ratios over 20:1 are indirect injection diesels.

Known as [...] "F8M", the new engine {{was designed by}} engineer George Douin and his team and broke with tradition by featuring no removable cylinder liners, thanks to advances in metals technology that significantly slow the wear of rubbing mechanical parts. The new 4- cylinder unit adopted an overhead camshaft driven by a toothed belt that also controls the diesel injection pump. A second belt rotates the alternator and water pump, while a vacuum pump located at the rear operates the brake servo. The cast iron block is topped by a light alloy cylinder head featuring Ricardo Comet <b>prechambers.</b> The engine is mounted transversely inclined rearwards 12°.

This report describes the results from the two field evaluations. The CDPF-DOC was installed on a load-haul-dump (LHD) powered by a 175 -kW, <b>prechambered,</b> turbocharged engine. This system reduced diesel particulate matter (DPM) concentrations by 712128 pet, as determined by size-selective sampling with gravimetric analysis, and by 712129 pet, as determined by respirable combustible dust (RCD) analysis at the vehicle operator's location.

The CDPF reduced DPM concentrations by 722121 pet, as determined by size-selective sampling with gravimetric analysis, and by 622125 pet, as determined by RCD analysis at the vehicle operator's location. Underground evaluation was more difficult because of frequent movement by the roof-bolting jumbo, variation in daily workload, tremendous fluctuation in ventilation airflow rates, and use of a high sulfur diesel fuel, which promotes the formation of sulfate particles, decreases filtration efficiency, and hastens the deterioration of the catalyst...|$|R

Engines {{of the type}} 4F 145 BE are used, they are water-cooled inline four cylinder four stroke diesel engines with <b>prechamber</b> injection and five litres of displacement. The rated power is 29,4 kW. This engine is started using a crank and petrol, it is switched to diesel fuel afterwards. The torque is transmitted to the mechanical five speed gearbox with a single disc dry clutch; only the rear wheels are driven. They are equipped with drum brakes, the handbrake is a gear box brake. For power take-off, the RS01 has a PTO which depends on the clutch. A belt pulley was also available for the RS01. Starting in 1953, the <b>prechamber</b> engine was replaced with a turbulence chamber engine, which is started using compressed air.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{different}} glow plug types: the in-cylinder variety and the in-manifold ("Thermostart") variety. In the case of in-cylinder, there is a plug in every cylinder direct injected (or {{in the case of}} indirect injected, the glow plug is in the <b>prechamber</b> providing a hot spot to encourage ignition. In the case of the in-manifold one, there is only one for all the cylinders.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the divided {{combustion}} chamber is {{to speed up the}} combustion process, in order to increase the power output by increasing engine speed. The addition of a <b>prechamber,</b> however, increases heat loss to the cooling system and thereby lowers engine efficiency. The engine requires glow plugs for starting. In an indirect injection system the air moves fast, mixing the fuel and air. This simplifies injector design and allows the use of smaller engines and less tightly toleranced designs which are simpler to manufacture and more reliable. Direct injection, by contrast, uses slow-moving air and fast-moving fuel; both the design and manufacture of the injectors is more difficult. The optimisation of the in-cylinder air flow is much more difficult than designing a <b>prechamber.</b> There is much more integration between the design of the injector and the engine. It {{is for this reason that}} car diesel engines were almost all indirect injection until the ready availability of powerful CFD simulation systems made the adoption of direct injection practical.|$|E

50|$|This chamber {{is located}} at the {{cylinder}} head and is connected to the engine cylinder by small holes. It occupies 40% of the total cylinder volume. During the compression stroke, air from the main cylinder enters the precombustion chamber. At this moment, fuel is injected into the precombustion chamber and combustion begins. Pressure increases and the fuel droplets are forced through the small holes into the main cylinder, resulting in a very good mix of the fuel and air. The bulk of the combustion actually takes place in the main cylinder. This type of combustion chamber has multi-fuel capability because the temperature of the <b>prechamber</b> vaporizes the fuel before the main combustion event occurs.|$|E

Near {{the top of the}} compression stroke fuel is atomized at high pressure into a hemispherical Inconel <b>prechamber</b> in the cylinder heads using Bosch pintle and seat mechanical fuel injectors. This is called Indirect injection. GM used fully mechanical DB2 series injection pumps on all military HMMWVs and 1982-1993 6.2's and 6.5's.

[...] The first mention of Honda developed CVCC technology {{was done by}} Mr. Soichiro Honda February 12, 1971, at the Federation of Economic Organizations Hall in Otemachi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo. Honda's engineers at the time, Mr. Date conferred with Mr. Yagi and Mr. Nakagawa {{about the possibility of}} creating lean combustion via a <b>prechamber,</b> which some diesel engines utilized. The first engine to be installed with the CVCC approach for testing was the single-cylinder, 300 cc Honda EA engine used in the Honda N600 hatchback in January 1970. This technology allowed Honda's cars to meet Japanese and United States emission standards in the 1970s without a catalytic converter. A type of stratified charge engine, it first appeared on the 1975 ED1 engine. As emission laws advanced and required more stringent admissible levels, Honda abandoned the CVCC method and introduced PGM-FI, or Programmed Fuel Injection on all Honda vehicles. Some vehicles in Japan had a combination of electronically controlled carburetors, called PGM-Carb on specific, transitional Honda D, E and ZC engines.|$|E

The influence of the <b>prechamber</b> geometrical configuration was evaluted through variations of the nozzle orifice diameter, number and orientation, as well as <b>prechamber</b> volume and internal shape.

Previous research indicates that the <b>prechamber</b> is responsible for engine out emission. In this project, four concepts of <b>prechamber</b> designs are developed with objective to improve the engines efficiency. The design variable is the volume of the <b>prechamber.</b> Solidworks 2010 software was used for designing process while Ansys 12. 1 software was used to perform the simulation of the engine with <b>prechamber.</b> The results of maximum in cylinder pressure and temperature from the simulation are used to determine the best <b>prechamber</b> model.

Then, variations of the selected <b>prechamber</b> configuration parameters, {{as well as of the}} piston geometry, of the turbocharger characteristics and of the engine operating parameters, were carried out in order to determine their influence on the engine performance and emissions. Through the generation of gas jets in the main chamber, the use of a <b>prechamber</b> strongly intensifies and accelerates the combustion process. However, this advantage is conditioned by a significant delay of the spark timing in order to generate substantial gas jets. This results in a large decrease in peak cylinder pressure and in an important reduction of NOx, CO and THC emissions. Minimum emissions are achieved at a spark timing of about 8 °CABTDC. The <b>prechamber</b> geometrical parametric study indicates that trends which increase the penetration of the gas jets and/or promote an early arrival of the flame front at the piston top land crevice entrance are beneficial to reduce the CO and THC emissions. In comparison with the direct ignition, the <b>prechamber</b> ignition yields approximately 40 % and 55 % less CO and THC emissions, respectively. However, this also leads to about 2 %-point lower fuel conversion efficiency. The optimisation of the turbocharger results in a recovery of about 1 %-point in fuel conversion efficiency, but a consequent change in the exhaust manifold gas dynamics causes an increase in THC emissions.
