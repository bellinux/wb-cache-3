500|$|A naive (or inexperienced) B cell is {{one which}} {{belongs to a}} clone which has never {{encountered}} the epitope {{to which it is}} specific. In contrast, a memory B cell is one which derives from an activated naive or memory [...] B cell. The activation of a naive or a memory B cell is followed by a manifold proliferation of that particular B cell, most of the progeny of which terminally differentiate into plasma B cells; the rest survive as memory B cells. So, when the naive cells belonging to a particular clone encounter their specific antigen to give rise to the plasma cells, and also leave a few memory cells, this is known as the <b>primary</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response.</b> In the course of proliferation of this clone, the B cell receptor genes can undergo [...] frequent (one in every two cell divisions) mutations in the genes coding for paratopes of antibodies. These frequent mutations are termed somatic hypermutation. Each such mutation alters the epitope-binding ability of the paratope slightly, creating new clones of B cells in the process. Some of the newly created paratopes bind more strongly to the same epitope (leading to the selection of the clones possessing them), which is known as affinity maturation. Other paratopes bind better to epitopes that are slightly different from the original epitope that had stimulated proliferation. Variations in the epitope structure are also usually produced by mutations in the genes of pathogen coding for their antigen. Somatic hypermutation, thus, makes the B cell receptors and the soluble antibodies in subsequent encounters with antigens, more inclusive in their antigen recognition potential of altered epitopes, apart from bestowing greater specificity for the antigen that induced proliferation in the first place. When the memory cells get stimulated by the antigen to produce plasma cells (just like in the clone's primary response), and leave even more memory cells in the process, this is known as a secondary immune response, which translates into greater numbers of plasma cells and faster rate of antibody production lasting for longer periods. The memory B cells produced as a part of secondary response recognize the corresponding antigen faster and bind more strongly with it (i.e., greater affinity of binding) owing to affinity maturation. The soluble antibodies produced by the clone show a similar enhancement in antigen binding.|$|E

40|$|The progeny of T {{lymphocytes}} {{responding to}} immunization mostly die rapidly, leaving a few long-lived survivors functioning as immune memory. Thus, {{control of this}} choice of death versus survival is critical for immune memory. There are indications that reactive radicals {{may be involved in}} this death pathway. We now show that, in mice lacking inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), higher frequencies of both CD 4 and CD 8 memory T cells persist in response to immunization, even when iNOS+/+ APCs are used for immunization. Postactivation T cell death by neglect is reduced in iNOS–/– T cells, and levels of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl- 2 and Bcl-xL are increased. Inhibitors of the iNOS-peroxynitrite pathway also enhance memory responses and block postactivation death by neglect in both mouse and human T cells. However, early <b>primary</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> are not enhanced, which suggests that altered survival, rather than enhanced activation, is responsible for the persistent immunity observed. Thus, in <b>primary</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses,</b> iNOS in activated T cells autocrinely controls their susceptibility to death by neglect to determine the level of persisting CD 4 and CD 8 T cell memory, and modulation of this pathway can enhance the persistence of <b>immune</b> memory in <b>response</b> to vaccination...|$|R

For members of the Paramyxovirinae subfamily, very young infants are the main target group for immunization.

5000|$|Immune {{response}} is the immunological response originating from immune system activation by antigens, including immunity to pathogenic microorganisms and its products, {{as well as}} autoimmunity to self-antigens allergies, and graft ejections. In this process main cells involved are the T cells, B cells of lymphocytes, and macrophagea. These cells produce lymphokines that influence the other host cells activities. B cells mature to produce immunoglobulins or antibodies, that react with antigens. At the same time, macrophages are processing the antigens into immunogenic units which stimulate B lymphocites to differentiation into antibody secreting plasma cells, stimulating the T cells to realise lymphokines.

5000|$|The {{classification}} of dendritic cells as {{another type of}} white blood cell occurred over thirty-five years ago by Ralph Steinmann and Zanvil A.

[...] Dendritic cells line airways and intestines, participate in a rich network making up part of the epidermal layer of the skin, and play a unique role in initiating a <b>primary</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response.</b> Dendritic cells are named after their structure that resembles that of a dendrite of an axon, and they have two vital functions: display antigens, which are recognized by T cells and alert lymphocytes {{of the presence of}} an injury or infection. When the body is introduced to infection or injury, dendritic cells migrate to immune or lymphoid tissues. These two types of tissues are rich in T cells, the cells whose actions are induced by dendritic cells. Dendritic cells will capture antigens and engulf them through the process of phagocytosis. Dendritic cells contain Toll-like receptors (TLR) that will recognize a broad variety of microorganisms in the case of invasion. [...] The activation of these receptors stimulates specific antigen responses and development of antigen-specific adaptive immunity. A unique feature of dendritic cells is that they are able to open up the tight junctions between epithelial cells and sample invaders themselves, all while maintaining the integrity of the epithelial barrier with expression of their own tight-junction proteins. A real life example of dendritic cell functions is displayed in the rejection of organ transplants.|$|E

To promote such responses, dendritic cells must be activated by exogenous agonists, such as LPS, or by products of activated leukocytes, such as TNF-α and IL- 1. How dendritic cells might be activated in the absence of exogenous stimuli, or without the immediate presence of activated leukocytes, as might occur in immunity to tumor cells or transplants, is unknown. We postulated that heparan sulfate, an acidic, biologically active polysaccharide associated with cell membranes and extracellular matrices, which is rapidly released under conditions of inflammation and tissue damage, might provide such a stimulus. Incubation of immature murine dendritic cells with heparan sulfate induced phenotypic maturation evidenced by up-regulation of I-A, CD 40, CD 54 (ICAM- 1), CD 80 (B 7 - 1), and CD 86 (B 7 - 2). Dendritic cells exposed to heparan sulfate exhibited a markedly lowered rate of Ag uptake and increased allostimulatory capacity. Stimulation of dendritic cells with heparan sulfate induced release of TNF-α, IL- 1 β, and IL- 6, although the maturation of dendritic cells was independent of these cytokines. These results suggest that soluble heparan sulfate chains, as products of the degradation of heparan sulfate proteoglycan, might induce maturation of dendritic cells without exogenous stimuli, thus contributing to the generation and maintenance of <b>primary</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses...</b>|$|R
