Frequency combs can be generated by a number of mechanisms, including periodic modulation (in amplitude and/or phase) of a continuous-wave laser, four-wave mixing in nonlinear media or stabilization of the <b>pulse</b> <b>train</b> generated by a mode-locked laser. Much work has been devoted to the latter mechanism, which was developed {{around the turn of the}} 21st century and ultimately led to one half of the Nobel Prize in Physics being shared by John L.

The effect of jitter was studied using a physiologically-based model of auditory nerve and brainstem (medial superior olive neurons).

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of two stimulation parameters on perceived discomfort and torque increment size and variability. Discomfort was evaluated using a visual analog scale (0 - 100 mm) for pain. The rectus femoris muscle of the dominant leg of 24 young healthy men was stimulated during submaximal (80 % maximal) voluntary contractions. The size and variability of torque increments and perceived discomfort were assessed following stimulation with: (1) <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> (100 HZ, 150 V, 0. 2 -ms pulse duration) of different lengths (50 ms and 100 ms); and (2) <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> (100 HZ, 100 ms, 150 V) with different pulse durations (0. 2 ms and 0. 1 ms). <b>Pulse</b> <b>trains</b> of 100 ms generated larger torque increments and produced less variability, but caused more discomfort than <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> of 50 ms. Average discomfort ratings for <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> of 100 ms were 43. 1 mm, and of 50 ms were 53. 2 mm. There was no difference in torque increment size or in variability between <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> with <b>pulse</b> durations of 0. 1 ms and 0. 2 ms, whereas discomfort was less for the shorter pulse durations; average discomfort ratings were 53. 1 mm and 58. 1 mm for pulse durations of 0. 1 ms and 0. 2 ms, respectively.
