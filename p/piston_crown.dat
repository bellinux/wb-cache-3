2500|$|The {{camshaft}} [...] "lift" [...] is {{the resultant}} net {{rise of the}} valve from its seat. [...] The farther the valve rises from its seat the more airflow can be provided, which is generally more beneficial. [...] Greater lift has some limitations. [...] Firstly, lift {{is limited by the}} increased proximity of the valve head to the <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> and secondly, greater effort is required to move the valve springs to a higher state of compression. Increased lift can also be limited by lobe clearance in the cylinder head casting. Higher valve lift can have the same effect as increased duration where valve overlap is less desirable.|$|E

50|$|These engines {{all used}} a {{two-stroke}} cycle with twelve pistons sharing six cylinders, <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> to <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> in an opposed piston configuration. This unusual configuration required two crankshafts, {{one at the}} bottom of the cylinder block and the other at the top, geared together. The pistons moved towards each other during the operating cycle. Intake and exhaust manifolds were duplicated on both sides of the block. There were two cam-operated injection pumps per cylinder, each feeding two nozzles, for 4 nozzles per cylinder in all.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of sodium in {{a ratio of}} 1:3 gives the lowest melting point and must be avoided. This melting point of 535 °C can cause problems on the hot spots of the engine like <b>piston</b> <b>crowns,</b> valve seats, and turbochargers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shape of}} the {{combustion}} chamber as an [...] "inverted hemi-head", along with the angled cylinder head joint and pitched-roof <b>piston</b> <b>crowns,</b> had earlier {{been used in the}} 1930 Van Ranst-designed Packard V12 engine, although in this case the valves were both in the block as side valves and the spark plug was poorly placed at the extremity of the combustion chamber.|$|R
50|$|The 2.8 {{gained a}} bad {{reputation}} early in its career due to a tendency for excessive carbon deposits to accumulate on the <b>piston</b> <b>crowns</b> during low-speed running, which would burn through the crowns when run at higher revs. This was later cured by a switch to stronger pistons but the engine was also a mediocre performer offering no real economy benefit and it was dropped in 1973, {{to be replaced by}} the ‘new’ 3.4.|$|R
50|$|With Schnuerle porting, the <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> {{may be of}} any shape, even bowl shaped. This {{permits a}} far better {{combustion}} chamber shape and flame path, giving better combustion, particularly at high speeds.|$|E
50|$|The <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> {{was usually}} shaped with a raised rib as a {{deflector}} piston, {{so that the}} fresh charge was intended to move upwards into a vertical loop, then downwards with the exhaust gas.|$|E
50|$|The WHE-25 design used a reed valve, {{which is}} a piece of thin metal {{covering}} the top of the piston (as shown in the figure). The WHE-DR design replaced the reed with a ball resting in a valve seat in the <b>piston</b> <b>crown.</b>|$|E
50|$|A new-generation straight-6 F-head (overhead inlet, {{side exhaust}} valve) it {{differed}} from its predecessor by having redesigned big end and main bearings using an improved alloy, improved tappets {{and a more}} efficient drive to the timing gear. <b>Piston</b> <b>crowns</b> were raised and rectangular combustion chambers provided. Externally an oil filter was mounted on the forward right hand side. Without a beam axle the engine could be mounted further forward and particular care was taken to mount it so as to minimise noise and vibration to the passengers.|$|R
5000|$|The later 16-valve engines {{were part}} of FIAT's [...] "Pratola Serra" [...] (B family) modular engine series, and had a heavier {{cast-iron}} block engine, with an alloy head, and the camshafts were belt driven. The Twin Spark name {{comes from the fact}} that there are two spark plugs per cylinder. It was cast iron for its higher beam strength, less complexity and hence lower production costs. When new, these engines were notable for their high efficiency as demonstrated by the BMEP (brake mean effective pressures) exerted upon the <b>piston</b> <b>crowns.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first P6 used a 2.0 L (...) engine {{designed}} specifically for the P6. Although it was announced {{towards the end of}} 1963, the car had been in [...] "pilot production" [...] {{since the beginning of the}} year, therefore deliveries were able to begin immediately. Original output was in the order of [...] At the time the engine was unusual in having an overhead camshaft layout. The cylinder head had a perfectly flat surface, and the combustion chambers were cast into the <b>piston</b> <b>crowns</b> (sometimes known as a Heron head).|$|R
50|$|This article {{refers to}} the two-valve Gnome rotary engine (automatic inlet valve in the <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> and pushrod {{operated}} exhaust valve). For the 100 hp Monosoupape engine go to Gnome Monosoupape 9 Type B-2, (Monosoupape engines had a single pushrod operated exhaust valve and inlet ports exposed by the piston near bottom dead centre).|$|E
5000|$|However, {{too high}} a value can lead to ash {{formation}} if the oil gets past the cylinder rings and onto the <b>piston</b> <b>crown,</b> as the metal based additives are left behind don't burn. This hence can cause pre-ignition and the particulate matter entering the exhaust system (causing polution and catalyst damage) - hence the rising popularity of low ash (low SAPs oils) as part of ACEA oil claims.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an engine}} {{designed}} {{to use the}} squish effect, at top dead centre (TDC) the <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> comes very close, (typically less than 1 mm), to the cylinder head. The gases are suddenly [...] "squished" [...] out within the combustion chamber, creating turbulence which promotes thorough fuel/air mixing, a factor beneficial to efficient combustion. Squish effect {{may be found in}} ohv and ohc engines, including engines with a Heron cylinder head.|$|E
5000|$|Version one {{was based}} on Ford's 2.3-liter Pinto engine and weighed 152 lb (vs. 415 lb for its cast iron counterpart). It was {{designed}} to produce [...] at 9200 rpm. It was composed of metal cylinder sleeves, metal combustion chamber tops, metal <b>piston</b> <b>crowns,</b> bearings, valves and seats, and a stock 2.3L Pinto crankshaft. Nearly {{everything else in the}} engine, including the block, rods and piston skirts, were made of glass reinforced Polyamide-imide thermoplastic resins manufactured at the time by Amoco Chemicals Co. The engine was never installed in a vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Bristol Siddeley also {{manufactured}} {{diesel engines}} under licence from the German company Maybach. These were for installation in British Rail Class 42 and Class 52 locomotives which were themselves based on licensed German designs but {{with as much}} British-built content as possible. The Maybach MD650, MD655 and MD870 engines built by Bristol Siddeley were sophisticated in design, running at much higher speeds than normal diesels of their size and featured advanced construction such as a disc-webbed crankshaft that ran in large roller bearings, telescopic pipes to deliver cooling oil to the pistons and detachable <b>piston</b> <b>crowns.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The engine airbox covers (the upper covers {{observed}} {{on the side}} of an EMD engine - they cover the [...] "airbox" [...] that allows air to flow through the cylinder block to the power assemblies) are removed to allow visual inspection of the inside of the cylinder liners and the <b>piston</b> <b>crowns,</b> skirts and rings. The crankcase access covers (the lower covers {{observed on}} the side of an EMD engine) are also removed to inspect for coolant leakage, damaged components and excessive wear. A proper inspection requires filling and pressurizing the cooling system to check for leakage from the power assemblies.|$|R
50|$|CI {{engines that}} use a blower {{typically}} use uniflow scavenging. In this design the cylinder wall contains several intake ports placed uniformly spaced along the circumference {{just above the}} position that the <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> reaches when at BDC. An exhaust valve or several like that of 4-stroke engines is used. The final part of the intake manifold is an air sleeve which feeds the intake ports. The intake ports are placed at an horizontal angle to the cylinder wall (I.e: they are in plane of the <b>piston</b> <b>crown)</b> to give a swirl to the incoming charge to improve combustion. The largest reciprocating IC are low speed CI engines of this type; they are used for marine propulsion (see marine diesel engine) or electric power generation and achieve the highest thermal efficiencies among internal combustion engines of any kind. Some Diesel-electric locomotive engines operate on the 2-stroke cycle. The most powerful of them have a brake power of around 4.5 MW or 6,000 HP. The EMD SD90MAC class of locomotives use a 2-stroke engine. The comparable class GE AC6000CW whose prime mover has almost the same brake power uses a 4-stroke engine.|$|E
50|$|Much effort, {{and many}} {{different}} designs of <b>piston</b> <b>crown,</b> went into developing improved scavenging. The crowns developed {{from a simple}} rib to a large asymmetric bulge, usually with a steep face on the inlet side and a gentle curve on the exhaust. Despite this, cross scavenging was never as effective as hoped. Most engines today use Schnuerle porting instead. This places a pair of transfer ports in {{the sides of the}} cylinder and encourages gas flow to rotate around a vertical axis, rather than a horizontal axis.|$|E
50|$|In 1926, the German {{engineer}} Adolf Schnürle {{developed the}} system of ports that bears his name. The ports were relocated to both {{be on the same}} side of the cylinder, with the transfer port being split into two angled ports, one on either side of the exhaust port. A deflector piston was no longer required. The gas flow was now a circular loop, flowing in and across the <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> from the transfer ports, up and around the combustion chamber and then out through the exhaust port.|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} the {{modeling and simulation}} of the crank-piston model of internal combustion engine. The object of the research was the engine of the vehicle from the B segment. The individual elements of the gasoline engine were digitizing using the process of reverse engineering. After converting the geometry, assembling was imported to MSC Adams software. The crank-piston system was specified by boundary conditions of piston forces applied on the <b>pistons</b> <b>crowns.</b> This force was obtain from the cylinder pressure recorded during the tests, that were carried out on a chassis dynamometer. The simulation studies allowed t determine the load distribution in a dynamic state for the selected kinematic pairs...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} NASA-Lewis {{program of}} coating development for aircraft gas turbine blades and vanes is presented. Improved ceramic layer compositions are investigated, along the MCrAlY bond films {{and the methods}} of uniform deposition of the coatings; the thermomechanical and fuel impurity tolerance limits of the coatings are being studied. Materials include the ZrO 2 -Y 2 O 3 /NiCrAlY system; {{the effects of the}} bond coat and zirconia composition on coating life and Mach 1 burner rig test results are discussed. It is concluded that Diesel engines can also utilize thermal barrier coatings; they have been used successfully on <b>piston</b> <b>crowns</b> and exhaust valves of shipboard engines to combat lower grade fuel combustion corrosion...|$|R
50|$|This {{direct-drive}} aero-engine {{is unusual}} in two respects: it is very oversquare with a bore:stroke ratio of 1.295:1, {{and it has a}} side-valve valvetrain. The designer determined that since maximum continuous power output (65.3kW) was to be developed at only 2800 rpm, the extra weight and complexity of overhead valves would be superfluous. The resulting engine is compact and lightweight, with a dry weight of 58 kg, and a maximum power-to-weight ratio of 1.09 kW/kg (wet; coolant fluids weigh 5 kg).The engine uses fuel injection, so carburetor heat is unnecessary. Lubrication is by dry sump, with an external oil tank. Dual ignition is used, each cylinder having twin spark plugs sited between the valves and the <b>piston</b> <b>crowns.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{air cell}} {{is a small}} {{cylindrical}} chamber {{with a hole in}} one end. It is mounted more or less coaxially with the injector, said axis being parallel to the <b>piston</b> <b>crown,</b> with the injector firing across a small cavity which is open to the cylinder into the hole in the end of the air cell. The air cell is mounted so as to minimise thermal contact with the mass of the head. A pintle injector with a narrow spray pattern is used. At TDC the majority of the charge mass is contained in the cavity and air cell.|$|E
50|$|The engine has {{a single}} {{overhead}} camshaft (SOHC), driven by a chain. The vertical hanging valves are arranged in two rows, operated by rocker levers. As with the M115, inlet and outlet both {{are on the right}} side of the engine. Within the cylinder head there is (on the left side of the engine) a recessed combustion chamber (with a flat <b>piston</b> <b>crown),</b> in which the exhaust valve and the spark plug are located while the remaining area (on the right side) forms a squish area that is intended to swirl the fuel-air-mixture in the combustion chamber.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{the heat}} and {{pressure}} of combustion is applied to one specific point on the piston as it exits the precombustion chamber or swirl chamber, such engines are less suited to high specific power outputs (such as turbocharging or tuning) than direct injection diesels. The increased temperature and pressure on {{one part of the}} <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> causes uneven expansion which can lead to cracking, distortion or other damage due to improper use; use of [...] " [...] starting fluid" [...] (ether) is not recommended in glow plug, indirect injection systems, because explosive knock can occur, causing engine damage.|$|E
50|$|Koreyvo, Jumo and Napier Deltic engines {{used one}} piston per {{cylinder}} to expose an intake port, {{and the other}} to expose an exhaust port. Each piston is referred to as either an intake piston or an exhaust piston depending on its function in this regard. This layout gives superior scavenging, as gas flow through the cylinder is axial rather than radial, and simplifies design of the <b>piston</b> <b>crowns.</b> In the Jumo 205 and its variants, the upper crankshaft serves the exhaust pistons, and the lower crankshaft the intake pistons. In designs using multiple cylinder banks, such as the Junkers Jumo 223 and the Deltic, each big end bearing serves one inlet and one exhaust piston, using a forked connecting rod for the exhaust piston.|$|R
5000|$|Cams {{that have}} {{excessive}} valve lift, running at high rpm, can cause {{what is called}} [...] "valve float", where the valve spring tension is insufficient to keep the valve following the cam at its apex. This {{could also be a}} result of a very steep rise of the lobe, where the valve is effectively shot off the end of the cam rather than following the cams’ profile. This is typically what happens when a motor over revs. This is where the engine rpm exceeds the maximum design rpm. The valve train is typically the limiting factor in determining the maximum rpm the engine can maintain either for a prolonged period or temporarily. Sometimes an over rev can cause engine failure when the valves become bent as a result of colliding with the <b>piston</b> <b>crowns.</b>|$|R
40|$|The fuel {{injection}} period {{plays an important}} role in determining the combustion efficiency of internal combustion engine, especially in the direct injection system. In this paper, the numerical calculation to analyse the injection process for two different <b>piston</b> <b>crowns</b> in a compressed natural gas direct injection engine (CNG-DI) engine was carried out. The investigations were performed in a single cylinder of 1. 6 litre of a CNG engine running at wide open throttle. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code was employed to simulate the {{fuel injection}} event under transient condition by the use of moving meshes and boundaries. The numerical simulation results were presented according to the certain degree of crank angle during the fuel injection covering the flow structure and its contour field. The predicted spray formation was compared to the spray image from the experimental data and shows a good agreement in the contour of its spray penetration...|$|R
5000|$|The Jaguar V12 {{piston engine}} {{was one of}} the premier powerplants of the 1970s and 1980s. [...] It was first seen in the Series 3 Jaguar E-type of 1971 and was based loosely on an earlier design for an {{intended}} Le Mans car, the Jaguar XJ13. The V12 was only Jaguar's second engine design to go into production {{in the history of the}} company. The all-alloy block was fitted with removable wet liners and had a SOHC two-valve alloy head with flat block mating surface, and the combustion chamber in the <b>piston</b> <b>crown</b> carved in a shallow cup form.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the flow}} has stopped, the booster is started, {{and as the}} piston withdraws along the cylinder, {{increasing}} the volume between the cylinder head and the <b>piston</b> <b>crown,</b> the pressure in the cylinder will drop, and gas will flow in from the inlet port. On the return cycle, the piston moves toward the cylinder head, decreasing {{the volume of the}} space and compressing the gas until the pressure is sufficient to overcome the pressure in the outlet line and the opening pressure of the outlet valve. At that point, the gas will flow out of the cylinder via the outlet valve and port.|$|E
50|$|Contrary {{unlike other}} rotaries, the early Gnome engines like the Gnome Omega, Lambda and Delta used a unique {{arrangement}} of valves in order to eliminate pushrods that operated during the inlet phase of the combustion cycle on more conventional engines. Instead, a single exhaust valve on the cylinder head was operated by a pushrod that opened the valve when the pressure dropped {{at the end of}} the power stroke. A pressure-operated inlet valve, which was balanced by a counterweight to equalize the centrifugal forces, was placed in the centre of the <b>piston</b> <b>crown,</b> where it opened to allow the fuel-air charge to enter from the engine's central crankcase.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPistons of IC {{engines are}} {{typically}} subjected during operation to {{high cycle fatigue}} loading cycles at high temperatures (up to 350 °C) in areas facing the combustion chamber. During operation the high temperature exposure results in a progressive loss of fatigue strength of the material at the weakest areas of the piston and may eventually results in a premature failure by crack initiation and propagation. The quantification of the temperature effect on fatigue strength inevitably require experimentation since such data are scarce. An extensive fatigue testing program of eutectic Al-Si alloys at room temperature and at several high temperatures (250 °C, 300 °C and 350 °C) is reported. Specimens were extracted from <b>piston</b> <b>crowns</b> and tested in a rotating bending test machine. The resulting fatigue strength loss at 107 cycles is quantified by a staircase approach. The influence of the test temperature is investigated in terms of chemical composition, process route and of mechanisms of fracture observed in the broken specimens...|$|R

The parts code prefix was 078 and the identification codes were: early version, 2000 (EU2 compliant): ASJ, and later version, 2000-01 (to EU3 standard): AZR. [...] This engine was developed and manufactured in the UK by Cosworth Technology (now known as MAHLE Powertrain).

[...] The modifications increased the engine's output from [...] and [...] of torque in S4 form to [...] at 7,000revolutions per minute (rpm) and [...] at 6,000rpm. [...] The engine was controlled by a Bosch Motronic ME7.1 electronic engine control unit (ECU), using a Bosch 'E-Gas' electronic drive by wire throttle. [...] The engine had multipoint sequential fuel injection, a MAF, six individual single-spark coils and NGK longlife spark plugs. [...] The engine oil was cooled by a dual oil:water cooler and an oil:air cooler.|$|R
50|$|Matti Holtzberg first {{attempted}} to make polymer pistons for an Austin Mini engine in 1969. The pistons ran for only 20 minutes until failure.
