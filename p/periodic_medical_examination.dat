40|$|Objectives. We {{aimed to}} {{describe}} how work exposure and occupational health is assessed for mine workers in Murmansk Oblast, Russia. Study design. A descriptive study based on current practice, laws and available literature. Methods. The information and data were obtained from scientific publications, reports, regional and federal statistics, legal documents, through personal visits and onsite inspections. Results. Several institutions are involved in these assessments, but all mine workers have been examined by specialists at one institution, which helps {{to ensure that the}} work is of stable quality and adds reliability value to the numbers. Workplace risks are assigned hazard grades, which influence the frequency of <b>periodic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>examinations</b> and salary levels. The examinations are aimed to diagnose latent or manifest occupational disease. This may lead to relocation to a workplace with lower exposure levels, free medical treatment, compensation and a lower pension age. Conclusions. Regulations and systems to protect the health of mine workers have more emphasis on control and repair than on prevention. Since relocation can lower the salary, some workers may under-report medical problems. To what degree this happens is unknown.

40|$|Periodic {{occupational}} health examinations often require venepuncture. Acute {{psychological and physical}} stressors during such a procedure result in sympathetic stimulation and increased salivary protein secretion, including salivary alpha-amylase (SAA). We studied SAA response to venepuncture during such an examination. Fifty eight healthy males undergoing <b>periodic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>examination</b> reported perceived stress level (PSL) scores (on a 5 -point scale) and provided passive drool saliva samples at 15 -min (T 1) and 1 -min before (T 2); and 1 -min (T 3) and 15 -min after venepuncture (T 4). A subset of 33 participants available for repeat examination on a control day {{when there was no}} venepuncture provided saliva samples at the corresponding times for comparison. Saliva SAA activity levels were analysed using a salivary α-amylase assay kit (Salimetrics LLC, USA) Among 58 participants, mean SAA increased from T 1 (89. 95 U/L) to T 2 (109. 5 U/L) and T 3 (116. 9 U/L). SAA remained elevated 15 minutes after venepuncture (121. 0 U/L). A positive trend in the difference of SAA between T 3 and T 1 was noted among subjects with increasing mean PSL scores. T 3 -T 1 values were 0. 6 (among those with PSL ≤ 1, n= 24), 11. 3 (among those with PSL between 1 and 1. 5, n= 18) and 78. 9 (among those with PSL > 1. 5, n= 16). SAA increment over 4 time points was significantly higher on the venepuncture compared to the control day (p= 0. 021). SAA increases in response to the acute stress of venepuncture during a <b>periodic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>examination,</b> and remains elevated 15 minutes after the procedure.

40|$|Reliable {{detection}} of pacemaker pulses {{is getting more}} and more important in electrocardiography (ECG) diagnosis. Many studies recommend ECG amplifiers with higher bandwidth to prevent errors. In the past, few pilot studies showed that analysis of pacemaker pulses waveform can enhance diagnosis (eg, lead failure and fractured wire), but they were carried out with inadequate instrumentations for clinical practice. Typically, pacemaker pulses last hundreds of microseconds, edges of pulses elapse in few microseconds, and amplitude may exhibit large variations from few millivolts to volts. Pulse waveforms change often and depend on pacemaker type and programming. A simple, biopotential amplifier made of a few off-the-shelf components is proposed. The circuit fulfills specifications for biopotential amplifiers and offers a large bandwidth (~ 1 MHz). Therefore, it is able to accurately record time course of pacemaker pulses and allows highly accurate pulse detection and timing. Signals can be easily displayed and acquired by means of a standard, battery-powered oscilloscope. Pacemaker pulse vectorcardiography can be obtained by using two or more, wideband channels.

They address a vital issue in clinical aviation medicine, and conclude that {{the current system of}} pre-employment <b>medical</b> <b>examination</b> is of limited value. I would like to add some remarks from my personal point of view. The Royal Air Force is in a privileged position if they can obtain a general practitioner report for applicants prior to training to confirm the medical history. For legal reasons, this is impossible in Germany, possibly leading to a devaluation of the initial examination. For future changes in the content and frequency of aircrew <b>periodic</b> <b>medical</b> <b>examinations,</b> two points of view should be considered: the aero medical community should establish a consensus (like the 1 % rule) for the amount of medical risk that can be accepted for aviation safety. If the magnitude of the acceptable risk is known and clear, pre-employment <b>medical</b> <b>examinations</b> can be tailored to detect that risk. A second important issue would be a consensus on the acceptable amount of false-positive findings obtained in the pre-employment <b>medical</b> <b>examinations.</b> Since the prevalence of any disorder in the flying community is presumed to be low, the positive predictive value of any test will be low. In the normal care-giving medical situation, the a priori probability for the target disorder can be determined by history and physical examination.
