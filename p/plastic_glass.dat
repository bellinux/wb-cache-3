25|$|Mechanical filter {{respirators}} retain {{particulate matter}} such as dust created during woodworking or metal processing, when contaminated air is {{passed through the}} filter material. Wool is still used today as a filter, along with <b>plastic,</b> <b>glass,</b> cellulose, and combinations {{of two or more}} of these materials. Since the filters cannot be cleaned and reused and have a limited lifespan, cost and disposability are key factors. Single-use, disposable and replaceable cartridge models exist.|$|E
25|$|The {{level of}} {{contamination}} of the feedstock material is a key consideration. If the feedstock to the digesters has significant levels of physical contaminants, such as <b>plastic,</b> <b>glass,</b> or metals, then processing to remove the contaminants will be required for the material to be used. If it is not removed, then the digesters can be blocked and will not function efficiently. It is with this understanding that mechanical biological treatment plants are designed. The higher the level of pretreatment a feedstock requires, the more processing machinery will be required, and, hence, the project will have higher capital costs.|$|E

2500|$|The {{presence}} of surface charge imbalance {{means that the}} objects will exhibit attractive or repulsive forces. This surface charge imbalance, which yields static electricity, can be generated by touching two differing surfaces together and then separating them due to the phenomena of contact electrification and the triboelectric effect. Rubbing two nonconductive objects generates {{a great amount of}} static electricity. This is not just the result of friction; two nonconductive surfaces can become charged by just being placed {{one on top of the}} other. Since most surfaces have a rough texture, it takes longer to achieve charging through contact than through rubbing. Rubbing objects together increases amount of adhesive contact between the two surfaces. Usually insulators, e.g., substances that do not conduct electricity, are good at both generating, and holding, a surface charge. [...] Some examples of these substances are rubber, <b>plastic,</b> <b>glass,</b> and pith. Conductive objects only rarely generate charge imbalance except, for example, when a metal surface is impacted by solid or liquid nonconductors. The charge that is transferred during contact electrification is stored on the surface of each object. Static electric generators, devices which produce very high voltage at very low current and used for classroom physics demonstrations, rely on this effect.|$|E

40|$|Background: Conjunctival {{contamination}} from splashed debris during orthopaedic {{surgical procedures}} places surgeons {{at risk for}} communicable diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B and C. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the effectiveness of various types of protective eyewear in preventing conjunctival contamination. Methods: A simulation model was constructed with use of a mannequin head in a typical position of a surgeon’s head during an operation. The head was placed at an appropriate distance from the surgical field, and a femoral osteotomy was performed on a cadaver thigh. Six experimental groups were tested to determine the ability of various types of eye protection to prevent contamination of the conjunctiva: (1) modern prescription glasses, (2) standard surgical telescopic loupes, (3) hard <b>plastic</b> contoured <b>glasses,</b> (4) disposable <b>plastic</b> <b>glasses,</b> (5) a combination facemask and eye shield, and (6) no protection (control). Thirty femoral osteotomies were performed, and contamination of both the protective devices and the simulated conjunctival surfaces were recorded. Results: None of the tested devices were completely effective. The modern prescription glasses and the controls both were associated with conjunctival contamination rates of 83 %. The other eye protective devices were associated with significantly lower rates of overall contamination, with a rate of 50 % for the loupes, 30 % for the facemask and eye shield, 17 % for the hard <b>plastic</b> <b>glasses,</b> and 3 % for the disposable <b>plastic</b> <b>glasses.</b> Conclusions: Modern prescription glasses provided no benefit over the control in our experimental model; therefore...|$|R
