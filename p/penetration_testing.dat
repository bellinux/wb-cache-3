40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} the feasibility of conducting <b>penetration</b> <b>tests</b> on high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters as installed in nuclear ventilation systems. The in-place <b>penetration</b> <b>test,</b> {{which is designed to}} yield equivalent penetration measurements as the standard DOP efficiency test, is based on measuring the aerosol penetration of the filter installation as a function of particle size using a portable laser particle counter.

Test results show the in-place <b>penetration</b> <b>test</b> is more sensitive than the in-place leak test, has a similar operating procedure, but takes longer to conduct.
