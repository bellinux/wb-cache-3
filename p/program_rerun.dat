As the top-rated show in all of syndication at this point, Sheindlin defeated not only first-run syndication programs but also off-network syndication <b>programs</b> (<b>rerun</b> episodes of <b>programs</b> off their original network). The title of overall syndication leader was previously held by off-network syndicated program Two and a Half Men (2010-11) and before that, first-run syndicated program Wheel of Fortune (2009-10).|$|R
50|$|Drive time {{programming}} is almost exclusively restricted to during the work week. On weekends, because driving habits {{are much less}} uniform, lower profile <b>programs</b> (often <b>reruns</b> or brokered <b>programming)</b> typically air in the respective time slots.|$|R
5000|$|Nick at Nite {{has used}} {{a myriad of}} unusual and unorthodox commercials, logos and promotions. Alan Goodman and Fred Seibert {{assembled}} a team of highly imaginative writer/producers, modeled on their original 1981 creative team that had launched sister channel MTV. The group - which included Scott Webb, Jim Levi, Dave Potorti, Jay Newell, Will McRobb, and Tom Hill - was guided towards creating a series of internal campaigns to emphasize the seeming paradox of a contemporary network setting that <b>programmed</b> <b>reruns</b> from the 1960s and earlier. A series of five [...] "promises" [...] were organized into four 30-second spots each hour, each emphasizing an attribute of the innovative programming format.|$|R

30|$|Nectar [29] for Dryad links {{data and}} the {{computation}} that generated it as unified hybrid cacheable element. When data is unused for long, it is removed and replaced by the computation that produced it to be rerun later if needed. On Dryad <b>programs</b> <b>reruns,</b> Nectar replaces results partially, or totally, with cached data. Dryad programs need to be enhanced with cache management calls that check and update the cache server. Cached results and modified programs are managed in a central store. Cacheable elements include sub-expressions, and DAGs shared by different processes operating on the same data. Like InCoop, Nectar is advantageous only for scenarios where input/output is repeated, whereas the QoD model fits {{a broader range of}} scenarios.|$|R
50|$|TV8's <b>programming</b> {{consists}} of <b>reruns</b> of comedy shows, crime shows, UEFA Europa League matches, Moto GP, and movies.|$|R
50|$|Serials rely {{on keeping}} the full {{nature of the}} story hidden and {{revealing}} elements episode by episode to keep viewers tuning in to learn more. Often these shows employ recapping segments {{at the beginning and}} cliffhangers {{at the end of each}} episode. Such shows also place a demand on viewers to tune into every episode to follow the plot. The invention of recording devices such as VCRs and DVRs has made following these type of shows easier, which has resulted in increased success and popularity. Prior to the advent of DVRs, television networks shunned serials in prime time as they made broadcast <b>programming</b> <b>reruns</b> more difficult and television producers shunned them because they were tougher to go into broadcast syndication years down the road.|$|R
50|$|By 1984, {{the network}} became a general {{entertainment}} basic cable channel, offering {{a combination of}} Televisa <b>programming</b> and SIN <b>reruns.</b>|$|R

50|$|Until the Fall of 2013, Much has premiered many of MTV's scripted series. The channel {{continues}} to air these <b>programs</b> in off-network <b>reruns.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 2003-2004 season {{marked the}} final {{time that the}} major {{networks}} scheduled substantial original scripted drama series on Saturdays. After years of declining ratings on that particular evening, beginning with the 2004-2005 season the networks ceased scheduling original dramas on Saturdays, choosing instead to fill the schedule with non-fiction <b>programming</b> and <b>reruns.</b>|$|R

50|$|In January 2009, CHCH's Morning Live {{programme}} {{began to}} be simulcast on former Toronto sister station CIII-TV owing to the cancellation of its own morning newscast Global News Morning. The simulcast on CIII was dropped {{at the end of}} August after Channel Zero took control of CHCH, with CIII replacing it with lifestyle <b>programming</b> <b>reruns</b> and rebroadcasts of its 11:00 p.m. newscast from the previous night. While the station continued to share helicopter traffic services provided by the Canadian Traffic Network, the arrangement between Canwest and CHCH ended on December 31, 2009 as Canwest held the exclusive rights to CTN services in the Greater Toronto Area. Upon becoming an independent station on August 31, 2009, the station adopted a news-intensive format, replacing network programming in the 9:00 a.m. to noon and 1:00 to 4:00 p.m. periods on weekdays with expanded newscasts.|$|R

Traditionally, {{the network was}} dedicated solely to court and legal based shows, capturing live footage from actual homicidal trials, criminal justice <b>programming,</b> and <b>reruns</b> of such shows as NYPD Blue and Cops. However, since its [...] "TruTV" [...] revamping, the network has branched out into more [...] "caught on video" [...] reality programs.|$|R
5000|$|The X in its callsign {{stands for}} [...] "Experimental", as WGBX (more {{primarily}} in the 1970s) was home to programming that was given a trial run on the lower-rated UHF signal before possibly moving onto the more-established WGBH-TV. Such Eastern Educational Network imports from the United Kingdom as Doctor Who were seen first or more frequently on WGBX, and one late 1970s local [...] "nightclub"-style variety show, Club 44, proved popular enough to be moved over to WGBH and retitled The Club. The station airs PBS programs that are not aired by WGBH-TV as well as additional supplemental <b>programming.</b> <b>Reruns</b> of the previous night's programming either from WGBH-TV or from WGBX-TV itself also makes up part of channel 44's programming schedule. WGBX also carries the digital subchannels owned by the WGBH Educational Foundation; this enables WGBH to maintain a full 1080i high definition picture resolution on its main channel 2 signal, without any loss in visual quality.|$|R
