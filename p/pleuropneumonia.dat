40|$|Actinobacillus <b>pleuropneumoniae,</b> a porcine {{respiratory}} tract pathogen, {{has been shown}} to express transferrin-binding proteins and urease during infection. Both activities have been associated with virulence; however, their functional role for infection has not yet been elucidated. We used two isogenic A. <b>pleuropneumoniae</b> single mutants (ΔexbB and ΔureC) and a newly constructed A. <b>pleuropneumoniae</b> double (ΔureC ΔexbB) mutant in aerosol infection experiments. Neither the A. <b>pleuropneumoniae</b> ΔexbB mutant nor the double ΔureC ΔexbB mutant was able to colonize sufficiently long to initiate a detectable humoral immune response. These results imply that the ability to utilize transferrin-bound iron is required for multiplication and persistence of A. <b>pleuropneumoniae</b> in the porcine {{respiratory tract}}. The A. <b>pleuropneumoniae</b> ΔureC mutant and the parent strain both caused infections that were indistinguishable from one another in the acute phase of disease; however, 3 weeks postinfection the A. <b>pleuropneumoniae</b> ΔureC mutant, in contrast to the parent strain, could not be isolated from healthy lung tissue. In addition, the local immune response—as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter and enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot analyses—revealed a significantly higher number of A. pleuropneumoniae-specific B cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of pigs infected with the A. <b>pleuropneumoniae</b> ΔureC mutant than in the BALF of those infected with the parent strain.

The {{early detection of}} pigs subclinically infected with A. <b>pleuropneumoniae</b> is a critical step in avoiding the introduction of this agent into naïve populations. Negative herds are usually monitored {{for the presence of}} A. <b>pleuropneumoniae</b> using serology.

At this time, there is no information available on how these tests compare regarding detection of A. <b>pleuropneumoniae</b> infection or which combination of tests provides a better definition of true infection status.

A. porcitonsillarum is hemolytic but unlike A. <b>pleuropneumoniae,</b> it contains only apxII genes and not apxI or apxIII genes. In contrast to the truncated apxII operon of A. <b>pleuropneumoniae,</b> which lacks the type I secretion genes BD, characterization of the apxII operon in A. porcitonsillarum revealed that it contains an intact and complete apxII operon. This shows a typical RTX operon structure with the gene arrangement apxIICABD. The region upstream of the apxII operon is also different from that in A. <b>pleuropneumoniae</b> and contains an additional gene, aspC, encoding a putative aspartate aminotransferase.

Our data demonstrated that A. <b>pleuropneumoniae</b> could synthesize PLP by PdxS and PdxT enzymes.
