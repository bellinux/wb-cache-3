However, a sports school's basketball coach who noticed Yi's potential in playing street basketball persuaded Yi's family to {{allow him to}} train professionally. Hoping to sign Yi to an endorsement deal, Adidas invited him to attend the company's ABCD camp in New Jersey in 2002, where he competed against all-American high school players.|$|E
5|$|Garza {{lived with}} her parents, and on Saturday, April 16, 1960, she told them {{that she was going}} to {{confession}} at Sacred Heart Church in McAllen. Garza was often conspicuous in the congregation because of her striking appearance, and several parishioners remembered seeing Garza at the church that night. When Garza's <b>parents</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> hear from her that evening, they first thought that she had stayed at the church for midnight mass. When Garza did not return home by 3:00 am, Nicolas and Josefina went to the McAllen Police Department to report their daughter missing.|$|E
5|$|Trapper Nelson {{was born}} Vincent Nostokovich (or Natulkiewicz) to Polish {{immigrant}} parents in Trenton, New Jersey, in 1908 or 1909. As a boy, {{to earn money}} he began trapping animals such as muskrats in the marshes of New Jersey. His <b>parents</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> speak English, so Nelson would often assist them in translating {{to make sure they}} were not taken advantage of. However, when his mother died and his father remarried, Nelson ran away from home, heading west.|$|E

5|$|Jose Sarria {{was born}} to Julio Sarria and Maria Dolores Maldonado. His <b>parents</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> marry and his father showed no {{interest}} in his son's life. Maria initially raised José Julio Sarria on her own, but when this became too difficult she placed him with another couple. Both they and his mother indulged his early interest in wearing girl's clothing. Sarria showed an affinity for languages, which led to his first serious romance with another man. Sarria tutored Paul Kolish, an Austrian baron who had fled from the Nazis. Sarria and Kolish fell in love, and their relationship endured until Kolish and his son {{were killed in a}} car accident in 1947.|$|E
5|$|Libby accuses Zeke {{of writing}} Kyle Canning's (Christopher Milligan) essay for him, but Sunny reveals that she wrote it. Kyle was blackmailing her after he overheard Sunny telling Donna that her <b>parents</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know about Zeke moving home. Karl and Susan make Sunny call {{her parents and}} tell them about Zeke. Sunny tells them that her parents want her to come home. Zeke tells Sunny that he will go to South Korea with her. However, when Sunny realises how much Susan and Karl need him, she tells him to stay. On her last day, Zeke organises a picnic and a {{performance}} at Charlie's from The Black Skirts. A few days after her departure, Sunny texts Zeke and tells him not to contact her again.|$|E
5|$|Sullivan never married, but he {{had serious}} love affairs with several women. The first was with Rachel Scott Russell (1845–1882), the {{daughter}} of the engineer John Scott Russell. Sullivan was a frequent visitor at the Scott Russell home in the mid-1860s, and by 1865 the affair was in full bloom. Rachel's <b>parents</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> approve of a possible union with a young composer with uncertain financial prospects, but the two continued to see each other covertly. At some point in 1868, Sullivan started a simultaneous (and secret) affair with Rachel's sister Louise (1841–1878). Both relationships had ceased by early 1869.|$|E

5|$|The archdiocese assumed {{control of}} the orphanage in 1920, and began {{accepting}} orphans from the Juvenile Court of Cook County, most of whom came from broken homes whose <b>parents</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> pay the fines imposed by the court. This discouraged donations and strained the orphanage financially. Archbishop Samuel Cardinal Stritch, discovering that only 12 of the 255 children were actually orphans and only five of them were Slavs, closed the orphanage in 1956. The 12 true orphans were moved to Holy Angels Orphanage in Des Plaines. Bishop of Joliet Martin Dewey McNamara gave the former orphanage buildings to St. Procopius Academy, which {{was at that time}} still combined with the college.|$|E
5|$|He {{joined his}} {{hometown}} football club, AIK Bačka Topola, as a youngster, and graduated {{to the senior}} side in 1998–99. He began as a centre back, but soon realised he preferred scoring goals to defending. Žigić's <b>parents</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want him to take football seriously until he completed his education, and he remained with AIK Bačka Topola until 2001, scoring 68 goals in 76 matches in the Serbian League Vojvodina, the third level of Yugoslav football. When military service took him to Bar, {{he was able to}} play for the local club, Mornar, for whom he scored 15 goals from 23 appearances in the 2001–02 Second League of FR Yugoslavia. After trials in France with Saint-Étienne and Créteil came to nothing, Žigić returned home where he played 8 matches for third-tier club Kolubara, scoring 3 goals.|$|E
5|$|By the show's tenth {{anniversary in}} 1979, 9 million American {{children}} under the age of six were watching Sesame Street daily. Four out of five children had watched it over a six-week period, and 90% of children from low-income inner-city homes regularly viewed the show. According to a 1993 survey conducted by the US Department of Education, out of the show's 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly watched it. 77% of preschoolers watched it once a week, and 86% of kindergartners, first-, and second-grade students had watched it once a week before starting school. The show reached most young children in almost all demographic groups, most significantly economically disadvantaged children; 88% of children from low-income families and 90% of both African-American and Latino children watched the show before entering kindergarten. Over 80% of children from all minority language groups watched it before starting school. Children from the poorest communities were most likely to be regular viewers, as were younger children. Children whose <b>parents</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> read to them regularly were less likely to be regular viewers, and children of highly educated parents stopped viewing earlier than children from disadvantaged households.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} modern family, trust and {{negotiation}} are important strategies {{to build a}} respectful and honoring relationship.

Parents prepare youth to be independent and responsible individuals by encouraging emancipation from the family. <b>Parents</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> impose strict rules interfering with youth freedom. Youth setting boundaries on providing information to parents is acceptable. The ideal is to maintain a continuous and friction free dialogue between parents and youth.|$|R

25|$|Kindergarten {{has been}} shown to improve school {{readiness}} in children at risk. Children attending a kindergarten were less likely to have impaired speech or impaired motor development. Only 50% of children whose <b>parents</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> graduate from school are ready for school at age six. If such children were enrolled in a high-quality three-year Kindergarten programme, 87% were ready for school at age six. Thus Kindergarten helps to overcome unequal opportunities.|$|E

Largely owing to this association, Ruskin's <b>parents</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> attend.
