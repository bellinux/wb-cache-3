5|$|A Spanish-built {{version of}} the Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-2, the 1954 Hispano Aviación HA-1112-M1L Buchon, was built in Hispano's factory in Seville with the Rolls-Royce Merlin 500/45 engine of – a fitting {{powerplant}} for the last-produced {{version of the}} famous Messerschmitt fighter, as the Bf 109 V1 <b>prototype</b> <b>aircraft</b> had been powered by the Rolls-Royce Kestrel V-12 engine in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Concorde's Air Intake Control Units (AICUs) {{made use}} of a digital {{processor}} to provide the necessary accuracy for intake control. It was the world's first use of a digital processor to be given full authority control of an essential system in a passenger aircraft. It {{was developed by the}} Electronics and Space Systems (ESS) division of the British Aircraft Corporation after {{it became clear that the}} analogue AICUs fitted to the <b>prototype</b> <b>aircraft</b> and developed by Ultra Electronics were found to be insufficiently accurate for the tasks in hand.|$|E

5|$|The USAF {{eventually}} gave up {{fighting for}} its {{production and the}} B-70 program was canceled in 1961. Development was then turned over to a research program to {{study the effects of}} long-duration high-speed flight. As such, two <b>prototype</b> <b>aircraft,</b> designated XB-70A, were built; these aircraft were used for supersonic test-flights during 1964–69. In 1966, one prototype crashed after colliding with a smaller aircraft while flying in close formation; the remaining Valkyrie bomber is in the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|The <b>prototype</b> <b>aircraft,</b> {{registered}} N767BA {{and equipped}} with JT9D turbofans, rolled out on August 4, 1981. By this time, the 767 program had accumulated 173 firm orders from 17 customers, including Air Canada, All Nippon Airways, Britannia Airways, Transbrasil, and Trans World Airlines (TWA). On September 26, 1981, the prototype took its maiden flight {{under the command}} of company test pilots Tommy Edmonds, Lew Wallick, and John Brit. The maiden flight was largely uneventful, save for the inability to retract the landing gear because of a hydraulic fluid leak. The prototype was used for subsequent flight tests.|$|E
5|$|The Hawker Siddeley Harrier, {{developed}} in the 1960s, {{was the first of}} the Harrier Jump Jet series of aircraft. It was the first operational close-support and reconnaissance fighter aircraft with vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) capabilities and the only truly successful V/STOL design of the many that arose in that era. The Harrier was developed directly from the Hawker Siddeley Kestrel <b>prototype</b> <b>aircraft,</b> following the cancellation of a more advanced supersonic aircraft, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154. The British Royal Air Force (RAF) ordered the Harrier GR.1 and GR.3 variants in the late 1960s. It was exported to the United States as the AV-8A, for use by the US Marine Corps (USMC), in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Mooney {{stated that}} they needed orders for 100 {{aircraft}} to launch production of the TX-1, but these did not occur, and no production followed. The <b>prototype's</b> <b>aircraft</b> registration was cancelled in 1989.|$|R
