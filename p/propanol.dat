Catalytic performance of supported metal catalysts (metal: Rh, Ru, Pt, Pd support: active carbon, SiO 2, Al 2 O 3) was evaluated in the reaction of glycerol aqueous solution under H 2.

25|$|In general, the {{hydroxyl}} group makes the alcohol molecule polar. Those groups can form hydrogen bonds {{to one another}} and to other compounds (except in certain large molecules where the hydroxyl is protected by steric hindrance of adjacent groups). This hydrogen bonding means that alcohols can be used as protic solvents. Two opposing solubility trends in alcohols are: the tendency of the polar OH to promote solubility in water, and the tendency of the carbon chain to resist it. Thus, methanol, ethanol, and <b>propanol</b> are miscible in water because the {{hydroxyl group}} wins out over the short carbon chain. Butanol, with a four-carbon chain, is moderately soluble because of a balance between the two trends. Alcohols of five or more carbons such as pentanol and higher are effectively insoluble in water because of the hydrocarbon chain's dominance. All simple alcohols are miscible in organic solvents.|$|E

40|$|The {{global demand}} for energy, fuels and chemicals, {{along with the}} decline in fossil fuel {{resources}} has significantly led {{to the rise of}} renewable energy sources. In this regard, biomass represents one of the most promising, alternative resources for the sustainable production of fuels and chemicals. Biodiesel derived from plant biomass is a renewable fuel produced on a large scale over the past decade by the transesterification of oils. Glycerol {{is considered to be a}} promising three carbon feedstock, obtained in large quantities as a by-product during biodiesel production. Since glycerol can be obtained from renewable sources, it clearly emerged as a versatile feedstock instead of petroleum based chemicals. This generated a lot of interest in developing new valorisation technologies to produce high value tonnage chemicals from glycerol by sustainable processes. One such attractive application is the catalytic hydrogenolysis of glycerol to value-added chemicals such as propanediols and <b>propanols.</b> Due to the broad applications of these compounds, glycerol hydrogenolysis has been extensively studied in the past decade, both in liquid phase and in vapour phase, for which various metal-based catalysts have been explored, including supported Rh, Ni, Ru, Pt and Cu. Present research work is mainly focussed on the selective production of 1, 3 -propanediol and <b>propanols</b> through glycerol hydrogenolysis over platinum-based catalysts in vapour phase at moderate reaction temperatures and atmospheric pressure. In this work, various supported platinum catalysts have been synthesised by wet impregnation method. The supports used in the study include zirconia, sulphated zirconia, gamma alumina, aluminium phosphate, activated carbon, Y-zeolite, H-mordenite and SBA- 15. In addition, metal acid bifunctional catalysts such as Pt-HPAs/ZrO 2 and Pt-WO 3 /SBA- 15 have been synthesized via sequential and co-impregnation methods. The prepared catalysts were well characterized by various spectro-analytical techniques and the catalytic properties were evaluated for selective hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1, 3 -propanediol and <b>propanols</b> in vapour phase under atmospheric pressure. A detailed study investigated the influence of metal loading, reaction temperature, reduction temperature, glycerol concentration, hydrogen flow rate, feed flow rate, catalyst amount and time on stream studies. In addition, structural aspects of spent catalysts were also evaluated to study possible catalyst deactivation. The investigated catalysts exhibited moderate to high activity towards glycerol hydrogenolysis with optimal conversion and selectivity. Metal dispersion and acidity of the catalysts were found to be the key parameters for the catalytic performance of various supported platinum catalysts in glycerol hydrogenolysis as evidenced by the results obtained from various characterization techniques. It is proposed that glycerol hydrogenolysis proceeds via a two-step mechanism involving the dehydration of glycerol to 3 -hydroxy propionaldehyde over acidic sites and further hydrogenation into 1, 3 -propanediol over metal sites. The sequential hydrogenolysis of propanediols over strong acidic sites leads to the formation of lower alcohols such as 1 -propanol and 2 -propanol. The present study was successful in providing a sustainable and economically viable methodology to convert biomass-derived glycerol into value-added chemicals, such as 1, 3 -propanediol and <b>propanols.</b> The supported platinum catalysts were proven to be highly efficient catalysts for selective glycerol hydrogenolysis with excellent conversions and selectivities towards the desired products...|$|R

PTR-MS sensitivities towards glycolaldehyde, ethyl acetate, and peroxyacetic acid at m/z 61 are comparable to that for AA; when present, these species will interfere with ambient AA measurements by PTR-MS. Likewise, when it is present, dimethyl ether can interfere with FA measurements. For a reduced electric field (E/N) of 125 Townsend (Td), the PTR-MS sensitivity towards ethanol at m/z 47 is 5 – 20 times lower than for FA; ethanol will then only be an important interference when present in much higher abundance than FA. Sensitivity towards 2 -propanol is < 1 % of that for AA, so that <b>propanols</b> will not in general represent a significant interference for AA. Hydrated product ions of AA, glycolaldehyde, and <b>propanols</b> occur at m/z 79, which is also commonly used to measure benzene. However, the resulting interference for benzene is only significant when E/N is low (≲ 100 Td). Addition of water vapor affects the PTR-MS response to a given compound by (i) changing the yield for fragmentation reactions and (ii) increasing the importance of ligand switching reactions. In the case of AA, sensitivity to the molecular ion increases with humidity at low E/N but decreases with humidity at high E/N due to water-driven fragmentation. Sensitivity towards FA decreases with humidity throughout {{the full range of}} E/N. For glycolaldehyde and the alcohols, the sensitivity increases with humidity due to ligand switching reactions (at low E/N) and reduced fragmentation in the presence of water (at high E/N). Their role as interferences will typically be greatest at high humidity. For compounds such as AA where the humidity effect depends strongly on the collisional energy in the drift tube, simple humidity correction factors (X R) will only be relevant for a specific instrumental configuration. We recommend E/N ~ 125 Td as an effective condition for AA and FA measurements by PTR-MS, as it optimizes between the competing E/N -dependent mechanisms controlling their sensitivities and those of the interfering species.
