If chlorothiazide is present also, however, the ratio remains constant at 0. 7. Changes in the plasma <b>pempidine</b> concentration in vivo probably result from the binding of <b>pempidine</b> to plasma protein in the presence of chlorothiazide.

40|$|The central vasomotor {{effects of}} <b>pempidine</b> were studied in {{dogs and cats}} anaesthetized with {{pentobarbitone}} sodium, and in spinal cats. <b>Pempidine</b> lowered the threshold of electrical stimulation of the medulla oblongata to evoke a pressor response when given intravenously to cats in a dose insufficient to block autonomic ganglia. Injection of a small dose into the cerebral ventricles of dogs produced {{an increase in the}} pressor responses to occlusion of the carotid artery and to electrical stimulation of the central end of the cut vagus. In the spinal cat small doses of <b>pempidine,</b> given either intravenously or intrathecally, augmented the rise in blood pressure resulting from compression of the spinal cord. Since all these effects were produced by <b>pempidine</b> in doses insufficient to cause ganglionic block, the observed effects are attributed to central facilitation of the vasomotor responses.

40|$|Mecamylamine, {{dimecamine}} and <b>pempidine</b> {{differed in}} neuromuscular-blocking {{activity on the}} isolated phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation of the rat from the corresponding methiodides {{by a factor of}} less than two. It was concluded that the active component of each amine was the cation acting extracellularly. The finding that the neuromuscular-blocking activity of mecamylamine at pH 6. 7 was similar to the activity at pH 7. 7 did not refute this conclusion. Mecamylamine, dimecamine methiodide, dimecamine and <b>pempidine,</b> at concentrations insufficient to cause block, could increase the twitch response of the rat diaphragm; the ability to do this increased in the above order. With <b>pempidine</b> (the most active compound) this effect, on the isolated sartorius muscle of the frog, was a direct action. During steady partial block by each of the compounds, the responses to brief tetanic stimulation, to neostigmine and to an increase in calcium concentration were similar to those observed during block by tubocurarine.

40|$|<b>Pempidine,</b> {{and other}} highly active {{ganglion}} blocking {{agents of the}} polyalkylpiperidine series, were developed from tertiary alkylamines, themselves weakly active, on the hypothesis that high activity was conferred by the presence in the molecule of a sterically hindered secondary or tertiary nitrogen atom. <b>Pempidine</b> and its N-ethyl homologue (26539) resembled mecamylamine qualitatively. All three drugs blocked sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia; this action was slow in onset and protracted. They blocked neuromuscular transmission, but only about one hundredth as powerfully as ganglionic transmission. They caused a fall in amplitude and rate of the isolated heart, and reduced coronary flow. They had local anaesthetic properties in one of four tests used. They caused tremor. All were well absorbed when administered orally. <b>Pempidine</b> was about twice as active as mecamylamine on ganglia, but only about one half to one quarter as toxic as judged by death, growth, induction of tremor, or cardiotoxicity. Compound 26539 was also quantitatively superior to mecamylamine in respect of these safety margins, but unlike <b>pempidine</b> or mecamylamine damaged the pituitary gland and testis when administered daily for several months.

40|$|Antagonists {{have been}} crucial in the {{characterization}} of nicotine 2 ̆ 7 s pharmacology. Initial evidence {{for the existence of}} central nicotinic receptors was {{based on the fact that}} nicotine produced a number of behavioral effects that were antagonized by ganglionic blockers that crossed the blood-brain barrier, such as mecamylamine and <b>pempidine.</b> Although the mechanism of action of these compounds has been studied extensively in the periphery, little is known about their mechanisms of action in the brain. These compounds are thought to be noncompetitive antagonists due to the fact that they do not compete for agonist binding to brain homogenate in vitro. However, pharmacological evidence in support of noncompetitive antagonism is lacking. Dose-response curves for nicotine were determined in the presence of various doses of <b>pempidine</b> for depression of spontaneous activity and antinociception in mice. <b>Pempidine</b> was found to shift the dose-response curves for these effects of nicotine in a manner consistent with noncompetitive antagonism. A number of mecamylamine analogs were investigated for antagonism of these central effects of nicotine as well. These studies revealed that the N-, 2 -, and 3 -methyls were crucial for optimal efﬁcacy and potency and suggests that these compounds possess a speciﬁc mechanism of action, possibly involving a receptor. Furthermore, the structure-activity relationships for the mecamylamine analogs were found to be different than that previously reported for the agonists, suggesting that they do not act at the same site. The binding of [3 H]-L-nicotine and [3 H]-pempidine was studied in vitro to mouse brain homogenate and in situ to rat brain slices. The in situ binding of [3 H]-L-nicotine to rat brain slices was quantitated autoradiographically to discrete brain areas in the presence and absence of 1, 10 and 100 µM nicotine and <b>pempidine.</b> <b>Pempidine</b> did not effectively displace [3 H]-L-nicotine binding. The studies with [3 H]-pempidine failed to demonstrate saturable binding. The evaluation of the antagonism of nicotine by mecamylamine and <b>pempidine</b> presented in this thesis supports a noncompetitive action of these compounds in the brain. The shift in the dose-response curves for nicotine, the structure-activity relationship for mecamylamine analogs and the binding studies are consistent with this hypothesis. The noncompetitive nature of these compounds suggests that they do not compete for the binding site of the agonist, and that endogenous nicotinic antagonists may exist in the brain...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of camphidonium salt (Camphidonium 2 ̆ 2 Ingelheim 2 ̆ 2) in 6 hypertensive patients and of <b>pempidine</b> salt (Perolysen 2 ̆ 2 Dai-nihon Seiyaku 2 ̆ 2) in 8 hypertensive patients was evaluated with special reference to causal, basal and supplementary pressure level of which clinical importance was emphasized by Prof. Smirk. In {{addition to the}} routine examination, the cardio-vascular dynamics was investigated by Blumberger-Holldack 2 ̆ 7 s and Wezler 2 ̆ 7 s methods. A. Camphidonium: 1. The significant decrease in the optimal pressure range in lying state was observed in 3 of 6 cases. The blood pressure in standing position was significantly lowered in all cases. One patient showed the tolerance during this observation. 2. The tentative name 2 ̆ 2 optimal 2 ̆ 2 is given by Prof. S. Saitoh to the state in which cardio-vascular dynamical values approach to the normal range as near as possible {{with the use of}} depressant drugs. The optimal blood pressure, i. e. the blood pressure measured in the optimal dynamical state is higher than the floor pressure in Prof. Smirk 2 ̆ 7 s sense. The cardio-vascular dynamical analysis shows, as a rule, 2 ̆ 2 Zentralization 2 ̆ 2 (Duesberg u. Schroeder) and 2 ̆ 2 Druckreaktion 2 ̆ 2 (Blumberger) at the floor pressure level obtained by the relatively acute administration of these two sorts of depressant drugs. 3. Side effect of Camphidonium is relatively scanty; constipation is caused 2 ̆ 7 only in the patients with habituation, so far as the therapeutic dosage is medicated. Sometimes transitory weakness, orthostatic dizziness and palpitation appeared {{at the level of the}} floor pressure. One patient claimed the dryness of the mouth, another patient the nasal stoppage. 4. Increase in RBF, decrease in RBF and GFR, or no change in clearance values was seen in each one of three cases. As to PSP test 3 of 4 cases showed no change and the rest a slight turn for the worse. No influence upon urinary findings. Venous pressure tended somewhat to be lowered. Liver function remained unchanged. It may be given as a conclusion that Camphidonium is more potent than C_ 5 and less toxic than C_ 6. B. Pempidine: 1. The significant decrease in the optimal systolic pressure level in lying state was observed in 6 of 8 patients, that in the diastolic in 5 of all. In standing position systolic pressure was significantly lowered in all 7 cases, diastolic in 5 of all. Two patients showed the tolerance during this observation. The depressant potency of <b>Pempidine</b> was enhanced by the increase in blood pH. 2. Either vascular streaming resistance and elasticity module of the hypertensives of W+E 2 ̆ 7 type (Wezler-Boger) or the output of the hypertensives of M type tended to be normalized at the optimal state resulted by the administration of <b>Pempidine.</b> Either 2 ̆ 2 Druckreaktion 2 ̆ 2 (Blumberger) or 2 ̆ 2 Volumenreaktion 2 ̆ 2 which was found among more than one half of all cases showed also the tendency to be normalized with the use of <b>Pempidine.</b> 3. Orthostatism by the administration of <b>Pempidine</b> was more remarkable, as a rule, than that with the use of Camphidonium at the equi-depressant effect. The parasympathetic side effect of <b>Pempidine</b> was usually less than that of Mecamylamine. The combined use of <b>Pempidine</b> as well as Camphidonium with reserpine, chlorothiazide and its derivates reduced the amount of <b>Pempidine</b> as well as Camphidonium, consequently such a combined use enabled to diminish the side effect of these new ganglionic blocking agents. 4. As to PSP test no change was seen in 3, slight turn for the worse in 1 of all 5 cases. The decrease in RBF and GFR was observed in 2, no change of clearance in 2 of all 4 cases. The liquor-, and venous pressure showed tendency to be lowered. In due consideration of the results gained by intravenous and oral route of Camphidonium and <b>Pempidine,</b> it is safe to say that these two ganglionic blocking agents, although quite of different properties, are almost completely and rapid absorbed from the gut, so that the parenteral administration is hardly necessary except for the hypertensive emergency...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pempidine</b> (1 : 2 : 2 : 6 : 6 -pentamethylpiperidine) is a long-acting ganglion-blocking {{compound}} {{which is}} effective by mouth. By intravenous injection {{it has a}} similar potency to hexamethonium on the preganglionically stimulated nictitating membrane of the cat. The compound blocks the effects of intravenous nicotine and of peripheral vagal stimulation on the blood pressure; it also causes dilatation of the pupil after removal of the sympathetic innervation. On the guinea-pig ileum, the predominant effect of the compound is to inhibit nicotine contractions. <b>Pempidine</b> is well absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract as judged by (a) the low ratio (6. 9) of oral to intravenous toxicities, (b) the rapid development of mydriasis in mice after oral administration of small doses, and (c) the rapid onset of hypotension when the compound is injected directly into the duodenum of anaesthetized cats. Other actions include neuromuscular paralysis of curare-like type when large doses of the compound are injected intravenously and central effects such as tremors which occur with near toxic doses. In cats with a low blood pressure, large intravenous doses have a slight pressor action...|$|E

Pharmacol. Exp. Then. 172 : 170 - 179, 1970. A hitherto unobserved jumping activity was noted after the administration of subconvulsant doses of sodium 5 -(1, 3 -dimethylbutyl) - 5 -ethyl barbiturate (DMBEB) in young mice. Jumping rarely occurred after injections of saline, depressant barbiturates and central stimulants. The role of the sympathetic nervous system in DMBEB-induced jumping was evaluated. The jumping was accompanied by elevations in body temperature and plasma glucose. Chionisondamine, <b>pempidine,</b> propranolol and phentolamine blocked the hyperglycemia induced by DMBEB. d-Ampheta-mine potentiated the jumping activity. Ganglionic blocking drugs (chlorisondamine and <b>pempidine)</b> and beta adrenergic blocking agents (propranolol and K#{ 246 } 592) reduced or abolished this jumping without lowering brain levels of DMBEB. Except in high doses, the benzodiazepine anticonvulsants were ineffective. These findings suggest an important role of the sympathetic nervous system in DMBEB-induced jumping.

40|$|The contractions of the {{guinea-pig}} isolated {{vas deferens}} elicited by electrical {{stimulation of the}} hypogastric nerve were completely blocked by the following drugs: guanethidine, bretylium, dimethylphenylpiperazinium hydrochloride, nicotine, <b>pempidine,</b> hexamethonium, hemicholinium, D-tubocurarine and procaine. However, when the vas deferens was stimulated through an electrode in its lumen, the contractions in response to frequent, short stimuli (50 shocks/sec, 1 msec duration) were blocked by guanethidine, bretylium and dimethylphenylpiperazinium, but were not affected by the remaining drugs, except that procaine and hemicholinium each caused some reduction in the responses. When the preparation was stimulated transmurally with shocks of 200 msec duration at 1 shock/sec, the contractions were unaffected {{by any of the}} above drugs, except hemicholinium which again caused a slow reduction of up to 50 % of the original response. It is concluded that nicotine, <b>pempidine,</b> hexamethonium, D-tubocurarine and hemicholinium probably block the response to stimulation of the hypogastric nerve by acting on peripheral ganglia in its pathway. Hemicholinium appears to have an additional effect in depressing the responses of the smooth muscle of the vas deferens to direct electrical stimulation, and procaine may act both on the ganglia and at the nerve terminals...|$|E
40|$|A {{pharmacological}} {{analysis was}} made of the depolarizing acetylcholine (ACh) response found on the gastric mill 1 muscles of the crabs Cancer pagurus, Cancer irroratus and Cancer borealis. Acetylcholine, carbamylcholine, trimethylammonium, nicotine, and dimethyl- 4 -phenyl-piperazinium were effective in producing contractures and depolarizations in these muscles. No response to decamethonium, suberyldicholine, acetyl-/?-methylcholine, carbamyl-^-methylcholine, pilo-carpine and oxotremorine could be detected. High concentrations of muscarinic agonists (io~ 4 to io~ 3 M) potentiated and prolonged the ACh iontophoretic response. When the acetylcholinest-erase activity was inhibited with neostigmine, or when the response was elicited with carbamylcholine, muscarinic agonists partially inhibited the response. ACh responses were most effectively blocked by vertebrate nicotinic ganglionic antagonists, including dihydro-/?-erythroidine, <b>pempidine,</b> and mecamylamine. a-Bungarotoxin was without effect on the ACh response...|$|E

Ganglionic blocking drugs (hexamethonium and <b>pempidine),</b> applied to auricles which had been previously treated with reserpine, abolished the diphasic effect of nicotine, but did not alter the response to histamine. Dichloroisoproterenol did not modify the stimulant action of histamine in isolated auricles, either before or after treatment with reserpine; nor did it alter {{the response of the}} isolated heart. Diphenhydramine reduced or blocked the stimulant action of histamine in auricles which had been previously treated with reserpine.

40|$|The anticurare {{activity}} of some guanidine derivatives {{has been studied}} using the fowl sciatic nerve-gastrocnemius muscle preparation and the cat sciatic nerve-gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscle preparations. Among the compounds tested, and in decreasing order of potency, were NN-dimethylguanidine, N-methylguanidine, guanidine and N-aminoguanidine which antagonized or prevented tubocurarine or gallamine triethiodide-induced paralysis. None of the derivatives antagonized the effects of suxamethonium or decamethonium. NN-Dimethylguanidine, N-methylguanidine and guanidine antagonized or prevented the curare-like effects of magnesium without altering the {{activity of}} hemicholinium. At high doses NN-dimethylguanidine induced a decamethonium-like spastic paralysis in the fowl sciatic nerve-gastrocnemius muscle preparation. NN-Diethylguanidine, however, induced a tubocurarine-like flaccid paralysis. The derivatives possessing anticurare activity were also studied using the cat superior cervical ganglion-nictitating membrane preparation to check their possible effects against ganglionic blocking agents. Only guanidine antagonized or prevented the effects of hexamethonium, pentolinium and mecamylamine; it {{had no effect on}} the actions of <b>pempidine</b> and chlorisondamine.

40|$|The voltage dependence, {{concentration}} dependence, and agonist {{dependence of}} blocking and unblocking produced by anticholinergic agents on the ionophoretically activated cholinergic currents of the lobster gastric mill 1 (g. m. 1) muscle were examined. Although the ionophoretic technique provides only qualitative {{information as to}} blocking mechanisms it is useful in revealing slow components of the blocking action of some drugs. At least two qualitatively different types of voltage-dependent block of the crustacean cholinergic currents were observed. For <b>pempidine,</b> mecamylamine and decamethonium (also chlorisondamine: Lingle, 1983), a slowly developing voltage-dependent block was produced {{that led to the}} formation of a stable-blocked state. Recovery from this stable-blocked state is largely dependent on subsequent application of agonist. In contrast, recovery from the voltage-dependent block produced by QX- 222, atropine, procaine and curare either proceeds independently of agonist application or occurs too rapidly to be observed by the present methods. Blockade by hexamethonium reveals anomalous voltage dependence, being enhanced over some voltages and relieved with additional hyperpolarization. Blockade by trimetaphan is largely independent of membrane potential except at higher concentrations...|$|E
40|$|The 5 -nitrothiazole, nitazoxanide, {{is a novel}} {{compound}} with a {{broad spectrum}} of activity; effective against anaerobic/microaerophilic intestinal protozoa and bacteria. The mechanism of nitazoxanide's anthelmintic activity is unknown. This study examined the mode of action of nitazoxanide and analogues against nematodes, trematodes and cestodes. Caenorhabditis elegans, a free living nematode, was used as a model. Nitazoxanide was found to exert a transient spastic paralytic effect, particularly at the posterior end of the nematode, with 50 % effect at 4. 62 µM.

40|$|Acetylcholine, in the {{presence}} of atropine, has an action like that of sympathetic stimulation. When injected into the splenic artery it causes contraction of the spleen, but this action is blocked by hexamethonium; stimulation of the splenic nerves, however, is still effective. Thus hexamethonium distinguishes between sympathetic nerve stimulation and the action of acetylcholine. If bretylium is used instead of hexamethonium, there is no such distinction, for bretylium blocks the response to nerve stimulation as well as that to acetylcholine. It appeared that hexamethonium might block the action of acetylcholine by preventing its entry into the sympathetic fibre. Acetylcholine has some structural similarity to bretylium, since acetylcholine is a derivative of trimethylammonium and bretylium is a derivative of dimethylethylammonium. It has been found that hexamethonium, pentolinium and hemicholinium (HC- 3), which are all bis-quaternary compounds, block the action of bretylium, presumably by preventing its entry into the fibre. Consistent with the view that ability to enter the fibre is important is the observation that mecamylamine and <b>pempidine,</b> which are ganglion-blocking agents, but not either mono- or bis-quaternary compounds, often abolish the response to stimulation of the sympathetic postganglionic fibre...|$|E
40|$|By {{use of a}} {{sensitive}} in vitro microsuperfusion method, the cholinergic prsynaptic control of dopamine release was investigated in a prominent striosome (areas poor in acetylcholinesterase activity) located within the core of cat caudate nucleus and also in adjacent matrix area. The spontaneous release of [3 H]dopamine continuously synthesized from [3 H]tyrosine in the matrix area {{was found to be}} twice that in the striosomal area; the spontaneous and potassium-evoked releases of [3 H]dopamine were calcium-dependent in both compartments. With 10 (- 6) M tetrodotoxin, 5 x 10 (- 5) M acetylcholine stimulated [3 H]dopamine release in both striosomal and matrix areas, effects completely antagonized by atropine (10 (- 6) M), thus showing the involvement of muscarinic receptors located on dopaminergic nerve terminals. Experiments without tetrodotoxin revealed a more complex regulation of dopamine release in the matrix: (i) In contrast to results seen in the striosome, acetylcholine induced only a transient stimulatory effect on matrix dopamine release. (ii) Although 10 (- 6) M atropine completely abolished the cholinergic stimulatory effect on [3 H]dopamine release in striosomal area, delayed and prolonged stimulation of [3 H]dopamine release was seen with atropine in the matrix. The latter effect was completely abolished by the nicotinic antagonist <b>pempidine</b> (10 (- 5) M). Therefore, in the matrix, in addition to its direct (tetrodotoxin-insensitive) facilitatory action on [3 H]dopamine release, acetylcholine exerts two indirect (tetrodotoxin-sensitive) opposing effects: an inhibition and a stimulation of [3 H]dopamine release mediated by muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} muscarine, {{atropine}} and nicotinic antagonists on the light-evoked release of radioactivity from rabbit retinas previously exposed to [3 H]choline (Ch) was studied. On {{the basis of}} previous experiments, this light-evoked release of total radioactivity was taken {{as a measure of}} the light-evoked release of [3 H]acetylcholine (ACh) from the cholinergic amacrine cells. Atropine (1 microM) in the presence, but not the absence, of eserine more than doubled the light-evoked release of [3 H]ACh. Eserine (30 microM) itself had no significant effect on either the spontaneous resting release or the light-evoked release of [3 H]ACh. Muscarine (10 microM) in {{the presence or absence of}} eserine reduced the light-evoked release of [3 H]ACh from the retina by 50 %. This effect of muscarine was blocked by atropine used in the absence of eserine. The nicotinic antagonists <b>pempidine,</b> hexamethonium and gallamine had no significant effect on retinal [3 H]ACh release. Strychnine (20 microM), which alone had no effect on retinal [3 H]ACh release, abolished the effects of both muscarine and atropine on the light-evoked release of [3 H]ACh. Bicuculline (5 microM) did not affect the actions of muscarine or atropine on the light-evoked release of [3 H]ACh. Previous experiments had shown that glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) reduce the light-evoked release of [3 H]ACh from the retina and that these inhibitory effects are selectively blocked by strychnine (20 microM) and bicuculline (5 microM) respectively. These results suggest the presence in the retina of a cholinergic inhibitory feed-back mechanism which involves a neuronal loop, rather than presynaptic or post-synaptic inhibitory muscarinic receptors on the cholinergic amacrine cells themselves. Our experiments do not provide evidence on the nature of the proposed inhibitory loop, except that it apparently includes a glycinergic or taurinergic (amacrine) cell...|$|E
40|$|Dose/response {{measurements}} {{were made on}} the guinea-pig isolated ileum with six agonists, acetylcholine, 5 -hydroxytryptamine, nicotine, dimethylphenylpiperazinium, choline phenyl ether and histamine. The dose effects were repeated {{in the presence of}} each of twelve antagonists and one anticholinesterase. Acetylcholine and histamine were chosen because of their direct mode of action on smooth muscle, nicotine, dimethylphenylpiperazinium and choline phenyl ether were used as examples of drugs that act at the ganglionic acetylcholine receptor. 5 -Hydroxytryptamine was the drug investigated. Hyoscine blocked the contractions caused by acetylcholine, 5 -hydroxytryptamine and the ganglion-stimulants but left the responses to histamine unchanged. The anticholinesterase N,N'-diisopropylphosphorodiamidic fluoride (mipafox) potentiated all the agonists except histamine. The strength of potentiation decreased in the order 5 -hydroxytryptamine, nicotine, dimethylphenylpiperazinium and choline phenyl ether, and acetylcholine. The local anaesthetic procaine inhibited to the same extent contractions elicited by 5 -hydroxytryptamine, nicotine, dimethylphenylpiperazinium and choline phenyl ether. These results showed that 5 -hydroxytryptamine, like nicotine, choline phenyl ether and dimethylphenylpiperazinium, mediated its response through the nervous plexus. Of those tested 5 -hydroxytryptamine was the only specific antagonist to 5 -hydroxytryptamine; lysergic acid derivatives produced spasm and prolonged changes in tone; phenoxybenzamine caused non-specific block. The diverse modes of action of a number of ganglion-blocking agents were selectively used. Thus hexamethonium, pentolinium, and nicotine in its competitive phase, blocked contractions due to nicotine, dimethylphenylpiperazinium and choline phenyl ether and left those due to 5 -hydroxytryptamine, acetylcholine and histamine unchanged. The depolarizing ganglion-blocking agents, dimethylphenylpiperazinium and nicotine, inhibited the responses to all the indirectly acting drugs. Furthermore, mecamylamine, a drug with a less well-defined mode of action, partially inhibited contractions due to 5 -hydroxytryptamine in a concentration that blocked those due to nicotine, dimethylphenylpiperazinium and choline phenyl ether. <b>Pempidine,</b> known to act like mecamylamine, did not antagonize 5 -hydroxytryptamine. It is concluded that 5 -hydroxytryptamine activates specific receptors sited at the intramural parasympathetic ganglion cells...|$|E

Cestodes and trematodes in vitro showed high sensitivity to nitazoxanide with <µM causing rapid paralysis and tegumental damage in Hymenolepis diminuta and Schistosoma mansoni. This was accompanied by inhibition of α-bungarotoxin binding to nicotinic receptors in S. mansoni, further suggesting an effect on neurotransmission. Uptake of glucose by the schistosome was decreased, and tegumental damage was found, suggesting that nitazoxanide can impair worm nutrition. Analysis of physicochemical properties of nitazoxanide suggested it is a protonophoric uncoupler. Consistent with this, synthesis of ATP was inhibited significantly by 33 µM nitazoxanide in C. elegans and S. mansoni. In mitochondria of H. diminuta an increase in oxygen uptake was observed comparable to that seen with known protonophores suggesting that uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation was occurring. In conclusion, nitazoxanide is likely to affect helminths by a direct effect on neurotransmission and protonophoric uncoupling. Nematodes are less sensitive than trematodes and cestodes in vitro, possibly due to difficulty of drug adsorption through the cuticle. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
