5|$|The station's {{parking lot}} {{has had a}} valet service since the station {{overhaul}} in 2007. The ongoing construction took up parking spaces, which spurred the village government to institute valet parking. The parking service has remained since the construction finished. A private contractor has {{an agreement with the}} village for three employees to manage that part of the lot. An additional section of the station <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>is</b> privately owned. The valet service has no extra charge.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{all other}} {{stations}} {{on the line}} from Lincoln west, Ayer has no dedicated station parking, despite serving over 400 passengers per day. The lots adjacent to the station are privately owned and serve local businesses, but are often illegally used by commuters using the station. The 30-space Nashua River Rail Trail <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>is</b> available for commuters on weekdays; some commuters also use street parking and other business lots. In 2003, the town and the Montachusett Regional Transit Authority (MART) began planning how to increase parking capacity. Five studies in six years concluded with plans for an $11 million, 400-space garage off Park Street, accessibility improvements to the station, and streetscape improvements for pedestrian access. The plans were reduced in scale due to traffic concerns and other issues. $3.2 million in FTA funds (originally intended for expanded parking at Littleton/Route 495 but later rejected) was committed to build a $4 million surface lot. However, the lot was delayed due to conflicts with businesses that would be displaced and the lack of a publicly owned pedestrian entrance (a requirement to use the federal funds).|$|E

50|$|The small <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> {{not large}} enough to {{accommodate}} all the visitors, so an overflow <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> built. Though the beach has a relatively safe lagoon, very strong currents have been reported at the bay, especially in the winter. Amenities at the park include pay phones, picnic tables, restrooms and outdoor showers.|$|R
50|$|Some bus routes are {{available}} from train stations (Muikamachi, Urasa or Koide) to the starting points. However, they are much less convenient than by car and taxi. At the starting points, several dozens of <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> <b>are</b> available for free, but during the best season, the <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> <b>are</b> quickly inundated {{with a lot of}} cars.|$|R

25|$|The {{ballpark}} {{was built}} in the Southeastern Atlanta neighborhood of Summerhill. {{across the street from the}} former home of the Braves, Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, which was demolished in the summer of 1997 and replaced with a parking lot. The <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>is</b> painted with the field location and configuration of the old ballpark. The section of the outfield wall with the monument marking where Hank Aaron's 715th home run went over it was reinstalled in its original location, and still stands today. From 2002 to 2004, the failed Fanplex entertainment center was located adjacent to the stadium's parking lot. The stadium contained 5,372 club seats, 64 luxury suites, and three party suites.|$|E

50|$|A new <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> {{opened in}} 2001 and added more than 170 spots, {{doubling}} the commuter parking {{available at the}} station. City officials had hoped that expansion would attract more traffic {{to the train station}} and bring commercial development to the nearby downtown area. The second <b>lot</b> <b>is</b> located east of the first lot, and started to provide daily parking at $1 per day. The original <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>was</b> changed to permit parking only.|$|R
25|$|The {{building}} {{consists of}} a single large nave mostly constructed of metal. Inside, {{there are a number}} of narrow aisles containing stalls owned or rented by individual merchants. Most merchants are grouped by the type of merchandise they sell, such as party supplies, dishes, and pets. What little <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>is</b> left is filled by street vendors. On Saturday, when the market is busiest, these vendors overflow from the parking lot onto the surrounding narrow streets. These and various trucks and other vehicles block traffic, effectively closing the streets. The scene is noisy, filled with shouts of vendors and music blaring from stands selling CDs. However, this is also the time to find the widest variety of merchandise, such as nopal cactus and fresh corn from Milpa Alta, flower pots and soil from Xochimilco, and medicinal herbs from Puebla, Morelos and the State of Mexico.|$|E

500|$|The station's layout is of a {{large extent}} {{a piece of the}} village itself. Unlike most train stations, where the <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>is</b> near the station itself, Sloatsburg's lot is near the locally-named Hardware store on Mills Street. [...] This parking lot has 80 parking spaces, most of which is to handle commuters. [...] There are no meters for use of the parking lot, but riding is only free on weekends. [...] The station has one ticket machine for {{travelers}} to use. It accepts debit cards, cash, and credit cards. [...] The station is operated by the village of Sloatsburg instead of Metro-North.
