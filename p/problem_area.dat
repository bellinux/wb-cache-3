5|$|In January 1947, the 6th Airborne Division {{was moved}} to {{northern}} Palestine, swapping locations with the 1st Infantry Division. The 3rd Parachute Brigade took over responsibility for Haifa, which was considered a <b>problem</b> <b>area.</b> The brigade had to guard the docks and port of Haifa, which were the main entry point for immigrants arriving in the country. In addition, the many oil pipelines and installations in the region were a potential target for sabotage. The brigade's first operation was imposing a curfew on the Jewish quarter after the kidnapping of two Britons {{in retaliation for the}} death sentence imposed on Dov Gruner. The next major operation was in July, when an indefinite night time curfew was imposed, in response to several attacks in and around the city. The curfew lasted {{until the end of the}} month.|$|E

The {{analysis}} involves the examination of three <b>problem</b> <b>areas</b> in the Equal Employment Opportunity Program. The <b>problem</b> <b>areas</b> are identified as a lack of resources, a lack of personnel, and a lack of enthusiasm among employees for the program. The evaluation of these <b>problem</b> <b>areas</b> gives insight to the support obtained from management. Recommendations for improving these <b>problem</b> <b>areas</b> follow the analysis...|$|R

40|$|Aim: 1. to {{determine}} the different combinations of <b>problem</b> <b>areas</b> in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and/or knee; 2. {{to determine}} whether these <b>problem</b> <b>areas</b> are comparable with those described in the Dutch Osteoarthritis Guideline for physiotherapists, and 3. to investigate {{the relation between the}} most common combinations of <b>problem</b> <b>areas</b> and the interventions applied. Methods: in this descriptive study, primary care physiotherapists (n= 26) recorded combinations of <b>problem</b> <b>areas</b> and the interventions applied to 97 patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and/or knee (A C R criteria). Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate which combinations of <b>problem</b> <b>areas</b> were recorded and which interventions were applied. Chi square statistics were used to investigate whether common combinations of <b>problem</b> <b>areas</b> were associated with the intervention applied. The relative risk was calculated if the association was significant. Results: physiotherapist recorded 15 different combinations of <b>problem</b> <b>areas</b> (patient profiles), the most common being 'disorders of movement (98 %), and 'pain' (84 %). These different patient profiles could be distinguished by {{the presence or absence of}} certain problems, such as 'active inflammatory impairments', 'participation problems, and 'inadequate pain behaviour'. The most commonly applied interventions were 'exercise therapy to support physical functions' (81 %), 'exercise therapy to support activities'(74 %), and 'information and advice' (56 %). The choice of therapy differed for <b>problem</b> <b>areas</b> involving 'inadequate pain behaviour' or 'active inflammatory impairments'. Conclusion: The choice of physiotherapy intervention for osteoarthritis of the hip and/or knee depends in part on the combination of <b>problem</b> <b>areas</b> involved. While the most commonly used interventions were largely consistent with the literature and the recommendations of the Dutch Osteoarthritis Guideline, the occurrence of specific patient profiles in daily practice was not entirely consistent with that described in the Guideline.

25|$|Gridded Methods like finite {{difference}} and finite element methods solve the groundwater flow equation by breaking the <b>problem</b> <b>area</b> (domain) into many small elements (squares, rectangles, triangles, blocks, tetrahedra, etc.) and solving the flow equation for each element (all material properties are assumed constant or possibly linearly variable within an element), then linking {{together all the}} elements using conservation of mass across the boundaries between the elements (similar to the divergence theorem). This results in a system which overall approximates the groundwater flow equation, but exactly matches the boundary conditions (the head or flux is specified in the elements which intersect the boundaries).|$|E
25|$|Shortly after St Niklaus station, {{the next}} rack section starts. This leads {{up to the}} Blattbachtunnel, a 130 metre long {{avalanche}} protection structure erected in 1931. The original uncovered stretch of line at this point had to be abandoned, as the railway bridge over the Blattbach had been destroyed many times by avalanches and flooding since it was first constructed.

At the same time, and by the same means, the exit of the third rack rail section could be protected from bad weather.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study on}} the intercultural communicative experiences of French and English expats, located in the Netherlands. The research aims to answer the following question: “To what extent is it possible to identify mutual and culture-specific <b>problem</b> <b>areas,</b> for French and English expats, located in the Netherlands, with regards to their intercultural communicative experience with the Dutch?” Through content analyses of in-depth interviews with the before mentioned groups, an inventory has been made of <b>problem</b> <b>areas</b> with regards to the intercultural communication with the Dutch. These <b>problem</b> <b>areas</b> have been analysed using an analyses model which is based on the Linguistic Awareness of Cultures (LAC) model by Müller-Jacquier (2004). The <b>problem</b> <b>areas</b> of both groups were compared in order to identify which <b>problem</b> <b>areas</b> were mutual and which culture-specific with regards to their intercultural communication with the Dutch. The research shows that both mutual as well as culture-specific <b>problem</b> <b>areas</b> can be identified for the interviewed French and English expats. Based on {{the results of this study}} I would like to recommend future studies to examine the possibilities for a new format of intercultural communication training, for French and English expats being dispatched to the Netherlands...|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} sets of competencies for different specializations within I/O psychology and I/O psychologists are versatile behavioral scientists. For example, an I/O psychologist specializing in selection and recruiting should have expertise in finding the best talent for the organization and getting everyone on board while {{he or she might}} not need to know much about executive coaching. Some I/O psychologists specialize in specific areas of consulting whereas others tend to generalize their areas of expertise. There are basic skills and knowledge an individual needs in order to be an effective I/O psychologist, which include being an independent learner, interpersonal skills (e.g., listening skills), and general consultation skills (e.g., skills and knowledge in the <b>problem</b> <b>area).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{consensus}} {{of most of}} the investigating commissions was that the initial break took place at or near the fault line, which had been a <b>problem</b> <b>area</b> since water first covered the area, on the western abutment. The prevailing thought was that increasing water percolation through the fault line had either undermined or weakened the foundation to a point that a portion of the structure blew out or the dam collapsed from its own immense weight. This agreement among them was also due, in conjunction, with a chart which was made by the automatic water level recorder located on the dam’s center section. This chart clearly showed that there had been no significant change in the reservoir level until forty minutes before the dam’s failure when, during that forty minutes, a small though gradually increasing amount of loss was recorded.|$|E

2500|$|Pittsburgh {{defensive}} end Hugh Green {{was a surprise}} selection, as the Buccaneers were considered to need help in the secondary, and were expected to pick either USC safety Ronnie Lott or UCLA safety Kenny Easley (who had already been taken by the Seattle Seahawks {{by the time of}} Tampa Bay's selection). Green's Pittsburgh team produced eight NFL starters, believed to be the most by far from any single college team. By contrast, the Georgia team that finished ahead of them in the national championship race produced only two NFL players, neither of them a starter. Personnel director Ken Herock described Green as [...] "dominating...a heavy hitter...an impact player" [...] and said that there was no choice but to draft him. Scouting services described him as a 220-lb linebacker with the lateral movement of a 180-lb cornerback. It was doubly surprising that, considering their fondness for ex-USC players, the Buccaneers would pass over Lott to select a player at a position at which they already were so deeply stocked with talent. However, the staff did not deliberate long before calling his name, and soon felt him worthy of Rookie of the Year honors. With no premier defensive backs available in the second round, and with running back having been identified by the coaching staff as a <b>problem</b> <b>area</b> of the team, they selected Missouri running back James Wilder. Wilder's selection and subsequent training camp performance made starting fullback Johnny Davis expendable, and he was traded to San Francisco for James Owens. With their middle-round picks traded away, West Texas A cornerback John Holt became the Buccaneers' last selection of {{the first day of the}} draft. When McKay saw cornerbacks Holt and Johnny Ray Smith return punts, he immediately cut original Buccaneer Danny Reece, who had handled nearly every punt return in the team's first five years. Reece, who had set a league record by calling for fair catches only twice in the previous two seasons, had fallen out of favor due to several fumbles during the previous season, and never had the speed expected of a return man. Smith did make the team, but was immediately placed on injured reserve. Eighth-round pick Denver Johnson left camp unexpectedly shortly before the first preseason game, despite strong prospects of making the squad. It was later revealed that he had been accepted to law school, and chose that over a football career.|$|E
