40|$|In this study, student {{assessment}} experiences {{related to}} practice education are explored {{in the context}} of two pre-registration physiotherapy courses (BSc and MSc), at the University of Brighton. The notion of student assessment, in the sense it is being used in the study, refers to student assessment processes related to a fixed period of education within a professional practice setting, {{as an integral part of}} the higher educational process and course curriculum. Qualitative data of students lived experiences were obtained after their practice placements, based on individual, face-to-face interviews, and in-depth interview techniques.

It provides an opportunity within a safe, supportive environment to practice nursing skills. Although simulation has been proven to be an effective strategy for both learning and teaching within nursing, simulated models do not provide an opportunity for nursing students to develop and refine communication skills and thus does not adequately prepare them for the context of the nurse/patient relationship. At The University of the Sunshine Coast, standardized patients have been recruited to assist in clinical lab for year one and two students enrolled in The Bachelor of Nursing Science. The University of the Sunshine Coast have people enrolled in University of the Third Age (U 3 A) defined as ‘‘learning partners over 50 years of age who are committed to engaging in a higher level of education’’.

40|$|Objectives This {{exploratory}} evaluation {{sought to}} examine students' experiences of receiving lectures via a web-based digital lecture technology, Lecture Capture. Design A descriptive, online survey undertaken during weeks 8 - 10 of semester one in May, 2010. Setting An Australian University in Brisbane, South-East Queensland. Subjects 128 first-year {{students enrolled in}} a Bachelor of Nursing Program. Main outcome measure Student experiences of Lecture Capture measured by a 14 -item survey developed for the evaluation. Results Students largely perceived Lecture Capture to be useful in aiding understanding and learning, both during the course and in <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>assessment.</b> It particularly helped the two older groups of students (22 - 30 & > 30 years) understand lectures and revise content at their own pace. Lecture Capture assisted first-year students in adjusting to university life, and this was most noticeable for the youngest group of respondents (< 19 years). On-line lectures helped students {{become familiar with the}} program's websites and web resources and provided an opportunity to practice note-taking. With the exception of those aged 22 - 30, Lecture Capture was not regarded as a more effective use of time than face-to-face lectures. Predominantly, students would have preferred face-to-face lectures with optional Lecture Capture, and this was strongest amongst the two older groups. Students overwhelming noted satisfaction when live lectures became available from week four. Conclusions Findings support the use of web-based digital lecture technology during the initial weeks of university for first-year Bachelor of Nursing students, but indicate this should be to supplement, rather than replace, traditional face-to-face lectures.

40|$|M. Comm. The South African {{education}} and training system has for many years been fragmented and unfair towards underprivileged population groups. Since 1994, many changes have been initiated via legislation to ensure a unified and equal national system of {{education and}} training. Higher education has not been excluded from this and is undergoing major changes. These changes are mainly driven by current higher education legislation together with the regulations of the South African Qualifications Authority towards establishing a National Qualifications Framework (NQF). Higher education transformation is built around three central features, namely increased participation, greater responsiveness, and increased cooperation and partnerships. One {{of the ways in}} which participation and responsiveness can be achieved is through Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). Formal RPL has not yet been implemented in higher education institutions, although informal forms of RPL have taken place. In an attempt to understand RPL, the approaches to prior learning recognition in various countries are analysed. Aspects such as the forms of RPL, sources, objectives and uses, benefits and advantages are extrapolated from current sources. A table with a summary per country is provided as a future reference guide. A Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) process model is synthesised after analysis of prior learning recognition process models in different countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada and Australia. This model serves as suggested process model for Recognition of Prior Learning in higher education institutions in South Africa. The model consists of ten stages, namely pre-entry, initial contact, learning identification, <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>assessment,</b> assessment, verification, accreditation and certification, appeals, recording and post-RPL counselling.

40|$|In {{recent years}} Australian Law Schools have {{implemented}} {{various forms of}} peer assisted learning or mentoring, including career mentoring by former students of final year students and orientation mentoring or tutoring by later year students of incoming first year students. The focus of these programs therefore is on the transition into or out of law school. There is not always as great an emphasis however, {{as part of this}} transition, on the use of law students belonging to the same unit cohort as a learning resource for each other within their degree. This is despite the claimed preference of Generation Y students for collaborative learning environments, authentic learning experiences and the development of marketable workplace skills. In the workplace, be it professional legal practice or otherwise, colleagues rely heavily on each other for information, support and guidance. In the undergraduate law degree at the Queensland University of Technology (‘QUT’) the Torts Student Peer Mentor Program aims to supplement a student’s understanding of the substantive law of torts with the development of life-long skills. As such it has the primary objective, albeit through discussion facilitated by more senior students, of encouraging first year students to develop for themselves the skills they need to be successful both as law students and as legal practitioners. Examples of such skills include those relevant to: <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>assessment</b> tasks; group work; problem solving, cognition and critical thinking; independent learning; and communication. Significantly, in this way, not only do the mentees benefit from involvement in the program, but the peer mentors, or program facilitators, themselves also benefit from their participation in the real world learning environment the program provides. This paper outlines {{the development and implementation of}} the above program, the pedagogy which influenced it, and its impact on student learning experiences...|$|E

The area is located {{at an altitude of}} 246  m with the long-term mean precipitation of 500  mm and the mean annual temperature of 8. 4  °C. The soils are classified as Chernozem, moderately heavy, loamy, with a good supply of nutrients, humus content of 2. 30  % and an alkaline soil reaction. Slope gradient is 12  %, exposition is NE. To study the role of intercrops in erosion control, three variants were established after the harvest of the main crop, two variants with different intercrops and one (control) with no intercrop. These were Variant 1 with Secale cereale L. var. multicaule METZG. ex ALEF., a non-freezing intercrop, Variant 2 with cluster mallow (Malva verticillata L.), a freezing intercrop, and a control variant with no intercrop. In Variant 1 Secale cereale L. var. multicaule was desiccated with the herbicide Roundup in early spring. All the variants involved maize as the main crop.

40|$|Learning {{clinical}} skills {{presents a}} novel experience for undergraduate students, {{particularly when it}} comes to preparing for skill assessment. Compared with the thousands of hours of practice believed to be necessary for the development of motor skill expertise (1), these students have significantly limited exposure time. Furthermore, effective clinicians combine procedural skills expertise with the flexibility required to implement these in the real-world environment in which clients and situations can change. Therefore, unlike the learning of theory (such as solving a physics problem), rote learning and repetition may not maximize learning outcomes for the development of new clinical skills. There is a substantial body of research that shows that conception of learning influences the learning outcomes in university students, and much of this research has been conducted in undergraduate science cohorts (3, 5, 6, 9, 11). For instance, when first-year physics students approached learning with a focus on understanding (a deep conception and approach), their learning outcomes were superior to those who intended to merely complete the task requirements and associated learning with memorization and reproduction (a surface conception and approach) (4). Yet it is unclear whether conception of learning influences outcomes for clinical skill development. Conception of learning varies with the academic task (7), and it could be argued that, unlike theory-focused learning (e. g., physics), a deep conception and approach may not lead to superior learning of hands-on clinical skills. Arguably, a conception of learning that emphasizes memorization and procedural skill reproduction (characteristics of surface learning) may be ideal for undergraduate students preparing for clinical skill assessment, particularly given the limited preparation time available in the context of a 10 - to 13 -wk unit of study. Students have a tendency to identify for themselves what counts for assessment (or at least what they perceive counts) and orientate their efforts in study in <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>assessment</b> accordingly (2). This pilot study reports the level of clinical skill mastery in undergraduate exercise science students who were learning and being assessed on clinical skills for the first time. In this unit, we provided the students with a variety of learning experiences (delivery modes: videos, face-to-face tutorials, printed handouts, and lectures) from which to prepare for a skills examination that assessed their accuracy of implementing clinical techniques with real human subjects. The purpose of this investigation was to examine whether student performance in the skills assessment was related to their conception of learning, which was inferred from responses to a voluntary survey. To gain some insight into student approaches to the learning of clinical skills and to inform future teaching and learning approaches, we also sought to examine student engagement with the learning material and the possible interaction between clinical skill mastery and conceptions of learning...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background There is an {{apparent}} disjuncture between {{the requirements of}} the medical spiral curriculum and the practice of replacing previous online material in undergraduate courses. This paper investigates the extent to which students revisit previous online material for the purposes of building the educational spiral, and the implications for the implementation of a Faculty's Learning Management System implementation. Methods At the University of Cape Town, medical students' last date of access to 16 previous online courses was determined. Students completed a survey to determine their reasons for revisiting this material and the perceived benefits of this availability. Results 70 % of the students revisited their previous online courses. The major reasons were to review lecture presentations, lectures notes, and quizzes. The perceived benefits were for understanding new material, <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>assessments,</b> and convenience. Although student comments were not always in line with the concept of the spiral curriculum, most referred to processes of building on previous work, and some mentioned the spiral curriculum specifically. Conclusion This study suggests that the practice of replacing previous online courses may hinder rather than support student learning. Although students visit previous material for ranges of reasons, a large number are aware of the spiral curriculum, and use the online environment to build upon previous material. Any practice, which entails replacing material and redesigning curricula content may be detrimental to the students' future learning needs, and such activities may need revision. </p...|$|R

40|$|With {{the onset}} of the new {{assessment}} procedures and regulations requiring GP trainees to have one general practice-based educational supervisor throughout their training programme, there are fears that course organisers and trainers will spend an increasing amount of time conducting assessments and appraisals, and less time teaching trainees, to the detriment of their learning. The new GP curriculum is explicit about the areas in which GP trainees should be proficient. The Learning and Teaching Guide emphasises the importance of reflecting on experience as part of the learning process, and comments on the importance of group work in providing peer support, the shaping of attitudes and <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>assessments.</b> This paper forms a review of the effectiveness of facilitated group work and its role in delivering the new curriculum in a way that complements, supports and is integrated with the teaching that trainers provide and self-directed learning sets. The teaching of the curriculum for general practice within three years is only possible because of the structured teaching that exists within its training programmes, and removal of group work would reduce the time that the GP trainees have for reflective learning by up to a third as well as removing the peer aspect of their learning. Facilitators have an important role to play in maximising the benefits of group work by concentrating on maintaining its safety for the participants and its focus.

40|$|Abstract The {{literature}} suggests that peer assessment contributes {{to the development of}} student learning and promotes ownership of assessment processes. These claims emerge from research conducted primarily in Western contexts. This exploratory paper reports on the per-spectives that a class of Hong Kong primary school students and their teachers have on their engagement with peer assessment. It draws on data collected through extensive interviews and classroom observations from a 2 -year case study. The findings indicate that student per-ceptions about the usefulness of peer assessment follow from their perspectives on quality of peer feedback, peer language proficiency, and the novelty or repetitiveness of its processes. Teachers and students also viewed peer assessment as assuming a wider role in preparing for examinations and future secondary schooling. A key implication is that assessment practices are deeply cultural and, in test-dominated settings, peer assessment may have most potential when explicit links are drawn with <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> summative <b>assessment...</b>|$|R
