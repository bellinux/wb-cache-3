40|$|Studies of <b>plafon</b> {{have been}} made with using bagasse. Studies have been done to know the best {{combination}} of bagasse powder and polyester with composition of variations to 4 : 8 gr, 6 : 8 gr, 8 : 8 gr, 10 : 8 gr, and 12 : 8 gr. The properties of <b>plafon</b> that analyzed to test physical properties such as water absorption, density and mechanical properties including impact test, the tensile test and bending strength test. The {{results show that the}} physical properties (density 1, 41 gr/cm 3 and water absorption 11, 54 %) on the composition of bagasse at 4 gr powder are the best results. The higher levels of bagasse powder water absorption the higher the value, so as lower density uptake. Physical properties test results still complete the standards of ISO 03 - 2105, 1996. From testing the mechanical properties (the tensile test 3058, 6 kPa and bending strength test 17, 01 MPa and impact test 2 kJ/m 2). From all the best specimens test, the composition of 8 : 8 the best mechanical properties, the results of physical properties also still complete the standards of ISO 03 - 2105, 1996, so that the composition of 8 : 8 {{can be used as a}} plafo...|$|E
40|$|The barn owl, Tyto alba javanica (Gmel.); {{is one of}} the {{important}} predator of rats. For controlling the rat population, the predator must retain in the rice ecosystem in which it is supported by continuous availability of its prey and suitable nest. The barn owl does not make its own nest, hence, the suaitable nest are necessary vailable in the ecosystem. The rat population fluctuates and in the certain time it is difficult to find, hence, alternative preys have to be available. The nest type and prey species of the barn owl in the rice-field ecosystem had been survayed in Kendal District, Central Java Province, from October 2003 until March 2004. The area represented the rice-field ecosystem type with various habitats. The prey species were described from analysis of 2. 261 pellets that were collected from 106 nests. The nests were found and distributed in 72 sub-sub district and in 17 subdistricts. Hairs, pulmes, skulls, teeth, obtained from the pellets were identified following the Hafidzi & Naim method (2003). The nest types consisted of building <b>plafon</b> (76, 41 %), trees (20, 75 %) and nest box (2, 84 %). Rats were the predominant prey-species (86, 90 %); consisted of Rattus argentiventer 77, 08 %, Rattus norvegicus 9, 86 %, Rattus rattus diardii 0, 58 %, Bandicota indica 0, 01 % and Rattus tiomanicus 0, 005 %),followed by aves (5, 49 %), insects (3, 98 %), bats (2, 07 %), and others (1, 59 %) i. e. squirrels, gecko, house-lizard, and frogs...|$|E
40|$|Background: Since 1987 PT Askes {{has been}} {{implementing}} the drug USAge guideline {{which is called}} DPHO (Daftar dan <b>Plafon</b> Harga Obat). In order to encourage drug services efficiently and related to medical needs. In addition PT Askes has got benefits in medicine expenses that can lower it up to 40 %. Although it has better guidence as long as implementations without being control continuously the aim of it can be far from hope. Through this study we want to examine how extent the drug USAge in social health insurance. Method: In this paper we used cross-sectional study, using entry data base prescriptions from the entire social health insurance participant related in to the first care outpatient and advanced care outpatient. All of the patients originally based on polyclinics hospital services in RSMH during 2007. All of prescriptions we used as data resources. All these data were observed and analyzed performed in descriptive and tabulation. Results: The result of this study shows that we got 140. 256 pieces of per encounter during 2007 with total cost Rp 10. 657. 075. 126, 00. The average cost per encounter is Rp 75. 983, 00 range from Rp 231, 00 to Rp 5. 151. 227, 00. The average number of drug per encounter is 4, 4 and the percentage drug used of antibiotics is 10, 81 %. Conclusion: This study comes to conclusion that the prescriptions costs in social health insurance outpatient was high enough. It is cost by certain prescriptions, polifarmacy, and diverse drugs USAge in overuse prescribing category such as vitamin neurotropic and drug used in AH 2 receptor blocker like as ranitidin that has been prescribed for alleviating gastrointestinal effect...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Drug Related Problems (DRPs) are {{of major}} concern because of physical, {{psychological}} and economical {{implications for the}} patients and for society. The potential risk factor for DRPs is polypharmacy. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the influence of drug information to the doctors for decreasing drug related problems on cardiovascular patient prescriptions at X pharmacy Jakarta. The method of this study was experimental with two groups pretest and posttest designs. Samples were Health Insurance (Askes) patient prescriptions that diagnose cardiovascular desease, above 40 years old age with two hundreds prescriptions each groups. The intervention to the doctor was a letter about analysis of drug related problems (DRPs) which found at prescriptions. The DRPs's studies were drug interactions, subtherapy doses, supratherapy doses, non <b>Plafon</b> and Price List of PT. Askes's Standard Drugs (DPHO) giving and polypharmacy. The results showed that the amount of drugs in a control group was 6. 45 items, mode 7 items, non DPHO drugs 0. 92 items, the price of one prescription was Rp. 229. 471 andthe cost by the patient was 13. 42 %. The amount of drugs in an intervention group was 6. 06 items, mode 6 items, non DPHO drugs 0. 67 items, the price of one prescription was Rp. 206. 298 and the cost by the patient was 12. 72 %. DRPs found were drug interactions, non DPHO drugs giving and polypharmacy. There were no sub therapy doses and supra therapy doses at prescriptions. The influence of interventions to the doctor for decreasing drug related problems in a drug interactions and polypharmacy were significant, butdecreasing of non DP HO drugs giving was not significant. The number of drugs in oneprescription decreasing lowered price of total drugs.
