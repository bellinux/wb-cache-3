40|$|Computer {{programming}} {{has been}} taught {{in secondary schools}} {{for more than two}} decades. However, little is known about how students learn to program. From the curriculum implementation perspectives, learning style helps address the issue of learner differences, resulting in a shift from a teacher-centred approach to a learner-focused approach. This study aims to investigate the effects of gender and learning styles on computer <b>programming</b> <b>performance.</b> The Gregorc Style Delineator (GSD) was employed to measure learning styles. A test was administered to assess students' <b>programming</b> <b>performance.</b> Two hundred and seventeen secondary school students of age from 14 to 19 participated in this study. Results indicated that no gender differences in <b>programming</b> <b>performance</b> were found after controlling for the effect of student ability. Academic ability had a differential effect on programming knowledge. Sequential learners in general performed better than random learners. These results suggest the importance of the ordering dimension of the GSD in influencing <b>programming</b> <b>performance.</b> Implications of the findings in relation to programming pedagogy are discussed in this paper. © 2008 British Educational Communications and Technology Agency. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|In the 21 st century, the {{ubiquitous}} nature of technology today is evident {{and to a}} large extent, most of us benefit from the modern convenience brought about by technology. Yet to be technology literate, {{it is argued that}} learning to program still plays an important role. One area of research in programming concerns the identification of predictors of programming success. Previous studies have identified a number of predictors. This study examined the effect of a combination of predictors (gender, learning styles, mental models, prior composite academic ability, and medium of instruction) on <b>programming</b> <b>performance.</b> Data were collected anonymously through a website from 131 secondary school students in Hong Kong who opted for computer programming in the Computer and Information Technology curriculum. Partial Least Squares (PLS) modelling was used to test a hypothesized theoretical structural model. All of the five aforementioned variables were either direct or indirect predictors of <b>programming</b> <b>performance</b> and the antecedents accounted for 43. 6 % of the variance in <b>programming</b> <b>performance.</b> While this study shows the influence of learner characteristics such as gender, learning styles, and mental models on <b>programming</b> <b>performance,</b> it highlights the effect that prior composite academic ability and medium of instruction exert on learning outcomes, which is uncommon among studies of similar purpose. These findings have significant implications for policy makers and educators alike. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|On CMP, {{programs}} commonly {{interference with}} each other. But for programs co-running on CMP, serious performance dropdown is not expected. With {{the growth of}} the program’s size, program’s contention for limited shared resources in the system will become increasingly intense, and the resulting impact on system performance will be even more pronounced. How to allocate and share limited shared resources among programs is a very important problem. In this paper we propose a new method to ensure the fairness of <b>program’s</b> <b>performance</b> on CMP. The share resource CPU and memory are included in our study. Meanwhile, the Linux resource management tool Cgroups is used to realize our idea. By the resource we profiled and the tool support, we realize a reasonable resource dividing method to ensure the fairness of <b>program’s</b> <b>performance.</b> The reasonable resource dividing method include three Engine. The experiment result show that making use of the fairness resource dividing method proposed by our paper, compared with operating system scheduling, <b>program’s</b> <b>performance</b> difference can be largely reduced...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between self-regulated learning (SRL) and introductory <b>programming</b> <b>performance.</b> Participants were undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory computer programming module at a third-level (post-high school) institution.

The data gathered was analyzed to determine if a relationship existed between self-regulation and <b>programming</b> <b>performance</b> and investigate if SRL could be used to predict performance on the module. The study found that students who perform well in programming use more metacognitive and resource management strategies than lower performing students. In addition, students who have high levels of intrinsic motivation and task value perform better in programming and use more metacognitive and resource management strategies than students with low levels of intrinsic motivation and task value. Finally, a regression model based on cognitive, metacognitive and resource management strategies was able to account for 45 % of the variance in <b>programming</b> <b>performance</b> results...|$|R
