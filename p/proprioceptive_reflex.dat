40|$|Abstract—This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the functional contribu-tion of reflexes to human motor control during posture mainte-nance. Continuous random force disturbances were applied at the hand while the subjects were instructed to minimize the devia-tion resulting from the force disturbances. The results were ana-lyzed in the frequency domain with frequency response functions (FRFs). Two FRFs were evaluated: 1) the mechanical admittance and 2) the reflexive impedance, expressing the dynamic relation between position and muscle activation (assessed via electromyog-raphy, EMG). The reflexive impedance is a direct measure of the <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflexes.</b> To record all relevant dynamical charac-teristics of the arm, wide bandwidth signals were used as force disturbance. Distributing {{the power of the}} signal over fewer fre-quencies within the bandwidth improved the signal-to-noise-ratio SNR of the EMG recordings, facilitating reliable estimation of the reflexive impedance.

40|$|The {{function}} of the proprioceptor in the crustacean appendage has been reported by Burke (1954). According to him the proprioceptor acts as a movement receptor and a vibration receptor. A series of investigations on the <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflex</b> {{has been done by}} Bush (1962, 1965) on the crab, Carcinus maenas. He proved that this reflex was controlled by a "resistance reflex", analogous to the vertebrate stretch reseptor reflex and to the passive joint movement of the crab appendage (Bush, 1965). It became clear in the crayfish that the passive and active movement of the propodite-dactylopodite joint also elicits a similar "resistance reflex " (Murayama, 1965). But the <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflex</b> of the bender and stretcher muscles of the crayfish propodite has not been reported. It is an attractive problem whether a reflex response similar to that of crab will also be observed in the axons of the stretcher and bender muscles of the crayfish since it is known that the pattern of inhibitory innervation differs considerably in the groups to which the crab and the crayfish belong (Wiersma and Ripley, 1952) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} the study is to examine the muscular {{responses}} of healthy adult subjects to support surface rotations in pitch and roll planes. We used an enhanced experimental approach compared to the traditionally used methods in the previous studies by other researchers where the support surface beneath the subject’s feet randomly perturbed the equilibrium. Instead of a predetermined motion of the support surface that would cause the perturbation of the subject’s equilibrium, we perturbed the equilibrium by a Stewart parallel platform. Mounted on the platform, a force plate was recording the motion of the centre-of-mass projection during the experiment. This setup enabled the subjects to actively control the orientation of the parallel platform by shifting the position of their centre-of-mass during the experiment. Using polar diagrams, we show the responses of four muscle groups during the stretch and <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflex</b> and the muscular responses to the visual stimuli. Compared to the results of the previous studies, muscular activities during the stretch and <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflex</b> are more equally distributed in all directions. Based on the motion of the subjects that we recorded using the motion capture system, we determined whether the muscles were stretching or extending during the responses to the perturbations. We also show the effectiveness of the muscles to compensate the perturbations in different directions...|$|E
40|$|Habituation {{kinetics}} {{were found}} to vary considerably in different polysynaptic pathways of the brain stem in man. The exteroceptive reflex of the digastric muscle habituates markedly, even for stimuli repeated at 1 -min intervals. The second component of the blink reflex habituates for intervals below about 8 sec, but this can largely be prevented by steady voluntary contraction of the muscle. On the other hand the exteroceptive suppressions of the masseter muscle only disclose slight habituation of their late component ES 2 and no habituation of the early component ES 1. This {{does not appear to}} be affected by voluntary activation since the suppressive effects present the same pattern in relaxed masseter muscles tested by <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflex</b> activation. Exteroceptive reflexes and exteroceptive suppressions of similar latencies disclose genuine and important differences in their habituation kinetics. © 1976.

40|$|Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a {{disabling}} syndrome {{associated with}} sensory (e. g., burning pain, allodynia, hyperalgesia), autonomic (e. g., edema, skin color and temperature changes), and motor impairments (e. g., tremor, myoclonus, dystonia). Approximately 25 % {{of the patients}} with CRPS develop fixed dystonia which is characterized by abnormal sustained muscle contractions and abnormal postures. No definitive pathophysiology of CRPS and related dystonia exists. Neurophysiological studies have found evidence of impaired inhibition at the spinal cord and motor cortex. In this thesis, a computational neuromuscular model has been developed to explain the movement disorder fixed dystonia through disturbed <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflexes.</b> To validate the model, methods {{have been developed to}} quantify <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflexes</b> in vivo during postural control of patients with fixed dystonia.

Aberrant muscle force feedback successfully mimicked dystonia in the neuromuscular model while experiments demonstrated involvement of muscle force feedback in fixed dystonia.

40|$|Tremor, {{characterized}} by involuntary and rhythmical movements, {{is the most}} common movement disorder. Tremors can have peripheral and central oscillatory components which properly assessed and separated may improve diagnostics. An MR-safe haptic wrist manipulator enables simultaneous measurement of proprioceptive reflexes (peripheral components) and brain activations (central components) through fMRI. For such a MR-safe manipulator, this study determined the design criteria, created the design and presented its prototype. The prototype is divided into an MR-safe and MR-unsafe part. The hydraulic MR-safe vane motor (end effector) and optical sensors in the MR-environment are connected to the MR-unsafe part in the control room via hydraulic tubes and optical fibers. As a result, the fMRI quality is ensured and the manipulator is suited for safe use in any MR-environment. During a test in an MR-scanner (AMC, Amsterdam) no distortions in the MR-image or sensor signal were observed. The vane motor has a range of motion of 134 ° with a designed torque delivery of 8 Nm at a 3 bar pressure difference. The achieved accuracy for the torque sensor is ± 2 % full scale (F. S. = 14. 3 Nm) and for the absolute position sensor ± 1 % full scale (F. S. = 70 = 1. 22 rad). The prototype vane motor had some leakage along the axis, this prevented the use of pre-pressure and consequently reduced the bandwidth and maximum torque. However the maximum achieved torque of 1. 5 Nm was still enough to met the requirement of 1. 2 Nm. A PI controller was used to control the system, however this controller could not cope with the inherent non-linearities of hydraulics over the intended bandwidth (20 Hz). Despite the fact that the controller was not optimal, typical responses were obtained with impedance FRFs of two inertial loads. For future research it is recommended to remedy the axis leakage and implement a model-based controller. The open-loop FRF of the commanded velocity to the measured vane velocity was determined to characterize the system. Even with leakage and without pre-pressure, the measured bandwidth (- 3 dB) was approximately 5 Hz and the - 180 ° phase is passed at 7 Hz. Although the bandwidth does not fulfill the requirement for <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflex</b> identification it does allow for various motor control experiments. With the recommendations carried out, it is expected that the next prototype will be suited for <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflex</b> identification during fMRI.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} local nonspiking interneurons involved in motor control of legs in the stick insect, Carausius morosus. In a preparation that allowed the animals to perform active leg movements such as adaptive tactile <b>reflexes,</b> <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflexes,</b> and walking, we gathered the following results. Almost all tested nonspiking interneurons that provide synaptic drive onto motoneurons of the proximal leg muscles contribute {{to all of the}} motor programs underlying tactile reflexes and voluntary leg movements such as walking, searching, and rocking. Most of them are also involved in the generation of <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflexes.</b> All motor programs for coactivation, avoidance reflexes, resistance reflexes, and voluntary leg movements result from parallel pathways including nonspiking interneurons that support and others that oppose the motoneuronal activity. The contribution of a single interneuron to the different motor programs is specific: it can be supporting for one motor program but opposing for the other. Even for the same motor program, for example, coactivation, the contribution of an individual interneuron can depend on the stimulus site from where the response is elicited. Our results support the idea that the different motor patterns for adaptive tactile reflexes, resistance reflexes, and voluntary leg movements emerge from a multifunctional neuronal circuit that is reorganized corresponding to the motor behavior performed. The actual motor pattern is then shaped by distributed information processing in parallel supporting and opposing pathways. (C) 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. ...|$|R
40|$|Bilateral coupling, the {{synchronized}} behavior {{between the}} upper limbs {{in time and}} direction, is a well known movement phenomenon for babies. After the age of 11 months, this coupling is largely inhibited so that each limb can be coordinated individually. For stroke patients however, bilateral coupling tends to return. The goal {{of this study is}} to experimentally identify bilateral coupling and quantify the underlying dynamics of the wrist joint. The experiment consist of a tracking task which is performed unimanually and bimanually. Conditions and levels of difficulties are varied within each task to investigate the behavior of bilateral coupling. Fifteen healthy adults and two stroke patients were tested in a setup with two haptic manipulators. MIMO SIPE techniques were used to identify and quantify the underlying dynamics of the wrist joint by fitting the data toA a newly designed bilateral neuromusculoskeletal model. Results showed that cross lateral <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflexes</b> could be identified in both the control group and for the stroke patients. By analyzing the interdependency of the parameters, a linear behavior in the intrinsic stiffness was estimated across the two limbs. A linear behavior implies a bilateral activation of the limbs. For stroke patients, cross lateral <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflexes</b> and bilateral activation of the limbs were dominating during the bimanual condition. These findings are of great importance for rehabilitation techniques. An increased coupled behavior of the limbs could be used either to increase neural activity, or should be suppressed because the paretic limb might influence the healthy limb.

40|$|Background: Complex {{regional}} pain syndrome (CRPS) {{may occur}} after trauma, usually to one limb, and {{is characterized by}} pain and disturbed blood flow, temperature regulation and motor control. Approximately 25 % of cases develop fixed dystonia. Involvement of dysfunctional GABAergic interneurons has been suggested, however the mechanisms that underpin fixed dystonia are still unknown. We hypothesized that dystonia could {{be the result of}} aberrant <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflex</b> strengths of position, velocity or force feedback.

The computer model consists of an antagonistic muscle pair with explicit contributions of the musculotendinous system and reflex pathways originating from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs, with time delays reflective of neural latencies. Three scenarios were simulated with the model: (i) increased reflex sensitivity (increased sensitivity of the agonistic and antagonistic reflex loops); (ii) imbalanced reflex sensitivity (increased sensitivity of the agonistic reflex loop); (iii) imbalanced reflex offset (an offset to the reflex output of the agonistic proprioceptors).

This EPSP is a product of a <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflex</b> arc consisting of two excitatory synapses with a certain subordinate neurone. 4) Later, in the presence of a convulsant, spontaneously conveyed multiple EPSP's were observed on the biopotential of the identified neurone. These multiple EPSP's produced grouped spike discharges or the plateau formation of biopotential of the neurone. 5) The multiple EPSP's may be produced by the grouped spike discharges of the subordinate neurone, the membrane property of which would be changed by a convulsant.

40|$|Background: Patients {{presenting}} with bilateral trigeminal hypoesthesia may {{go on to}} have trigeminal isolated sensory neuropathy, a benign, purely trigeminal neuropathy, or facial-onset sensory motor neuronopathy (FOSMN), {{a malignant}} life-threatening condition. No diagnostic criteria can yet differentiate the two conditions at their onset. Nor is it clear whether the two diseases are distinct entities or share common pathophysiological mechanisms. Methods: Seeking pathophysiological and diagnostic information to distinguish these two conditions at their onset, in this neurophysiological and morphometric study we neurophysiologically assessed function in myelinated and unmyelinated fibres and histologically examined supraorbital nerve biopsy specimens with optic and electron microscopy in 13 consecutive patients with recent onset trigeminal hypoesthesia and pain. Results: The disease course distinctly differed in the 13 patients. During a mean 10 year follow-up whereas in eight patients the disease remained relatively stable, in the other five it progressed to possibly life-threatening motor disturbances and extra-trigeminal spread. From two to six years elapsed between the first sensory symptoms and the onset of motor disorders. In patients with trigeminal isolated sensory neuropathy (TISN) and in those with FOSMN neurophysiological and histological examination documented a neuronopathy manifesting with trigeminal nerve damage selectively affecting myelinated fibres, but sparing the Ia-fibre-mediated <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflex.</b> Conclusions: Although no clinical diagnostic criteria can distinguish the two conditions at onset, neurophysiological and nerve-biopsy findings specify that in both disorders trigeminal nerve damage manifests as a dissociated neuronopathy affecting myelinated and sparing unmyelinated fibres, thus suggesting similar pathophysiological mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|To define {{alterations}} of neuronal connectivity {{that occur}} during motor neuron degeneration, we characterized the function {{and structure of}} spinal circuitry in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) model mice.

Motor neuron loss follows afferent synapse loss with the same temporal and topographical pattern.

To clarify this role, we studied age-dependent modifications of several exteroceptive and <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflexes</b> in five groups of rats conceived, born and reared in hypergravity (2 g). Rats were transferred to normal gravity (I g) at P 5 (post-natal day 5), P 10, P 15, P 21, and P 27. Aspects of neural development and adaptation to I g were assessed until P 40. Hypergravity induced a delay in growth and a retardation {{in the development of}} contact-righting, air-righting, and negative geotaxis. However, we found an advance in eye opening by about 2 - 3 days in HG-P 5 and HG-P 10 rats and an increase in grip-time. No differences were found in tail and grasp reflexes. Our results show that hypergravity leads to a retarded development of motor aspects which are mainly dependent upon the vestibular systern. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Tremor, {{characterized}} by involuntary and rhythmical movements, {{is the most}} common movement disorder. Tremor can have peripheral and central oscillatory components which properly assessed may improve diagnostics. A magnetic resonance (MR) -safe haptic wrist manipulator enables simultaneous measurement of proprioceptive reflexes (peripheral components) and brain activations (central components) through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The presented design for an MR-safe haptic wrist manipulator has electrohydraulic closed-circuit actuation, optical position and force sensing, and consists of exclusively non-conductive and magnetically compatible materials inside the MR-environment (Zone IV). The MR-safe hydraulic actuator, a custom-made plastic vane motor, is connected to the magnetic parts and electronics located in the shielded control room (Zone III) via hydraulic hoses and optical fibers. Deliberate internal leakage provides backdriveability, damping, and circumvents friction. The manipulator is completely MR-safe and therefore operates safely in any MR-environment while ensuring fMRI imaging quality. Undesired external leakage in the actuator prevented the use of prepressure, limiting the control bandwidth. The compact end effector design fits in the MR-scanner, is easily setup, and can be clamped to the MR-scanner bed. This enables use of the manipulator with the subject at the optimal fMRI location and allows it to be setup quickly, saving costly MR-scanner time. The actuation and sensor solutions performed well inside the MR-environment and did not deteriorate image quality, which allows for various motor control experiments. Enabling prepressure by carrying out the recommendations on fabrication and sealing should improve the bandwidth and fulfill the requirements for <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflex</b> identificatio...|$|E
40|$|The muscle spindle in the mammal {{consists}} of several thin striated muscle fibres, the intrafusal fibres, which are innervated by the gamma or fusimotor efferent nerve fibres. There {{are two kinds}} of intrafusal fibres, nuclear bag- which are innervated by larger gamma fibres and nuclear chain-fibres innervated by smaller gamma fibres, the former being longer and thicker than the latter (Barker, 1948; Cooper and Daniel, 1956; Barker and Chin, 1961; Barker and Gidumal, 1961; Boyd, 1962). The afferent input of the <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflex</b> has been studied from the view of its efferent control (Hunt and Kuffler, 1951; Eldred, Granit and Merton, 1953) and the contractile properties of the intrafusal bundle itself have been observed in amphibians (Koketsu and Nishi, 1953; Eyzaguirre, 1957, 1958) and in mammal (Eyzaguirre, 1960). Leksell (1945) could block most of the large motor nerve fibres by pressure or by constant current and found that efferent stimulation caused increased afferent discharges with little or on muscle contraction. Kuffier, Hunt and Quilliam (1951) stimulated small nerve fibres, separated from the large efferents, and also succeeded in increasing the afferent discharges. Basing their work on previous findings of Katz (1949) and using cold-blooded animals, Henatsch and Schulte (1958) reported that Flaxedil and some other endplate blocking agents caused full paralysis of the extrafusal motor endplates at a time when intrafusal neuromuscular transmission was far less influenced. Granit, Homma and Mattews (1958) refer briefly to the same phenomenon in warm-blooded animals. With the transmission of the extrafusal motor endplates blocked in the above-mentioned manner, a stimulation of the ventral roots causes contraction of the intrafusal muscle fibres; therefore, by recording increases of the spindle discharge from a dorsal rootlet, it is possible to study the receptor response under gamma efferent activity...|$|E

Results For the arm, fixed postures were present in 123 arms of 77 patients. The dominant pattern involved flexion of the fingers (116 / 123), the wrists (41 / 123) and elbows (38 / 123). For the leg, fixed postures were present in 114 legs of 77 patients. The dominant pattern was plantar flexion of the toes (55 / 114 legs), plantar flexion and inversion of the ankle (73 / 114) and flexion of the knee (55 / 114). Only the computer simulations of imbalanced reflex sensitivity to muscle force from Golgi tendon organs caused patterns that closely resembled the observed patient characteristics. In parallel experiments using robot manipulators we have shown that patients with dystonia were less able to adapt their force feedback strength.

(2) When a dorsiflexing biasing force {{was applied to the}} foot the amplitude, but not the frequency, of the clonus varied according to the strength of the force. (3) When the biasing force was withdrawn there could be, for some seconds, continuing EMG evidence of a rhythmic dis-charge. (4) The clonus did not synchronise with an externally applied rhythmic force. In all relevant observations beats were set up between the clonus and the applied force. (5) When clonus was started by the abrupt application of bias the waveform in successive trials was fairly closely repeat-able. (6) Beats were also established in two cases of wrist clonus. (7) It is concluded that clonus is not due to the self re-excitation of <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflexes</b> but is dependent on a spinal generator, the rate of beating of which is normally independent of peripheral circumstances, although it may be be switched on and its activity maintained by appropriate events. Clonus is a common neurological sign and one which is at times disturbing to the patient. It has, however, been the subject of very little study. The rhythmic action is usually regarded as th...|$|R
40|$|A basic {{aspect of}} the {{neuronal}} control of quadrupedal locomotion of cat and of bipedal stance and gait of humans concerns the antigravity function of leg extensors. In humans <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflexes</b> involved in the maintenance of body equilibrium depend {{on the presence of}} contact forces opposing gravity. Extensor load receptors are thought to signal changes of the projection of body's centre of mass with respect to the feet. According to observations in the cat, this afferent input probably arises from Golgi tendon organs and represents a newly discovered function of these receptors in the regulation of stance and gait. From these experiments it can be concluded that during locomotion there is a closing of Ib inhibitory and an opening of Ib extensor facilitatory paths. In humans evidence for a significant contribution of load receptor contribution to the leg muscle activation came from immersion experiments. Compensatory leg muscle activation depends on the actual body weight. Also during gait the strength of leg extensor activation during the stance phase is load dependent. In patients with Parkinson's disease there is a reduced load sensitivity and decreased leg extensor activation, which might contribute to the movement disorder. Recent experiments in paraplegic patients show that the beneficial effects of a locomotor training critically depends on the initial degree of body unloading and reloading {{during the course of the}} training period. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{parameters}} of presynaptic inhibition of the Ia spindle afferents from soleus muscle by vibration have been investigated. The inhibitory effects increase with the amplitude of vibration, but decrease when the vibration frequency is increased. The monosynaptic reflex threshold of twenty-one single soleus motor units activated in the H (Hoffman) reflex {{by a single}} electrical stimulus to the posterior tibial nerve was estimated quantitatively and expressed {{in relation to the}} size of the simultaneously recorded H reflex. A parametric study of the effects of various Achilles tendon vibrations on the reflex threshold of the single soleus motor units indicated that their order of de-recruitment is concordant with their rank order for activation in the phasic reflexes of the soleus. The last recruited motoneurones are the most susceptible to being silenced by steady vibration. Muscle vibration progressively recruits single motor units according to the motoneurone size principle through polysynaptic proprioceptive pathways. However the presynaptic inhibition of Ia spindle afferents simultaneously induced by the vibration works in reverse on the same rank order of motoneurones of the soleus spinal pool, thereby limiting the polysynaptic recruitment of units in the tonic vibration reflex while depressing the autogenic phasic <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflexes.</b> These mechanisms elucidate the so-called vibration paradox and extend the size principle of Henneman to presynaptic inhibitory effects.

40|$|AbstractHumans {{control their}} {{movements}} using adaptive proprioceptive feedback from muscle afferents. The interaction between <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflexes</b> and biomechanical {{properties of the}} limb is essential in understanding the etiology of movement disorders. A non-linear neuromuscular model of the wrist incorporating muscle dynamics and neural control was developed to test hypotheses on fixed dystonia. Dystonia entails sustained muscle contractions resulting in abnormal postures. Lack of inhibition is often hypothesized to result in hyperreflexia (exaggerated reflexes), which may cause fixed dystonia. In this study the model-simulated behavior in case of several abnormal reflex settings was compared to the clinical features of dystonia: abnormal posture, sustained muscle contraction, increased stiffness, diminished voluntary control and activity-aggravation. The simulation results were rated to criteria based on characteristic features of dystonia. Three abnormal reflex scenarios were tested: (1) increased reflex sensitivity—increased sensitivity of both the agonistic and antagonistic reflex pathways; (2) imbalanced reflex offset—a static offset to the reflex pathways on the agonistic side only; and (3) imbalanced reflex sensitivity—increased sensitivity of only the agonistic reflex pathways. Increased reflex sensitivity did not fully account for the features of dystonia, despite distinct motor dysfunction, since no abnormal postures occurred. Although imbalanced reflex offset did result in an abnormal posture, it could not satisfy other criteria. Nevertheless, imbalanced reflex sensitivity with unstable force feedback {{in one of the}} antagonists closely resembled all features of dystonia. The developed neuromuscular model is an effective tool to test hypotheses on the underlying pathophysiology of movement disorders...|$|R
40|$|Developmental {{changes may}} affect aimed limb {{movements}} by altering limb mass, muscle strength and musculo-skeletal resistance or changing {{the position of}} a target on the body relative to the responding limb. Scratching movements following stimulation of wings by 5 th instars and adult Schistocerca gregaria were compared before and after the imaginal moult, during which the wings increase in length and rotate, presenting different wing surfaces to external contact. The arrangement of mechanosensory hairs on the wings of 5 th instars and adults was determined and associated with the development of scratching behaviour. The neuronal projections of mechanosensory hairs on the hind wing projected intersegmentally to anterior ventral association centre (aVAC) of the metathoracic ganglion and continued intersegmentally to the mesothoracic aVAC. Scratching movements accommodated developmental changes that occurred between the 5 th instar and adulthood of S. gregaria. There was no change in movement characteristics between 5 th instars and adults, indicating that developmental changes in the muscle strength, limb mass and musculo-skeletal resistance were compensated. Movements were appropriately aimed to accommodate the increase in wing size, and were associated with stimulation of tactile hairs on different wing surfaces in 5 th instars and adults, implying different synaptic connections onto post-synaptic interneurones. Therefore, changes in limb mass, muscle strength and musculo-skeletal resistance due to growth are be compensated for, possible mechanism are <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflexes</b> and dynamic joint stiffness. Changes in target position caused by body growth may be facilitated by the development of new mechanosensory hairs and different synaptic connections onto postsynaptic interneurones. Wing rotation is likely to be accommodated by the intersegmental projections of wing hair afferents, and the convergence of hind wing and fore wing sensory signals.

40|$|The eye allows {{encoding}} {{and receiving}} information about movement: {{it also allows}} knowing the environment, including space and three-dimensional parameters: therefore it {{plays a key role}} in posture. Thus, there is a strong connection between the latter, the visual system and movement. Therefore, the aim of this study was to highlight, through electronic stabilometry in static mode, a correlation, whether or not statistically significant, of any possibility of influencing in an immediate manner the <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflexes</b> that link an athlete's extrinsic eye muscles and posture. Methods The study was conducted on 18 female volleyball athletes. These were subjected to a Lang test of dominant eye and of hypo-convergence. Then to a stabilometric measurement in upright stance with open and closed eyes both in the cabin and in the open field. After that, to exercises of evocation of the convergence reflexes at close range, with the use of a micro-magnet, and from a distance, using a stereo trainer device. We eventually proceeded to a comparison between the stabilometric recordings in the cabin and in the open field. Results There were no statistically significant differences between recordings in the cabin and in the open field. The difference is statistically significant (p<. 001), however, on behalf of the condition in the open field in the length parameter, which indicates a greater stability of athletes. Discussion. The sporting gesture is mostly influenced by the Tonic Postural System, although there are many other factors that contribute to its success. The data confirm that the volleyball athletes are accustomed to an assessment of their surroundings and have a good stability due to the frequent handling of balance or unsteady conditions.

40|$|The {{generation}} of task-dependent and goal-directed walking behaviour requires feedback from leg sense organs for regulating and adapting the ongoing motor activity. Sensory feedback from movement and force sensors influences {{the magnitude and}} the timing of neural activity generated in the neural networks driving individual joints of a leg. In many animals, the effects of sensory feedback on the generated motor output change between posture maintenance and locomotion. These changes can occur as reflex reversals in which sensory information, that usually counteract perturbations in posture control, instead reinforce movements in walking. In stick insects, for example, flexion of the femur-tibia joint {{is measured by the}} femoral chordotonal organ, which mediates reinforcement of the stance phase motor output of the femur-tibia joint when the locomotor system is active. Flexion signals promote flexor and inhibit extensor motoneuron activity. However, the mechanisms underlying these changes are only partially understood. Therefore, {{the purpose of the present}} thesis was to investigate whether the processing of movement and position signals of the FTi joint is task-specifically modified in the {{generation of}} adaptive leg movements, which is required when locomotion is adapted to changes in walking direction or in turning movements. To study the role of these task-dependent changes in walking behaviour on the processing of local sensory signals, the generation of reflex reversals mediated by the femoral chordotonal organ in the femur-tibia joint of the stick insect Carausius morosus was measured in a semi-intact walking preparation. In several experimental conditions either in front, in one or both middle or in hind legs, the femoral chordotonal organ was mechanically displaced and the motoneuronal responses in the flexor and extensor tibia were monitored, while the remaining legs performed either forward, backward or curve walking on a slippery surface. I demonstrated that the occurrence of reflex reversals depends on the specific motor behaviour executed. While in forward walking flexion signals from the front leg fCO regularly elicit reflex reversal in the tibial motoneurons, this cannot be observed in backward walking. Similarly, during optomotor-induced curve walking, reflex reversal occurred reliably in the middle leg on the inside of the turn, however not in the contralateral leg on the outside of the turn. Thus, the experiments revealed that the nervous system modulates <b>proprioceptive</b> <b>reflexes</b> in individual legs during task-specific walking adaptation. Furthermore, I showed that nonspiking interneurons, known to be involved in the premotor network of the FTi joint, participate in reflex responses in both the inner and outer middle leg during curve walking. First results show that the reflex response in some interneuron types is altered between the inner and outer leg, while no differences were found in others...|$|R
