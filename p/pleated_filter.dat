The simulation methods developed in this study are based on first principles and consequently, they do not rely on empirical correction factors. These simulation methods can be used to predict the instantaneous collection efficiency and pressure drop of a filter under dust-loading conditions. In the current study, 3 -D micro- and macroscale CFD models are developed to simulate the service life of flat-sheet and <b>pleated</b> <b>filters.</b> These CFD micro- and macroscale models are also used to quantify the effects of a fiber’s cross-sectional shape on the performance of the resulting filter. As fiber manufacturing methods are rapidly advancing, these fibers are becoming more accessible. The filtration performance of trilobal fibers is compared with their circular counterparts under dust-loading conditions. Our results show that trilobal fibers do not outperform circular ones except in very limited conditions, revealing no advantage over circular fibers. In addition, a fast but approximate 2 -D model is developed to predict the filtration performance of flat and circular <b>pleated</b> <b>filters.</b> The predictions of the model are compared with predictions from the more sophisticated CFD models, as well as with experimental work in the literature.

For flat filters, the results confirm the observations reported by Gupta et al.

For <b>pleated</b> <b>filters</b> as for flat filters, the results reveal that during {{the formation of the}} particulate cake, the increase in relative humidity leads to a decrease in the specific cake resistance. When the reduction in filtration area, specific to <b>pleated</b> <b>filters,</b> becomes large, the presence of humidity accelerates the filling of pleats causing a greater pressure drop for a same aerosol mass loading.

40|$|<b>Pleated</b> <b>filters</b> are broadly {{used for}} various applications. In certain cases, {{especially}} in solid-liquid separation case, the filtering media may get deflected {{and that may}} change the overall performance characteristics of the filter. From the modeling point of view, this is a challenging multiphysics problem, namely {{the interaction of the}} fluid with a so-called poroelastic structure. This work focuses on the development of an algorithm for the simulation of the Fluid Porous Structure Interaction (FPSI) problem in the case of <b>pleated</b> <b>filtering</b> media. The first part of the work is concerned with the development of a robust and accurate numerical method for solving the Stokes-Brinkman system of equations on quadrilateral grids. The mathematical model describes a free fluid flow coupled with a flow in porous media in a domain that contains the filtering media. To discretize the complex computational domain we use quadrilateral boundary fitted grids which resolve porous-fluid interfaces. The Stokes-Brinkman system of equations is discretized here using a sophisticated finite volume method, namely multi-point flux approximation (MPFA) O-method. MPFA is widely used, e. g., in solving scalar elliptic equations with full tensor and highly varying coefficients and/or solving on heterogeneous non-orthogonalgrids. Up to the authors’ knowledge, there was no investigation of MPFA discretization for Stokes-Brinkman problems, and this study aims to fill this gap. Some numerical experiments are presented in order to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed numerical algorithm[1]. The second part of this study focuses on the coupling of the flow model with the deflection of the filtering media. For the consideration of the FPSI problem in 3 D, the classical Biot system describes coupled flow and deformations in a porous body due to difference in the upstream and downstream pressures. Solving the Biot system of equations is complicated and requires a significant amount of computational time. In many <b>pleated</b> industrial <b>filters,</b> the thickness of the filtering media is small compared to the longitudinal dimensions and therefore the porous structure can be modeled as poroelastic plate [2] or poroelastic shell. We use a poroelastic shell model for linear elasticity to resolve the U-shaped <b>pleated</b> <b>filters.</b> Our numerical studies show that in many cases this approach gives accurate results. The so-called weak coupling approach is used to simulate the interaction between the flow and the elasticity problem...|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} is to develop and {{validate}} a computer model for the design of <b>pleated</b> cartridge <b>filters.</b> Mathematical modelling of incompressible creeping flow and low permeability Darcy flow are well established and a number of reliable schemes for the simulation of these regimes are available in the literature. In the context of the present studies a computer model for modelling of combined Stokes/Darcy flows encountered in <b>pleated</b> cartridge <b>filters</b> has been developed. A two-dimensional simulation code that can model fluid hydrodynamics in permeable media as in dead-end <b>pleated</b> cartridge <b>filters</b> has been developed in FORTRAN. The developed code named as ACFAMP- Aircraft Cartridge Filter Analysis Modelling Program has been used to evaluate the performance and design of <b>pleated</b> cartridge <b>filter</b> elements. The governing equations of the flow model can be well represented by the Continuity, Stokes and Darcy equations respectively. Viscosity variations and non-Newtonian effects have been introduced to model the behaviour of shear-thickening fluids used in aircraft hydraulic circuits. The governing equations of the flow model are solved by using a weighted residuals finite element method. Two separate modelling approaches have been adopted in the model development. The first approach is based on modelling of flow through porous media by employing a slightly compressible form of continuity equation utilising nine-noded Lagrangian elements for domain discretisation in conjunction with a U-V -P finite element scheme. The second strategy is based on modelling of coupled Free/Porous regimes making the model industrially complaint. This scheme utilises the stabilised C 0 continuous Taylor-Hood element, which generates stable solutions for incompressible flows without any problems of numerical locking. Initial numerical experiments were based on simple geometries and the complexity of the geometries was finally extended to model the <b>pleated</b> cartridge <b>filters.</b> A permeability model that interprets medium compression effects and which is based on data obtained from flat sheets of the filter material used in the fabrication of the filter cartridge is incorporated within the main model. During pleating, bending and creasing the medium deforms and leads to a loss of permeability and/or effective filtering area results. The combined effects of compression and reduction in filtration area cause deviations from Darcy's law. The effects of medium compression, pleat deformation and pleat crowding have also been analysed.

40|$|International audienceIt is {{currently}} admitted that for each filtration process using pleated filters, {{at least three}} steps can be distinguished: depth and surface filtration, which are common to flat filters, and surface reduction. This step is caused by inefficient filling of the pleat due to the filter geometry. For combustion aerosol, it has been proved that this third step strongly depends on the filtration velocity resulting in an increase of the resistance when air flow decreases.

40|$|In many cases, {{there is}} only limited space inside of the dust cartridge. To {{increase}} the filter surface area, the filter media are pleated to various extents to meet the filtration requirements. In many cases however, one can observe that a pleated medium exhibits a shorter lifetime than one would expect from the corresponding flat sheet media data. One {{of the reasons is}} that the changed flow resistivity of the folding region of the pleat has to be taken care of. The material in the inner part of the fold is compressed while the outer part is stretched. This change in the distribution of the material density directly influences the flow resistivity in the folding region. Eventually, the flow through the entire pleat and the distribution of deposited dirt will be affected, too: The fold ing region is less active than the straight part of the pleat. The aim of the study in this paper is to investigate these effects by analyzing the change of the flow resistance due to the folding of the medium.

In this work, a filter quality factor, which combines the collection efficiency and the pressure drop, is used as the optimization criterion for filter evaluation.

For many years, IRSN is conducting research programs dealing with the impact of a fire on the behaviour of containment devices of radioactive materials such as High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters. It has been already observed, in addition to the well-known regimes of in depth and surface filtration, that for a high deposited mass of nanometrics aerosols (mainly soot particles emitted in case of fire) and low filtration velocity, an additional pressure drop increase occurs for pleated HEPA filters used in the French nuclear industry (Mocho and Ouf 2011). Up to now, little information is available in the literature about this last regime of filtration. The most probable phenomenon is an unbalance in the aerosol repartition along the pleat which causes a reduction of the filtration surface (Del Fabbro et al., 2002). This paper deals with an experimental method to measure the repartition of deposited nanoparticles in the depth of a pleat using embedded samples and electronic microscopy. In this study, HEPA filters were clogged at various controlled filtration velocities on a test bench generating nanoparticles aggregates of Zinc/Aluminium denoting similarities in terms of size and morphology to soot particles emitted in case of fire (Mocho et al., 2011).

A porous-media-flow submodel based on the extended Darcy 2 ̆ 7 s law, as well as experimental techniques of characterizing the porous material, were developed to model the flow through the <b>pleated</b> <b>filter</b> cartridge. ^ In the numerical model, algebraic grid generation method was used to construct the body-fitted-coordinate grid for the filter housing. The fluid dynamics computation {{in this study was}} carried out by using the PHOENICS code, which is based on the finite-volume SIMPLE algorithm for flows in general non-orthogonal coordinate systems. A heavy-duty filter test rig was built, and the overall pressure drop data and static wall pressure distribution were obtained for different flow rates. Compared with the experimental data, the errors of model predictions of overall pressure drop are less than four percent, and the average error of predictions of housing-wall static pressure is from three percent to 10 percent. ^ Numerical experiments were performed for different positions of the inlet pipe and for a range of housing cylinder and outlet pipe sizes. The filter system was subdivided into a number of smaller regions, so that the individual contribution of each region to the overall pressure loss could be evaluated. It is concluded that at higher flow rates the contribution of the filter-housing geometry to the overall pressure drop is much more than that of the filter cartridge. Simple correlations for estimating pressure drop of the heavy-duty filter system are derived from the results of the numerical model experiments.

The {{increasing}} need for clean air in critical industrial applications has highlighted {{the importance of}} the role of air filters in providing improved air quality. Actual performance of air filters installed in air handling units and in the intake of gas turbines tends to deviate from the performance predicted by laboratory results. Therefore, accurate filter performance prediction is important to estimate filter lifetime, and to reduce energy and maintenance operating costs. To ensure that the desired efficiency of a HEPA filter is attained, the effects of face velocity, pleat density and pleat orientation on the Most Penetrating Particle Size (MPPS) of <b>pleated</b> HEPA <b>filters</b> must be examined. This paper compares the effects of varying these parameters on the MPPS.
