2500|$|The site {{shows no}} sign of {{deliberate}} destruction. It appears to have been abandoned and its cultic furniture removed, carried away by the priests. Other Ghassulian sites also display signs of abandonment, and the temple may represent the last phase of the Ghassulian settlements. David Ussishkin has suggested that the Nahal Mishmar hoard, discovered [...] south of Ein Gedi in 1961 by Pessah Bar-Adon, was in fact the temple's cult objects. Containing 429 articles, 416 of which are copper objects including maceheads, sceptres and small crowns, the hoard forms [...] "a unique collection of equipment for use in the Ghassulian ritual" [...] and must have been used in a central sanctuary. It may have been hidden in Nahal Mishmar because of some calamity or approaching danger, never to be recovered. Nevertheless, there does not exist a single find to directly link the hoard to the temple at Ein Gedi. Bar-Adon has suggested some fragmentary ruins near the cave where the hoard was found might have been a comparable cultic location and a <b>possible</b> <b>alternate</b> <b>source.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a survey to determine the prevalence of known and theoretical exposure risks for cryptosporidiosis among selected New York City residents. Subjects were recruited from outpatients attending either a practice for persons with HIV infection (n= 160), or other medical practices (n= 153), at The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. Despite a greater concern for waterborne infection, 82 % of HIV-infected subjects reported consuming municipal tap water compared to 69 % of subjects from other medical clinics (OR 2. 1, 95 % Cl 1. 2 - 3. 6, P= 0. 006). Although 18 % and 31 % of subjects, respectively, denied any tap water consumption at home or work, all but one from each cohort responded positively to having at least one <b>possible</b> <b>alternate</b> <b>source</b> of tap water ingestion such as using tap water to brush teeth or drinking tap water offered in a restaurant. 78 % and 76 % of subjects, respectively, {{had at least one}} potential risk for exposure other than municipal water consumption, such as swimming in pools or contact with animals. Our findings indicate {{that it is possible to}} stratify the population into subsets by the amount of tap water consumed. This suggests that an observational epidemiologic study of the risk of contracting cryptosporidiosis from everyday tap water consumption is feasible...|$|E
40|$|We {{addressed}} {{the need for}} a biomarker of ingestion exposure to drinking water disinfection byproducts by performing a human exposure trial. We evaluated urinary excretion of trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) as an exposure biomarker using 10 volunteers who normally consume their domestic tap water. We recruited the volunteers at a water quality research laboratory in Adelaide, Australia. Participants maintained a detailed consumption and exposure diary over the 5 -week study. We also analyzed tap water and first morning urine (FMU) samples for TCAA, and tap water for chloral hydrate (CH). We documented both interindividual and intraindividual variability in TCAA ingestion and urinary excretion, and both were substantial. With a TCAA-free bottled water intervention, we used creatinine-adjusted urinary TCAA levels to estimate urinary TCAA excretion half-lives for three of the participants. We observed correspondence over time between estimated TCAA excretion, calculated from TCAA + CH ingestion levels, and measured TCAA urinary excretion. This study demonstrates the merits and feasibility of using TCAA in FMU as an exposure biomarker, and reveals remaining concerns about <b>possible</b> <b>alternate</b> <b>sources</b> of TCAA exposure for individuals with low drinking water ingestion exposure.

40|$|Rabbits {{have been}} present in the Sydney {{district}} since well before the Geelong release that provided the genetic stock of rabbits seen throughout most of Australia. In this study a comparison was made between the genetic variation present in, and the endoparasitic communities of, rabbits in the Sydney region and elsewhere in Australia. A genetic variant in the mtDNA control region is common in the Sydney population studied but is not found elsewhere in Australia. The allozyme variants present {{are similar to those}} found in inland NSW, though a rare phosphogluconate dehydrogenase allele is missing from the three high rainfall populations (Sydney, Mogo and Bemboka) studied. While different coat colours are found in rabbits in inland NSW, 'blue' rabbits are not found in Sydney rabbit populations and 'ginger' rabbits are very rare. The suite of ten nematode and protozoan parasite species present in Sydney populations is the same as that found elsewhere in NSW. Six parasitic species found in England are not found in Australia. However, they are also not found in New Zealand, one of the <b>possible</b> <b>alternate</b> <b>sources</b> of Sydney rabbits. The biology of the parasites in the Sydney region is similar to that elsewhere in Australia. It seems likely that rabbit populations in the Sydney area maintain genetic variation derived from both the Geelong release and at least one local release near Sydney. The divergences in the gene pool are minor and {{it is likely that the}} rabbits will not show any significant differences in their ecology from those elsewhere, a result supported by the similarity in the ecology of the parasite suite...|$|R

40|$|Solar {{energy is}} a <b>possible</b> <b>alternate</b> energy <b>source</b> for space heating. A method of {{economic}} long term solar energy storage is needed. Researchers have proposed storing solar energy by heating water using solar collectors and injecting {{the hot water}} into groundwater aquifers for long term energy storage. Of paramount importance {{to the success of}} such a system is the quality and the behavior of the aquifer used for hot water storage. In general, the problem is to obtain an accurate prediction of the response of an aquifer system and its basic components to the operation of a system of injection and pumping wells which are transporting water at a notably different temperature than the natural groundwater. The injection of hot water into a groundwater storage system will have a pronounced effect on the specific storage and mass flow within the aquifer. These effects will result from differences in viscosity, density, specific heat, and thermal conductivity between the injected water and the natural groundwater. A complex system of energy and mass transport will result, making analytical solutions unattainable or very complex. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a numerical simulation which would predict the pressure and temperature of water in a groundwater system at any time in response to the pumping and injecting of hot and cold water. A numerical model was developed in which the groundwater flow equation and the energy transport equation are solved simultaneously using a finite difference approximation for the time derivative and three-dimensional Galerkin-finite element approximations for the space derivatives. The use of a strict Galerkin approach led to unacceptable solution oscillations in sharp temperature front problems (i. e., problems where the temperature changes quickly over a small distance or time). Several techniques were tried in an attempt to correct the problem. Reduction of element and time step size proved ineffective in eliminating the sharp temperature front oscillation problem. An upstream weighting scheme corrected the oscillation problem, but resulted in an unacceptable smear of the sharp temperature front. A mass lumping scheme resulted in the best solution to sharp temperature front problems. The mass lumping scheme yielded solutions without the oscillation problem and with less smear than the upstream weighting scheme...|$|R
