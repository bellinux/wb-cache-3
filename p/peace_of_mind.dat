5|$|Bitter {{for having}} nothing left but a pot, the son {{closes the door}} on every person who asks for his help. Each time he does so, the pot takes on the {{symptoms}} of the ones who ask for help, it starts disturbing the son and prevents him from having any <b>peace</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b> This continues until the son finally gives up and provides aid to the town. Upon doing this, the pot's ailments are removed {{one by one and}} the son's ordeal finally ends one day when the slipper he received from his father falls out of the pot; he puts the slipper on the pot's foot and the two walk off into the sunset.|$|E
5|$|There is {{an ethical}} {{component}} {{that must be}} considered. The capability to uncover information about victims of war crimes or homicide may present a conflict in cases that involve competing interests. Forensic archaeologists are often contracted {{to assist with the}} processing of mass graves by larger organisations that have motives related to exposure and prosecution rather than providing <b>peace</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> to families and communities. These projects are at times opposed by smaller, human rights groups who wish to avoid overshadowing memories of the individuals with their violent manner(s) of death. In cases like these, forensic archaeologists must practice caution and recognize the implications behind their work and the information they uncover.|$|E

5|$|With Kesler {{back in the}} lineup, the Canucks were inconstant {{posting a}} 2–3–2 record. Kesler {{registered}} five points in the seven games, but was playing with the discomfort steaming from a blocked shot {{in his first game}} back against Dallas. He was given a CT scan for his <b>peace</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b> The results of the scan revealed a fracture in his foot. Though no time table for his return was given, the expectation was that he would be out of the line-up for four-to-six weeks. Late in the month, Kevin Bieksa suffered a groin injury in a game versus the Nashville Predators. He missed the next two games as Vancouver finished the month with back-to-back losses. After being reunited with Burrows, the Sedin twins registered a combined 18 points in the final six games of February, while Kassian tallied only three assists in the 11 games after his demotion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} between his {{election}} and his taking office, Crittenden was the lead defense counsel in the murder trial of Matt F. Ward, the son of one of Crittenden's lifelong friends. Ward's younger brother had been disciplined by the principal at Louisville Male High School the preceding November, and the elder Ward went to argue with the principal {{on behalf of his}} brother. In the ensuing encounter, Ward shot and killed the principal with a pistol. Public sentiment was heavily against Ward, and the trial was moved to Hardin County. During the week-long trial, which began in April 1854, Crittenden emphasized inconsistencies in the accounts of eyewitnesses and called prominent character witnesses such as Louisville mayor James Stephens Speed, Congressman William Preston, and Courier-Journal editor George D. Prentice. He presented a case that Ward had acted in self-defense. Because the prosecution sought the death penalty, Crittenden asserted that if the jury rendered an erroneous conviction, they would have no <b>peace</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> knowing they had sentenced an innocent man to hang.|$|E

On 31 December 2015, Satoshi Mitazono, a veteran political journalist with TV Asahi, {{announced his}} intention to run in the election as an independent candidate. During a press conference in front of the prefectural government's building, he stated his hope that Ito would [...] "pass the baton" [...] after 12 years in office. Mitazono officially declared his candidacy in February 2016, stating at this time that, as the power plant had been restarted, the safety and <b>peace</b> <b>of</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> residents was necessary, and that he would [...] "aim for a society that did not rely upon nuclear power". It was reported that anti-nuclear protest groups were preparing to field an [...] "anti-Ito" [...] candidate in the election, but the groups eventually supported Mitazono when his position on nuclear power became clearer.|$|R

25|$|While Seneca's {{doctrine}} {{appears to}} be close to the doctrine of Athenodorus's De Tranquillitate it is basically different. In De Otio 3.5 Seneca points out the benefits towards man in general, while in De Tranquillitate the theme is <b>peace</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E

25|$|Also {{important}} {{in the history of}} atheism was Epicurus (c. 300 BCE). Drawing on the ideas of Democritus and the Atomists, he espoused a materialistic philosophy wherein the universe was governed by the laws of chance without the need for divine intervention. Although he stated that deities existed, he believed that they were uninterested in human existence. The aim of the Epicureans was to attain <b>peace</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> by exposing fear of divine wrath as irrational.|$|E
