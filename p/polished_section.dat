50|$|There {{are many}} methods of {{evaluating}} the void content of materials (including composites).

5000|$|Pearceite {{is often}} {{granular}} and massive; crystals are short, tabular pseudohexagonal prisms with bevelled edges, showing triangular striations on faces {{parallel to the}} plane containing the a and b axes, and rosettes of such crystals, to 3 cm across.The mineral is black, and in <b>polished</b> <b>section</b> it is white with very dark red internal reflections.

50|$|Commesso, also {{referred}} to as Florentine mosaic, is a method of piecing together cut sections of luminous, narrow gemstones to form works of art. Precise patterns are cut into a slab of (generally black) marble. Gems are then cautiously cut and meticulously inlaid into these patterns. The work is then <b>polished</b> <b>section</b> by section, as it cannot be polished as a whole due to gems having different hardnesses. The practice, which began in Florence, Italy, dates back to at least the 14th century and gained prominence just before the 17th century. Some of its uses include making pictures and decorating furniture and architecture.|$|E
40|$|Earthen {{architectural}} fragments (burned or cemented) {{are often}} {{collected during the}} excavation in Italian prehistoric and protohistoric sites. The technological characterization of these remains is relevant to recognize the existence of local or regional building traditions and to understand the exploitation of raw materials and, more in general, the ancient production strategies. In addition to the current macroscopic analysis (morphology of fragments and classification of pastes) and before the realization of archaeometric analysis, it’s possible to complete the analytical protocol of daub with some observations in <b>polished</b> <b>section.</b> To realize a <b>polished</b> <b>section,</b> the daub sample is cut and the resulting section is polished with sandpaper. The realization {{of this kind of}} section allows a better description of the arrangement of the constituents, to identify the processes of transformation and deformation of raw materials during the building activity. The aim of these mesoscopic analysis is to characterize the behavioral chain referred to the processing of raw materials and their installation, linking the observed characteristics to specific actions. It’s possible to obtain some functional data about the original function of the earthen structures or the dynamics of entrance in the archaeological record a well. This paper presents some case-studies and some preliminary keys to understand the features observed in <b>polished</b> <b>section.</b> The use of this analytical technique gives some encouraging results, especially in comparing the number of relevant data to the low cost of production of a <b>polished</b> <b>section...</b>|$|E

The coal <b>polished</b> <b>section</b> was prepared according to the ISO 7404 - 2 (2009). The classification and the quantitative analysis of maceral were carried out according to the ISO 7404 - 1 (1994). In the recognition and quantitative statistics of maceral and minerals, the observed effective points should be more than 500. The other parts of samples were sent to State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy in Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeonotology for the identification of sporopollen and the statistics of the number.|$|E
40|$|A <b>polished</b> <b>section</b> {{of lunar}} sample 14425, an 8 mm glass bead, was studied using a {{scanning}} electron microscope and energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer. The silicon, aluminum, iron, magnesium, calcium, sodium, potassium, titanium, and chromium contents of the glass were determined. Two types of glass are visible in the <b>polished</b> <b>section.</b> One is clear and almost devoid of metallic spherules, while the other is cloudy and contains numerous metallic spherules, some less than one micron in size. Both glass types are homogeneous and identical in composition. This composition closely matches that of some Apollo 14 breccias or glass found in the breccias. The apparent similarity in composition between lunar sample 14425 and the high-magnesium microtektites found in a previous study was probably due to charging effects during analyses in which the sample was uncoated...|$|E

Two <b>polished</b> <b>sections</b> were made for each group of briquettes. The longitudinal section of the briquettes was parallel with the compression direction during briquetting while the cross-section was vertical to the direction of compression.|$|R
