40|$|In this study, {{the buffer}} {{allocation}} problem (BAP) in homogeneous, asymptotically reli-able serial <b>production</b> <b>lines</b> is considered.

The proposed algorithm is applied to <b>production</b> <b>lines</b> where the number of machines is varying from four up to a hundred machines. The proposed algo-rithm is fast because it reduces the volume of computations by rejecting allocations that do not lead to maximization of the lineâ€™s throughput.

In 1902, Ransom Olds created the <b>production</b> <b>line</b> concept for mass-producing lower-cost automobiles. Henry Ford soon refined the concept so that by 1914, middle-class laborers could afford automobiles built by Ford Motor Company.|$|E

5|$|Owing {{to budget}} {{constraints}} and the scheduled closure of Boeing's Globemaster <b>production</b> <b>line</b> in 2015, {{it was considered}} unlikely in 2012 that the RAAF would acquire more Globemasters. However, in August 2014 Minister for Defence David Johnston stated that the Government was likely to purchase a further one or two C-17s. The Government {{announced that it would}} purchase two Globemasters in October 2014, and requested information on the pricing and availability for a further pair of aircraft. In November 2014 Australia lodged a formal request with the United States Defense Security Cooperation Agency for four C-17s and associated equipment, for a total cost of $A1.85 billion. An order for the RAAF's seventh and eighth Globemasters was formally announced by Prime Minister Tony Abbott on 10April 2015. The first of the new C-17s arrived in Australia on 29 July 2015, and the second on 4 November that year. These two aircraft were among the last C-17s to have been built before the <b>production</b> <b>line</b> was closed, and it is not expected that the RAAF will acquire more Globemasters. It was reported in December 2014 that the New Zealand Government was considering purchasing between two and four Globemasters, and Australian Aviation journalist Andrew McLaughlin suggested that any such acquisition would build on Australia's C-17 support infrastructure. The New Zealand Government ultimately decided to not purchase any Globemasters.|$|E
5|$|Procurement of the Arrow from Canada, {{and setting}} up a <b>production</b> <b>line</b> in the UK, was studied, the unit price per {{aircraft}} built in the UK being estimated at Â£220,000 each for a production run of 100 aircraft, {{as opposed to the}} estimate of Â£150,000 per aircraft for the thin wing Javelin. The CF-105 would serve as a stopgap until the UK's F.155 project came to fruition; however with the F.155 due in 1963 and the Arrow not likely to reach the RAF before 1962, there was little point in proceeding.|$|E

The aircraft was intended to be built directly from the <b>production</b> <b>line,</b> skipping the traditional hand-built prototype phase. The first Arrow Mk.

Then, a formal definition of QBD is given and the QBDs are contrasted with the traditional birth-death processes. Later, examples of QBD models pertaining to <b>production</b> <b>lines</b> are presented. The rational of this exposition is to show how QBDs present themselves within the context of <b>production</b> <b>lines</b> and to show the kind of work that needs to be performed to fully specify the corresponding QBD. By compiling the aforementioned models, the strength of QBDs in modeling <b>production</b> <b>lines</b> is demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|<b>Production</b> <b>lines</b> with {{unreliable}} {{machines and}} finite buffers {{have been studied}} {{from the point of}} view of performance analysis and optimization for over 50 years. In contrast, system-theoretic properties of <b>production</b> <b>lines</b> have rarely been analyzed. These properties, however, are of significant practical and theoretical importance because they reveal the fundamental principles that characterize the behavior of such systems and can be used for their management and improvement. This dissertation is devoted to the investigation of system-theoretic properties of <b>production</b> <b>lines</b> in large volume manufacturing industries. In Control Theory, the main system-theoretic properties addressed are stability, controllability, and observability. For production systems with Markovian dynamics, the stability is ensured by the properties of the eigenvalues of the state transition matrices. As for the controllability and observability, since active feedback control is practically never used to manage <b>production</b> <b>lines,</b> they are not of immediate industrial importance. Therefore, we focus on system-theoretic properties, which are central for the management of <b>production</b> <b>lines.</b> They are: reversibility, monotonicity, improvability, effects of up- and downtime, bottlenecks, and transient behavior. For each of them, we derive tests for existence and demonstrate their applicability in case studies at automotive plants...|$|R
