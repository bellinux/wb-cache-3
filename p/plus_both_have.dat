40|$|Neoadjuvant {{chemotherapy}} (NAC) {{has drawn}} {{more attention to}} the treatment of locally advanced gastric cancer (AGC) in the current multidisciplinary treatment model. EORTC trial 40954 has recently reported that NAC plus surgery without postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy could not benefit the locally AGC patients in their overall survival. We performed a meta-analysis of 10 studies including 1518 gastric cancer patients. Stratified subgroups were NAC plus surgery and NAC <b>plus</b> <b>both</b> surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy (AC), while control was surgery alone. The results showed that NAC plus surgery did not benefit the patients with locally AGC in their overall survival [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 20, 95 % CI 0. 80 - 1. 80, P = 0. 37] and the number needed to treat (NNT) was 74. However, the NAC <b>plus</b> <b>both</b> surgery and AC had a slight overall survival benefit (OR = 1. 33, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 1. 71, P = 0. 03) and NNT was 14, which is superior to the NAC plus surgery. Therefore, we recommend that combined NAC and AC should be used to improve the overall survival of the locally AGC patients...|$|R
