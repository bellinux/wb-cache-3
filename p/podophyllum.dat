A decade long study by Prof. Chandra Prakash Kala concluded that the Valley of Flowers is endowed with 520 species of higher plants (angiosperms, gymnosperms and pteridophytes), of these 498 are flowering plants. The park has many species of medicinal plants including Dactylorhiza hatagirea, Picrorhiza kurroa, Aconitum violaceum, Polygonatum multiflorum, Fritillaria roylei, and <b>Podophyllum</b> hexandrum. In the summer season of 2016, a large portion of forests in Uttarakhand caught fires and rubbled to ashes during Uttarakhand forest fires incident which resulted in the damage of forest resources worth billions of rupees and death of 6 people with hundreds of wild animals died during fires.|$|E
25|$|Podophyllotoxin is an antineoplastic lignan {{obtained}} {{primarily from}} the American Mayapple (<b>Podophyllum</b> peltatum) and Himalayan Mayapple (<b>Podophyllum</b> hexandrum or <b>Podophyllum</b> emodi). It has anti-microtubule activity, and its mechanism {{is similar to that}} of vinca alkaloids in that they bind to tubulin, inhibiting microtubule formation. Podophyllotoxin is used to produce two other drugs with different mechanisms of action: etoposide and teniposide.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is not {{necessary}} since the lesion is benign, however the person may have esthetic concerns about the appearance. The condition often resolves rapidly with high dose acyclovir or desiclovir but recurs once this therapy is stopped, or as the underlying immunocompromise worsens. Topical use of <b>podophyllum</b> resin or retinoids has also been reported to produce temporary remission. Antiretroviral drugs such as zidovudine may be effective in producing a significant regression of OHL. Recurrence of the lesion may also signify that {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) is becoming ineffective.|$|E

The chemists, under the direction of A. von Wartburg, analysed this impurity. Guided by Stähelin's in-vitro and in-vivo assays, they found the active compound responsible for the good antitumor activity of SP-G (Proresid oral) and SP-I (Proresid intravenous; discovered in April 1959, commercialized 1963). Further chemical modifications led to the well-known thenylidene derivative VM-26 (teniposide, Vumon, discovered in October 1965, commercialized by Sandoz in 1976) and to the ethylidene derivative VP-16-213 (etoposide, Vepesid, discovered on October 21, 1966), which remains very clinically successful.|$|E

[...] By the 1940s, the ingredients included various purgatives, cholagogues, and carminatives, including aloin (aloe), <b>Podophyllum,</b> cascara, scammony, jalap, colocynth, leptandrin, saponis (soap), cardamom, capsicum, ginger, peppermint oil, and gentian, mixed with liquorice, powdered gum (acacia or tragacanth) and glucose, coated with black charcoal or carbon powder to form ovoid pills.|$|E

These formed a rank and dense herbaceous, mostly annual vegetation, six feet high, bound together with Cuscuta, climbing Leguminosae, and Ceropegia. The great summer heat and moisture here favour the ascent of various tropical genera, of which I found in August several Orchideae (Calanthe, Microstylis, and Coelogyne), also Begonia, Bryonia, Cynanchum, Aristolochia, Eurya, Procris, Acanthaceae, and Cyrtandraseae.] The rocks were all of gneiss, with granite veins, tourmaline, and occasionally pieces of pure plumbago.|$|E

50|$|The genus is {{not universally}} {{recognised}} by this name, as some authorities include {{the plants in}} the genus <b>Podophyllum.</b> Dysosma is recognised by other authorities as including only those <b>Podophyllum</b> species which originate in China.

The single umbrella-shaped leaves grow on an erect stem that usually stands 12 - 24 in, but with height varying with species. The leaves may be completely green or mottled and flecked with purple; they have an entire or deeply serrated edge depending on species. The flowers are nodding and {{in a range of}} colours.
