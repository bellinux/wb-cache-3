5|$|Ferugliotherium {{was much}} smaller than the sudamericids Gondwanatherium and Sudamerica, and its body mass is {{estimated}} to have been about 70g (2.5oz). Unlike the hypsodont (high-crowned) sudamericids, Ferugliotherium has brachydont (low-crowned) molariform teeth that are supported by at least two roots, not a single massive root. The direction of wear on the teeth indicates that Ferugliotherium, Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica all had palinal jaw movement (i.e., the lower jaw moved backwards during the <b>power</b> <b>stroke</b> of chewing)—a feature otherwise only seen in multituberculates among mammals.|$|E
5|$|In all {{butterflies}} (with {{the exception}} of male Euschemoninae) and in Bombycoidea moths (with {{the exception of}} the Sphingidae), there is no arrangement of frenulum and retinaculum to couple the wings. Instead, an enlarged humeral area of the hindwing is broadly overlapped by the forewing. Despite the absence of a specific mechanical connection, the wings overlap and operate in phase. The <b>power</b> <b>stroke</b> of the forewing pushes down the hindwing in unison. This type of coupling is a variation of frenate type but where the frenulum and retinaculum are completely lost.|$|E

50|$|In 1900 Ernst Körting filed patents for a novel {{design of}} gas engine. This engine {{had a single}} water cooled piston that was double acting, i.e. the {{cylinder}} had combustion chambers at either end. As the engine was a 2-stroke this gave it continuous <b>power</b> <b>strokes,</b> much as a double acting steam engine. The lack of continuous <b>power</b> <b>strokes</b> in internal combustion engines was perceived by those used to steam as having the potential for mechanical problems due to the intermittent <b>power</b> <b>strokes.</b> The Körting design was quite successful {{in a range of}} applications particularly large installations powered by blast furnace gas.|$|R
50|$|Although {{an inline}} six-cylinder engine {{can also be}} timed for {{inherent}} primary and secondary balance, a straight-eight develops more <b>power</b> <b>strokes</b> per revolution and, as a result, will run more smoothly under load than an inline six.

50|$|A narrow angle V-twin {{such as the}} 45° Harley-Davidson {{naturally}} has slightly unevenly spaced <b>power</b> <b>strokes.</b> By {{changing the}} ignition timing {{on one of the}} cylinders by 360° the <b>power</b> <b>strokes</b> are very closely spaced.

25|$|Wankel {{rotary engine}} and piston engine displacement, and {{corresponding}} power, output can more accurately be compared by displacement per {{revolution of the}} eccentric shaft. A calculation of this form dictates that a two-rotor Wankel displacing 654cc per face will have a displacement of 1.3 liters per every rotation of the eccentric shaft (only two total faces, one face per rotor going through a full <b>power</b> <b>stroke)</b> and 2.6 liters after two revolutions (four total faces, two faces per rotor going through a full <b>power</b> <b>stroke).</b> The results are directly comparable to a 2.6-liter piston engine with an even number of cylinders in a conventional firing order, which will likewise displace 1.3 liters through its <b>power</b> <b>stroke</b> after one revolution of the crankshaft, and 2.6 liters through its power strokes after two revolutions of the crankshaft. A Wankel rotary engine is still a four-stroke engine, and pumping losses from non-power strokes still apply, but the absence of throttling valves and a 50% longer stroke duration result in a significantly lower pumping loss compared to a four-stroke reciprocating piston engine. Measuring a Wankel rotary engine in this way more accurately explains its specific output, because the volume of its air fuel mixture put through a complete <b>power</b> <b>stroke</b> per revolution is directly responsible for torque, and thus the power produced.|$|E
25|$|While a {{four-stroke}} {{piston engine}} completes one combustion stroke per cylinder for every two rotations of the crankshaft (that is, one-half <b>power</b> <b>stroke</b> per crankshaft rotation per cylinder), each combustion chamber in the Wankel generates one combustion stroke per driveshaft rotation, i.e. one <b>power</b> <b>stroke</b> per rotor orbital revolution and three power strokes per rotor rotation. Thus, the power output of a Wankel engine is generally {{higher than that}} of a four-stroke piston engine of similar engine displacement in a similar state of tune; and {{higher than that of}} a four-stroke piston engine of similar physical dimensions and weight.|$|E
50|$|The dual {{bearings}} {{contact the}} two cams {{in the opposite}} side which cancels the side forces out. The piston assembly does not experience any side force which reduces wear and lubrication requirements at the cylinder contact. One module, which consists of a minimum of five moving components, produces six <b>power</b> <b>strokes</b> per revolution. Increasing the number of lobes on each cam to five produces ten <b>power</b> <b>strokes</b> without {{increasing the number of}} components.|$|R
50|$|In {{two-stroke}} engines, {{the crank}} angle is generally 180°, which gives two <b>power</b> <b>strokes</b> in each revolution. This configuration vibrates {{at twice the}} frequency but half the amplitude of a single-cylinder engine of the same capacity.|$|R
50|$|The first Brooks bus {{incorporated}} standard {{steam car}} technology, using a V8 poppet-valve engine; because both strokes in a steam engine are <b>power</b> <b>strokes,</b> the eight-cylinder engine {{was said to}} be the equivalent of a gasoline V16.|$|R
25|$|BAE Systems (previously {{teamed with}} Navistar) realigned its {{team for the}} EMD phase to include Ford (Ford Motor Company's <b>Power</b> <b>Stroke</b> 6.7 liter {{turbocharged}} diesel engine; Ford had been considering participating in the JLTV's EMD competition with its own offering) and proposed a design that capitalized on earlier TD phase work with the Valanx.|$|E
25|$|The first Watt engines were {{atmospheric}} pressure engines, like the Newcomen engine {{but with the}} condensation taking place separate from the cylinder. Driving the engines using both low pressure steam and a partial vacuum {{raised the possibility of}} reciprocating engine development. An arrangement of valves could alternately admit low pressure steam to the cylinder and then connect with the condenser. Consequently, the direction of the <b>power</b> <b>stroke</b> might be reversed, making it easier to obtain rotary motion. Additional benefits of the double acting engine were increased efficiency, higher speed (greater power) and more regular motion.|$|E
25|$|The gas {{follows the}} {{behaviour}} {{described by the}} gas laws, which describe how a gas's pressure, temperature and volume are related. When the gas is heated the pressure rises (because {{it is in a}} sealed chamber) and this pressure then acts on the power piston to produce a <b>power</b> <b>stroke.</b> When the gas is cooled the pressure drops and this drop means that less work needs to be done by the piston to compress the gas on the return stroke; the difference in work between the strokes yields a net positive power output.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of 2-stroke engines {{of this type}} is mechanical simplicity and a higher power-to-weight ratio than their 4-stroke counterparts. Despite having twice as many <b>power</b> <b>strokes</b> per cycle, less than twice {{the power of a}} comparable 4-stroke engine is attainable in practice.|$|R
50|$|A {{big bang}} engine is an {{unconventional}} motorcycle engine {{designed so that}} most of the <b>power</b> <b>strokes</b> occur simultaneously or in close succession. This is achieved by changing the ignition timing, changing or re-timing the camshaft, and sometimes in combination with a change in crankpin angle. The goal is to change the power delivery characteristics of the engine. A regular firing multi-cylinder engine fires at approximately even intervals, giving a smooth-running engine. Because of a big bang engine's power delivery imbalance, there exists more vibration and stress in the engine. Thus, the power peaks are very strong and can overwhelm the rear tire (if used in a motorcycle), but when the rear tire does slide, the temporary lull in <b>power</b> between <b>power</b> <b>strokes</b> generally makes the slide easier to catch.|$|R
40|$|Protein {{degradation}} by the ClpXP protease requires {{collaboration among}} the six AAA+ domains of ClpX. Using single-molecule optical tweezers, Sen et al. show that ClpX uses a coordinated succession of <b>power</b> <b>strokes</b> to translocate polypeptides in ATP-tunable bursts before reloading with nucleotide. This strategy allows ClpX to kinetically capture transiently unfolded intermediates...|$|R
25|$|In muscle cells, {{actomyosin}} myofibrils makeup {{much of the}} cytoplasmic material. These myofibrils {{are made}} of thin filaments of actin (typically around 7nm in diameter), and thick filaments of the motor-protein myosin (typically around 15nm in diameter). These myofibrils use energy derived from ATP to create movements of cells, such as muscle contraction. Using the hydrolysis of ATP for energy, myosin heads undergo a cycle during which they attach to thin filaments, exert a tension, and then, depending on the load, perform a <b>power</b> <b>stroke</b> that causes the thin filaments to slide past, shortening the muscle.|$|E
25|$|With {{high-performance}} camshaft timing, {{exhaust valves}} in different cylinders can be {{open at the}} same time, overlapping {{at the end of}} the <b>power</b> <b>stroke</b> in one cylinder and the end of exhaust stroke in another. In twin-scroll designs, the exhaust manifold physically separates the channels for cylinders that can interfere with each other, so that the pulsating exhaust gasses flow through separate spirals (scrolls). With common firing order 1-3-4-2, two scrolls of unequal length pair cylinders 1-4 and 3-2. This lets the engine efficiently use exhaust scavenging techniques, which decreases exhaust gas temperatures and NOx emissions, improves turbine efficiency, and reduces turbo lag evident at low engine speeds.|$|E
25|$|In {{an article}} in Motor Cycle {{magazine}} in 1914, Alfred Scott wrote that {{he was drawn to}} the two-stroke engine because he was trained on high speed steam and marine engines, and when turning his attention to gas and petrol engines the regular power strokes of the two-stroke (or Day cycle as he sometimes called it), seemed preferable to the one <b>power</b> <b>stroke</b> in four of the Otto cycle. He said this attraction to the two stroke was further enhanced by the reliable and excellent service from a two stroke engine designed by his brother (A. F. Scott M.I.M.E) and used to drive machinery in his experimental workshop.|$|E
5000|$|On 2-stroke parallel-twin engines, the 180° crank {{configuration}} {{was almost}} universally adopted, giving two <b>power</b> <b>strokes</b> in each revolution.

50|$|Labyrinth seals {{are also}} found on pistons, which use them to store oil and seal against high {{pressure}} during compression and <b>power</b> <b>strokes,</b> {{as well as on}} other non-rotating shafts. In these applications, it is the long and difficult path and the formation of controlled fluid vortices plus some limited contact-sealing action that creates the seal.|$|R
25|$|A {{four-stroke}} cylinder {{produces a}} <b>power</b> <b>stroke</b> only every other {{rotation of the}} crankshaft, with three strokes being pumping losses. This doubles the real surface-to-volume ratio for the four-stroke reciprocating piston engine and the displacement increased. The Wankel, therefore, has higher volumetric efficiency and lower pumping losses through the absence of choking valves. Because of the quasi-overlap of the power strokes, that cause the smoothness of the engine and the avoidance of the four-stroke cycle in a reciprocating engine, the Wankel engine is very quick to react to power increases, giving a quick delivery of power when the demand arises, especially at higher rpm's. This difference is more pronounced when compared to four-cylinder reciprocating engines and less pronounced when compared to higher cylinder counts.|$|E
25|$|The first {{full-scale}} working railway {{steam locomotive}} {{was built in}} the United Kingdom in 1804 by Richard Trevithick, a British engineer born in Cornwall. This used high-pressure steam to drive the engine by one <b>power</b> <b>stroke.</b> The transmission system employed a large flywheel to even out the action of the piston rod. On 21 February 1804, the world's first steam-powered railway journey in the world took place when Trevithick's unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway of the Penydarren ironworks, near Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales. Trevithick later demonstrated a locomotive operating upon a piece of circular rail track in Bloomsbury, London, the Catch Me Who Can, but never got beyond the experimental stage with railway locomotives, not least because his engines were too heavy for the cast-iron plateway track then in use.|$|E
25|$|A high-octane-rated fuel, such as {{liquefied}} {{petroleum gas}} (LPG) has an overall lower power output at the typical 10:1 compression ratio of an engine design optimized for gasoline fuel. An engine tuned for LPG fuel via higher compression ratios (typically 12:1) improves the power output. This is because higher-octane fuels allow for a higher compression ratio without knocking, resulting in a higher cylinder temperature, which improves efficiency. Also, increased mechanical efficiency is created by a higher compression ratio through the concomitant higher expansion ratio on the <b>power</b> <b>stroke,</b> which {{is by far the}} greater effect. The higher expansion ratio extracts more work from the high-pressure gas created by the combustion process. An Atkinson cycle engine uses the timing of the valve events to produce the benefits of a high expansion ratio without the disadvantages, chiefly detonation, of a high compression ratio. A high expansion ratio {{is also one of the}} two key reasons for the efficiency of diesel engines, along with the elimination of pumping losses due to throttling of the intake air flow.|$|E
50|$|This {{method of}} {{speed-control}} {{is often referred}} to as the Hit or Miss method because the engine mis-fires (for lack of fuel-mixture) on those power-strokes where the engine is running faster than the governed speed, but will hit (fire) on <b>power</b> <b>strokes</b> where the speed is too low. Note that no fuel is used on the mis-fire strokes.|$|R
5000|$|Two-stroke engines {{have fewer}} moving parts than {{four-stroke}} engines, and produce {{twice the number}} of <b>power</b> <b>strokes</b> per revolution; consequently, two-stroke engines are more powerful for their mass.

[...] Two-stroke engines have shorter life due to poorer piston lubrication, since lubrication comes from the fuel-oil mix.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Eective escape {{behavior}} {{contributes to}} the success of copepods in planktonic communities. The kinematics of escape were studied in tethered Undinula vulgaris (Calanoida) by analyzing the timing and mag-nitude of their <b>power</b> <b>strokes</b> to a precisely controlled, sudden mechanical perturbation in the surrounding water. Copepods responded with rapid swims to water velocities of 36 to 86 lm s) 1. Reaction times were under 2. 5 ms following stimulus onset.

The behavioral reaction times and intervals between multiple responses observed in this calanoid are among the shortest reported in aquatic invertebrates...|$|R
25|$|Although the 200Tdi engine {{had been}} an undoubted {{technological}} and sales success, it had certain limitations and flaws {{that needed to be}} rectified. Despite the numerous differences, it was still in essence a direct-injection version of the older Diesel Turbo engine. It was also considered rather raucous and unrefined, especially for use in the Discovery and Range Rover models. A special version of the engine had to be produced to fit the Defender, and problems with weak head gasket had been identified. The British Army (and some other military buyers) had not opted for the 200Tdi because it could not be fitted with a 24-volt generator for powering radio equipment- instead the Army continued to buy vehicles with 2.5-litre naturally aspirated diesels. Upcoming European diesel emissions regulations (Euro I) meant that Land Rover would be forced to radically alter the engine anyway. The resulting development project (coded Romulus) produced the 300Tdi engine. Although externally very similar to the Discovery/Range Rover version of its predecessor, 208 changes were made. These included modifications to the block, cylinder head, fuel injector system and ancillary systems. The crankshaft, pistons and connecting rods were significantly altered over the 200Tdi. The most obvious external changes were the fitting of a rubber acoustic cover over the engine to reduce noise and the change to a single serpentine belt to drive the ancillaries instead of the multiple V-belts of the older engines. Emissions regulation included the fitting of an exhaust gas recirculation system. Power and torque outputs remained the same, and the engine had been specifically designed to be compatible with all the models in the Land Rover range without any changes. This meant that the Defender engines were fitted in the same tune as the Discovery/Range Rover engines. The 300Tdi was noticeably smoother and quieter than the 200Tdi, but was generally found to not be quite as economical in real-world use. It turned out that the Euro I emissions regulations were not as severe as Land Rover anticipated, and so the 300Tdi was able to remain in production until the introduction of the Euro III rules. When fitted to vehicles with an automatic transmission, power was increased to 122 horsepower {{to make up for the}} power losses in the transmission. These engines (designated 23L) had Bosch Electronic Diesel Control systems, where the mechanical injector system was controlled by a drive-by-wire electronic throttle to reduce emissions. The 300Tdi was replaced in 1998 by the 5-cylinder Td5, bringing to an end the line of Land Rover 4-cylinder engines that can be traced back to 1957. The Td5 engine was loosely based on the Rover Group's L-series diesel engine. The 300Tdi remained in production in Brazil, and was offered as an option on rest of world (non-UK/Europe) models. Following Ford's acquisition of Land Rover in 2000, the engine was used in Brazilian-built Ford pick-up trucks as well. Increasing emissions laws worldwide and falling sales led to production of the 300Tdi ending in 2006. A much-modified 2.8-litre version was built by International Engines in Brazil until 2010, and was available as an after-market fitment to Land Rovers through specialist converters. International then became MWM International Motores and a further update of the 300Tdi design was launched as the 3.0 <b>Power</b> <b>Stroke.</b> Although based around the same block and basic architecture as the 300Tdi the <b>Power</b> <b>Stroke</b> has major differences such as electronic common rail injection and new crossflow cylinder head with Overhead camshaft.|$|E
25|$|Some {{evidence}} to show that ATP binding is indeed the <b>power</b> <b>stroke</b> of the transport cycle was reported. It has been shown that ATP binding induces changes in the substrate-binding properties of the TMDs. The affinity of ABC transporters for substrates has been difficult to measure directly, and indirect measurements, for instance through stimulation of ATPase activity, often reflects other rate-limiting steps. Recently, direct measurement of vinblastine binding to permease-glycoprotein (P-glycoprotein) in the presence of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, e.g. 5’-adenylyl-β-γ-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), showed that ATP binding, in the absence of hydrolysis, is sufficient to reduce substrate-binding affinity. Also, ATP binding induces substantial conformational changes in the TMDs. Spectroscopic, protease accessibility and crosslinking studies have shown that ATP binding to the NBDs induces conformational changes in multidrug resistance-associated protein-1 (MRP1), HisPMQ, LmrA, and Pgp. Two dimensional crystal structures of AMP-PNP-bound Pgp showed that the major conformational change during the transport cycle occurs upon ATP binding and that subsequent ATP hydrolysis introduces more limited changes. Rotation and tilting of transmembrane α-helices may both contribute to these conformational changes. Other studies have focused on confirming that ATP binding induces NBD closed dimer formation. Biochemical studies of intact transport complexes suggest that the conformational changes in the NBDs are relatively small. In the absence of ATP, the NBDs may be relatively flexible, but they do not involve a major reorientation of the NBDs with respect to the other domains. ATP binding induces a rigid body rotation of the two ABC subdomains with respect to each other, which allows the proper alignment of the nucleotide in the active site and interaction with the designated motifs. There is strong biochemical evidence that binding of two ATP molecules can be cooperative, that is, ATP must bind to the two active site pockets before the NBDs can dimerize and form the closed, catalytically active conformation.|$|E

Hence ctenophores usually swim in the direction in which the mouth is eating, unlike jellyfish. When trying to escape predators, one species can accelerate to six times its normal speed; some other species reverse direction as part of their escape behavior, by reversing the <b>power</b> <b>stroke</b> of the comb plate cilia.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} the kinematics of escape jumps in three species of 0. 3 – 3. 0 mm-sized planktonic copepods. We find similar kinematics between species with periodically alternating <b>power</b> <b>strokes</b> and passive coasting and a resulting highly fluctuating escape velocity. By direct numerical simulations, we estimate {{the force and}} power output needed to accelerate and overcome drag. Both are very high {{compared with those of}} other organisms, as are the escape velocities in comparison to startle velocities of other aquatic animals. Thus, the maximum weight-specific force, which for muscle motors of other animals {{has been found to be}} near constant at 57 N (kg muscle) − 1, is more than an order of magnitude higher for the escaping copepods. We argue that this is feasible because most copepods have different systems for steady propulsion (feeding appendages) and intensive escapes (swimming legs), with the muscular arrangement of the latter probably adapted for high force production during short-lasting bursts. The resulting escape velocities scale with body length to power 0. 65, different from the size-scaling of both similar sized and larger animals moving at constant velocity, but similar to that found for startle velocities in other aquatic organisms. The relative duration of the pauses between <b>power</b> <b>strokes</b> was observed to increase with organism size. We demonstrate that this is an inherent property of swimming by alternating <b>power</b> <b>strokes</b> and pauses. We finally show that the Strouhal number is in the range of peak propulsion efficiency, again suggesting that copepods are optimally designed for rapid escape jumps...|$|R

Oxygen consumption was tightly correlated to swimming effort during the first 12 h of swimming indicating that swimming is powered predominantly by aerobic metabolism. The patterns of swimming effort and oxygen consumption could be divided into three distinct phases: (1) the rapid fatigue phase from 0 to 2 h when the mean swim thrust decreased from 45 to 30 mN and oxygen consumption decreased from 33 to 18 ml h– 1; (2) the slow fatigue phase from 2 to 12 h when the mean swim thrust decreased from 30 to 22 mN and oxygen consumption decreased from 18 to 10 ml h– 1; and (3) the sustained effort phase from 12 to 18 h when mean swim thrust averaged 22 mN and oxygen consumption averaged 10 ml h– 1. The decrease in mean swim thrust {{was caused by a}} combination of a decrease in front flipper stroke rate during a <b>power</b> <b>stroking</b> bout, a decrease in mean maximum thrust during a <b>power</b> <b>stroking</b> bout and a decrease in the proportion of time spent <b>power</b> <b>stroking.</b> Hence hatchlings maximise their swimming thrust as soon as they enter the water, a time when a fast swimming speed will maximise the chance of surviving the gauntlet of predators inhabiting the shallow fringing reef before reaching the relative safety of deeper water...|$|R
