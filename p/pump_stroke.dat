50|$|Compressed gas {{enters the}} valve of the Phantom, {{pressing}} the cup seal assembly against the retainer with the aide of the valve spring. This gas forces the valve to stay sealed {{and allows the}} gun to be cocked which prepares the hammer of the paintball marker for firing. Without {{the pressure of the}} gas in the valve the gun cannot be cocked. As indicated by the term pump action the first step in firing the marker is the <b>pump</b> <b>stroke</b> which uses the rod connecting the pump handle and bolt to cock the marker. The <b>pump</b> <b>stroke</b> consists of two parts; the backward <b>pump</b> <b>stroke</b> and the forward <b>pump</b> <b>stroke.</b> On the backward <b>pump</b> <b>stroke</b> the bolt moves back, compressing the main spring until the bolt and hammer are connected by the sear. At this time a single ball drops into the breech. Next, during the forward <b>pump</b> <b>stroke,</b> both the bolt and hammer move forward, chambering the paintball sealing the breech. Next, as the trigger is pulled, the sear pivots and releases the hammer from the bolt. The compressed main spring forces the hammer back until it reaches the rear of the power tube and provides enough energy to force the power tube back. As the power tube is pushed back the valve opens and compressed gas flows through the power tube and the tuned port compensator (TPC), projecting the paintball out of the barrel.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree of}} flexing and the {{material}} constituting the diaphragm affects the maintenance life of the equipment. Generally stiff metal diaphragms may only displace a few cubic centimeters of volume because the metal can not endure large degrees of flexing without cracking, but the stiffness of a metal diaphragm allows it to pump at high pressures. Rubber or silicone diaphragms are capable of enduring deep <b>pumping</b> <b>strokes</b> of very high flexion, but their low strength limits their use to low-pressure applications, {{and they need to}} be replaced as plastic embrittlement occurs.|$|R
50|$|Pneumatic systems used {{compressed}} gas for power, usually compressed air. This air may be compressed by the gun for each shot, {{in a single}} <b>stroke</b> or <b>pump</b> (multiple <b>stroke)</b> gun, {{or it may be}} precharged by an external compressor.|$|R
5000|$|The Model 1322 is a {{pneumatic}} pump-action air pistol utilizing [...]22 (5.5 mm) caliber lead pellets. The pistol's {{integral pump}} lever mechanism is located underneath the barrel, {{integral to the}} forearm. This pump lever is cycled a variable number of times (up {{to a maximum of}} ten strokes) to store increasingly pressurized air in a chamber. When the trigger is activated, an air valve dumps the pressurized air into a transfer port integral to the breech, discharging the pellet from the barrel. According to the manufacturer, a maximum velocity of up to 440 ft/s was achievable with ten <b>pump</b> <b>strokes,</b> using standard 14.3-grain [...]22 pellets. [...] The Model 1322 features fully adjustable square notch rear and front fixed blade sights.|$|R

50|$|Over the years, {{several new}} pieces were {{introduced}} in this line as well. The new pump was spring based, and could only be operated by hand, which limited pneumatic power to how fast it could be manually pumped. This obviously limited the power of pneumatic circuits. So in 1992, LEGO introduced two new pieces; a small pump and a small cylinder. The small pump {{did not have a}} spring on it, and it was designed to be operated by a motor, which would allow for continuously-running pneumatic creations. As of 2011, the small pump has only appeared in one set — 8868 Air Tech Claw Rig (1992) (found on Peeron) — and a few parts sets (no longer available). A new version of the small pump was released in Lego set 8110 Unimog U400 (2011). At 2L, this <b>pump's</b> <b>stroke</b> is 1/3 longer than the old one's 1.5L, 'L' being the LEGO unit of a stud.

50|$|Most images {{show only}} the engine side, giving no {{information}} on the pumps.

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the variability of}} 3 D echo derived circumferential and longitudinal strain values computed from vendor-specific and vendor-independent analyses of images acquired using ultrasound systems from different vendors. Ten freshly harvested porcine hearts were studied. Each heart was mounted on a custom designed phantom and driven to simulate normal cardiac motion. Cardiac rotation was digitally controlled and held constant at 5 °, while <b>pumped</b> <b>stroke</b> volume (SV) ranged from 30 - 70 ml. Full-volume image data was acquired using three different ultrasound systems from different vendors. The image data was analyzed for longitudinal and circumferential strains (LS, CS) using both vendor-specific and vendor-independent analysis packages. Good linear relationships were observed for each vendor-specific analysis package for both CS and LS at the mid-anterior segment, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 82 - 0. 91 (CS) and 0. 86 - 0. 89 (LS). Comparable linear regressions were observed for results determined by a vendor independent program (CS: R = 0. 82 - 0. 89; LS: R = 0. 86 - 0. 89). Variability between analysis packages was examined via a series of ANOVA tests. A statistical difference was found between vendor-specific analysis packages (p 0. 05). Circumferential and longitudinal regional strain values differ when quantified by vendor-specific analysis packages; however, this variability is mitigated by use of a vendor-independent quantification method. These results suggest that echocardiograms acquired using different ultrasound systems could be meaningfully compared using vendor-independent software...|$|R
5000|$|Water is {{diverted}} {{from the river}} by Warleigh Weir, about 200 yd upstream. The water flows to the pumping station down a 30 ft wide leat, which is crossed by a single segmental arch bridge with a central keystone. The water passes over depressing sluices which can be raised or lowered by hand cranking, and then powers a breastshot water wheel. The 24 ft wide wheel is in two sections each 12 ft wide and 17 ft in diameter with a 9 in gap between them. The wheel has 48 wooden [...] "starts", supporting 96 float boards {{each of which is}} 13 in by 1 in by 12 ft and made of Iroko. The breastshot wheel is vertically mounted, and falling water strikes the blades. Breastshot wheels are less efficient than overshot wheels, more efficient than undershot wheels, and are not backshot.At full power the wheel uses 2 tons (2 tonnes) of water per second and rotates five times a minute. The water wheel drives a flexible coupling to a pit wheel with a diameter of 16 ft, which has 408 hand-fitted wooden teeth that mesh with a 5 ft cast iron gear, increasing the speed to 16 rpm. From there, cranks drive vertical connecting rods that transfer the energy to two 18 ft long cast iron rocking beams made by Boulton and Watt. Each rocking beam drives an 18 in diameter lift pump, which also takes its supply from the mill leat.

5000|$|The Avon Valley between Bradford on Avon and Bath is {{a classic}} {{geographical}} example of a valley where four forms of ground transport are found: road, rail, river, canal. The river passes under the Avoncliff and Dundas Aqueducts and at Freshford is joined by the Somerset River Frome. Avoncliff Aqueduct was built by John Rennie and chief engineer John Thomas, between 1797 and 1801. The aqueduct consists of three arches and is 110 yd long with a central elliptical arch of 60 ft span with two side arches each semicircular and 34 ft across, all with V-jointed arch stones. The spandrel and wing walls are built in alternate courses of ashlar masonry, and rock-faced blocks. The central span sagged soon after it was built and has been repaired many times. The Dundas Aqueduct was built by the same team between 1797 and 1801 and completed in 1805. James McIlquham was appointed contractor. The aqueduct is 150 yd long with three arches built of Bath Stone, with Doric pilasters, and balustrades at each end. The central semicircular arch spans 64 ft; the two oval side arches span 20 ft. It is a grade I listed building, {{and was the first}} canal structure to be designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1951. The stretch of river below and above the aqueduct, where it is joined by Midford Brook, is used by the Bluefriars of the Monkton Combe School Boat Club up to six days a week since at least the 1960s.It then flows past Claverton Pumping Station, which pumped water from the River Avon into the canal, using power from the flow of the river. The pumping station is located in a pump house built of Bath Stone, located at river level. Water is diverted from the river by Warleigh Weir, about 200 yd upstream. The water flows down a leat to the pumping station, where it powers a water wheel, 24 ft wide and 17 ft in diameter, with 48 wooden slats. At full power the wheel uses 2 tons (2 tonnes) of water per second and rotates five times a minute. The water wheel drives gearing which increases the speed to 16 rpm. From here, cranks drive vertical connecting rods which transfer the energy to two 18 ft long cast iron rocking beams. Each rocking beam in turn drives an 18 in (0.5 m) diameter lift pump, which also take their supply from the mill leat. Each <b>pump</b> <b>stroke</b> raises 50 imp gal of water to the canal.

30|$|At present, {{the general}} {{idea is that}} the {{variable}} speed drive technology can decrease the polished rod peak load, the energy consumption and increase the oil production of the pumping system. However, in the beginning, the variable speed drive technology only improved the upstroke speed and decreased the down stroke speed of the prime motor. Now the variable speed drive technology can be used to change the speed curve of motor in a <b>pump</b> <b>stroke</b> period to redistribution the speed profile for a more stable operating range and a lower polished rod peak load and a less energy consumption of pumping system.|$|E
50|$|The first {{safe and}} {{successful}} {{steam power plant}} was introduced by Thomas Newcomen in 1712. Newcomen apparently conceived his machine quite independently of Savery, but as the latter had taken out a very wide-ranging patent, Newcomen and his associates were obliged {{to come to an}} arrangement with him, marketing the engine until 1733 under a joint patent. Newcomen's engine appears to have been based on Papin's experiments carried out 30 years earlier, and employed a piston and cylinder, one end of which was open to the atmosphere above the piston. Steam just above atmospheric pressure (all that the boiler could stand) was introduced into {{the lower half of the}} cylinder beneath the piston during the gravity-induced upstroke; the steam was then condensed by a jet of cold water injected into the steam space to produce a partial vacuum; the pressure differential between the atmosphere and the vacuum on either side of the piston displaced it downwards into the cylinder, raising the opposite end of a rocking beam to which was attached a gang of gravity-actuated reciprocating force pumps housed in the mineshaft. The engine's downward power <b>stroke</b> raised the <b>pump,</b> priming it and preparing the <b>pumping</b> <b>stroke.</b> At first the phases were controlled by hand, but within ten years an escapement mechanism had been devised worked by of a vertical plug tree suspended from the rocking beam which rendered the engine self-acting.|$|R

40|$|Following on a {{preceding}} {{paper of}} the same title [1], {{and the establishment of}} the dependence of the wind-pump performance on the wind-pump’s Froude number,, an analytical analysis of the wind-pump’s design parameters is further developed in this work. The result was the formulation of the system criteria that continuously match the load with the varying wind speed and water head. This led to a design procedure that entails variation of the <b>pump</b> <b>stroke,</b> the rotational speed-ratio or the turbine’s pitch angle to sustain a continuous peak performance. The stroke and speed-ratio variations are such that any of them is continuously proportional to the square of the wind-pump’s Froude number. The pitch-angle variation technique requires an inverse relation between the design torquecoefficient and the square of Froude number. The suggested power maximization techniques lead to the continuous operation of the turbine at its maximum power-coefficient point, as long as the operational Froude number is above its stop limit.

40|$|The {{operation}} of a high-pressure, piston-plunger fuel pump, oriented {{for use in the}} common rail circuit of modern Diesel engines for providing fuel to the injectors is investigated in the present study from a numerical perspective. Both the suction and pressurization phases of the <b>pump</b> <b>stroke</b> were simulated with the overall flow time be-ing in the order of 12 • 10 - 3 s. The topology of the cavitating flow within the pump con-figuration was captured through the use of an Equation of State (EoS) implemented in the framework of a barotropic, homogeneous equilibrium model. Cavitation was found to set in within the pressure chamber as early as 0. 2 • 10 - 3 s in the operating cycle, while the minimum liquid volume fraction detected was in the order of 60 % during the sec-ond period of the valve opening. Increase of the in-cylinder pressure during the final stages of the pumping stroke lead to the collapse of the previously arisen cavitation structures and three layout locations, namely the piston edge, the valve/valve-seat re-gion and the outlet orifice, were identified as vulnerable to cavitation-induced erosion through the use of cavitation-aggressiveness indicators...|$|E
30|$|Different {{techniques}} which utilize two {{pressure sensors}} {{have been proposed}} to reduce or eliminate mud pump noises and recover downhole telemetry signals. During mud pressure signal generation, activated pulsar provides an uplink signal at the downhole location and the at least two sensor measurements are used to estimate the mud channel transfer function (Reckmann 2008). The telemetry signal and the first signal (pressure signal or flow rate signal) are used to activate the pulsar and provide an uplink signal at the downhole location; second signal received at the surface detectors is processed to estimate the telemetry signal; a third signal responsive to the uplink signal at a location near the downhole location is measured (Brackel 2016; Brooks 2015; Reckmann 2008, 2014). The filtering process uses the time delay between first and third signals to estimate the two signal cross-correlation (Reckmann 2014). In this method, the derived filter estimates the transfer function of the communication channel between the pressure sensor locations proximate to the mud pump noise source signals. The digital <b>pump</b> <b>stroke</b> is used to generate pump noise signal source at a sampling rate that {{is less than the}} selected receiver signal (Brackel 2016). This technique is complex as it is difficult to estimate accurately the phase difference required to give quantifiable time delay between the pump sensor and pressure sensor signals.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this article, a {{systematic}} design method on an ionic polymer–metal composite (IPMC) -driven zero-net-mass-flux (ZNMF) pump is introduced for the flow control on a micro air vehicle’s (MAV) wing. Since IPMC can generate a large deformation under a low input voltage {{along with its}} ability to operate in air, and its easier manufacture in a small size, it {{is considered to be}} an ideal material for the actuating diaphragm. Several parametric studies, using numerical methods, were performed to find an optimal shape of the diaphragm in order to maximize the stroke volume. Through these parametric studies, electrode shapes and pressure effects on the stroke volume were investigated. It was also found that the resonance of the normal mode analysis of the optimal circle-shaped diaphragm would not affect the stroke volume because the computed fundamental frequency is much higher than the considered driving frequency range (40 Hz). Based on the optimal circle-shaped diaphragm, a prototype ZNMF pump, with a slot, is designed for the flow control on an MAV wing. By using the flight speed of the MAV considered in this work and the flow velocity through the pump’s slot, the calculated non-dimensional frequency and the momentum coefficient ensure the feasibility of the designed ZNMF pump as a flow control device.
