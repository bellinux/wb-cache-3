5|$|At lower Reynolds numbers, such {{as those}} seen with model aircraft, it is {{relatively}} easy to maintain laminar flow. This gives low skin friction, which is desirable. However, the same velocity profile which gives the laminar boundary layer its low skin friction also causes it to be badly affected by adverse pressure gradients. As the pressure begins to recover over the rear part of the wing chord, a laminar boundary layer will tend to separate from the surface. Such flow separation causes a large increase in the pressure drag, since it greatly increases the effective size of the wing section. In these cases, it can be advantageous to deliberately trip the boundary layer into turbulence at a point prior to the location of laminar separation, using a turbulator. The fuller velocity profile of the turbulent boundary layer allows it to sustain the adverse pressure gradient without separating. Thus, although the skin friction is increased, overall drag is decreased. This is the principle behind the dimpling on golf balls, as well as vortex generators on aircraft. Special wing sections have also been designed which tailor the <b>pressure</b> <b>recovery</b> so laminar separation is reduced or even eliminated. This represents an optimum compromise between the pressure drag from flow separation and skin friction from induced turbulence.|$|E

Subsonic <b>pressure</b> <b>recovery</b> {{is addressed}} by removal of the boundary layer (at the ramp bleed slot) and suitable shaping of the subsonic diffuser leading to the engine.

25|$|As flight speed {{increases}} supersonically {{the shock}} system is initially external. For the SR-71 this was until about M1.6 to M1.8 and M2 for the XB-70. The intake {{is said to}} be unstarted. Further increase in speed produces supersonic speeds inside the duct with a plane shock near the throat. The intake {{is said to be}} started. Upstream or downstream disturbances, such as gusts/atmospheric temperature gradients and engine airflow changes, both intentional and unintentional(from surging), tend to cause the shock to be expelled almost instantaneously. Expulsion of the shock, known as an unstart, causes all the supersonic compression to take place externally through a single plane shock. The intake has changed in a split second from its most efficient configuration with most of its supersonic compression taking place inside the duct to the least efficient as shown by the large loss in <b>pressure</b> <b>recovery,</b> from about 80% to about 20% at M3 flight speeds. There is a large drop in intake pressure and loss in thrust together with temporary loss of control of the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Both early {{accidents}} {{were originally}} attributed to pilot error, as over-rotation {{had led to}} a loss of lift from {{the leading edge of the}} aircraft's wings. It was later determined that the Comet's wing profile experienced a loss of lift at a high angle of attack, and its engine inlets also suffered a lack of <b>pressure</b> <b>recovery</b> in the same conditions. As a result, de Havilland re-profiled the wings' leading edge with a pronounced [...] "droop", and wing fences were added to control spanwise flow. A fictionalised investigation into the Comet's takeoff accidents was the subject of the 1959 novel Cone of Silence by Arthur David Beaty, a former BOAC captain. Cone of Silence was made into a film in 1960, and Beaty also recounted the story of the Comet's takeoff accidents in a chapter of his 1984 non-fiction work, Strange Encounters: Mysteries of the Air.|$|E

2500|$|The Concorde's {{variable}} geometry intake, {{designed by}} BAC, like any jet engine intake, has {{to deliver the}} air to the engine at as high [...] pressure as possible (<b>pressure</b> <b>recovery)</b> and with a pressure distribution [...] (distortion) that can be tolerated by the compressor. Poor <b>pressure</b> <b>recovery</b> is an unacceptable loss for the intake compression process and unacceptable distortion causes engine surging (from loss of surge margin). If the engine is an afterburning turbojet the intake also has to supply cooling air for the hot afterburner duct and engine nozzle. Meeting all the above requirements over the relevant parts of the operating envelope was vital for Concorde to become a viable commercial aircraft. They were met with variable geometry and an intake control system that did not compromise {{the operation of the}} engine nor the control of the aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|Cavitation is {{an event}} {{that can lead to}} MHV failure. While this has been a {{relatively}} rare occurrence, in 1988 the Edwards-Duramedics bileaflet had 46 reported failures in 20,000 implants related to cavitation damage. Since then, manufacturers have made cavitation testing {{an essential part of the}} design verification process. [...] Cavitation is the rapid formation of vaporous microbubbles in the fluid due to a local drop of pressure below the vaporization pressure at a given temperature. When conditions for cavitation are present bubbles will form and at the time of <b>pressure</b> <b>recovery</b> they will collapse or implode. This event will cause pressure or thermal shockwaves and fluid microjets which can damage a surface. These thermodynamic conditions are known to be the cause of MHV related erosion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{requirements}} {{from the}} Swedish Air Force dictated Mach 2 capability at high altitude and Mach 1 at low altitude. At the same time, short-field take-off and landing performance was also required. [...] Since the Viggen was developed initially {{as an attack}} aircraft instead of an interceptor (the Saab 35 Draken fulfilled this role), some emphasis was given to low fuel consumption at high subsonic speeds at low level for good range. With turbofan engines just emerging and indicating better fuel economy for cruise than turbojet engines, the former was favoured, since the latter were mainly limited by metallurgy development resulting from limitations in turbine temperature. Mechanical simplicity was also favoured, so the air intakes were simple D-section types with boundary layer splitter plates, while the fixed inlet had no adjustable geometry for improved <b>pressure</b> <b>recovery.</b> The disadvantage was that the required engine would be very large. In fact, {{at the time of}} introduction, it was the second largest fighter engine, with a length of 6.1m and 1.35m diameter; only the Tumansky R-15 was bigger.|$|E

40|$|AbstractãTo find optimum {{parameters}} of a bistable wall attachment amplifier having higher <b>recovery</b> <b>pressure,</b> an experimental research {{is performed using}} devices with {{two different types of}} splitter. Devices with a wedge type splitter(1),(3) are not so good for obtaining higher <b>recovery</b> <b>pressure</b> because of mixing reattached flow with surrounding fluid in the output duct. For avoiding this phenomenon and getting higher <b>recovery</b> <b>pressure,</b> devices with a pentagonal splitter(2),(4) was originated so as to obtain the optimum output duct width free from the position of the splitter tip. As compared with devices with the wedge type splitter, the remarkable merits of devices with the pentagonal splitter are observed. The <b>recovery</b> <b>pressure</b> gaind by closing the output duct is in most cases less 45 % of the supply for devices with the wedge type splitter, but over 45 % for devices with the pentagonal splitter. ããå´å£ä»çåï¼å®å®ç´ å­ã®è¨­è¨ã«ã¯æ°å¤ãã®å¤æ°ããã£ã¦ï¼ãã®è¨­è¨åºæºãå®ããã®ã¯éå¸¸ã«å°é£ã§ãããæ¬å ±ã§ã¯é«ãåå¾©å§ãå¾ããã¨ãç®çã¨ãã¦ï¼ã¹ããªãã¿ã®å½¢ãæ¥å½¢ã¨é§å½¢ã® 2 éãã«å¤ãï¼ãã®åãã«å¯¾ãã¦ãã³ãä½ç½®ï¼ã¹ããªãã¿è§ãå¤ãã¦å®é¨ãè¡ãªã£ããããæ¥å½¢ã®ã¹ããªãã¿ãæã¤ç´ å­ã¯ï¼åºåç«¯ã§åä»çæµã¨ã¾ããã®æµä¼ã¨ãæ··ãåãããã«ä¸è¬çã«é«ãåå¾©å§ãå¾ããé£ããã¨ãããé§å½¢ã®ã¹ããªãã¿ãæã¤ç´ å­ã¯ï¼æ¥å½¢ã®ã¹ããªãã¿ãæã¤ç´ å­ãèµ·ãä¸è¨ã®ãããªç¾è±¡ã¯ãªãï¼ä¸è¨ã«ç¤ºããããªèããå©ç¹ãã¿ããããã(1) ã¹ããªãã¿ã®ä½ç½®ã«é¢ä¿ãªãåºã«ãã¯ãå·¾ãä¸å®ã«ã§ããã®ã§ï¼çµ±ä¸çãªå®é¨ãè¡ãªãããã(2) åå¾©å§ãéå¸¸ã«é«ãï¼æ¥å½¢ã®å ´åã¯ 45 %ä»¥ä¸,é§å½¢ã®å ´åã» 45 %ä»¥ä¸ï¼ãã(3) ã¡ã¢ãªã¿ã¤ãã®ç´ å­ãå¤ãå¾ããããããåï¼ãã³ãã«é¢ãã¦ã¯ï¼ 3 æ¬¡åæ¹åã«ãã³ããéããå ´åã«ã¯ï¼è£½ä½ãå®¹æã§ããããå©ç¹ããããï¼ç©éã­ã¦ä½¿ç¨ãããã¨ãã§ããªãï¼åå¾©å§ãä½ãã¡ã¢ãªã¿ã¤ãã®ç´ å­ãå°ãªããªã©ã®æ¬ ç¹ãå¤ããã¨ããï¼ãã³ãã¯ 2 æ¬¡åæ¹åã«éããã®ãæã¾ããã¨ãããã¨ãããã£ã...|$|R
