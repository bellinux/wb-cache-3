25|$|Leagues {{can have}} various formats. While most leagues are mixed leagues, {{containing}} {{both men and}} women, men's and women's leagues are still common, along with junior leagues for young bowlers.

25|$|Intel has {{developed}} a successor to its Low <b>Pin</b> <b>Count</b> (LPC) bus that it calls the Enhanced Serial Peripheral Interface Bus, or eSPI for short. Intel aims to allow {{the reduction in the}} number of pins required on motherboards compared to systems using LPC, have more available throughput than LPC, reduce the working voltage to 1.8 volts to facilitate smaller chip manufacturing processes, allow eSPI peripherals to share SPI flash devices with the host (the LPC bus did not allow firmware hubs to be used by LPC peripherals), tunnel previous out-of-band pins through the eSPI bus, and allow system designers to trade off cost and performance.|$|E
2500|$|Spare: A [...] "spare" [...] {{is awarded}} when no pins are left {{standing}} {{after the second}} ball of a frame; i.e., a player uses both balls of a frame to clear all ten pins. A player achieving a spare is awarded ten pins, plus a bonus of whatever is scored with the next ball (only the first ball is counted).

50|$|One popular 6502 based computer, the Commodore 64, used a {{modified}} 6502 CPU, the 6510. Unlike the 6503 - 6505 and 6507, the 6510 is a 40-pin chip that adds internal hardware: an 8-bit parallel I/O port mapped to addresses 0000 and 0001. The 6508 is another chip that, like the 6510, adds internal hardware: 256 bytes of SRAM {{and the same}} 8-bit I/O port featured by the 6510. Though these chips do not have reduced <b>pin</b> <b>counts</b> compared to the 6502, they need 8 new pins for the added parallel I/O port. In this case, no address lines are among the 8 removed pins.|$|R
50|$|Some {{very early}} {{computers}} also had CPUs {{with fewer than}} 16 address pins: The MOS Technology 6507 (a reduced <b>pin</b> <b>count</b> version of the 6502) {{was used in the}} Atari 2600 and was limited to a 13 line address bus.|$|E
50|$|Operation of a {{parallel}} EEPROM {{is simple and}} fast when compared to serial EEPROM, but these devices are larger due to the higher <b>pin</b> <b>count</b> (28 pins or more) and have been decreasing in popularity in favor of serial EEPROM or flash.|$|E
50|$|The code {{space is}} {{generally}} implemented as on-chip ROM, EPROM or flash ROM. In general, {{there is no}} provision for storing code in external memory {{due to the lack}} of an external memory interface. The exceptions are PIC17 and select high <b>pin</b> <b>count</b> PIC18 devices.|$|E
50|$|A normal {{integrated}} circuit (IC) socket requires the IC {{to be pushed}} into sprung contacts which then grip by friction. For an IC with hundreds of pins, the total insertion force can be very large (hundreds of newtons), leading to a danger of damage to the device or the circuit board. Also, even with relatively small <b>pin</b> <b>counts,</b> each <b>pin</b> extraction is fairly awkward and carries a significant risk of bending pins, particularly if the person performing the extraction hasn't had much practice or if the board is crowded. Low insertion force (LIF) sockets reduce the issues of insertion and extraction, but because of its lower insertion force than a conventional socket, are likely to produce less reliable connections.|$|R
50|$|The quad flat-pack has {{connections}} {{only around}} {{the periphery of}} the package. To increase the number of pins, the spacing was decreased from 50 mil (thousandths of an inch) (as found on small outline packages) to 20 and later 12 mil (1.27 mm, 0.51mm and 0.30mm respectively). However, this close lead spacing made solder bridges more likely and put higher demands on the soldering process and alignment of parts during assembly. The later pin grid array and ball grid array packages, by allowing connections to be made over the area of the package and not just around the edges, allowed for higher <b>pin</b> <b>counts</b> with similar package sizes, and reduced the problems with close lead spacing.|$|R
40|$|Packages {{for high}} <b>pin</b> <b>counts</b> using the {{ball grid array}} {{technology}} or its miniaturized version, the chip scale package, inherently require reliability concepts {{as an integral part}} of their development. This is especially true for the latter packages, if they are combined with the flip chip technology. Accordingly, thermal fatigue of the solder balls is frequently investigated by means of the finite element method. Various modeling assumptions and simplifications are common to restrict the calculation effort. Some of them, like geometric modeling assumptions, assumptions concerning the homogeneity of the cyclic temperature fields, simplified creep characterization of solder, and the related application of Manson-Coffin failure criteria, are discussed in the paper. The packages chosen for detailed analyses are a PBGA 272 and a FC-CSP 230...|$|R
