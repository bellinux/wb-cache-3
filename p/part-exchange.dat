25|$|McPherson was ever-present for {{the first}} 23 games of the 1929–30 season, and by 26 December, he had scored 22 of Watford's 29 total goals up to that point; Arthur Woodward (2) {{was the only other}} player to have scored more than once. The match against Torquay United on 28 December was McPherson's first absence of the season. He made eight more {{appearances}} after his return, scoring three goals, before he was sold to Reading in February 1930 for a fee of £1,500 and George James in <b>part-exchange.</b>|$|E
25|$|In May 2008, Liverpool made {{a series}} of bids to buy Barry, all of which were {{rejected}} by Aston Villa. Barry publicly criticised his manager, Martin O'Neill, accusing him of making no attempt to keep him at the club, and further stating a desire to join Liverpool in order to compete in the Champions League. O'Neill denied this claim and Barry was officially disciplined for giving an unauthorised interview. A further bid from Liverpool of around £15 million was rejected as it was still short of Villa's £18 million asking price. Steve Finnan had then been offered in <b>part-exchange</b> in the deal, but the fee Villa wanted in this case was understood by BBC Sport to be £17 million with Finnan included. Barry was then stripped of the team captaincy, fined two weeks' wages and banned from training with the Villa squad.|$|E
25|$|Their Fairs Cup run, {{taking in}} wins over Roma (a violent encounter, {{during which the}} Chelsea team coach was ambushed by Roma fans), 1860 Munich and Milan (the last on the toss of a coin after the teams had {{finished}} level), ended in a semi-final loss to Barcelona. Both home sides won 2–0 and on another coin toss, the replay was staged at the Camp Nou, with Barça winning 5–0. Docherty, his relationship with several players having reached breaking point, then {{made the decision to}} break up a team with an average age of 21. Venables, Graham, Bridges and Murray were all sold during the close-season. Scottish winger Charlie Cooke joined for £72,000, as did striker Tommy Baldwin, who arrived in <b>part-exchange</b> for Graham. Also emerging from the youth set-up was a highly rated teenage striker named Peter Osgood.|$|E
50|$|Seeley {{entered his}} first race in 1954 at Brands Hatch, a one-hour {{endurance}} event, riding a solo 500 cc BSA Star Twin borrowed from a friend, where he completed 42 laps during the hour. Pressure of work prevented any further competition until 1957 when Seeley entered his first scramble on a <b>part-exchanged</b> Triumph twin, followed by grass track, hill climb and Ramsgate sprint {{using the same}} machine.|$|R
5000|$|Jackson {{began his}} career as an amateur with Arsenal, before he made 38 {{appearances}} in the Third Division South for Alec Stock's Leyton Orient in the 1950-51 season. He impressed in his creative performances at Brisbane Road, enough so that Liverpool manager Don Welsh paid £6,500 and <b>part-exchanged</b> Don Woan to bring the 18-year-old to the club in November 1951. He made his debut on 10 November 1951 at Anfield in a league match against Bolton Wanderers; Jackson's first goal for the club in the 61st minute was enough for the [...] "Reds" [...] to get a point from a 1-1 draw. He went on to tally up 15 First Division appearances in the 1951-52 season. However, he never really established himself in the Liverpool side, and featured only five times in the 1952-53 campaign. He scored four goals in 28 games in 1953-54, as Liverpool suffered relegation. He featured in 23 Second Division games in the 1954-55 campaign, before posting 15 appearances in 1955-56 and 19 appearances in 1956-57, as Liverpool twice finished in third place. He played 24 games in the 1957-58 campaign, as Phil Taylor's side finished two points short of promotion. His stay at Liverpool lasted for {{six and a half years}} and he managed 133 senior appearances, mostly in his preferred outside right position, never really establishing himself as a first team regular.|$|R
25|$|However, during Cannavaro's spell {{with the}} club, Inter mostly flattered to deceive. His stint {{with the club}} began promisingly, as Inter reached the semi-finals of the 2002–03 Champions League and also {{finished}} runners-up in Serie A to Juventus {{in his first season}} with the club. However, his second season was not as productive, and he missed a large chunk of it through injury. He was also often played out of position. Inter finished fourth in Serie A and reached the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia, losing out to Juventus on penalties. Inter finished third in their Champions League group, but would go on to reach the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. After two years with the club, he was sold to Juventus in a surprising <b>part-exchange</b> deal, after just over 50 appearances and two goals. After he left Italy, Cannavaro often spoke negatively of his spell at Inter, comparing the club unfavourably with his other Italian clubs, Parma and Juventus.|$|E
500|$|Injuries to Kay and Lemon {{hindered}} Sunderland at {{the start}} of 1988–89, and they took until 1 October 1988 to register their first win back in the Second Division. He signed burly striker Billy Whitehurst to act as a [...] "battering-ram", who proved to be an effective player despite being a heavy binge drinker. He spent a club record £500,000 on goalkeeper Tony Norman, though Hesford and Whitehurst were traded as <b>part-exchange</b> on the fee. Sunderland improved and ended the season in 11th-place.|$|E
500|$|In March 1970, Greaves joined West Ham United as <b>part-exchange</b> in Martin Peters' {{transfer}} to White Hart Lane. Brian Clough's Derby County {{had also been}} interested in Greaves, {{but he did not}} want to move away from London. In hindsight Greaves felt that Clough might have helped him revive his career, as he had done for Greaves' former Tottenham teammate Dave Mackay. Greaves later admitted his regret in making the move to Upton Park. He scored two goals on his [...] "Hammers" [...] debut on 21 March, in a 5–1 win against Manchester City at Maine Road.|$|E
500|$|Revie {{was sold}} to First Division side Manchester City for £25,000 (including a <b>part-exchange</b> for Ernie Phillips, valued at £12,000) in October 1951. The Citizens {{struggled}} in the 1951–52 season, {{and then went on}} to finish just one place above the relegation zone in the 1952–53 campaign. Revie was often isolated {{from the rest of the}} team due to his lack of pace. The sale of Ivor Broadis then allowed Revie to drop deeper down the field, and allowed manager Les McDowall to put Revie in what eventually proved to be a pivotal role, introducing to English football the position of deep-lying centre forward. This evolved into the so-called [...] "Revie Plan", with Revie as the central figure. His role derived from the more traditional inside right position, and was based on the style of the successful Hungarian national team, and in particular Nándor Hidegkuti, who invented the role. Revie devoted 20 pages to analysing and explaining the plan in his autobiography Soccer's Happy Wanderer written in 1955.|$|E
500|$|Ramsey's {{opinion that}} Dodgin had treated him unfairly was {{not shared by}} the other Southampton players, who {{respected}} Ellerington as a player of comparable ability. According to the wing-half Joe Mallett, Ramsey was also motivated to leave by a dressing-room row with his captain Bill Rochford at half-time during that final League match against Sheffield Wednesday: one of the Sheffield Wednesday goals was blamed on Ramsey's failure to play an opposing winger offside. The Southampton chairman and board tried to persuade Ramsey to stay, but his mind was made up—he told them that if {{he played in the}} reserve team it would hinder his chances of playing internationally. Liverpool, Luton Town and Burnley were among the clubs who expressed interest in buying him but {{by the time of the}} transfer deadline on 16 March only Sheffield Wednesday had made a concrete bid. Tottenham Hotspur came in with a last-minute offer, but there was no time for the transfer to go through, and Ramsey was forced to stay at Southampton for the rest of the season. [...] On 15 May 1949 the new Tottenham manager Arthur Rowe revived the offer, and signed Ramsey in a <b>part-exchange</b> deal for £4,500 and Wales international winger Ernie Jones—the transfer was widely reported as being worth £21,000, then a record for Tottenham.|$|E
2500|$|New faces {{included}} goalkeepers John [...] "Budgie" [...] Burridge and George Wood, Chris Simpkin and Dave Lennard, {{and finally}} Keith Dyson. Dyson {{came in a}} <b>part-exchange</b> deal that took Tony Green to Tyneside and boosted Blackpool's finances {{to the tune of}} ₤150,000.|$|E
2500|$|One of these, a 34 piece silver-gilt English toilet service made in 1708, and {{presented}} {{by her father}} to Maria Howard, Duchess of Norfolk on her marriage was granted an export license from the UK to Australia in 2012, despite objections by the Victoria and Albert Museum. Having cost around £700 in 1708, paid in installments, it was sold for £1,380,000 in 2012. It {{was made by the}} leading London silversmith Benjamin Pyne in the [...] "plain English" [...] style, as opposed to the French style used by Huguenot makers. [...] It had been bought by the London jewellers Rundell, Bridge & Rundell as <b>part-exchange</b> for a new dinner service for the Duke of Norfolk in the early 19th century, and they it sold to William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale, adding his cypher [...] "discreetly".|$|E
2500|$|Goodwin had {{converted}} the attractive but inconsistent football of Cullis's teams to a skilful, aggressive game capable of drawing crowds– average home league attendance rose to over 32,000– and maintaining top-flight status. Yet five years later, the Birmingham Mail sports editor, Dennis Shaw, wrote what a colleague {{described as a}} [...] "a dossier of despair on the wasted seventies at St Andrew's. It was a chronicle of lack of achievement, sales of star players and unsuccessful replacements, growing disenchantment among the fans." [...] Seven wins and a draw {{in the last eight}} matches took Birmingham to a mid-table finish in 1972–73, but by February 1974, the team lay 20th, the club needed to raise money, and Latchford was sold to Everton in a <b>part-exchange</b> deal: £80,000 cash plus players Howard Kendall and Archie Styles, valued at a British record fee of £350,000. Without a goalscorer of that quality, the team struggled, but they avoided relegation, and stayed up again in 1974–75, as well as reaching another FA Cup semi-final. This time they lost to Second Division Fulham in a replay when, in the last seconds of extra time, a goalkeeping clearance rebounded off a Fulham player and trickled over the line.|$|E
2500|$|Before the 1996–97 season began, Cole had to {{deal with}} being offered to Blackburn Rovers as <b>part-exchange</b> in a £12million deal that would have brought Alan Shearer to Old Trafford, but the offer was {{rejected}} and Shearer joined Newcastle instead. Despite Alex Ferguson's clear indication to Cole that he was looking for another striker, after the Shearer deal fell through, Cole fought to stay at the club and was handed the number 9 shirt, having previously worn 17,. The arrival of Ole Gunnar Solskjær – and being the victim of two broken legs suffered after a tackle by Neil Ruddock in a reserve match against Liverpool, restricted Cole's first-team chances further. However, he managed to recover by December that year and still played in 20 Premier League matches (ten as a substitute) for the season. Cole then ended the season strongly with several crucial goals in both the league (such as away at title rivals Arsenal), and in the UEFA Champions League (where he scored a goal voted the season's best European goal against Porto) to complete his comeback from injury. Cole then scored the title sealing goal in a landmark 3–1 win for United at Anfield – the scene of his broken legs just half a season earlier – against Roy Evans' [...] "Spice Boys" [...] Liverpool team and thereby aiding United in winning their fourth title in five years, with Cole winning another Premier League title medal.|$|E

50|$|After {{hostilities}} ended {{he played}} 12 {{times in the}} 1946-47 season, but was sold to Southampton in <b>part-exchange</b> for Don Roper in summer 1947; in all he played 14 times for the Gunners, never scoring.|$|E

50|$|As {{a player}} with a {{background}} in Denizlispor for 4 seasons, in Fenerbahçe S.K. for 2 seasons and in many other Anatolian squads including Ankaraspor, Bursaspor, Yusuf's transition to Beşiktaş J.K. stirred the football community. It was claimed that Trabzonspor made a proposal for Yusuf long before Beşiktaş did, and further that both Bursaspor and Yusuf himself accepted the formal offer that Trabzonspor made. However, that claim was not verified. Actually, Trabzonspor's offer included a <b>part-exchange</b> deal sending Adnan Güngör to Bursaspor; but the deal went off when Adnan refused to exchange teams. Then after Mustafa Denizli's persistence for an efficient playmaker, Yusuf was transferred to Beşiktaş J.K., for a <b>part-exchange</b> deal including Tuna Üzümcü plus 400k euro.|$|E
50|$|In February 1974, {{by which}} time he had already scored 18 goals for Birmingham, centre-forward Bob Latchford signed for Everton in <b>part-exchange</b> for Howard Kendall, Archie Styles, and £80,000. The whole package was valued at a British record {{transfer}} fee of £350,000.|$|E
