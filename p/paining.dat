40|$|This study {{determined}} preoperative {{predictors of}} movement and resting <b>pain</b> following total knee replacement (TKR). We hypothesized that younger patients with higher preoperative <b>pain</b> intensity, <b>pain</b> sensitivity, trait anxiety, <b>pain</b> catastrophizing, and depression {{would be more likely}} to experience higher postoperative movement <b>pain</b> than older patients with lower scores on these variables prior to surgery, and that predictors would be similar for resting <b>pain.</b> Demographics, analgesic intake, anxiety, depression, <b>pain</b> catastrophizing, resting <b>pain,</b> movement <b>pain</b> (ie, during active knee range of motion), and quantitative sensory tests were performed preoperatively on 215 participants scheduled for a unilateral TKR. On postoperative day 2, analgesic intake, resting <b>pain,</b> and movement <b>pain</b> were again assessed. Significant predictors of moderate or severe movement <b>pain</b> were higher preoperative movement <b>pain,</b> von Frey <b>pain</b> intensity, and heat <b>pain</b> threshold. People with severe movement <b>pain</b> preoperatively were 20 times more likely to have severe movement <b>pain</b> postoperatively. When the influence of preoperative movement <b>pain</b> was removed, depression became a predictor. Significant predictors of moderate to severe resting <b>pain</b> were higher preoperative resting <b>pain,</b> depression, and younger age. These results suggest that patients with higher preoperative <b>pain</b> and depression are more likely to have higher <b>pain</b> following TKR, and younger patients may have higher resting <b>pain.</b> Cutaneous <b>pain</b> sensitivity predicted movement <b>pain</b> but not resting <b>pain,</b> suggesting that mechanisms underlying movement <b>pain</b> are different from resting <b>pain.</b> Aggressive management of preoperative <b>pain,</b> <b>pain</b> sensitivity, and depression prior to surgery may facilitate postoperative recovery...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntroductionEvidence {{suggests}} that painful intercourse, pain-related psychosocial factors, and altered <b>pain</b> processing magnify the <b>pain</b> experience, {{but it is}} not clear how these factors are related to each other. AimThe aims were to (i) characterize differences between women with pelvic <b>pain</b> and pain-free women using a battery of pain-related psychosocial measures, clinical <b>pain</b> ratings, and evoked local and remote <b>pain</b> sensitivity; and (ii) examine the relationship between intercourse <b>pain,</b> clinical <b>pain,</b> and local and remote evoked <b>pain</b> sensitivity. MethodsWomen with pelvic <b>pain</b> lasting at least 3 months and pain-free women completed questionnaires and underwent <b>pain</b> sensitivity testing. Self-report measures included clinical <b>pain</b> intensity, <b>pain</b> catastrophizing, pain-related fear, <b>pain</b> anxiety, depression, sexual function, and self-efficacy. <b>Pain</b> sensitivity measures included threshold and tolerance and temporal summation of <b>pain.</b> Separate analyses of variance (anova) were used to test group differences in self-report and <b>pain</b> sensitivity measures. Correlations were calculated among dyspareunia, psychosocial factors, and evoked <b>pain.</b> Main Outcome MeasuresSelf-reported <b>pain</b> and <b>pain</b> sensitivity measures. ResultsTwenty-eight pain-free women and 14 women with pelvic <b>pain</b> participated in this study. Women with pelvic <b>pain</b> reported greater <b>pain</b> intensity and greater psychosocial involvement compared with pain-free women. No differences existed between groups for thermal or pressure measures, but women with pelvic <b>pain</b> rated their <b>pain</b> with <b>pain</b> testing significantly higher than pain-free women. Intercourse <b>pain</b> was significantly associated with affective and sensory <b>pain</b> and pressure <b>pain</b> ratings at the puborectalis, vulvar vestibule, adductor longus tendons, and tibialis anterior muscle.

A moderated mediation model revealed that the indirect effect of <b>pain</b> on disability through depressed mood is moderated by <b>pain</b> duration: while depressed mood did not mediate the effect of <b>pain</b> on disability in chronic <b>pain</b> patients with shorter <b>pain</b> duration, depressed mood significantly mediated the effect <b>pain</b> exerts on disability in chronic <b>pain</b> patients with longer <b>pain</b> duration. <b>Pain</b> duration did not moderate the direct effect of <b>pain</b> on disability.

40|$|<b>Pain</b> catastrophizing {{is known}} to {{contribute}} to physical and mental functioning, even when controlling for the effect of <b>pain</b> intensity. However, research has yet to explore whether {{the strength of the}} relationship between <b>pain</b> catastrophizing and painrelated outcomes varies across <b>pain</b> intensity levels (i. e., moderation). If this was the case, it would have important implications for existing models of <b>pain</b> and current interventions. The present investigation explored whether <b>pain</b> intensity moderates the relationship between <b>pain</b> catastrophizing and pain-related outcomes. Participants were 254 patients (62 % women) with heterogeneous chronic <b>pain.</b> Patients completed a measure of <b>pain</b> intensity, <b>pain</b> interference, <b>pain</b> catastrophizing, and physical and mental health. <b>Pain</b> intensity moderated the relationship between <b>pain</b> catastrophizing and <b>pain</b> interference and between <b>pain</b> catastrophizing and physical health status. Specifically, the strength of the correlation between <b>pain</b> catastrophizing and these outcomes decreased considerably as <b>pain</b> intensity increased. In contrast, <b>pain</b> intensity did not moderate the relationship between <b>pain</b> catastrophizing and mental health. Study findings provide a new insight into the role of <b>pain</b> intensity (i. e., moderator) in the relationship between <b>pain</b> catastrophizing and various pain-related outcomes, which might help develop existent models of <b>pain.</b> Clinical implications are discussed in the context of personalized therapy...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pain</b> {{is often}} a {{disabling}} symptom in Parkinson’s disease (PD), and is currently underassessed, underdiagnosed, and undertreated in this population of primarily older adults. Guided by the Rugh Model of Psychological Components of <b>Pain,</b> {{an exploration of the}} characteristics of <b>pain</b> experienced by individuals with PD, and the relationships among the emotional, cognitive, perceptual, and behavioral aspects of <b>pain</b> was undertaken. A convenience sample of 125 patients with PD reporting average daily <b>pain</b> as ≥ 2 on the Brief <b>Pain</b> Inventory-Short Form, were recruited for a cross-sectional descriptive survey from two large urban movement disorder centers. Multiple measures were used to assess PD symptoms, depression, attention, beliefs, <b>pain</b> severity, <b>pain</b> interference, quality of <b>pain,</b> and classification of <b>pain</b> symptoms. Multivariable data analyses included descriptive statistics, multiple regression analysis, and correlational techniques. Results demonstrated the strength of the Rugh Model for an examination of <b>pain</b> as a multidimensional experience in PD. Participants reported over two distinct <b>pain</b> symptoms each, with most symptoms classified as musculoskeletal <b>pain.</b> Additionally, most participants described <b>pain</b> as unrelated to idiopathic PD. Correlations with medium to large effect size supported the Rugh Model with significant relationships among <b>pain</b> severity, <b>pain</b> behavior, <b>pain</b> beliefs, depression, sensory quality of <b>pain,</b> and affective quality of <b>pain.</b> Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that 46 % of the variance in <b>Pain</b> Interference was explained by <b>pain</b> severity, depression, and <b>pain</b> beliefs. A significant contribution of the study was the use of the International Association for the Study of <b>Pain</b> scheme for coding chronic <b>pain</b> diagnosis modified with M. A. Lee’s classification of <b>pain</b> in PD. Intervention trials should integrate assessment for depression in concert with effective strategies for <b>pain</b> management.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although mirror <b>pain</b> occurs after cordotomy in {{patients}} experiencing unilateral <b>pain</b> via a referred <b>pain</b> mechanism, no {{studies have examined}} whether this <b>pain</b> mechanism operates {{in patients}} who have bilateral <b>pain.</b> OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of cordotomy for bilateral <b>pain</b> from the view-point of increased <b>pain</b> or new <b>pain</b> caused by a referred <b>pain</b> mechanism. METHODS: Twenty-six patients who underwent percutaneous cordotomy through C 1 -C 2 for severe bilateral cancer <b>pain</b> in the lumbosacral nerve region were enrolled. <b>Pain</b> was dominant on 1 side in 23 patients, and <b>pain</b> was equally severe on both sides in 3 patients. Unilateral cordotomy was performed for the dominant side of <b>pain,</b> and bilateral cordot-omy was performed for 13 patients in whom <b>pain</b> on the nondominant side developed or remained severe after cordotomy. RESULTS: After unilateral cordotomy, 19 patients (73. 1 %) exhibited increased <b>pain,</b> which for 14 patients was as severe as the original dominant <b>pain.</b> After bilateral cordotomy, 7 patients (53. 4 %) exhibited new <b>pain,</b> which was located cephalad to the region rendered analgesic by cordotomy and was better controlled than the original <b>pain.</b> No pathological organic causes of new <b>pain</b> were found in any patient, and evidence of a referred <b>pain</b> mechanism was found in 3 patients after bilateral cordotomy. CONCLUSION: These results show that a referred <b>pain</b> mechanism causes increased or new <b>pain</b> after cordotomy in patients with bilateral <b>pain.</b> Nevertheless, cordotomy can still be indicated for patients with bilateral <b>pain</b> because postoperative <b>pain</b> is better controlled than the original <b>pain...</b>|$|R

Preoperatively, 42 healthy males undergoing funnel chest surgery completed the Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Beck's Depression Inventory before undergoing a sequential conditioned <b>pain</b> modulation paradigm. Subsequently, the <b>Pain</b> Catastrophizing Scale was introduced and patients were instructed to reference the conditioning <b>pain</b> while answering.

Patients reporting persistent <b>pain</b> at six months follow-up (n =  15) were not significantly different from pain-free patients (n =  16) concerning preoperative conditioned <b>pain</b> modulation response (Z =  1. 0, P =  0. 3) or level of catastrophizing (Z =  0. 4, P =  1. 0). In the acute postoperative phase, situational <b>pain</b> catastrophizing predicted movement-evoked <b>pain,</b> independently of anxiety and depression (β =  1. 0, P =  0. 007) whereas conditioned <b>pain</b> modulation predicted morphine consumption (β = - 0. 005, P =  0. 001).
