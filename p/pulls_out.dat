The {{terrorist}} incident occurred at Kazuaki and Nageki's orphanage and left them as the only survivors; witnessing Nageki's subsequent suicide drove Kazuaki insane, leading him to fake his own death, assume a new identity, and join the school's faculty to take revenge against Shuu, the head of Operation Hatoful. Ryouta, channeling Nageki, eases Kazuaki's guilt and convinces him to move on.|$|E

The musical program for the screenings were decided and played by the individual accompanists.

The suggestion was {{to begin with a}} waltz until the friend pats the artist on the shoulder, when All I Get is Sympathy is played. The suggestion for I Don't Know Where I'm Going completes the scene and Life's A Funny Proposition follows the artist packing up until the artist <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> the gun.

5000|$|My {{question}} {{for all the}} candidates: How do we <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> now? And the follow-up, are we watching the same blankin' war? I certainly wasn't {{a big fan of}} the invasion/liberation. It sickens me to hear about soldiers wounded and getting killed daily, not to mention innocent Iraqis, but how do we <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> now? The government's shaky; bombs daily. Don't you think if we <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> now that would open it up for Iran and Syria, God knows who—Russia—how do we <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> now? And isn't it our responsibility to get these people up on their feet? I mean, do you leave a newborn baby to take care of himself? How do we <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> now?

5|$|Female {{cats are}} {{seasonally}} polyestrous, {{which means they}} may have many periods of heat {{over the course of}} a year, the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn. Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last about 4 to 7 days. Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backwards-pointing penile spines, which are about 1mm long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which acts to induce ovulation. This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance of conception.|$|E
5|$|The Resistance use {{the nuclear}} codes and the Spindly Torque {{to mount an}} assault on Deathshead's compound. Rescuing the {{captured}} resistance prisoners and evacuating them, Blazkowicz {{makes it to the}} top of the tower, struggling to Deathshead's workshop. Inside, Deathshead greets Blazkowicz, revealing to him that he possesses the brain of the soldier that Blazkowicz chose to die, and puts it in a robot. The robot comes alive and assaults Blazkowicz, who defeats it and puts his friend to rest by destroying the brain. Commandeering a larger robot mecha, Deathshead then attacks Blazkowicz, who gets the upper hand and destroys the robot, dragging Deathshead out of it. He repeatedly stabs Deathshead, who <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> a grenade which explodes, killing Deathshead and mauling Blazkowicz. As a gravely wounded Blazkowicz crawls towards a window, he mentally recites The New Colossus as he watches the Resistance survivors boarding a helicopter, alongside Anya and Set. Seeing that they have reached safety, and bleeding heavily from his injuries, Blazkowicz orders the Resistance to fire the nuclear cannon. After the credits, a helicopter is heard approaching.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} the office learn that Dunder Mifflin is in {{financial}} trouble. In {{an attempt to get}} the worried staff under control, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Jim call a meeting to provide optimistic viewpoints, despite the steadily worsening news. In a moment of quick thinking, Michael <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> a murder mystery party game called Belles, Bourbon, and Bullets and forces the rest of the staff to play along. The staff slowly warms up to the game. It is set in Savannah, Georgia, and everyone has to adopt a Southern accent. Thanks to Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), and Phyllis Lapin-Vance (Phyllis Smith), the game becomes a hit. Everyone present starts to play along, except for Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) who tries to get updates on the situation from corporate and Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) who shows up late to work and flees after being told he is a suspect in a murder. Jim, however, believes that the entire exercise is pointless.|$|E

5|$|The video starts {{showing a}} woman {{galloping}} through a snowy forest on horseback. She enters a warehouse where a cage surrounded by crows is suspended by chains. Nearby {{there is a}} trapped short-haired woman with a flayed face and crow-like eyes. The first woman stops under the cage {{and looks up at}} it. She casts a stone against a wall that reflects her like a mirror and the building collapses. In the snow, she finds a body—the second woman, inanimate and frozen—hidden under a blanket. She closes her eyes, plunges her hands into the body and <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> a sword. Entering the forest, she sees numerous flying crows and ends up on a snowy plain on which there are erected many scarecrows. During the refrains, she uses her sword to destroy scarecrows, rip their sails and break the wooden crosses. Scarecrows' eyes weep black blood that turns to crows. Then, it is shown how the other woman was killed: the big peaks which covered the ceiling of her cage had gradually collapsed on her. Finally, the living woman plants her sword in the snow, then disappears into the air. Farmer plays the role of both women.|$|E
5|$|When Lincoln {{finds that}} the camera has not {{detected}} any motion, the group sets out into the forest once more. Wendy is dragged away by the shark and killed. The shark attacks Cameron, and Chapman shoots {{him in the head}} to end his pain. Hoffman and Mike soon join up with Chapman and Lincoln. Hoffman plans to start a large fire to attract the shark, as he surmises that the heat will confuse it, but it kills him before he can drop a lighter.

The shark reappears and attempts to kill Mike, but he pulls the grenade's pin, causing them both to explode.

Later, a woman named Daphne approaches Ethan's grave to lay a wreath, and a shark fin approaches her as she walks out of the graveyard.|$|E

Yazoo and Loz are apparently destroyed along the way by an explosive planted by Shinra's agents. Cloud chases Kadaj down and engages him in battle, ultimately subduing him. Outmatched, Kadaj opens Jenova's box and fuses with its contents, transforming into Sephiroth. He then tells Cloud {{that he will be}} able to use the life essences of Geostigma sufferers to achieve complete domination over the planet. He and Cloud then fight, and throughout the whole encounter, Sephiroth appears to have the upper hand, flinging Cloud repeatedly into walls and finally impaling him through the shoulder. He asks Cloud to tell him what he most cherishes so that he can have the pleasure of taking it away. To this, Cloud replies that he cherishes everything, then <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> Sephiroth's sword and deals him a hail of devastating blows. Sephiroth's spirit departs, leaving behind the mortally wounded Kadaj. As he lies dying in Cloud's arms, a healing rain starts falling across the land, curing the people of their Geostigma. Yazoo and Loz appear and confront Cloud; he charges at them, and they set off a massive explosion engulfing the three.|$|E
