5|$|In {{the scene}} when Homer, Bart and Lisa pick up Maggie from the daycare center, babies are perched {{all over the}} building, staring at the family and quietly sucking on pacifiers. This is a spoof of the final shot of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds. Indeed, a cartoon-version of Hitchcock can be seen walking his dogs past the daycare, a {{reference}} to his own cameo appearance in the film. The episode also contains an allusion to the opera scene in Citizen Kane, in which Homer plays with a shredded <b>playbill</b> while he watches {{his wife in the}} musical.|$|E
5|$|The {{dancing is}} {{restrained}} {{with a single}} prop: that of a solitary chair. At {{one point in the}} first segment of the video, she is filmed dancing but the camera is almost still and the motions of the dance are confined within the small range of the camera. As the screens inside the viewing booths open and close, the camera slices the shots of Madonna each with its own angle and duration. The same imagery is exhibited by the little boy outside who tries to frame Madonna's <b>playbill</b> image into different angles. There are four other men in the booths who are made of wood with paintings of artist Tamara de Lempicka on them. Madonna at one point takes off her gloves like Rita Hayworth in Gilda and points towards one of the wooden paintings. It collapses and she blows on her finger.|$|E

Brower took up the playing of the bones, making {{him one of the}} {{earliest}} to marry the instrument with blackface theater. The following season, Brower and Emmett toured with Raymond and Waring's Circus. The duo became well known, and Brower earned a reputation as a first-tier dancer. Brower's introduction of acrobatic leaps to the stage caught on with other blackface performers. His act was well enough known that Master Juba (William Henry Lane) did an impression of Brower dancing (an 1845 <b>playbill</b> for the Ethiopian Minstrels, with whom Juba was touring, lists Brower as the fifth ranked dancer in Juba's show).|$|E

500|$|In December 1842 and January 1843, Dan Emmett {{portrayed the}} {{character}} Old Dan Tucker in solo and duo performances; the playbills do not indicate whether he included {{the song in}} his act. The Virginia Minstrels probably made [...] "Old Dan Tucker" [...] {{a regular part of}} their show beginning with their first performance at the Bowery Amphitheatre on February 6, 1843. Their minstrel show also included a comic scene loosely based on the song, [...] "Dan Tucker on Horseback", about a black riding master. The piece starred Richard Pelham in the title role and Frank Brower as a black clown. [...] "Old Dan Tucker" [...] did not appear on a Virginia Minstrels <b>playbill</b> until a March 7 and 8 performance at Boston's Masonic Temple.

500|$|The {{play was}} revived in 1872 at the Court Theatre, in 1873 at the Queen's Theatre, and in 1874 at the Vaudeville Theatre (running for over 100 performances), all in London. It {{appears to have}} gone through several changes during these revivals, {{the first of which}} was {{described}} on its <b>playbill</b> as a [...] "shortened version", and the last as an [...] "altered" [...] one. Various versions continued to be produced into the 20thcentury by amateurs as well as occasional professional groups, such as Ben Greet's Elizabethan Stage Society of England. An acting edition was published by T. H. Lacy around 1871. T. H. Lacy was acquired by Samuel French, and the libretto continued to be printed until about 1970. The piece, still occasionally produced, was part of the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival in 2006.|$|E
500|$|She next {{starred in}} the musical {{adaptation}} of Neil Simon's The Goodbye Girl with music by Marvin Hamlisch (1993). Peters won her second Tony for Best Leading Actress in a Musical for her performance as Annie Oakley in the 1999 Broadway revival of Annie Get Your Gun. Among many glowing notices, critic Lloyd Rose of the Washington Post commented: [...] " [...] banishes all thoughts of Ethel Merman about two bars into her first number, 'Doin' What Comes Natur'lly.' Partly this is because Merman's Annie was a hearty, boisterous gal, while Peters plays an adorable, slightly goofy gamine. ... For anyone {{who cares about the}} American musical theater, the chance to see Peters in this role is reason enough to see the show." [...] <b>Playbill</b> went even further: [...] "Arguably the most talented comedienne in the musical theatre today, Peters manages to extract a laugh from most every line she delivers." ...|$|E
500|$|Adam Hetrick, {{editor-in-chief}} of Playbill.com, described Fun Home as [...] "the best musical of the year", calling it [...] "an emotionally-packed piece of theatre, full of joy, heart, sorrow and uncomfortable reality".

[...] Suskin singled out [...] "Days and Days" [...] for especial praise, calling it [...] "a staggering piece of musical theatre writing". He also lauded the performances of Judy Kuhn ("stunning"), Michael Cerveris ("one of his finest performances ever") and the three Alisons, Beth Malone, Alexandra Socha and Sydney Lucas (calling the last [...] "one of the most assured child actors we've seen"). Suskin called Fun Home [...] "the best musical on the New York stage of 2013 — far outclassing the competition — and ... thus far the best musical of the 2013-14 season." ...|$|E

500|$|Songs like [...] "Good Morning, Starshine" [...] and [...] "Aquarius" [...] {{reflect the}} 1960s {{cultural}} interest in astrological and cosmic concepts. [...] "Aquarius" [...] {{was the result}} of Rado's research into his own astrological sign. [...] The company's astrologer, Maria Crummere, was consulted about casting: Sheila was usually played by a Libra or Capricorn and Berger by a Leo, although Ragni, the original Berger, was a Virgo. [...] Crummere was also consulted when deciding when the show would open on Broadway and in other cities. [...] The 1971 Broadway <b>Playbill</b> reported that she chose April 29, 1968 for the Broadway premiere. [...] "The 29th was auspicious ... because the moon was high, indicating that people would attend in masses. [...] The position of the 'history makers' (Pluto, Uranus, Jupiter) in the 10th house made the show unique, powerful and a money-maker.

500|$|Wilde's two final comedies, An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest, {{were still}} on stage in London {{at the time of}} his prosecution, and they were soon closed as the details of his case became public. After two years in prison with hard labour, Wilde went into exile in Paris, sick and depressed, his {{reputation}} destroyed in England. In 1898, when no-one else would, Leonard Smithers agreed with Wilde to publish the two final plays. Wilde proved to be a diligent reviser, sending detailed instructions on stage directions, character listings and the presentation of the book, and insisting that a <b>playbill</b> from the first performance be reproduced inside. Ellmann argues that the proofs show a man [...] "very much in command of himself and of the play". Wilde's name did not appear on the cover, it was [...] "By the Author of Lady Windermere's Fan". His return to work was brief though, as he refused to write anything else, [...] "I can write, but have lost the joy of writing".|$|E

She co-starred in her own television series, All's Fair, with Richard Crenna in 1976–77. [...] She played a young, liberal photographer, who becomes romantically involved with an older, conservative columnist. [...] Although Peters was praised for her charismatic performance, the show ran for only one season. [...] Peters was nominated for a Golden Globe award as Best TV Actress– Musical/Comedy. [...] In March 2005, she made a pilot for an ABC situation comedy series titled Adopted, co-starring with Christine Baranski, but it was not picked up. Peters appeared in the Lifetime television movie Living Proof, which was first broadcast on October 18, 2008. She played the role of Barbara, an art teacher with breast cancer, who is initially reluctant {{to participate in the study}} for the cancer drug Herceptin. Andrew Gans of <b>Playbill</b> wrote, [...] "Peters is able to choose from an expansive emotional palette to color the character, and her performance... is moving, humorous and ultimately spirit-raising".|$|E
