5|$|Preventing Aβ {{aggregation}} is {{a promising}} method to developing therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer's disease, according to Drs. Naeem and Fazili in a literature review article. In 2008, Folding@home simulated {{the dynamics of}} Aβ aggregation in atomic detail over timescales {{of the order of}} tens of seconds. <b>Prior</b> <b>studies</b> were only able to simulate about 10 microseconds. Folding@home was able to simulate Aβ folding for six orders of magnitude longer than formerly possible. Researchers used {{the results of this study}} to identify a beta hairpin that was a major source of molecular interactions within the structure. The study helped prepare the Pande lab for future aggregation studies and for further research to find a small peptide which may stabilize the aggregation process.|$|E

40|$|The counter {{model for}} perceptual {{identification}} (Ratcliff & McKoon, 1997) differs from alternative views of word recognition in two important ways. First, {{it assumes that}} <b>prior</b> <b>study</b> of a word does not result in increased sensitivity but, rather, in bias. Second, the effects of word frequency and <b>prior</b> <b>study</b> are explained by different mechanisms. In the present experiment, study status and word frequency of target and foil were varied independently. Using a forced-choice task, we replicated the bias effect. However, we also found several interactions between frequency and <b>prior</b> <b>study</b> that are in direct conflict with the counter model. Most important, <b>prior</b> <b>study</b> of both alternatives resulted in an attenuation of the frequency effect {{and an increase in}} performance for low- frequency targets, but not for high-frequency targets. These findings suggest that the effects of frequency and <b>prior</b> <b>study</b> are not mediated by completely independent mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Retrieving {{effectively}} {{from memory}} (REM; R. M. Shiffrin & M.

McKoon (1997 :), In those studies, {{the influence of}} <b>prior</b> <b>study</b> was greatest when words were presented most briefly and when forced-choice targets and foils were most similar. R. Ratcliff and G. McKoon use these data to argue against models in which <b>prior</b> <b>study</b> changes a word's representation. A model in which <b>prior</b> <b>study</b> changes a word's representation by adding context information is fit to their data; at test, the model uses a Bayesian decision process to compare the perceptual and context features associated with the test flash to stored traces. The effects of <b>prior</b> <b>study</b> are due to matching extra context information and are larger when alternatives share many features. thereby reducing noise that attenuates these effects...|$|R

Dallam, however, addressed the topic of several <b>prior</b> <b>studies</b> having found statistically significant relations between CSA and maladjustment even after controlling for family environment.|$|E

40|$|SummaryWe {{tested the}} {{involvement}} of cognition in adult experience-dependent neuroplasticity using primate cortical implants. In a <b>prior</b> <b>study,</b> learning an operant sensory discrimination increased cortical excitability and target selectivity. Here, the prior task was separated into three behavioral phases. First, naive animals were exposed to stimulus-reward pairings from the <b>prior</b> <b>study.</b> These yoked animals {{did not have to}} discriminate to be rewarded and did not learn the discrimination. The plasticity observed in the <b>prior</b> <b>study</b> did not occur. Second, the animals were classically conditioned to discriminate the same stimuli in a simplified format. Learning was accompanied by increased sensory response strength and an increased range of sensory inputs eliciting responses. The third study recreated the original operant discrimination, and selectivity for task targets increased. These studies demonstrate that cognitive association between sensory stimuli and reinforcers accompanies adult experience-dependent cortical plasticity and suggest that selectivity in representation and action are linked...|$|R
30|$|Our study {{demonstrates}} that midazolam increases preload dependency in an endotoxic shock rabbit model. This result {{is inconsistent with}} a <b>prior</b> clinical observational <b>study</b> also conducted by our work team in which midazolam use did not increase the preload dependency in septic shock patients [20]. The following reasons may explain this inconsistency. First, the midazolam dose regimen in the <b>prior</b> <b>study</b> was a bolus dose of 2.5  mg and continuous infusion of 1.5  mg h, which {{is equivalent to the}} dose in the MID 1 group in our study, and the effects on vascular tone were not obvious. Second, the sedation was titrated to Ramsay 3 – 4 points in the <b>prior</b> <b>study,</b> and the rabbits were anaesthetized using ketamine with midazolam. These sedatives are likely not comparable.|$|R

2500|$|A major {{achievement}} of UCERF3 is {{use of a}} new methodology that can model multifault ruptures such as have been observed in recent earthquakes.

2500|$|Expert advice {{published}} in the 2010 document Planning Guidance for Response to a Nuclear Detonation is to shelter in place, in an area away from building fires, for at least 1 to 2 hours following a nuclear detonation and fallout arriving, [...] with the greatest benefit, assuming personnel are in a building with a high protection factor, is sheltering for no less than 12 to 24 hours before evacuation. Therefore, sheltering {{for the first few}} hours can save lives. Indeed, death and injury from local fallout is regarded by experts as the most preventable of all the effects of a nuclear detonation, being simply dependent on if personnel know how to identify an adequate shelter when they see one and enter one quickly, with the number of potential people saved being cited as in the hundreds of thousands. Or even higher if the remaining occupants of the city are made aware of the contaminated areas, by emergency systems, within hours of the events aftermath. In 2009-2013 a further iteration on sheltering-in-place was made to determine the optimal improvised fallout-shelter-residence-times following a nuclear detonation, with computer analysis, and including a summary of <b>prior</b> <b>studies</b> and guidance, it was found that individuals should quickly get into the best intact building at least under 5 minutes distant in travel time following the detonation and they should stay there for at least 30 minutes before venturing out to find a shelter with a higher protection factor but that is a greater travel time away +10 minutes. However, although this would be effective in cases were the initial building protection factor is less than about 10, it requires a high degree of individual situational awareness that may be optimistic to assume following the shock of a nuclear detonation, if a building with a PF of 20 or more is nearby, such as the fallout shelters depicted in the film, {{in the vast majority of}} fallout circumstances, it would not be advisable to leave it until 3+ hours have elapsed following the initial arrival of the local fallout.|$|E

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Context: Defect {{reporting}} {{is an important}} part of software development in-vivo, but previous work from open source context suggests that defect reports often have insufficient information for defect fixing. Objective: Our goal was to reproduce and partially replicate one of those open source studies in industrial context to see how well the results could be generalized. Method: We surveyed developers from six industrial software development organizations about the defect report information, from three viewpoints: concerning quality, usefulness and automation possibilities of the information. Seventy-four developers out of 142 completed our survey. Results: Our reproduction confirms the results of the <b>prior</b> <b>study</b> in that "steps to reproduce" and "observed behaviour" are highly important defect information. Our results extend the results of the <b>prior</b> <b>study</b> as we found that "part of the application", "configuration of the application", and "operating data" are also highly important, but they were not surveyed in the <b>prior</b> <b>study.</b> Finally, we classified defect information as "critical problems", "solutions", "boosters", and "essentials" based on the survey answers. Conclusion: The quality of defect reports is a problem in the software industry as well as in the open source community. Thus, we suggest that a part of the defect reporting should be automated since many of the defect reporters lack technical knowledge or interest to produce high-quality defect reports...|$|R
