50|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>deposition</b> uses mechanical, {{electromechanical}} or thermodynamic {{means to}} produce a thin film of solid. An everyday example is the formation of frost. Since most engineering materials are held together by relatively high energies, and chemical reactions {{are not used to}} store these energies, commercial <b>physical</b> <b>deposition</b> systems tend to require a low-pressure vapor environment to function properly; most can be classified as physical vapor deposition (PVD).|$|E
50|$|Examples of <b>physical</b> <b>deposition</b> include:A thermal {{evaporator}} {{that uses}} an electric resistance heater to melt {{the material and}} raise its vapor pressure to a useful range. This is done in a high vacuum, both to allow the vapor to reach the substrate without reacting with or scattering against other gas-phase atoms in the chamber, and reduce the incorporation of impurities from the residual gas in the vacuum chamber. Obviously, only materials with a much higher vapor pressure than the heating element can be deposited without contamination of the film. Molecular beam epitaxy is a particularly sophisticated form of thermal evaporation.|$|E
5000|$|Metalorganic {{vapour phase}} epitaxy (MOVPE), {{also known as}} {{organometallic}} vapour phase epitaxy (OMVPE) or metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD), is a chemical vapour deposition method used to produce single or polycrystalline thin films. It is a highly complex process for growing crystalline layers to create complex semiconductor multilayer structures. [...] In contrast to molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) the growth of crystals is by chemical reaction and not <b>physical</b> <b>deposition.</b> This takes place not in a vacuum, but from the gas phase at moderate pressures (10 to 760 Torr). As such, this technique is preferred {{for the formation of}} devices incorporating thermodynamically metastable alloys , and it has become a major process in the manufacture of optoelectronics.|$|E

30|$|ZnO-nanostructured {{films are}} one of the {{promising}} wide-band-gap (3.37 eV) semiconducting materials {{with a wide range of}} potential applications, including UV lasers, light emitting diodes, nanogenerators, transistors, sensors, catalysts, electron emitters, and solar cells [1, 2]. The efficiency and performance of any optical and electrical nanodevices are directly determined by the properties of underlying nanostructures, which are in turn greatly dependent on the crystallographic orientation, size, shape, and morphology. The deposition techniques and their corresponding deposition parameters play an important role in controlling the morphology and physical properties of the nanostructures. Both <b>physical</b> <b>deposition,</b> including thermal evaporation, metalorganic chemical vapor deposition, pulsed laser deposition [3 – 5], and chemical synthetic routes, including hydrothermal, solvothermal, sol–gel, electrochemical, chemical bath deposition [6 – 15], have been successfully employed to prepare a wide variety of ZnO nanostructures. The <b>physical</b> <b>deposition</b> routes have the advantages of producing high-quality materials, but also the disadvantage of the need for high temperature and catalysts such as Sn [16], Au [17, 18], Co [19], and NiO [20]. Although catalyst-free, single-step [21, 22], and multi-step [23 – 26] <b>physical</b> <b>deposition</b> methods have been achieved recently to synthesize ZnO nanostructures, the required high growth temperature necessitates the use of expensive substrates such as sapphire and silicon. Unlike the <b>physical</b> <b>deposition</b> routes, wet-chemistry or solution-based approach has attracted renewed attention due to their low temperature, catalyst-free growth processes, which lead to the successful deposition of ZnO on inexpensive substrates, including glass [13, 27 – 29] and plastics [30 – 33]. In addition, the wet-chemistry approach has strong potential in mass-scale production and deposition on large-area substrates. In the wet-chemistry approach, the concentrations and the components of the solutions play a major role in controlling the shape and size of ZnO nanostructures [34, 35].|$|E

40|$|Two-dimensional transition-metal-dichalcogenide {{semiconductors}} {{have emerged}} as promising candidates for optoelectronic devices with unprecedented properties and ultra-compact performances. However atomically thin materials are highly sensitive to surrounding dielectric media, which imposes severe limitations to their practical applicability. Hence for their suitable integration into devices, the development of reliable encapsulation procedures that preserve their physical properties are required. Here, the excitonic photoluminescence of WSe 2 monolayer flakes is assessed, at room temperature and 10 K, on mechanically exfoliated flakes encapsulated with SiOx and AlxOy layers employing chemical and <b>physical</b> <b>deposition</b> techniques. Conformal flakes coating on untreated - non-functionalized - flakes is successfully demonstrated by all the techniques except for atomic layer deposition, where a cluster-like oxide coating is observed. No significant compositional or strain state changes in the flakes are detected upon encapsulation {{by any of the}} techniques. Remarkably, our results evidence that the flakes' optical emission is strongly influenced by the quality of the encapsulating oxide - stoichiometry -. When the encapsulation is carried out with slightly sub-stoichiometric oxides two remarkable phenomena are observed. First, there is a clear electrical doping of the monolayers that is revealed through a dominant trion - charged exciton - room-temperature photoluminescence. Second, a strong decrease of the monolayers optical emission is measured attributed to non-radiative recombination processes and/or carriers transfer from the flake to the oxide. Power- and temperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements further confirm that stoichiometric oxides obtained by <b>physical</b> <b>deposition</b> lead to a successful encapsulation.

40|$|Molding of nano {{structures}} by {{injection molding}} leads to special {{requirements for the}} tools e. g., wear resistance and {{as low as possible}} release forces of the molded components. On the other hand it is not allowed to affect the replication precision. <b>Physical</b> vapor <b>deposition</b> is one of the promising technologies for applying coatings with adapted properties like high hardness, low roughness, low Young's modulus and less adhesion to the plastics melt. Although <b>physical</b> vapor <b>deposition</b> technology allows the deposition of films on micro structures without changing the structure significantly, film deposition on nano structures and small micro structures leads to a relevant change in surface topography. For this reason direct structuring of <b>physical</b> vapor <b>deposition</b> coatings might be beneficial. In this paper structuring was done using a picoseconds ultraviolet laser, Lumera Laser "Rapid," with a master oscillator power amplifier system at 355 nm. Two different coatings were deposited by magnetron sputter ion plating <b>physical</b> vapor <b>deposition</b> technology for laser structuring tests ((Cr,Al) N, (Cr,Al,SON).

40|$|The role of defects on a {{substrate}} surface {{during the}} initial stages of nucleation and growth of Ag deposited electrochemically and physically on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) has been observed ex situ by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The silver was electrodeposited under current controlled electrochemical conditions at 26 µA/cm 2, which corresponded to a deposition rate of 0. 1 monolayers (ML) per second. For comparison, <b>physical</b> <b>deposition</b> of Ag on HOPG was performed by DC Ar+ ion sputtering, at the same deposition rate and for the same deposition times. In both cases, Ag grows in an island growth mode, but the distribution of the islands appears to be quite different. In <b>physical</b> <b>deposition,</b> the Ag islands are almost homogeneously distributed over the substrate surface and a slight accumulation of islands on steps does not contribute significantly to the overall morphology. This indicates the crucial role of point defects on the substrate in {{the initial stages of}} nucleation. In electrochemical deposition, more lined defects are observed after a flow of current, and their role {{in the beginning of the}} nucleation is more pronounced. Lined defects are responsible for the string-like shaped domains of deposited atoms. Also, the existence of string-like shaped nucleation exclusion zones is indicated. The problem of the formation of nucleation exclusion zones, which appear only in electrochemical deposition, has been reconsidered and a new explanaton of their formation is given. A mathematical model for the calculation of the radius of the nucleation exclusion zone has been developed...|$|E

Because the chemical transformation and <b>physical</b> <b>deposition</b> processes are assumed to be linear in the concentrations, the contributions of many sources may be determined by superposition.
