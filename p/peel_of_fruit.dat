40|$|The {{biochemical}} {{and molecular}} basis of chlorophyll (Chl) catabolism in bananas was investigated during ripening at 20 °C and at an elevated temperature (35 °C) where degreening is inhibited. Biochemical {{analysis showed that}} Chl breakdown products could be isolated from fruit ripened at both temperatures. The coloured breakdown products, chlorophyllide and pheophorbide, were not detected at any stage of ripening in the two treatments; however, a non-fluorescent Chl catabolite accumulated to a higher concentration at 20 than at 35 °C. To investigate the ripening-related gene expression associated with these changes, a cDNA library was generated from the <b>peel</b> <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> ripened at 20 °C. Differential screening of this library produced 20 non-redundant families of clones including those encoding enzymes involved in ethylene biosynthesis, respiration, starch metabolism, cell wall degradation and other metabolic events. The expression of these genes was followed by northern analysis in fruit ripened at 20 and 35 °C...|$|E
40|$|Background: ‘Honeycrisp’ is {{an apple}} {{cultivar}} that {{is susceptible to}} soft scald, a chilling injury expressed as necrotic patches on the peel. Improved understanding of metabolism associated with the disorder would improve our understanding of soft scald and contribute to developing more effective management strategies for apple storage. It was expected that specific gene expression and specific metabolite levels in the peel would be linked with soft scald risk at harvest and/or specific time points during cold storage. Results: Fruit from nine ‘Honeycrisp’ apple orchards that would eventually develop different incidences of soft scald between 4 and 8 weeks of cold air storage were used to contrast and determine differential transcriptomic and metabolomic changes during storage. Untargeted metabolic profiling revealed changes {{in a number of}} distinct pathways preceding and concurrent with soft scald symptom development, including elevated γ-aminobutryic acid (GABA), 1 -hexanol, acylated steryl glycosides, and free p-coumaryl acyl esters. At harvest, levels of sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid acyl esters were relatively higher in <b>peel</b> <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> that did not later develop the disorder. RNA-seq driven gene expression profiling highlighted possible involvement of genes and associated metabolic processes with soft scald development. These included elevated expression of genes involved in lipid peroxidation and phenolic metabolism in fruit with soft scald, and isoprenoid/brassinosteroid metabolism in fruit that did not develop soft scald. Expression of other stress-related genes in fruit that developed soft scald included chlorophyll catabolism, cell wall loosening, and lipid transport while superoxide dismutases were up-regulated in fruit that did not develop the disorder. Conclusions: This study delineates the sequential transcriptomic and metabolomic changes preceding soft scald symptom development. Changes were differential depending on susceptibility of fruit to the disorder and could be attributed to key stress related and mediating pathways. Keywords:status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Although, the {{ripening}} <b>of</b> climacteric <b>fruits</b> such as bananas {{is known}} to be mainly triggered by ethylene, cytokinins may also intervene in the control and regulation of this process. Bananas were treated by dipping for 24 h in solutions of cytokinins at concentrations ranging from 10 - 6 to 10 - 3 M to determine effects of these phytohormones on some parameters during the fruit ripening. At all concentrations used, benzylaminopurine induced significant retentions of water in the <b>peel</b> <b>of</b> banana <b>fruits.</b> Only 10 - 3 M kinetin solution was significantly effective in inhibiting the decrease of water content in the peel. There was an inhibition of the accumulation of water in the pulp of bananas after treatments with kinetin or benzylaminopurine. Qualitative analysis <b>of</b> pigments in <b>peel</b> extracts revealed an inhibition of chlorophyll degradation after application of cytokinins. Thus, banana fruits treated with 10 - 3 M kinetin still contained only chlorophyll a whereas, fruits treated with 10 - 3 M benzylaminopurine contained both chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b at ripening stage 7. At this ripening stage, no chlorophyll could be detected in extracts from the <b>peel</b> <b>of</b> control <b>fruits.</b> There were increased accumulations of monoacylglycerol, triacylglycerol and free fatty acids in the <b>peel</b> <b>of</b> banana <b>fruits</b> treated with 10 - 3 M benzylaminopurine.

Grapefruit, pomelo, citron, and orange from various markets in Saudi Arabia were collected and subjected to QuEChERS/DPX extraction. As identification techniques, GC-MS (full scan and SIM) and high resolution LC-QToF-MS (MS e mode with three transitions) were applied. Osthole was identified in grapefruit, pomelo, and citron. Orange was practically free of osthole. The highest concentrations of osthole were found in the <b>peel</b> <b>of</b> all <b>fruits,</b> in the range of 7. 0 - 78. 5 mg/kg.
