Since most leasehold developments are undertaken by commercial entities, commonholds did not become widespread. There are, however, other statutes in place that give some degree <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> for <b>leaseholders.</b> It is, nevertheless, essential to consider proper legal advice whenever engaged in the purchase of a flat, for the requirements for a fully marketable flat remain complex.|$|R

This paper also briefly points out possible difficulties which might occur even though the legal regulation is quite detailed. The thesis is trying to mention relevant established practice of courts in connection to certain areas of this regulation. The legal institute of a lease {{of an apartment}} and house presents irreplaceable part of every legal system because of the fact why people enter into such contract.
