It was Corinthians' first title. In 2013, Atlético Mineiro needed to beat Olimpia 2–0 in the second leg to take the match to <b>penalties</b> <b>and</b> did so; Victor, the goalkeeper, performed spectacularly and helped secure the title for the club.

5|$|Another {{reason is}} the {{protection}} of star players. Fighting within the game can also {{send a message to}} players and coaches from other teams that cheap shots, dirty plays, and targeting specific players will not be tolerated and there will be consequences involved. Fighting can provide retribution for a team's player getting targeted or injured. Overall, fighting is known to be a beneficial policing that the game needs to keep players in line. Over the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Gretzky, who was protected by Dave Semenko, Marty McSorley, and others, and Brett Hull, who was protected by Kelly Chase and others. Many believe that without players protecting each other, referees would affect the game play by having to call more <b>penalties,</b> <b>and</b> the league would have to suspend players for longer periods.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, the IRS seized most of Nelson's assets, {{claiming}} that he owed US$32,000,000. In addition to the unpaid taxes, Nelson's situation was worsened by the weak investments he had made during the early 1980s. In 1978, after he fired Reshen, Nelson was introduced by Dallas lawyer Terry Bray to the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. To repay the debt Reshen had created with the IRS, Nelson was recommended to invest in tax shelters that ultimately flopped. While the IRS disallowed his deductions for 1980, 1981 and 1982 (at a time that Nelson's income multiplied), due to <b>penalties</b> <b>and</b> interests, the debt increased {{by the end of}} the decade.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, UBS {{agreed to}} pay US$160 million in restitution, <b>penalties</b> <b>and</b> disgorgement of profits for rigging bids in the U.S. {{municipal}} bond market, after the bank and three of its employees were charged by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2010. In July 2013, the three employees were convicted of conspiracy in the muni market fraud: former UBS Vice President Gary Heinz was sentenced to 27 months in prison and fined US$400,000; former UBS global commodities chief Peter Ghavami was sentenced to 18 months and fined US $1 million; and former UBS VP Michael Welty received a 16-month sentence and fined US$300,000. In addition to conspiracy, Ghavami and Heinz also were convicted of wire fraud. Federal prosecutors had asked for much harsher sentences, but U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood rebuffed the request. Wood said that the criminal behavior of the three was an aberration from their normal law-abiding lives.|$|E

5|$|In the 1999–2000 season, Arsenal {{participated in}} the Premier League. Despite the loss of striker Nicolas Anelka to Real Madrid, the club {{significantly}} strengthened in the summer, signing defenders Oleg Luzhny and Sylvinho as well as forwards Davor Šuker and Thierry Henry. Inconsistent performances in the league against lowly opposition meant Arsenal never posed a serious title challenge, ending the campaign as runners-up, 18 points behind Manchester United. The club had another poor season in the Champions League, finishing third in their group; this won them a consolation place in the UEFA Cup and Arsenal managed {{to go all the}} way to the final, where they faced Galatasaray in Copenhagen.
