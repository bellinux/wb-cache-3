Examines the definition of "refugee" {{set out in the}} Convention relating to the Status of Refugees 1951 and Directive 2004 / 83, the principle of non-refoulement, the status of asylum seekers, European migration policy and access to asylum procedures. Looks at the Commission Green Paper on the future Common European Asylum System, regional protection programmes, the possibility of an EU-wide resettlement scheme, and <b>protected</b> <b>entry</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} the strategic development of the external dimension of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS), a system which forms {{an integral part of}} the space of freedom and security. Seeking to assess the level of realisation of the EU’s ambition to become an important actor in international refugee protection and to establish a genuinely coherent asylum policy, the paper evaluates the state of development of the external dimension of the CEAS. Regional Protection Programmes, which seek to enhance protection capacity in third countries, as well as the efforts to establish a voluntary Joint European Resettlement Programme in solidarity towards third states, are analysed. The debate relating to <b>protected</b> <b>entry</b> <b>procedures</b> is also considered, albeit more briefly as there have not yet been any concrete proposals or common actions at the EU level in this respect. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the unforeseen or unintended {{effects of the}} European Union’s refugee law on the world’s most vulnerable refugees, those forgotten by the law. The paper focuses on those refugees automatically denied protection in Europe by being impliedly defined out of the EU’s refugee definition. Not only must refugees seeking protection in Europe meet the legal definition, {{but they are also}} assumed to have the means to reach Europe. Due to the limitations on legal access routes, often only those who can afford to pay a smuggler have the chance to reach Europe. The great majority of the world’s refugees remain outside Europe. Therefore, an exploration of the external policies of the EU institutions which are designed to counter the limiting affects of its restrictive migration policy is required. The paper examines the move towards the establishment of Regional Protection Programmes, <b>Protected</b> <b>Entry</b> <b>Procedures</b> and Resettlement Schemes as providing possible hope for enduring protection for those refugees trapped outside Europe...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic stripe {{cards are}} in common use for {{electronic}} payments and cash withdrawal. Reported incidents document that criminals easily pickpocket cards or skim them by swiping them through additional card readers. Personal identi. cation numbers (PINs) are obtained by shoulder surfing, {{through the use}} of mirrors or concealed miniature cameras. Both elements, the PIN and the card, are generally sufficient to give the criminal full access to the victim's account. In this paper, we present alternative PIN entry methods to which we refer as cognitive trapdoor games. These methods make it significantly harder for a criminal to obtain PINs even if he fully observes the entire input and output of a PIN <b>entry</b> <b>procedure.</b> We also introduce the idea of probabilistic cognitive trapdoor games, which offer resilience to shoulder surfing even if the criminal records a PIN <b>entry</b> <b>procedure</b> with a camera. We studied the security as well as the usability of our methods. The result support the hypothesis that our primary mechanism strikes a balance between security and usability that is of practical value. In this article, we give a detailed account of our mechanisms and their evaluation...|$|R
40|$|In 2007 the Commission {{proposed}} a Directive aimed exclusively at third-country nationals moving to Europe {{for the purpose}} of highly qualified employment that would set up a harmonized <b>entry</b> <b>procedure,</b> lay down common residence conditions and facilitate mobility through Europe. The Directive, named Blue Card, was meant to make Europe more attractive for highly qualified migrants by offering a fast-track <b>entry</b> <b>procedure</b> and social benefits in the EU. The Commission, despite the reluctance of Member States, managed to push through the Directive, which was finally approved in 2009. In the first three years since the Blue Card first entered into force in the majority of Member States in 2012, no more than 30, 352 cards have been issued, of which about 26, 200 by a single Member State. Why? Through a detailed analysis of the conditions set by the Directive and their comparison with the ones posed by the national labour migration schemes - in particular in Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands -, this paper aims to demonstrate that the causes of failure are not to search in the Blue Card instrument per se, but rather in the ways this has been implemented in the single Member States...|$|R
