5|$|A two-minute minor <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> {{often called}} for lesser infractions such as slashing, tripping, elbowing, roughing, too many players, illegal equipment, holding, or interference. Five-minute major {{penalties}} are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions {{that result in}} intentional injury to an opponent, {{as well as for}} fighting. Players are released from the penalty box when either the penalty time expires, or the opposition scores a goal (or three goals for the instance of a major penalty).|$|E
5|$|For most penalties, the {{offending}} player {{is sent to}} the penalty box and his team has to play without him and with one less player for a short amount of time. Most penalties last for two minutes unless a major penalty has been assessed. The team that has taken the <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> said to be playing shorthanded while the other team is on the power play.|$|E

50|$|Due to FIA {{rules about}} {{the order in}} which <b>penalties</b> <b>are</b> applied, Kubica's <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> applied first. This left him 15th and behind Fisichella. Then the Italian's <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> applied, so Kubica ended up 14th. This meant Coulthard, Button and Liuzzi all gained two places as both drivers had been ahead of them.|$|R

5|$|A {{direct method}} for {{producing}} an MSA uses the dynamic programming technique {{to identify the}} globally optimal alignment solution. For proteins, this method usually involves two sets of parameters: a gap penalty and a substitution matrix assigning scores or probabilities to the alignment of each possible pair of amino acids based on the similarity of the amino acids' chemical properties and the evolutionary probability of the mutation. For nucleotide sequences a similar gap <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> used, but a much simpler substitution matrix, wherein only identical matches and mismatches are considered, is typical. The scores in the substitution matrix may be either all positive or a mix {{of positive and negative}} {{in the case of a}} global alignment, but must be both positive and negative, in the case of a local alignment.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's {{legal system}} {{is based on}} English Common Law. Although the {{judiciary}} is theoretically independent, its independence has been called into question and the appointment of judges lacks accountability and transparency. The highest court in the judicial system is the Federal Court, followed by the Court of Appeal and two high courts, one for Peninsular Malaysia and one for East Malaysia. Malaysia also has a special court to hear cases brought by or against royalty. The death <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> in use for serious crimes such as murder, terrorism, drug trafficking, and kidnapping. Separate from and running parallel to the civil courts are the Syariah Courts, which apply Shariah law to Muslims {{in the areas of}} family law and religious observances. Homosexuality is illegal in Malaysia.|$|E
2500|$|Hamilton and Rosberg {{were both}} given ten place grid {{penalties}} for the French Grand Prix, meaning that whatever their qualifying position, they could start {{no better than}} 11th.

50|$|<b>Penalties</b> may <b>be</b> {{monetary}} or {{may involve}} forfeiture of property. Criminal penalties may include jail time, but are imposed {{only by a}} federal judge after a defendant is convicted. Most monetary <b>penalties</b> <b>are</b> based on the amount of tax not properly paid. Penalties may increase with the period of nonpayment. Some <b>penalties</b> <b>are</b> fixed dollar amounts or fixed percentages of some measure required to be reported. Excise taxes used as <b>penalties</b> <b>are</b> imposed in the Code sections relating to particular kinds of transactions. Some <b>penalties</b> may <b>be</b> waived or abated where the taxpayer shows reasonable cause for the failure.|$|R

The boys, both 17 years old, received probation and were fined £170, but later appealed the sentence. Curators said that similar incidents happen {{once or twice a}} year.|$|E

25|$|Beginning {{in about}} the 4th century, Japan became {{increasingly}} influenced by the Chinese judicial system, and gradually adopted a system of different punishments for different crimes, including the death penalty. However, beginning in the Nara period, cruel punishments and the death <b>penalty</b> <b>were</b> used less and less, probably {{as a result of}} the influence of Buddhist teachings, and the death <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> abolished completely in the Heian period.

However, in view of Witherspoon, the court found that the defendants death sentence was unconstitutionally decided. In this third hearing, the court changed its mind and decided the death <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> cruel or unusual.|$|R

5|$|After {{an armored}} car leaves a bank with ten million dollars, it is {{attacked}} en route by Diabolik who manages {{to steal the}} money and escape with his partner Eva Kant. Leaving the money in their underground hideout, Diabolik and Eva attend a press conference held by the Minister of the Interior which they disrupt by releasing laughing gas. Due to {{the high level of}} crime, the death <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> brought back. The police cannot find Diabolik, and gang leader Valmont suffers at their hands from a clampdown because of his actions. Realising things can only get worse because of Diabolik's crime spree, Valmont contacts Inspector Ginko and makes a deal to catch him for the police. At his hideout, Diabolik decides to steal the famous Aksand emerald necklace from the Saint Just Castle for Eva's birthday. Valmont builds up an identikit picture of Eva and circulates it as a means of capturing Diabolik. Diabolik scales the walls of Saint Just Castle where he finds the police lying in wait. He manages to steal the necklace by fooling the police officers with mirrors on the road and dummy decoys of himself.|$|E

The <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> either death or life imprisonment. It is a slightly less serious offence to be in a security area and consort with or be in the company of another person if it is reasonable for the person consorting to know that the other person had one of the above items.

5|$|There {{were now}} four {{possible}} actions for theft, by the victim: the action furti itself and three complementary actions. The actio furti concepti was available against the occupier {{of the building}} in which the stolen goods were found, regardless of his knowledge of them and brought three-times damages. The actio furti prohibiti could be pursued against anyone who declined a search with witnesses, with four-times damages. The actio furti non exhibiti could be brought if the respondent did not bring the thing to court, although its <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> unclear. There was a further action available to the respondent of an actio furti concepti who had been found liable: he could sue the person who gave it to him, for {{the extent of his}} own liability. That the victim could sue both the thief and handler, if he could show who the thief was, which would have difficult without the presence of the thing. This was both penal, and an attempt to give the plaintiff enough actions to compensate him, because the thief, at least was not usually solvent.|$|E
