5000|$|Transferred arc process: The arc {{is formed}} between the electrode(-) {{and the work}} piece(+). In other words, arc is {{transferred}} from the electrode to the work piece. A transferred arc possesses high energy density and plasma jet velocity. For this reason it is employed to cut and melt metals. Besides carbon steels this process can cut stainless steel and nonferrous metals where an oxyacetylene torch does not succeed. Transferred arc {{can also be used}} for welding at high arc travel speeds. For initiating a transferred arc, a current limiting resistor is put in the circuit, which permits a flow of about 50 amps, between the nozzle and electrode and a <b>pilot</b> <b>arc</b> is established between the electrode and the nozzle. As the <b>pilot</b> <b>arc</b> touches the job main current starts flowing between electrode and job, thus igniting the transferred arc. The <b>pilot</b> <b>arc</b> initiating unit gets disconnected and <b>pilot</b> <b>arc</b> extinguishes as soon as the arc between the electrode and the job is started. The temperature of a constricted plasma arc may be of the order of 8000 - 25000°C.|$|E
50|$|Plasma cutters use {{a number}} of methods to start the arc. In some units, the arc is created by putting the torch {{in contact with the}} work piece. Some cutters use a high voltage, high {{frequency}} circuit to start the arc. This method has {{a number of}} disadvantages, including risk of electrocution, difficulty of repair, spark gap maintenance, and the large amount of radio frequency emissions. Plasma cutters working near sensitive electronics, such as CNC hardware or computers, start the <b>pilot</b> <b>arc</b> by other means. The nozzle and electrode are in contact. The nozzle is the cathode, and the electrode is the anode. When the plasma gas begins to flow, the nozzle is blown forward. A third, less common method is capacitive discharge into the primary circuit via a silicon controlled rectifier.|$|E
40|$|A {{space shuttle}} high {{temperature}} reusable surface insulation (HRSI) tile array {{with a single}} missing or lost tile was exposed to a hot gas simulated reentry environment to investigate the heating conditions {{in and around the}} vicinity of the missing HRSI tile. Heat flux and pressure data for the lost tile condition were obtained by the use of a water cooled lost tile calibration model. The maximum aluminum substrate temperature obtained during the simulated reentry was 128 C (263 F). The lost tile calibration data indicated a maximum heat flux in the lost tile cavity region of 63 percent of the upstream reference value. This test was conducted at the Ames Research Center in the 20 MW semielliptical thermal protection system (TPS) <b>pilot</b> plasma <b>arc</b> test facility...|$|R
500|$|Mercy Point also {{garnered}} {{negative reactions}} from television critics, with GamesRadar's Dave Golder including {{it on his}} list of the worst science fiction and fantasy television shows of all time for its [...] "rite, obvious and cheesy" [...] storylines.

Even though Rosenberg felt the show's concept had potential and found Batung to an intriguing character, he advised the audience to [...] "change this bedpan fast". Lee Sandlin of The Chicago Reader included Mercy Point in his assessment of the worst television shows in the 1998–1999 season, criticizing its lack of originality and poor writing. The series was heavily panned by Kevin Wagner of the science-fiction online magazine The Sci-Fi Guys, who found the <b>pilot's</b> story <b>arc</b> to be uninteresting {{and the use of}} rubber gloves as a way for advanced containment to be unrealistic.The Sun-Sentinels Hal Boedeker cited Mercy Point and The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer as [...] "misbegotten fare" [...] that alienated its audience and lowered viewership by forty percent.|$|R

The holding pattern is a left-hand, 6-minute [...] Each pilot adjusts his holding pattern to depart marshal precisely at the assigned time. Aircraft departing marshal will normally be separated by 1 minute. Adjustments may be {{directed by the}} ship's Carrier Air Traffic Control Center (CATCC), if required, to ensure proper separation.

If the ship makes course correction-which is often done {{in order to make the}} relative wind (natural wind plus ship's movement generated wind) go directly down the angle deck, or to avoid obstacles-lineup to center line must be corrected.

40|$|PanDA, the Atlas {{management}} and distribution system for production and analysis jobs on EGEE and OSG clusters, {{is based on}} pilot jobs to increase the throughput and stability of the job execution on grid. The ARC middleware uses specific approach which tightly connects the job requirements with cluster capabilities like resource usage, software availability and caching of input files. The pilot concept renders the ARC features useless. The arcControlTower is the job submission system which merges the <b>pilot</b> benefits and <b>ARC</b> advantages. It takes the pilot payload from the panda server and submits the jobs to the Nordugrid ARC clusters as regular jobs, with all the job resources known in advance. All the pilot communication with the PanDA server {{is done by the}} arcControlTower, so it plays the role of a pilot factory and the pilot itself. There are several advantages to this approach: no grid middleware is needed on the worker nodes, the fair-share between the production and user jobs is tuned with the arcControlTower load parameters, the jobs can be controlled by ARC client tools. The system could be extended to other submission systems using central distribution...|$|R
40|$|Three long {{horizontal}} holes were drilled from a directionally drilled sur 2 {{hole at the}} Emerald Mine near Waynesburg, Pa. The {{purpose was}} to adapt the technique of directional drilling for use in draining methane from coalbeds. A 504 -m (1, 652 -ft) long, 76 -mm (3 -in) diam 2, circular <b>arc</b> <b>pilot</b> hole was drilled, using a downhole mud motor, to enter the Pittsburgh coalbed at a verti 2 depth of 305 m (1, 000 ft). The hole was reamed to 222 mm (8 - 3 / 4 in) and was cased to a measured depth of 486 m (1, 595 ft). Three 76 -mm (3 -in) diameter horizontal drainage holes were then drilled, totaling 2, 909 m (9, 544 ft) of horizontal hole. Improvements in drilling methods increased the average drilling rate from 20. 4 m (67 ft) to 64. 9 m (213 ft) per day. The cost of drilling the directional and horizontal holes (using a Government-owned drill rig) was 1, 169, 530, a figure inflated by inexperience and by delays caused by lost-circulation problems and fishing operations. An estimated total drilling cost of 960, 000 (including rental of a drill rig) for an improved system, was determined by a detailed cost analysis. Initial gas and water production from November 1979 through May 1980 was low because of caving of the horizontal holes drilled in shale {{near the bottom of}} the casing...|$|R
40|$|Pulsed quartz-jacketed {{high-pressure}} xenon lamps, {{operating in}} the periodic pulse repetition modes, despite the appearing UV radiation sources of other types, remain {{a critical component of}} the processing equipment used in photochemistry, photo-medicine, nanoelectronics, biology, etc. Their main advantages, namely high power and radiation energy are slightly devalued by a relatively low efficiency of the shortwave radiation. Available literature data concerning the influence of various factors on the energy level of short-wave radiation in xenon need to be systematised and generalised because they have been obtained under conditions of uncontrolled quartz-jacketed transmission. The transmission of quartz can degrade after a while and, in addition, undergo great changes during the pulse. Besides, as a rule, in the literature, there is no detailed description of a complete kit of experimental setting. As a result, to analyse the factors affecting the efficiency of studying in the UV range is difficult, and there arises a relevant problem to optimise this type of discharge parameters to increase the efficiency in the range of 220 - 400 nm. A mathematical model of the radiation source, realistically describing the processes in the xenon plasma and in the stabilising envelope, can be a reliable ground for such a study. The paper shows an impact of the discharge channel diameter and length, the filling pressure of xenon, the pulse duration, the parameters of discharge circuit, and the current of <b>pilot</b> <b>arc</b> on the radiation yield. Based on the simulation-found relationship of internal plasma parameters (temperature distributions, fields of particle concentration and radiation, dynamics of electrical resistance of discharge channel, and plasma emission spectra) with radiation characteristics of discharge, are determined conditions to ensure the greatest radiation yield in the UV region.  The experimental data prove the computational results. A material obtained gives practice-critical guidelines for development and correct selection of the short-wave radiation source. </p...|$|E
40|$|Endohedral fullerenes are {{remarkable}} molecules {{with unique}} electronic, magnetic, photovoltaic and quantum properties. They {{have found a}} number of applications in various fields. Among all the potential applications, one particularly interesting application is to employ them as building blocks for a quantum computer. However, the scientific and commercial exploitation of these materials is held back by their low productivity. In this project, the arc discharge synthesis of endoedral fullerenes which remains the most promising candidate for producing bulk quantities of Endohedral Metallofullerenes (EMFs) was divided into 4 steps, and in this thesis, I discuss the attempts {{that had been made}} to optimise each of them. In this project, I focus on Y@C 82, which is a spin active endohedral fullerene with attractive quantum properties. I obtained sights into the dynamics of the Soxhlet extraction of fullerenes, and developed an optimised Soxhlet scheme which is able to extract 95 % of Y@C 82 from the soot within 60 hours (Chapter 4). Further progress on the optimization of Soxhlet extraction was made when a two-stage Soxhlet extraction/purification was independently developed (chapter 9). This method employs two solvents (toluene and DMF) to extract fullerenes with different dipolar moment. It was not only able to extract fullerenes effectively from the soot, but also to purify EMFs/Trimetallic nitride template(TNT) into high purity (97 %). Efforts were made to search for the best conditions for generating Y@C 82 with a patented <b>pilot</b> <b>arc</b> discharge system. After analysing the data of the yield of fullerenes in various conditions with a " 2 2 factorial design of experiment", I believe the yields of Y@C 82 can be increased by using high He pressure (Chapter 5). The scaling up the production of EMFs was also tackled from a more fundamental and theoretical aspect. Although fullerenes have been efficiently synthesized by several methods to date, the formation mechanism of these materials remains a mystery. The study of the fullerene formation mechanism in arc discharge is particularly rare due to intrinsic technical difficulties. In chapter 6, I propose a new "bottom up" formation scenario in the arc discharge synthesis of fullerenes that adopts the so called "closed network growth". Attempts that were made to improve the efficiency and safety of the current system were introduced in Chapter 7. Concepts to develop a more efficient safe arc discharge system were suggested and discussed in the same chapter. The Lewis acid separation method was reported to be an efficient approach to remove the empty cages from the EMFs 1, however, this method is only suitable for a lab equipped with specialized facilities and cannot be characterized as generic (Chapter 8). Finally, I have applied a functionalization scheme to C 60 which may be a promising scheme to functionalize spin-active metallofullerenes to produce a two-qubit quantum information system (Chapter 10). </p...|$|E
40|$|The VPP A W {{process has}} been {{evaluated}} and optimised for the joining of high strength aluminium alloys AA- 2024 T 351, AA- 7150 W 51 and AA- 7150 T 651. The initial experimentation was performed with conventional AC-GTAW power supplies with limited results. Failure of the control logic to stabilise the welding process or arc extinction became an issue. Not until a suitable VPP AW power source became available were sound welding conditions developed. Still, a great effort was placed in optimising the process. Factors such as the welding torch, the electrode composition, the plasma nozzle geometry, the <b>pilot</b> <b>arc</b> current, the electrode positive duration and amplitude, the shielding gas quality {{and the effect of}} gas backing had to be thoroughly studied to achieve sound welding conditions. Subsequent to the optimisation process, operational envelopes were generated to determine the most favourable welding conditions. Based on those, reliable techniques were developed to produce sound welds on butt welded assemblies. Further on, a special plasma welding torch was developed to weld complex structures such as dual stringer panels. A number of these panels were manufactured and surpassed the damage tolerance requirements of Airbus. Hardness profiles indicated a dip in hardness in the far heat affected zone. Microstructural observation of this area revealed significant coarsening of the precipitates related to the relatively high heat input conditions of the VPPAW process. Studies which involved the reduction of the heat input were carried out. Variables such as the addition of filler wire, the use of helium as shielding gas, the combined effect of both, and the use of an edge preparation were assessed. Temperature measurements were performed at different positions along the HAZ in order to relate the thermal history with the microstructural degradation by means of cooling curves and TTT diagrams. Similar investigations were performed under low heat input welding conditions with DC-GT A W helium shielding. I Variable polarity plasma arc welding of high strength aluminium alloys. Tensile tests were performed on selected specimens in order to asses the effect of temper condition, post weld heat treatment and heat input. The results of which indicated that low heat input conditions improved the tensile properties of the far heat affected zone. With regards to temper condition it was observed that the W 51 temper was more advantageous. It was also noticed that VPPA welds offered similar 0. 2 % proof stress and ultimate tensile strength than that of MIG welds, together with, although still very low, improved elongation properties. This piece of research has involved the welding of high strength aluminium alloys which were considered difficult to weld or even unweldable in some cases. Prior attempts were performed with MIG welding but micro voids acting as initiation sites for cracks limited the damage tolerance of the assemblies. On the contrary VPPAW has proved its ability to produce extremely high quality welds where gas porosity or micro voids were almost inexistent...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA new 3 -D {{model has}} been {{developed}} to describe the interaction between a transferred electric arc and a liquid metal bath, and {{has been used to}} simulate a <b>pilot</b> axisymmetrical transferred <b>arc</b> furnace operating in the EDF Research and Development laboratory. This model enables calculations of the flow patterns, temperature distribution and electromagnetic fields in both the arc and the bath. The Navier-Stokes equation coupled with the electromagnetic relations are solved in each domain using a finite volume method. The source term in the radiative energy equation is modeled using the radiative transfer method in order {{to take into account the}} strong temperature variations in the electric arc. The transport and condensation of metal vapour in the arc domain are considered by solving a conservation equation for the vapour mass fraction. The arc flow calculation at the bath surface uses a one-dimensional sheath model taking account of the metal vapour, in order to ensure the coupling between the plasma and the bath by evaluating the boundary conditions at the arc/bath interface. The calculations were performed for an arc length of 0. 25 m. Realistic predictions are obtained for the electrical, dynamic and thermal behaviour of the plasma and liquid metal, and also for the arc voltage. The results indicate that the effects of the arc impact and Lorentz forces are not sufficient to induce effective mixing throughout the metal bath, leading to a marked thermal stratification in the liquid metal. In the bath, the liquid/solid interface has been determined by calculations. Keyword...|$|R
40|$|The affordable, robust, compact (ARC) reactor {{conceptual}} design study aims {{to reduce the}} size, cost, and complexity of a combined fusion nuclear science facility (FNSF) and demonstration fusion <b>Pilot</b> power plant. <b>ARC</b> is a 200 - 250 MWe tokamak reactor with a major radius of 3. 3 m, a minor radius of 1. 1 m, and an on-axis magnetic field of 9. 2 T. ARC has rare earth barium copper oxide (REBCO) superconducting toroidal field coils, which have joints to enable disassembly. This allows the vacuum vessel to be replaced quickly, mitigating first wall survivability concerns, and permits a single device to test many vacuum vessel designs and divertor materials. The design point has a plasma fusion gain of Q_p~ 13. 6, yet is fully non-inductive, with a modest bootstrap fraction of only ~ 63 %. Thus ARC offers a high power gain with relatively large external control of the current profile. This highly attractive combination is enabled by the ~ 23 T peak field on coil with newly available REBCO superconductor technology. External current drive is provided by two innovative inboard RF launchers using 25 MW of lower hybrid and 13. 6 MW of ion cyclotron fast wave power. The resulting efficient current drive provides a robust, steady state core plasma far from disruptive limits. ARC uses an all-liquid blanket, consisting of low pressure, slowly flowing fluorine lithium beryllium (FLiBe) molten salt. The liquid blanket is low-risk technology and provides effective neutron moderation and shielding, excellent heat removal, and a tritium breeding ratio >= 1. 1. The large temperature range over which FLiBe is liquid permits blanket operation at 900 K with single phase fluid cooling and a high-efficiency Brayton cycle, allowing for net electricity generation when operating <b>ARC</b> as a <b>Pilot</b> power plant.
