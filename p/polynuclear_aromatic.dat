50|$|Naturally {{occurring}} {{within the}} soil are microbial populations that utilize hydrocarbons {{as a source}} of energy and Carbon. Upwards to twenty percent of microbial soil populations have the ability to metabolize hydrocarbons. These populations can through either accelerated or natural monitored attenuation be utilized to neutralize within the soil hydrocarbon pollutants. The metabolic mode of hydrocarbon remediation is primarily aerobic. The end products of the remediation for hydrocarbons are Carbon Dioxide and water. Hydrocarbons vary in ease of degradation based on their structure. Long chain aliphatic carbons are the most effectively degraded. Short chained, branched, and quaternary aliphatic hydrocarbons are less effectively degraded. Alkene degradation is dependent on the saturation of the chain with saturated alkenes being more readily degraded. Large numbers of microbes with the ability to metabolize aromatic hydrocarbons are present within the soil. Aromatic hydrocarbons are also susceptible to being degraded through anaerobic metabolism. Hydrocarbon metabolism is an important facet of in situ bioremediation due to the severity of petroleum spills around the world. <b>Polynuclear</b> <b>aromatic</b> carbons susceptibility to degradation is related to the number of aromatic rings within the compound. Compounds with two or three rings are degraded at an effective rate, compounds possessing four or more rings can be more resilient to bioremediation efforts. Degradation of <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatic</b> carbons with less than four rings is accomplished by various aerobic microbes present in the soil. For larger compounds the only metabolic mode that has shown to be effective is cometabolism. The fungus genus Phanerochaete under anaerobic conditions has species with the ability to metabolize some <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatic</b> carbons utilizing a peroxidase enzyme.|$|E

40|$|The {{economic}} {{viability of the}} thermocatalytic upgrade of biomass-derived oxygenates is facing the challenge of low-quality products. This is because of leaching of active species, coking, and concomitant catalyst deactivation. These cumulate into the loss of catalytic activity with time on stream (TOS), which causes low degree of deoxygenation. Thus, this article reviews recent advances aimed at alleviating these setbacks to make the process viable for industrial scale-up. To {{understand the concept of}} catalyst deactivation and to offer solutions, the review scrutinized the deactivation mechanism diligently. The review also analyzes deactivation-suppression techniques such as nanocrystal zeolite cracking, hydrogen spilt-over (HSO) species, and composite catalysts (hybrid, hierarchical mesoporous zeolite, modified zeolites, and catalytic cracking deposition of silane). Interestingly, these deactivation-suppression techniques enhance catalytic properties mostly by reducing the signal strength of strong acid sites and increasing hydrothermal stability. Further, the approaches improve catalytic activity, selectivity, and TOS stability because of the lower formation of coke precursors such as <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatics.</b> However, despite these many advances, the need for further investigations to achieve excellent catalytic activity for industrial scale-up persists...|$|R

40|$|Some <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatics</b> (PNA) {{have been}} found to be potent {{carcinogens}} for all tissues and organs of experimental animals that have been exposed to them, but different dose levels are needed for these effects. They have been known for decades to cause cancer at the site of application but also at certain sites distant from the area of contact. Although some hydrocarbons are potent and complete carcinogens, the majority of related hydrocarbons was originally found to be inactive. Since they generally appear together, it was important to know more about their interaction, particularly whether they would synergize, or antagonize. The polycyclic hydrocarbons have been studied by subcutaneous injection, where they prove very potent carcinogens. They are also very active on the skin of mice where they produce cancer on prolonged application. Inhalation studies, require larger doses yielded negative results until particulate matter was introduced which facilitated the development of lung tumors. Although iron oxide dust was used initially, other dusts were also capable of enhancing the response of the tissue to benzo(a) pyrene carcinogenesis. This point is of importance, particularly since the inhalation of PNA in situations of air pollution or coal mining involves particulates, although of a different type. Soot is not a homogenous substance and several factors determine its properties. Soots will lose some of the absorbed chemicals during their residence in air, but they retain their PNAs for long periods of time when they reach the soil. The carcinogenicity of PNAs in the adsorbed state may be completely absent, depending on particle size of the soot and availability of eluting capability of the tissues or cells in contact with the soot. Whenever the carcinogenic <b>polynuclear</b> <b>aromatics</b> can be eluted they will be active in producing cancer if their residence is adequate. There seems to be no reason to assume that a large increase in coal combustion in the future will by necessity lead to greater risks of cancer to the coal miners or the general urban dweller, because activities to be started now can take into consideration the requirements necessary for control of air pollution in mines as well as in cities. If new uses of coal will be developed, it will be a completely different situation, and statements about the carcinogenic risk from coal utilization do not apply there. Although some of the same carcinogenic PNAs are involved in the health hazards from those processes, other carcinogens and also cocarcinogens will be present, and the exposed workers will not have the apparent benefits of adsorption of PNAs on soot...|$|R

The estimation of carbon balance and of soil organic matter assessed the fate of residual hydrocarbons.

Hydrocarbon accumulation did not inhibit biodegradation performance. Conversion of hydrocarbons to CO 2 predominated during active disposal; incorporation into soil organic matter predominated during the closure period. In this sludge, the predominant PNAs were degraded more completely (85 %) than total hydrocarbons. Both biodegradation and abiotic losses of three- and four-ring PNAs contributed to this result.
