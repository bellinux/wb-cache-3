Insertion of grounding capacitor connected between the ground and neutral point of star winding of a transformer {{at one end of the}} transmission line during the period of open conductor makes the net zero sequence reactance to be zero. The zero sequence network shunts the negative sequence network and the negative sequence current is reduced to a negligible value.

40|$|Abstract:- Distribution {{control systems}} are {{normally}} managed by experienced control engineers who manage the different switching operations {{in order to}} isolate one or more stations for maintenance or for repairing faults. Whenever a fault takes place, these engineers have to quickly prepare a switching plan to isolate a station or a complete circuit {{which is a very}} logically complex task due to the complexity of current and voltage flow and the challenging task of ensuring the minimum disturbance to the current supply to the customers. The distribution network is a very dynamic environment of changing circuits and flow and contains thousands of substations, switching stations, feeders, <b>poles,</b> switches, <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> and cables. Preparing a switching plan requires knowledge of the up-to-date network. The switching plan is normally prepared manually and can take from a few minutes to a few hours to complete in order to reduce risk to field workers and to minimize the supply disturbance. In this paper, we have analyzed the switching plans mechanism and developed a number of algorithms to help the control engineers prepare switching plans quickly and put them to action. Our method not only ensures that the disturbance of the supply to customers is reduced but also minimizes the risk to the filed engineers. In this paper, we show only a sample of the many automatically prepared switching plans which have been tested and proven...|$|R
