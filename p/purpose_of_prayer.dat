25|$|The act {{of prayer}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} Bahá'í laws for individual discipline and Bahá'í are enjoined to pray daily. Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith consists of two distinct types, obligatory prayer and devotional (general) prayer. The <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>prayer</b> in the Bahá'í Faith is to get closer to God and to Bahá'u'lláh and to help better one's own conduct and to request divine assistance.|$|E
25|$|Dein and Littlewood (2008) {{suggest that}} an individual’s prayer {{life can be}} viewed on a {{spectrum}} ranging from immature to mature. A progression on the scale {{is characterized by a}} change in the perspective of the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>prayer.</b> Rather than using prayer as a means of changing the reality of a situation, a more mature individual will use prayer to request assistance in coping with immutable problems and draw closer to God or others. This change in perspective {{has been shown to be}} associated with an individual’s passage through adolescence.|$|E
5000|$|A breviary {{consists}} of a number <b>of</b> <b>prayers</b> and readings in a short form, generally {{for use by the}} clergy. The book of hours is a simplified form of breviary designed for use by the laity where the prayers are intended for recital at the canonical hours of the liturgical day. Canonical hours refer to the division of day and night for the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>prayers.</b> The regular rhythm of reading led to the term [...] "book of hours".(Cazelles and Rathofer 1988) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{choice of}} venue {{depends on the}} {{intended}} participants, the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the <b>prayer</b> meeting, and the size <b>of</b> the <b>prayer</b> meeting.

2500|$|Maqam Nahwand, {{named after}} a city in Iranian Kurdistan, is applied when there is disharmony between parties and fights, in general. A related maqam is Rahawi Nawa (see below), but this has sunk in {{popularity}} and therefore most cantors almost always replace Rahawi Nawa with Maqam Nahwand, due to the surplus and variety of more Western-oriented songs in Nahwand, which closely resembles the western minor scale. Until the 20th century, this maqam was never used for the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>prayers</b> by either Jews or Muslims. (Similarly in the Middle Ages the minor or Aeolian mode, though acknowledged to exist, was never used in Gregorian chant.) ...|$|R
25|$|Synagogues are consecrated spaces {{used for}} the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>prayer,</b> Tanakh (the entire Hebrew Scriptures {{including}} Torah) reading, study and assembly; however, a synagogue is not necessary for worship. Halakha holds that communal Jewish worship {{can be carried out}} wherever ten Jews (a minyan) assemble. Worship can also be carried out alone or with fewer than ten people assembled together. However, halakha considers certain prayers as communal prayers and therefore they may be recited only by a minyan. In terms of its specific ritual and liturgical functions, the synagogue does not replace the long-since destroyed Temple in Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism) uses {{a series}} of kavanot, {{directions}} of intent, to specify the path the prayer ascends in the dialog with God, to increase its chances of being answered favorably. Kabbalists ascribe a higher meaning to the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>prayer,</b> which is no less than affecting {{the very fabric of}} reality itself, restructuring and repairing the universe in a real fashion. In this view, every word of every prayer, and indeed, even every letter of every word, has a precise meaning and a precise effect. Prayers thus literally affect the mystical forces of the universe, and repair the fabric of creation.|$|E

50|$|Vater unser im Himmelreich BWV 682 in E minor {{has long}} been {{considered}} the most complex of Bachs chorale preludes, difficult at the levels of both understanding and performance. Through a ritornello trio sonata in the modern French galante style, the German chorale of the first verse is heard in canon at the octave, almost subliminally, played in each hand together with the obligato instrumental solo. Bach had already mastered such a compound form in the choral fantasia opening his cantata Jesu, der du meine Seele, BWV 78. The canon could be {{a reference to the}} Law, the adherence to which Luther saw as one <b>of</b> the <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>prayer.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{traditional}} laguiole utilizes {{a single}} blade, but sometimes a corkscrew {{or some other}} implement is added. This necessitates an even slimmer cutaway handle, the shape of which is fancifully known as the [...] "ladys leg", the bolster at the base resembling a foot. A Shepherds Cross consisting of 6-8 inlaid metal pins forming a cross {{can be found on}} the handle of some laguioles from the end of the 19th century to the present day. This embellishment is a reference to a legend of Catholic shepherds in need of a cross for prayer during their seasonal migrations between the mountains and the plains. Far from any chapel or cathédrale, the shepherd would thrust his opened laguiole blade-down into the earth, exposing the visible cross on the handle for <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>prayer.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In the Muslim community, a frequently-reported {{religious}} {{perception is}} the image of the word [...] "Allah" [...] in Arabic on natural objects. Again, the discovery of such an object may attract considerable interest among believers who visit the object for the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>prayer</b> or veneration.

2500|$|In this approach, the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>prayer</b> is {{to enable}} the person praying to gain a direct {{experience}} of {{the recipient of the}} prayer (or as close to direct as a specific theology permits). This approach is very significant in Christianity and widespread in Judaism (although less popular theologically). In Eastern Orthodoxy, this approach is known as hesychasm. It is also widespread in Sufi Islam, and in some forms of mysticism. It has some similarities with the rationalist approach, since it can also involve contemplation, although the contemplation is not generally viewed as being as rational or intellectual. [...] Christian and Roman Catholic traditions also include an experiential approach to prayer within the practice of Lectio Divina, historically a Benedictine practice in which scripture is read aloud; actively meditated upon using the intellect (but not analysis) possibly using the mind to place the listener within a relationship or dialogue with the text that was read; a prayer spoken; and finally concludes with , a more passive experiential approach than the previous meditation, which is characterized by the Catechism of the Catholic Church as an experience of consciously being attentive, and having a silent love toward God, which the individual experiences without demanding to receive an experience. [...] The experience of God within Christian mysticism has been contrasted with the concept of experiential religion or mystical experience because of a long history or authors living and writing about experience with the divine in a manner that identifies God as unknowable and ineffable, the language of such ideas could be characterized paradoxically as [...] "experiential", as well as without the phenomena of experience.|$|E

60|$|There are {{one or two}} usages, especially, of the Romish church, {{that are}} not only beautiful, but which must be useful and salutary. One is the {{practice}} of leaving the church open at all hours, for the <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>prayer.</b> I have seldom entered one of these vaulted, vast, and appropriate Houses of God, without finding fewer or more devotees kneeling at the different altars. Another usage is that <b>of</b> periodical <b>prayer,</b> in the fields, or wherever the peasants may happen to be employed, as in the angelus, &c. I remember, with pleasure, the effect produced by the bell of the village church, as it sent its warning voice, on such occasions, across the plains, and over the hills, while we were dwellers in French or Italian hamlets. Of all these touching embellishments of life, America, and I had almost said, Protestantism, is naked; and in most cases, I {{think it will be}} found, on inquiry, naked without sufficient reason.|$|R
50|$|In Wallace v.

Rather, it ruled that Alabama lawmakers had passed the statute solely to advance religion, thereby violating the secular purpose test.|$|R

50|$|It was {{forbidden}} {{to go outside}} of one's dwelling on the Sabbath except for <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>prayer</b> or necessity. Anything that is ordinarily carried on the shoulders, owing to its size or weight, might not be carried around even in a room. Anan's law-book insists that the Sabbath evening (Friday) must be passed in darkness: lights kindled in the daytime on Friday must be extinguished at nightfall, for it is forbidden to pass the Sabbath in a place artificially illuminated. Cooking and baking must be done on Friday, not only for Friday and Saturday, but also for Saturday night, to forestall any impatient longing for {{the close of the}} Sabbath. Foods already prepared must not be kept warm, but eaten cold. Unleavened bread (Maẓẓah) must be made exclusively of barley-meal, and he that prepares it out of wheaten meal incurs the punishment appointed for those that eat actual leaven (ḥameẓ). Nor may this unleavened bread be baked in an oven, but, like the paschal lamb, it must be roasted on the coals.|$|R

50|$|Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith {{refers to}} two {{distinct}} concepts: obligatory prayer and supererogatory prayer (general prayer).

The second was founded by the then rector, William de Bosco, ‘‘to the honour of God and the Blessed Virgin Mary’’, and was in the present building.

50|$|In {{addition}} to general prayers, Bahá'u'lláh prescribed a daily obligatory prayer {{in his book}} of laws, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. The obligatory prayer is a primary religious obligation starting {{at the age of}} fifteen and it is the most important kind <b>of</b> <b>prayer.</b> The <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the obligatory <b>prayer</b> is to foster the development of humility and devotion. Unlike almost all other prayers in the Bahá'í Faith, there are specific regulations concerning the obligatory prayers; however, obligatory prayer is a personal spiritual obligation and thus no Bahá'í administrative sanction can be obtained if a Bahá'í fails to say his prayer daily.|$|R
