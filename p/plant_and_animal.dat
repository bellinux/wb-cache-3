5|$|The land {{beneath the}} Bay Area {{consists}} of layers {{of sand and}} clay to great depths.

5|$|The nuclear {{membrane}} contains a lipid bilayer that encompass {{the contents of}} the nucleus. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a synthesis and transport organelle that branches into the cytoplasm in <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> cells. The Golgi apparatus is a series of multiple compartments where molecules are packaged for delivery to other cell components or for secretion from the cell. Vacuoles, which are found in both <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> cells (though much bigger in plant cells), are responsible for maintaining the shape and structure of the cell as well as storing waste products. A vesicle is a relatively small, membrane-enclosed sac that stores or transports substances. The cell membrane is a protective barrier that regulates what enters and leaves the cell. There is also an organelle known as the Spitzenk√∂rper that is only found in fungi, and is connected with hyphal tip growth.|$|E
5|$|With 10 climatic regions, 14 soil {{regions and}} 11 {{distinct}} ecological regions, regional classification becomes problematic with differences in soils, topography, geology, rainfall, and <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> communities. One classification system divides Texas, in order from southeast to west, into the following: Gulf Coastal Plains, Interior Lowlands, Great Plains, and Basin and Range Province.|$|E
5|$|Although early humans {{gathered}} uncultivated {{plant materials}} {{for food and}} employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing, most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth {{has led to a}} significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> species as well as increased erosion.|$|E
40|$|Pesticide {{chemicals}} {{are an important}} component of modern agriculture. Through their use, <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> are exposed to pesticides directly and indirectly from transport through soil, water, and other environmental components. Pesticide chemicals which are absorbed by <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> undergo extensive biotransformation. Lipophilic compounds are converted to polar metabolites through a variety of microsomal and extramicrosomal reactions in <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals.</b> Generally, biotransformations are qualitatively similar in both systems. However, there are important quantitative rate differences in metabolism which often determine the balance between activation and deactivation of a pesticide. Furthermore, there are qualitative differences in conjugative mechanisms in <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals.</b> Animals through an efficient excretory system eliminate transformation products via the urine and feces. Since efficient excretory systems are absent in plants, terminal degradation products are stored as conjugates and/or derivatives whch may be incorporated into the plants themselves. Metabolic transformations of selected pesticides illustrating various types of reactions in <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>animals</b> are discussed. Pesticide {{chemicals are}} an integral component of modern farming. Energy conservation measures...|$|R
