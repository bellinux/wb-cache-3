Eastern cottonwood (Populous deltoides) was esterified by using acetic or propionic anhydride without using any solvent or catalyst under different conditions. Two different weight percentage gains (WPGs) were obtained for each of the modifying chemicals. Three main surface roughness parameters, namely average roughness (Ra), mean <b>peak</b> <b>to</b> <b>valley</b> <b>height</b> (Rz) and maximum roughess (Rmax) were measured by a stylus method before and after esterification.

40|$|The {{response}} surface methodology (RSM) coupled with central composite design (CCD) have been employed to design fatigue specimens of {{austenitic stainless steels}} with controlled surface characteristics, {{for the purpose of}} investigating the effects of machining-induced residual stresses and roughness on fatigue behaviour. Simple cylindrical specimens having various surface characteristics were first produced by changing the final cutting conditions (spindle speed, feed rate and cutting depth) of the lathe. The fitting of the {{response surface}} model for the data was studied by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The response surface model employed in the analysis adequately represented the largest <b>peak</b> <b>to</b> <b>valley</b> <b>height</b> (roughness Ry) and the axial residual stress, although a good fit was not always achieved on the responses of the mean spacing of adjacent local peaks (roughness S) and the microhardness. Fatigue specimens were then prepared for several surface conditions, selected by interpolation of the response surface model, and the predictions were successfully compared with experiments. This approach to prepare fatigue specimens of austenitic stainless steels can form the basis of a systematic study of the effect of surface preparation parameters on fatigue behaviour. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|Our study aims to {{implement}} a strategy to reduce the carbon steel corrosion rate in a sulfuric acid solution, using an expired drug with adsorption affinity on the metal surface. To investigate the corrosion protection efficiency of an environmental friendly inhibitor, namely neomycin sulfate (NMS), the electrochemical measurements were applied on carbon steel immersed in 1. 0 M H 2 SO 4 solution with and without NMS. The protective layer that formed on the steel surface was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed {{that the presence of}} the neomycin sulfate in acid solution leads to the decrease in corrosion current density (icorr) and the increase of polarization resistance (Rp). The mixed mechanism between physical and chemical adsorption of NMS molecules on the steel surface was proposed according to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm.

Experimental castings were prepared in moulds made of two types of plaster. Cast temperatures were 1120 and 1200 °C for bronzes and 700 and 800 °C for silumin. Temperatures of the mould were 500 and 600 °C for bronzes and 200 and 300 °C for aluminum alloy. The roughness measurements were carried out with use of Hommelwerke Tester T 1000.

40|$|Polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon) {{currently}} {{serves as}} the primary material for solar cells in the photovoltaic industry. The material is cast into large ingots, which are cut with a band saw into smaller ingots (i. e. bricks). The bricks are then sliced into wafers with a wire saw. Damage is introduced within the wafers during these processes. If sufficient, the damage can cause brittle failure during the sawing processes, or in handling during further processing downstream. In this study, the surface quality of eight polycrystalline silicon bricks cast at BP Solar and exhibiting a characteristic quality was investigated using contact profilometry. The bricks were then returned to BP Solar where they were sliced into wafers. Wafers {{from each of the}} eight bricks were collected and the surface topography of the wafer surface and wafer edges was examined using white light interferometry. In addition, mechanical properties of the wafers were determined using biaxial flexure and a novel edge flexure test. Fractography revealed that wafers failed from either surface flaws introduced during wire saw sectioning or edge flaws introduced during band saw sectioning. In edge flexure, the wafer strength ranged from 135 to 158 MPa. Fractography revealed that flaws from wafers tested in edge flexure ranged from 10 to 50 &mum in depth.

40|$|Surface {{roughness}} affects {{bone formation}} around orthopaedic implants in vivo and osteoblast functions in vitro. Osteoblast-like MG 63 cells cultured on rough surfaces exhibited decreased cell number, increased differentiation and increased local factor production {{when compared to}} cells grow on smooth surfaces. In these experiments, roughness was characterized as average <b>peak</b> <b>to</b> <b>valley</b> <b>height</b> (Ra) which is not equal throughout the surface. Other features of roughness, including peak and valley area distributions and curvature of the valleys, will affect cell functions. In this study, novel titanium surfaces were prepared by photolithography to produce well designed microstructure and nanostructure. Smooth disks were made by producing craters of 10 micrometer, 30 micrometer and 100 micrometer diameters on titanium disks with constant curvatures. Craters were placed sparsely (10 / 1, 30 / 1, 100 / 1) or compactly (10 / 6, 30 / 6, 100 / 6). Smooth disks were also acid etched to make an overall roughness of Ra 0. 7 micrometer or anodized to produce volcano-like nanostructure of Ra 0. 4 micrometer. The results revealed the distinguishing contributions of microcrater size, crater spacing and nanostructures to surface effect on cell number, differentiation (alkaline phosphatase; osteocalcin) and local factor levels (TGF-beta 1; PGE 2). Cell attachment depends on crater spacing; cell growth and aggregation depend on crater dimension and cell morphology depends {{on the presence of}} nanostructural features. Cell differentiation and local factor production are modulated by acid etched roughness in concert with microstructure, and active TGF-beta 1 level depends on nanoscale roughness. M. S.

40|$|Products with {{complicated}} shapes require superior {{surface finish}} {{to perform the}} intended function. Despite significant developments in technology, finishing operations are still performed semi automatically/manually, relying on {{the skills of the}} machinist. The pressure to produce products at the best quality in the shortest lead time has made it highly inconvenient to depend on traditional methods. Thus, there is a rising need for automation which has become a resource to remain competitive in the manufacturing industry. Diminishing return of trading quality over time in finishing operations signifies the importance of having a pre-determined trajectory (tool path) that produces an optimum surface in the least possible machining time. Tool path optimization for finishing process considering tool kinematics is of relatively low importance in the present scenario. The available automation in grinding processes encompass around the dynamics of machining. In this paper we provide an overview of optimizing the tool path using evolutionary algorithms, considering the significance of process dynamics and kinematics. Process efficiency of the generated tool movements are studied based on the evaluation of relative importance of the finishing parameters. Surface quality is analysed using MATLAB and optimization is performed on account of <b>peak</b> <b>to</b> <b>valley</b> <b>height.</b> Surface removal characteristics are analysed based on process variables that have the most likely impact on surface finish. The research results indicated that tool path is the most significant parameter determining the surface quality of a finishing operation.

Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare, in vitro, the {{resistance}} to sliding generated by conventional, active self-ligating and passive self-ligating brackets with stainless steel and nickel-titanium wires and to evaluate the effect of binding upon resistance to sliding In addition to this, the influence of bracket´s slot surface characteristics on measured friction was estimated. Materials and Methods: The following 0, 022 inch slot brackets were essayed: Damon® Q™, Prodigy SL™ (Sybron Dental Specialties Ormco™, Orange, California, USA), Smart-Clip™SL 3, Victory Series™ (3 M Unitek Orthodontic Products, Monrovia, California, USA), Morelli® Roth Standard and Morelli® Roth SLI (Morelli Ortodontia, Sorocaba, São Paulo, Brazil). These brackets were coupled with either 0. 016 x 0. 022 inch stainless steel (Dentaurum GmbH, Ispringen, Germany) or nickel-titanium (DM Ceosa, Madrid, Spain) archwires. Alicona InfiniteFocus® optical 3 -dimensional micro coordinate system (Alicona Imaging GmbH, Grambach/Graz, Austria) and Alicona IFM version 3. 5. 1. 5 software (Alicona Imaging GmbH, Grambach/Graz, Austria) were used for assessing roughness average, root mean square and mean <b>peak</b> <b>to</b> <b>valley</b> <b>height</b> of roughness profile of slot surface. For Damon brackets, a slot profile analysis was executed in order to evaluate the contact areas between bracket and archwire Results: Statistically significant higher resistance to sliding is observed in conventional brackets comparing to passive and active self-ligating brackets. No statistically significant differences were found between passive and active self-ligating brackets and between archwire materials in 0 degrees angulations. For 5 degrees angulations, stainless steel showed statistically significant higher resistance to sliding. No statistically significant differences in resistance to sliding were found between 0 and 5 degrees of bracket tipping. Higher values of roughness average and root mean square were correlated with friction forces lower than 3 N while lower roughness values were associated with higher frictional forces. In Damon brackets, the embossed numbers in the slot are not likely to contact with the archwire since they are approximately 5. 5 μm lower than the lateral boxes. Conclusion: Self-ligating brackets are helpful for obtaining low frictional forces. When coupled with a small rectangular archwire, slight bracket angulations or tooth tipping may not influence resistance to sliding. However, different alloys reveal dissimilar frictional behavior when angulations are present. Surface roughness seems to have an inverse correlation with frictional forces...|$|E
40|$|A tendência da fabricação de moldes e matrizes é utilizar a tecnologia de usinagem HSM (High Speed Machining), pois esta pode produzir superfícies com melhor qualidade. Isto é possível, pois pode-se aumentar o número de passes laterais de um molde, sem que haja perdas de tempo de ciclo de usinagem, melhorando assim a qualidade do produto. No entanto, com a crescente utilização desta tecnologia, o perfil gerado de uma superfície usinada com uma fresa de ponta esférica, é alterado. Isto ocorre porque, normalmente, é possível medir-se a rugosidade em duas direções, obtendo-se em cada uma delas um valor de rugosidade máxima: um é o pico (crista) entre passes laterais e o outro é a altura de crista entre avanços por dente sucessivos. Cada um deles tem maior importância em função dos parâmetros utilizados. Estudar os fatores que alteram o perfil de rugosidade se faz, portanto, necessário. O objetivo deste trabalho é verificar experimentalmente como os parâmetros de usinagem: avanço por dente, passe lateral, diâmetro da ferramenta, ângulo de inclinação do eixo axial da ferramenta de corte e direção de corte (unidirecional ou bidirecional) influenciam o perfil de rugosidade e a rugosidade máxima, além de criar um modelo matemático que possa prever estas alterações. Foi mostrado neste trabalho que o perfil de rugosidade para corte unidirecional é diferente do corte bidirecional, e que, à medida que a relação entre avanço por aresta e passe lateral cresce, a rugosidade máxima também aumenta. Mas, ao se inclinar o eixo axial da ferramenta e aumentar o diâmetro da fresa esférica a rugosidade máxima diminui. Em resumo, este trabalho visa mostrar quais são os fatores que influenciam o acabamento de superfícies usinadas com fresas de topo esférico em condições, cuja relação entre o passe lateral e avanço por dente são típicas da HSM. The {{trend in}} molds and dies {{manufacturing}} {{is the use}} of the HSM (High Speed Machining) technology, since it is able to produce surfaces with a better quality. This is possible because the number of radial passes, can be increased without lossing in the machining cycle times, enhancing the product quality. But with the arising utilization of this technology, the generated profile in a surface machined with a ball nose end milling cutter is changed. This happens because, it is usually possible to measure the surface roughness in two directions, getting in each of them a maximum surface roughness value: {{one of them is the}} <b>peak</b> <b>to</b> <b>valley</b> <b>height</b> between radial passes and the other one is the same parameter between successive feed per tooth. Each of them has major importance depending on the used cutting parameters. To study the factors that change the surface roughness profile is, therefore, necessary. The goal of this work is experimentally verify how the cutting parameters: feed per tooth, radial pass, tool diameter, spindle inclination angle and cutting direction (unidirectional or bidirectional) influences the surface roughness profile and the peak to valley roughness, besides of creating a mathematical model able to predict these changes. It was showed in this work that the surface roughness profile generated in a unidirectional cut is different of the profile generated in a bidirectional cut and that, as the ratio between feed per tooth and radial pass increases the same happens with the peak to valley surface roughness. But when the spindle is tilt and the ball nose cutting tool diameter is bigger the surface roughness decreases. This work aims to show which are the factors that influences the finishing of surfaces milled with ball nose end milling cutters using conditions whose ratio between the radial pass and feed per tooth are typical of HSM...|$|E
