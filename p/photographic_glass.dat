50|$|Over 40,000 of Wilson's <b>photographic</b> <b>glass</b> plates {{still exist}} today, {{largely due to}} the meticulous washing and {{chemical}} treatments he insisted on. Aberdeen University is in possession of some 38,000 of these, which were donated by an Aberdeen photographer, the late Archie Strachan, in 1958. They date from the late 1850s down to {{the early years of the}} 20th century and cover not only Aberdeen and the North East but the whole of Scotland and most of England, as well as parts of Wales and Northern Ireland, Gibraltar, Morocco including Tangier, the South of Spain, and (especially) colonial South Africa and Australia.|$|E

Soon his responsibilities included handmaking (coating and sensitizing) of the <b>photographic</b> <b>glass</b> negative plates. At the age of twenty Bulla opened a small factory producing [...] "momentary dry bromine-gelatin plates". Buying the readymade photographic materials was much more convenient than handmaking their own and soon Bulla's plates became popular, selling not only in St.Petersburg but across the whole Russian Empire.In February 1876 Bulla requested his naturalization and in July 1876 became a subject of the Russian Empire.|$|E

50|$|The observatory's {{principle}} {{telescope was}} a 40-inch (1.0 meter) Cassegrain reflector by Astro Mechanics Inc. The telescope itself cost about $244,000, {{most of that}} money coming from a National Science Foundation grant. The dome was 40-foot in diameter and connected to a main building that housed an apartment for astronomers. The telescope had an off-axis equatorial mount and was equipped for direct photography, spectroscopy, and photoelectric photometry. Most of the 80 research papers produced over the 11-years life of the observatory used a multicolor single-channel photometer. The <b>photographic</b> <b>glass</b> slides produced by the camera and the spectrograph are now stored in the university archives (series number 15/3/13).|$|E
5000|$|The Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS II) got {{underway}} in August 1985, {{with the first}} of the 14" [...] <b>photographic</b> <b>glass</b> plates being pulled off the Palomar's Samuel Oschin telescope (then called the 48-inch Schmidt Camera). Jean Mueller was hired as the 48-Inch Night Assistant in July of that year, and worked in the capacity as observer and telescope operator for the duration. She took over 5500 photographic plates and had the honor of setting the telescope and removing the very last plate from the historic Schmidt Camera on June 3, 2000, as well as discovering her very last supernova, 2000cm, on that same night.|$|E
50|$|About half of {{the large}} <b>photographic</b> <b>glass</b> plate negatives exposed on the telescope, some 19,000 in all, had been accumulating in the sub-basement of the Robinson {{building}} at the California Institute of Technology since 1949. In 2002, astronomer Jean Mueller approached Richard Ellis, {{the director of the}} Caltech Optical Observatories, to volunteer to the task of organizing the Oschin Telescope plate archive. Given the go-ahead, she recruited eleven volunteers from the Mount Wilson Observatory Association (MWOA) and the Los Angeles Astronomical Society (LAAS), and the team then spent 13 weekends (more than one thousand hours) poring over the stacks, placing plates in protective sleeves, and packing them in more than 500 boxes that were transported to Palomar.|$|E

50|$|Although the UKST was {{originally}} {{used to take}} photographs of the sky, traditional <b>photographic</b> <b>glass</b> (and film) became largely superseded by large electronic CCD detectors in the late 1990s, and after 2000 the UKST was used mostly for multi-object spectroscopy with the 6 degree Field (6dF) instrument. 6dF uses a robot to position up to 150 optical fibres on a metal plate mounted at the focal plane of the UKST, which then carry light from the targets to a spectrograph which sits {{on the floor of}} the dome. The 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS), a redshift survey of 120,000 infrared-selected galaxies was completed in 2005, and from 2003-2013 the UKST then carried out the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) to measure the radial velocities and metallicities of around to 0.5 million stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.|$|E
50|$|It took {{little time}} for Candy to {{position}} the Perth Observatory {{at the forefront of}} southern cometary astrometry. By 1972, the Perth Observatory was 9th in the world in producing cometary positions. Not content with this, Candy introduced new <b>photographic</b> <b>glass</b> plate processing practices to increase the limiting magnitude of objects achievable at that time from 14th to 19th. The new processes were to see the recovery of five comets and the positioning of the Observatory to 2nd place between 1973 and 1977 and 4th between 1978 and 1984, resulting in him being awarded the prestigious Merlin Medal of the British Astronomical Association in 1975. Under his direction the Perth Observatory discovered over 100 new asteroids as well as contributing a significant number of observations to the Minor Planet Center.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{sequences}} of photographs in such devices was initially {{limited to a}} few experiments with subjects photographed {{in a series of}} poses because the available emulsions were not sensitive enough to allow the short exposures needed to photograph subjects that were actually moving. The sensitivity was gradually improved and in the late 1870s, Eadweard Muybridge created the first animated image sequences photographed in real-time. A row of cameras was used, each, in turn, capturing one image on a <b>photographic</b> <b>glass</b> plate, so the total number of images in each sequence was limited by the number of cameras, about two dozen at most. Muybridge used his system to analyze the movements {{of a wide variety of}} animal and human subjects. Hand-painted images based on the photographs were projected as moving images by means of his zoopraxiscope.|$|E

5000|$|The {{history of}} Queensland spans {{thousands}} of years, encompassing both a lengthy indigenous presence, {{as well as}} the eventful times of post-European settlement. The north-eastern Australian region was explored by Dutch, Spanish and French navigators before being encountered by Lieutenant James Cook in 1770. The state has witnessed frontier warfare between European settlers and Indigenous inhabitants (which did not result in any settlement or treaty), {{as well as the}} exploitation of cheap Kanaka labour sourced from the South Pacific through a form of forced recruitment known at the time as [...] "blackbirding". The Australian Labor Party has its origin as a formal organisation in Queensland and the town of Barcaldine is the symbolic birthplace of the party. June 2009 marked the 150th anniversary of its creation as a separate colony from New South Wales.

40|$|Retouching {{glass plate}} negatives was a {{practice}} that emerged {{about the same time}} as the glass plate negative itself. How was photography being retouched in the early 20 th century? Today there are generally available known digital tools. A hundred years ago, the retouching was done by hand, by the photographer, or by specific professionals that don’t distance themselves, in technical demand, of the arts of drawing and painting. But the retouching was invisible in the final object, because the changes were done on the negative. Its contemporary books, in the form of manuals, are a window to the past telling us about the techniques and materials used. Existing archive collections of <b>photographic</b> <b>glass</b> plate negatives are testimony to the expertise of photographers and the practical use of those books. The present work will show examples of tools and materials used for retouching of <b>photographic</b> <b>glass</b> plate negatives, taking as an example a portrait collection at the Photographic Archive of Lisbon. Also some considerations are done about the conservation of retouched glass plate negatives in archive collections. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|This {{project began}} in September 2001 with the re-discovery {{of an old}} archive in the Institute of Archaeology (Oxford University). The archive {{consists}} {{of a collection of}} hand-painted glass (lantern) slides that depicted the "Megalithic Monuments of Great Britain," dating to 1897 - 5 and attributed to H. M. J. Underhill. The slides showed the stone circles at Stonehenge, Avebury, Stanton Drew and the Rollright Stones. Miscellaneous slides depicted other prehistoric monuments: Menhir at Dartmoor and the Sarsen Stones and Wayland's Smithy on the Oxfordshire Ridgeway. Since September 2001, more lantern slides in the Institute's collections have been attributed to Underhill on different subjects: Romano-British city remains (Bath, Colchester, Silchester and Wroxeter) and the vernacular architecture of windmills. The researchers, Megan Price and Deborah Harlan, used primary sources in the Bodleian Library Modern Manuscripts Collection and the Centre for Oxfordshire Studies to uncover much biographical information on Henry Michael John Underhill. We have also located further archives in the United Kingdom that hold Underhill material. The Underhill archive consists of 78 hand-painted glass slides and 17 <b>photographic</b> <b>glass</b> lantern slides. Each slide measures 3. 25 inches square...|$|E

40|$|During {{the nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries, the Spurling {{photographic}} firm made a significant contribution to photography in Tasmania. However, over the years, fact and fiction about the Spurlings became confused. Their photographs became dispersed and inaccessible. Then, in the late 1970 s a series of co-incidences led to the re-discovery {{of a large number of}} <b>photographic</b> <b>glass</b> plates. Some Spurling-related research commenced and then lapsed. Since then, with the exception of a few dedicated investigators, the Spurlings' contribution to Australian photography has remained largely untold. The task of this research was to redress this situation by locating, worldwide, as many Spurling images as possible, to catalogue and date them, and then to investigate relevant contextual information. This data was then placed into an historical and social framework. The thesis examines the careers of the three generations of Spurling photographers [...] Stephen 1 st, his two photographer sons Stephen 2 nd and Frederick, and his grandson Stephen 3 rd. It describes and analyses their cumulative photographic achievements from the early 1840 s through to 1941, and traces their move from portraiture through to scenic, and ultimately wilderness photography. It also examines Stephen 3 rd's significant wilderness treks and looks at the artistic and photographic conventions that influenced the ways in which the Spurlings depicted the landscape. Other subjects considered include issues surrounding the production of these images, and how wilderness photography can play an important role in alerting the public to environmental conservation. By examining these issues, this thesis adds significantly to the current literature on Australian photographic history. Although many photo-historians refer to the Spurlings, most have either overlooked or dismissed the significance of the Spurlings' photographic legacy, or provided only brief overviews. This thesis argues that while some of the factors that led to the Spurlings' virtual disappearance from the historical record were due to external influences and prejudices, the Spurlings themselves did little to record their history for posterity. This was due in part to modesty, but also a desire to keep family secrets hidden. This thesis concludes with a call for more accurate, unbiased and data-driven accounts of early Tasmanian photography, and a re-assessment of the Spurlings' place in Australian photographic history...|$|E
