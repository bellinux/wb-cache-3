50|$|Pumps {{typically}} have an inlet where the fluid enters the pump {{and an outlet}} where the fluid comes out. The inlet location {{is said to be}} at the suction side of the pump. The outlet location is said to be at the discharge side of the <b>pump.</b> <b>Operation</b> of the pump creates suction (a lower pressure) at the suction side so that fluid can enter the pump through the inlet. <b>Pump</b> <b>operation</b> also causes higher pressure at the discharge side by forcing the fluid out at the outlet. There may be pressure sensing devices at the pump's suction and/or discharge sides which control the operation of the pump. For example, if the suction pressure of a centrifugal pump is too low, a device may trigger the pump to shut off to keep it from running dry; i. e. with no fluid entering.|$|E

The comparison of results shows that the optimisation of variable speed pumps can lead to more effective pump controls, especially when the demand variability is larger. In addition, <b>pump</b> <b>operations</b> are optimised taking into account a seasonal temporal resolution: results show up to 12. 5 % in possible savings, highlighting the importance of considering seasonality in the optimisation of <b>pump</b> <b>operations.</b> Angela Marchi, Angus R.

5000|$|It is {{possible}} to induce a DC current by applying a bias, or if the particles are charged then by applying an electro-motive-force. In contrast to that a quantum pumping mechanism produces a DC current {{in response to a}} cyclic deformation of the confining potential. In order to have a DC current from an AC driving, time reversal symmetry (TRS) should be broken. In the absence of magnetic field and dissipation it is the driving itself that can break TRS. Accordingly, an adiabatic <b>pump</b> <b>operation</b> is based on varying more than one parameter, while for non-adiabatic pumps [...] modulation of a single parameter may suffice for DC current generation. The best known example is the peristaltic mechanism that combines a cyclic squeezing operation with on/off switching of entrance/exit valves.|$|E
50|$|A {{circulating}} pump - {{a device that}} causes the flow of liquid (e.g. water or aqueous solutions, mostly glycol) in circuits (primary or secondary) of heating or cooling installations. The {{circulating pump}}s are used only as centrifugal pumps. The basic elements of the centrifugal pump are coiled housing with two ports, suction and discharge, and what is more, blade rotor mounted on a shaft driven be an electric motor. The ports of the circulating pump can be arranged in one axis (in-line circulating pump, typically suitable to be built directly in the pipeline) or suction axis that can be perpendicular to the axis of discharge port (the so-called circulating radial pump). The mechanical energy delivered to the circulating pump via motor is transmitted through the rotor to the liquid flow causing the increase in pressure (potential energy) and speed (kinetic energy). The energy increase of the liquid occurs only in the circulating pump rotor, {{which is the only}} element of the energy transmission. However, in the remaining parts, one type of energy changes into another e.g. kinetic energy into pressure energy. For instance, in the coiled shaped housing, part of kinetic energy changes into potential energy, which causes a further increase in the fluid pressure.Pressure generated by the pump is used to overcome resistance of the liquid flow through the heating or cooling circuit. During the <b>pump</b> <b>operation,</b> there is a drop of the liquid flow {{in the center of the}} rotor, causing the inflow of the liquid through the suction port. In the event of an excessive pressure decrease, in some parts of the rotor, the pressure can be lower than the saturation pressure corresponding to the temperature of the pumped liquid, causing the so-called cavitation, i.e. liquid evaporation. To prevent this, the pressure in the suction port (at the inlet of the pump) should be higher than the saturation pressure corresponding to the liquid temperature by the net positive suction head (NPSH).|$|E

40|$|While water {{distribution}} systems (WDSs) form {{an integral part}} of modern cities, it is desirable to minimize the considerable costs that can be associated with their design and <b>pumping</b> <b>operations.</b> However, WDSs are complex systems and complete enumeration of all possible alternative solutions as a way of minimizing costs is generally not possible. As such, formal optimization algorithms have become a popular way to minimize the cost of WDSs within reasonable computational timeframes. Another important objective, minimizing the environmental impact of WDSs, has only more recently been considered. Human-induced climate change caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions {{has become one of the}} most significant problems faced by human-kind. Water distribution systems contribute to the release of GHG emissions through both their design/construction and <b>pumping</b> <b>operations.</b> When electricity used for pumping purposes is generated by fossil fuel generation sources, a significant amount of GHG emissions can be released over the project life of a WDS. This occurs to the extent where the majority of GHG emissions can be associated with electricity consumed for pumping purposes. However, within the literature considering the minimization of costs and GHG emissions associated with WDSs, most research has focused on design optimization, with less consideration being given to the <b>pumping</b> <b>operations</b> of a WDS. Therefore, there remains a need to consider the important aspects of <b>pumping</b> <b>operations</b> so that their associated costs and GHG emissions can be evaluated with the same level of accuracy as those associated with the design of a WDS. Consequently, this research incorporates the elements that are necessary to accurately evaluate costs and GHG emissions associated with the <b>pumping</b> <b>operations</b> of WDS into a single framework for the minimization of costs and GHG emissions. The major research contributions are presented in four journal publications. Firstly, the {{water distribution}} cost-emissions nexus (WCEN) conceptual framework is presented, which represents the nexus of elements required to accurately model and evaluate costs and GHG emissions when optimizing the design and <b>pumping</b> <b>operation</b> of a WDS. Secondly, in order to facilitate the practical application of these concepts, the WCEN computational software framework, which combines hydraulic simulation with multi-objective heuristic optimization, is presented. In particular, the WCEN computational software framework allows the design and <b>pumping</b> <b>operations</b> of a WDS to be optimized while considering both the short and long-term time-dependency of operational conditions, such as emissions factors associated with electricity generation, of which generally only average values have been considered. Thirdly, a methodology for calculating time-dependent emissions factors from electricity generation data is presented. Finally, a study on the effect of water storage tank size on the optimal design and <b>pumping</b> <b>operations</b> of a WDS is presented. While other design parameters can affect the costs and GHG emissions of WDS, storage tank size has been given little consideration in the past, especially when the time-dependency of emissions factors is also considered. It is hoped that this research will lead to the greater consideration of minimizing both costs and GHG emissions when developing designs and pumping operational management strategies for WDSs in the real world.

40|$|In this report, {{we examine}} several {{long-term}} issues: {{the effect of}} <b>pump</b> <b>operation</b> on future gas release events (GREs), uncontrolled chemical reactions, chronic toxic gas releases, foaming, and erosion and corrosion. Heat load {{in excess of the}} design limit, uncontrolled chemical reactions, chronic toxic gas releases, foaming, and erosion and corrosion have been shown not to be safety concerns. The effect of <b>pump</b> <b>operation</b> on future GREs could not be quantified. The problem with evaluating the long-term effects of <b>pump</b> <b>operation</b> on GREs is a lack of knowledge and uncertainty. In particular, the phenomena governing gas retention, particle size distribution, and settling are not well understood, nor are the interactions among these factors understood. There is a possibility that changes in these factors could increase the size of future GREs. Bounding estimates of the potential increase in size of GREs are not possible {{because of a lack of}} engineering data. Proper management of the hazards can reduce, but not eliminate, the possibility of undesirable changes. Maintaining temperature within the historical limits can reduce the possibility of undesirable changes.

40|$|AbstractOptimal pump {{scheduling}} {{is a major}} consideration {{when dealing}} with minimizing operational costs of a water distribution system. <b>Pump</b> <b>operation</b> must balance between three factors. Water balance constraints, including consumer demand and water tank volumes. Hydraulic constraints determining water pump operating point. Electrical tariff rate effecting energy cost. Optimization models may assume linear or discrete <b>pump</b> <b>operation,</b> depending on type and accuracy of the model in use. Linear operation assumes the pump may operate during {{part of the time}} step while discrete operation requires the pump to be either on or off during the entire time step. Linear optimization models commonly have short solution times, but cannot contain non-linear constraints such as hydraulic headloss. By such, linear model results may be difficult to implement in a real water system as the hydraulic behavior of the system may render the optimal solution impractical. Likewise, if the <b>pump</b> <b>operation</b> partially uses the time step the pump may be forced to come in and out of duty often causing mechanical ware and tare. Discrete operation provides smooth <b>pump</b> <b>operation</b> and may contain non-linear hydraulic constraint to calculate a more realistic working point for the pump. Discrete models have long solution times due the vast amount of pump operating combinations, which must be explored. Heuristic techniques may be used to shorten solution times but these do not assure global minimization of the solution. The goal of the research is to create a minimum cost optimal operation water distribution system model that utilizes the short solution time of a linear model but also includes non-linear hydraulic constraints effecting pump energy consumption and discrete <b>pump</b> <b>operation.</b> The motivation is to use the model for real-time pump scheduling and for water system design...|$|E

The role of the front-pond to regulate {{the difference between the}} rates of inflowand outflow through pump station and to mitigate the intermittent pump operation,is being more important to cope with the increase of pumping capacity caused byurbanization or conversion of paddy field to upland field in a low-lying basin.
