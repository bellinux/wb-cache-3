50|$|All {{branches}} of the U.S. Armed Forces implement field training exercises into their basic military training courses for enlistees and officers.

The purpose of this is to give soon-to-be soldiers a taste of battle before they leave basic training. This also allows instructors to look for mistakes and correct them before their recruits become active duty and potentially go to battle.|$|E

40|$|A 69 -year-old man {{presented}} with multiple spontaneous bruises in the <b>past</b> 2 <b>weeks.</b> <b>Several</b> large-sized hematomas {{were found on}} examination. The initial investigation revealed a prolonged {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (aPTT) with normal platelet count and international normalized ratio. Further investigation revealed a low factor VIII activity secondary to presence of factor VIII inhibitor, making the diagnosis of acquired hemophilia A. Further work-up revealed that pernicious anemia was present and acted as an associated disease. After steroids therapy, his aPTT was normalized and the factor VIII inhibitor titer became undetectable. 2 months later, a relapse occurred and new hematomas appeared at his retropharyngeal space and left arm. His bleeding was controlled by administration of recombinant factor VIIa, and a combined therapy of intravenous steroids and rituximab was given to eradicate the inhibitor. The approach to workup of bleeding disorders as well as treatment of acquired hemophilia A are herein discussed...|$|R

40|$|The City of London and the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority {{contracted}} Biotactic Incorporated {{to design}} and conduct a study to collect baseline data related to fish movement at the Springbank dam in the spring before stop logs are installed and the dam is operated. These baseline data are {{to be used to}} address provincial and federal directives pertaining to the maintenance or enhancement of the status quo of fish movement at the Springbank dam. Radio-telemetry was used to track the movement of sixty radiotagged white suckers, shorthead redhorse and smallmouth bass at the Springbank dam from April 13 2006 to June 27 2006 (twenty fish of each species) to establish a data set related to fish movement at the dam. All fish were collected from areas upstream from the dam and released downstream after radio-tag implantation. The vast majority of all fish passed the dam with no apparent difficulty. The two catostomid species (early migrating white suckers and mid season migrating shorthead redhorse) that were monitored, rapidly approached and passed the dam, and some individuals returned downstream <b>past</b> the dam <b>several</b> <b>weeks</b> after upstream migration.

50|$|Several days later, Reese {{leaves a}} faculty meeting {{as a result}} of the rest of the faculty's {{attempts}} to put all the blame on Malley for the violence and unrest of the <b>past</b> <b>several</b> <b>weeks.</b> A drunk Fr.

Penny goes to bed, Reese gets the urge to deliberately cut his hand on a piece of glass. Dobbs comes storming out of the meeting and talks with Reese while patching up his hand. Reese shows his displeasure that the administration has elected Malley as their scapegoat, and says, much to Dobbs confusion, that there is something else in the school scaring him, even though Malley hasn't been at school in three days. During this conversation a beaten-up Carre is thrown off the balcony in the faculty room, down the stairs, and to Reese and Dobbs, much to the latter's shock.|$|E

50|$|Tampa Bay upset Minnesota {{to leave}} the Houston Oilers as the league's only winless team. Wilder's 75-yard third-quarter run gave the Buccaneers the lead for good, and was the longest run play in team history. His 219 yards broke Ricky Bell's single-game team record of 167, and were the second most yards ever gained against the Vikings, behind Walter Payton's NFL single-game record 275 in 1977. David Logan scored the first touchdown, a 54-yard return of a fumble caused by a Lee Roy Selmon sack of Steve Dils. This was Logan's third career fumble-return touchdown, one short of the NFL record. Ted Brown left the game after {{injuring}} his shoulder while scoring the Vikings' only touchdown. Steve Dils was hospitalized overnight after a hard hit left him disoriented. Gene Sanders, Lee Roy Selmon, Jimmie Giles, Randy Grimes, and Hugh Green all left the game with injuries. Selmon's injury {{was the result of}} an illegal chop block to the knee, one play after his sack of Dils. Some observers had predicted the upset, given the Buccaneers' performance through three quarters of the previous week's game, and the Vikings' struggles over the <b>past</b> <b>several</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E

Accordingly, the evidence developed in the investigation will be presented to an Ontario County grand jury in the near future.“As grand jury proceedings in New York State are strictly confidential by law, I am unable to state when the matter will be scheduled, other than to state that I intend to present the matter in the near future.
