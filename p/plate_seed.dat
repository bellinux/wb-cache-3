40|$|Conventional lithographic {{techniques}} are typically {{used for the}} fabrication of three-dimensional multilayer structures such as micro-inductors and microactuators. In this work a novel approach based exclusively on laser micromachining of dry film resists and electroplating is presented. The process involves seed layer deposition, lamination of dry film resist, laser micromachining and electroplating to mould the resist patterns. The process is then repeated, using intermediate <b>plating</b> <b>seed</b> layers if necessary, to realize the three-dimensional coil structure. The steps for sacrificial material removal involve laser patterning and chemical removal of resist and <b>plating</b> <b>seed</b> layers. The major advantages with this process are that it has fewer steps compared to conventional UV-based processing technology, and it utilizes the benefits of dry film resist processing using the laser. A three-layer micro-inductor coil was designed and fabricated using the new laser micromachining-based processing technology. The problems encountered during fabrication and possible actions to address them are discussed. This work reports the first multilayer structure that has been fabricated exclusively using laser ablation for the patterning of resist. Furthermore, this work reports the first structural layer that has been fabricated using laser ablation of resist to expose an underlying intermediate <b>plating</b> <b>seed</b> layer...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} carried out to analyze the dynamic {{characteristics}} of the <b>seed</b> <b>plate</b> which is {{the main part of}} the vacuum precision planter. The vacuum precision planter is a working machine which is attached to a tractor. The vacuum pump is operated by PTO-shaft which rotates in three types; 540 rpm (9 Hz), 750 rpm(12. 5 Hz) and 1, 000 rpm(16 Hz). Seeds are sucked into the holes of the <b>seed</b> <b>plate</b> by vacuum, and then they are transported by rotation. At that time, the mode shape of <b>seed</b> <b>plate</b> is important because dynamic characteristics of the <b>seed</b> <b>plate</b> decide <b>seeding</b> rates. If the natural frequency of <b>seed</b> <b>plate</b> corresponds with the frequency of PTO-shaft, the resonance occurs. For this reason, modal analysis of the <b>seed</b> <b>plate</b> was made with FlexPDE(PDE solutions, inc) and ANSYS(ANSYS, inc). Mode shape was observed for 5 th mode. First, modal analysis of the <b>seed</b> <b>plate</b> was performed by FlexPDE. According to the result of FlexPDE, natural frequency of each mode was obtained 35. 7 Hz, 35. 8 Hz, 45. 3 Hz, 60. 8 Hz and 61. 0 Hz respectively. The other modal analysis of the <b>seed</b> <b>plate</b> was performed by ANSYS. As a result of the ANSYS analysis, natural frequency of each mode was obtained 35. 6 Hz, 36. 0 Hz, 45. 6 Hz, 60. 9 Hz and 61. 1 Hz respectively. The results of the FlexPDE and ANSYS were similar. Natural frequency of the <b>seed</b> <b>plate</b> was confirmed by the above results. So, it was confirmed that the resonance didn't happen by comparing the frequency of PTO-shaft and natural frequency of <b>seed</b> <b>plate.</b> In conclusion, the vacuum precision planter is expected to efficiently sow...|$|R

Gravid worms (that have laid eggs) were washed off the NGM plate using K-medium (50  mM NaCl and 30  mM KCl).

The LODs of the 10 substances were highest on the <b>plates</b> <b>seeded</b> with B. cereus, intended for selective detection of tetracycline residues.

Nine of 10 quinolones were detected easier with E. coli, but the LOD of difloxacin was lower with B. subtilis.

40|$|Purpose. To report {{one case}} of corneal {{antibiotic}} deposition after ciprofloxacin administration in Laser Assisted Subepithelial Keratomileusis (LASEK). Methods. One case of post-LASEK treatment resulted in corneal precipitates and poor wound healing.
