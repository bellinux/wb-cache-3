Prices are modeled as diffusions and the market is incomplete. We find an explicit solution for the case of limited diversification of the portfolio, i. e. for the <b>portfolio</b> <b>compression</b> problem. By this we mean that an admissible strategies may include no more than m different stocks concurrently, where m may be less than the total number n of available stocks. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to derive {{an understanding of the}} Act which is EMIR, and how it influences the OTC-derivative market. The goal is to address, if the regulative means of EMIR creates a change in the financial sector in Europe, and furthermore whether this change leads to economic stability within the Financial sector. Through a mix of statistics and qualitative methods the analysis has shown that EMIR and what it provides, have created a system of more transparency. The contribution of mandatory disclosure have brought confidence in the market of OTC-derivatives, where <b>portfolio</b> <b>compression</b> have reduced the notional amount of credit default swaps. CCP-clearing have shown to not only regulate the standardized OTC-derivatives, but also to be trendsetting for all OTC-derivatives including CDS...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} Massey's directed information in <b>portfolio</b> theory, data <b>compression,</b> and statistics with causality constraints. In particular, we show that directed information is an upper bound on the increment in growth rates of optimal portfolios in a stock market due to causal side information. This upper bound is tight for gambling in a horse race, which is an extreme case of stock markets. Directed information also characterizes the value of causal side information in instantaneous compression and quantifies the benefit of causal inference in joint compression of two stochastic processes. In hypothesis testing, directed information evaluates the best error exponent for testing whether a random process Y causally influences another process X or not. These results give a natural interpretation of directed information I(Y^n → X^n) {{as the amount of}} information that a random sequence Y^n = (Y_ 1,Y_ 2, [...] ., Y_n) causally provides about another random sequence X^n = (X_ 1,X_ 2, [...] .,X_n).

In particular, we show that directed information is an upper bound on the increment in growth rates of optimal portfolios in a stock market due to causal side information. This upper bound is tight for gambling in a horse race, which is an extreme case of stock markets. Directed information also characterizes the value of causal side information in instantaneous compression and quantifies the benefit of causal inference in joint compression of two stochastic processes. In hypothesis testing, directed information evaluates the best error exponent for testing whether a random process Y causally influences another process X or not. These results lead to a natural interpretation of directed information I(Y n! X n) {{as the amount of}} information that a random sequence Y n = (Y 1;Y 2; [...] .;Yn) causally provides about another random sequence X n = (X 1;X 2; [...] .;Xn). A new measure, directed lautum information, is also introduced and interpreted in <b>portfolio</b> theory, data <b>compression,</b> and hypothesis testing.
