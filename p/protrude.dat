5|$|Pugs' {{legs are}} strong, straight, of {{moderate}} length, and are set well under. Their shoulders are moderately laid back. Their ankles are strong, their feet are small, their toes are well split-up, and their nails are black. The lower teeth normally <b>protrude</b> further than their upper, {{resulting in an}} under-bite.|$|E
5|$|The darting can {{sometimes}} be so forceful that the dart ends up buried in the internal organs. It can also happen that a dart will pierce the body or head entirely, and <b>protrude</b> on the other side.|$|E
5|$|The extraocular {{muscles of}} the walrus are well-developed. This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to <b>protrude</b> its eyes and see in both a frontal and dorsal direction. However, vision in this species {{appears to be more}} suited for short-range.|$|E

5|$|File shells such as Limaria fragilis {{can produce}} a noxious {{secretion}} when stressed. It has numerous tentacles which fringe its mantle and <b>protrude</b> {{some distance from the}} shell when it is feeding. If attacked, it sheds tentacles in a process known as autotomy. The toxin released by this is distasteful and the detached tentacles continue to writhe which may also serve to distract potential predators.|$|E
5|$|Hummingbirds are {{significant}} pollinators of cacti. Species showing the typical hummingbird-pollination syndrome have flowers with colors towards the red {{end of the}} spectrum, anthers and stamens that <b>protrude</b> from the flower, and a shape that is not radially symmetrical, with a lower lip that bends downwards; they produce large amounts of nectar with a relatively low sugar content. Schlumbergera species, such as S. truncata, have flowers that correspond closely to this syndrome. Other hummingbird-pollinated genera include Cleistocactus and Disocactus.|$|E
5|$|Male {{and female}} guinea pigs {{do not differ}} in {{external}} appearance apart from general size. The position of the anus {{is very close to}} the genitals in both sexes. Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap, while the male genitals may look similar, with the penis and anus forming a like shape, the penis will <b>protrude</b> if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair. The male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling.|$|E

40|$|Management of <b>protruding</b> premaxilla is an {{important}} aspect of treatment of bilateral cleft lip. Surgical setback, which is considered as the last option in the management of grossly <b>protruded</b> premaxilla has {{an important}} role to play in selected cases. The present case had a grossly <b>protruded,</b> bulky premaxilla, which remained <b>protruded</b> even after 3 year following bilateral cleft lip repair. After failure to achieve expansion of maxillary arches by prosthodontic treatment for six month, patient was taken up for surgical setback. In view of the gross disparity between size of the <b>protruding</b> premaxilla and anterior gap between maxillary arches, conventional setback procedure {{would not have been possible}} and hence the patient underwent a bulk reduction procedure of premaxilla followed by the setback procedure. At the end of 6 weeks after surgery the premaxilla was stable...|$|R
5|$|The wool {{quality of}} a Herdwick has unique qualities {{relating}} to durability. Thick bristle type fibres will often <b>protrude</b> from garments forming a protective barrier layer in blizzards—most likely the same qualities that protect the sheep in similar conditions. They {{have been known to}} survive under a blanket of snow for three days while eating their own wool.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} recipe {{variations}} around the traditional ingredients, {{some of which}} include hard-boiled eggs, bacon, onion, mustard or white wine. Other alternatives to the main fish can be crayfish and rabbit or mutton. The stargazy pie is always topped with a pastry lid, generally shortcrust but sometimes puff pastry, through which the fish heads and sometimes tails <b>protrude.</b>|$|E
5|$|Underwire bras can rub and pinch the breast, causing skin {{irritation}} and breast pain, and the wire of a worn bra can <b>protrude</b> from the fabric and scrape or cut the skin. When {{the fabric of}} worn bra exposes an underwire, skin contact with nickel and other metals may cause contact dermatitis in a few women.|$|E

5|$|Although {{underlain}} by {{much older}} Triassic age formations that <b>protrude</b> to form what would {{once have been}} islands—such as Athelney, Brent Knoll, Burrow Mump and Glastonbury Tor, which is composed of Blue Lias, the lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000years, {{following the end of}} the last ice age. As the sea level changed following the Pliocene era, vegetation was laid down which was later converted into peat. The peak of the peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.|$|E

Glastonbury Tor is composed of Upper Lias Sand. The Poldens and the Isle of Wedmore are composed of Blue Lias and Marl, while the Mendips are largely Carboniferous limestone. Although sea level changes since the Pliocene led to changes in sea level and the laying down of vegetation, the peak of the peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.|$|E
5|$|Redback spider bites are {{difficult}} to diagnose in pets unless witnessed. Dogs appear to have some resistance. They are at serious risk only if bitten many times, and rarely need antivenom. Cats {{are likely to be}} more susceptible and require antivenom, which can reverse symptoms very quickly. Guinea pigs, horses and camels are very susceptible. As with humans, the symptoms are predominantly autonomic in nature alongside pain at the bite site. Dogs may also suffer vomiting and diarrhoea, muscle tremors or clonic contractions, and abdominal wall rigidity, while cats may salivate excessively, <b>protrude</b> their tongue or be overexcitable.|$|E
30|$|We {{should note}} that {{in the study area}} (5 [*]×[*] 5  μm 2, Fig.  4), the maximum {{diameter}} of <b>protruding</b> crystallites constitutes less than 450  nm and the maximum height of the <b>protruding</b> crystallites is 180  nm.|$|R
5000|$|As {{there are}} no {{diacritics}} in the IPA to distinguish <b>protruded</b> and compressed rounding, [...] (a mid front rounded vowel modified by endolabialization) will be used here as an ad hoc symbol for <b>protruded</b> mid front vowels.|$|R
30|$|We {{believe that}} the {{structure}} of our aluminum films can be conveniently described as {{a combination of a}} base film with a small size of grains and low roughness and large grains (crystallites), <b>protruding</b> above its surface. SEM images show that the grains of all films greatly vary in their sizes. Size and number of crystallites <b>protruding</b> above the surface increase with higher deposition rate of aluminum. <b>Protruding</b> grains have distinct faces.|$|R
5|$|The font design {{featured}} on the front cover was created by Pizz, a graphic artist from Long Beach, who also designed album cover art for several other indie rock bands. The {{back side of the}} album features a painting by bassist Emery, depicting a topless woman looking at herself through a hand mirror. On her chest is a red heart surrounded by arrows, and below, her ribs <b>protrude</b> from her sides, possibly a reference to anorexia and body image issues, a major theme of the album and its successor Live Through This.|$|E
5|$|The front {{landing gear}} is offset to the aircraft's right to allow {{placement}} of the 30mm cannon with its firing barrel along the centerline of the aircraft. During ground taxi, the offset front landing gear causes the A-10 to have dissimilar turning radii. Turning to the right on the ground takes less distance than turning left. The wheels of the main landing gear partially <b>protrude</b> from their nacelles when retracted, making gear-up belly landings easier to control and less damaging. All landing gears are hinged toward the aircraft's rear; if hydraulic power is lost, a combination of gravity and aerodynamic drag can open and lock the gear in place.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit that}} {{develops}} is a schizocarp {{consisting of two}} mericarps; each mericarp is a true seed. The paired mericarps are easily separated when they are dry. Premature separation (shattering) before harvest is undesirable because it can result in seed loss. Mature seeds are flattened on the commissural side that faced the septum of the ovary. The flattened side has five longitudinal ribs. The bristly hairs that <b>protrude</b> from some ribs are usually removed by abrasion during milling and cleaning. Seeds also contain oil ducts and canals. Seeds vary somewhat in size, ranging from less than 500 to more than 1000 seeds per gram.|$|E

5|$|The ovary and {{attached}} pistil <b>protrude</b> {{from the top}} of the floral tube near its opening, with the receptive stigma surface toward the front. Two 1 millimeter anthers hang from recurved, 2 millimeter filaments behind the pistil. Pollinators exiting after collecting nectar from the spur brush against the anther, transferring pollen to the stigma of the next flower they visit. The flowers can last up to 10 days but will wilt once they are pollinated. Pollinated ovaries ripen into 5millimeter (in.) dehiscent seed capsules containing numerous 1millimeter long seeds. The chromosome count for this species is 2n=44.|$|E
5|$|These {{muscles are}} {{involved}} in moving and manipulating the tongue. The left and right genioglossus muscles in particular are responsible for protruding the tongue. The muscles, attached to {{the underside of the}} top and back parts of the tongue, cause the tongue to <b>protrude</b> and deviate towards the opposite side. The hypoglossal nerve also supplies movements including clearing the mouth of saliva and other involuntary activities. The hypoglossal nucleus interacts with the reticular formation, involved in the control of several reflexive or automatic motions, and several corticonuclear originating fibers supply innervation aiding in unconscious movements relating to speech and articulation.|$|E
5|$|A termite nest can be {{considered}} as being composed of two parts, the inanimate and the animate. The animate is all of the termites living inside the colony, and the inanimate part is the structure itself, which is constructed by the termites. Nests can be broadly separated into three main categories: subterranean (completely below ground), epigeal (protruding above the soil surface), and arboreal (built above ground, but always connected to the ground via shelter tubes). Epigeal nests (mounds) <b>protrude</b> from the earth with ground contact and are made out of earth and mud. A nest has many functions such as providing a protected living space and providing shelter against predators. Most termites construct underground colonies rather than multifunctional nests and mounds. Primitive termites of today nest in wooden structures such as logs, stumps and the dead parts of trees, as did termites millions of years ago.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} fixation of a first movable component (4) of a micro-mechanical structural element to a stationary or moving second component (5) of the structural element, wherein a lateral surface of the first component and a lateral surface of the second component face one another. In the method, a layer (10) <b>protruding</b> from the lateral surface is produced on a side of one or both components (4, 5) adjoining the lateral surface. The movable first component is moved (4) for fixation against the second component (5) {{in such a manner}} that the <b>protruding</b> layer area slides {{over the side of the}} first or second component (4, 5) adjoining the lateral side or, in the case of a <b>protruding</b> layer (10) present on both components (4, 5), the <b>protruding</b> layer areas slide one over another such that, due to static friction, the <b>protruding</b> layer area (10) adheres to the component (4, 5) thereunder, or the <b>protruding</b> layer areas adhere to one another. With the proposed method it is possible to subsequently reduce gap widths between a movable structure element and a fixed or movable structure element with little effort...|$|R
40|$|<b>Protruding</b> ureterocele is a {{very rare}} case found in the literature. We are {{reporting}} a 21 year-old female with an intermittent <b>protruding</b> mass from urethra, accompanied by dysuria, hematuria, and recurrent urinary tract infection. Inspection of the external genitalia revealed a <b>protruding</b> mass from the urethra which could be reduced manually. Excretory urography showed bilateral single collecting systems, grade II hydronephrosis of the right kidney, and a cobra head appearance of the lower right pelvis. The patient {{was diagnosed with a}} <b>protruding</b> right ureterocele in a single collecting system, and thus, endoscopic incision of a ureterocele was performed. Ultrasonography which was carried out three weeks after the procedure confirmed no residual hydronephrosis or ureterocele in the bladder. Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) underwent at a three-month-follow up revealed a grade 5 vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) on the right side. Surgical reimplantation was then considered. In conclusion, endoscopic incision was safe and yielded good result for <b>protruding</b> ureteroceles, but the need for secondary surgery in several conditions should be considered...|$|R
