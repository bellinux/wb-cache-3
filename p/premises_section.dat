40|$|In this thesis, I {{attempt to}} analyze the {{possible}} causes for the optionality of Catalan participle agreement with preceding direct object third person clitic pronouns in the present perfective structure. I will present two hypotheses as to why this optionality occurs, namely language contact with Spanish as cause for this morpho syntactic change; and independent agreement loss over time, possibly across all Romance; and show why I believe the second to be the correct analysis. In section 1, I briefly describe how most Romance languages are grouped either as Type A, agreement rich; or Type B, agreement poor; and how Catalan seems to be somewhere in between. I then move on in section 2 to analyze data collected by native speakers in Igualada (2. 1), Barcelona (2. 2) and Valencia and the Balearic Islands (2. 3). In section 3 I then examine the hypothesis of Spanish influence on Catalan as the primary cause for optionality in this structure, as well as arguments against this hypothesis. In section 4 I use data from both Medieval Catalan and Old Spanish to uphold my hypothesis that this language change has occurred over time {{in both of these}} languages independent of syntactic influence from other languages. I further explore this <b>premise</b> in <b>section</b> 5, analyzing some possible causes for and patterns ofthis agreement loss, and in section 6 I focus on certain puzzling issues within the expected patterns. In section 7 I cite a personal communication that leads me to believe that independent agreement loss is slowly occurring across all Romance, even in French, an agreement-rich (Type A) language. I then draw some conclusions based on agreement losses in some different structures in Catalan and Spanish over time that suggest that agreement loss could be occurring very abundantly, across many different structures in many different Romance languages...|$|R
5000|$|Today {{thousands}} of South African learners continue to attend schools where inadequate infrastructure derails effective teaching and learning. The {{vast majority of}} schools still lack the resources that are taken for granted in wealthy suburbs. By late 2010, EE {{began to focus on}} a national struggle for minimum norms and standards for school infrastructure, realizing that, to achieve a wholesale nationwide improvement in school infrastructure - a challenge confronted in many of EE’s earlier campaigns - a strategic lever would be needed. This lever {{came in the form of}} minimum norms and standards for school infrastructure: the prospect of a law, to be created by the Minister as a set of regulations, <b>premised</b> on <b>Section</b> 5A of the amended South African Schools Act, to address the infrastructure requirements of every school in South Africa. As noted above, the idea of norms and standards for school infrastructure did not begin with EE; it was called for by Parliament itself in 2007, but this call had not been answered. Throughout 2009 and into 2010, the current Minister of Basic Education, Angelina ‘Angie’ Motshekga, promised to adopt and implement norms and standards within a projected timeframe on five separate occasions, either in an address to Parliament or in writing. On 11 June 2010, the National Policy for an Equitable Provision of an Enabling School Physical Teaching and Learning Environment (NPEP) was published. It strategically identified the development of norms and standards as a “first-priority” to be “developed and fully adopted by the end of the 2010/11 financial year” (i.e. by the end of March 2011). A month later, these intentions were reinforced by the Director General, Mr Bobby Soobrayan, when he wrote to EE to confirm that “the Minister must develop national minimum norms and standards [...] [...] [...] by the end of the 2010/2011 financial year”, and that the norms and standards “are currently with the DBE Legal Services and will be promulgated as regulations thereafter”.To help reinforce these commitments, on Human Rights Day in March 2011, 20,000 EE members and supporters marched to Parliament. In a memorandum handed over to the government, it was demanded that the Minister and the DBE keep their promise by adopting minimum norms and standards for school infrastructure before 1 April. This date then passed without the promulgation of the norms and standards. Learners responded by sending hundreds of letters expressing their frustrations to the Minister.Against this backdrop of broken promises, EE’s Campaign for Minimum Norms and Standards intensified. Over the months that followed, it gained momentum with marches, pickets, letters, vigils, camp-outs and door-to-door mobilizing. The Department, however, remained lukewarm and dismissive.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE. The {{objective}} {{of our study}} {{was to assess the}} effects of compressing source thin-section abdominal CT images on final transverse average-intensity-projection (AIP) images. MATERIALS AND METHODS. At reversible, 4 : 1, 6 : 1, 8 : 1, 10 : 1, and 15 : 1 Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) 2000 compressions, we compared the artifacts in 20 matching compressed thin sections (0. 67 mm), compressed thick sections (5 mm), and AIP images (5 mm) reformatted from the compressed thin sections. The artifacts were quantitatively measured with peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and a perceptual quality metric (High Dynamic Range Visual Difference Predictor [HDR-VDP]). By comparing the compressed and original images, three radiologists independently graded the artifacts as 0 (none, indistinguishable), 1 (barely perceptible), 2 (subtle), or 3 (significant). Friedman tests and exact tests for paired proportions were used. RESULTS. At irreversible compressions, the artifacts tended to increase in the order of AIP, thick-section, and thin-section images in terms of PSNR (p < 0. 0001), HDR-VDP (p < 0. 0001), and the readers' grading (p < 0. 01 at 6 : 1 or higher compressions). At 6 : 1 and 8 : 1, distinguishable pairs (grades 1 - 3) tended to increase in the order of AIP, thick-section, and thin-section images. Visually lossless threshold for the compression varied between images but decreased in the order of AIP, thick-section, and thin-section images (p < 0. 0001). CONCLUSION. Compression artifacts in thin sections are significantly attenuated in AIP images. On the <b>premise</b> that thin <b>sections</b> are typically reviewed using an AIP technique, it is justifiable to compress them to a compression level currently accepted for thick sections...|$|R

Another viral website, www.rocketpoppeteers.com, was also found, which like Slusho from Cloverfield plays no direct part in the film but is indirectly related. The official Super 8 website also contained an [...] "editing room" [...] section, which asked users to find various clips from around the web and piece them together. When completed, the reel makes up the film found by the kids in Dr. Woodward's trailer, showing the ship disintegrating into individual white cubes, and the alien reaching through the window of its cage and snatching Dr. Woodward. The video game Portal 2 contains an interactive trailer placing the player on board the train before it derails, and showing the carriage being smashed open and the roar of the alien within.|$|R
40|$|Nordic Light {{designs and}} {{manufactures}} lights to companies and retail shops {{all around the}} globe, {{and it is important}} to keep the right light to get the right impression for our vision. In a retail shop for sale of clothes, the energy consumption for lighting can lie around 70 % of the total. The lighting gives off almost as much heat as the power it uses, which means it is heating the shop and the shops around it. Very often an extra cooling system needs to be installed when only the ventilation cooling is not enough to keep the shop cool. If the power of the lighting is lowered, both energy and costs can be saved through reduced energy consumption for The lightingThe cooling of the shop with the extra cooling system and/or the ventilation systemBy examine a clothing shop nearby Stockholm, the need of cooling due to the heat input from the shop lighting could be studied. The shop was located in a shopping mall with adjoining shops and <b>premises.</b> The studied <b>sections</b> wereHeat transfer – transmission & infiltrationHeat input – lighting, heat of people, electronic equipment & solar radiationThe ventilation coolingThe extra cooling system – water-based cooling with chilled beams and a chillerThe current lighting, with 37 821 W of high intensity discharge lamps, was compared to other alternatives of lighting which wereLED – total power of 42 620 WHigh intensity discharge lamps – more in number but with a lower need of power with only 21 160 WWith LED it is possible to dim without having any negative changes in the light composition, therefor testes were made with percentage changes of the current lighting. The energy saving was examined according toPercentage reductions of the present lighting with an interval of 10 % from 90 % until 50 %An examination of the yearly energy consumption with percentage reductions. The energy consumption of the shop in 2013 was used for the calculationsThe examined shop paid only for the extra cooling from the chiller, which is why the savings considered in this report only applies for this one. The result of the calculations for the energy consumption showed thatLED – no savingHigh intensity discharge lamps (lower power) – 5, 07 kWh or 3, 84 W/m 2 Every percentage reduction of 10 % - 1, 39 kWh or 1, 05 W/m 2 Yearly saving of percentage reduction – 5000 kWh for each 10 % reductionThe yearly saving of the energy consumption of the extra cooling system and the lighting of the shop was calculated to be 18 000 kWh/år for every 10 % reduction. In the examined shop the most of the lighting was 35 W high intensity discharge lamps, and the considered LED lamps that have the matching light intensity need more energy to give off the same effect. That means that a direct change to LED would use more energy than the current lighting. Looking at LED lamps with a need of lower power the light intensity is much better than the high intensity discharge lamps. That means that the current lamps with 20 W could be changed into 15 W LED for energy saving. In this shop these lamps were so few that only a minimal change would be done. These values are not presented in the report. To make sure that no need of extra heating will emerge, no larger decrease than 20 % of the lighting should be done. It is needed to be considered that it might be worth to heat the shop during some times in the winter, because it might be cheaper than cooling the shop during the warmer months.
