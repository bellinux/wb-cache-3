25|$|<b>Pemphigus</b> is an {{uncommon}} autoimmune skin disease. The {{most common form}} in dogs is <b>pemphigus</b> foliaceus, which manifests as erosions and crusting of the skin and mucocutaneous junctions. <b>Pemphigus</b> vulgaris is more rare and manifests as blister-like lesions in the mouth and at mucocutaneous junctions. Bullous pemphigoid is most commonly seen in Dobermanns and Collies and appears as a scald-like lesion of the groin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pemphigus</b> foliaceus is an {{autoimmune}} skin disorder, {{believed to}} be genetic.|$|E
25|$|HLA DR4 is {{correlated}} with the genesis of rheumatoid arthritis, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, and <b>pemphigus</b> vulgaris.|$|E

25|$|Detection {{in other}} {{locations}} such as intercellular and areas below the epidermis (subepidermal), {{as well as}} along the dermoepidermal junction (area that joins the epidermis and dermis), suggests paraneoplastic <b>pemphigus.</b>|$|E
25|$|This field {{specializes in}} the {{treatment}} of immune-mediated skin diseases such as lupus, bullous pemphigoid, <b>pemphigus</b> vulgaris, and other immune-mediated skin disorders. Specialists in this field often run their own immunopathology labs.|$|E
25|$|Some of the viral infections {{mentioned}} above are also classified as vesiculobullous diseases. Other example vesiculobullous diseases include <b>pemphigus</b> vulgaris, mucous membrane pemphigoid, bullous pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, linear IgA disease, and epidermolysis bullosa.|$|E
25|$|PNP is most {{commonly}} mistaken for <b>pemphigus</b> vulgaris, {{due to the}} extreme similarities of the lesions that develop. However, the difference lies in the specificity of the autoreactive antibodies in each case.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pemphigus</b> betae, {{also known}} as the {{sugarbeet}} root aphid, is a species of gall-forming aphid that forms galls specifically on the commonly found Narrowleaf Cottonwood (aka the Willow-leaved Poplar tree), Populus angustifolia.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, a {{case study}} of a woman with ulcers {{on the back of her}} leg {{reported}} as being diagnosed with PNP. The underlying tumors are almost exclusively of B-cell lineage. However, T-cells and CD56+ Natural Killer cells have also been postulated to be associated effectors of paraneoplastic <b>pemphigus.</b> This case demonstrated the rare association between Natural Killer cell lymphoma and PNP, suggesting that Natural Killer cells could be involved in the pathogenesis of PNP. The article warned clinicians to be alert to the possibility that paraneoplastic <b>pemphigus</b> in lymphomas not of B-cell lineage. This added to the already complex, not fully understood pathogenesis of PNP.|$|E
25|$|The {{skin and}} the lens have the same embryological origin and so can be {{affected}} by similar diseases. Those with atopic dermatitis and eczema occasionally develop shield ulcers cataracts. Ichthyosis is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with cuneiform cataracts and nuclear sclerosis. Basal-cell nevus and <b>pemphigus</b> have similar associations.|$|E
25|$|Other {{examples}} of insect parthenogenesis {{can be found}} in gall-forming aphids (e.g., <b>Pemphigus</b> betae), where females reproduce parthenogenetically during the gall-forming phase of their life cycle and in grass thrips. In the grass thrips genus Aptinothrips there have been, despite the very limited number of species in the genus, several transitions to asexuality.|$|E
25|$|While leading Blondie, Harry and Stein became {{partners}} in {{life as well}} as musically. In the mid 1980s, she took a few years off to care for Stein while he suffered with <b>pemphigus,</b> a rare autoimmune disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes. Stein and Harry broke up in the 1980s but continued to work together.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} if the patient is afflicted with paraneoplastic <b>pemphigus,</b> several tests may be performed. Initially, samples are obtained via skin biopsy for routine microscopy and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) testing. The skin sample should be obtained from an unaffected area adjacent to a lesion. Testing in more detail follows depending on the results from the DIF. Prompt diagnosis of PNP is crucial due to the high mortality rate of the disease.|$|E
25|$|Azathioprine is used {{alone or}} in {{combination}} with other immunosuppressive therapy to prevent rejection following organ transplantation, and to treat an array of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, <b>pemphigus,</b> systemic lupus erythematosus, Behçet's disease, and other forms of vasculitis, autoimmune hepatitis, atopic dermatitis, myasthenia gravis, neuromyelitis optica (Devic's disease), restrictive lung disease, and others. It is also an important therapy and steroid-sparing agent for inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and for multiple sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|After {{a year-long}} hiatus in 1981 during which Harry {{released}} her first solo album (see below), Blondie regrouped and released their sixth studio album, The Hunter, in 1982. The album {{was not as}} successful as their previous works, and a world tour was cut short owing to slow ticket sales. It was around this time that Stein also fell seriously ill with the rare autoimmune disease <b>pemphigus.</b> His illness, along with declining record sales and internal struggles, led the band to split up.|$|E
25|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20th century new {{innovations}} in the art of classical dance began to become apparent. With all of this, Petipa's rocky relationship with the new director of the Imperial Theatres, Vladimir Telyakovsky, appointed to the position in 1901, served as a catalyst to the Ballet Master's end. Telyakovsky made no effort in disguising his dislike of Petipa's work, as he felt that the art of classical ballet had become stagnant under him, and felt that other choreographers should have a chance {{at the helm of the}} Imperial Ballet. But even at the age of eighty-three, and suffering from the constant pain brought on by a severe case of the skin disease <b>pemphigus,</b> the old Maestro showed no signs of slowing down, much to Telyakovsky's chagrin.|$|E
25|$|Sugarbeet root aphids {{are closely}} {{synchronized}} with their hosts Populus augustifolia, {{with the majority}} of stem mothers colonizing leaves within three days after the leaf buds burst. There is intense competition between <b>Pemphigus</b> stem mothers over leaf choice - galls formed on larger leaves have higher stem mother weight, more aphids overall, and a lower probability of being aborted. Moreover, galls formed closer to the leaf stem-and thus closer to the source of nutrients flowing into the leaf-also benefit in the same way. During the aphids' emergence in the spring, large Populus leaves are colonized first. Once a stem mother forms a gall, she is more reluctant to move to a new leaf even if the current one withers, though the ability to colonize a large, healthy leaf close to its stem is crucial in ensuring an aphid's reproductive success.|$|E

500|$|Bruegel {{painted with}} the {{empirical}} objectivity of the Renaissance. [...] In earlier paintings the blind were typically depicted with eyes closed. Here, Bruegel gives each man a different ocular affliction, all painted with a realism that allowed identification of their conditions by later experts, {{though there is}} still some diagnostic disagreement. [...] French anatomical pathologist Jean-Martin Charcot and anatomical artist Paul Richer published an early account, [...] ("The deformed and sick in art", 1889), and French pathologist Tony-Michel Torrillhon followed with more research on Bruegel's figures in 1957. [...] The first man's eyes are not visible; the second has had his eyes removed, along with the eyelids: the third suffers from corneal leukoma; the fourth atrophy of the globe; the fifth is either blind with no light perception, or photophobic; and the sixth has <b>pemphigus</b> or bullous pemphigoid. [...] Charcot and Richer noted Bruegel's accuracy in portraying the blind men facing not forward but with their faces raised in the air, as {{they would have had to}} rely on their senses of smell and hearing.|$|E

2500|$|Petipa was {{diagnosed}} with a severe case of the skin disease <b>pemphigus</b> in 1892. The constant pain and itching brought on by this disease caused Petipa to refrain from choreography for the Imperial Ballet's entire 1892–1893 theatrical season. It has been widely accepted by history that the responsibility of staging Tchaikovsky's second work for the Imperial Ballet The Nutcracker, fell to the Imperial Theatre's second Ballet Master Lev Ivanov. With regard to who was ultimately responsible for the choreography for The Nutcracker, many sources contradict one another. Some claim either that Petipa was responsible for staging the entire ballet or that he merely supervised Ivanov's progress. The Nutcracker premiered [...] on a double bill with Tchaikovsky's opera Iolanta at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre. Many critics of the day considered the work to not even be a ballet at all, with far too much emphasis on spectacle rather than drama, something made all the more unsuccessful since the ballerina's role was reduced to a mere Grand Pas de deux in the final scene. The critics also complained that Ivanov's choreography was banal, with only a few passages succeeding simply because Ivanov imitated the choreography of Petipa's dances from other works. One such passage mentioned in reviews was the Valse des flocons de neige (Waltz of the Snowflakes), which was said to be almost identical to a waltz from Petipa's 1879 ballet La Fille des Neiges (The Daughter of the Snows).|$|E
