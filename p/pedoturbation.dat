40|$|The fall {{of a tree}} {{accompanied}} by its uprooting {{is the most common}} natural end of the tree life. To understand how soil is affected by treefalls, it is necessary to recognize their signs in soil profiles, even when their surface features (pit-and-mound topography) are erased. The paper reviews these signs of treefalls in soil profiles, which can be used to distinguish the patterns of old treefall-related <b>pedoturbations.</b> The paper is based on a literature analysis and results of authors’ long-term studies of forest soil in the European part of Russia and in the Western Siberia. Two main types of uprooting of a falling tree (hinge and rotational treefalls) are considered. The paper presents data on the sizes of 424 pit-and-mound soil complexes for nine tree species (Tilia cordata, Acer platanoides, Fraxinus excelsior, Ulmus glabra, Quercus robur, Betula pendula, Populus tremula, Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris) and describes peculiarities of soil relocation in the process of different treefalls, which is necessary to recognize old treefall complexes in soil profiles. The following soil-profile signs of treefalls are considered: (1) treefall pits (cauldrons); (2) spotty or streaky structures of different degrees of contrast; (3) blocks of “buried material” from the upper soil layers; (4) washed (bleached) material depositing at the bottom of pits and filling soil pores and channels of various origins; (5) signs of hydrogenous changes of soil material resulting from water stagnation in the pits; (6) root channels {{at the bottom of the}} pit and (7) inclusions of litter and charcoal. As shown by our studies, treefall-related <b>pedoturbations</b> affect soil profiles at a depth larger than the depth usually described by the soil horizons A, E, Bhs, etc. A conclusion is made that in most forest soils, the middle and lower parts of profiles have patterns originating from the transfer of soil material upon treefalls...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFabric {{analysis}} in archaeological contexts, i. e. {{the study of}} the orientation and dip of artefacts, has been significantly improved during the last decade, mainly with respect to the statistical treatment of data, the development of a reference base for natural sedimentary processes as well as the increased number of data for Palaeolithic levels. These works show that fabrics are an efficient tool for assessing site formation processes. Fabrics allow discrimination between (i) undisturbed (or minimally disturbed) levels, (ii) levels that have undergone strong <b>pedoturbations</b> due to biological activity or to shrinking and swelling of clayey sediments and (iii) levels that have been significantly reworked by slope processes such as periglacial solifluction or overland flow. However, in the present state of knowledge, fabrics do not allow precise estimation of the degree of perturbation if not associated with other archaeological and geological criteria. From the set of data on French Palaeolithic sites used here, it is demonstrated that slope dynamics and particularly solifluction for sites predating the Late Glacial may have {{played an important role in}} site formation...|$|R
50|$|The main {{processes}} of soil formation of oxisols are weathering, humification and <b>pedoturbation</b> due to animals. These processes produce the characteristic soil profile. They {{are defined as}} soils containing at all depths no more than 10 percent weatherable minerals, and low cation exchange capacity. Oxisols are always a red or yellowish color, due to the high concentration of iron(III) and aluminium oxides and hydroxides. In addition they also contain quartz and kaolin, plus small amounts of other clay minerals and organic matter.|$|E
50|$|Mollisols are a soil {{order in}} USDA soil taxonomy. Mollisols form in {{semi-arid}} to semi-humid areas, typically under a grassland cover. They are most {{commonly found in}} the mid-latitudes, namely in North America, mostly east of the Rocky Mountains, in South America in Argentina (Pampas) and Brazil, and in Asia in Mongolia and the Russian Steppes. Their parent material is typically base-rich and calcareous and include limestone, loess, or wind-blown sand. The main processes {{that lead to the}} formation of grassland Mollisols are melanisation, decomposition, humification and <b>pedoturbation.</b>|$|E
50|$|In general, {{the mixing}} of the soil by the {{activities}} of animals, sometimes called <b>pedoturbation,</b> tends to undo or counteract the tendency of other soil-forming processes that create distinct horizons. Termites and ants may also retard soil profile development by denuding large areas of soil around their nests, leading to increased loss of soil by erosion. Large animals such as gophers, moles, and prairie dogs bore into the lower soil horizons, bringing materials to the surface. Their tunnels are often open to the surface, encouraging the movement of water and air into the subsurface layers. In localized areas, they enhance mixing of the lower and upper horizons by creating, and later refilling, underground tunnels. Old animal burrows in the lower horizons often become filled with soil material from the overlying A horizon, creating profile features known as crotovinas.|$|E
5000|$|Mollisols {{occur in}} savannahs and {{mountain}} valleys (such as Central Asia, or the North American Great Plains). These environments {{have historically been}} strongly influenced by fire and abundant <b>pedoturbation</b> from organisms such as ants and earth worms. It was estimated that in 2003, only 14 to 26 percent of grassland ecosystems still remained in a relatively natural state (that is, they were not used for agriculture due to the fertility of the A horizon). Globally, they represent ~7% of ice-free land area. As the world's most agriculturally productive soil order, the Mollisols represent {{one of the more}} economically important soil orders. [...] Though most of the other soil orders known today existed {{by the time of the}} Carboniferous Ice Age 280 million years ago, Mollisols are not known from the paleopedological record any earlier than the Eocene. Their development is very closely associated with the cooling and drying of the global climate that occurred during the Oligocene, Miocene and Pliocene.|$|E

40|$|Much {{effort has}} been {{focussed}} on understanding the luminescence properties of natural minerals to achieve a reliable, accurate and precise dating technique. However, some field related aspects, such as the influence or effect of post-depositional disturbance on luminescence dates, are as yet underexplored. In the case of <b>pedoturbation,</b> depending on its intensity, the rate of sedimentation and unit thicknesses, potentially the whole sedimentary record at a site can be affected. This may lead to distorted OSL chronologies and erroneous sediment burial ages. <b>Pedoturbation</b> can result in sediment mixing and/or exhumation that affect luminescence both at the bulk and single grain level. Effects of these two principle processes on luminescence ages are examined using standard multigrain and single grain protocols. High resolution sampling of surface gopher mounds {{was used to determine}} the efficiency of bio-exhumation in resetting luminescence signal. Results show this is an inefficient mechanism for onsite sediment bleaching. The effects on luminescence signal of bio-mixing were explored by comparing a sample collected from within a krotovina (infilled burrow) to an adjacent undisturbed sample. Results show the difficulties in identifying pedoturbated samples at the single aliquot level and the possible inaccuracies in using the lowest palaeodose values to calculate OSL ages. Where <b>pedoturbation</b> of samples is suspected, use of probability plots of palaeodoses data is recommended. From these plots it is proposed that only data falling within a normal distribution centred on the peak probability be used to calculated OSL ages and to mitigate problems arising from <b>pedoturbation.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The {{optically}} stimulated luminescence (OSL) {{signal from}} quartz grains is most often used to estimate the depositional age of sediments that were fully bleached during transport and have not been mixed after deposition. However, sediment that is transported fluvially {{may not have been}} exposed to sufficient sunlight to bleach the latent OSL signal, while stable land surfaces on which soils are developing will likely be subject to mixing processes such as <b>pedoturbation.</b> In these cases, large equivalent dose (D e) datasets derived from individual sand-sized quartz grains can shed light on the depositional and post-depositional histories of sedimentary deposits. Here, we report the results of geochronological investigations of Mt Chambers Creek alluvial fan, on the eastern footslopes of the Flinders Ranges, South Australia. We collected 13 OSL samples from bank exposures and pits excavated into relict floodouts to reconstruct late Quaternary alluvial dynamics. Single-grain D e datasets yielded overdispersion-values of between 26 and 68 %. Most of these values are significantly higher than the overdispersion values obtained during dose-recovery experiments, suggesting that many deposits were poorly bleached, mixed, and/or experienced significant dose rate heterogeneity. Single-grain measurements of a sample from the modern floodout demonstrate that partial bleaching is minor and cannot explain the D e distributions for Holocene and Pleistocene samples. The results of systematic application of the finite mixture model (FMM) to all D e datasets in conjunction with contextual observations suggest that post-depositional mixing by <b>pedoturbation</b> has significantly affected the deposits and observed OSL data. For most samples, we infer that the most populous FMM component represents deposition and that secondary components represent intrusive younger grains or partially bleached older grains. The fan-wide presence of contemporaneous intrusive grain-populations suggests that post-depositional mixing occurred in phases, possibly associated with intervals of increased <b>pedoturbation...</b>|$|E

40|$|In alpine environments, {{colonies of}} snow vole (Chionomys nivalis Martins) cause strong <b>pedoturbation,</b> which may affect {{humification}} process and {{soil organic matter}} (SOM) cycling, with repercussions on the hormone-like activity of organics. We investigated the effect of snow vole <b>pedoturbation</b> on the chemical and spectroscopic features of soil organic fractions, and the potential hormone-like activity of humic and fulvic acids (HA, FA). The study site was located on the high-mountain environment of the Majella massif (central Italy). Pedoturbated and regular soils were morphologically described and characterized for pH and content of total organic carbon, total extractable carbon, HA, and FA. Both HA and FA were extracted and investigated using attenuated total reflectance/Fourier transform infrared (ATR/FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance with high-resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS-NMR), and H- 1 -C- 13 heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC). HA and FA were also tested for their auxin-like and gibberellin-like activities. Results provide evidences that bioturbated and regular soils contain a poorly decomposed SOM, but HA and FA with a well-defined molecular structure. The HA and FA from both bioturbated and regular soils show a hormone-like activity with a different allocation along the soil profile. In the regular soil, the highest auxin-like activity was shown by HA and FA from Oe 1 horizon, while gibberellin-like activity was expressed by FA from Oe 2 horizon. Burrowing activity determines a redistribution of organics throughout the profile with a relatively high auxin-like activity in the FA from straw tunnel wall (STW) and gibberellin-like activity in the HA from vole feces (VF). The relative high presence of carboxylic acids, amides, proteins, and amino acids in the FA from STW and the aromatic moieties in the HA from VF put evidences for their different behavior. The fact that snow vole activity has modified the chemical and biological properties of SOM in these soils otherwise considered governed only by low temperature has important ecological implications such as the preservation of soil fertility and vegetal biodiversity...|$|E

The model includes a depth-dependent decrease in root C input and decomposition rate, and vertical soil movement due to <b>pedoturbation</b> and leaching. The calibration of this model was done based on experimental data of carbon isotopes (12 C, 13 C, and 14 C) from profiles in Iowa and mineral radionuclides (137 Cs and excess 210 Pb) from the U. K.

Nevertheless, several generally assumed concepts needed to be rejected to have a functional depth-explicit model. First, adding vertical soil transport (calibrated by the mineral isotope profiles) to the existing CENTURY caused a complete disappearance of the passive C pool. The latter could only be resolved by assuming a decrease in transport rates with depth and a 10 -times smaller rate constant for microbial decomposition than the rate constant assumed in CENTURY...|$|E

The parent materials of the clay soils which cover almost this entire area belong to two broad groups: alluvial, deltaic and paludal sediments from rivers {{belonging to the}} Nile system (aggradational clay plains), and colluvio-alluvial deposits derived from local rock weathering, pediplanation and short-distance transport (degradational clay plains). The soils are classified as Vertisols in three international systems. Relationships between soil parent material, landform, climate, vegetation and soils were defined in the field. Field studies were supported by an analysis of mineralogical, chemical and physical soil data. The various landscapes that together make the Central Clay Plain were delineated on a 1 : 2 000 000 pedogeomorphic map. Hypotheses on the sedimentation history of the aggradational plains were tested against data on geology, palaeoclimatology and palaeobotany in the literature.

This sreseach was aimed to: (1) study the soil development of rainfed paddy soils derived from lacustrine and (2) evaluate rainfed paddy soils potency for paddy and corn in Paguyaman. Soil samples were taken from three profiles according to toposequent, and they were analyzed in laboratory. Data were analyzed with descriptive-quantitative analysis. Furthermore, assessment on rainfed paddy soils potency was conducted with land suitability analysis using parametric approach. Results indicate that all pedon had evolved with B horizons structurization.

The main pedogenesis in all pedons were through elluviation, illuviation, lessivage, <b>pedoturbation,</b> and gleization processes.

Here, we present {{the results of an}} investigation into the use of single-grain optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating to derive rates of soil mixing in the top 50 cm of soil profiles from two toposequences situated in the Werrikimbe National Park in Australia. Of 500 single grains analysed from each sampled depth increment, less than 25 % provided a finite age, {{with the rest of the}} grains either non-responsive or dose-saturated. This proportion of finite-age grains tended to decrease with soil depth. Median ages of quartz grains increased down the soil profile, with topsoil ages of up to 500 years and subsoil ages of up to 5000 years. Few 'younger' grains were found deeper in the profile and few 'older' grains near the soil surface. These trends suggest that <b>pedoturbation</b> is resulting in vertical transport of grains through the profile, but that there is a distribution of transport distances, with a poor probability of large transport distances from surface to subsoil or vice versa compared with a more frequent movement of grains to and from the surface in the uppermost 10 - 35 cm. The calculation of a single age for each soil horizon was unachievable as each horizon contained a heterogeneous mixture of grains with varying histories of transport to and from the soil surface. Soil mixing was confirmed along both toposequences studied. However, the occurrence of minor mixing rates did not lead to a homogenization of the topsoil and adjacent horizons. We postulated that mixing velocities were mostly related to flora at our study site.

The study showed that the main pedogenic processes were braunification, mineralization and lessivation. Floral <b>pedoturbation</b> encouraged illuviation, thus resulting into the formation of clay films on ped surfaces and Bt horizons. The soils were reddish brown to dark reddish brown with hues between 2. 5 to 5 YR and chroma less than 4. The texture varied from gravelly clay loam to gravelly clay, the structure ranged from weak fine to moderate subangular blocky and non sticky to sticky consistence with aging plantations. The soil pH slightly varied between 5. 6 and 6. 3 with plantation age and soil depth. Organic C content did not reveal a definite trend with plantation age, though values were lower in subsurface horizons and decreased with depth. Available P and Total Exchangeable Bases (TEB) linearly decreased with aging plantations. The lowest TEB value (8. 52 cmol(+) /kg) was obtained under the oldest tree stands. The exchange acidity (Al and H) value was highest (2. 40 cmol(+) /kg) in the underlying horizons under the oldest plantation, thus indicative of the deteriorative effects of trees on the soil properties.

Bioturbation and colluvial soil re-location {{are important and}} significant processes that affect the mechanisms and rate of bedrock weathering. The estimation of the relative fraction of bedrock grains which has been mixed in the soil and transported either vertically or laterally to different depths gives {{an indication of the}} degree to which bedrock weathering is controlled by the latter processes. However, despite the great effort dedicated to the analysis of these processes, little is known about the quantitative relationship between geomorphological changes and soil formation, especially for long timescales. This study presents reconstruction of soil processes by single grain optically stimulated luminescence techniques (OSL) in several profiles sampled along a hillslope. The OSL analyses provide a direct measurement of soil forming processes (e. g. bioturbation, colluviation) and with them a more precise formulation of soil formation models at longer timescales. Single-grain OSL techniques have been applied to quartz and feldspar minerals which were extracted from different soil horizons from a hillslope catena located in Sierra Morena, Córdoba, in the south of Spain. Four profiles were explored extracting twelve samples in order to study vertical and lateral mixing (e. g. soil creep, colluvial processes) of soils. The suitability of three different OSL single grain approaches, quartz OSL, IRSL (infrared stimulated luminescence) and pIRIR (post-IRSL) feldspar, was tested on four samples. From this analysis parameters from single-grain OSL age distributions (e. g. number of zeroed grains, scatter and shape of the distribution) were deduced to be used as indicators for bioturbation and/or soil-relocation. The most suitable approach was the applied to the several samples from hillslope catena.

Chipped stone material diagnostic of the Clovis period was recovered during the TAMU block excavation, informally referred to as the "Lindsey Pit," from clay deposits approximately 35 cm thick. Natural agents that may have impacted contextual integrity of the Clovis cultural deposits include stream action, <b>pedoturbation,</b> and bioturbation. Artifact spatial analyses examined long axis orientations and artifact degree of dip to identify non-random patterns that would result from stream action. Vertical and horizontal relationships of refitting artifacts were examined to evaluate post-depositional displacement. Orientations of chipped stone artifact long axes and inclination were found to be statistically random, with minor patterns that reflect the paleotopography. Thirty-three groups of refitting artifacts were identified, none of which contained elements recovered from deposits more recent than the Clovis clays. Five groups have elements that appear to come from both of the Clovis clay deposits, indicating a small degree of vertical displacement. The results of this research indicate the clays bearing Clovis materials retained a high degree of integrity such that the spatial patterns preserved in the archaeological record at this location are the result of cultural activities and not natural processes.

40|$|The {{canopy of}} many central African forests is {{dominated}} by light-demanding tree species that do not regenerate well under themselves. The prevalence of these species might result from ancient slash-and-burn agricultural activities that created large openings, while a decline of these activities since the colonial period could explain their deficit of regeneration. To verify this hypothesis, we compared soil charcoal abundance, used {{as a proxy for}} past slash-and-burn agriculture, and tree species composition assessed on 208 rainforest 0. 2 ha plots located in three areas from Southern Cameroon. Species were classified in regeneration guilds (pioneer, non-pioneer light-demanding, shade-bearer) and characterized by their wood-specific gravity, assumed to reflect light requirement. We tested the correlation between soil charcoal abundance and: (i) the relative abundance of each guild, (ii) each species and family abundance and (iii) mean wood-specific gravity. Charcoal was found in 83 % of the plots, indicating frequent past forest fires. Radiocarbon dating revealed two periods of fires: "recent" charcoal were on average 300 years old (up to 860 BP, n =  16) and occurred in the uppermost 20 cm soil layer, while "ancient" charcoal were on average 1900 years old (range: 1500 to 2800 BP, n =  43, excluding one sample dated 9400 BP), and found in all soil layers. While we expected a positive correlation between the relative abundance of light-demanding species and charcoal abundance in the upper soil layer, overall {{there was no evidence that}} the current heterogeneity in tree species composition can be explained by charcoal abundance in any soil layer. The absence of signal supporting our hypothesis might result from (i) a relatively uniform impact of past slash-and-burn activities, (ii) <b>pedoturbation</b> processes bringing ancient charcoal to the upper soil layer, blurring the signal of centuries-old Human disturbances, or (iii) the prevalence of other environmental factors on species composition...|$|E

The materials underlying the pre-Wisconsin paleosols on the terraces indicated occurrence of three distinct deposits, suggesting some major hiatus in the depositional environments of the old valley. The colluvial-alluvial, till-derived sediment, clay sediment, and a sandy sediment composed the depositional units of the terraces. The whole sequence was underlain by Pennsylvanian shale bedrock. The macromorphology, clay mineralogy, elemental analysis, pedogenic free oxides, total-P, total-Ti, and pH suggested a catenary soil-landscape relationship. The clay mineralogy of YS and LS paleosols showed smectites, vermiculites, kaolinites, micas, Fe oxides were dominant with most variation in vermiculites, micas, and Fe oxides. A relatively intensive weathering occurred in the YS solum. Diagenesis due to influxes from the overlying loess confound pedogenic processes. The LS paleosols were moderately weathered as evidenced by the extractable free oxides of Al, Fe, and Mn and their relationships with total elements. The higher concentration of pedogenic free oxides in the footslope of the upland indicated movement of the sesquioxides by pedogenic and geomorphic processes occurred in this catenary system. The macromorphology and Mn[subscript] d/Fe[subscript] d indicated a high water table in the YS solum in YS time. The pedogenic regimes of the YS and LS paleosols were influenced by a high water table and significant influxes from the overlying Wisconsin loess...|$|E
40|$|Vertisols are clayey soils {{containing}} slickensides and wedge-shaped aggregates {{formed by}} shrink-swell processes in seasonally wet climates. The dynamic distribution of macro- and microvoids as {{a by-product of}} this unique <b>pedoturbation</b> process, accompanied by microtopographic lows and highs (gilgai), mitigate our ability to make accurate and precise interpretations of aquic and hydric conditions in these problem soils. We studied Vertisols across a subhumid to humid climosequence to assess the formation of redoximorphic features on shallow, linear (nondepressional) landscape positions in response to varying levels of rainfall. Approximately 1000 mm of mean annual precipitation (MAP) is required to form soft iron masses that then increase in abundance, and to shallower depths, with increasing rainfall. Soft iron masses with diffuse boundaries become more abundant with higher rainfall in microlows, whereas masses with nondiffuse boundaries become more common in microhighs. Most soft iron masses form in oxygenated ped interiors as water first saturates and then reduces void walls where iron depletions form. In contrast, at least 1276 mm of MAP is needed to form iron pore linings in both microlow and microhigh topographic positions. Iron depletions do not correlate with rainfall in terms of abundance or depth of occurrence. The quantity of crayfish burrows co-varies with rainfall and first appears coincidentally with soft iron masses in microlows near 1000 mm of MAP; they do not appear until nearly 1400 mm of MAP in microhighs. Dithionite-citrate extractable and ammonium-oxalate extractable iron oxides increase systematically with rainfall indicating more frequent episodes of iron reduction and precipitation into pedogenic segregations. The sum of our data suggests that Vertisols forming in the Coast Prairie of Texas with MAP greater than 1276 mm should be classified as aquerts {{because of the presence}} of aquic conditions. These same soils may also meet the definition of hydric as one criterion for the identification of Federally-protected wetlands. However, there is a considerable disjunct between protracted periods of saturation and limited periods of reduction in these soils. Based on the distribution of redoximorphic features in the study area, regional water table data, and recent electrical resistivity data from a nearby upland Vertisol, non-Darcian bypass flow is the principle mechanism governing the flux of water through deep cracks where water first accumulates and then persists in microlow bowls at depths of 1 to 2 m...|$|E
30|$|A {{variety of}} natural organic matters (NOM) (wood, kerogen, bitumen, and whole sediments) were {{subjected}} to both Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) and NMR techniques [24]. Interestingly, this work showed that HRMAS applied to the whole NOM samples was superior to the traditional liquid-state NMR measurements of extracts from the same NOM materials [24]. Another study combined HRMAS and DRIFT (Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy) techniques to identify {{the relationship between the}} structure of soil humic substances and long-term (40  years) soil management practices, including organic and/or mineral fertilizations [25]. The application of T 2 -based (namely CPMG or spin-echo) NMR filters to reduce signals heterogeneity in 1 H spectra of humic substances allowed to develop cluster analyses to differentiate humic matter as a function of soil treatments [25]. In the same line, conventional and diffusion-edited HRMAS proton spectra were applied to evaluate the long-term stabilization mechanisms of organic materials in soils undergone solid cattle manure and crop residues amendments and fractionated into free, intra-macroaggregate, intra-microaggregate, mineral-associated, and dissolved organic matter [26]. The authors compared the peaks detected in 1 D HRMAS spectra of HF-treated soil with those of a bovine albumin protein and cultured soil microbes and suggested that the material associated with the clay mostly resembles the molecular components derived from microbial biomass [26]. Such finding was accompanied by a further study in which diffusion-edited HRMAS NMR spectra of HF-treated soil aggregates of different dimensions were related to the role of microbes in conservation tillage systems [27]. A tight relationship between soil hydrophobicity and humic composition was revealed by relating HRMAS spectra of soil humic fractions and physical parameters such as soil wettability, pore size distribution, and soil aggregate stability [28]. These results confirmed previous works that the hydrophobicity of humic fractions can affect aggregate wetting and slaking by modifying the pore size distribution with a shift from micro- and mesopores to ultramicropores. The HRMAS technique was also applied to monitor the modifications of both chemical and biological properties of SOM upon the strong <b>pedoturbation</b> caused by colonies of snow vole (Chionomys nivalis Martins) in a mountain environment [29]. The authors reported that snow vole activity was capable to significantly affect the humification process and SOM cycling, with effects on the hormone-like bioactivity of humic fractions.|$|E
40|$|International audienceLaterites are {{oxidized}} Fe-rich soils covering {{one third}} of the continents and are drained by half of the continental waters. They therefore represent a key component of the iron geochemical cycle at the Earth's surface, yet no iron isotope study has been conducted on recent laterites so far. Building on previous integrated morpho-pedological studies of soils located in an equatorial rainforest, Southern Cameroon, we have undertaken a mineralogical, elemental and isotopic study of iron in two lateritic profiles. One is a borehole 3620 cm deep going to the parent granodioritic rock, located {{at the top of a}} hill, whereas the other is 675 cm deep and is located downhill. Mossbauer spectroscopy reveals that typically >= 96 % of the soil's iron is held in nanocrystalline hematite and goethite. Iron isotope measurements performed by plasma source mass spectrometry show that Fe isotopic equilibrium was rarely reached between these iron oxide and hydroxide despite their small size. Overall, it is found that most samples display iron isotope signatures very close to the mean crustal value, with a maximum range of 0. 2 parts per thousand in delta Fe- 57. Given that lateritic soils evolve over millions of years, show large variations in Fe concentrations and mineralogical abundances, this range is surprisingly small when compared to other Fe isotope studies of soils from different climatological contexts, that can easily show delta Fe- 57 ranges in excess of 1 parts per thousand. at the bulk sample scale. The most likely explanation of this finding is that despite notable vertical and lateral Fe mobility in the studied laterites from Cameroon, as computed using the open-system mass fraction transport function, tau(Fe,w), iron remained mostly in the oxidized form as shown by Mossbauer spectroscopy. This probably results from the strong bioturbation and <b>pedoturbation</b> of these lateritic soils that lead them to remain porous over a large thickness and facilitated the flow of oxygenated waters from the surface down to the saprolite horizon. This study therefore reveals that soils that remained as an open system for iron do not necessarily show large Fe isotopic variations. It is suggested that the Fe drained from such lateritic soils should have delta Fe- 57 values within similar to 0. 1 parts per thousand. of that of the continental crust. This is in contrast with previous soil studies, notably from sites located at higher latitudes, that imply that these soils should release isotopically more variable Fe to surface waters. Such possible contrasted isotopic signatures from different surface waters will likely lead to an isotopically heterogeneous ocean given the short residence time of Fe in seawater...|$|E
