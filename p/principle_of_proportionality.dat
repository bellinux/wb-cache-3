The Commission's resulting March 2009 report criticised the Georgian law. The law was at odds with UN Security Council resolutions that were binding both on the Russian Federation and on Georgia. The report said that the law raised concerns [...] "with regard to humanitarian access to the conflict affected areas." [...] The terms used in Article 2 contradicted 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Limitation on free migration [...] "may be in contradiction with the Georgian international engagements." [...] The Commission also stressed Georgia's obligation to respect the 1951 Refugee Convention. The commission also criticised the law's lack of clarity, saying that [...] "the text {{of the law is}} not clear." [...] In its aspects dealing with private property (Article 5), it might have violated Article 1 of the First Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportionality,</b> as well as additionally violating further aspects of the Hague Convention (The Laws and Customs of War on Land). A restriction and criminalisation of economic activities (Article 6) was contrary to the rule of customary international law, and also the IV Geneva Convention. The Commission also recommended [...] "to insert a clarifying provision" [...] into the law regarding basic documents issued by illegal authorities concerning the personal status.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the basic}} {{socio-economic}} problems {{is the problem of}} distribution of benefits and dues. The historically shaped <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> justice direct the {{solution to the problem of}} the Aristotelian rule <b>of</b> <b>proportionality.</b> But applying this rule not always gives the expected, satisfactory solutions. This occurs, for instance, regarding the allocation of seats among the member states in the European Parliament. For this reason, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> degressive <b>proportionality</b> was legitimized. Although the definition appears in the context of the European Parliament, the application of the rule distribution may be much wider due to certain universal priorities it embodies. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> degressive <b>proportionality,</b> however, has a significant drawback, namely, it does not clearly provide a exact division. This lack of clarity results in the fact that within the rule there may appear many different proposals. The article is an attempt to evaluate some of the proposals by the criterion of drawing nearer the most, under certain assumptions, degressively proportional allocation to the proportional one and proposing rules for determining the boundary conditions for such allocation...|$|R

5000|$|The {{legal concept}} of {{proportionality}} is recognised {{one of the}} general principles of European Union law by the European Court of Justice since the 1950s. It was first recognised by the European Court of Justice in Federation Charbonniere de Belgique v High Authority 1954 ECR 245 Case C8/55 and in Internationale Handelsgesellschaft v Einfuhr- und Vorratsstelle Getreide 1970 ECR 1125 Case 11/70 the European Advocate General provided an early formulation of the general <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> in stating that [...] "the individual should not have his freedom of action limited beyond the degree necessary in the public interest". The general concept of proportionality has since been further developed, notably in R v Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food ex parte Fedesa 1990 ECR 1-4023 Case C-331/88 in which a European directive prohibiting the use of certain hormonal substances in livestock farming was challenged. In its ruling the European Court of Justice held that {{by virtue of the}} general <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> the lawfulness of the Directive depended on whether it was appropriate and necessary to achieve the objectives legitimately pursued by the law in question. When there was a choice between several appropriate measures the least onerous must be adopted, and any disadvantage caused must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> is also recognised in Article 5 of the EC Treaty, stating that [...] "any action by the Community shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of this Treaty".|$|E
