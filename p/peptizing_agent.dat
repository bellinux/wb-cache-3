5000|$|Peptization is {{the process}} {{responsible}} {{for the formation of}} stable dispersion of colloidal particles in dispersion medium. In other words it may be defined as a process of converting a precipitate into colloidal sol by shaking it with dispersion medium in the presence of small amount of electrolyte. The electrolyte used in this process is called as <b>peptizing</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E
30|$|Depending on {{the nature}} of peptizing acid, the {{transformation}} of TiO 2 leads to anatase or rutile phase [64]. Formation of amorphous TiO 2 or metastable anatase phase was observed when the condensation initiated before hydrolysis of Ti precursor. Under highly acidic conditions, the rutile phase formation is favorable as the rate of condensation is slow. Accordingly, the rutile phase was obtained when sulfuric and nitric acids were used for the peptization. The use of weak acid (acetic acid) as a <b>peptizing</b> <b>agent</b> allows the control of both the degree of condensation and oligomerization and persuades the preferential crystallization of TiO 2 in the anatase phase. Zeng et al. [20] used polycarboxylic acid as a <b>peptizing</b> <b>agent</b> and observed the formation of nanoparticles of anatase which they attributed to chelation effect of organic acid.|$|E

It was expected that MoO 3 might serve only as deposited active phase but simultaneously also as <b>peptizing</b> <b>agent</b> improving mechanical strength and as thermal stabilizer inhibiting sintering of support surface area during calcination...|$|E
30|$|Due to {{extremely}} wide {{molecular weight}} distribution {{and the ability to}} form molecular aggregates at different intensity at different chemical and physical condition, only average chemical structures and properties of asphaltenes and resins could be established so far. Stability of asphaltene in crude oil depends upon a variety of factors (temperature, pressure, composition, pH, etc.) of which resin content in oil is attributed to have the greatest influence (Andersen and Speight 2001). It is an established fact that petroleum resins with lesser aromaticity but higher polarity compared with asphaltene act as <b>peptizing</b> <b>agents</b> and help stabilizing asphaltene–resin colloids. The mechanism behind this molecular association is believed to be due to opposite surface charge of resins and asphaltene moieties (Taylor 1998). It is observed that destabilization of colloidal asphaltene in oil production systems may occur if the surface charge and the resulting attraction forces between adsorbed resins and asphaltenes are disturbed (Leontaritis 1989; Alkafeef 2001). Later works of Fotland and Anfindsen (1996) and Behar et al. (1998) on electrical conductivity of asphaltene helped in understanding their molecular association phenomena in solution phase, while works of Igor and Aleksander (2010) on electrical conductivity of solid asphaltenes showed that asphaltenes in solid state behave like semiconductors, conductivity increasing at higher temperature, possibly due to structural phase transition.|$|R
30|$|A simple {{peptization}} {{method was}} adapted to synthesize TiO 2 nanoparticles by using sulfuric, nitric, and acetic acid as <b>peptizing</b> <b>agents</b> and titanium isopropoxide as Ti precursor. The influence of acid {{species on the}} crystal phase, morphology, textural, and surface composition of TiO 2 were studied in detail. The TiO 2 sample peptized with acetic acid possessed pure anatase phase, while the formation of minor (5 %) and major (67 %) of rutile phase was observed in case of samples peptized with sulfuric acid and nitric acid, respectively. It is observed that TiO 2 peptized with nitric acid showed sheet-like structures along with nanoparticles, while TiO 2 samples peptized with sulfuric and acetic acids possessed near spherical nanoparticles. The photocatalytic properties of synthesized TiO 2 nanostructures were evaluated for photodegradation of aqueous CV, MB, and p-NP solutions. The TiO 2 peptized using nitric acid showed the best photocatalytic activity than commercial P 25 and other two peptized samples, and its photodegradation efficiency was reached to 95 % in 120  min for p-NP degradation. Although TiO 2 samples peptized using sulfuric acid and acetic acid possessed smaller particle size, higher band gap energy, and high surface area, TiO 2 sample peptized with nitric acid possessed {{a higher percentage of}} rutile and photocurrent density. The observed photocurrent density is dominated by the photoactivity of TiO 2. The results indicate a direct correlation between the photocatalytic activity and the photocurrent density of the TiO 2 samples. The superior activity of TiO 2 sample peptized with nitric acid is due to the effective transfer of photogenerated electrons between rutile and anatase phases, and large pore diameter could have enhanced the diffusion and mass transportation of reacting molecules and OH radicals during the photochemical reaction. The synthesized TiO 2 photocatalysts can be recycled with a minor change in the activity.|$|R
40|$|Subject of Research. This work {{describes}} for {{the first}} time the formation of antireflective coating on the base of boehmite phase of AlOOH with low refractive index (1. 35) by inkjet printing on the nonporous substrate. This method gives the possibility to increase the contrast of colorful interfering images by 32 % obtaining by inkjet printing of titanium dioxide sol. The usage of this technology enables to obtain patterns with wide viewing angle and makes them highly stable. Methods. Traditional sol-gel method with <b>peptizing</b> <b>agents</b> and heating for 90 oC was applied for sol synthesis. Then the mixture was under sonic treatment for the obtaining of viscous sol. The viscosity was determined by Brookfield HA/HB viscometer, and the surface tension by Kyowa DY- 700 tensiometer. Aluminum oxide ink was deposited on polished slides (26 × 76 mm 2, Paul Marienfeld, Germany), over titanium oxide layer. To print titania ink, we use a desktop office printer Canon Pixma IP 2840 and Dimatix DMP- 2831. The thickness of an inkjet AlOOH layer after drying in the air and removal of the solvents did not exceed 150 nm with an RI not less than 1. 35 in the entire visible range. Results. The stable colloidal ink was obtained {{for the first}} time on the base of aluminum oxide matrix with neutral pH. The rheology was regulated by controlling parameters of sol-gel method in the system of aqueous titanium dioxide sol and by adding ethanol that affects the charge of double electrical layer of disperse phase. The controllable coalesce of drops enables to apply antireflection coating within the thickness accuracy of 10 nm. The morphology of particles and the topology of printed structures were analyzed by optical, scanning electron and atomic-force microscopes. Practical Relevance. We have proposed the approach to obtain colorful, interference patterns using two types of high refractive inks with different refractive indexes. The inkjet printing method opens new opportunities for preparing optical waveguides and forming photon-induction panels for new generation of computers...|$|R

In our study, the nanocrystalline titanium dioxide sols were prepared from TiCl 4 under acidic conditions. The powder was obtained with consequent drying of the sols at temperatures below 100 oC and these samples were then characterized using different techniques. The results show that the properties of the asprepared powders depend mainly on the type of the acid and less on the amount of the acid.

Analytical ultracentrifugation measurements show a particularly narrow particle distribution with an average particle size of about 3. 5 nm for pure CeO 2 and 2. 5 nm for pure ZrO 2 nanoparticles.

30|$|Titania (anatase) {{nanoparticles}} (of ~  4 – 6  nm {{in diameter}} [8, 13]) were synthesized in situ into Nafion 115 by the sol–gel method with a nominal concentration of C =  20  vol% [13]. The synthesis of Nafion–Titania composites (NT) consists basically in swelling the N 115 in ethanol for 1  h {{at room temperature}} to facilitate the access of titanium tetraisopropoxide (TIP/ 1  mol L− 1, Aldrich). Next, a <b>peptizing</b> <b>agent</b> {{is added to the}} solution to promote the controlled hydrolysis and condensation of nanoparticles. The formation of titania is promoted by the addition of hydrogen peroxide (30  vol%) to the solution in a 6.5 : 1 (H 2 O 2 :TIP) ratio. The condensation (crystallization) is carried out in an oven at 70  °C for 24  h. After the synthesis, the composite samples are washed firstly in H 2 SO 4 (0.5  mol L− 1) for 1  h, and finally in deionized water.|$|E
5000|$|Adsorbed {{proteins}} {{are among}} the most difficult food soils to remove from food contact surfaces. In particular, heat-denatured proteins (such as those found in dairy industry applications) adhere tightly to surfaces and require strong alkaline cleaners for removal. [...] It is important that cleaning methods are capable of removing both visible and non-visible protein soils. Nutrients for bacterial growth must be removed as well as biofilms that may have built up on the food contact surface. Proteins are water-insoluble, slightly soluble in acidic solutions and soluble in alkaline solutions, which limits the type of cleaner {{that can be used to}} remove protein from the surface. [...] Generally speaking, highly alkaline cleaners with <b>peptizing</b> and wetting <b>agents</b> are most effective in protein removal on food contact surfaces. [...] Cleaning temperature is also a concern for effective protein removal. As temperature increases, the activity of the cleaning compound increases, making soil removal easier. However, at higher temperatures (> 55°C) proteins denature and cleaning efficacy is reduced.|$|R
40|$|Presentwork {{is devoted}} to {{investigation}} of structure and functional properties of hybrid nanomaterials based on the TiO 2 -modified cellulose fibers of cotton. The titania hydrosol was successfully prepared using the titanium tetraisopropoxide as precursor and the nitric acid as <b>peptizing</b> <b>agent</b> via the low-temperature sol–gel synthesis in aqueous medium and applied to cotton fabric. For cross-linking of titania nanoparticles to cotton the 1, 2, 3, 4 -butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) {{was used as a}} spacer.

40|$|TiO 2 colloids {{with the}} most {{probably}} particle size of 10 nm were deposited {{on the surface of}} macroporous diatomite by a layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly method with using phytic acid as molecular binder. For preparation of colloidal TiO 2, titanium(IV) isopropoxicle (Ti(C 3 H 7 O) (4)) was used as titanium precursor, nitric acid (HNO 3) as <b>peptizing</b> <b>agent</b> and deionized water and isopropanol (C 3 H 7 OH) as solvent. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), N- 2 adsorption-desorption, and UV-vis spectra are used to assess the morphology and physical chemistry properties of the resulting TiO 2 coated diatomite. It was shown that the mesoporosity has been introduced into macroporous diatomite by LBL deposition. The mesoporosity was originated from close-packing of the uniform TiO 2 nanoparticles. More TiO 2 could be coated on the surface of diatomite by increasing the deposition cycles. This hierarchical porous material has potential for applications in catalytic reactions involved diffusion limit, especially in photocatalytic reactions. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Hydraulic {{transport}} of fine-grained suspensions through pipelines {{has been a}} progressive technology. Higher solids throughputs for economical considerations necessitate {{an increase in the}} solids concentration of the suspensions flowing in the pipelines. When increasing the solids concentration, the fine-grained suspensions could have non-Newtonian characteristics implying more complicated rheological behaviour. The suspension rheological behaviour is affected not only by the physical properties of its individual components but also by physical/chemical forces acting in slurry. One possibility for reducing the frictional losses in slurry pipe flow, and hence power requirement reduction, is based on change of physical-chemical behaviour of the slurry. The aim of study is experimentally investigate the possibility of energy and water requirement reduction for the suspension transport by pipes. The physical/chemical environment of slurry could be changed by a peptizing process. Kaolin slurries of different concentrations were tested in a pipeline test loop comprising laminar and turbulent regimes. Modified suspensions produced by changing the physical/chemical characteristics of kaolin slurries by the addition of a <b>peptizing</b> <b>agent</b> with different amounts were also tested. The study showed that the peptizing process results an ability to obtain higher concentration slurries with a significant decrease in apparent viscosity and yield stress.

30|$|The sol-gel {{synthesis}} {{method was}} used by utilizing the titanium alkoxide as Ti precursor at a mild temperature (<[*] 100  °C), and it yielded highly dispersed nanosized TiO 2 samples [16]. The chemical peptization method was adapted for the synthesis of stable metal oxide nanostructures including TiO 2 [19], where the coagulated suspension dissolves and recrystallizes into the stable solution of nanoparticles with the <b>peptizing</b> <b>agent</b> [20]. It was reported {{that the nature of}} peptizing acid has an effect on the physicochemical characteristics such as crystallite size, composition, and morphology of particles [21]. Zaban et al. [22] synthesized TiO 2 colloids with HNO 3 and CH 3 COOH under hydrothermal conditions and observed the formation of anatase and brookite mixture in both cases. Liu et al. [23] obtained TiO 2 hydrosol from metatitanic acid under different peptizing agents and studied the influence of peptizing conditions on the structural and photocatalytic properties of TiO 2 hydrosols. Kanna and Wongnawa [24] employed sol-gel synthesis method to obtain amorphous-anatase-rutile by using different acids such as HCl, HNO 3, H 2 SO 4, H 3 PO 4, and CH 3 COOH. The authors observed that presence of sulfate and phosphate groups are responsible for the inhibition of the growth of rutile phase. Later, Alphonse et al. [25] synthesized TiO 2 aggregates, which are composed of anatase and brookite phase by hydrolysis of titanium isopropoxide in a highly acidic medium. Parra et al. [26] studied the reaction pathway in the synthesis of anatase nanoparticles with acetic acid. They used FTIR and NMR techniques to conclude that acetate ions act as bidentate ligand between two Ti centers.|$|E
