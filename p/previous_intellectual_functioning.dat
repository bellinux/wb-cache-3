40|$|Background Persons {{with mild}} {{intellectual}} disability or borderline <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> are often studied {{as a single}} group with similar characteristics. However, {{there are indications that}} differences exist within this population. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} identify classes of persons with mild intellectual disability or borderline <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> and to examine whether these classes are related to individual and/or environmental characteristics. Methods Latent class analysis was performed using file data of 250 eligible participants with a mean age of 26. 1 (SD 13. 8, range 3 – 70) years. Results Five distinct classes of persons with mild intellectual disability or borderline <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> were found. These classes significantly differed in individual and environmental characteristics. For example, persons with a mild intellectual disability experienced fewer problems than those with borderline intellectual disability.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study aims to {{evaluate}} {{differences in the}} clinical profiles and use of psychiatric services by people with schizophrenia with and without borderline <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning.</b> Both groups {{in this study were}} receiving standard community psychiatric care. METHODS: A naturalistic sample of 372 people with schizophrenia completed the National Adult Reading Test. Data were collected prospectively over 18 months on psychiatric symptoms and service use. Three hundred and thirteen had normal <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> (mean age 43, range 20 - 76 years) and 59 had borderline or lower <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> (mean age 45, range 21 - 81 years). This was defined by a National Adult Reading Test error score of more than 40. RESULTS: People with borderline or lower <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> had a lower quality of life, more severe psychotic symptoms, reduced functioning and fewer antidepressant prescriptions. There {{were no significant differences in}} service use including hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS: People with schizophrenia and borderline or lower <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> are a more disabled group within general adult psychiatric services who should be the focus of initiatives for improved service delivery...|$|R
40|$|Autism {{classified}} {{based on}} social interaction and <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning.</b> Aim {{of this study}} was to find out the association between social interaction and <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning.</b> This hybride selective prevalence design study was conducted from January–March 2007 on autism children admitted to therapy center of Our Dream and Indigrow, Bandung. Subjects were classified based on social interaction and <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning.</b> Age and history of behavior therapy were confounding factors. Data was analyzed using Kruskall-Wallis and two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Subjects who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were 99 autism children. Subgroups aloof, passive, and active but odd were two, 31, 66 children, respectively. Low and high functioning were found in 70 and 29 children. Age of £ 5 and > 5 years were found in 58 and 41 children (pKW = 0. 453). Classification of behavioral therapy were 37 and 62 children (pKS = 1. 00). The association of social interaction with <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> autism showed significant value 0. 04.

40|$|Background There {{has been}} {{substantial}} {{increase in the number}} of people with mild intellectual disability (MID) or borderline <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> referred to long-term care. Insight into the specific characteristics and needs of these people is essential to provide appropriate support and gain insight into the increase in referrals. Method This retrospective descriptive study was based on a structured case analysis of a sample of 250 participants. Results Mental health problems and exposure to social and familial disadvantages were common. Care provided before referral tended to be suboptimal. Individuals with borderline <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> had more personal and contextual problems than people with MID. Conclusion People with MID or borderline <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> are confronted with a wide range of complex problems; even after years of professional support they may still need intensive support.

40|$|Neurofibromatosis- 1 is {{the most}} common single gene {{disorder}} affecting 1 in 3000. In children, it is associated not only with physical features but also with attention and learning problems. Research has identified a downward shift in <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> as well, but to date, there are no published studies about the everyday adaptive behavior of children with NF 1. In this study, parental reports of adaptive behavior of 61 children with NF 1 ages 3 through 8 were compared to an unaffected contrast group (n= 55) that comprised siblings and community members. Significant group differences in adaptive skills were evident and were largely related to group differences in <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning.</b> In a subsample of children with average-range <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning,</b> group differences in parent-reported motor skills were apparent even after controlling statistically for group differences in <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning.</b> The implications of the findings for the care of children with NF 1 are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Insufficient {{literature}} has been produced addressing children with borderline <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> (BIF) and gifted <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> (GIF).

40|$|In a 22 -year study, {{data were}} {{collected}} on aggressiveness and <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> in more than 600 subjects, their parents, and their children.

Early 1 Q was related to early subject aggression but did not predict changes in aggression after age 8. On the other hand, differences between early IQ and intellectual achievement in middle adulthood were predictable from early aggressive behavior. A dual-process model was offered to explain the relation between <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> and aggressive behavior.

The results are based on 18 independent, peer-reviewed publications from 1980 to 2017 that met criteria for this study. The findings yielded no consistent evidence of lower or higher intellectual quotient (IQ) in offspring of parents diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Some tentative evidence was found for lower performance IQ in offspring of bipolar parents as compared to controls. It is recommended that future research examine variability in <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> and potential moderators.

40|$|Williams {{syndrome}} (WS) is {{a developmental}} disorder of genetic origin, with characteristic cognitive and personality profiles. Studies of WS {{point to an}} outgoing and gregarious personality style, often contrasted with autism spectrum disorders; however, recent research has uncovered underlying social reciprocity difficulties in people with WS. Social information processing difficulties that underlie these social reciprocity difficulties have been sparsely examined. Participants {{in the current study}} included 24 children with WS ages 8 through 15. A lab-based measure of social perception and social cognition was administered (Social Attribution Test), as well as an <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> measure (KBIT-II) and parent reports of communication and reciprocal social skills (Social Communication Questionnaire, Social Responsiveness Scale). Relations between social cognition, cognitive abilities, and social-communication were examined. Results demonstrated relations between parent-reported social reciprocity and the typicality of the responses provided in the lab-based measure, even once variability in <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> was taken into account. Specifically, those individuals who produced narratives in response to the social attribution task (SAT) that were more similar to those described in previous studies of typically developing individuals were also reported to have fewer social reciprocity difficulties in the real world setting as reported by parents. In addition, a significant improvement in performance on the SAT was seen with added scaffolding, particularly for participants with stronger <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning.</b> These findings indicate that difficulties interpreting the social dynamics between others in ambiguous situations may contribute to the social relationship difficulties observed in people with WS, above and beyond the role of <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning.</b> Exploratory analyses indicated that performance by individuals with stronger <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> is improved with additional structure to a greater degree than for those with weaker <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning.</b> Interventions that specifically target these social information processing of individuals with WS would likely be beneficial...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three papers: a literature review, an empirical paper and a reflective paper. The literature review considers the validity of measures of premorbid <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> with people with varying levels of dementia severity. It aims to be of use to British clinicians by focussing specially on tests that were designed for use with a British English speaking population. No single measure of pre-morbid <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> {{is found to be}} valid for use with people of all levels of dementia severity. The use of multiple measures for estimating pre-morbid <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> are indicated. The empirical paper investigates the relationship between a person’s pre-morbid level of <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> and the amount of cognitive decline that they experience prior to gaining a diagnosis of dementia. It uses a retrospective correlational design to analyse data from existing memory clinic files. A significant positive Pearson’s correlation coefficient is found between pre-morbid <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> and amount of cognitive decline at the point of diagnosis, in all three of the diagnostic groups. This suggests that people with high pre-morbid functioning have to undergo greater cognitive decline before they are given a diagnosis of dementia. Changes to current clinical practice are indicated which take account of relative amounts of cognitive decline in the diagnostic process. Finally, a reflective account is presented which is based on the author’s thoughts and experiences of carrying out research in the field of dementia. This focuses on the challenges in accessing retrospective clinical data. Suggestions are made regarding future research and clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} parent {{reports of}} childhood symptoms of inattention {{as a predictor}} of adolescent academic achievement, taking into account the impact of the child’s <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning,</b> in two diagnostically and culturally diverse samples. Method: Samples: (a) an all-female sample in the U. S. predominated by youth with ADHD (Berkeley Girls with ADHD Longitudinal Study [BGALS], N = 202), and (b) a mixed-sex sample recruited from a Norwegian population-based sample (the Bergen Child Study [BCS], N = 93). Inattention and <b>intellectual</b> <b>function</b> were assessed via the same measures in the two samples; academic achievement scores during and beyond high school and demographic covariates were country-specific. Results: Childhood inattention predicted subsequent academic achievement in both samples, with a somewhat stronger effect in the BGALS sample, which included a large subgroup of children with ADHD. <b>Intellectual</b> <b>function</b> was another strong predictor, but the effect of early inattention remained statistically significant in both samples when <b>intellectual</b> <b>function</b> was covaried. Conclusion: The effect of early indicators of inattention on future academic success was robust across the two samples. These results support the use of remediation procedures broadly applied. Future longitudinal multicenter studies with pre-planned common inclusion criteria should be performed to increase our understanding of the importance of inattention in primary school children for concurrent and prospective functioning...|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} investigate, {{for the first}} time, rates of suicidal {{behaviour}} (ideation and acts) in people with borderline <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> in a general population sample, and to compare these to rates in people with normal functioning. Methods: We used data from the third Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, carried out in England in 2007. It {{was designed to be}} representative of people living in private households. The analyses are based on 6872 individuals. Results: 1053 (16. 1 %) participants met criteria for borderline <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning.</b> People with borderline <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> {{were more likely to report}} ever having made a suicidal attempt or to have harmed themselves without the intention of taking their own life (Odds Ratio for both 1. 7, 95 % Confidence Interval 1. 3 – 2. 2).

Limitations: Our sample did not include people living in segregate environments, who were likely to display challenging behaviours, and have higher rates of self harm. Conclusion: The increased rates of suicidal behaviour found in people with borderline <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> were explained by younger age and socioeconomic disadvantages, although the association is likely to be complex.

Few studies have investigated the effect of <b>intellectual</b> <b>function</b> on mental health in children with chronic illness (CI). The aim {{of the present study}} was twofold: First, we asked if normal to high <b>intellectual</b> <b>function</b> (IQ) has a protective effect on mental health in children with CI, and secondly, if this effect is more substantial than in their peers (NCI). Methods The participants were selected among children who participated in the Bergen Child Study (BCS) : 96 children with CI (the CI-group) and 96 children without CI (the NCI-group). The groups were matched on <b>intellectual</b> <b>function</b> as measured by the WISC-III by selecting the same number of children from three levels of the Full Scale IQ Score (FSIQ) : "very low" (84). CI was reported by parents as part of a diagnostic interview (Kiddie-SADS-PL) that also generated the mental health measures used in the present study: the presence of a DSM-IV psychiatric diagnosis and the score on the Children's Global Assessment Scale. Results The risk of a psychiatric diagnosis was significantly lower for children with a normal to high FSIQ-level than for children with a very low and low FSIQ-level in the CI-group as well as in the NCI-group.

40|$|Forty-nine {{children}} who had been placed in two different early intervention programs for high risk young children in an urban school system were evaluated at the end of programming on measures of <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning,</b> academic achievement, receptive language and general adjustment. One program had been established to deal with language impaired children and the other with general developmental delays. Neither group was considered to be retarded. A group of 30 children randomly selected but matched for the proportion of race, sex and age was established as a control. The purpose of the research was to explore the changes that had taken place {{over the course of the}} preschool experience and to determine if the children in the 2 ̆ 2 experimental 2 ̆ 2 groups had the potential for success in regular class programming. Emphasis was placed upon the relationship between <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> and achievement measures and between receptive language and <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning.</b> Concern was directed to the level of adjustment in all groups. A questionnaire designed to elicit attitudes in very young children towards the self and towards school was developed. Statistical procedures utilized chi-square, one-way and multivariate analysis of variance as well as tests of unequal variance. Repeated measures design was utilized to deal with pre- and post-experience results. Significance was determined at the. 05 level. Patterns of functioning that initially discriminated between the two experimental groups were still in existence at the end of programming. Intervention improves functioning at some point, but it does not result in average functioning unless the potential for this functioning is already present. Significant differences were found between all three groups on measures of <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning.</b> Academic functioning for all groups was commensurate with tested <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning.</b> Both the control and the language impaired group were significantly different from children in the non-categorical developmentally delayed group on measures of academic achievement and receptive language.

In addition, to study the association of <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> on brain volumes {{in children}} with ASD or developmental delay. METHODS: Thirty-four children with ASD and 13 developmentally delayed children without ASD, between 2 and 7 years old, matched on age and developmental level, participated in a MRI study. Volumes of cranium, total brain, cerebellum, grey and white matter, ventricles, hippocampus and amygdala were measured. RESULTS: No significant differences in volumes of intracranium, total brain, ventricles, cerebellum, grey or white matter or amygdala and hippocampus between the ASD group and the developmentally delayed group were found.

40|$|Cortical {{surface area}} has tremendously {{expanded}} during human evolution, and similar patterns of cortical expansion {{have been observed}} during childhood development. An intriguing hypothesis is that the high-expanding cortical regions also show the strongest correlations with <b>intellectual</b> <b>function</b> in humans. However, {{we do not know}} how the regional distribution of correlations between <b>intellectual</b> <b>function</b> and cortical area maps onto expansion in development and evolution. Here, in a sample of 1048 participants, we show that regions in which cortical area correlates with visuospatial reasoning abilities are generally high expanding in both development and evolution. Several regions in the frontal cortex, especially the anterior cingulate, showed high expansion in both development and evolution. The area of these regions was related to <b>intellectual</b> <b>functions</b> in humans. Low-expanding areas were not related to cognitive scores. These findings suggest that cortical regions involved in higher <b>intellectual</b> <b>functions</b> have expanded the most during development and evolution. The radial unit hypothesis provides a common framework for interpretation of the findings in the context of evolution and prenatal development, while additional cellular mechanisms, such as synaptogenesis, gliogenesis, dendritic arborization, and intracortical myelination, likely impact area expansion in later childhood.

40|$|Generic skills include {{transferable}} skills which contribute to general work skills {{of an individual}} {{and can be used}} in different jobs and work organizations. Situational assessment is considered to be the best approach in gathering information on generic skills and adaptive behavior in persons with intellectual disabilities (ID), since it enables systematic observation of work related behavior. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine the relation of the degree of generic skills acquisition with regard to the level of <b>intellectual</b> <b>functioning</b> of students with mild intellectual disability (MID). The sample consists of 120 examinees undergoing professional training, of both genders, with IQ between 51 and 70.
