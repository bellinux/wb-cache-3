40|$|Multiple input {{multiple}} output radars transmit partially coherent or noncoherent waveforms {{for improving}} spatial resolution or spatial diversity. While waveform design for SIMO radars concentrate on improving the delay and Doppler resolution characteristics, waveform design for MIMO radars involve optimization of delay, Doppler and spatial resolution characteristics. The resolution properties of MIMO radar transmit waveforms is studied using the MIMO radar ambiguity function. MIMO radar ambiguity function of frequency hopping waveforms is recently derived. Considering the many advantages of phase coded <b>pulse</b> <b>waveforms</b> in radar applications, this paper derives the MIMO radar ambiguity function of phased coded <b>pulse</b> <b>waveforms.</b> Further, a numerical optimization algorithm based on simulated annealing is proposed for designing {{parameters of the}} phase coded <b>pulse</b> <b>waveforms</b> that minimize {{the peak of the}} ambiguity function at all mismatched values of delay, Doppler and angular dimensions...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} {{manual for}} the SID mentions that if several waveforms are enabled {{at the same}} time, {{the result will be}} a binary AND between them. What happens in reality is that the input to the waveform DAC pins receive several waveforms at once. For instance, the Triangle waveform is made with a separate XOR circuit and a shift-to-left circuit. The top bit drives whether the XOR circuit inverts the accumulator value seen by the DAC. Thus, enabling triangle and sawtooth simultaneously causes adjacent accumulator bits in the DAC input to mix. (The XOR circuit does not come to play because it is always disabled whenever the sawtooth waveform is selected.) The <b>pulse</b> <b>waveform</b> is built by joining all the DAC bits together via a long strip of polysilicon, connected to the pulse control logic that digitally compares current accumulator value to the pulse width value. Thus, selecting the <b>pulse</b> <b>waveform</b> together with any other waveform causes every bit on the DAC to partially mix, and the loudness of the waveform is affected by the state of the pulse.|$|E
50|$|Erroneously low {{readings}} may {{be caused}} by hypoperfusion of the extremity being used for monitoring (often due to a limb being cold, or from vasoconstriction secondary to the use of vasopressor agents); incorrect sensor application; highly calloused skin; or movement (such as shivering), especially during hypoperfusion. To ensure accuracy, the sensor should return a steady pulse and/or <b>pulse</b> <b>waveform.</b> Pulse oximetry technologies differ in their abilities to provide accurate data during conditions of motion and low perfusion.|$|E

40|$|Analysis of {{arterial}} <b>pulse</b> <b>waveforms</b> {{is important}} for non-invasive diagnosis of cardiovascular functions. Large samples of IPG signal records of radial arterial pulse show presence of eight different types of shapes (morphological patterns) in the <b>pulse</b> <b>waveforms.</b> In this paper we present an efficient computational method for automatic identification of these morphological patterns. Our algorithm uses likelihood ratio of cumulative periodogram of pulse signals and some geometrical criteria. The algorithm is presented with necessary details on signal processing aspects. Results for a large sample of pulse records of adult Indian subjects show high accuracy of our algorithm in detecting pulse-morphology patterns. Variation of pulse-morphology with respect to time is also analyzed using this algorithm. We have identified some characteristic features of pulse-morphology variation in patients of certain cardiac problems, hypertension, and diabetes. These are found relevant and significant in terms of physiological interpretation of the associated shapes of <b>pulse</b> <b>waveforms.</b> Importance of these findings is highlighted along with discussion on overall scope of our study in automatic analysis of heart rate variability and in other applications for non-invasive prognosis/diagnosis...|$|R

However, adult apteronotids are one exception, as theirs are derived from nerve cells (spinal electromotor neurons). In gymnotiforms, the electric organ discharge may be continuous or pulsed.

50|$|PWM is {{sometimes}} used in sound (music) synthesis, in particular subtractive synthesis, as {{it gives a}} sound effect similar to chorus or slightly detuned oscillators played together. (In fact, PWM {{is equivalent to the}} difference of two sawtooth waves with one of them inverted.http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Mar03/articles/synthsecrets47.asp) The ratio between the high and low level is typically modulated with a low frequency oscillator. In addition, varying the duty cycle of a <b>pulse</b> <b>waveform</b> in a subtractive-synthesis instrument creates useful timbral variations. Some synthesizers have a duty-cycle trimmer for their square-wave outputs, and that trimmer can be set by ear; the 50% point (true square wave) was distinctive, because even-numbered harmonics essentially disappear at 50%. Pulse waves, usually 50%, 25%, and 12.5%, make up the soundtracks of classic video games.|$|E
50|$|The better {{manufacturing}} {{technology in the}} 8580 used in the later revisions of Commodore 64C and the Commodore 128DCR caused the bias to almost entirely disappear, causing the digitized sound samples to become very quiet. Fortunately, the volume level could be mostly restored with either a hardware modification (biasing the audio-in pin), or more commonly a software trick involving using the <b>Pulse</b> <b>waveform</b> to intentionally recreate the required bias. The software trick generally renders one voice temporarily unusable, although clever musical compositions can make this problem less noticeable. An excellent example of this quality improvement noticeably reducing a sampled channel {{can be found in}} the introduction to Electronic Arts' game Skate or Die (1987). The guitar riff played is all but missing when played on the Commodore 64c or the Commodore 128.|$|E
50|$|The carrier is an RF signal, {{typically}} of microwave frequencies, {{which is}} usually (but not always) modulated to allow the system to capture the required data. In simple ranging radars, the carrier will be pulse modulated and in continuous wave systems, such as Doppler radar, modulation may not be required. Most systems use pulse modulation, with or without other supplementary modulating signals. Note that with pulse modulation, the carrier is simply switched on and off {{in sync with the}} pulses; the modulating waveform does not actually exist in the transmitted signal and the envelope of the <b>pulse</b> <b>waveform</b> is extracted from the demodulated carrier in the receiver. Although obvious when described, this point is often missed when pulse transmissions are first studied, leading to misunderstandings {{about the nature of the}} signal.|$|E

5000|$|Frank's initial {{research}} {{was related to}} fat absorption.

Frank's work on this topic preceded that of Ernest Starling, but both are usually credited with providing the foundations of what is termed the Frank-Starling law of the heart. This law states that [...] "Within physiological limits, the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of the muscle fiber". Frank also undertook important work into the physiological basis of the arterial <b>pulse</b> <b>waveform</b> and may have coined the term essential hypertension in 1911. His work on the Windkessel extended the original ideas of Stephen Hales and provided a sound mathematical framework for this approach. Frank also published on waves in the arterial system but his attempts to produce a theory that incorporated waves and the Windkessel are not considered to have been successful. Frank also did work on the oscillatory characteristics of the auditory apparatus of the ear and the thermodynamics of muscle. He also worked extensively on developing accurate methods to measure blood pressure and other physiological phenomena (e.g. Frank's capsule (Frank-Kapsel), optical Spiegelsphygmograph).|$|E
