40|$|Indexing high {{dimensional}} datasets {{has attracted}} extensive attention from many {{researchers in the}} last decade. Since R-tree type of index structures are known as suffering curse of dimensionality problems, Pyramid-tree type of index structures, {{which are based on}} the B-tree, have been proposed to break the curse of dimensionality. However, for high dimensional data, the number of pyramids is often insufficient to discriminate data points when the number of dimensions is high. Its effectiveness degrades dramatically with the increase of dimensionality. In this paper, we focus on one particular issue of curse of dimensionality; that is, the surface of a hypercube in a high dimensional space approaches 100 % of the total hypercube volume when the number of dimensions approaches infinite. We propose a new indexing method based on the surface of dimensionality. We prove that the <b>Pyramid</b> <b>tree</b> technology is a special case of our method. The results of our experiments demonstrate clear priority of our novel method. <br /...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMobile crowd {{photography}} (MCP) is {{a widely}} used technique in crowd sensing. In MCP, a picture stream is generated when delivering intermittently to the backend server by participants. Pictures contributed later in the stream may be semantically or visually relevant to previous ones, which can result in data redundancy. To meet diverse constraints (e. g., spatiotemporal contexts, single or multiple shooting angles) on the data to be collected in MCP tasks, a data selection process is needed to eliminate data redundancy and reduce network overhead. This issue has little been investigated in existing studies. To address this requirement, we propose a generic data collection framework called PicPick. It first presents a multifaceted task model that allows for varied MCP task specification. A <b>pyramid</b> <b>tree</b> (PTree) method is further proposed to select an optimal set of pictures from picture streams based on multi-dimensional constraints. Experimental results on two real-world datasets indicate that PTree can effectively reduce data redundancy while maintaining the coverage requests, and the overall framework is flexibl...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The bag-of-visual-words (BOVW) {{approaches}} {{are widely used}} in human action recognition. Usually, large vocabulary size of the BOVW is more discriminative for inter-class action classification while small one is more robust to noise and thus tolerant to the intra-class invariance. In this pape, we propose a <b>pyramid</b> vocabulary <b>tree</b> to model local spatio-temporal features, which can characterize the inter-class difference and also allow intra-class variance. Moreover, since BOVW is geometrically unconstrained, we further consider the spatio-temporal information of local features and propose a sparse spatio-temporal pyramid matching kernel (termed as SST-PMK) to compute the similarity measures between video sequences. SST-PMK satisfies the Mercer’s condition and therefore is readily integrated into SVM to perform action recognition. Experimental results on the Weizmann datasets show that both the <b>pyramid</b> vocabulary <b>tree</b> and the SST-PMK lead to a significant improvement in human action recognition.

50|$|Fruit {{trees are}} grown {{in a variety}} of shapes, {{sometimes}} to please the eye but mainly to encourage fruit production. The form or shape of fruit trees can be manipulated by pruning and training. Shaping and promoting a particular tree form is done to establish the plant in a particular situation under certain environmental conditions, to increase fruit yield, and to enhance fruit quality. For example, pruning a <b>tree</b> to a <b>pyramid</b> shape enables <b>trees</b> to be planted closer together. An open bowl or cup form helps sunlight penetrate the canopy, thus encouraging a high fruit yield whilst keeping the tree short and accessible for harvesting. Other shapes such as cordons, espaliers and fans offer opportunities for growing trees two dimensionally against walls or fences, or they can be trained to function as barriers.|$|R
