5|$|Agriculture in Wales has in {{the past}} been {{a major part of the}} economy of Wales, a largely rural country that forms part of the United Kingdom. Wales is mountainous and has a mild, wet climate. This results in only a small <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land area being {{suitable}} for arable cropping, but grass for the grazing of livestock is present in abundance. As a <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national economy, the importance of agriculture has become much reduced; a high <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population now live in the towns and cities in the south of the country and tourism has become an important form of income in the countryside and on the coast. Arable cropping is limited to the flatter parts and elsewhere dairying and livestock farming predominate.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{population}} who died, the London death toll was less severe {{than in a}} number of other towns. The total of deaths in London was greater than in any previous outbreak for 100 years, though as a <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population, the epidemics in 1563, 1603 and 1625 were comparable or greater. Perhaps around 2.5% of the English population died.|$|E

30|$|Fisher’s {{exact test}} was used to compare <b>the</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study types and levels of {{evidence}} by year of publication, and to compare <b>the</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study types and levels of evidence by journal. Fisher’s exact test was also used to examine <b>the</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study types and levels of evidence by year <b>of</b> publication within <b>the</b> five different journals. All statistical analysis was performed using Stata/IC version 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.|$|R

5|$|A further {{complication}} is that {{a certain}} <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Allied manpower was needed to man the fleet, which amounted to at least 110 triremes, and thus approximately 22,000 men. Since the Battle of Mycale was fought at least near-simultaneously with the Battle of Plataea, then this was a pool of manpower which could not have contributed to Plataea, and further reduces the likelihood that 110,000 Greeks assembled before Plataea.|$|E
5|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{found that}} psychological therapy {{is effective in}} reducing self-harm. The <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adolescents who self-harmed over the follow-up period was lower in the intervention groups (28%) than in controls (33%). Psychological therapies with the largest effect sizes were dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT), cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), and mentalization-based therapy (MBT).|$|E

5|$|After Georgia's {{outstanding}} 1896 performance, Warner {{returned to}} his alma mater Cornell at twice his Georgia salary. While remaining head coach at Iowa State, he coached Cornell to records of 5–3–1 in 1897 and 10–2 in 1898; in the latter season, Cornell outscored its opponents 296–29. Despite its 1898 success, tension existed within the team, as its assistant coach (backed by a large <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> players) lobbied to replace Warner. Acknowledging an issue with his leadership, Warner resigned.|$|E
5|$|After secretion, only a {{very small}} <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thyroid hormones travel freely in the blood. Most are bound to thyroxine-binding {{globulin}} (about 70%), transthyretin (10%), and albumin (15%). Only the 0.03% of T4 and 0.3% of T3 traveling freely has hormonal activity. In addition, up to 85% of the T3 in blood is produced following conversion from T4 by iodothyronine deiodinases in organs around the body.|$|E

5|$|Another {{large group}} of victims was {{composed}} of German and foreign civilian activists {{across the political spectrum}} who opposed the Nazi regime, captured resistance fighters (many of whom were executed during—or immediately after—their interrogation, particularly in occupied Poland and France) and, sometimes, their families. German political prisoners were a substantial <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first inmates at Dachau (the prototypical Nazi concentration camp). The political People's Court was notorious for the number of its death sentences.|$|E
5|$|At present, the {{majority}} of the frieze is at the British Museum in London (forming the major part of the Elgin Marbles); the largest <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest is in Athens, and the remainder of fragments shared between six other institutions. Casts of the frieze may be found in the Beazley archive at the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, at the Spurlock Museum in Urbana, in the Skulpturhalle at Basel and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Soviet Tartu Operation, the ratio of Soviet to German strength was 4.3:1 for troops, 14.8:1 for artillery and 4.1:1 for armour. The German forces were mostly battle groups from various formations and smaller units from different branches. A significant <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German side was constituted of Omakaitse militia battalions with poor weaponry and little fighting ability.|$|E

5|$|Each {{radioactive}} isotope has a characteristic decay time period—the half-life—that {{is determined by}} the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an exponential decay process that steadily decreases the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth.|$|E
5|$|In 1670, Charles II {{incorporated}} by royal charter the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), granting it {{a monopoly on}} the fur trade in the area known as Rupert's Land, which would later form a large <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dominion of Canada. Forts and trading posts established by the HBC were frequently the subject of attacks by the French, who had established their own fur trading colony in adjacent New France.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to works of art, a large <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Museum's collection {{consists of the}} artefacts of the imperial court. This includes items used by the imperial family and the palace in daily life, as well as various ceremonial and bureaucratic items important to government administration. This comprehensive collection preserves the daily life and ceremonial protocols of the imperial era.|$|E

5|$|In the October 1959 general {{election}} the Conservatives, now led by Harold Macmillan, increased their majority in parliament to 100 seats. In Liverpool Exchange Bessie defied the national swing, and increased her <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vote. On a reduced turnout her personal majority fell slightly, to 6,971.|$|E
5|$|Later {{fires in}} 1706 and 1864 {{destroyed}} most medieval and Georgian architecture, {{and a large}} <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town's listed buildings date from the Victorian period onwards. However, many of the pasture fields {{on the outskirts of}} the town have evidence of ridge and furrow farming practices, although these are under threat by current building proposals.|$|E
5|$|Such {{recycling}} of revenue from permit auctions could offset a significant <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy-wide {{social costs of}} a cap and trade scheme. As well as reducing tax distortions, Kerr and Cramton (1998) note that auctions of units are more flexible in distributing costs, they provide more incentives for innovation, and they lessen the political arguments over the allocation of economic rents.|$|E
