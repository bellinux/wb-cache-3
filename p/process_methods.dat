Smaller-scale production involves the traditional batch processes. The three variations are the cold process, wherein the reaction takes place substantially at room temperature; the semi-boiled or [...] "hot process," [...] wherein the reaction takes place near the boiling point; and the fully boiled process, wherein the reactants are boiled at least once and the glycerol is recovered. There are several types of semi-boiled hot <b>process</b> <b>methods,</b> the most common being DBHP (Double Boiler Hot Process) and CPHP (Crock Pot Hot Process). Most soapmakers, however, continue to prefer the cold process method. The cold process and hot process (semi-boiled) are the simplest, and are typically used by small artisans and hobbyists producing handmade decorative soaps. The glycerol remains in the soap and the reaction continues for many days after the soap is poured into molds. The glycerol is left during the hot-process method, but at the high temperature employed, the reaction is practically completed in the kettle, before the soap is poured into molds. This simple and quick process is employed in small factories all over the world.|$|E

The center was established to help the company meet United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements, research improved manufacturing and <b>process</b> <b>methods,</b> and develop future innovative technologies. In 1975, BD Pharmaceutical Systems Europe acquired an important patent for a prefilled syringe injecting heparin. In 1980, BD developed its first automated system for mycobacteria testing—the BD BACTEC 460TB System. The next year brought significant signs of the company’s development as sales surpassed the $1 billion milestone and a new plant in Plymouth, England was constructed to serve the European markets. Five years later BD moved its corporate headquarters to Franklin Lakes, New Jersey (current HQ location.) Also in 1986, BD acquired Fabersanitas Industrial, a major Spanish syringe manufacturer as well as Deseret Medical, a vascular access devices manufacturer. The last {{three years of the}} 1980s also showed growth in Asia (manufacturing facilities in Singapore and Japan.) Furthermore, BD became the first company to introduce a safety-engineered syringe—BD Safety-Lok (1988) and acquired the Beaver Blade Company, a manufacturer of high-quality surgical blades. The first half of the next decade was very important to BD’s development. The company opened a central distribution center in Temse, Belgium (1992) and entered India and China (1995.)

5000|$|The {{rotary vacuum}} drum filter designs {{available}} vary in physical aspects and their characteristics. The filtration area ranges from 0.5 m2 to 125 m2. Disregarding {{the size of}} the design, filter cloth washing is a priority as it ensures efficiency of cake washing and acting vacuum. However, a smaller design would be more economical as the maintenance, energy usage and investment cost would be less than a bigger rotary vacuum drum filter.Over the years, the technology drive has pushed development to further heights revolving around rotary vacuum drum filter in terms of design, performance, maintenance and cost. This has also {{led to the development of}} smaller rotary drum vacuum filters, ranging from laboratory scale to pilot scale, both of which can be used for smaller applications (such as at a lab in a university) [...] High performance capacity, optimised filtrate drainage with low flow resistance and minimal pressure loss are just a few of the benefits. With advanced control systems prompting automation, this has reduced the operation of attention needed hence, reducing the operational cost. Advancements in technology also means that precoat can be cut to 1/20th the thickness of human hair, thus making the use of precoat more efficient [...] Lowered operational and capital cost can also be achieved nowadays due to easier maintenance and cleaning. Complete cell emptying can be done quickly with the installation of leading and trailing pipes.Given that the filter cloth is usually one of the more expensive component in the rotary vacuum drum filter build up, priority on its maintenance must be kept quite high. A longer lifetime, protection from damage and consistent performance are the few criteria that must not be overlooked.Besides considering production cost and quality, cake washing and cake thickness are essential issues that are important in the <b>process.</b> <b>Methods</b> have been performed to ensure a minimal amount of cake moisture while undergoing good cake washing with large cake dewatering angle.

However, many {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) struggle to implement or perform distributed collaborative design effectively or even at all. As part of the extended design team of large multinational companies {{it is not uncommon for}} SMEs to have collaborative working tools and practice imposed on them to meet the requirements of the multinational. However, many SMEs need to develop their own working practices to support effective, collaborative team design within their own organization or their extended design team. Through a series of case studies, this paper describes how a typical SME achieved successful distributed team design within their organization. A "strategy for effective distributed team design" encompassing the <b>processes,</b> <b>methods,</b> and tools developed and implemented within the company to achieve this success, is presented. In total, four live case studies, spanning a 2 -year period, are described; two initial studies focus on current distributed design team practice clearly highlighting issues and areas for improvement, leading to the development of <b>processes,</b> <b>methods,</b> and tools to support distributed collaborative team design.
