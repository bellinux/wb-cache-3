5|$|The 2013 season saw Bumgarner set career bests for ERA (2.77), walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) (1.03) and strikeouts (199) in 31 starts, {{finishing}} with a 13–9 record. Bumgarner's WHIP {{was the lowest}} for a Giants' left-hander since Carl Hubbell's in 1933. Bumgarner was also selected by Giants manager Bruce Bochy and {{the manager of the}} National League team, to <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> All Star game for the first time. However, Bumgarner didn't <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game.|$|E
5|$|Zito's {{regular season}} {{performance}} with the Giants was less successful; he went 63–80 with a 4.62 ERA. However, he had significantly more playoff success with them. Aided by his contributions in 2010, the team won its first World Series since 1954. Zito did not <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> playoffs that year, but did <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2012 postseason, saving the Giants' season by pitching {{them to a}} Game 5 victory in the NLCS against the Cardinals, and then outdueling Tigers' ace Justin Verlander in Game 1 of the 2012 World Series. The Giants {{went on to win}} their second World Series in three years.|$|E
5|$|On June 4, {{playing at}} Connie Mack Stadium against the Phillies, Koufax walked Richie Allen {{on a very}} close full-count <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth inning. Allen, who was thrown out trying to steal second, was the only Phillie to reach base that day. With his third no-hitter in three years, Koufax became only the second pitcher of the modern era (after Bob Feller) to pitch three no-hitters.|$|E
50|$|Hurst <b>pitched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{minor leagues}} from 1987 to 1994 {{and again in}} 1998, going 51-38 with a 3.63 ERA in 206 games (110 starts). He <b>pitched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rangers' (1987-1991, 1998), Expos' (1991-1993), Dodgers' (1993) and Mets' (1994) organizations.|$|R
2500|$|His brothers, Alfred Womack and Larry Womack, were {{minor league}} {{pitchers}} who never reached the major leagues.

5|$|The Red Sox {{suffered}} a collapse {{late in the}} 2011 season, losing their playoff positioning. A source among the Red Sox claimed that Josh Beckett, Jon Lester, and John Lackey spent games they did not <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clubhouse eating fried chicken and drinking beer; some Red Sox teammates speculated that Youkilis {{was the source of}} this information, alienating him from his teammates.|$|E
5|$|When Strømmen IF were {{promoted}} to First Division {{ahead of the}} 1986 season, the team originally announced that they would play their fall games at Åråsen, as Strømmen Stadion {{was in need of}} a new <b>pitch.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, Strømmen only played one of their matches at Åråsen, drawing 1–1 against Rosenborg on 10 August 1986 in front of 1,649 spectators.|$|E
5|$|As a manager, Virdon led the Pirates to the 1972 NL East {{division}} title, but the Pirates {{lost the}} 1972 National League Championship Series (NLCS) to the Cincinnati Reds when Pittsburgh pitcher Bob Moose unleashed a wild <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final inning of Game 5, allowing {{the winning run}} to score. The 1973 Pirates had to play without Clemente, who died during the previous offseason. Further struggles included pitcher Steve Blass' inability to throw strikes and injuries to Dock Ellis. In 1973, Virdon clashed with Ellis and Richie Hebner, and the Pirates fell into third place, with a 67–69 record, and the team fired Virdon, replacing him with Murtaugh.|$|E

5|$|Assonance, {{where the}} use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the {{beginning}} or end of a word, was widely used in skaldic poetry, but {{goes back to the}} Homeric epic. Because verbs carry much of the <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry. Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word. Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.|$|E
5|$|Belgium's 1920 Olympic squad {{was given}} a bye into the quarter-finals, where they won 3–1 against Spain, and reached the semi-finals, where they beat the Netherlands 3–0. In {{the first half of}} their final against Czechoslovakia, the Belgians led 2–0. Forward Robert Coppée {{converted}} a disputed early penalty, and the action in which attacker Henri Larnoe doubled the score was also a matter of debate. After the dismissal of the Czechoslovak left-back Karel Steiner, the discontented visitors left the <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 40th minute. Afterwards, the away team reported their reasons for protest to the Olympic organisation; these complaints were dismissed and the Czechoslovaks were disqualified. The 2–0 score was allowed to stand and Belgium were crowned the champions.|$|E
5|$|Boyd {{played only}} one more match for the club, {{two weeks after the}} Cup Final. Not risked in their first match in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, against Internazionale on a hard <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> San Siro, he played in their next, a 1–0 win against a Zagreb Select XI in Yugoslavia. Following a {{favourable}} specialist's report during the close season, Boyd took part in pre-season training, but his back still troubled him. On 17 August 1956, the day before Birmingham were to open their 1956–57 League campaign, Boyd's contract with the club was terminated at his own request.|$|E

5|$|Everton {{originally}} {{played on}} an open <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south-east corner of the newly laid out Stanley Park, the same site where Liverpool F.C. planned a stadium, however abandoned the project. The first official match took place in 1879. In 1882, a Mr J. Cruit donated land at Priory Road with the necessary facilities required for professional clubs. Cruit asked the club to leave his land after two years because the crowds became far too large and noisy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} inning, the Yankees cut the Cardinals' lead. With two outs, Joe Dugan hit a single. Hank Severeid {{followed}} with a double, scoring Dugan, before pinch-hitter Ben Paschal grounded to Haines to end the inning. Game1 and 5 winner Herb Pennock came in relief for Hoyt in the seventh inning. He yielded only one hit in the inning and limited the Cardinals to their 3–2 lead. In {{the bottom half of}} the inning, the Yankees loaded up the bases with Earle Combs, Ruth and Lou Gehrig. At this point, there were two outs, and Haines had developed a blister on his pitching hand, and could no longer <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Jerome McGinnity (March 20, 1871– November 14, 1929) was an American {{right-handed}} {{pitcher in}} Major League Baseball (MLB) {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th century. McGinnity played in MLB for ten years, pitching for the National League's (NL) Baltimore Orioles (1899) and Brooklyn Superbas (1900), before jumping to the American League (AL) {{to play for the}} Baltimore Orioles (AL) (1901–1902).

5|$|Pineda was {{selected}} to the All-Star Game on July 10 {{as a replacement for}} Justin Verlander, who was ineligible to <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> All-Star Game due to having pitched the day before the All-Star break. He was 8–6 at that point, but with a 3.03 ERA and 113 strikeouts in 113 innings, against only 36 walks. In the All-Star Game, Pineda pitched one perfect inning, striking out Scott Rolen and Rickie Weeks.|$|E
5|$|Stricklett {{learned the}} spitball from minor league {{teammate}} George Hildebrand in 1902, who {{learned about it}} from Frank Corridon. Stricklett {{played an important role}} in popularizing the spitball. Stricklett taught the spitball to Jack Chesbro, who saw him use the pitch while pitching in minor league baseball. Though Chesbro had experimented with the <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minor leagues, Stricklett showed him how to master it in 1904. Stricklett taught it to Ed Walsh while they roomed together with the White Sox.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, Sunderland {{reached the}} Second Division {{play-off}} final, after beating Newcastle United in the semi-final. During the second {{leg of the}} semi-final at St. James' Park, some Newcastle fans, seeing their team down 2–0 with only five minutes remaining, invaded the <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope of forcing an abandonment. However, the game was resumed and Sunderland completed the win. In the play-off final, Sunderland lost 1–0 against Swindon Town at Wembley. However Sunderland were promoted {{a few weeks later}} in place of Swindon, who were kept in the Second Division after admitting financial irregularities.|$|E

50|$|Despite never <b>pitching</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> majors again, Rogers <b>pitched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minors until 1998. In 1995, he {{appeared}} {{in a total of}} seven games - five of which were starts - while splitting time between San Jose and Phoenix. Combined, he went 0-2 with a 2.51 ERA in 14 innings of work. He struck out a total of six batters.|$|R
5|$|Adams {{also worked}} {{occasionally}} as an umpire in significant games. One notable example {{was the final}} contest of a three-game series between all-star teams from Brooklyn and New York City, held on September 10, 1858, in Long Island. During the game, which the New York City all-stars won 29–18, Adams became the first umpire to use a new rule allowing for a strike to be called against a batter who did not swing at a <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> strike zone. Previously, strikes were only called when a batter swung at a pitch and missed. Three batters were ruled out on strikes called by Adams in the game. Otherwise, the called strike rule was not applied often in its {{first few years of}} existence.|$|E
5|$|As part of Strasburg's {{rehabilitation}} {{from his}} Tommy John surgery, {{and as a}} precaution due to his low innings total in 2011, the Nationals decided {{to limit the number}} of innings Strasburg would throw in the 2012 season. Although the number was never official, rumors started that Strasburg's limit would be between 160 and 180 innings. It was also decided that Strasburg's shutdown would be final; he would not <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> playoffs. Dr. Lewis Yocum, the surgeon who operated on Strasburg's elbow, agreed in 2011 that Strasburg's 2012 innings total should be limited, although he did not consult with Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo or Strasburg during the season. Teammate Jordan Zimmermann underwent a similar process the year before.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the season, Wensloff {{remained}} a major part of the starting rotation. His losses included a 10 defeat in which he only allowed one unearned run on a wild throw against the St. Louis Browns. During the season, Wensloff added a knuckleball to his selection of pitches, which he threw regularly during the season. As the end of the season approached, Wensloff was being promoted as a rookie of the year candidate, due to being second on the team in strikeouts, as well as his 13 wins. Wensloff finished the season with a 13–11 record and a 2.54 ERA in 29 games, 27 of them starts. He did not <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1943 World Series, though he was on the roster.|$|E
