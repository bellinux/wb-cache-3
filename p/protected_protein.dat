40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} additional <b>protected</b> <b>protein</b> and energy on intake and digestion in lambs, a trial was conducted using 36 young sheep (average body weight 24. 8 _+ 1. 7 kg) in a completely randomized design. Combination of three levels of <b>protected</b> <b>protein</b> (0, 10 and 20 %, based on the dry matter of the concentrate offered) and three levels of protected energy (0, 5, 10 %, based on the dry matter of the concentrate offered) were added into concentrate diet and fed to growing sheep. Results showed that different levels of feed additive did not affect (P> 0. 05) intake of dry matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber and metabolizable energy, with average of 76. 3 g, 68. 9 g, 31. 2 g, 16. 79 g and 0. 75 MJ /kg BW 0. 75 respectively.

Experiment 1 was executed {{to study the}} effect of feeding different rations of <b>protected</b> <b>protein</b> of canola meal on digestibility and nutritive values within sheep. Twenty male, healthy sheep were divided into five treatments according to the methods of protein protection (control, heat, sodium hydroxide, formaldehyde, and acetic acid treatments). Experiment 2 was carried out on developing lambs to investigate the effect of <b>protected</b> <b>protein</b> on growth performance and some blood metabolites. Animals in this ex-periment were also divided into the same treatments as Experiment 1. Animals {{in the first and}} second experiment were fed concentrate ration (80 %) and wheat straw (20 %) to cover the feed requirements. Nutritive values expressed as total digestible nutrients (TDN %) and digestible crude protein (DCP%) of the experimental rations was calculated. In the second experimental all animals were weighed biweekly and the amounts of rations were adjusted throughout the experimental period (120 days) according to their body weight change. Results indicated that in the first experimental <b>protected</b> <b>protein</b> by heat (HE) and sodium hydroxide (NH) had positive (P< 0. 05) effects on most of digestibility coefficients of different nutrients. Protein protection methods also improved (P< 0. 05) the nutritive values (TDN and DCP) in the HE treatment and NH treatment. In the second experiment body weight increased by 14 % and 7 % and also daily gain by 27 % and 14 % in HE and NH, respectively, while FM and AC decreased body weight by 8 % and 4. 4 %. Higher values (P< 0. 01) in both thyroid hormones were observed in HE and NH than those other treatments. Also, higher values (P< 0. 01) of total protein, albumin, and glucose were observed in HE and NH than other treatments. The control (CTL) group recorded higher concentrations of urea-N and creatinine at different periods of the experiment in comparison with other treatments.

40|$|We provide {{theoretical}} {{tests of}} a novel experimental technique to determine mechanostability of proteins based on stretching a mechanically <b>protected</b> <b>protein</b> by single-molecule force spectroscopy. This technique involves stretching a homogeneous or heterogeneous chain of reference proteins (single-molecule markers) in which one of them acts as host to the guest protein under study. The guest protein is grafted into the host through genetic engineering. It is expected that unraveling of the host precedes the unraveling of the guest removing ambiguities in {{the reading of the}} force-extension patterns of the guest protein. We study examples of such systems within a coarse-grained structure-based model.

In this paper, we studied HSV entry into C 10 murine melanoma cells and identified a third entry pathway for this virus. During entry into C 10 cells, virion envelope glycoproteins rapidly became protected from the membrane-impermeable chemical cross-linker BS 3 and from proteinase K. Protection was gD receptor dependent, and the time taken to detect <b>protected</b> <b>protein</b> was proportional to the rate of virus entry.

Virus entry into C 10 cells was energy dependent, and intracellular enveloped virions were seen within membrane-bound vesicles consistent with endocytic entry. Entry was not inhibited by bafilomycin A 1 or ammonium chloride, showing that passage of the virion through a low-pH environment was not required for infection. Resistance to similar reagents should therefore not be taken as proof of HSV entry by a nonendosomal pathway.

40|$|Due to acute {{shortage}} of quality feeds the majority or ruminants {{have to depend}} mainly on poor quality roughages. Two main drawbacks of such roughages are low ad libitum consumption and poor utilization. In the Sudan hummra is characteristic of the grass dominant in the pasture and as the bulk of animal population in the Sudan {{is in the hands}} of nomads, livestock depend entirely on these grasses, which are low in nitrogen content and are presumably inadequate for meeting the growth requirements of these animals. So limited supplementation experiments were designed to see the effects of supplementation of hummra with molasses, minerals, urea and cotton seed cake (Either separately or together) on its utilization by desert sheep and desert goats and the performance of these animals. Twenty-five young male desert sheep and a similar number of young male desert goats were divided to five groups each, which were matched according to body weight. Group I was fed chopped hummra, group II: chopped hummra + 10 %molasses, Group III: chopped hummra + 10 % molasses + 3 % minerals + vitamins, Group IV: chopped hummra + 10 % molasses + 3 % minerals + vitamins + 2. 7 % urea and Group V fed chopped hummra + 10 % molasses + 3 % minerals + vitamins + 25 % cotton seed cake. Feeding trials were carried out for 6 to 9 weeks. Water was available all the time. The following parameters were used for measuring the extent of utilization of unsupplemented and supplemented desert grass and the effect of supplementation on the performance of desert sheep and desert goats: 1. Feed intake and dry matter digestibility. 2. Nitrogen balance. 3. Growth (Body weight changes) 4. Blood chemical composition. 5. Rumen liquor chemical composition. 6. Dressing percentage. In the light of the above measurements a comparison was made in the efficiency of feed utilization by desert sheep and desert goats. The results obtained are as follows: 1. Feed intake and apparent dry matter digestibility: supplementation with molasses alone or with molasses plus minerals had no significant effect. Supplementation with urea cotton seed cake increased food intake and dry matter digestibility. 2. Feeding hummra alone or hummra plus molasses and mineral mixture, resulted in negative nitrogen balance. Supplementation with urea or cotton seed cake resulted in a positive nitrogen balance which was greater in case of cotton seed cake supplementation than urea supplementation. 3. Growth: In both sheep and goats the group fed grass only and group fed grass plus molasses or molasses and minerals failed to growth or even to maintain body weight. Group IV which received urea supplement managed to maintain its body weight. The only group of sheep and goats which showed positive growth was the group supplemented with <b>protected</b> <b>protein</b> in the form of cotton seed cake. 4. The blood constitutes (total serum protein, albumin, urea, glucose, inorganic phosphorous, magnesium and calcium) were not much affected by the various treatments. The major change occurred in serum urea level, which was significantly higher in groups fed urea and cottonseed cake. 5. Supplementation with cotton seed cake or urea resulted in increased levels of ammonia and total volatile fatty acids in rumen fluid. PH decreased as the levels of total volatile fatty acids increased and showed significant variation. The other rumen liquor components studied (Na, K, osmolarity) showed no significant difference between treatments in both sheep and goats. 6. Supplementation with urea or cotton seed cake resulted in a significant increase in dressing percentage in both sheep and goats but there was no marked difference between feeding hummra alone, hummra plus molasses or molasses plus minerals. The efficiency of utilization of unsupplemented and supplemented desert grass was essentially similar in both sheep and goats. However, supplementation with urea and cotton seed cake was rather more beneficial to goats than sheep. It is concluded from the results of this work than desert grass (hummra) is inadequate for meeting the growth requirements of young desert sheep and desert goats. Supplementation with molasses or molassess and minerals did not improve the utilization of this low-quality roughage. Addition of urea (2. 7 %) to the molasses/minerals supplement improved utilization of desert grass and almost reached the maintenance requirements of both sheep and goats. Supplementation with <b>protected</b> <b>protein</b> in the form of cotton seed cake improved utilization of hummra and resulted in a gain in body weight in both sheep and goats. So it is recommended to use urea as a cheap source of nitrogen supplement for low-quality roughage together with grain or cotton seed cake as a source of <b>protected</b> <b>protein...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Barley grain (Hordeum vulgare L.) is {{characterized}} by a thick fibrous coat, a high level of ß-glucans and simply-arranged starch granules. World production of barley is about 30 % of that of corn. In comparison with corn, barley has more protein, methionine, lysine, cysteine and tryptophan. For ruminants, barley is the third most readily degradable cereal behind oats and wheat. Due to its more rapid starch fermentation rate compared with corn, barley also provides a more synchronous release of energy and nitrogen, thereby improving microbial nutrient assimilation. As a result, feeding barley can reduce the need for feeding <b>protected</b> <b>protein</b> sources. However, this benefit is only realized if rumen acidity is maintained within an optimal range (e. g., > 5. 8 to 6. 0); below this range, microbial maintenance requirements and wastage increase. With a low pH, microbial endotoxines cause pro-inflammatory responses that can weaken immunity and shorten animal longevity. Thus, mismanagement in barley processing and feeding may make a tragedy from this treasure or pearl of cereal grains. Steam-rolling of barley may improve feed efficiency and post-rumen starch digestion. However, it is doubtful if such processing can improve milk production and feed intake. Due to the need to process barley less extensively than other cereals (as long as the pericarp is broken), consistent and global standards for feeding and processing barley could be feasibly established. In high-starch diets, barley feeding reduces the need for capacious small intestinal starch assimilation, subsequently reducing hindgut starch use and fecal nutrient loss. With its nutritional exclusivities underlined, barley use will be a factual art that can either matchlessly profit or harm rumen microbes, cattle production, farm economics and the environment. </p...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that peroxynitrite oxidizes thiol groups through {{competing}} one- and two-electron pathways. The two-electron pathway is mediated by the peroxynitrite anion and prevails quantitatively over the one-electron pathway, which is mediated by peroxynitrous acid or a reactive species derived from it. In CO 2 -containing fluids the oxidation of thiols might follow a different mechanism owing to the rapid formation of a different oxidant, the nitrosoperoxycarbonate anion (ONOOCO 2 (-)). Here we present evidence that in blood plasma peroxynitrite induces the formation of a disulphide cross-linked protein identified by immunological (anti-albumin antibodies) and biochemical criteria (peptide mapping) as a dimer of serum albumin. The albumin dimer did not form in plasma devoid of CO 2 and its formation was enhanced by ascorbate. However, analysis of thiol groups showed that reconstituting dialysed plasma with NaHCO 3 <b>protected</b> <b>protein</b> thiols against the oxidation mediated by peroxynitrite and that the simultaneouspresence of ascorbate provided further protection. Ascorbate alone did not protect thiol groups from peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation. ESR spin-trapping studies with N-t-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN) revealed that peroxynitrite induced the formation of protein thiyl radicals and their intensity was markedly decreased by plasma dialysis and restored by reconstitution with NaHCO 3. PBN completely inhibited the formation of albumin dimer. Moreover, the addition of iron-diethyldithiocarbamate to plasma demonstrated that peroxynitrite induced the formation of protein S-nitrosothiols and/or S-nitrothiols. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that NaHCO 3 favours the one-electron oxidation of thiols by peroxynitrite with formation of thiyl radicals,;NO 2, and RSNOx. Thiyl radicals, in turn, are involved in chain reactions by which thiols are oxidized to disulphides...|$|E

Sponsorship: DEFRA/BBSRC RONO: BBS/E/W/ 00003135 A; BBS/E/W/ 00003135 B; 1920 4063 On file IMPF: 01. 87 This study investigated red clover polyphenol oxidase (PPO), its: activity, activation from latent into active form, and whether grazing {{at different levels}} of herbage maturity could result in sufficient PPO activation to protect proteins and glycerol-based lipid in the rumen. Wild-type red clover with high PPO activity and a mutant red clover with low PPO activity were used in five experiments. Firstly to investigate activation of the latent red clover PPO enzyme either through: protease, substrate (ortho-diphenols), cell damage or chemically (sodium dodecylsulphate detergent) induced mediation. Secondly PPO's activity at a range of pHs were determined to show how activation method altered the enzymes activity. Finally whether grazing could activate latent PPO and ultimately result in <b>protected</b> <b>protein</b> and glycerol-based lipid in the rumen was investigated. Incubation of extracted red clover PPO enzyme with a range of ortho-diphenols in the presence of oxygen resulted in rapid conversion of the latent to the active form of PPO. This conversion was blocked by the addition of ascorbic acid suggesting that this mechanism requires formation of ortho-quinones. Cell damage was highly correlated with activation of latent PPO and the formation of protein-bound phenols due to mixing of the chloroplastic enzyme with the vacuolar substrate (ortho-diphenols). The potential for PPO activity to occur during grazing was investigated by measuring the oxygen concentration in red clover boluses and within the rumen and PPO's effect on protein and glycerol-based lipid within red clover boluses. There was a rapid depletion of oxygen from the rumen, limiting the potential for PPO activation and activity to occur to the period of mastication. PPO was shown to be activated in both wild-type and mutant red clover boluses, however, factors such as fibre content and maturity of the red clover herbage (PPO concentration) altered the efficacy of PPO to produce phenol-bound protein. As a result greater protection of glycerol-based lipid in this study was achieved with a prior conditioning (wilting) of the red clover. Peer reviewe...|$|E

In the first part of this work, the SUPREX technique was used to study the binding interaction between the molecular chaperone Hsp 33 and four different unfolded protein substrates including citrate synthase, lactate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, and aldolase. The results of the studies, which were performed at the intact protein level, suggest that the cooperativity of the Hsp 33 folding/unfolding reaction increases upon binding with denatured protein substrates. This is consistent with the burial of significant hydrophobic surface area in Hsp 33 when it interacts with its substrate proteins. The SUPREX derived Kd-values for Hsp 33 complexes with four different substrates were also found to be all within a range of 3 - 300 nM. The interaction between Hsp 33 and one of its substrates, citrate synthase (CS), was characterized at a higher structural resolution by using the SUPREX technique in combination with a protease digestion protocol. Using this protocol, the thermodynamic properties for both Hsp 33 and CS were evaluated at different stages of binding, including reduced Hsp 33 (inactive form), oxidized Hsp 33 (active form), followed by native CS and finally of Hsp 33 ox -CS complexes before and after reduction with DTT. The results suggest that Hsp 33 binds unfolded proteins that still have a significant amount of residual higher- order structure. Structural rearrangements of the substrate protein appear to occur upon reduction of the Hsp 33 -substrate complexes, which may facilitate the transfer of the substrate protein to other protein folding chaperone systems. In the second part of this dissertation, a mass spectrometry-based covalent labeling protocol, which relies on the amidination rate of globally <b>protected</b> <b>protein</b> amine groups, was designed and applied to the thermodynamic analysis of several eight protein samples including: six purified proteins (ubiquitin, BCAII, RNaseA, 4 OT, and lysozyme with, and without GlcNAc), a five-protein mixture comprised of ubiquitin, BCAII, RNaseA, Cytochome C, and lysozyme, and a yeast cell lysate. The results demonstrate that in ideal cases the folding free energies of proteins and the dissociation constants of protein-ligand complexes can be accurately evaluated using the protocol. Also demonstrated is the new method's compatibility with three different mass spectrometry-based readouts including an intact protein readout using MALDI, a gel-based proteomics readout using MALDI, and an LC-MS-based proteomics readout using isobaric mass tags. The results of the cell lysate sample analysis highlight the complementarity of the labeling protocol to other chemical modification strategies that have been recently developed to make thermodynamic measurements of protein folding and stability on the proteomic scale.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the effects of dietary supplements rich in omega- 3 fatty acid on muscle omega- 3 fatty acid deposition. The consequential effects on growth performance of lambs, colour and lipid oxidative stability of muscle over refrigerated display, and the sensory properties of cooked meat were also examined. A mixture of lucerne chaff : oaten chaff was used as basal diet, offered in different proportions were fed to lambs ad libitum (Expt. 1) or at 90 % ad libitum (Expts. 2 and 3). Such mixtures of roughage diet support slow growth and provide a feed quality pattern similar to late spring to late summer pasture. In Expt. 1, fish meal (7 %), canola meal (8 %) and soymeal (7 %) as natural feed supplements were compared in lambs fed low quality roughage diet. In Expt. 2, fish meal (9 %) and oilseed supplements either in unprotected form (rapeseed - 7 %) or in protected form (ground canola seed - 6 %) were examined in lambs on medium quality roughage diet. Lipids and the proteins in the ground canola seed were treated (RUMENTEK) with aldehyde {{to protect them from}} the rumen microbial activity. Fish meal (9 %), fish oil (1. 5 %), fish oil (1. 5 %) with sunflower meal protein (9 %),' and sunflower meal protein alone (10. 5 %) (a commercial product of a protein supplement from RUMENTEK) were compared in lambs fed medium quality roughage diet in Expt. 3. Long-chain omega- 3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid + docosahexaenoic acid) in muscle longissimus thoracis was increased modestly and markedly with fish meal and fish oil alone or with sunflower meal protein diet, respectively. These long-chain fatty acids were deposited in the muscle structural phospholipid rather than in storage triglycerides. All the diets mentioned above also significantly reduced omega- 6 :omega- 3 fatty acid ratio in meat which is another beneficial effect, as the dietary recommendation in many countries has been to reduce the ratio of omega- 6 :omega- 3 in human diet. Soymeal diet increased modestly both the omega- 3 and omega- 6 fatty acid content of muscle longissimus thoracis resulting in no differences in the omega- 6 :omega- 3 ratio of the meat. A supplement of protected canola seed significantly increased the precursors of omega- 6 (linoleic) and omega- 3 (linolenic) but not the long-chain analogues such as arachidonic acid (omega- 6) and eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic acid (omega- 3), respectively. The marked increase in linoleic acid content was in both triglyceride and phospholipid fractions of muscle longissimus thoracis but the modest increase in linolenic acid content was only in triglyceride fraction of meat. Supplements of canola meal used in Expt. 1, unprotected rapeseed used in Expt. 2 and protected sunflower meal protein used in Expt. 3 did not alter the fatty acid composition of muscle longissimus thoracis compared with lambs fed the control diet in that particular experiment. The increased level of long-chain omega- 3 fatty acid and/or omega- 6 fatty acid with the lipid supplements discussed above did not significantly affect the meat colour stability and lipid oxidative stability of fresh and vacuum packaged meat over the storage at refrigerated display. This suggests that the conditions under which the animals are grown (grazing vs grain fed or feedlot) and the species of animal are important in determining the oxidative stabilities of meat by altering the levels of muscle vitamin E concentrations at slaughter. The level of inclusion of lucerne chaff in the basal diet {{is an important factor in}} improving the redness of meat indicated by the a*-value; a higher level of lucerne chaff intake is more likely to be associated with increased intake of vitamin E. Thus colour and lipid oxidative stabilities of meat can be improved in red meat animals that are on poor quality diets by the inclusion of lucerne chaff in their diet. The sensory properties of cooked meat evaluated in the present study were not affected by the significant increase in muscle long-chain omega- 3 fatty acid or omega- 6 fatty acid content with fish oil and protected canola seed supplements, respectively. Addition of protected sunflower meal as a protein supplement together with fish oil significantly lowered the ratings of flavour and overall acceptability of meat compared with the control lambs. The results demonstrate that the common `lamby' and `muttony' flavour and aroma attributes were not hidden by any of the dietary treatments. These two characters associated with the species flavour and aroma were recognised by the panellists as a distinct attribute. Dry matter intake was not adversely affected by any of the lipid supplements used in the present study. Feed conversion efficiency was highest with fish meal diet on both low and medium quality roughage diets. At medium quality roughage-based diet, Feed conversion efficiency was modestly improved by protected canola seed diet but other supplements providing either natural (unprotected rapeseed) or <b>protected</b> <b>protein</b> (protected sunflower meal) did not support significant differences compared with basal diet. The significant increase in liveweight gain with fish meal diet reflected a significant increase in hot carcass weight compared with all other supplemented lambs either on low or on medium quality roughage diet. Protected lipid and protein offered by protected canola seed diet significantly and moderately increased liveweight gain and hot carcass weight from control diet but not different from unprotected rapeseed diet. The greatest muscle deposition was with the fish meal diet and is attributed mainly to the increased amount of protein and energy absorbed from the small intestine of those lambs. In addition to energy and protein absorption, the alteration of omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in muscle membranes may have a further influence in lean meat production. In terms of carcass gain and intramuscular fat deposition of fishmeal and fish oil fed lambs, the results also lead to a hypothesis that modifying omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid of muscle membrane phospholipids may have an influence in improved muscle deposition in lambs by improving the insulin action at skeletal muscle site.
