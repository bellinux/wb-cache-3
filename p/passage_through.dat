5|$|Although it has {{not been}} shown {{experimentally}} if the spores can survive the <b>passage</b> <b>through</b> an animal's digestive tract, the regular presence of Cyathus on cow or horse manure strongly suggest that this is true. Alternatively, the hard outer casing of peridioles ejected from splash cups may simply disintegrate over time, eventually releasing the spores within.|$|E

5|$|During ancient times, Gibraltar was {{regarded}} by {{the peoples of}} the Mediterranean as a place of religious and symbolic importance. The Phoenicians were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as a shrine to the genius loci of the place, as did the Carthaginians and Romans after them. Excavations in the cave have shown that pottery, jewellery and Egyptian scarabs were left as offerings to the gods, probably in the hope of securing safe <b>passage</b> <b>through</b> the dangerous waters of the Strait of Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|During {{sunrise and}} sunset, {{sunlight}} is attenuated because of Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering from a particularly long <b>passage</b> <b>through</b> Earth's atmosphere, and the Sun is sometimes faint {{enough to be}} viewed comfortably {{with the naked eye}} or safely with optics (provided there is no risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing through a break between clouds). Hazy conditions, atmospheric dust, and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric attenuation.|$|E

5|$|Hydrogen {{is highly}} soluble in many rare earth and {{transition}} metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals.

40|$|AbstractThe {{article is}} devoted to the {{problems}} of making cargo <b>passages</b> <b>through</b> low-head waterpower developments (those built in XX century in Central Russia). The paper presents an analysis of layout and structural properties of these <b>passages</b> which go <b>through</b> phreatic and concrete dams and through river-run power plants. The paper stresses the importance of these cargo passages for transport connection both at the time when hydraulic engineering structures were being built and nowadays. The research also points out the problems in cargo passages operation and explains why these problems occur. Motor highways through the biggest hydroelectric power stations of the Volga are taken as an example. The author offers some efficient technical solutions for making cargo <b>passages</b> <b>through</b> lowland rivers more effective...|$|R

5|$|About 90% of the sungrazers {{observed}} with SOHO {{are members of}} the Kreutz group, which all originate from one giant comet that broke up into many smaller comets during its first <b>passage</b> <b>through</b> the inner Solar System. The remainder contains some sporadic sungrazers, but four other related groups of comets have been identified among them: the Kracht, Kracht 2a, Marsden, and Meyer groups. The Marsden and Kracht groups both appear to be related to Comet 96P/Machholz, which is also the parent of two meteor streams, the Quadrantids and the Arietids.|$|E
5|$|Although Portuguese by birth, Ferdinand Magellan {{transferred}} his {{allegiance to}} King Charles I of Spain, on whose behalf he left Seville on 10 August 1519, with {{a squadron of}} five ships, {{in search of a}} western route to the Spice Islands in the East Indies. Success depended on finding a strait or <b>passage</b> <b>through</b> the South American land masses, or finding the southern tip of the continent and sailing around it. The South American coast was sighted on 6 December 1519, and Magellan moved cautiously southward, following the coast to reach latitude 49°S on 31 March 1520. Little if anything was known of the coast south of this point, so Magellan decided to wait out the southern winter here, and established the settlement of Puerto San Julian.|$|E
