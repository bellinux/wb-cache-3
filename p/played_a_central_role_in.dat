5|$|A {{more serious}} fictional {{portrayal}} of McCarthy <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the 1959 novel The Manchurian Candidate by Richard Condon. The character of Senator John Iselin, a demagogic anti-communist, is closely modeled on McCarthy, {{even to the}} varying numbers of Communists he asserts are employed by the federal government. He remains a major character in the 1962 film version.|$|E

5|$|Clements {{was elected}} to the Kentucky Senate in 1941, {{representing}} Union, Webster, and Henderson counties. By 1944, he had risen to the post of majority leader in that body and <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> writing the state's budget that year. Due to Clements' efforts, educational appropriations were increased far above what had been called for by Republican governor Simeon Willis.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the ships}} were poorly armored {{compared}} to foreign designs in general, the ships' underwater protection {{was the greatest}} weakness in the armor scheme. The torpedo bulkhead was placed {{too close to the}} outer hull, which reduced its ability to absorb damage. This weakness <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the loss of both Espa√±a to grounding in 1923 and the sinking of Alfonso XIII by a single mine in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are an {{important}} natural means of transferring genes between different species, which increases genetic diversity and drives evolution.

5|$|Between April 1947 and December 1948, when George C. Marshall was Secretary of State, Kennan {{was more}} {{influential}} {{than he was}} at any other period in his career. Marshall valued his strategic sense and had him create and direct what is now named the Policy Planning Staff, the State Department's internal think tank. Kennan became the first Director of Policy Planning. Marshall relied heavily on him to prepare policy recommendations. Kennan <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the drafting of the Marshall Plan.|$|E

Friend, a faculty member in Princeton's Department of Art and Archaeology, <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> planning the iconography. It was built by Matthews Construction Company, which worked on several projects on Princeton's campus. Among those who contributed to the design of stained glass windows were Charles Connick, Henry Lee Willet (of the studio that would become Willet Hauser), and Philadelphia-based stained glass artist Nicola d'Ascenzo.|$|E
5|$|Education of {{the young}} was never {{considered}} to be the primary domain of schools, even after they had become more common. Most education was carried out by a child's parents or foster parents. Formal apprenticeships were not the norm in Plymouth; it was expected that a foster family would teach the children whatever trades they themselves practiced. The church also <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> a child's education. As noted above, the primary purpose of teaching children to read was so that they could read the Bible for themselves.|$|E

5|$|In the 1940s, Harold Innis {{reached the}} height of his {{influence}} in both academic circles and Canadian society. In 1941, he helped establish the American-based Economic History Association and its Journal of Economic History. He later became the association's second president. Innis <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> founding two important sources for the funding of academic research: the Canadian Social Science Research Council (1940) and the Humanities Research Council of Canada (1944).|$|E

MIT alumnus and faculty member George Ellery Hale <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the development of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and other faculty members have been key founders of Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in nearby Needham, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Between 1822 and 1848 Bute <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the {{creation}} of the Cardiff Docks. The idea was first put forward to Bute by one of his staff in 1822, who suggested that, with the right investment, Cardiff could be transformed into a major port for exporting coal and iron. The existing seaport, used by the Glamorganshire Canal, was small and inefficient. The new port would then deliver a direct return to Bute from shipping rates, improve the value of his lands in Cardiff itself and increase the value of the royalties he could charge on his coal fields. Initially Bute opposed plans for docks put forward by the local ironmasters, but then changed his mind and pushed forward with his own scheme shortly afterward.|$|E

5|$|Located {{near the}} Principality's capital of Andravida {{and the chief}} port of Glarentza, Chlemoutsi <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the Principality's history, but was never {{actually}} besieged. After coming under Byzantine rule in 1427, it was captured in 1460 by the Ottoman Empire, {{along with the rest}} of the Byzantine Despotate of the Morea. In Ottoman times, minor additions were made to provide platforms for artillery, but the castle progressively lost its significance and was completely deserted by the late 18th century. In 1825, during the Greek War of Independence, part of its outer wall was demolished to prevent the Greek rebels from using it. Today it is a preserved monument open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Many pre-Columbian Native American {{societies}} of ancient North America built large pyramidal earth structures known as platform mounds. Among {{the largest and}} best-known of these structures is Monks Mound {{at the site of}} Cahokia in what became Illinois, completed around 1100 AD, which has a base larger than that of the Great Pyramid at Giza. Many of the mounds underwent multiple episodes of mound construction at periodic intervals, some becoming quite large. They are believed to have <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the mound-building peoples' religious life and documented uses include semi-public chief's house platforms, public temple platforms, mortuary platforms, charnel house platforms, earth lodge/town house platforms, residence platforms, square ground and rotunda platforms, and dance platforms.|$|E
5|$|Night market: The {{concept of}} the night market traces its roots back to the medieval Chinese Tang dynasty. The Tang {{government}} put strict sanctions on night markets and their operations in A.D. 836. Towards {{the end of the}} Tang Dynasty, economic expansion led to less state regulation and restrictions being lifted on night markets. During the Song Dynasty (960-1279), Night markets <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> medieval Chinese nightlife. These markets were found in corners of large cities. Some stayed open for twenty- four hours. Song period night markets are also known to have included restaurants and brothels due to being frequently located near business and red light districts.|$|E

5|$|Palmer {{traveled}} to the Oregon Country in 1845. He <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> blazing {{the last leg of}} the Oregon Trail, the Barlow Road, with Sam Barlow and others. Specifically, Palmer is noted for having climbed high on Mount Hood to observe the surrounding area when the party ran into difficulty. He wrote a popular immigrant guidebook, co-founded Dayton, Oregon, and served as a controversial Indian Affairs administrator. After Oregon became a state, Palmer served in both branches of the Oregon Legislative Assembly. He was selected as Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives for one session in 1862, and in 1870 lost a bid to become Governor of Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Rumours {{of affairs}} did not {{surround}} only Bigge. In 1890, the sculptor Joseph Edgar Boehm died in Louise's presence at his studio in London, leading to rumours {{that the two}} were having an affair. Boehm's assistant, Alfred Gilbert, who <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> comforting Louise after Boehm's death, and supervised the destruction of Boehm's private papers, was rapidly promoted as a royal sculptor. Louise was also romantically linked to fellow artist Edwin Lutyens; her equerry, Colonel William Probert; and an unnamed music master. However, Jehanne Wake, Louise's biographer, argues {{that there is no}} substantial evidence to suggest that Louise had sexual relationships with anyone other than her husband.|$|E
5|$|Taiko have a mythological {{origin in}} Japanese folklore, but {{historical}} records suggest that taiko {{were introduced to}} Japan through Korean and Chinese cultural influence {{as early as the}} 6th century CE. Some taiko are similar to instruments originating from India. Archaeological evidence also supports that taiko were present in Japan during the 6th century in the Kofun period. Their function has varied through history, ranging from communication, military action, theatrical accompaniment, and religious ceremony to both festival and concert performances. In modern times, taiko have also <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> social movements for minorities both within and outside Japan.|$|E
