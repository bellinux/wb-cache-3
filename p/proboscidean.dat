5|$|Over 185 extinct {{members and}} three major {{evolutionary}} radiations {{of the order}} Proboscidea have been recorded. The earliest proboscids, the African Eritherium and Phosphatherium of the late Paleocene, heralded the first radiation. The Eocene included Numidotherium, Moeritherium, and Barytherium from Africa. These animals were relatively small and aquatic. Later on, genera such as Phiomia and Palaeomastodon arose; the latter likely inhabited forests and open woodlands. <b>Proboscidean</b> diversity declined during the Oligocene. One notable species of this epoch was Eritreum melakeghebrekristosi of the Horn of Africa, {{which may have been}} an ancestor to several later species. The beginning of the Miocene saw the second diversification, with the appearance of the deinotheres and the mammutids. The former were related to Barytherium and lived in Africa and Eurasia, while the latter may have descended from Eritreum and spread to North America.|$|E
25|$|To {{explain the}} small stature of H.nbsp&floresiensis, Brown et al. have {{suggested}} that in the limited food environment on Flores, H.nbsp&erectus evolved a smaller body size via insular dwarfism, a form of speciation which has been observed in other species on Flores alsonbsp&– including several species of the <b>proboscidean</b> genus Stegodon, an elephant-like creature. (A dwarf stegodont species of Flores, Stegodon sondaari, became extinct by about 850,000 years ago {{and was replaced by}} another species of normal size, Stegodon florensis, which then also evolved into a dwarf form, Stegodon florensis insularis, which disappeared about 12,000 years ago.) This hypothesis has been criticized by Teuku Jacob and colleagues who argue that LB1 is similar to the pygmy peoples who populate a Flores village, Rampasasa,nbsp&– and who point out that size can vary substantially in pygmy populations. Contradictory evidence has emerged.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Pleistocene, elephantids experienced a high rate of speciation. The Pleistocene also saw the arrival of Palaeoloxodon namadicus, the largest terrestrial mammal of all time. Loxodonta atlantica became the most common species in northern and southern Africa but was replaced by Elephas iolensis later in the Pleistocene. Only when Elephas disappeared from Africa did Loxodonta become dominant once again, this time {{in the form of the}} modern species. Elephas diversified into new species in Asia, such as E.hysudricus and E.platycephus; the latter the likely ancestor of the modern Asian elephant. Mammuthus evolved into several species, including the well-known woolly mammoth. In the Late Pleistocene, most <b>proboscidean</b> species vanished during the Quaternary glaciation which killed off 50% of genera weighing over [...] worldwide.|$|E

500|$|The second {{radiation}} {{was represented}} {{by the emergence of}} the gomphotheres in the Miocene, which likely evolved from Eritreum and originated in Africa, spreading to every continent except Australia and Antarctica. Members of this group included Gomphotherium and [...] Platybelodon. The third radiation started in the late Miocene and led to the arrival of the elephantids, which descended from, and slowly replaced, the gomphotheres. The African Primelephas gomphotheroides gave rise to Loxodonta, Mammuthus, and Elephas. Loxodonta branched off earliest around the Miocene and Pliocene boundary while Mammuthus and Elephas diverged later during the early Pliocene. Loxodonta remained in Africa while Mammuthus and Elephas spread to Eurasia, and the former reached North America. At the same time, the stegodontids, another <b>proboscidean</b> group descended from gomphotheres, spread throughout Asia, including the Indian subcontinent, China, southeast Asia, and Japan. Mammutids continued to evolve into new species, such as the American mastodon.|$|E
500|$|Paraceratherium {{is one of}} {{the largest}} known land mammals that have ever existed, but its exact size is unclear because of the lack of {{complete}} specimens. Early estimates of [...] are now considered exaggerated; it may have been in the range of [...] at maximum, and as low as [...] on average. Calculations have mainly been based on fossils of P. transouralicum because this species is known from the most complete remains. Estimates have been based on skull, teeth, and limb bone measurements, but the known bone elements are represented by individuals of different sizes, so all skeletal reconstructions are composite extrapolations, resulting in several weight ranges. Its total body length was estimated as [...] from front to back by Granger and Gregory in 1936, and [...] by Vera Gromova in 1959, but the former estimate is now considered exaggerated. The weight of Paraceratherium was similar to that of some extinct proboscideans, with the largest complete skeleton known belonging to the steppe mammoth (Mammuthus trogontherii). In spite of the roughly equivalent mass, Paraceratherium may have been taller than any <b>proboscidean.</b> Its shoulder height was estimated as [...] at the shoulders by Granger and Gregory, but [...] by Gregory S. Paul in 1997. The neck was estimated at [...] long by Michael P. Taylor and Mathew J. Wedel in 2013. The teeth of P. orgosensis (from which that species is mainly known) are 25 percent larger than those of P. transouralicum, making it the largest known indricothere.|$|E

60|$|For example, {{there is}} our friend the mammoth. I suppose no animal is more {{frequently}} {{present to the}} mind of the non-geological speaker, when he talks indefinitely about the great extinct monsters, than the familiar figure of that huge-tusked, hairy northern elephant. Yet the mammoth, chronologically speaking, is but a thing of yesterday. He was hunted here in England by men whose descendants are probably still living--at least so Professor Boyd Dawkins solemnly assures us; while in Siberia his frozen body, flesh and all, is found so very fresh that the wolves devour it, without raising any unnecessary question as to its fitness for lupine food. The Glacial Epoch is the yesterday of geological time, and it was the Glacial Epoch that finally killed off the last mammoth. Then, again, there is his neighbour, the mastodon. That big tertiary <b>proboscidean</b> did not live quite long enough, it is true, to be hunted by the cavemen of the Pleistocene age, but he survived at any rate as long as the Pliocene--our day before yesterday--and he often fell very likely before the fire-split flint weapons of the Abbé Bourgeois' Miocene men. The period that separates him from our own day is as nothing compared with the vast and immeasurable interval that separates him from the huge marine saurians of the Jurassic world. To compare the relative lapses of time with human chronology, the mastodon stands to our own fauna as Beau Brummel stands to the modern masher, while the saurians stand to it as the Egyptian and Assyrian warriors stand to Lord Wolseley and the followers of the Mahdi.|$|E
