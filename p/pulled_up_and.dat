5|$|After McCoy {{told them}} they were the Miami Showband, Thomas Crozier (who had a notebook) asked the band members for their names and addresses, while the others bantered with them about {{the success of their}} {{performance}} that night. As Crozier took down the information, a car <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> another uniformed man appeared on the scene. He wore a uniform and beret noticeably different from the others. He spoke with an educated English accent and immediately took charge, ordering a man who appeared to have been the leader of the patrol, to tell Crozier to obtain their names and dates of birth instead of addresses.|$|E
5|$|Strict Jains don't eat root {{vegetables}} such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers. This is so because tiny life forms are injured when {{the plant is}} <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> because the bulb {{is seen as a}} living being, as it is able to sprout. Also, consumption of most {{root vegetables}} involves uprooting and killing the entire plant, in contrast to consumption of most other terrestrial vegetables, upon which the plant lives on after plucking the vegetables (or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Mushrooms, fungi and yeasts are forbidden because they are parasites, grow in non-hygienic environments, and may harbour other life forms. Alfalfa is the only known plant that contains vitamin D2, which they may use directly or make vitamin D2 supplements from. Honey is forbidden, as its collection would amount to violence against the bees.|$|E
40|$|Upper {{extremity}} (UE) pressing {{and pulling}} strength are vital {{for success in}} many sports. Therefore, testing UE strength is considered an integral component of a complete athletic testing profile. Although open kinetic chain (OKC) UE strength tests and associated protocols are common, closed kinetic chain (CKC) UE tests are less so. Hence it is worthwhile to examine {{the utility of the}} <b>Pull</b> <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> Dip as CKC measures of UE maximal strength. A group of 15 adult males of mixed level (recreational to international) athletes performed a 1 RM maximum <b>Pull</b> <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> Dip test on 2 occasions separated by 7 days. Distinct anatomical markers and movement standards were identified to assist with the evaluation of the subjects’ performance. From the trials, the test-retest reliability, smallest worthwhile change and ratio between the <b>Pull</b> <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> Dip were examined. These <b>Pull</b> <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> Dips were measured in both absolute (105. 90 ± 17. 78, and 116. 89 ± 23. 48, respectively) and relative to body weight (1. 43 ± 0. 15, and 1. 59 ± 0. 23, respectively). Both tests demonstrate high reliability (ICC 0. 96 - 0. 99) and determined a smallest worthwhile change of 3 % in relative <b>Pull</b> <b>Up</b> strength <b>and</b> 4 % in relative Dip strength; respectively. When taking into account relative strength, the upper body musculature used for the Dip movement is 1. 11 times stronger than the musculature involved in <b>Pull</b> <b>Up.</b> Strength <b>and</b> conditioning coaches can use these protocols to examine possible differences between higher and lower performers and correlations with performance measures in a sport...|$|R

5|$|With {{the loss}} of Bucher and his aircraft, the C-130 Hercules had not {{completed}} a successful evacuation, and {{there were more than}} 600 people still on the ground. Next in line was Lieutenant Colonel William Boyd; he was flying an airlift mission into Chu Lai, until he was diverted into Khâm Đức to extract forces and civilians there. Just before Boyd touched down, an artillery shell exploded about 100 feet in front of his aircraft, so he was forced to pull the throttle forward. Boyd then <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> went around for a second approach, because he could see the desperation {{of the people on the}} ground. As he landed, hundreds of civilians and soldiers poured out of the ditches and rushed onto the aircraft. Because he had witnessed the destruction of Bucher's C-130 while taking off in the north direction, Boyd decided to fly out from the southwest. After Boyd's aircraft was airborne, he banked the aircraft so it would be masked by the rolling terrain. The aircraft sustained damages to the left wing, the fuselage, and the leading edge of both wings, but it landed safely in Chu Lai with all the passengers.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{intensified}} to EF4 {{strength as}} it entered Van Buren County and tore {{through the south}} edge of Clinton, killing three people in the vicinity. One of these deaths occurred at a boat manufacturing plant in town which was destroyed. The plant was completely leveled to the ground, with its metal beam frame severely mangled. Homes in this area were leveled and swept from their foundations, vehicles were wrapped around trees and rendered nearly unrecognizable, a dentists office was obliterated, and trees were debarked. A church and several businesses were damaged as well. 62 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 30 were severely damaged, and 31 sustained minor damage. The tornado maintained EF4 intensity as it continued into Stone County, slamming into the town of Mountain View. The local hospital sustained heavy roof and wall damage, and several doctors offices were destroyed, along with a paint shop, a body shop, and a car parts store. A car dealership was completely flattened, with vehicles being tossed from the sales lot and across the highway. One vehicle was lofted a considerable distance {{through the air and}} over a building before being dropped into a ravine. Surveyors observed a utility pole in this area that was <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> jammed back into the ground with wires still attached. The town's fire station was heavily damaged, and one fatality occurred when a house was swept from its foundation. 38 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 15 sustained major damage, and 15 sustained minor damage in the Mountain View area. The tornado weakened slightly to high-end EF3 strength as it crossed into Izard County and impacted the rural community of Zion, killing two people, destroying 43 homes and mobile homes, severely damaging 14, and lightly damaging 36 more. Hundreds of cattle were killed in this area, and a Jeep was stripped down to its frame and tires and found wrapped around the stump of a large tree that was snapped. An unanchored home in the area was swept clean from its foundation as well, leaving only the slab behind. Maintaining EF3 intensity, the tornado then struck the town of Highland in Sharp County, resulting in severe damage. At least 40 businesses along U.S. Route 412 in Highland were damaged or destroyed, including a strip mall, a restaurant, a church, and a car dealership. The local fire station was destroyed along with much of the equipment inside, and multiple vehicles were overturned along the highway. 40 homes and mobile homes were destroyed, 8 sustained major damage, and 19 sustained minor damage in the Highland area. Highland High School and two apartment buildings sustained minor damage as well. To the northeast of Highland, the tornado rapidly weakened and dissipated.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{cause of}} the riot has been disputed – some sources {{indicate}} it was caused by an unprovoked baton charge by the police, while others indicate that strikers attempted to stop trams traveling through the square. Pitched battles took place between police and strikers in the streets around the square. Iron palings were <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> used as a defence against the police truncheons, while bottles were mobilised from a passing lorry to serve as missiles. The police's efforts to disperse the crowd from the Square were unsuccessful. Eventually there was a re-grouping and the workers began to move off from George Square to march towards Glasgow Green. Police were again unsuccessful {{in their attempts to}} disperse the strikers.|$|E
25|$|The {{conception}} of Vicki Fowler in 1985 {{was one of}} the first controversial storylines featured in EastEnders since its inception that February, as it involved the pregnancy of a schoolgirl, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). Exploiting a whodunnit angle, viewers were not initially told who was the father, and press interest in the fledgling show escalated as journalists attempted to guess. The audience finally discovered his identity in October 1985 on episode 66. Written by series co-creator/script-editor Tony Holland and directed by co-creator/producer Julia Smith, it was considered a landmark episode in the show's history. Four possible suspects were seen leaving the Square early in the episode: Tony Carpenter (Oscar James), Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson), and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). As Michelle waited by their rendezvous point, a car <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> the fluffy white legs of the soap landlord's poodle Roly leapt out of a car and gave it all away: Den Watts had fathered Michelle's baby. After this storyline the programme started to appear in newspaper cartoons as it moved more and more into the public mainstream.|$|E

25|$|Collapsible Boat A {{reached the}} deck {{the right way}} up and was being {{attached}} to the falls by Murdoch and Moody when it was washed off Titanic at 2:15a.m. In the chaos, the canvas sides were not <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> the boat drifted away from the ship partially submerged and dangerously overloaded. Many of the occupants climbed in from the water but many (at least seven or eight, including the first class passenger Thomson Beattie, the third class passengers Arthur Keefe, Edvard Lindell and Gerda Lindell, {{and a couple of}} firemen) died of hypothermia or fell back into the sea. By the time the survivors were transferred into Collapsible Boat D, only about 12 or 13 people were left alive, Rhoda Abbott, who had lost her two young sons in the water, being the only female. Three bodies, including that of Mr. Beattie, were left in Collapsible A, which was allowed to drift off; they were not recovered until a month later, by , another White Star Line ship.|$|E
25|$|Gosala is {{described}} in ancient texts as a contemporary of Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, and of Gautama Buddha. The Jain Bhagavati Sutra refers to him as Gosala Mankhaliputta ("son of Mankhali"). The text depicts Gosala as having been a disciple of Mahavira's {{for a period of}} six years, after which the two had a falling out and parted ways. According to the Bhagvati Sutra, Makkhali Gosala met with Mahāvīra again later in life, but Gosala asserted to Mahavira that he was not the same person. Makkhali Gosala referred to the example of a sesame plant which “had been <b>pulled</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> had temporarily died, but it had been replanted and thus reanimated, becoming once more living, while the seven pods had developed”. Gosāla declared that the original Gosāla who was Mahavira's companion once was dead, and that the soul now inhabiting the apparent Gosāla in front of him was a reanimated, completely different Gosala. This argument was declared a form of sophistry by Mahavira, and this led to a significant break in the relations between the two.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} {{meeting of the}} 2011 IAAF Diamond League at Shanghai Golden Grand Prix, Powell won the 100m {{with a time of}} 9.95 seconds. Powell next ran at the IAAF Diamond League in Rome against Usain Bolt on 26 May. Powell had a superb start and mid but he faded towards the end, only to allow the world record holder to surpass him in the final 10–12m of the race. Bolt won in 9.91s and Powell came second in 9.93s. He said that he had lost focus, but is {{confident}} about beating Usain after what he had done that day. Powell next competed in the IAAF World Challenge in Rabat, Morocco, in a low key meet. There, after running the first 20m, he <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> finished last in 36.13s, citing a precaution against a serious hamstring injury. Reports said that it was nothing serious and he would be ready for the Jamaican Trials later in the month. At the Jamaican Trials 23–24 July, Powell looked impressive as he qualified through the rounds. He posted a season best of 9.90s in his semi-final, despite easing off in the final 15m. Later, after overcoming a bad start, Powell won the final to be titled National Champion for the fifth time in his career. He won in a time of 10.08s into a 1.8m/s headwind. Yohan Blake and Steve Mullings were second and third respectively with 0.01s separating them.|$|E

25|$|Vercingetorix {{sent the}} cavalry around Gaul {{to call the}} Gallic tribes to war and come to Alesia. When Caesar heard of this from deserters and captives, he dug a trench twenty feet deep (6 metres, 19ft.) with {{perpendicular}} sides, built all other works four hundred feet (118 m, 388ft.) away from that trench and in between he dug two trenches fifteen feet (4.4 m,14.5ft.) in length and depth. The inner one was filled with water from the rivers. Behind them he built a twelve feet high (3.5 m, 11.6ft.) rampart and wall with a parapet and large stakes projecting from the joint between the parapet and the battlement to prevent the enemy from scaling it. This was surrounded with turrets eighty feet apart (23.7 m, 77.7ft.). The stakes for the palisade were sharpened to a point, sunk into a five-feet deep trench (1.5m, 4.85ft.), fastened at the bottom {{so that they could}} not be <b>pulled</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> placed in five intersected rows. Eight rows, three feet apart (0.89 m, 2.9ft.), of conic pits which were three feet deep were dug in oblique rows {{in the form of a}} quincunx (an arrangement of five objects with four at the corners the fifth at the centre) in front of the palisade.They were called 'cippi.' Stakes sharpened at the top and hardened with fire, the thickness of a man’s thigh, were sunk in the pits and protruded four inches (0.1 m, 3.9 inches) from the ground. The pits were filled with clay and covered over with twigs. One-foot-long stakes (0.3 m) with iron hooks were sunk at small intervals in front of the pits. To prepare for the arrival of the Gallic relief forces he constructed an outer fortification, a contravallation, with the same specifications as protection against external attack by the Gallic relief force. The besiegers were preparing to be besieged.|$|E
