40|$|U. S. firms {{commonly}} use <b>preferred</b> <b>stocks</b> {{to raise}} external capital. Yet this hybrid security's issuance costs and offer yields {{have not been}} previously examined in a systematic manner. We analyze a sample of 3, 042 U.

Scale, credit rating, and industry effects influence gross spreads and issuance costs. We also compare <b>preferred</b> <b>stocks</b> yields with various bellwether bond yields.

25|$|At {{the peak}} of the {{financial}} crisis in September 2008, Berkshire invested $5 billion in <b>preferred</b> <b>stock</b> in Goldman Sachs to provide it with a source of funding when capital markets had become constrained.
