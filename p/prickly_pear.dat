5|$|<b>Prickly</b> <b>pear</b> cacti were {{introduced}} into Queensland, Australia as ornamental plants, starting in 1788. They quickly spread to cover over 25 million hectares of Australia by 1920, increasing by 1 million hectares per year. Digging, burning and crushing all proved ineffective. Two control agents {{were introduced}} to help control {{the spread of the}} plant, the cactus moth Cactoblastis cactorum, and the scale insect Dactylopius. Between 1926 and 1931, tens of millions of cactus moth eggs were distributed around Queensland with great success, and by 1932, most areas of <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> had been destroyed.|$|E

40|$|In the world, Mexico is {{the major}} {{producer}} of <b>prickly</b> <b>pears</b> and also has the largest number in varieties. However, {{in addition to its}} highly seasonal production, <b>prickly</b> <b>pears</b> are consumed just by a small segment of the Mexican population. Therefore, the promotion of <b>prickly</b> <b>pears</b> consumption in the form of new derivative products by emphasizing its bioactive properties seems to be a possible solution to its low consumption. Recent studies from European and Asian laboratories showed that some <b>prickly</b> <b>pears</b> varieties have a significant antioxidant activity. In Mexico, <b>prickly</b> <b>pears</b> producers are looking for new ways of commercialization. In this regard, similar studies are underway surveying those varieties from the highly producing Mexican states with the goal to develop new functional products with high added value. In addition, the use of <b>prickly</b> <b>pears</b> as a raw material for the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries is being considered and seems to be highly promising. <b>Prickly</b> <b>pears,</b> antioxidant activity, innovation, functional food., Agribusiness,...|$|R

5|$|The curve-billed thrasher is an omnivore. Its diet {{includes}} invertebrates such as beetles, moths, butterflies, arachnids, and snails.

The curve-billed {{has also been}} spotted eating dog food, and will feed it to their chicks.|$|E
5|$|While French {{innovations}} enriched {{the cuisine}} in many ways, not every innovation was favorable. Since the French {{introduction of the}} <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> cactus in the 18thcentury, the lifestyle of southern pastoralists became increasingly reliant on the plant to ensure food and water for their zebu as well as fruit and water for themselves {{during the dry season}} between July and December. However, in 1925, a French colonist wishing to eradicate the cactus on his property in the southwestern town of Toliara introduced the cochineal, an insect known to be a parasite of the plant. Within five years, nearly all the <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> cactus of southern Madagascar had been completely wiped out, sparking a massive famine from 1930–1931. Although these ethnic groups have since adapted in various ways, the famine period is commonly remembered as the time when their traditional lifestyle was ended by the arrival of foreigners on their land.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} {{been implicated in}} the spread of weeds by {{consuming}} and dispersing fruit and seed. In {{the first half of}} the twentieth century, pied currawongs were shot as they were considered pests of corn and strawberry crops, as well as assisting in the spread of the <b>prickly</b> <b>pear.</b> They were also shot on Lord Howe Island for attacking chickens. However, they are seen as beneficial in forestry as they consume phasmids, and also in agriculture for eating cocoons of the codling moth.|$|E

5|$|The curve-billed {{breeding}} season begins in February and reaches an apex between March and May; however, new fledglings {{have been recorded}} as late as August. Dates vary within its range due to temperature and rainfall. Nests are generally built at conspicuous locations, the cholla being favored. Other potential nesting sites range from mesquite, <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> or yucca to the occasional oak and pine trees. The nest is generally a deep cup but can be flat with a depression for the eggs. The outer layer consists of thorny twigs while the inner layer includes smooth sticks, roots, coarse and fine grasses, rootlets or hair.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{supplemented}} {{their diet}} by gathering {{the seeds and}} fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. Depending on the season, they collected piñon nuts and juniper berries, weedy goosefoot, pigweed, purslane, tomatillo, tansy mustard, globe mallow, sunflower seeds, and yucca, as well as various species of grass and cacti. <b>Prickly</b> <b>pear</b> fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used sagebrush and mountain mahogany, along with piñon and juniper, for firewood. They also smoked wild tobacco. Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred, their midden piles were viewed with reverence. Starting during the Basketmaker III period, , Mesa Verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Palestine the wet {{season was}} approaching with another thunderstorm and heavy {{rain on the}} night of 11 November. The dark cotton soil over which the Egyptian Expeditionary Force was now advancing would not need much more rain to turn it into impassable mud. But 12 November had been fine and the roads had dried out. The rolling maritime plain was dotted with villages on low hill tops surrounded by groves and orchards. These were in turn surrounded by hedges of <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> or cactus, making them strong natural places of defence. In the distance to the right the spurs and valleys of the Judean Hills were visible even to the invading British Empire troops near the Mediterranean coast. On 13 November the weather was clear and fine with at first no sign of the Ottoman Army.|$|E

25|$|O. ficus-indica is {{sensitive}} to lack of oxygen in the root zone, requiring well-drained soils. Opuntia ficus-indica is similar to CAM species which are not salt-tolerant in their root zone where growth may cease under high salt concentration.

O. ficus-indica is absent in regions where there is less than 40% humidity {{for more than a}} month. Mean daily temperature required to develop is at least 1.5-2°C.
