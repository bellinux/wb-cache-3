25|$|The Benton Visual Retention Test is an {{assessment}} of visual perception, and visual memory abilities. More than 50 years of proven clinical use is the staple of the Benton Visual Retention Test. This test has proven its sensitivity to reading disabilities, nonverbal learning disabilities, traumatic brain injury, attention-deficit disorder, alzheimer's, {{and other forms of}} dementia. During testing participants are presented with 10 cards for 10 seconds with unique designs on each. After the time has passed participants are asked to immediately reproduce the designs from each card using their visual memory. In the second stage participants are asked to copy each of the 10 card designs while the cards are in view. The participants results from each task are then assessed and placed into six categories; omissions, distortions, preservations, rotations, misplacements, and sizing errors. The further the participant’s scores varies from the averages provided in the Benton Visual Retention Test manual the worse the participant is assessed to be on visual memory ability. The Benton Visual Retention Test {{has proved to be a}} generalizable test with the ability to be accurately administered to <b>participants</b> <b>aged</b> 8-adult, and no gender effect. Some studies have suggested a significant gender and education interaction indicating that an age-associated decline in visual memory performance may be more prominent for those individuals with a lower education level.|$|E

30|$|By all accounts, {{enforcement}} {{of rules and}} laws by community leaders seemed to occur relatively easily on the reserve, particularly regarding the younger generation; `we respect our leaders and we respect what they say to us and we follow rules - if a leader makes a rule no-body disobeys’ (male FGD <b>participant,</b> <b>aged</b> 24). When asked {{how they feel about}} the development and {{enforcement of}} various laws and rules on the reserve, responses were generally positive; `we feel happy, because when the rule comes, it works on us, it is for our own benefit’ (male FGD <b>participant,</b> <b>aged</b> 18). However, some older participants indicated that the `top-down’ informal governance structure of the KGR was possibly not enjoyed by everyone, despite decisions from the Ardo'en being largely obeyed; `because of the behaviour of our people, some people will start murmuring and arguing why they are prevented from going to such a place. So this is how our people are’ (male FGD <b>participant,</b> <b>aged</b> 72). Still others indicated that the enforcement of laws and rules was a necessary part of life, whatever the circumstance; `everywhere people are based, if they have their leaders, there will be laws’ (female FGD <b>participant,</b> <b>aged</b> 64).|$|R

30|$|The Ardo'en {{held the}} main {{authority}} {{to develop and}} enforce informal laws to benefit those on the reserve. `Only the leaders design and give us the rules. Even us [males] - the leaders do not seek advice from us, even less from the women’ (male FGD <b>participant,</b> <b>aged</b> 26). Rules aiming to promote health and harmony on the reserve were {{the responsibility of the}} Ardo'en, for example where to graze cattle, where to fetch drinking water (`no-one should drink water from the same place as our cattle, it is not good for drinking by humans’), where their children play and even when people are allowed to leave the reserve; `if he says no-one is to go to the crossing [town], then no-one will go to the crossing’ (female FGD <b>participant,</b> <b>aged</b> 65). Ardo'en could also enforce rules regarding social interaction, particularly if it appeared to be detrimental to the wider community. `There is one game played during the night where one sees his colleague and he beats that colleague with a stick. The head of the village called the villagers to attention and gave them a law forbidding them to play that game’ (female FGD <b>participant,</b> <b>aged</b> 45). Regarding livestock health and husbandry, the Ardo'en, assisted by village elders, enforce a number of rules to minimise conflict in the event of livestock disease outbreak; `the head of the village will mobilise the people and tell them they shouldn't go close to that man's cattle, and people will listen to the rule, and they will not go closer’ (male FGD <b>participant,</b> <b>aged</b> 65).|$|R
