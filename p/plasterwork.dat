5|$|The {{gatehouse}} is a two-storied, 17th century {{building with}} exposed timber and <b>plasterwork,</b> constructed in a distinctively local Shropshire style. It features elaborate wooden carvings {{on the exterior}} and interior doorways, including angels, the biblical characters of Adam, Eve and the serpent from the Garden of Eden, as well as dragons and other nude figures. It was designed as essentially an ornamental building, with little defensive value.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its name}} it was {{intended}} for merchants of all types, and a number {{directly involved in the}} Guinea and West Indian slave trade used it for business transactions. Inside the Corn Exchange the <b>plasterwork</b> in the main hall represents the four corners of the world, including Africa and America, the latter wearing a headdress of tobacco leaves. On the outside of the building are carvings of African, American, Asian and European figures and animals, again symbols of Bristol's foreign trade including the Bristol slave trade.|$|E

Her sister, Anne Parr, married William, 1st Earl of Pembroke, whose grandson (the 3rd Earl, also called William) became the first Visitor of the college in 1622. Maud Green's arms are depicted in <b>plasterwork</b> from about 1592 at Powis Castle, owned by a kinsman of the earls. One writer has suggested that the college may have adopted the arms in order to be associated with one of the leading Welsh families of the day.|$|E
5|$|The {{last major}} {{interior}} renovation was in 1922, under {{the ownership of}} managing director Sir Alfred Butt, {{at a cost of}} ₤150,000, leaving a four-tiered theatre able to seat just over 2,000 people. It was decorated {{with one of the most}} notable interiors produced by the specialist ornamental <b>plasterwork</b> company of Clark and Fenn. Composer and performer Ivor Novello, immensely popular in his time though little-remembered today, presented his musicals in Drury Lane from 1931 until the theatre was closed in 1939 because of the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war the theatre served as the headquarters for the Entertainments National Service Association; it sustained some minor bomb damage as well. The theatre reopened with Noël Coward's Pacific 1860 in 1946.|$|E

5|$|The {{plan for}} Prior Park was to {{construct}} five buildings along three {{sides of a}} dodecagon matching the sweep {{of the head of}} the valley, with the main building being flanked by elongated wings based on designs by Andrea Palladio. The plans were influenced by drawings in Vitruvius Britannicus originally made by Colen Campbell for Wanstead House in Essex, which was yet to be built. The main block had 15 bays and each of the wings 17 bays each. Between each wing and the main block was a Porte-cochère for coaches to stop under. In addition to the stone from the local quarries, material, including the grand staircase and <b>plasterwork,</b> from the demolished Hunstrete House were used in the construction.|$|E
5|$|The {{suite of}} state {{rooms on the}} first floor of the east wing {{contains}} the long gallery, library, drawing room (great chamber), small drawing room and two bedrooms. All date originally from the Jacobean mansion, but are likely to have been significantly altered by John Crewe and then extensively reworked by Blore in neo-Jacobean style. They were restored to Barry's designs, usually with little attempt to reproduce the Jacobean appearance, probably because records of most of the original designs were lacking. Crace performed much of the decoration work in these rooms. All the state rooms contain elaborate <b>plasterwork</b> and stone chimneypieces, often flanked with Corinthian columns or pilasters.|$|E
5|$|From November 1984 to June 1987 the DeKalb County Courthouse {{underwent}} {{an interior}} restoration, which {{was completed in}} time for the sesquicentennial celebration for DeKalb County. The restoration, at an approximate cost of $100,000, was undertaken by Conrad Schmitt Studios of New Berlin, Wisconsin. The modern front doors to the courthouse hide the original, beveled glass front doors from view. Once inside the modern doors, the nonfunctional original doors can be seen, standing wide open, to be admired; each door weighs several hundred pounds. Past the doors, in the building's main lobby, is the large, marble staircase to the second floor. The staircase, as well as the lobby's wainscoting, is done in gray Tennessee marble. Most of the first floor is original to the building, including the hexagonal marble flooring, stained glass windows and two original, first floor courtrooms. The <b>plasterwork</b> along the walls and ceilings of the lobby is ornately decorated.|$|E

5000|$|The {{appearance}} of the gate in the 18th century is documented in two works by the engraver Diego Pérez Martínez, one from 1759 and the second from 1788. In the first engraving, the arch is ornately decorated with trimmed plates and Baroque reliefs and <b>plasterworks.</b> On the keystone of the arch {{is a kind of}} mask, adorned with wreaths. The attic—flanked with balusters, large buttresses and pyramids, and topped with a pediment—houses the sculpture of the archangel Michael. In the second engraving, the decorations are much more severe, with some ornaments in recesses in the first section of the pilasters; however, the garland adorning the keystone is the same. It is not known exactly when the redecoration, which incorporated Neoclassical elements, took place.|$|R
5|$|Other {{examples}} include Russborough, designed by Richard Cassels, an architect of German origin, who also designed the Palladian Rotunda Hospital in Dublin, and Florence Court, County Fermanagh. Irish Palladian Country houses often feature robust Rococo <b>plasterwork,</b> frequently {{executed by the}} Lafranchini brothers, an Irish speciality, which is far more flamboyant than the interiors of their contemporaries in England. So much of Dublin {{was built in the}} 18th century that it set a Georgian stamp on the city; however arising out of bad planning and poverty, until recently Dublin {{was one of the few}} cities where fine 18th-century housing could be seen in ruinous condition. Elsewhere in Ireland after 1922, the lead was removed from the roofs of unoccupied Palladian houses for its value as scrap, with the houses often abandoned owing to excessive roof-rate based taxes. Some roofless Palladian houses can still be found in the depopulated Irish countryside.|$|E
5|$|The dining room, {{originally}} the library, {{was designed by}} Lewis Wyatt in about 1808. Wyatt extended the room and added a shallow, semi-circular apse at one end. It features decorative <b>plasterwork</b> on both the ceiling and walls, but is largely unadorned. Wyatt implemented a design featuring gilded acanthus leaves and vines on the ceiling with large-scale egg-and-dart molding around the upper sections of the wall, scagiola columns and a black marble fireplace with bronze ornamentation. Wyatt's alteration works at Rode Hall {{are influenced by the}} style of Sir John Soane, and he described his designs for the interiors as an 'experiment in primitive simplicity... At Rode the primitivist intent is emphasized by the total absence of an entablature.' The room is furnished with original pieces of furniture designed and made by the English manufacturer Gillows of Lancaster and London; of note is the mahogany dining-table and the semi-circular sideboard built into the apse. A Royal Crown Derby dinner service, purchased by Mary Wilbraham-Bootle for her son Randle Wilbraham III in 1809, is on display here.|$|E
5|$|The first {{renovation}} in the 20thcentury {{occurred in}} 1922, when the Supreme Muslim Council under Amin al-Husayni (the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem) commissioned Turkish architect Ahmet Kemalettin Bey to restore al-Aqsa Mosque and the monuments in its precincts. The council also commissioned British architects, Egyptian engineering experts {{and local officials}} to contribute to and oversee the repairs and additions which were carried out in 1924–25 by Kemalettin. The renovations included reinforcing the mosque's ancient Umayyad foundations, rectifying the interior columns, replacing the beams, erecting a scaffolding, conserving the arches and drum of the main dome's interior, rebuilding the southern wall, and replacing timber in the central nave with a slab of concrete. The renovations also revealed Fatimid-era mosaics and inscriptions on the interior arches that had been covered with <b>plasterwork.</b> The arches were decorated with gold and green-tinted gypsum and their timber tie beams were replaced with brass. A quarter of the stained glass windows also were carefully renewed so as to preserve their original Abbasid and Fatimid designs. Severe damage {{was caused by the}} 1837 and 1927 earthquakes, but the mosque was repaired in 1938 and 1942.|$|E
30|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of {{techniques}} available for the analysis of items of cultural heritage. However, the use of traditional techniques to investigate valuable artworks is sometimes impossible, since profuse sampling procedures are forbidden. Fortunately, in recent years, non-destructive/non-invasive techniques such as diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy have been demonstrated to be important techniques for the characterisation of cultural heritage samples, establishing new analytical protocols [1]. The versatility and adaptability of portable/hand-held Raman spectrometers have been demonstrated by studies carried out on rock paintings in caves and rock-shelters [2 – 4], mural paintings [5], <b>plasterworks</b> [6] or valuable collections in museums [7]. Together with portable Raman spectroscopy, portable/hand-held energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (EDXRF) has become a very valuable technique in the field of cultural heritage, for example, in the studies of pottery [8], cave art [9], bronzes [10], wall paintings [11], etc.|$|R
40|$|The {{transformation}} {{dynamics of}} the ancient towns are completely changing the urban landscape of the historical countries in Italy in the last fifty years. The most superficial part of material constitutes {{the image of the}} architectures and plays a meaningful role in the perception of the historical districts that still characterize the contemporary city, but the aptitude for destroying architectural finishes and deleting superficial patina involves therefore to alter the character of the old towns irreversibly. It had to be obvious it would have been essential to conserve the authentic materials and signs of time that denote the historical authenticity of monuments, but new surfaces of plaster have been applied on ancient architecture façades after the destruction of material stratifications; “new” <b>plasterworks</b> but analogous to the ancient one just destroyed. Italian cities become old again this way… old as new! The consequences of this “restoration” method manifested in Italy because of the so-called “typological restoration” that regulated most of the intervention on monuments in the last five decades. Generalized destruction of the historical stratifications were carried out in order to try an illusory return to the lost origins through a restoration conception {{as a matter of fact}} distorted by political and economic interests of various kind, all but cultural. Among the wrong restoration methods the worst is visibly the “Colour plan” (edited for the city of Turin in 1978, for the first time) that suggests to paint the façades of the ancient architecture with new colours in order to clone or simulate the colours of the past, finding in history works of research or scientific tests any probable clue or believable justification. The essay reveals all the theoretical and methodological groundlessness of Colour plans and critically analyses the results all the cities they have been applied in. In particular, it contains some critical examinations regarding Sicilian old towns and plans designed to restore them. It seems that hands don’t run clockwise in Italy and the past repeats cyclically. It could be better for you to explore the isle of Sicily! You could be… just in time...|$|R
3000|$|The term lazurite {{refers to}} the blue mineral of the sodalite group (Na 8 [Al 6 Si 6 O 24]Sn), lapis lazuli to the rock from which it is extracted. Notwithstanding its {{enormous}} price related to its rarity and colour, natural ultramarine was extensively used throughout history, as a decorative stone [1, 20], as a colourant for ceramics [21 – 23], and in paintings and manuscripts both in Asia and Europe starting from the 6 th century [24], {{as well as in}} pre-Columbian cultures [25]. In European contexts, this extremely valuable material was mined in present-day Afghanistan and traded via Venice [1, 20], and it was reserved to specific iconographic elements of the composition, such as Christ and the Virgin’s blue cloaks [1, 20, 26, 27]. It was used both in tempera and oil, to produce either mixtures (with crimson or a white pigment for example) or pure layers, of different opacity according to the binder (e.g. oil based blue glazes painted over a cheaper blue layer [1, 26]). The high price and marvellous colour somehow promoted the development of adulterations, and finally the synthesis of artificial ultramarine in 1828 by Guimet, and in the same year, but with a different process, by Gmelin [1, 20, 28]. Natural ultramarine is stable to light, including lasers [18, 29], heat, acids and alkalis [20, 30, 31]. No oxalates were formed upon exposure of the pigment to oxalic acid [32]. It was however observed that in presence of SO 2 (pollution), the pigment discolours only when liquid water (e.g. condensation) is present [9]. The sulphur present in the crystalline matrix of lazurite does not affect pigments that are otherwise sensitive to hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S), such as leadwhite [20]. No alteration could be observed on decorative <b>plasterworks</b> in the Alhambra (Spain) [33], neither on manuscripts [24]. However, a greyish alteration of the paint surface (“ultramarine sickness”) can be sometimes detected, but it seems that many factors can cause discolouration of lazurite paint layers, such as the oil degradation in presence of humidity [20], or the discolouration of smalt in case of mixtures [20, 34]. It is reported in literature that ultramarine sickness is related to an acidic attack of the pigment by pollutants, biological metabolites, or even acidity of the binder [35, 36]. This hypothesis seems to be confirmed by the fact that, in oil medium, when the basic pigment leadwhite was added to the mixture (to enhance curing, increase opacity and adjust the shade), no visible alteration can be detected, the leadwhite somehow protecting the other pigment [35]. The zeolitic structure of the mineral allows for ion exchanges [20], and for trapping volatile molecules, such as the S 3 [...]...|$|R
5|$|The theatre, {{along with}} the {{neighbouring}} Garrick's Head public house, is a Grade II* listed building and is considered {{a prime example of}} Georgian architecture. The oldest part of the building is the former Garrick's Head on St John's Close. The three storey five bay building, with a basement, has a hipped roof with a part-balustraded parapet. Above the door is a bust of David Garrick, which was made in 1831 by Lucius Gahagan. The Beauford Square side of the building, originally designed by George Dance the Younger, is of five bays with pilasters carrying a frieze of comic and tragic muses. The central door was the main entrance for the pit and galleries. The east front, now the main entrance which opens onto Sawclose, was altered from a plain six-bay entrance by the addition of the round-arched foyer hiding four of the original bays. The 900 seat auditorium has tiers of ornate <b>plasterwork,</b> with red and gilt decoration, and a trompe-l'œil ceiling and glittering chandelier. It has three galleries in a horseshoe plan, supported by cast iron pillars.|$|E
5|$|After the Reformation, and the {{departure}} of the Scottish court in 1603, artists and artisans looked to secular patronage and estate houses became repositories of art and of elaborate furnishings. Estate houses were adorned with paintings, wood carvings and <b>plasterwork.</b> The Grand Tour encouraged the collection of classical art and the adoption of classical styles for new works that were incorporated into the Adam Style. The Baronial revival resulted a synthesised Victorian style that combined elements of the Renaissance, symbols of landed power and national affiliation with modern fittings. From the late sixteenth century, many estate houses were surrounded by gardens influenced by Italian Renaissance gardens. From the late seventeenth century the formal gardens at Versailles and Dutch gardens were important models. In the eighteenth century less formal and symmetrical layouts became common with the development of the jardin anglais. In the nineteenth century there was a return of the formal garden near to the house. The development of the Palladian country house in the seventeenth century separated the family of the householder from the servants. Gentry families spent much of their time visiting family, friends or neighbours and hospitality was an important part of life. Major activities included hunting, cards, chess and music. Large and sumptuous meals were an important part of social life. In the eighteenth century, estate houses were designed as centres of public display, but in the nineteenth century they became increasingly private and developed distinct male areas.|$|E
5|$|As in England, {{commissions}} of new statuary {{tended to}} be made in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. The <b>plasterwork</b> of John Cheere's yard in London was particularly in demand. Also important was the work from the yard of John Bacon (1740–99) who produced a monument for Robert Dundas (d. 1787) at Borthwick Church and one for Mrs Allardyce (d. 1787) at West Church, Aberdeen. Bacon was also a partner in Mrs Eleanor Coade's Artificial Stone Manufactory at Lambeth in London. This produced a buff coloured ceramic that could be moulded to provide fine detail, and be fired in sections, but was impervious to frost and fire. Much cheaper than carved stone, Coade stone was used for sphinxes, balustrading, capitals, coat of arms, tablets, ornamental vases, church monuments and fonts. It was used extensively by the Adam brothers, particularly in the houses they built in Scotland, such as Cullen, Banff, Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, Dunbar Castle, East Lothian, Register House, Edinburgh, Gosford House, East Lothian and Wedderburn, Berwickshire. As well as supplying sculpture, candelabra and cippi, the Adam family supplied designs to the Carron Company, founded in 1759, which produced a wide range of iron products, including stoves, safes, vases and tablets.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century the {{development}} of the Grand Tour took young Scottish aristocrats to the continent, particularly Rome, which was home to the exiled Jacobite Stuarts. This in turn fuelled interest in classical and Renaissance styles, and the buying of artistic works, particularly sculptures. However, the only major Scottish collection of marble before the nineteenth century was that of James Johnstone, 2nd Marquess of Annandale. As in England, commissions of new statuary tended to be crafted in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. The <b>plasterwork</b> of John Cheere's yard in London was particularly in demand. Also important was the work from the yard of John Bacon (1740–99). Bacon was also a partner in Mrs Eleanor Coade's Artificial Stone Manufactory at Lambeth in London.

5|$|The manor of St Catherine {{belonged to}} Prior Cantlow of Bath Abbey in medieval times. It takes {{its name from}} the Church of St Catherine beside the manor house. When the house was not {{occupied}} by the monks it was leased. In 1536 the lease was to Thomas Llewellyn who remained as the tenant after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Henry VIII granted the manor to his tailor, John Malte, in 1546. Part of the condition of the gift was that he adopt the kings illegitimate daughter Ethelreda Malte. Ethelreda inherited the house and married John Harington. After Ethelreda's death in 1551 Harrington married again. His son from this marriage was another John Harington who grew up and became a courtier of Elizabeth I and invented the first flush toilet. He {{spent most of his time}} at his principle seat at nearby Kelston and, in 1591, sold St Catherine's Court to John Blanchard. His son William Blanchard, remodelled the house. His initials appear in the <b>plasterwork</b> frieze of a bedroom. The Blanchard family lived at the court for several generations. In 1610 the porch was added and a terraced garden laid out. The house passed by marriage to the Parry family but was not maintained and the fabric of the building was declining by the 18th century, when half of the building was used by a tenant farmer.|$|E
