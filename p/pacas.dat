5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{have revealed that}} the diet of the inhabitants of Motul de San José included dogs (Canis familiaris), turtles including pond sliders (Trachemys scripta) and Mesoamerican river turtles (Dermatemys mawii), freshwater snails (mostly Pomacea flagellata but also jute snails (Pachychilus spp.)), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red brocket (Mazama americana, a species of small deer), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), lowland <b>pacas</b> (Cuniculus paca), Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) and nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus). Only the dog had been domesticated by the Late Classic Maya so the majority of protein in the diet of the inhabitants came from hunting and fishing within the catchment area around the city. The most common food animals were the white-tailed deer, river clam and river turtle. Some animal remains were recovered that were clearly associated with elite status occupation, {{such as those of}} the jaguar, the ocelot or other small feline and the crocodile (crocodilus spp.). These latter three appear more related to ritual and economic activity than nutritional needs. Freshwater snails were more an ingredient in the diet of lower status families while deer remains were associated with the elite residents of the city.|$|E
5|$|Like all cats, the jaguar is an obligate carnivore, feeding only on meat. It is an {{opportunistic}} {{hunter and}} its diet encompasses at least 87 species. The jaguar can take virtually any terrestrial or riparian vertebrate found in Central or South America, with {{a preference for}} large prey. The jaguar {{is more of a}} dietary generalist than its Old World cousins: the American tropics have a high diversity of small animals but relatively low populations and diversity of the large ungulates which this genus favors. They regularly take adult caimans, deer, capybaras, tapirs, peccaries, dogs, zorros, and sometimes even anacondas. However, the cat will eat any small species that can be caught, including frogs, mice, birds (mainly ground-based species such as cracids), fish, sloths, monkeys, and turtles; a study conducted in Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize, for example, revealed that the diets of jaguars there consisted primarily of armadillos and <b>pacas.</b> Some jaguars will also take domestic livestock. El Jefe, the only jaguar currently living within the territory of the United States, has also been found to kill and eat American black bears, as deduced from hairs found within his scats and the partly consumed carcass of a black bear sow with the distinctive puncture marks to the skull left by jaguars. This indicates that jaguars might have once preyed on black bears when the species was still present in the area. Spectacled bears are also known to avoid jaguars, possibly because they may constitute occasional prey items.|$|E

To understand {{the effects of}} PG acetylation on PG metabolism and release of PG fragments, we have made mutations in the genes responsible for PG acetylation. An insertion mutation in a putative PG acetylase gene (designated <b>pacA)</b> resulted in loss of PG acetylation as detected by a high-performance liquid chromatography-based assay. Sequence analysis of a naturally occurring nonacetylating strain revealed {{the presence of a}} 26 -bp deletion in <b>pacA.</b> Introduction of the deletion mutation into wild-type gonococci resulted in lack of acetylation, and the phenotype was complemented by the addition of a wild-type copy of <b>pacA</b> at a distant location on the chromosome. Mutations were also introduced into three genes downstream of <b>pacA.</b> The gene directly downstream of <b>pacA</b> was required for acetylation and was designated pacB, whereas the next two genes were not required. Sequences highly similar to <b>pacA</b> and pacB were also found in N. meningitidis and N. lactamica strains, and an insertion in the meningococcal <b>pacA</b> eliminated PG acetylation. Phenotypic analyses of an N. gonorrhoeae <b>pacA</b> mutant did not show any decrease in lysozyme resistance or serum resistance, and the release of PG fragments during growth was unchanged. However, purified PG from the wild-type strain was significantly more resistant to the action of human lysozyme than was PG purified from the <b>pacA</b> mutant.

The practice seems to have fallen out of favour by 1847, as Dewees suggested using a nurse or some other skilled person {{to carry out this}} task rather than an animal. Tribal peoples around the world have used many types of animals for the same purpose. Travelers in Guyana observed native women breastfeeding a variety of animals, including monkeys, opossums, <b>pacas,</b> agoutis, peccaries and deer.

Besides the parrots and scarlet and yellow macaws, and other strange-looking birds which we have elsewhere mentioned, there were long-tailed light-coloured cuckoos flying about from tree to tree, not calling like the cuckoo of Europe at all, but giving forth a sound like the creaking of a rusty hinge; there were hawks and buzzards of many different kinds, and red-breasted orioles in the bushes, and black vultures flying overhead, and Muscovy ducks sweeping past with whizzing wings, and flocks of the great wood-ibis sailing in the air on noiseless pinions, and hundreds of other birds that it would require an ornithologist to name; and myriads of insects,--especially ants and spiders, great and small,--that no entomologist could chronicle in a life-time: all these were heard and seen at once; while of the animals that were heard, but not so often seen, there were black and spotted jaguars, and <b>pacas,</b> and cotias, and armadillos, and deer, and many others, that would take pages to enumerate and whole books to describe.|$|E

The Agoutis, however, and <b>Pacas,</b> and other rodents, says Humboldt, have teeth and perseverance to gnaw through the shell; and when the seeds are once out, 'all the animals of the forest, the monkeys, the manaviris, the squirrels, the agoutis, the parrots, the macaws, hasten thither to dispute the prey.

40|$|Abstract Background Pancreatic cancer (<b>PaCa)</b> is a fatal {{human cancer}} {{due to its}} {{exceptional}} resistance to all current anticancer therapies. The cytoprotective enzyme heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) is significantly overexpressed in <b>PaCa</b> and seems {{to play an important}} role in cancer resistance to anticancer treatment. The inhibition of HO- 1 sensitized <b>PaCa</b> cells to chemo- and radiotherapy in vitro. Therefore, we investigated the effects of HO- 1 and its metabolites biliverdin, carbon monoxide and iron on <b>PaCa</b> cells. <b>PaCa</b> cell lines with divergent HO- 1 expression patterns were used in a murine orthotopic cancer model. HO- 1 expression and activity was regulated by zinc (inhibition) and cobalt (induction) protoporphyrin. Furthermore, the influence of cellular HO- 1 levels and its metabolites on effects of standard chemotherapy with gemcitabine was tested in vivo and in vitro. Results High HO- 1 expression in <b>PaCa</b> cell lines was associated with increased chemoresistance in vitro. Chemoresistance to gemcitabine was increased during HO- 1 induction in <b>PaCa</b> cells expressing low levels of HO- 1. The inhibition of HO- 1 activity in pancreatic tumors with high HO- 1 boosted chemotherapeutic effects in vivo significantly. Furthermore, biliverdin and iron promoted <b>PaCa</b> resistance to chemotherapy. Consequently, specific iron chelation by desferrioxamine revealed profound anticancerous effects. Conclusion In summary, the inhibition of HO- 1 and the chelation of iron in <b>PaCa</b> cells were associated with increased sensitivity and susceptibility of pancreatic tumors to chemotherapy in vivo. The metabolites biliverdin and iron seem to be involved in HO- 1 -mediated resistance to anticancer treatment. Therefore, HO- 1 inhibition or direct interference with its metabolites may evolve new <b>PaCa</b> treatment strategies. </p...|$|R

40|$|Insufficient {{production}} of neurotrophic factors is {{implicated in the}} pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the potential of N-propargyl caffeate amide (<b>PACA)</b> to enhance nerve growth factor (NGF) -induced neurite outgrowth and the underlying mechanisms. We discovered that <b>PACA</b> not only potentiated NGF-induced neurite outgrowth but also attenuated 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) neurotoxicity in dopaminergic PC 12 cells and primary rat midbrain neurons. To identify the PACA-binding proteins, we introduced a biotin tag to the covalent PACA-protein adducts via 'click chemistry' alkyne-azido cycloaddition. As a result, kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap 1) was isolated as the predominant protein from <b>PACA</b> treated PC 12 cells. We demonstrated that the formation of PACA-Keap 1 conjugates induced the nuclear translocation of transcription factor Nrf 2 and the expression of antioxidant heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1). Importantly, specific HO- 1 inhibitor SnPP diminished the neuroprotective and neuritogenic activities of <b>PACA.</b> Moreover, <b>PACA</b> attenuated 6 -OHDA-induced {{production of}} neurotoxic reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. <b>PACA</b> also preserved mitochondrial membrane integrity and enhanced the cellular resistance against 6 -OHDA neurotoxicity.

50|$|In the wild, <b>pacas</b> eat fruits from {{understory}} {{trees and}} fallen fruits from taller trees, {{but may also}} eat leaves, buds, flowers, fungi, and insects.

Unlike agoutis, <b>pacas</b> can store fat, and so are less dependent on the caching of seeds. Competition from agoutis is avoided by a slight variation in activity cycles and food preferences. Like rabbits, <b>pacas</b> are coprophagous and absorb protein and carbohydrates from specially produced moist fecal pellets. Before allowing their young to suckle, mothers lick them to stimulate them to defecate and urinate, and then lick the resulting product, both to feed herself and to prevent the odour from attracting predators.|$|E
