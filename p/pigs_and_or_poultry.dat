40|$|International audienceIn {{farm animals}} (bovine, ovine, swine, rabbit and poultry), muscle fibre {{characteristics}} {{play a key}} role in meat quality. The present review summarises the knowledge on muscle fibre characteristics and ontogenesis in these species. Myofibre ontogenesis begins very early during embryonic life, with the appearance of two or three successive waves of myoblasts which constitute the origin of the different types of muscle fibres. In small animals (rodents and poultry), a primary and a secondary generation of fibres arise respectively during the embryonic and foetal stages of development. In the largest species (bovines, sheep, pigs) a third generation arises in the late foetal or early postnatal period. Following these two or three waves of myogenesis, the total number of fibres is fixed. This occurs during foetal life (bovines, ovines, <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry)</b> <b>or</b> during the first postnatal month in rabbits. Contractile and metabolic differentiation proceed by steps in parallel to myogenesis and are partially linked to each other. In bovines and ovines, the main events occur during foetal life, whereas they occur soon after birth in the <b>pig,</b> poultry <b>and</b> rabbit, but some plasticity remains later in life in all species. This comparative survey shows that the cellular processes of differentiation are comparable between species, while their timing is usually species specific...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{prevalence}} {{and diversity of}} Campylobacter in 24 <b>pig</b> herds with <b>and</b> without cattle <b>or</b> <b>poultry</b> was investigated. Feces was collected on each farm from 20 <b>pigs</b> <b>and,</b> if present, 20 cattle <b>or</b> <b>poultry,</b> <b>and</b> examined for Campylobacter spp, including speciation, serotyping and PFGE. C. jejuni was found in pigs in 8 % of herds, but only in < 1 % of pigs, while C. coli was isolated from 92 % of pigs. In contrast, C. jejuni was very prevalent in cattle (43 %) and poultry (32 %) in mixed herds. Matching serotypes of C. jejuni were not found in <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> cattle <b>or</b> <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> <b>poultry,</b> but PFGE typing confirmed that two C. coli serotypes were indistinguishable between <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> cattle. The results {{show that there is}} no substantial transmission of C. jejuni from cattle <b>or</b> <b>poultry</b> to pigs in mixed production herds. Introduction Campylobacteriosis is a zoonosis of increasing importance in industrialized countries. In Denmark, Campylobacter is {{the most common cause of}} zoonotic human enteritis with an inci-dence of 66 per 100, 000 inhabitants in 2003 (Anonymous, 2004). The majority (90 %) of Danish human cases are caused by Campylobacter jejuni, whereas 5 % are diagnosed as C. coli. Poultry and cattle are considered to be the main reservoir for C. jejuni, whereas C. coli is predominantl...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Study {{possible}} {{links between}} vancomycin-resistant enterococci strains isolated from human stool samples <b>and</b> from pork <b>or</b> <b>poultry</b> food products. Methods: One hundred and eleven vancomycin-resistant enterococci strains (15 VanA and 96 VanC) were isolated from human stool samples <b>and</b> from pork <b>or</b> <b>poultry</b> food products. Characterization of the Tn 1546 -like {{element of the}} 15 VanA strains was realized by restriction analysis of PCR products and polymorphism study. The 96 strains of VanC phenotype (75 Enterococcus gallinarum and 21 Enterococcus casseliflavus) were analysed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: In the study described here, polymorphism of the Tn 1546 -like element enabled the establish-ment of five groups. Groups III, IV and V were found only in human strains. Groups I and II were found to occur in strains isolated from humans and from food, suggesting a possible transfer of the Tn 1546 -like element. The isolates from Group I harboured the whole Tn 1546 element. In Group II, the five strains possessed a novel Tn 1546 -like element, characterized by a single-nucleotide difference in the vanX gene and a deletion upstream from the nucleotide 164. Analysis by PFGE of the 75 E. gallinarum strains revealed 20 different patterns. One pattern was shared by isolates from pork food and human samples. None of the 21 E. casseliflavus strains tested was found to share similar PFGE patterns. Conclusions: Results tend to support the possible transfer of the Tn 1546 -like element between strains of VanA phenotype. Concerning VanC phenotype strains, the transfer was not demonstrated...|$|R

50|$|Tusks are elongated, {{continuously}} growing front teeth, usually but {{not always}} in pairs, that protrude well beyond the mouth of certain mammal species. They are most commonly canines, as with warthogs, <b>pig,</b> <b>and</b> walruses, <b>or,</b> {{in the case of}} elephants, elongated incisors. In most tusked species both the males and the females have tusks although the males' are larger. Tusks are generally curved, though the narwhal's sole tusk is straight and has a helical structure. In the elephant, the tusks were originally second incisors. Continuous growth is enabled by formative tissues in the apical openings of the roots of the teeth. In earlier times elephant tusks weighing over 200 pounds (more than 90 kg) were not uncommon, though it is rare today to see any over 100 pounds (45 kg).|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the causes of neonatal mortality among pig farms in Nsukka Local Government area of Enugu State, Nigeria. Forty (40) pig farms in the study area were randomly selected and used for the 20 weeks study duration. One week post partum was considered as the neonatal period. A total of 124 pregnant sows and 924 piglets farrowed during the study period were used. Data were obtained from farm visitations/physical observations, farm records, oral interviews and structured questionnaires. Feed samples were analyzed for their proximate contents. Pregnant pigs were weighed prior, during and few days after farrowing, while piglets were weighed within seven days after farrowing. Necropsy and bacteriological examinations of samples of feed, maternal <b>and</b> diseased <b>or</b> dying neonates were also carried out. Results showed that mean litter size, piglet weight at birth and daily weight gain were 7. 45 ± 0. 02, 1. 01 ± 0. 03 and 0. 21 ± 0. 01 kg, respectively. 164 (17. 75 %) of total piglets farrowed died within the first week of life (neonatal period), whereas 144 (87. 80 %) of this number died within the first five days.
