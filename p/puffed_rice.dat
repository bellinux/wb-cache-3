25|$|Korean temple cuisine {{originated}} in Buddhist temples of Korea. Since Buddhism was introduced into Korea, Buddhist traditions have strongly influenced Korean cuisine, as well. During the Silla period (57 BCE– 935 CE), chalbap (찰밥, {{a bowl of}} cooked glutinous rice) yakgwa (a fried dessert) and yumilgwa (a fried and <b>puffed</b> <b>rice</b> snack) were served for Buddhist altars and have been developed into types of hangwa, Korean traditional confectionery. During the Goryeo Dynasty, sangchu ssam (wraps made with lettuce), yaksik, and yakgwa were developed, and since spread to China and other countries.

25|$|A very {{different}} method of popcorn-making {{can still be}} seen on the streets of some Chinese cities and Korea today. The un-popped corn kernels are poured into a large cast-iron canister — sometimes called a 'popcorn hammer' — that is then sealed with a heavy lid and slowly turned over a curbside fire in rotisserie fashion. When a pressure gauge on the canister reaches a certain level, the canister is removed from the fire, a large canvas sack is put over the lid and the seal is released. With a huge boom, all of the popcorn explodes at once and is poured into the sack. This method {{is believed to have been}} developed, during the Song dynasty, originally for <b>puffing</b> <b>rice.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rice {{can also}} be puffed by making a rice dough, and {{extruding}} small pellets which are then rapidly heated. The moisture in the dough flash boils and <b>puffs</b> the <b>rice</b> up.

2500|$|Starting in 1902, Quaker Oats oatmeal boxes {{came with}} a coupon redeemable for the legal deed to a tiny lot in Milford. The lots, {{sometimes}} as small as [...] by 10 feet, were carved out of a [...] tract in a never-built subdivision called [...] "Liberty Park". A small number of children (or their parents), often residents living near Milford, collected the deeds and started paying the extremely small property taxes on the [...] "oatmeal lots". The developer of the prospective subdivision hoped the landowners would hire him to build homes on the lots, although several lots {{would need to be}} combined before building could start. Since the subdivision into small lots predated Milford's planning and zoning regulations, the deeds were entirely legal, although they created a large amount of paperwork for town tax collectors, who frequently couldn't find the property owners and received almost no tax revenue from the lots.In the mid-1970s, when the town wanted to develop the area, town officials {{put an end to the}} oatmeal lots in a [...] "general foreclosure" [...] that avoided the enormous expense of individual foreclosures by condemning nearly all of the property in one legal filing. One of the streets in the Liberty Park subdivision plans, Shelland Street, was later built in the late 1990s as an access road to the Milford Power Company. The site is currently home to the BIC Corporation's lighter factory at 565 Bic Drive.

40|$|A high {{performance}} liquid chromatographic method {{was developed for}} determination of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) in foods using a monolithic column with sample clean up on an immunoaffinity column. The method was validated for analysis of AFB 1 in <b>rice,</b> bread, <b>puffed</b> corn snack, wheat flour and peanut samples. The average recoveries for AFB 1 in different foods ranged from 94. 4 to 102. 5 % with the coefficient of variation lower than 10 % for all foods. Limit of detection was 0. 01 ng/g. A survey of AFB 1 was performed on 90 samples collected from Tehran retail market in June 2005. The results showed {{that none of the}} bread and wheat flour samples were contaminated with AFB 1.

Although all food samples had mean concentration of AFB 1 below the maximum tolerated level in Iran, the mean intake of AFB 1 from rice was estimated 3. 49 times higher than the guidance value of 1 ng AFB 1 /Kg body weight/day.

40|$|Oat-based {{product has}} long been {{identified}} as a highly desirable food. It has a high nutritional profile due to its high concentration of protein, good distribution of amino acids, and rich fiber content when compared to other grains. Puffed oat cakes may appeal to consumers due, in part, to their low fat, low calorie, high fiber, and whole grain properties which fit well with healthy claims, key snacking trends, and the shift in American dietary attitudes. However, their physical and sensory properties have not been reported in the literature. Oat cakes were produced by a two-step process: 1) extrude oat flour to make pellets and 2) puff oat pellets in a rice cake machine. A 2 × 3 × 4 × 3 factorial design consisting of four variables and with 2 replications was used to study the effects of extrusion, tempering and puffing conditions on the puffed oat cakes. The four independent variables are extrudate moisture content (30 and 34 % wb), tempering moisture content (10, 12, and 14 % wb), heating temperature (238, 243, 249, and 254 °C), and heating time (4, 6, and 8 s). Physical properties of oat cakes (specific volume, color, hardness, and integrity) and descriptive sensory analysis were conducted. The results showed that extruded oat pellets can be successfully <b>puffed</b> by a <b>rice</b> cake machine to make oat cakes. All the four processing variables (heating time, heating temperature, extrudate moisture content, and tempering moisture content) had significant effects on the oat cake s physical and sensory properties. Heating time had the most significant effect. Increasing heating time resulted in oat cakes with increased specific volume, integrity, and redness, but lower lightness and yellowness. Also, Pincipal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that high correlations existed between instrumental and sensory descriptive analysis. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|R
