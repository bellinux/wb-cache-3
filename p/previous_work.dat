5|$|Brubaker {{received}} {{calls from}} interested parties in Hollywood about adapting The Fade Out {{very early in}} its publication. However, {{he did not want}} to sell the rights until the series was finished. He had done so with a <b>previous</b> <b>work,</b> and it affected the way he wrote it because he was imagining it in the other medium.|$|E

She considered {{the writing of}} songs for Ketika Cinta Bertasbih {{to be more difficult}} than her <b>previous</b> <b>work</b> in teen romances, as it was a religious film. As such, she felt that she had to be extra careful.|$|E
30|$|Table  6 {{also shows}} the {{implementation}} {{comparison between the}} proposed architecture and our <b>previous</b> <b>works</b> in [18]. Our <b>previous</b> <b>works</b> in [18] can only support 4 K-UHD video real-time encoding with the frame rate of 47, and the proposed architecture can support 8 K-UHD video real-time encoding with the frame rate of 78. The proposed architecture can also achieve about 42  % area reduction and 40  % power reduction compared to our <b>previous</b> <b>works</b> in [18]. These speed and cost improvement come from both the new fast interpolation filter algorithm and hardware efficiency.|$|R

50|$|Crimson Thorn {{announced}} at Cornerstone Festival 2007 {{that they were}} working on a new album.

5|$|In December 1933, Marquis {{began his}} last book, Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself: The True Story of Custer's Last Stand. Marquis {{considered}} this {{his most important}} work– the subject was his central interest and he regarded much of his <b>previous</b> <b>work</b> as mere preparation for it. The book was completed in March 1934. However, his publisher, the Midwest Company, {{went out of business}} shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The Harris Theater was {{designed}} by Thomas Beeby of Hammond Beeby Rupert Ainge Architects; his <b>previous</b> <b>work</b> in Chicago includes the Harold Washington Library Center and the Art Institute of Chicago Building's Rice Wing.

Construction began on , 2002, and the theater opened for use on , 2003.|$|E
5|$|The album {{maintains}} the ska punk and reggae influences of the band's <b>previous</b> <b>work,</b> but with slower, more ballad-like songs. The lyrics {{to many of}} the songs describe singer Gwen Stefani's pining for a more domestic life, contrasting that with her commitment to a music career.|$|E

5|$|The {{record was}} a {{departure}} from Jackson's <b>previous</b> <b>work</b> for Motown Records. Its lyrical themes on the record relate to escapism, liberation, loneliness, hedonism and romance. Several critics observed that Off the Wall was crafted from funk, disco, soft rock, jazz, Broadway and pop ballads. Jackson received positive reviews for his vocal performance on the record. The record gained critical acclaim and recognition, and won the singer his first Grammy Award.|$|E
5|$|The {{triptych}} summarises themes {{explored in}} Bacon's <b>previous</b> <b>work,</b> including his examination of Picasso's biomorphs and his {{interpretations of the}} Crucifixion and the Greek Furies. Bacon did not realise his original intention to paint a large crucifixion scene and place the figures {{at the foot of}} the cross.|$|E
5|$|Ummagumma {{represented}} {{a departure from}} their <b>previous</b> <b>work.</b> Released as a double-LP on EMI's Harvest label, the first two sides contained live performances recorded at Manchester College of Commerce and Mothers, a club in Birmingham. The second LP contained a single experimental contribution from each band member. Ummagumma received positive reviews upon its release, in November 1969. The album peaked at number 5, spending 21 weeks on the UK chart.|$|E

5|$|A {{departure}} from her <b>previous</b> <b>work,</b> Ray of Light is an electronica, dance and techno-pop album which incorporates multiple genres, including ambient, trip hop and house music. Vocally, the album saw Madonna sing with greater breadth and a fuller tone. Mystical themes are also strongly present {{in both the}} music and lyrics, {{as a result of}} Madonna embracing Kabbalah, her study of Hinduism and Buddhism, as well as her daily practice of Hatha Yoga.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was filmed in late May, co-directed by the singer and her {{production}} team, Haus of Gaga. The video is simple in contrast to much of Gaga's <b>previous</b> <b>work,</b> and portrays her dancing on a fire-escape and walking on a lonely street. Differences include the lack of intricate choreography and back-up dancers, as well as using only one outfit designed by Versace. Critics lauded {{the simplicity of the}} video, while comparing it to the works of Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson and Madonna. Gaga has performed the song in award shows, music festivals and her concert tours.|$|E
5|$|After its release, Music Box {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. The album faced criticism regarding Carey's more mellow and lazy tone {{in comparison to}} her <b>previous</b> <b>work.</b> Despite some unfavorable reviews, the album became a commercial success, topping the Billboard 200 and becoming Carey's first number-one album in Australia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it Diamond, for shipments of ten million copies across the United States.

5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's <b>previous</b> <b>work</b> had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} him to have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.|$|E
5|$|Expanding on the {{aggressive}} {{sound of the}} band's <b>previous</b> <b>work,</b> Congregation has more refined musical details and slower songs such as ballads. Its music also incorporates R, soul, and funk influences. The album's cover depicts a nude black woman holding a white {{baby in her arms}} and alludes comically to the band's African-American music influences. The songs have themes of pleasure and guilt, and deal with topics such as dysfunctional relationships and sexual deviancy. Conceived during the burgeoning grunge scene, the album has been viewed by music writers as stylistically distinct from other Sub Pop and grunge music.|$|E
5|$|Former Eon Productions' {{editor and}} {{director}} of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Peter R.

A number of the crew from the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark were also appointed, including first assistant director David Tomblin, director of photography Douglas Slocombe and production designers Philip Harrison and Stephen Grimes.|$|E

40|$|Reinforcement {{learning}} is an adaptive and flexible control method for autonomous system. In our <b>previous</b> <b>works,</b> we had proposed a reinforcement learning algorithm for redundant systems: "Q-learning with dynamic structuring of exploration space based on GA (QDSEGA) ", and applied it to multi-agent systems. However <b>previous</b> <b>works</b> of the QDSEGA have been restricted to homogeneous agents. In this paper, we extend our <b>previous</b> <b>works</b> of multi-agent systems, and propose a hybrid autonomous control method for heterogeneous multi-agent systems. To demonstrate {{the effectiveness of}} the proposed method, simulations of transportation task by 10 heterogeneous mobile robots have been carried out.

5|$|In 1894, after Smith {{returned}} from Germany, she published her second volume Songs for Little Children, Part 2. As in her <b>previous</b> <b>work,</b> {{most of the}} songs were in major keys with the most common being A-flat major and E-flat major. Second, third, fourth and fifth intervals were typical in her voice scores with the piano accompaniment creating interest through varied rhythm patterns. In this volume, most of the compositions were Smith's own work, {{though some of the}} pieces were adaptations of German folk songs.|$|E
5|$|Recorded at Island Records' {{studio in}} London, {{it was their}} first album with John Evan as a {{full-time}} member, their first with new bassist Jeffrey Hammond, and last album featuring Clive Bunker on drums. Something of {{a departure from the}} band's <b>previous</b> <b>work,</b> the album features more acoustic material than previous releases; and—inspired by photographs of homeless people on the Thames Embankment taken by singer Ian Anderson's wife Jennie—contains a number of recurring themes, addressing religion along with Anderson's own personal experiences.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} music of both {{sessions}} for its free, relaxed sound, but the lyrics {{were considered to be}} simple compared with those of his <b>previous</b> <b>work.</b> Morrison had intended to record the album a cappella with only vocal backing by a vocal group he called the Street Choir, but the songs released on the album that included the choir also featured a backing band. Morrison was dissatisfied with additional vocalists to the original quintet that made up the choir, and these changes and others have led him to regard Street Choir poorly in later years.|$|E
