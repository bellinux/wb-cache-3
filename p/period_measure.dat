It is uncommercial because, if it is demanded that the charterers need to know more than they already do in the ordinary course of events, when they already know that a new fixture, in all probability fixed at or around the time of redelivery, will follow on their own charter, then the demand is for something that cannot be provided. All that an owner will be able to tell his charterer in most cases is that he plans to fix his vessel anew at the time of redelivery. To which the charterer might reply: ‘well I know that already!

40|$|Abstract Background In April 2005, syndromic {{surveillance}} {{based on}} statistical control chart methods in Sydney, Australia, signalled increasing incidence of urgent emergency department visits for cardiovascular and chest pain syndromes {{compared to the}} preceding twelve months. This paper aimed to determine whether environmental factors could {{have been responsible for}} this 'outbreak'. Methods The outcome studied was daily counts of emergency department visits for cardiovascular or chest pain syndromes that were considered immediately or imminently life threatening on arrival at hospital. The outbreak had a mean daily count of 5. 7 visits sustained for eight weeks, compared with 4. 0 in the same months in previous years. Poisson regression was used to systematically assess the emergency department visits in relation to available daily weather and pollution variables by first finding the best model that explained short-term variation in the outcome over the period 25 January 2002 to 31 May 2005, and then assessing interactions of all available variables with the 'outbreak' period, April-May 2005. Rate ratios were estimated for an interquartile increase in each variable meaning that the ratio measures the relative increase (or decrease) in the emergency department visits for an interquartile increase in the weather or pollution variable. The rate ratios for the outbreak <b>period</b> <b>measure</b> the relative increase (or decrease) in the emergency department visits for an interquartile increase in the weather or pollution variable during the outbreak period only. Results The best fitting model over the whole study period included minimum temperature with a rate ratio (RR) of 0. 86 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 77 – 0. 96), maximum relative humidity of 1. 09 (95 % CI 1. 05 – 1. 14) and minimum daily particulate matter less than 10 microns (PM 10) of 1. 05 (95 % CI, 1. 01 – 1. 09). During the outbreak period, maximum temperature (RR 1. 27, 95 % CI 1. 03 – 1. 57), solar radiation (RR 1. 44, 95 % CI, 1. 00 – 2. 07) and ozone (RR 1. 13, 95 % CI 1. 01 – 1. 26) were associated with the outcome. Conclusion The increase may have been associated with photochemical pollution.

The aim of the review was to summarize the processes, {{which led to the}} recent form of AES. In practical part of the thesis measures, which support maintaining and increasing of populations of ground game and birdlife, i. e. measures Catch Crops, Rich Seed Habitat (Biobelt), and Bird Area on Grasslands were evaluated. Data from Paying Agency SZIF were used. The study covers both, the (shortened) programming period 2004 - 2006 and the programming period 2007 { [...] } 2013 (years 2004 { [...] } 2008). Thesis is focused on region NUTS II Southeast. The following indicators were analysed: interest of the farmers in the selected AES measures, area on which the measures were carried out and amount of the financial support spent to support individual measures. Finally, steps to optimize the use of financial resources are suggested. Catch Crops are used as a measure on arable land. The highest interest of the farmers in Catch Crops was observed in the year 2004, when the largest number of the farmers entered this measure. The interest was decreasing in the following years (especially in the years 2007 and 2008, when the endowment was lowered). Catch Crops cover 6 { [...] } 8 % of the arable land of the region and the area has been increasing in time.

40|$|This thesis {{offers the}} first full study of English {{productions}} of Measure for Measure on stage and screen from the Jacobean period to the early twenty-first century, based on archival research examining primary sources such as prompt books, video recordings and photographs. Because of its ambiguity and open silences, Measure for Measure is an ideal text to demonstrate W. B. Worthen’s thesis that, in performance, meanings are produced through various theatrical factors which necessarily go beyond the text. In this thesis, I argue that the ambiguity of Measure for Measure maximises its potential in production to reflect social and political climates of the time, anticipate changes and shape spectators’ perceptions of difficult issues such as authority, morality and gender politics. This argument is supported through my investigation into archival research which reveals how social context influenced productions and how those productions, in turn, shaped future productions and society. The Introduction argues that Measure for Measure is an ideal text to demonstrate Worthen’s concepts that the ‘work’ is always absent, and that ‘Shakespeare’ and {{the words in the}} text are not the most important sources of meaning. There are many crucial gaps in the text that performances need to fill. The Introduction analyses space, audience, actor and scenography as important factors which shape meaning and effect. In the first chapter, I argue that, because of its indeterminacy, in the early modern <b>period,</b> <b>Measure</b> for Measure helped not only to reaffirm the absolute authority of the monarchy but also to cultivate scepticism towards it, and how spectators at Whitehall and the Globe read performances would have depended on the conditions of the playing venues, spectators’ social statuses, gender and religious beliefs. Chapter Two argues that, in adapting the text of Measure for Measure or transcoding it into a different, two-dimensional media of the screen, the adaptor sets himself up as a rival authority to that of Shakespeare and, in consequence, changes our perception of the ‘work’. The adaptations of Measure for Measure from the Restoration to the modern period, both on stage and on screen, are covered in this chapter. Chapter Three argues that performance spaces have a strong impact on playgoers’ reactions towards performances and the spectators’ attitudes towards the genre and issues of authority and morality. This chapter focuses on the ‘Elizabethan’ revival productions of William Poel, arguing that it contributed to the view of Measure for Measure as a ‘problem play’; the production by John Dove, which revived its reputation as a comedy, and modern touring productions. Chapter Four argues that productions of Measure for Measure from the Georgian period to the 1960 s tried to solve the play’s ambiguous treatment of morality, authority, gender politics and ‘vulgarity’ and, in so doing, such productions reflected, anticipated and shaped not only ‘Shakespeare’ but also society. The final chapter argues that, as publicly-funded theatres, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre have a commitment to speak to the nation and, due to their agendas and policies, the productions of Measure for Measure after 1970 at the National successfully engaged with contemporary issues of gender politics, racial equality and state power while the Royal Shakespeare Company largely failed to engage with these difficult issues...|$|E

The ventricular refractory <b>periods</b> were <b>measured</b> in the baseline state and after oral treatment with quinidine or mexiletine in 20 subjects each. In the baseline state, there was progressive shortening of the ventricular refractory period as the drive train duration increased from two beats to 3 minutes.

In conclusion, neither quinidine nor mexiletine affect the adaptation of ventricular refractoriness to an increase in rate.
