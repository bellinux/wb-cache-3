In his teens, he began {{developing}} {{a keen interest in}} radios, vacuum tube circuits, and <b>pipe</b> <b>organs.</b> He served as a radio operator for the U.S. Army near the end of World War II, and while stationed in New York City, developed a further fascination with the sound and mechanics of <b>pipe</b> <b>organs.</b> He founded Haygren Organ Company to build electronic <b>pipe</b> <b>organs</b> with a sound he felt better matched real <b>pipe</b> <b>organs,</b> and was the first to use multiple oscillators in the organ design to produce a genuine ensemble. He also focused on the realistic attack and decay of individual electronic notes.|$|R

5|$|The cathedral's <b>pipe</b> <b>organ</b> {{was built}} in 1955 by Orgelbau Kuhn AG of Männedorf, Switzerland, for the Reformed Evangelical Basel Münster Cathedral in Basel, Switzerland.

The pipes were transported wrapped in new garments donated {{by the people of}} Basel, which were later distributed to Moscow's poor. The installation of the <b>pipe</b> <b>organ</b> in Moscow was performed by the Orgelbau Schmid company from Kaufbeuren, Germany, headed by Gerhard Schmid, who refused payment for his work.

5|$|Related to {{this use}} of resonance, Messiaen also {{composed}} music in which the lowest, or fundamental, note is combined with higher notes or chords played much more quietly.

5|$|The <b>pipe</b> <b>organ</b> is {{a musical}} {{instrument}} that produces sound by driving pressurized air (called wind) through organ pipes selected via a keyboard. Because each pipe produces a single pitch, the pipes are provided in sets called ranks, {{each of which has}} a common timbre and volume throughout the keyboard compass. Most organs have multiple ranks of pipes of differing timbre, pitch, and volume that the player can employ singly or in combination through the use of controls called stops.|$|E
