5|$|A fifth {{generating}} unit fueled by {{natural gas and}} oil {{was added to the}} Turkey <b>Point</b> generating station in 2007. In 2009, Turkey <b>Point</b> was proposed as the site of two new 1117MW AP1000 nuclear reactors, to be designated Turkey <b>Point</b> 6 and 7. If built, the new reactors would make Turkey <b>Point</b> one of the largest generating sites in the United States. Other neighboring influences on the bay are the agricultural lands of south Miami-Dade County, a sewage treatment facility on the park boundary at Black <b>Point,</b> and its neighbor, the South Miami-Dade Landfill.|$|E

5|$|At Tupper Lake, {{the route}} serves {{a cluster of}} {{recreational}} buildings at its intersection with Warren <b>Point</b> Road, a private drive leading to Warren <b>Point.</b> Here, NY421 turns southward, running along the lake shore to nearby Paradise <b>Point</b> Road, which leads east to Paradise <b>Point</b> and the lakeside Veterans' Mountain Camp. After Paradise <b>Point</b> Road, the highway follows a winding, southeasterly course along Tupper Lake, passing little more than dense forests while crossing over the Bog River near its mouth. NY421 follows the lake to its southern tip, where the route ends at an intersection with NY30 {{just west of the}} St. LawrenceFranklin county line.|$|E

5|$|Cedar <b>Point</b> {{has had a}} {{cultural}} influence on American society as evidenced in many forms of media such as books, television, and film. In the 1940 biographical film Knute Rockne, All American documenting the life of famous Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne, Cedar <b>Point</b> is featured at a pivotal <b>point</b> in the story. In 1913, Knute works as a lifeguard on a beach at Cedar <b>Point,</b> {{where he and his}} college roommate Gus Dorais worked on the forward pass. The concept, which was first used in a scrimmage game at Cedar <b>Point,</b> would revolutionize the sport and the film would later be preserved in the Library of Congress National Film Registry. In 2004, an independently-produced film, Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind: Infestation From Mars, was shot at several historic locations around Sandusky including Cedar <b>Point.</b> Dick Kinzel, CEO of Cedar Fair at the time, had a brief speaking role in the film.|$|E

5|$|Dew <b>point</b> is the {{temperature}} {{to which a}} given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The dew <b>point</b> is a saturation <b>point.</b> When the dew <b>point</b> temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost <b>point,</b> as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The dew <b>point</b> is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the dew <b>point</b> is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the dew <b>point</b> is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant dew <b>point,</b> an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the dew <b>point</b> determines the specific humidity of the air. The dew <b>point</b> is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|E
