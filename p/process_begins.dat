5|$|Dislocation {{diffusion}} {{occurs when}} adjacent sub-units of a cluster {{move in a}} row-by-row fashion through displacement of a dislocation. As shown in figure 11(a) the <b>process</b> <b>begins</b> with nucleation of the dislocation followed by what is essentially sequential displacement on a concerted basis.|$|E

The process is governed by the Olympic Charter, as stated in Chapter 5, Rule 34.|$|E

5|$|Many of the Quest's {{rules are}} {{intended}} to ensure the health of dogs in hazardous conditions. This <b>process</b> <b>begins</b> before the race, when all dogs must be examined by race veterinarians, who certify that the animals are suited and healthy enough to participate. Before the race, dog equipment also must be checked by race officials. Padded harnesses are required, each musher must carry an appropriate amount of food, and additional food supplies must be in position at checkpoints.|$|E
5|$|The <b>process</b> <b>begins</b> {{with the}} Multiple Property Documentation Form, which {{acts as a}} cover {{document}} rather than the nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The purpose of the documentation form is to establish the basis of eligibility for related properties. The information of the Multiple Property Documentation Form {{can be used to}} nominate and register related historic properties simultaneously, or to establish criteria for properties that may be nominated in the future. Thus, additions to an MPS can occur over time.|$|E
5|$|Hemimetabolous insects, {{those with}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing {{a series of}} molts. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting <b>process</b> <b>begins</b> as the insect's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside the old one. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. When this stage is complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest.|$|E

5|$|Internal {{broaching}} is more involved. The <b>process</b> <b>begins</b> by clamping {{the workpiece}} into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in the broaching machine. The broaching machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the broach above the workholder, then lowers the broach through the workpiece. Once through, the broaching machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the broach. The elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the broach is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|E
5|$|The {{exercises}} are intended as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through {{an experience of}} Christian meditation. The entire experience takes about 30 days and often involves a daily interview with the director. The <b>process</b> <b>begins</b> with {{a consideration of the}} purpose of one's life and the relationship with the rest of creation. It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences. Next comes a period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another for thinking about his suffering and death. The final week is to experience the joy of the resurrection, and in conclusion to reflect on God's love and the response of love for God.|$|E

25|$|The {{biofouling}} <b>process</b> <b>begins</b> when algae spores, {{marine invertebrate}} larvae, and other organic material adhere to surfaces submerged in marine environments (e.g., fish nets in aquaculture). Bacteria then encourage the attachment of secondary unwanted colonizers.|$|E
25|$|The typical {{development}} <b>process</b> <b>begins</b> with one- and two-year-old children developing larger bladders {{and beginning}} to sense bladder fullness. Two- and three-year-old children begin to stay dry during the day. Four- and five-year-olds develop an adult pattern of urinary control and begin to stay dry at night.|$|E
25|$|The <b>process</b> <b>begins</b> {{by forming}} an allylic amine from myrcene, which {{undergoes}} asymmetric isomerisation {{in the presence}} of a BINAP rhodium complex to give (after hydrolysis) enantiomerically pure R-citronellal. This is cyclised by a carbonyl-ene-reaction initiated by zinc bromide to isopulegol, which is then hydrogenated to give pure (1R,2S,5R)-menthol.|$|E

25|$|An {{information}} retrieval <b>process</b> <b>begins</b> when a user enters a query into the system.

A dummy block is placed behind it where the ram then presses on the material to push {{it out of the}} die. Afterward the extrusion is stretched in order to straighten it. If better properties are required then it may be heat treated or cold worked.|$|E
25|$|Fresh {{tomatoes}} {{received at}} a tomato processing plant {{can be turned}} into a variety of different products, one of which includes ketchup. The <b>process</b> <b>begins</b> by washing the tomatoes to remove any outer dirt and foreign matter from the skin prior to processing. Upon inspection, damaged, spoiled or unwanted tomatoes will be sorted out manually. Tomatoes will usually be conveyed by water throughout the preliminary stages to avoid bruising.|$|E
