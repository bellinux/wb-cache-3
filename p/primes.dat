5|$|In 1958, Florence Ballard—a {{junior high}} school student living in the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects in Detroit—met Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks, two members of a Detroit male singing group known as the <b>Primes.</b> Since Ballard sang, as did Paul Williams' girlfriend Betty McGlown, the Primes's manager Milton Jenkins decided to create a sister group to the <b>Primes</b> called the Primettes. Ballard {{recruited}} her best friend Mary Wilson, who in turn recruited classmate Diane Ross. Mentored and funded by Jenkins, the Primettes began by performing hit songs by artists such as Ray Charles and the Drifters at sock hops, social clubs and talent shows around the Detroit area. Receiving additional guidance from group friend and established songwriter Jesse Greer, the quartet quickly earned a local fan following. The girls crafted an age-appropriate style that {{was inspired by the}} collegiate dress of popular doo-wop group Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers; and, for the most part, Ballard, Ross and Wilson performed equal leads on songs. Within a few months, guitarist Marvin Tarplin was added to the Primettes' lineup—a move that helped distinguish the group from Detroit's many other aspiring acts by allowing the girls to sing live instead of lip-synching.|$|E

Investigations in this direction can motivate such concepts as greatest common divisors, modular arithmetic, Fermat <b>primes,</b> order of group elements, and quadratic reciprocity.|$|E

5|$|Euler also {{pioneered the}} use of {{analytic}} methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic number theory. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic trigonometric functions and the analytic theory of continued fractions. For example, he proved the infinitude of <b>primes</b> using the divergence of the harmonic series, and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler's {{work in this area}} {{led to the development of}} the prime number theorem.|$|E
5|$|Home was {{generally}} warmly regarded by colleagues and opponents alike, {{and there were}} few politicians who did not respond well to him.

Macleod, Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1959–61, was, like Butler, on the liberal wing of the Conservative party; he was convinced, as Home was not, that Britain's colonies in Africa should have majority rule and independence as quickly as possible. Their spheres of influence overlapped in the Central African Federation.|$|E

5|$|Euler proved Newton's identities, Fermat's little theorem, Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, {{and he made}} {{distinct}} {{contributions to}} Lagrange's four-square theorem. He also invented the totient function φ(n), the number of positive integers {{less than or equal}} to the integer n that are coprime to n. Using properties of this function, he generalized Fermat's little theorem to what is now known as Euler's theorem. He contributed significantly to the theory of perfect numbers, which had fascinated mathematicians since Euclid. He proved that the relationship shown between perfect numbers and Mersenne <b>primes</b> earlier proved by Euclid was one-to-one, a result otherwise known as the Euclid–Euler theorem. Euler also conjectured the law of quadratic reciprocity. The concept is regarded as a fundamental theorem of number theory, and his ideas paved the way for the work of Carl Friedrich Gauss.|$|E
