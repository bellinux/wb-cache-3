5|$|Queen Mary 2 is a <b>post-Panamax</b> ship. As a result, Queen Mary 2 must {{circumnavigate}} South America {{to cross}} between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The {{decision not to}} constrain her size to transit the Panama Canal was taken as Queen Elizabeth 2 only transited once a year, during the world cruise. Cunard decided to pass up the convenience of the occasional passage in favour of a greater passenger capacity.|$|E
5|$|The Panama Canal had {{a limited}} {{capacity}} determined by operational times and cycles {{of the existing}} locks and further constrained by the current trend towards larger (close to Panamax-sized) vessels transiting the canal which take more transit time within the locks and navigational channels, {{and the need for}} permanent periodical maintenance works due to the aging canal, which forces periodical shutdowns of this waterway. On the other hand, demand has been growing due to the rapid growth of international trade. Also, many users require a guarantee of certain level of service. Despite the gains which have been made in efficiency, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) estimates that the canal will reach its maximum sustainable capacity between 2009 and 2012. The long-term solution for the congestion problems was the expansion of the canal through a new third set of locks. Work started in 2007 and the expanded canal enter commercial operation in June 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, <b>Post-Panamax</b> ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the current locks are capable of handling.|$|E

25|$|Currently {{the port}} {{is in the}} midst of a large scale {{expansion}} program. Completed in 2006, stage 1 of the program involved extending the main breakwater by 1150 meters and reclaiming 100 hectares which allowed the addition of 1700 meters of new operational quays capable of supporting Super <b>Post-Panamax</b> vessels.|$|E
25|$|The <b>post-panamax</b> cranes {{were first}} put into {{commercial}} use on 21 December 2011 with the offloading of five containers destined to Campamento Santiago in Salinas, Puerto Rico. The operation required {{the support of}} the Ponce Municipal Police Marine Unit, Fuerzas Unidas de Rapida Accion (United Forces for Fast Action, FURA), the Ponce Municipal Office for Emergency Management, the Puerto Rico Police, the Puerto Rico Fire Corps, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Puerto Rico National Guard, and POTA personnel.|$|E
25|$|The {{project is}} {{expected}} to create demand for ports to handle New Panamax ships. Several U.S. Eastern Seaboard ports {{will be ready for}} these larger ships, and others are considering renovations, including dredging, blasting, and bridge raising. In the UK, the Port of Southampton can handle <b>post-Panamax</b> vessels and is expanding to accommodate more; the Port of Liverpool was anticipated to be capable by 2015, although was delayed until mid-2016; and others are considering such expansion.|$|E
25|$|The Solstice {{class is}} {{a class of}} cruise ships {{primarily}} operated by Celebrity Cruises, a subsidiary of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. The class is constructed by Meyer Werft of Germany. At present, there are five active Solstice-class ships: the lead vessel of the class, Celebrity Solstice; the second ship of the class, Celebrity Equinox; and the third ship of the class, Celebrity Eclipse, which was delivered on 15 April 2010. The fourth ship, Celebrity Silhouette, sailed on her Maiden Voyage on 23 July 2011; and the fifth, Celebrity Reflection, was launched in August 2012. The first Solstice-class ship, Celebrity Solstice entered service in November 2008 and is the namesake of the class. All Solstice-class vessels have <b>post-Panamax</b> dimensions.|$|E
25|$|The first Solstice-class {{vessel was}} ordered in year 2005 at Meyer Werft, with one vessel {{as the first}} option. Later, option for second vessel was exercised. Meyer Werft reached several {{milestones}} in their career while building the Solstice-class. It was their first time to build 122,000-GT cruise ships having <b>post-Panamax</b> dimensions. By that time, the class were the largest cruise ships ever built at the facility. On February and July 2006, the second and the third vessel was ordered respectively. The order for {{the fourth and fifth}} ship followed in 2007 and 2008. The class consists of five ships, with expected delivery of one ship each year, from 2008 to 2012, at a total cost of USD 3.7 billion.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} current {{competitors}} of the Panama Canal are the US intermodal {{system and the}} Suez Canal. The main ports and merchandise distribution centers in these routes are investing in capacity, location, and maritime and land infrastructure to serve <b>post-Panamax</b> container ships and their larger cargo volumes. According to the ACP, the growing usage of such ships in transcontinental routes competing with the canal is irreversible. It was estimated that by 2011 approximately 37% of {{the capacity of the}} world's container ship fleet would consist of vessels that did not fit through the current canal, and a great part of this fleet could be used on routes that compete with Panama.|$|E
