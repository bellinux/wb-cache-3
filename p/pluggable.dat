25|$|Recent {{innovations}} in DWDM transport systems include <b>pluggable</b> and software-tunable transceiver modules capable of operating on 40 or 80 channels. This dramatically reduces {{the need for}} discrete spare <b>pluggable</b> modules, when a handful of <b>pluggable</b> devices can handle {{the full range of}} wavelengths.|$|E
25|$|Support for <b>pluggable</b> {{annotations}} (JSR 269).|$|E
25|$|The TLS {{encryption}} system is <b>pluggable,</b> allowing different TLS libraries {{to be easily}} substituted. GnuTLS is the default, and NSS is also supported. Some operating systems' ports, such as OpenBSD's, choose to use OpenSSL or LibreSSL by default instead.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pluggable</b> merge strategies: As {{part of its}} toolkit design, Git has a {{well-defined}} model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.|$|E
2500|$|An {{interesting}} and relatively recent development relating coarse WDM {{is the creation}} of GBIC and small form factor <b>pluggable</b> (SFP) transceivers utilizing standardized CWDM wavelengths. GBIC and SFP optics allow for something very close to a seamless upgrade in even legacy systems that support SFP interfaces. Thus, a legacy switch system can be easily [...] "converted" [...] to allow wavelength multiplexed transport over a fiber simply by judicious choice of transceiver wavelengths, combined with an inexpensive passive optical multiplexing device.|$|E
2500|$|Java SE 6 (December 11, 2006) â€“ Codename Mustang. It was bundled with a {{database}} manager and facilitates {{the use of}} scripting languages with the JVM (such as JavaScript using Mozilla's Rhino engine). As of this version, Sun replaced the name [...] "J2SE" [...] with Java SE and dropped the [...] ".0" [...] from the version number. Other major changes include support for <b>pluggable</b> annotations (JSR 269), many GUI improvements, including native UI enhancements to support {{the look and feel}} of Windows Vista, and improvements to the Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) & JVM Tool Interface for better monitoring and troubleshooting.|$|E

50|$|The {{computer}} contained 113 electronic {{tubes and}} 1450 diodes. The 113 electronic tubes were mounted on 34 etched circuit <b>pluggable</b> cards which also contain associated components. Although 34 <b>pluggable</b> cards were used, {{there were only}} 12 different types of such cards. Card-extenders were available to permit dynamic testing of all machine functions. 680 of the 1450 diodes were mounted on one <b>pluggable</b> logic board.|$|E
