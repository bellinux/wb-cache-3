50|$|<b>Protocooperation</b> {{is where}} two species {{interact}} with each other beneficially; they have no need to {{interact with each}} other - they interact purely for the gain that they receive from doing this. It is not at all necessary for <b>protocooperation</b> to occur; growth and survival is possible {{in the absence of the}} interaction. The interaction that occurs can be between different kingdoms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Protocooperation</b> {{can occur}} in birds. The Egyptian plover removes insect pests from the backs of buffalo, antelope, giraffes, and rhinos. The cattle egret in America as well does the same task of {{removing}} the unwanted insects and parasites.|$|E
50|$|<b>Protocooperation</b> {{is a form}} of mutualism, but the {{cooperating}} species do not depend on each other for survival. An example of <b>protocooperation</b> happens between soil bacteria or fungi, and the plants that occur growing in the soil. None of the species rely on the relationship for survival, but all of the fungi, bacteria and higher plants take part in shaping soil composition and fertility. Soil bacteria and fungi interrelate with each other, forming nutrients essential to the plants survival. The plants obtain nutrients from root nodules and decomposing organic substance. Plants benefit by getting essential mineral nutrients and carbon dioxide.The plants do not need these mineral nutrients but do help the plant grow even further.|$|E
50|$|The {{flowers of}} plants that are pollinated by insects and birds benefit from <b>protocooperation.</b> The plants, {{particularly}} those with large bright colourful flowers bearing nectar glands, experience cross pollination because of the insects activities. This is beneficial to the insect that has got the food supply of pollen and nectar required for its survival.|$|E
50|$|A further {{example of}} <b>protocooperation</b> is the {{connection}} between ants and aphids. The ant searches for food on trees and shrubs that are hosts to honeydew-secreting species such as aphids, mealybugs, and some scales. The ant gathers the sugary substance and takes it to its nest as food for its offspring. It {{has been known for}} the ant to stimulate the aphid to secrete honeydew straight into its mouth. Some ant species even look after the honeydew producers from natural predators. In areas where the ant inhabits the same ecosystem as the plant the plants normally suffer from a higher presence of aphids which is detrimental to the plant but not to the two species protocooperating.|$|E
50|$|In 1923, Allee {{began to}} write a series of papers entitled, Animal Aggregations. Eight years later, he {{published}} his findings in a book under the same name. The results of Clyde Allee’s research demonstrated {{the existence of an}} unconscious drive within species for fellow individuals of the same species. This research helped to prove that under crowding was detrimental to some animals. Allee’s research also helped to describe <b>protocooperation,</b> where two species interact with one another in a beneficial way that is not essential to the survival of either organism. It {{should also be noted that}} Allee’s biological basis of democracy arrived at a time when the future of world politics and human kind’s morality were in question themselves. As a Quaker, Allee was committed to world peace and this commitment anteceded his theory of sociality. Allee’s Quaker beliefs led to the development of his dedication to show how cooperation is essential in the natural world. This led to the development of The Allee effect.|$|E
30|$|There are {{different}} modes through which species interact producing positive, negative, or neutral effects. Positive interactions {{in a community}} are broadly classified into four types: <b>protocooperation,</b> mutualism, commensalism, and scavenging.|$|E
30|$|In particular, <b>protocooperation</b> is a {{positive}} interspecific interaction in which both partners are mutually benefitted and increase the chance of their survival. Between the two organisms, there is a perfect morphological interaction which generates a new species, which is cataloged, classified, and analyzed as a different species.|$|E

30|$|Complexities in the {{succession}} process, difficulties in managerialization, {{conflicts between the}} business-involved family members and the not business-involved ones, and confusion between the family wealth and the family business assets are all issues investigated by various authors to underline the pathological {{relations between the two}} integrated systems. A <b>protocooperation</b> process and a mutually advantageous influence for the two organisms are realized when conditions able to harmonize centrifugal-centripetal forces and match concentration-heterogeneity dimensions are satisfied.|$|E
30|$|Between {{the family}} and the business, not only an {{institutional}} overlapping exists, as explained by influential analytical models in the past (e.g., Landsberg 1983), but they are morphologically integrated. Each is the mirror of the other (Habbershon et al. 2006). They change and coevolve together, in a <b>protocooperation</b> interaction. The coexistence of the two organisms, family and business, not only generates positive effects, but {{it is also possible that}} negative results emerge, as stressed by different studies on family business (Miller and Le Breton-Miller 2006).|$|E
40|$|The Hymenoptera fauna {{associated}} to Solanum gilo was studied. There were 21 species of Hymenoptera from eight families. It was observed Homalotylus flaminus (Dalman, 1820) (Encyrtidae) parasiting the adults of Cycloneda sanguinea Linnaeus, 1763 (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) and Chalcididae parasiting caterpillars of Mechanitis pofymnia casabranca Haensch, 1905 (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae, Ithomiinae, Sthomiinae). Vespidae were observed preying both M. pofymnia casabranca and Diabrotica speciosa Germar, 1824 (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae) adults. Halictidae, Andrenidae and Anthophoridae, were observed visiting flowers and Trigona spinipes (Fabricius, 1793) (Apidae) attacking fruits and stem ápices. The most abundant Hymenoptera were Formicidae; Cremalogaster sp. and Camponotus rufipes (Fabricus, 1775) {{were observed in}} <b>protocooperation</b> relation with Homoptera, {{the main cause of}} plant mortality was Solenopsis saevissima (Smith, 1855).

40|$|A {{theoretical}} framework for protocooperative behavior in pelotons (groups of cyclists) is proposed. A threshold between cooperative and free-riding behaviors in pelotons is modeled, together comprising protocooperative behavior (different from <b>protocooperation).</b> Protocooperative behavior {{is a function}} of: 1. two or more cyclists coupled by drafting benefit, 2. cyclists' current power output or speed, and 3. cyclists' maximal sustainable outputs (MSO). Characteristics of protocooperative behavior include: 1. relatively low speed phase in which cyclists naturally pass each other and share highest-cost front positions, and 2. free-riding phase in which cyclists maintain speeds of those ahead, but cannot pass. Threshold for protocooperative behavior is equivalent to coefficient of drafting d, below which cooperative behavior occurs; above which free-riding occurs up to a second threshold when coupled cyclists diverge. These behaviors are also hypothesized to emerge in other biological systems involving energy savings mechanisms. Further, the tension between intra-group cooperation and inter-group competition is consistent with superorganism properties. Comment: 24 pages, 11 figures, 43 reference...|$|E
40|$|Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, used in yogurt starter cultures, {{are well}} known for their {{stability}} and <b>protocooperation</b> during their coexistence in milk. In this study, we show that a close interaction between the two species also {{takes place at the}} genetic level. We performed an in silico analysis, combining gene composition and gene transfer mechanism-associated features, and predicted horizontally transferred genes in both L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus. Putative horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events that have occurred between the two bacterial species include the transfer of exopolysaccharide (EPS) biosynthesis genes, transferred from S. thermophilus to L. bulgaricus, and the gene cluster cbs-cblB(cglB) -cysE for the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids, transferred from L. bulgaricus or Lactobacillus helveticus to S. thermophilus. The HGT event for the cbs-cblB(cglB) -cysE gene cluster was analyzed in detail, with respect to both evolutionary and functional aspects. It can be concluded that during the coexistence of both yogurt starter species in a milk environment, agonistic coevolution at the genetic level has probably been involved in the optimization of their combined growth and interactions...|$|E
40|$|Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (Lb. bulgaricus) is an {{important}} species of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) used for cheese and yogurt fermentation. The genome of Lb. bulgaricus 2038, an industrial strain mainly used for yogurt production, was completely sequenced and compared against the other two ATCC collection strains of the same subspecies. Specific physiological properties of strain 2038, such as lysine biosynthesis, formate production, aspartate-related carbon-skeleton intermediate metabolism, unique EPS synthesis and efficient DNA restriction/modification systems, are all {{different from those of}} the collection strains that might benefit the industrial production of yogurt. Other common features shared by Lb. bulgaricus strains, such as efficient <b>protocooperation</b> with Streptococcus thermophilus and lactate production as well as well-equipped stress tolerance mechanisms may account for it being selected originally for yogurt fermentation industry. Multiple lines of evidence suggested that Lb. bulgaricus 2038 was genetically closer to the common ancestor of the subspecies than the other two sequenced collection strains, probably due to a strict industrial maintenance process for strain 2038 that might have halted its genome decay and sustained a gene network suitable for large scale yogur...|$|E
40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} are {{a vital part}} of the fermented food industry and are the subject of much interest and research. Industry is especially interested in using modern molecular approaches to maintain and improve selected strains; several industrial uses could be improved by closer investigation, namely the <b>protocooperation</b> of S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus, the role of CRISPRs in phage resistance, and the utilization of prebiotic carbohydrates. Questions such as what genes and pathways are shared during milk fermentation between S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus, when and what genes are active during bacteriophage infection, and how and where does prebiotic carbohydrate utilization occur can be answered. By using microarrays, complete snapshot of gene expression during each of these conditions are generated and detailed expression profiles can be produced. By devising a screening system, the distribution of the phenotype of GOS fermentation over a wide array of lactic acid bacteria from Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, and S. thermophilus can be explored. Once this phenotypic distribution is generated, selected strains that are able to utilize GOS can be studied in detail to determine the mechanics of GOS fermentation. Answering these questions will add to the understanding of what factors are involved in successful fermentation and eventually be able to improve strain selection methods...|$|E
40|$|Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) is a {{representative}} of the group of lactic acid-producing bacteria, mainly known for its worldwide application in yogurt production. The genome sequence of this bacterium has been determined and shows the signs of ongoing specialization, with a substantial number of pseudogenes and incomplete metabolic pathways and relatively few regulatory functions. Several unique features of the L. bulgaricus genome support the hypothesis that the genome is in a phase of rapid evolution. (i) Exceptionally high numbers of rRNA and tRNA genes with regard to genome size may indicate that the L. bulgaricus genome has known a recent phase of important size reduction, in agreement with the observed high frequency of gene inactivation and elimination; (ii) a much higher GC content at codon position 3 than expected {{on the basis of the}} overall GC content suggests that the composition of the genome is evolving toward a higher GC content; and (iii) the presence of a 47. 5 -kbp inverted repeat in the replication termination region, an extremely rare feature in bacterial genomes, may be interpreted as a transient stage in genome evolution. The results indicate the adaptation of L. bulgaricus from a plant-associated habitat to the stable protein and lactose-rich milk environment through the loss of superfluous functions and <b>protocooperation</b> with Streptococcus thermophilus...|$|E
40|$|Understanding how {{temperature}} and water stress affect <b>protocooperation</b> between plants and beneficial rhizobacteria may enhance {{the efficacy of}} biocontrol agents in reducing plant diseases. However, {{little is known about}} the impact of these factors on biocontrol mechanisms and effectiveness, especially when provided by beneficial Bacillus spp. This work aimed to evaluate the influence of low/high temperature combined with a normal and reduced water regime on the interaction between Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain S 499 and plants, resulting in the induction of systemic resistance (ISR). A reduction in ISR level was observed when plants were subjected to stress before bacterization; however, root treatment with S 499 prior to stress exposure attenuated this negative effect. Colonization of S 499 during exposure to temperature/water stress allowed the three crops to conserve their overall ability to mount defense lines to a similar degree at all the temperatures tested. Further investigation revealed that relative production of surfactin by S 499 was clearly enhanced at low temperature, making it possible to counter-balance the negative effect on traits associated with rhizosphere fitness (colonization, motility, and biofilm formation) observed in vitro in cold conditions. This work thus represents a first step in deciphering the effect of high/low temperatures and/or drought on key plant-microorganism interactions culminating in ISR. © 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

40|$|Abstract This study {{provides}} the first {{contribution of the}} biology and life table of Aphis forbesi Weed, 1889 (Hemiptera: Aphididae), an important strawberry pest throughout the world. This species lives in the crown and leaf petioles of the plant. It is difficulty to rear this species in laboratory due to <b>protocooperation</b> with ants observed only in the field. We studied {{the life cycle of}} A. forbesi on the leaves of the Albion strawberry cultivar at 25 ± 2 °C, 60 ± 10 % relative humidity, and a 12 -h photophase. The experiment was randomised with 100 replicates. The parameters of the fertility life table were calculated using TabVida. In the population studied, 25 % and 46 % had four and three instars, respectively. A mean of 1. 43 nymphs per female per day was generated. The mean reproductive period was seven days and the mean longevity was 10 days. In every 11 days there is a generation of A. forbesi, where each female has the potential to generate between 6 to 9 individuals daily, increasing its population by 1. 2 times. The average life cycle was 16. 8 days. High viability observed in all instars and the resulting values of R 0, rm and &# 955; suggest that A. forbesi has the capacity to increase their numbers {{in a short period of}} time, while generating high populations in strawberry crops, requiring differential management...|$|E
40|$|In {{soil and}} root {{ecosystems}} the partitioning of carbon is ubiquitously affected by interactions with heterotrophic rhizosphere micro organisms, including the potentially mutually beneficial (+,+) arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. However, {{the existence and}} sustainable management of AM fungi is threatened by prolonged and or intensive disturbances of soil. Therefore this study set out to explore the relationships between plants, soil fungi and soil disturbance treatments. A containerised bioassay of maize seedlings {{was used to assess}} root inhabitation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi from samples of Manawatu silt loam pasture field soils, methods were adapted from Brundrett et al (1996). Development of a rapid method to visualise the AM fungal inhabited maize seedling roots was enhanced by an alternative light source on an Olympus SZIII dissection microscope. A 100 W-equivalent fluorescent light tube produced less heat, but provided approximately five-fold more illumination than the original 20 W Olympus incandescent light bulb. It was found that propagation of maize seedlings during mid to late winter and greenhouse environments with relatively limited light day-length and irradiance levels may have resulted in 'parasitic' (+,-) soil-fungal interactions, or reduced growth of maize seedling plant biomass. Soil fungal parasitism of plant growth was attributed to mutual competition (-,-) for carbon photosynthate resources shared between soil fungi and plant host symbionts. In addition, a Venn-diagram model is proposed with three entities depicting fungal and plant population interactions that include mutual costs and benefits derived from bidirectional exchange of mineral and carbon nutrients as follows; mutualism and <b>protocooperation</b> (+,+); neutralism (0, 0); and competition (-,-). Intersecting sets of these entities depict a three-way continuum of population interactions; parasitism or predation (+,-), and prey or host escape (-,+); amensalism (0,- or -, 0); and commensalism (0,+ or +, 0) ...|$|E
30|$|For the {{conventional}} cellular networks, dynamic switching off of BSs {{has been extensively}} studied in [11, 16, 21 - 26]. A solution proposed in [21] automatically switch off appropriate BSs or sectors, which become the compensation area needed to be covered through the tilting of antennas in the neighboring BSs. A novel energy-efficient cellular access network architecture {{based on the principle}} of ecological <b>protocooperation</b> was proposed in [22], which indicates that BSs can cooperatively and dynamically make intelligent decisions based on thresholds for switching between different power modes according to traffic conditions. Similarly, a transmission power increment is required for compensating the areas of switched off BSs. In contrast to these works, the use of coordinated multipoint for MBS switching off without transmission power adjustment from compensating neighboring BSs is presented in [23]. From a game theoretic perspective, the energy efficiency issues in multi-operator mobile networks was studied in [24], where cost-based functions are used to decide the best suitable BSs to remain active. This paper introduces the cost that has to be paid by an operator when its subscribers have to be served by another operator {{due to the fact that}} some BSs have been switched off. In [25], the authors proposed a practical switching on/off-based energy saving algorithm that can be realized distributively. The key principle of the algorithm was to switch off a BS one by one that minimally affect the network by using network impact, which takes into account the additional load increments brought to its neighboring BSs. Distance-based approaches have been developed in [11, 16]. In [11], the authors used two real datasets (i.e., temporal and spatial) to estimate the energy savings, and they used a greedy algorithm by sequentially switching off the BSs with the minimum distance to its nearest active BSs if the coverage is met. A dynamic switching on/off algorithm where the number of active BSs adapts to the network condition was proposed in [16], which was based on BS traffic load and the position of the associated UEs. This algorithm preferentially tests the BS with larger average distance to its associated UEs to be switched off one by one and terminates when UEs of a BS cannot be accepted by the neighboring BSs. In realistic networks, the distances among BSs in homogeneous cellular network can be easily acquired, but the position of UEs may not be easily and accurately acquired. Besides, the policy that the algorithm just stops when one BS fails to transfer its UEs does not seem reasonable as other BSs with larger average distance may be lowly loaded, thus also have the potential to be switched off. It is important to remark that in the previous works regarding homogeneous cellular network, the decision to switch off BSs was based on either the distance factor or the traffic. However, since we focus on switching off PBSs in Hetnets, the distance between PBS and PUE cannot be accurately or easily obtained due to various reasons, such as technology limits and designing principles. As in some cases, the network side is not aware of the UEs’ position, which is also the desire of the users. Moreover, in addition to the load, other factors such as UEs’ service rate, the historical blocking probability, and the interference conditions should also be considered. Although BS switching off is primarily designed to reduce network energy consumption, it should be noted that the various approaches must ensure that the QoS in the coverage area is not compromised at all times. Emphasizing on this concern, a progressive BS switching on/off technique has been implemented through the coordination of multiple surrounding BSs in [26], where the main finding shows that the duration of BS sleeping and waking up transients is very short, with no significant reduction of the energy savings achievable with sleep mode approaches.|$|E
