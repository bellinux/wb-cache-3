25|$|Various larger {{species of}} Coccinellidae attack {{caterpillars}} and other beetle larvae. Several genera feed on various insects or their eggs; for example, Coleomegilla species are significant predators {{of the eggs}} and larvae of moths such as species of Spodoptera and the Plutellidae. Larvae and eggs of ladybirds, either their own or of other species, can also be important food resources when alternative prey are scarce. As a family, the Coccinellidae used {{to be regarded as}} purely carnivorous, but they are now known to be far more omnivorous than previously thought, both as a family and in individual species; examination of gut contents of apparently specialist predators commonly yield residues of pollen and other plant materials. Besides the prey they favour, most predatory coccinellids include other items in their diets, including honeydew, <b>pollen,</b> <b>plant</b> sap, nectar, and various fungi. The significance of such nonprey items in their diets is still under investigation and discussion.|$|E

Reducing <b>pollen</b> host <b>plant</b> search time is crucial to out-compete other flower visitors and to reduce exposure to predators.
