50|$|The {{biological}} half-life or terminal half-life of a substance {{is the time}} it takes for a substance (for example a metabolite, drug, signalling molecule, radioactive nuclide, or other substance) to lose half of its pharmacologic, physiologic, or radiologic activity. Typically, this refers to the body's cleansing through the function of kidneys and liver in addition to excretion functions to eliminate a substance from the body. In a medical context, half-life may also describe {{the time it takes}} for the blood plasma concentration of a substance to halve (plasma half-life) its steady-state. The relationship between the biological and <b>plasma</b> <b>half-lives</b> of a substance can be complex depending on the substance in question, due to factors including accumulation in tissues (protein binding), active metabolites, and receptor interactions.|$|E
40|$|Background: Phytosterols in {{vegetable}} oil (VO) -based lipid emulsions (LE) likely contribute to parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC) in preterm infants. No characterization of <b>plasma</b> phytosterol <b>half-lives</b> {{has been done in}} very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants receiving parenteral nutrition (PN) with LE. Methods: In a prospective cohort study, 45 VLBW preterm infants who received PN underwent serial blood sample measurements of sitosterol (SITO), campesterol (CAMP), and stigmasterol (STIGM). <b>Plasma</b> phytosterol <b>half-lives</b> were calculated from the phytosterol concentrations-decay curves by using a single-compartment model. Results: After the stop of the intravenous LE, study infants had significantly lower plasma total CAMP, STIGM and SITO concentrations. The decay of plasma phytosterol concentrations was monoexponential. Half-life of plasma total CAMP, STIGM and SITO was 13. 5 ± 6. 9, 10. 3 ± 4. 5 and 10. 3 ± 4. 0 days, respectively. <b>Plasma</b> phytosterol <b>half-lives</b> did not correlate with gestational age, birth weight, cumulative phytosterol intakes and plasma conjugated bilirubin. Conclusion: VLBW preterm infants on PN with LE had rather long <b>plasma</b> phytosterol <b>half-lives</b> similar to hypercholesterolemic adults and phytosterolemic homozygotes patients. We speculate that the accumulation of phytosterols could contribute to their vulnerability to PNAC.

Shortening of the plasma antipyrine half-life occurred {{in all but one}} of these 16 normal, adult volunteers, but there was considerable variation in the extent of reduction which ranged from 0 to 69 %. Phenobarbital administration decreased individual variations in antipyrine metabolism as indicated by the smaller standard deviation of the <b>plasma</b> antipyrine <b>half-lives</b> after phenobarbital than observed initially and by the narrowed range of variation in <b>plasma</b> antipyrine <b>half-lives</b> from 2. 8 -fold initially to 1. 8 -fold after phenobarbital.

40|$|Chemical {{modification}} of proteins with polyethylene glycol (PEGylation) can increase <b>plasma</b> <b>half-lives,</b> stability, and therapeutic potency. To make a PEGylated recombinant immunotoxin with improved therapeutic properties, we prepared a mutant of anti-Tac(Fv) -PE 38 (LMB- 2), a recombinant immunotoxin {{composed of a}} single-chain Fv fragment of the anti-human Tac monoclonal antibody to the IL- 2 receptor α subunit fused to a 38 -kDa fragment of Pseudomonas exotoxin. For site-specific PEGylation of LMB- 2, one cysteine residue was introduced into the peptide connector (ASGCGPE) between the Fv and the toxin. This mutant LMB- 2 (cys 1 -LMB- 2), which retained full cytotoxic activity, was then site-specifically conjugated with 5 or 20 kDa of polyethylene glycol-maleimide. When compared with unmodified LMB- 2, both PEGylated immunotoxins showed similar cytotoxic activities in vitro but superior stability at 37 °C in mouse serum, a 5 - to 8 -fold increase in <b>plasma</b> <b>half-lives</b> in mice, and a 3 - to 4 -fold increase in antitumor activity.

40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} was the optimization, {{characterization}} {{and application of}} a new, innovative drug carrier system {{which can be used}} to target pharmaceuticals to diseased tissues and organs. In the present study, a non-covalent biotin-streptavidin coupling procedure for the preparation of pegylated immunoliposomes is presented which simplifies the attachment of targeting vectors to sterically stabilized liposomes. The OX 26 monoclonal antibody against the rat transferrin receptor was used as a targeting vector. Immunostaining experiments with the OX 26 monoclonal antibody followed by fluorescent confocal microscopy revealed immunofluorescence labeling of the transferrin receptor on muscle and on glioma cells. Uptake experiments with these cells demonstrated cellular uptake and accumulation of small molecules (daunomycin, fluorescent probes) or macromolecules such as fluorescent oligonucleotides, within an intracellular compartment. Cellular uptake of liposomal daunomycin by multidrug-resistant cells was dose- and time-dependent and was associated with a clear pharmacological (i. e. cytotoxic) effect. Cytotoxic effects of liposomal formulations of daunomycin, in contrast to the free drug, were apparent only after prolonged incubation periods being indicative of a slow intracellular unpacking and release of liposomal daunomycin. With respect to expression plasmids (i. e. gene targeting), only marginal levels of gene expression were observed in vitro. Pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution studies in the rat revealed a substantially increased <b>plasma</b> <b>half-live</b> of liposomal drug compared to free drug. Brain accumulation of daunomycin in OX 26 -immunoliposomes occurred in higher levels as compared to brain uptake of free daunomycin or daunomycin incorporated within pegylated liposomes or unspecific IgG 2 a isotype control immunoliposomes. Such OX 26 -mediated effects were not observed in other tissues such as spleen, liver, muscle or kidney. Our experiments indicate that immunoliposomes can be used to target small drug molecules as well as macromolecules, such as oligonucleotides and expression plasmids, to cells and tissues. These findings demonstrate that immunoliposomes are a versatile and promising tool for future drug development in regard to both, galenic and therapeutical research. For clinical administrations, a better understanding of cellular uptake and release mechanisms are needed...|$|R

The results from four patients who were on long-term (> or = 6 months) combination therapy with zidovudine and rifampin are presented. In all cases of combined use of zidovudine and rifampin, a lower area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and, consequently, a higher apparent clearance of zidovudine were found, compared with a reference population of zidovudine users. Patients had a low to normal maximum concentration of zidovudine in <b>plasma.</b> Elimination <b>half-lives</b> were normal {{in all but one}} patient. Zidovudine glucuronide concentrations were determined in three patients and three control subjects. The patients all had relatively higher peak plasma concentrations and higher AUCs of zidovudine glucuronide than the control subjects. In one patient, zidovudine and zidovudine glucuronide were also measured 2. 5 months after discontinuation of rifampin. The AUC of zidovudine increased by a factor of 2. These data are in agreement with an enzyme-inducing effect of rifampin on the glucuronidation of zidovudine.

However, using two biologic assays (mosquito transmission and in vitro asexual stage development), we demonstrate here that sera from volunteers treated with atovaquone/proguanil retained activity against Plasmodium falciparum up to 6 weeks after such treatment. This activity was due to atovaquone, as administration of this drug alone replicated the data obtained with the combination.

The {{purpose of}} these studies {{was to determine if}} a functionally insignificant ischemic insult, occurring prior to gentamicin administration, enhanced gentamicin nephrotoxicity. Bilateral renal pedical clamp studies demonstrated that 15 minutes of ischemia did not increase the plasma creatinine yet markedly enhanced gentamicin nephrotoxicity. Further studies, in uninephrectomized rats, demonstrated that following fifteen minutes of renal ischemia and four hours of reperfusion inulin clearance, FENa+ and cellular morphology were normal. This model, therefore, was used in all subsequent studies. While the plasma creatinine concentrations were normal 24 hours following 15 minutes of ischemia and only slightly increased following gentamicin administration (100 mg/kg, i. p.) gentamicin administered four hours following 15 minutes of renal ischemia resulted in significantly increased 24 -hour plasma creatinine values. Light microscopic quantitation of tissue injury, performed 24 hours following experimental manipulation, was notable for S 3 segment damage in the ischemia plus gentamicin group. This was not observed in either the ischemia group or the sham operated gentamicin group. Cortical gentamicin levels were elevated in the ischemia plus gentamicin group, despite similar <b>plasma</b> gentamicin <b>half-lives.</b> However, the elevation in cortical gentamicin levels was dissociated from the enhanced nephrotoxicity seen following mild ischemic injury.

Although the overall severity of hepatic necrosis was found to increase with the dose of paracetamol ingested, correlation was not sufficiently close to provide an accurate prognostic index in individuals. Severe hepatic damage was less likely if the patient had vomited or had a stomach wash-out within 6 hr of overdose. The plasma concentrations of paracetamol, measured at known times after overdose, distinguished those who developed hepatic dysfunction from those who did not, {{but there was a}} poor correlation, particularly in the first 6 hr after ingestion of tablets, between these values and the severity of ensuing liver damage. Estimates of early <b>plasma</b> paracetamol <b>half-lives</b> from three or more samples taken within 4 hr of admission showed that all patients developing moderate or severe liver damage had half-lives greater than 4 hr, but this was also the case in nearly one-third of those with minimal liver lesions only.

Circulating radio-activity was mostly restricted to the plasma compartment of blood. Mean peak plasma concentration of OLZ was 11 ng/ml, whereas that of radioactivity was 39 ng eq/ml. Mean <b>plasma</b> terminal elim-ination <b>half-lives</b> were 27 and 59 hr, respectively, for OLZ and total radioactivity. With the help of NMR and MS data, a major metab-olite of OLZ in humans was characterized as a novel tertiary N...|$|R
40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay {{was developed}} for the measurement of sheep digoxin-specific immunoglobulin G and Fab fragments. With the latter, two preparations were examined, one available commercially (Digibind, Wellcome) and one prepared by ourselves (DSFab). The assay exhibited a greater sensitivity towards immunoglobulin G compared with Digibind and DSFab, presumably because the Fab preparations lacked some of the sheep-specific antigens present on the whole antibody molecule. The assay was used subsequently to examine the disposition of the antibody preparations after injection of 1 mg/kg i. v. into anaesthetised bile duct-cannulated rats. The <b>plasma</b> distribution <b>half-lives</b> (1. 8 - 3. 3 min) were similar for all three preparations, but while plasma elimination half-life values for Digibind and DSFab were much the same (110 - 115 min), that for immunoglobulin G was longer (425 min). The shorter half-life values for Fab fragments were linked to a rate of urinary elimination 10 - 20 fold faster. No antibody excretion in the bile was detected. The apparent volume of distribution of immunoglobulin G was 35 ml/kg, indicating that the whole antibody was largely confined to the plasma space. The volume of distribution for Digibind or DSFab (about 46 ml/kg) was not significantly larger than that for immunoglobulin G and {{much smaller than the}} extracellular fluid volume, which was measured as 305 ml/kg. Thus the distribution of sheep Fab fragments in the rat markedly differs from that in the baboon (Smith et al., 1979) where the apparent volume of distribution approximates to the extracellular fluid volume...|$|R
