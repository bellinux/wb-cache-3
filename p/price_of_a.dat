5|$|A Book of the Dead papyrus was {{produced}} to order by scribes. They were commissioned {{by people in}} preparation for their own funeral, or by the relatives of someone recently deceased.

Papyrus itself was evidently costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. In one case, a Book of the Dead was written on second-hand papyrus.|$|E
5|$|At its U.S. debut, the {{redesigned}} LS 400 {{retained a}} pricing advantage over European competitors in its largest market, launching with a base price of US$51,000. However, cost differences had narrowed following more aggressive pricing and added feature content from rival manufacturers. To promote their new flagship, Lexus launched a US$50 million advertising campaign, {{the most expensive}} marketing effort since {{the launch of the}} division. In mid-1995, sales slowed as the U.S. government threatened tariffs on Japanese luxury cars over the widening U.S.-Japan trade deficit, potentially raising the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fully optioned LS 400 to over US$100,000. Subsequent negotiations averted the sanctions by the second quarter of that year, and sales recovered in the following months. Ultimately, second-generation LS 400 sales were not as voluminous as the original model; production totaled approximately 114,000 units.|$|E

5|$|Covered {{interest}} rate parity is a no-arbitrage condition in foreign exchange markets which {{depends on the}} availability of the forward market. It can be rearranged to give the forward exchange rate {{as a function of the}} other variables. The forward exchange rate depends on three known variables: the spot exchange rate, the domestic {{interest rate}}, and the foreign interest rate. This effectively means that the forward rate is the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> forward contract, which derives its value from the pricing of spot contracts and the addition of information on available interest rates.|$|E
5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes {{a decrease in the}} cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or <b>price)</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{contend that}} a risk parity portfolio requires strong management and continuous oversight {{to reduce the}} potential for negative consequences {{as a result of}} leverage and allocation building in the form of buying and selling of assets to keep dollar holdings at predetermined and equalized risk levels. For example, if the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> security goes up or down and risk levels remain the same, the risk parity portfolio will be adjusted to keep its dollar exposure constant. On the other hand, some consider risk parity to be a passive approach, because it does not require the portfolio manager to buy or sell securities on the basis of judgments about future market behavior.|$|E
