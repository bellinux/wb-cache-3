40|$|Due to the {{single-phase}} {{loads and}} their stochastic behavior, the current {{in the distribution}} feeders is not balanced. In addition, the single-phase loads are located in different positions along the LV feeders. So {{the amount of the}} unbalanced load and its location affect the feeder losses. An unbalanced load causes the feeder losses and the voltage drop. Because of time-varying behavior of the single-phase loads, <b>phase</b> <b>balancing</b> is a dynamic and combinatorial problem. In this research, a heuristic and dynamic solution for the <b>phase</b> <b>balancing</b> of the LV feeders is proposed. In this method, it is supposed that the loads’ tie could be connected to all phases through a three-phase switch. The aim of the proposed method is to make the feeder conditions as balanced as possible. The amount and the location of single-phase loads are considered in the proposed <b>phase</b> <b>balancing</b> method. Since the proposed method needs no communication interface or no remote controller, it is inexpensive, simple, practical, and robust.

40|$|The {{distribution}} system {{plays a key}} role in power system as it provides energy to the consumers safely, reliably, and economically. However, due to high R/X ratio, and low operating voltages, most of the losses occur in the {{distribution system}}. Moreover, distribution systems are generally unbalanced due to unequal single phase loads at the three phases of the system, and also additional unbalancing is introduced due to non-equilateral conductor spacing. This, causes the voltage, the current, and the power unbalance in the system. Further, the total neutral current of the system increases causing unwanted tripping of the relay. Hence, the service quality and the reliability of the distribution system reduces. Therefore, a suitable <b>phase</b> <b>balancing</b> strategy is required to mitigate the phase unbalancing in the unbalanced distribution systems. Also, apart from reducing the phase unbalancing in the unbalanced distribution systems, a suitable strategy is required to minimize the system power loss. In this regard, it is necessary for the distribution engineers to plan the unbalanced distribution systems in order to reduce the losses, voltage unbalances, and neutral current of the system for safe and reliable operation. Most of the approaches for the planning of the unbalanced distribution systems are based upon metaheuristic algorithms. Moreover, the recent research has focused only on either <b>phase</b> <b>balancing</b> or simultaneous <b>phase</b> <b>balancing</b> and conductor sizing optimization in unbalanced distribution systems using metaheuristic algorithms. However no work has been carried out to study the impact of the simultaneous optimization of the <b>phase</b> <b>balancing,</b> the conductor sizing, the capacitor location and sizing, the DG location and sizing, DSTATCOM location, and rating on system power loss, voltage unbalance, etc. utilizing these algorithms. As the metaheuristic algorithms are random in nature, the convergence is not guaranteed in a single simulation run. Hence, it is necessary to perform a statistical comparison among them in order to understand their relative merits and demerits for multiple simulation runs. In this thesis, the impact of the simultaneous optimization of the <b>phase</b> <b>balancing</b> and the conductor sizing on the planning problems/objective functions of the unbalanced distribution system such as; the power loss, the voltage unbalance, the total neutral current, and the complex power unbalance studied using various metaheuristic algorithms such as the DE, the CSA, the PSO, and the GA. In the first step, these objective functions are optimized separately; then they are aggregated with weights into a multi-objective optimization problem. Further, a performance comparison in terms of the mean value of the objective functions and standard deviation (SD) carried out. The reactive power compensating devices, such as the Capacitor, and the DSTATCOM has been integrated into the planning problem for the power loss minimization, the voltage profile improvement, and the voltage unbalance mitigation of the unbalanced distribution systems. Moreover, a three phase unbalanced modelling of the DSTATCOM has been developed.

40|$|Abstract: In power {{distribution}} systems, feeders frequently exhibit some imbalance between phases. Feeder imbalance {{occurs when the}} currents (Ia, Ib and Ic) of a three-phase system {{do not have the}} same magnitude at any load point along the feeder, because some phases are more heavily loaded than others. A state of imbalance in power systems may cause excessive voltage drops, unnecessary energy losses, and increased risk of feeder overload. It may also affect system power quality and electricity price. In order to correct this state of disproportion, <b>phase</b> <b>balancing</b> can be utilized. One solution to <b>phase</b> <b>balancing</b> is to swap single-phase loads from one phase to another to make the currents identical at each load point on the feeder. This technique is called phase swapping. Balancing loads in a distribution system can enhance utilities competitiveness by improving reliability and by reducing costs. The determination of the optimal swapping scheme is a non-linear problem. The efficiency of using Tabu Search to solve this non-linear <b>phase</b> <b>balancing</b> problem is demonstrated.
