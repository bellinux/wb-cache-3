5|$|In late 2013, Yankovic sued his label, Volcano, and {{its parent}} company Sony Music for unpaid {{publishing}} royalties from several of his albums and singles, including <b>Poodle</b> Hat. Yankovic claimed thatdespite the album's successhe never earned royalties from the record. The initial lawsuit was for $5 million; Yankovic won the lawsuit and was awarded an undisclosed sum of money from Sony.|$|E

5|$|Polka Party! was {{released}} October 21, 1986. After it {{was released}}, the album peaked at number 177 on the Billboard 200. Compared to Yankovic's previous albums—Dare to Be Stupid peaked at number 50 and In 3-D peaked at number 17—Polka Party! {{was a major}} commercial disappointment for the comedian. The album was the lowest-charting studio album released by Yankovic {{and is one of}} his few studio albums not to be certified either Gold or Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The others include the soundtrack to his film UHF (1989) and <b>Poodle</b> Hat (2003).|$|E

5000|$|In the 1990s, breeders in both North America and Australia began {{crossing}} Golden Retrievers with Standard <b>Poodles.</b> The {{original purpose}} of the cross was to attempt to develop guide dogs suitable for visually impaired individuals with allergies. The goldendoodle is sometimes called a designer dog. The Encyclopædia Britannica traces the term [...] "designer dog" [...] to the late 20th century, when breeders began to cross purebred <b>Poodles</b> with other purebred breeds {{in order to obtain}} a dog with the <b>poodle's</b> non-shedding coat, along with various desirable characteristics from other breeds.|$|R
5|$|<b>Poodle</b> Hat was {{released}} as an Enhanced CD, meaning {{that when the}} disc is placed in a computer, bonus content (including alternate song mixes, short videos, and photo galleries) are viewable. The album met with mixed reviews from critics; some felt that the album represented an artistic misstep for Yankovic, whereas others enjoyed its skewering of early 2000s popular culture. The album peaked at number 17 on the Billboard 200. The album also peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Comedy Albums chart, making it the first of Yankovic's records to earn a position on said chart.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} records surrounding {{development of}} the Standard Schnauzer in Germany come from the late 19th century. They were originally bred to be medium-sized farm dogs in Germany, equally suited to ratting, herding, and guarding property. As time passed, farmers bred the Standard Schnauzer into a smaller, more compact size for ratting by combining it with the Affenpinscher and Miniature <b>Poodle.</b> The first recorded Miniature Schnauzer appeared in 1888, and the first exhibition was held in 1899.|$|E
5|$|Developed in the United States, the American Water Spaniel is the Wisconsin state dog. The breed {{originated}} in the areas along the Fox River and its tributary the Wolf River during the early 19th century. Hunters needed a dog that could work on both land and water, a versatile hunter skilled at bringing {{in a variety of}} game. Hunters also wanted a hunting dog compact enough to be transported in a small skiff, one that was able to withstand Wisconsin's cold water temperatures. Breeds involved {{in the creation of the}} American Water Spaniel are thought to have included the English Water Spaniel, Irish Water Spaniel, Curly Coated Retriever, native Indian Dogs, the <b>Poodle,</b> and either the Sussex Spaniel or another type of field spaniel.|$|E

60|$|The Children's Hospital, {{to which}} I gave that name, {{is in full}} force. All its beds are occupied. There is a new face on the bed where my pretty baby lay, and that sweet little child is now at rest for ever. Much kind sympathy has been here since my former visit, and {{it is good to}} see the walls profusely garnished with dolls. I wonder what <b>Poodles</b> may think of them, as they stretch out their arms above the beds, and stare, and display their splendid dresses. <b>Poodles</b> has a greater {{interest}} in the patients. I find him making the round of the beds, like a house-surgeon, attended by another dog,--a friend,--who appears to trot about with him in the character of his pupil dresser. <b>Poodles</b> is anxious to make me known to a pretty little girl looking wonderfully healthy, who had had a leg taken off for cancer of the knee. A difficult operation, <b>Poodles</b> intimates, wagging his tail on the counterpane, but perfectly successful, as you see, dear sir! The patient, patting <b>Poodles,</b> adds with a smile, 'The leg was so much trouble to me, that I am glad it's gone.' I never saw anything in doggery finer than the deportment of <b>Poodles,</b> when another little girl opens her mouth to show a peculiar enlargement of the tongue. <b>Poodles</b> (at that time on a table, to be on a level with the occasion) looks at the tongue (with his own sympathetically out) so very gravely and knowingly, that I feel inclined to put my hand in my waistcoat-pocket, and give him a guinea, wrapped in paper.|$|R
5|$|UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff was {{released}} July 18, 1989. After it {{was released}}, the album peaked at number 146 on the Billboard 200. Much like Polka Party! (1986), {{the album was}} considered a major commercial disappointment for the comedian; the album is his second-lowest charting album after Polka Party! (1986). The UHF soundtrack {{is one of only}} a few of Yankovic's studio albums that is not certified either Gold or Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States. The others include Polka Party! and <b>Poodle</b> Hat (2003). UHF would also be Yankovic's last studio album to be released in the US on vinyl record until 2011's Alpocalypse.|$|E
5|$|Cardigan Welsh Corgis {{continued}} to be rarer than Pembrokes, with only 11 registrations made in the war year of 1940. Both breeds survived the Second World War, although the Cardigans registered with the Kennel Club numbered only 61 {{by the end of}} the war. Pembrokes became very popular during the post war years in the United Kingdom; in 1953 it was ranked as the fourth most popular breed by the Kennel Club, behind the English Cocker Spaniel, the German Shepherd and the Pekingese. In 1955, the reserve Best in Show at Crufts was the Pembroke Welsh Corgi Kaytop Maracas Mint, who was beaten by the Standard <b>Poodle</b> Ch. Tzigane Affri of Nashend. The Corgi breeds declined in popularity: veterinary physician Brian Singleton suggested in The Times in 1963 that this was due to issues with their temperament.|$|E
5|$|Paul Mansfield {{hoped the}} birth of their child would {{discourage}} her interest in acting. When it did not, he agreed to move to Los Angeles in late 1954 to help further her career. In 1952, she juggled motherhood and classes at the University of Texas. Early in 1952, Paul was called to the United States Army Reserve for the Korean War. While he served in the army, she spent a year at Camp Gordon, Georgia. Her life became easier with Paul's army allotment. Coming back from the Korean War in 1954, he took a job with a small newspaper in East Los Angeles, California, and lived in a small apartment in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, with Jayne and her pets— a Great Dane, three cats named Sabina, Romulus, and Ophelia, two chihuahuas, a <b>poodle</b> dyed pink, and a rabbit. While in California, she left Jayne Marie with her maternal grandparents and spent the summer semester at UCLA.|$|E

5|$|Rupert's {{imprisonment}} {{became more}} relaxed {{on the advice}} of the Archduke Leopold, Ferdinand's younger brother, who met and grew to like Rupert. Rupert practised etching, played tennis, practised shooting, read military textbooks and was taken on accompanied hunting trips. He also entered into a romantic affair with Susan Kuffstein, the daughter of Count von Kuffstein, his gaoler. He received a present of a rare white <b>poodle</b> that Rupert called Boy, or sometimes Pudel, and which remained with him into the English Civil War. Despite attempts by a Franco-Swedish army to seize Linz and free Rupert, his release was ultimately negotiated through Leopold and the Empress Maria Anna; in exchange for a commitment never again to take up arms against the Emperor, Rupert would be released. Rupert formally kissed the Emperor's hand at the end of 1641, turned down a final offer of an Imperial command and left Germany for England.|$|E

Pet clips are much less elaborate than show and require much less maintenance. A pet owner can anticipate grooming a <b>poodle</b> every six to eight weeks.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{retrospective}} study was to report the occurrence of lateral patellar luxation in <b>poodles.</b> The animals were referred to the Orthopedics Service of the Veterinary Hospital, Faculdade de Ciências Agrárias e Veterinárias, - Jaboticabal Campus, São Paulo, Brazil, twelve client-owned <b>poodles,</b> seven females and five males <b>poodles</b> {{ranging in age from}} three to nine months. Clinical examination showed lameness, pain and deformities of the affected limbs. Surgical trochleoplasties were performed with medial retinacular overlap and medial tibial tuberosity transposition. The animals recovered their normal activity within a period of one to two weeks after surgery. Although this was a rarely occurring pathological condition in <b>poodles,</b> surgical repair was easy to execute because of its similarity to correction of medial patellar luxation. Lateral patellar luxation in small dogs is rare and, when present, is of congenital origin, at times progressing to marked functional impotence of the affected limbs...|$|R
