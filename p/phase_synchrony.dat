In an effort to combat this fault, Ernest Wever and Charles Bray, in 1930, proposed the volley theory, claiming that multiple neurons could fire in a volley to later combine and equal the frequency of the original sound stimulus. Through more research, it was determined that because <b>phase</b> <b>synchrony</b> is only accurate up to about 1000 Hz, volley theory cannot account for all frequencies at which we hear.|$|E

40|$|Phase {{synchronization}} {{analysis of}} electroencephalogram (EEG) and its Independent Components (IC) are presently being explored {{in the context}} of seizure onset prediction in epilepsy. The theory of phase synchronization analysis has been based on narrowband data and it is usually extended for use on broadband data, which may not be correct. This raises doubts about the applicability and interpretation of results of phase synchronization analysis on EEG signals or their ICs, which may be broadband signals. The current work shows that using phase synchronization analysis on broadband data may fail to gauge the changes in phase synchronization occurring only in specific frequency bands, as broadband phase synchronization has been observed to show an averaging effect of narrow band <b>phase</b> <b>synchronies.</b> This concept has been assessed {{in the context of}} seizure onset detection and prediction, where phase synchronization analysis in narrow band is found to be better performed than broadband analysis, in showing the trend of increasing or decreasing synchronization at seizure onset near epileptogenic area. This information is not always found to be consistent in analysis with the raw EEG signals, which may show spurious synchronization happening mainly due to volume conduction effects. Independent Component Analysis has been used to decompose the EEG into underlying least dependent sources, which in effect also removes the effect of volume conduction that is inherent in the scalp EEG. The analytical approach using the Hilbert Transform has been used for phase synchronisation analysis along with the Phase Locking Statistic (i. e. a measure of statistically significant phase synchronization). These observations lead us to believe that tracking changes in phase synchronization of narrow band activity, on ICs of continuous EEG data records will be of great value in the context of seizure prediction...|$|R

The role of endorphins in vigorous synchronous activities (Cohen, Ejsmond-Frey, Knight, & Dunbar, 2010) may underlie these effects as endorphins have been implicated in social bonding (Dunbar & Shultz, 2010). Although research on synchronous behaviour has noted that there are two dominant phases of synchrony: in-phase and anti-phase (Marsh, Richardson, Baron, & Schmidt, 2006), research on the effect of synchrony on endorphins has only incorporated in-phase synchrony. The current study examined whether both <b>phases</b> of <b>synchrony</b> would generate the synchrony effect. Twenty-two participants rowed under three counterbalanced conditions - alone, in-phase synchrony and anti-phase synchrony.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to estimate the <b>phase</b> <b>synchrony</b> among nonstationary multivariate signals using the linear relationships between their instantaneous frequency (IF) laws. For cases where nonstationary signals are multi-component, a decomposition method like multi-channel empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) is used to simultaneously decompose the multi-channel signals into their intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). We then apply the Johansen method on the IF laws to assess the <b>phase</b> <b>synchrony</b> within multivariate nonstationary signals. The proposed approach is validated first using multichannel synthetic signals. The method is then used for quantifying the inter-hemispheric EEG asynchrony during ictal and inter-ictal periods using a newborn EEG seizure/non-seizure database of five subjects. For this application, pair-wise <b>phase</b> <b>synchrony</b> measures {{may not be able to}} account for phase interactions between multiple channels.

40|$|Abstract—High-frequency oscillatory {{potentials}} (HFOPs) in the vertebrate retina are stimulus specific. The {{phases of}} HFOPs recorded {{at any given}} retinal location drift randomly over time, but regions activated by the same stimulus tend to remain phase locked with approximately zero lag, whereas regions activated by spatially separate stimuli are typically uncorrelated. Based on retinal anatomy, we previously postulated that HFOPs are mediated by feedback from a class of axon-bearing amacrine cells that receive excitation from neighboring ganglion cells-via gap junctions-and make inhibitory synapses back onto the sur-rounding ganglion cells. Using a computer model, we show here that such circuitry can account for the stimulus specificity of HFOPs in response to both high- and low-contrast features. Phase locking between pairs of model ganglion cells did not depend critically on their separation distance, but on whether the applied stimulus created a continuous path between them. The degree of phase locking between spatially separate stimuli was reduced by lateral inhibition, which created a buffer zone around strongly ac-tivated regions. Stimulating the inhibited region between spatially separate stimuli increased their degree of phase locking propor-tionately. Our results suggest several experimental strategies for testing the hypothesis that stimulus-specific HFOPs arise from axon-mediated feedback in the inner retina.

5000|$|Although {{anatomical}} {{details of}} CPGs are specifically known {{in only a}} few cases, they have been shown to originate from the spinal cords of various vertebrates and to depend on relatively small and autonomous neural networks (rather than the entire nervous system) to generate rhythmic patterns. Many studies have been done to determine the neural substrate of locomotor CPGs in mammals. Neural rhythmicity can arise in two ways: [...] "through interactions among neurons (network-based rhythmicity) or through interactions among currents in individual neurons (endogenous oscillator neurons)". A key to understanding rhythm generation is the concept of a half-center oscillator (HCO). A half-center oscillator consists of two neurons that have no rhythmogenic ability individually, but produce rhythmic outputs when reciprocally coupled. Half-center oscillators can function in a variety of ways. First, the two neurons may not necessarily fire in antiphase and can fire in any relative <b>phasing,</b> even <b>synchrony,</b> depending on the synaptic release. Second, half-centers can also function in an [...] "escape" [...] mode or a [...] "release" [...] mode.

In particular, collective oscillations emerging from the synchronized activity of thousands of neurons can increase the functional connectivity between neural assemblies by coherently coordinating their <b>phases.</b> This <b>synchrony</b> of neuronal activity can take place within a cortical patch or between different cortical regions. While short-range interactions between neurons involve just a few milliseconds, communication through long-range projections between different regions could take up to tens of milliseconds.

To address this question, we have studied the dynamics of two bidirectionally delayed-coupled neuronal populations using conductance-based spiking models, examining how different synaptic delays give rise to in-phase/anti-phase transitions at particular frequencies within the gamma range, and how this behavior is related to the phase coherence between the two populations at different frequencies.

For different transmission delays between the two coupled populations, we analyze how the local field potential and multi-unit activity calculated from one population convey information in response to a set of external inputs applied to the other population.

40|$|This thesis {{promotes}} an interface {{inquiry into}} how classifiers are parameterized in Chinese, {{which is scheduled}} into a four-phased program. Phase I (classifier and mathematics) presents a multiplication-based parametric analysis to derive the rise of classifiers and the origin of their numerical value by asking why and how the sortal classifier has picked up the value of one. This numerical value will {{be incorporated into the}} multiplication formula to parameterize how modern dialects, such as Cantonese and Mandarin, vary against the syntax and semantics of classifiers. Phase II (abstract syntax and semantics) presents the tremendous consequence due to the mathematics interface as an arena for parametric selection. CL-raising is seen as the need to satisfy these mathematics interface conditions. So the choice of this syntactic mechanism by a dialect but not by the other dialect is motivated by the mathematics - syntax mapping. Phase III (surface syntax and semantics) brings the effect of the abstract syntactic operation to the surface by realizing it as a clustering pattern that differentiates Cantonese and Mandarin. For example, while Cantonese has the sequence X-CL-N, Mandarin does not. Furthermore, the dialectal parameterization may not simply rest on the syntactic level, but simultaneously hook on the semantic side. From the semantic point of view, the structure X-CL-N denotes definite and unity interpretations. The abstract syntax simultaneously affects the classifier performance on surface syntax and semantics. <b>Phase</b> IV (<b>synchrony</b> and diachrony) turns the scene to the ancient times of Chinese when the parametric analysis is subject to the evaluation against historical data. Across the synchronic - diachronic interface, if the analysis is adequate enough, it should predict the developmental stages of the syntactic properties of classifiers in the history of Chinese...|$|R
