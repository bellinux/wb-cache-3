40|$|Abstract ： In this paper, a new corona <b>protection</b> <b>varnish</b> was {{prepared}} by using epoxy/montmorillonite nano-composite and pure epoxy resin as adhesive respectively. The adhesive with different amounts of organic montmorillonite（OMMT）was mixed with 1200 mesh silicon carbide (SiC) by different weight ratios. The surface {{states of the}} varnishes with various adhesive were observed by powerful light microscope. Some properties of the varnishes were analyzed under DC, such as the relation of change in nonlinear coefficient and natural surface resistivity. The {{results showed that the}} amounts of OMMT had little effect on the natural surface resistance of the varnish but it had important influence on the nonlinear property of the varnish. When the range of the OMMT content was 2 wt % to 6 wt%, the nonlinear coefficient of all materials with epoxy/OMMT nano-composite adhesive was higher than that with pure epoxy resin adhesive...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{microhardness}} of 5 glass ionomer cements (GIC) - Vidrion R (V, SS White), Fuji IX (F, GC Corp.), Magic Glass ART (MG, Vigodent), Maxxion R (MR, FGM) and ChemFlex (CF, Dentsply) - in the presence or absence of a surface protection treatment, and after different storage periods. For each GIC, 36 test specimens were made, divided into 3 groups according to the surface protection treatment applied - no <b>protection,</b> <b>varnish</b> or nail varnish. The specimens were stored in distilled water for 24 h, 7 and 30 days and the microhardness tests were performed at these times. The data obtained were submitted to the ANOVA for repeated measures and Tukey tests (&# 945; = 5 %). The results revealed that the mean microhardness values of the GICs were, in decreasing order, as follows: F > CF = MR > MG > V; that surface protection was significant for MR, at 24 h, without protection (64. 2 ± 3. 6 a), protected with GIC varnish (59. 6 ± 3. 4 b) and protected with nail varnish (62. 7 ± 2. 8 ab); for F, at 7 days, without protection (97. 8 ± 3. 7 ab), protected with varnish (95. 9 ± 3. 2 b) and protected with nail varnish (100. 8 ± 3. 4 a); and at 30 days, for F, without protection (98. 8 ± 2. 6 b), protected with varnish (103. 3 ± 4. 4 a) and protected with nail varnish (101 ± 4. 1 ab) and, for V, without protection (46 ± 1. 3 b), protected with varnish (49. 6 ± 1. 7 ab) and protected with nail varnish (51. 1 ± 2. 6 a). The increase in storage time produced an increase in microhardness. It was concluded that the different GICs, surface protection treatments and storage times could alter the microhardness values...|$|E
40|$|Fluoride mouth rinses and {{fluoride}} toothpastes used {{regularly at}} home {{reduce the incidence}} of dental caries about 25 %. (SOR A, based on systematic reviews of RCTs.) Professionally applied fluoride varnishes reduce carries by about 50 %. (SOR A, based on systematic reviews of RCTs.) Pit and fissure sealants provide additional <b>protection</b> beyond fluoride <b>varnishes.</b> (SOR B, based on a meta-analysis with a small number of patients. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} of the authors was to evaluate fluoride release of 3 glass ionomer cements with immediate <b>protection</b> of fluoride <b>varnish</b> (Cavitine, SS White), divided into 3 groups: Group M (Meron, VOCO), Group V (Vidrion C, SS White) and Group KC (Ketac-Cem, 3 M ESPE). METHODS: Fluoride release was measured during 60 days {{by means of an}} ion-selective electrode connected to an ion analyzer. After 4 weeks, the test specimens were exposed to a solution of 0. 221 % sodium fluoride (1000 ppm of fluoride). RESULTS: Results showed that the cements reached a maximum peak of fluoride release in a period of 24 h. There was a statistically significant difference between the amount of fluoride released after the applications of fluoride among the groups from the 31 st to 60 th day (p> 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The Vidrion C and Meron cements showed better performance to uptake and release fluoride when compared with Ketac-Cem cement...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} restore the {{original}} aesthetic aspect, to improve {{the state of the}} age patina and of the gold halo, similar processes are required. The cleaning process {{is one of the most}} important aspects for an artwork and is considering a series of deteriorations and degradations, like dirt deposits (clogged or unclogged) opalescent varnish, colors blackening, burns, blisters, gaps (missing ground, painting layer or varnish). This step in the restoration process includes physical and mechanical proceedings like dusting (with a vacuum), brushing (with a brush), scraping (with a scalpel), removal or polishing etc. The scalpel and the milling process are rough unconventional means that are used only in exceptional cases. The wet cleaning of dirt includes classic washing processes, with water or other complex systems of organic solvents (emollients, surface additives or surfactants, mixtures of solvents). Cleaning the clogged dirt deposits with unconventional methods can be done by means of electronic laser, ion and thermal exchange or ultrasounds. Laser cleaning is often used in removing unwanted dirt deposits from different layers of the art piece. A lot of attention goes towards the controlled elimination of the exterior <b>protection</b> layer (<b>varnish),</b> which can be photo- degraded and oxidized by atmospheric exposure. Visual analysis, with enlargers (OM, SEM, AFM etc.) combined with transmission or penetration techniques (radiography, endoscopy, X-ray diffraction etc.) provides information on the superficial structures of the art work. In order to determine the modifications of the desiccant oils, SEM was used to observed the changes in the morphology of the oil painting layers. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) can be used to detrmine detergent residues on the painting layer...|$|R
