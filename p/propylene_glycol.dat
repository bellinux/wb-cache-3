5|$|De-icers spray heated {{de-icing}} fluid, often <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> or ethylene glycol, onto icy surfaces such as {{the bodies}} of aircraft and road surfaces. These prevent ice from forming {{on the body of}} the aircraft while on the ground. Ice makes the surface of the wings rougher, reducing the amount of lift they provide while increasing drag. The ice also increases the weight of the aircraft and can affect its balance.|$|E

Airports that discharge the collected aircraft deicing fluid directly to waters of the U.S. must also meet numeric discharge requirements for chemical oxygen demand. A report in 2000 stated that ethylene glycol was becoming less popular for aircraft deicing in the U.S., due to its reporting requirements and adverse environmental impacts (p.213), and noted a shift to the use of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> (p.I-3).|$|E

The melting temperatures of the PEEAs decreased with increasing {{length of the}} glycols. The ethylene glycols have higher melting temperatures than the 1, 2 / 1, 3 -propylene glycols. The undercooling for these polymers determined at 20 °C min− 1 was low (20 – 35 °C), suggesting a very high rate of crystallisation of the copolymers. Injection moulded samples were analysed with dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. The glass transition temperature for the ethylenediol polymer was 122 °C and the Tg decreased with increasing glycol length to 42 °C for the tetraethylene glycol. The Tg/Tm ratio for these polymers was high (0. 69 – 0. 70). The dimensional stability of these copolymers above the Tg was high. The diethylene glycol PEEA had a melting temperature of 262 °C, a glass transition temperature of 103 °C, a shear modulus at 150 °C of 180 MF'a, an undercooling of 28 °C, a stress at break of 65 MPa and a modulus of 2. 9 GPa...|$|R

5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} acute management of seizures. Long-term use {{for the management of}} epilepsy is not recommended due to the significant risk of tolerance (which renders midazolam and other benzodiazepines ineffective) and the significant side effect of sedation. A benefit of midazolam is that in children it can be administered buccally or intranasally at home or at school for emergency control of acute seizures, including status epilepticus. Midazolam is effective for status epilepticus that has not improved following other treatments or when intravenous access cannot be obtained, and has advantages of being water-soluble, having a rapid onset of action and not causing metabolic acidosis from the <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> vehicle, which occurs with other benzodiazepines. Drawbacks include a high degree of breakthrough seizures—due to the short half-life of midazolam—in over 50% of people treated, as well as treatment failure in 14–18% of people with refractory status epilepticus. Tolerance develops rapidly to the anticonvulsant effect, and the dose may need to be increased by several times to maintain anticonvulsant therapeutic effects. With prolonged use, tolerance and tachyphylaxis can occur and the elimination half-life may increase, up to days. There is evidence buccal and intranasal midazolam is easier to administer and more effective than rectally administered diazepam in the emergency control of seizures.|$|E

The single cell with prepared MEA is measured by linear scanning voltammetry to evaluate the discharge characteristics, by cyclic voltammetry to evaluate catalyst utilization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to evaluate internal resistance.

Due to its segmented structure, polyurethane’s {{with a wide}} range of physico-mechanical properties can be obtained by varying its monomers types and content. In this paper, the effect of different soft segment length on influencing the structure property relationship of polyurethane prepolymer was studied. The soft segment length was varied by using poly (<b>propylene</b> oxide) <b>glycol</b> having different molecular weight and also by blending two polyols having similar chemical composition but of different molecular weight. The formation of the prepolymer was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results reveal that with increasing soft segment length, the weight average molecular weight and storage time of the prepolymer increases, whereas the Brookfield viscosity decreases due to higher content of soft segment. The curing time was found higher in prepolymer having longer soft segments due to lower isocyanate content. With increasing molecular weight of the soft segment, the phase separation between the hard and soft segment increases due to which the prepolymer produce low Tg. The tensile strength of the polyurethane film decreases whereas percent elongation increases with increase in soft segment length.

40|$|A novel {{process for}} glycol {{production}} provides {{the potential for}} industrial scale consumption of glycerol which is the unwanted by-product from bio-diesel processing. There are many pressures encouraging process developers to reduce the use of fossil hydrocarbon sources in production of bulk chemicals. Among the most prominent are increased and fluctuating feedstock prices, the drive to renewable resources and legislation for reduction of emissions. On {{the other side of}} the equation, the adoption of genetic engineering is already opening up possibilities to either increase crop yields or enable production of specific intermediates from carbohydrates through the manipulation of crops and organisms. Davy Process Technology recognised this potential some time ago, illustrated by the commercialisation of its ethyl acetate process that is based solely upon ethanol which may be produced by fermentation of natural sugars.

Release of ambroxol according to concentration and temperature was determined, and permeation of drug through rat skin was studied using two chamber-diffusion cells. The solubility according to PEG 400 volume fraction was highest at 40 % PEG 400. The rate of drug release from the EVA matrix increased with increased temperature and drug loading doses. A linear relationship existed between the release rate and the square root of loading rate. The activation energy (Ea) was measured from {{the slope of the}} plot of log P versus 1000 /T and was found to be 10. 71, 10. 39, 10. 33 and 9. 87 kcal/mol for 2, 3, 4 and 5 % loading dose from the EVA matrix, respectively. To increase the permeation rate of ambroxol across rat skin from the EVA matrix, various penetration enhancers such as fatty acids (saturated, unsaturated), <b>propylene</b> <b>glycols,</b> glycerides, pyrrolidones, and non-ionic surfactants were used.

Based on the results, a generalised gel formation diagram for MC in glycols is presented and compared with aqueous MC gel formation. The results showed that MC forms gels in glycols upon cooling and the temperatures of gel formation/melting are different for each glycol.

40|$|ABSTRACT DETERMINATION OF DESCRIPTORS BY LIQUID-LIQUID PARTITION AND CHROMATOGRAPHIC METHODS by THUSHARA KARUNASEKARA September 2012 Advisor: Prof. Colin F. Poole Major: Chemistry (Analytical) Degree: Doctor of Philosophy Partition {{coefficients}} for varied compounds were determined for several totally organic biphasic systems using formamide, <b>propylene</b> carbonate, ethylene <b>glycol</b> or dimethyl sulfoxide {{as the base}} solvent and n-heptane, 1, 2 -dichloroethane, 1 -octanol or isopentyl ether as the counter solvent. These partition coefficient databases are analyzed using the solvation parameter model facilitating a quantitative comparison of these systems with other totally organic and water-based partition systems. These totally organic biphasic solvent systems offer a complementary approach to water-based partition systems for sample preparation and the determination of descriptors for compounds virtually insoluble in water or unstable in water. A new method of solvent classification is proposed based on the five system constants of the solvation parameter model for transfer of neutral compounds from the gas phase to solvent and hierarchical cluster analysis for identifying solvents with similar properties and for organizing them into selectivity groups. This method resulted in the classification of 36 common solvents used in chromatography into seven selectivity groups with four solvents (2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethanol, N,N-dimethylformaide, dimethyl sulfoxide and water) behaving independently. The classification scheme provides a logical approach for solvent selection {{as the first step}} in chromatographic method development. A similar approach for the transfer of neutral compounds between condensed phases and hierarchical cluster analysis was used to classify 19 aqueous and 17 totally organic biphasic partition systems for liquid-liquid extraction. The totally organic biphasic partition systems exhibit an almost continuous range of properties with minimal group formation demonstrating a wider and complementary range of selectivity to the aqueous biphasic systems. The classification of the liquid-liquid partition systems provides a suitable method of identifying suitable systems for sample preparation based on liquid-liquid extraction and for the simulation of extractions for target compound isolation. Retention factors on a minimum of eight stationary phases at various temperatures by gas-liquid chromatography and liquid-liquid partition {{coefficients for}} eight totally organic biphasic systems were combined to estimate descriptors for 28 fragrance compounds with an emphasis on compounds that are known or potential allergens. Similar aproch with additional liquid chromatographic measurements was used to estimate descriptors for 24 esters widely used as plasticizers and solvents in industry. The descriptors facilitated the estimation of several properties of biological and environmental interest (sensory irritation threshold, odor detection threshold, nasal pungency threshold, skin permeability from water, skin-water partition coefficients, octanol-water partition coefficients, absorption by air particles, adsorption by diesel soot particles, air-water partition coefficients, and adsorption by film water). A combination of gas chromatography and liquid-liquid partition in totally organic biphasic systems is used to determine descriptor values for compounds of low volatility suitable for characterizing open tubular columns at high temperatures. The descriptor database of varied compounds includes several difficult to determine by conventional techniques due to their low water solubility or stability. The descriptor database facilitates an expansion of the descriptor space and compound variation for characterizing separation systems. As an application the descriptor database is used to determine the system constants for SPB-Octyl, HP- 5, Rxi- 5 Sil MS, Rtx- 440, and Rtx-OPP for the temperature range 200 - 300,,aC. As an example of the broader affect of temperature on column selectivity the variation of the system constants for Rtx- 440 over the temperature range 60 - 300,,aC is described in detail. These studies demonstrate the persistence of polar interactions to the highest temperature studied and that at high temperatures selectivity differences persist for moderately polar stationary phases...|$|R

25|$|Early {{engine coolant}} {{antifreeze}} was methanol (methyl alcohol). Methanol was {{widely used in}} windshield fluids, however, in Europe, due to new REACH legislation, the use of methanol in windshield fluids is limited to 5% and {{in the near future}} will be further reduced to 3%. As radiator caps were vented, not sealed, the methanol was lost to evaporation, requiring frequent replenishment to avoid freezing of the coolant. Methanol also accelerates corrosion of the metals, especially aluminum, used in the engine and cooling systems. Ethylene glycol was developed, and soon replaced methanol as an engine cooling system antifreeze. It has a very low volatility compared to methanol and to water. Before the 1950s, coolant systems were unpressurized and the engine was often cooler than modern automotive engines. By pressurizing the coolant system with a radiator cap, the boiling point of the fluid is increased, permitting higher engine temperatures and better fuel efficiency. Pressurized systems do not appreciably change the freezing point. Later <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> was introduced due to its environmental credentials.|$|E
25|$|However acetyl-CoA can be {{converted}} to acetoacetate, which can decarboxylate to acetone (either spontaneously, or by acetoacetate decarboxylase). It can then be further metabolized to isopropanol which is excreted in breath/urine, or by CYP2E1 into hydroxyacetone (acetol). Acetol can {{be converted}} to <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> This converts to formate and acetate (the latter converting to glucose), or pyruvate (by two alternative enzymes), or propionaldehyde, or to L-lactaldehyde then L-lactate (the common lactate isomer). Another pathway turns acetol to methylglyoxal, then to pyruvate, or to D-lactaldehyde (via S-D-lactoyl-glutathione or otherwise) then D-lactate. D-lactate metabolism (to glucose) is slow or impaired in humans, so most of the D-lactate is excreted in the urine; thus D-lactate derived from acetone can contribute significantly to the metabolic acidosis associated with ketosis or isopropanol intoxication. L-Lactate can complete the net conversion of fatty acids into glucose. The first experiment to show conversion of acetone to glucose was carried out in 1951. This, and further experiments used carbon isotopic labelling. Up to 11% of the glucose can be derived from acetone during starvation in humans.|$|E
