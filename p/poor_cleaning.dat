40|$|Abstract: Complex {{structural}} wells {{are widely}} used {{in the development of}} marine oilfields, old oilfield sand low permeable oilfields. However, <b>poor</b> hole <b>cleaning</b> often occurred in the highly-deviated sections and horizontal sections of the complex structural wells, which affects rate of penetration, cementing quality and downhole safety. It is advisable to study the behavior of cuttings transport under different conditions. In general, experimental observations and CFD simulations are main methods to analyze the effects of cutting parameters, fluid parameters and operational parameters on hole cleaning. The correlations and models are applied to predict the number of cuttings and the critical velocity in the annulus. In this paper, an analysis of key parameters is conducted on cuttings transport, the existing problems and characteristics of these correlations and models are summarized,, and different removal methods of annular cuttings and future research needs are discussed. Although major improvements have been achieved in the past several decades, how to accurately predict the cuttings bed height, critical velocity and other key parameters, and to effectively solve the <b>poor</b> hole <b>cleaning</b> still is a difficulty challenge. Therefore, more research will be conducted to further understand cuttings transport mechanism in multi-factors coupling and complex wellbore conditions...|$|R
40|$|This {{in vitro}} study {{assessed}} the cleaning efficacy of different electric toothbrushes around upper incisor brackets. Standard and Mini Diamond™ brackets were fixed on black-stained teeth. The teeth were coated with white titanium oxide and brushed in a machine twice for 1 minute each. Twelve different brush heads {{with either a}} wiping or an oscillating-rotating action were tested. After brushing, the teeth were scanned, the black surfaces were assessed planimetrically and a modified plaque index for orthodontic patients (PIOP) was introduced. Tooth areas, which were black again after brushing indicated tooth surface contact of the filaments and were expressed {{as a percentage of}} total area. The remaining white areas around the brackets indicated 'plaque-retentive' niches. Analysis of variance was used for individual comparison of the brush types. Bonferroni/Dunn adjustment was applied for multiple testing. The Sonicare® toothbrush handle with the brush head 'Compact ProResults' (81. 7 per cent) and the brush head 'Standard ProResults' (80. 8 per cent), as well as the sonic Waterpik® toothbrush SR 800 E with the standard brush head (78. 2 per cent), showed statistically significantly better cleaning efficacy than all others. The <b>poorest</b> <b>cleaning</b> efficacy was observed for the oscillating-rotating Braun Oral-B Professional Care with the brush head 'Ortho' (less than 50 per cent).

50|$|The {{sculpture}} is {{from the}} Tang Dynasty Period (618-906). It is unclear if the head was broken off at the neck at some point and replaced, {{or if it was}} originally carved separately. It has been suggested that three neck folds give evidence of the head being broken and rejoined in china and reset in the correct place and angle. The Luohan is portrayed as fleshy, short-waisted and slightly androgynous with a developing “dowager’s hump”. The upper ears have been broken and replaced with now-discolored materials. The statue rests on an oval socle carved with lotus petals, and is one with the socle. There is eveidence that the socle was broken off from a lower base at one time and reattached with cement to a different base of an inverted lotus atop a square plinth. There are traces of light green pigment in crevices under the robe and skirt, consistent with Tang and Tang-style paintings. In a photo from the 1920s, the robe still has large patches of what is most likely the original surface. They show designs of lotus, chrysantemums and a vine pattern.

40|$|Pack off is a {{major problem}} in the {{drilling}} industry today, and it will continue to be so until a solution to this problem is found. Being able to find pack offs and in addition to having an understanding of the mechanisms governing the causes of pack offs make it possible to prevent stuck pipe and or other incidences that may lead to non-productive time. The first part of this thesis will describe the rock mechanics of a formation and explains what stresses are involved at governing the wellbore instabilities such as hole collapse and fracture. Types of drilling mud as well as a description of equivalent circulation density and the general causes of pack offs encountered in a well are also discussed. The next part of this thesis is a case study of well 34 / 10 -C- 47 drilled in Gullfaks C which is located in the Norwegian North Sea. This was the main motivation for writing this thesis. The observations require knowledge about what caused that which is observed, the equipment and drilling fluid related to causes before the pack offs incidences are given in detail. Pack offs incidences are gathered into two groups based on the behavior of the SPP curve. Further, causes for the pack offs are explained as good as possible. <b>Poor</b> hole <b>cleaning</b> and wellbore instabilities such as swelling of shales and unconsolidated sands are the most likely causes for these pack offs.

The theories of slurry flow in pipes are quite extensive and are mostly based on fluid mechanics. The various aspects of liquid-particle flow including flow patterns, pressure drop, particle transport and particles in suspensions have been studied. In order to characterize these flows, several non-intrusive methods such as ultrasonic, acoustic, sonar, nucleonic and electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) shows good accuracy. State-of-art systems in each category with accuracies are collected for comparison. The working principle of each system is described with sufficient theory. Various studies within acoustic and ultrasound, including detection of oversized material, velocity measurements and attenuation measurements, are useful for characterization of complex flows. Wellbores are extended over longer distances with incline and horizontal sections to increase production and reduce the number of offshore platforms. To reach the pre-determined target in the reservoir, at a given depth and offset, hole cleaning must be considered. The outcome of <b>poor</b> hole <b>cleaning</b> in complex wells, will likely end up in sidetracking and abandoning, both costly operations.

Achieving acceptable filter lifetimes requires solutions to or avoidance of, such problems as incomplete filter cleaning, re-entrainment (i. e., re-filtration) of particles from filter cleaning, and bridging of filter cake between adjacent filters. These and other potential problems may arise from the materials properties of filter cakes, from the filter-bank design, and from the mechanisms of filter cleaning.

40|$|Background/Aims: A {{multimodal}} {{approach was}} required to manage a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus outbreak on an oncology ward in a tertiary hospital in north Queensland. One component of the approach was to trial antimicrobial disposable curtains, since {{it is known that}} cloth curtains harbor micro-organisms. The aim {{of this study was to}} trial antimicrobial disposable curtains in the oncology ward and a medical ward over a 12 -month period from June 2012 to May 2013. Methods: Disposable curtains were installed in June 2012. Samples were taken to test microbial growth at three, six, nine and 12 months. The 'control' was a sample curtain that had not been hung in a hospital ward. Results: There was no growth of either methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or vancomycin-resistant enterococcus on any of the curtains. Since the trial, the disposable curtains have been installed in 17 inpatient and outpatient areas of the hospital. Not having to change curtains after an infectious patient is discharged saves 50 minutes, which equates to 1. 65 full-time staff per annum. There has also been a 61, 590 saving in laundry costs. However, the rate of multi-resistant organism colonization has increased slightly. Conclusion: It is acknowledged that poor hand hygiene, <b>poor</b> <b>cleaning</b> practices and poor compliance with standard precautions also contribute to transmission of infections.

The cleaning sequences pSC 1, HF/HCl, HF/O 3 and HF/O 3 show lifetimes between 1 ms and 2 ms which is comparable to a laboratory type RCA clean corresponding to a surface recombination velocity Spass below 15 cm/s. The pSC 1, HF/HCl clean achieves lifetimes around 1 ms, whereas the PSG-etch shows <b>poor</b> <b>cleaning</b> quality with lifetimes around 500 μs. Reference PERC cells using a rear protection layer before texturing and diffusion demonstrate efficiencies up to 20. 4 % for the cleaning sequence pSC 1, HF/HCl prior to passivation which {{is comparable to the}} RCA clean. The HF/O 3 cleans result in lower PERC efficiencies up to 20. 0 % mainly due to a lower Fill Factor which is likely caused by etching of the emitter and hence increased contact resistance. Investigations of polished test wafers show that the cleaning sequences pSC 1, HF/HCl, HF-Dip and pSC 1, HF/HCl, HF/O 3 are able to sufficiently remove porous silicon from the front side and simultaneously allowing excellent rear surface passivation. A first batch of PERC solar cell results with polished rear surface post texturing and POCl 3 diffusion achieves efficiencies of up to 20. 7 % when applying an RCA clean. However, the pSC 1, HF/HCl and pSC 1 HF/O 3 still exhibit significantly lower efficiencies since in this batch the porous silicon of the emitter was not yet sufficiently removed, which is subject to further optimization...|$|E
40|$|<b>Poor</b> hole <b>cleaning</b> have dire {{consequences}} {{and as a}} result, special efforts and considerations are planned in drilling operations to avoid complications or hole cleaning issues. Drillers have often been tasked by finding the optimum drilling and rheological parameters for proper hole cleaning. Enormous breakthrough and improvement on hole cleaning has been observed in {{the oil and gas}} industry, thanks to past decades of efforts channeled through research and studies on the understanding of hole cleaning. Nevertheless, hole cleaning still pose a big challenge in many wells today, mostly as a result of non-compliance on use of optimum drilling and rheological parameters, as well as uncertainty of formation type drilled. Although significant amount of works and time have been devoted on hole cleaning by different authors, not so much resources have been dedicated to the critical velocities controlling mode of cuttings transport in wellbore. This thesis work focuses on improving the efficiency of transportation of cuttings in wellbore, with major emphasis on the critical velocities of transportation of particles. A literature review on hole cleaning and critical velocities was carried out by the author. Factors affecting hole cleaning and critical velocities of transportation of cuttings was also highlighted in this work. The author reviewed different models for calculating critical rolling and lifting velocities. Analyses of selected model were performed prior to starting the experimental work.

40|$|Case based {{reasoning}} can {{be applied}} to drilling problems which are too complex to be solved by conventional mathematical or statistical models, due to the complexity and uncertainties involved in drilling a well. People use the principles of case based reasoning in many aspects of daily life, in order to avoid mistakes done in the past. For an oil company it is extremely useful to systematically store the knowledge gained from their engineers so that when they eventually retire the knowledge they posses is not gone to waste. The basic goal {{of this study was to}} use the principles of case based reasoning, and through observations made from the events find the root cause, and thus the solution. Each symptom or observation from a case was directly linked to a root cause, and assigned a relation strength, which in the end was used to find the most probable failure type. The magnitude of the relations ranged 0 to 1. For the model to work properly it was important to obtain a large number of symptoms in order to efficiently separate the different root causes from each other. However, this proved to be a difficult challenge since most observations were based on real time data. The model used in this study was developed in Excel, and was used to test the most probable root cause of 10 previously solved and 2 unsolved cases of <b>poor</b> hole <b>cleaning</b> on a large oil and gas field in the Russian sector of the Barents Sea. The model returned the same root cause as the previously stated cause, in 8 of the 10 cases. </p...|$|R
40|$|Drilling {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} cost drivers in the finding and development of oil and gas fields. More efficient drilling reduces the overall costs and enables drilling of longer wells to reach new reservoir targets. Mechanical friction and <b>poor</b> hole <b>cleaning</b> are the main limiting factors for drilling and well completion of longer wells. <b>Poor</b> hole <b>cleaning</b> can lead to costly drilling problems such as stuck pipe, reduced ROP and higher annular pressure drop leading to lost circulation. Excessive torque and drag caused by mechanical friction, often leads to the inability of reaching the target in high-angle extended reach drilling wells (ERD). Over the years, the oil industry has attempted to stretch the hydraulics and mechanical limitations for drilling longer wells. However, currently available solutions used by the oil industry are not sufficient to overcome these challenges for drilling longer wells that will be required in the future. In addition, stretching these mechanical and hydraulic limitations is essential for improving the drilling efficiency and reducing the overall well construction costs. Drilling boreholes with non-circular geometry is a new concept with step-change potential to stretch operational limits allowing drilling longer wells and more efficient well construction. This concept is based on creating helical grooves in the borehole sidewalls to improve hole cleaning and reduce the mechanical friction. Rifle shaped spiral grooves can be made in the borehole wall with the use of a specialized tool installed as a part of the bottom hole assembly (BHA). The spiral grooves can increase the wellbore cross sectional area and reduce the drill string and formation contact area. The spiral grooves can introduce swirling flow regime in the annulus which may improve the cutting transport. Reduced contact area and improved hole cleaning may reduce the overall mechanical friction. Initial flow simulations indicated differences in the flow regime of circular and non-circular wellbore geometry with integrated helical grooves inside the annulus. More uniform fluid velocity distribution and swirling flow in the non-circular geometry indicated the potential for improving hole cleaning and cutting transport in the new geometry. The objective of this PhD study was to investigate key features and further understanding of the non-circular wellbore concept. Cutting transport and wellbore cleaning as well as mechanical friction has been investigated through flow loop experiments and in the tribology laboratory. A large scale flow loop rig with concrete borehole with rotational drill string was designed and built as the tool for the main part of the PhD work. The modern flow loop includes a 12 meter long test section with a 2 " OD freely rotating drill string inside a 4 " ID wellbore made of concrete. Solid particles were injected while circulating the drilling fluid through the test section at two inclinations; horizontal and 30 o inclined from horizontal. Test results of the big scale flow loop demonstrated the difference in the hydraulics and mechanical performance of circular and non-circular wellbores geometries. For fluid and flow conditions which are relevant for oilfield applications, the results indicated lower pressure gradients and better cuttings transport in the non-circular wellbore than in a circular wellbore. In addition, the torque measurements showed lower mechanical friction in the non-circular wellbore geometry. To support the finding of reduced friction in the non-circular geometry in the flow loop setup, the mechanical friction was also studied in a tribology lab. Test results in the pin-on-disc were consistent with the results obtained from the flow loop experiments. The experiments in the tribology lab confirmed the hypothesis that reducing contact area in the non-circular wellbore geometry can decrease the mechanical friction. Such a comparative, experimental study of hole cleaning in different wellbore geometries has to our knowledge previously never been performed. The results of the present PhD work and the experimental approach could therefore be of value for any one working in the drilling industry.
