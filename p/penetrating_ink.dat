50|$|Paper has its {{own special}} {{problems}} with iron gall ink. The iron-tannic pigment does not make chemical bonds with the cellulose fibers. The ink sticks firmly to the paper, but largely by mechanical bonding; namely, the dried <b>ink</b> <b>penetrates</b> the spaces between the fibers and, after drying, becomes entangled in them. The process of decaying the writing surface is accelerated on paper when compared to parchment, doing the damage in decades or years that could {{take more than a}} millennium on parchment.|$|R
50|$|Della Porta {{invented a}} method which {{allowed him to}} write secret {{messages}} {{on the inside of}} eggs. During the Spanish Inquisition, some of his friends were imprisoned. At the gate of the prison, everything was checked except for eggs. Della Porta wrote messages on the egg shell using a mixture made of plant pigments and alum. The <b>ink</b> <b>penetrated</b> the egg shell which is semi-porous. When the egg shell was dry, he boiled the egg in hot water and the ink {{on the outside of the}} egg was washed away. When the recipient in prison peeled off the shell, the message was revealed once again on the egg white.|$|R
60|$|That {{morning the}} cat, {{which was the}} pet of Mr. Hathorn and his wife, had been found dead near {{the door of the}} schoolhouse. It had been most brutally knocked about. One of its eyes had been destroyed, its soft fur was matted with blood, and it had evidently been beaten to death. That the cat was no {{favorite}} with the boys was certain. The door between the schoolroom and the house was unfastened at night, and the cat in her pursuit of mice not unfrequently knocked over inkstands, and the <b>ink,</b> <b>penetrating</b> into the desks, stained books and papers, and more than one boy had been caned severely for damage due to the night prowlings of the cat.|$|R
40|$|Each day, we {{are confronted}} with {{a large amount of}} more or less {{important}} information that we have to consider, and even in our digital society we need paper for communication, documentation and education. Much of the paper we use or are confronted by in our daily life, such as newspapers, books and packages, contains printed images or texts, and the appearance of both the print and the supporting surface is important. A good contrast between a printed text and the paper makes it easier to read, a detailed print of an illustration makes it more informative, and clear and evenly distributed colours on a package or on a poster make it more appealing. All of these qualities depend on the optical properties of the paper product and the the behavior of light illuminating the different materials. The aim of the work described in this thesis is to characterize the structure of coatings and prints, and to validate models for the optical response and interaction of ink and coating based on optical measurements of physical samples. It is the interactions between the printing ink and the porous structure of the coating layers that are subject to investigation. Experiments have been employed to relate the physical conditions in a flexographic printing nip to the ink setting, affected by the physical and chemical properties of the coating, to the resulting optical response of the printed paperboard. The aim of the work described in this thesis is to characterize the structure of coatings and prints, and to validate models for the optical response and interaction of ink and coating based on optical measurements of physical samples. It is the interactions between the printing ink and the porous structure of the coating layers that are subject to investigation. Experiments have been employed to relate the physical conditions in a flexographic printing nip to the ink setting and the resulting optical response. By comparing simulated and measured results, it was shown that modifications of the surface properties account for the brightness decrease when substrates are calendered. Light scattering simulations, taking into account the surface micro-roughness and the increase in the effective refractive index, showed that surface modifications accounted for most of the observed brightness decrease, whereas the bulk light scattering and light absorption coefficients were not affected by calendering. Ink penetration affects the print density, mottling and dot gain. Results show that ink distribution is strongly affected by surface roughness, differences in pore size and pore size distribution. For samples having different latex amounts and different latex particle sizes, a higher print force did not increase the depth of <b>penetrated</b> <b>ink</b> to any great extent, but rather allowed the wetting to act more efficiently with a more evenly distributed ink film, a higher print density and fewer uncovered areas as a result. Uncovered areas could be linked both to local roughness variations and to local wettability variations on the surface. Samples with different ratios of calcium carbonate/kaolin clay pigment showed an increased porosity and an increase in print density with increasing amount of kaolin in the coating layer...|$|R
40|$|In ink jet {{printing}} when ink {{is printed}} {{on top of}} the paper, two effects occur that {{have an effect on the}} dot that is printed. One effect is that the ink spreads out laterally and the other is that the <b>ink</b> <b>penetrates</b> into the paper. A tone reproduction model was developed that mathematically modeled the effects ink spread and ink penetration have on tone reproduction. Since the optical behavior of ink penetration is very complex, the model only included characteristics that were expected to be significant. This model was built from the foundation of another tone reproduction model which mathematically modeled the optical effect of halftone patterns as a probability. The model was tested using test samples consisting of gray scales produced by thermal ink jet. These samples were produced by varying certain conditions that are thought to affect ink penetration and ink spread and simulate other ink jet environments such as different inks, different papers, and different printers. Microdensitometry equipment was used to obtain data from the samples and the model was analyzed on how well it fit the data...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyze the visual effectiveness of inexpensive, converted near-infrared digital cameras {{on a variety of}} artifacts. Twenty-nine artifacts ranging in condition from unconserved to having completed conservation were chosen from five main type groups; bone, ceramics, metal, paper and textile, and wood. Each artifact was imaged with both a conventional dSLR and one specifically modified to image within the near-infrared band of the electromagnetic spectrum. Following imaging, the two types of photographs for each artifact were directly compared, analyzing visual changes between conventional and near-infrared. The changes were described and each object given a rating of ?not recommended?, ?no change?, or ?recommended? in regards to infrared imaging unveiling useful data outside of that seen with normal photography. Of the twenty-nine artifacts imaged, thirteen were ?recommended? as showing potentially useful information for researchers. While no definitive claims could be made due to the variety of responses across all five groups, organic artifacts, as a whole, tended to show the most potential of responding positively to near-infrared photography using modified dSLRs. Even though none of the five groups imaged consistently across all its artifacts, the ability of modified dSLRs to define patterns in staining and corrosion, differentiating <b>inks,</b> <b>penetrating</b> dirt and stained surfaces, and revealing wood grain and tree rings was well noted and showed the potential of making such cameras a useful part of an analytical toolkit for archaeologists...|$|R
40|$|The printed dots appear {{bigger than}} the dots in the {{original}} digital bitmap. This is {{partly because of the}} spreading and <b>penetrating</b> of the <b>ink</b> on and in the paper, called physical dot gain, and partly because of the diffusion of the light in paper, which is referred to as optical dot gain. Dot gain is often approximated by measurements obtained by densitometer or spectrophotometer. In this study we use a very high-resolution scanner with a resolution of 2 μm/pixel and with a field of view of 2. 7 × 2 mm, which makes it possible to clearly see the small halftone dots and their surroundings. In this camera it is also possible to illuminate the paper surface both from above and below, which means that the camera can capture both the reflected and transmitted lights. Since the transmitted light does not scatter in paper the optical dot gain has no effect on the transmitted image. In this paper we investigate the behavior of physical and optical dot gain for print on coated paperin offset, by using the micro scale images. We also present a method to separate optical and physical dot gain by using the reflected and the transmitted images. By comparing the reflectance and transmittance histograms it is possible to understand that, there is no optical dot gain in transmitted image. We also compare our results with the result obtained by a spectrophotometer, which also measures both reflected and transmitted light. Previously the physical and optical dot gains were mostly analyzed numerically, however in this paper we will also graphically illustrate and compare these two concepts by using microscale images...|$|R
40|$|NASAs future {{exploration}} missions {{focus on}} the manned exploration of the Moon, Mars, and beyond, which will rely heavily {{on the development of}} a reliable communications infrastructure from planetary surface-to-surface, surface-to-orbit, and back to Earth. Flexible antennas are highly desired in many scenarios. Active phased array antennas (active PAAs) with distributed control and processing electronics at the surface of an antenna aperture offer numerous advantages for radar communications. Large-area active PAAs on flexible substrates are of particular interest in NASA s space radars due to their efficient inflatable package that can be rolled up during transportation and deployed in space. Such an inflatable package significantly reduces stowage volume and mass. Because of these performance and packaging advantages, large-area inflatable active PAAs are highly desired in NASA s surface-to-orbit and surface-to-relay communications. To address the issues of flexible electronics, a room-temperature printing process of active phased-array antennas on a flexible Kapton substrate was developed. Field effect transistors (FETs) based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs), with many unique physical properties, were successfully proved feasible for the PAA system. This innovation is a new type of fully inkjet-printable, two-dimensional, high-frequency PAA on a flexible substrate at room temperature. The designed electronic circuit components, such as the FET switches in the phase shifter, metal interconnection lines, microstrip transmission lines, etc., are all printed using a special inkjet printer. Using the developed technology, entire 1 x 4, 2 x 2, and 4 x 4 PAA systems were developed, packaged, and demonstrated at 5. 3 GHz. Several key solutions are addressed in this work to solve the fabrication issues. The source/drain contact is developed using droplets of silver ink printed on the source/drain areas prior to applying CNT thin-film. The wet silver ink droplets allow the silver to wet the CNT thin-film area and enable good contact with the source and drain contact after annealing. A passivation layer to protect the device channel is developed by bonding a thin Kapton film on top of the device channel. This film is also used as the media for transferring the aligned CNT thin-film on the device substrate. A simple and cost-effective technique to form multilayer metal interconnections on flexible substrate is developed and demonstrated. Contact vias are formed on the second substrate prior to bonding on the first substrate. Inkjet printing is used to fill the silver ink into the via structure. The printed silver <b>ink</b> <b>penetrates</b> through the vias to contact with the contact pads on the bottom layer. It is then annealed to form a good connection. One-dimensional and two-dimensional PAAs were fabricated and characterized. In these circuits, multilayer metal interconnects were used to make a complete PAA system...|$|R
40|$|The {{determination}} of line crossing sequences between rollerball pens and laser printers presents difficulties {{that may not}} be overcome using traditional techniques. This research aimed to study the potential of digital microscopy and 3 -D laser profilometry to determine line crossing sequences between a toner and an aqueous ink line. Different paper types, rollerball pens, and writing pressure were tested. Correct opinions of the sequence were given for all case scenarios, using both techniques. When the toner was printed before the ink, a light reflection was observed in all crossing specimens, while this was never observed in the other sequence types. The 3 -D laser profilometry, more time-consuming, presented the main advantage of providing quantitative results. The findings confirm the potential of the 3 -D laser profilometry and demonstrate the efficiency of digital microscopy as a new technique for determining the sequence of line crossings involving rollerball pen ink and toner. With the mass marketing of laser printers and the popularity of rollerball pens, the {{determination of}} line crossing sequences between such instruments is encountered by forensic document examiners. This type of crossing presents difficulties with optical microscopic line crossing techniques involving ballpoint pens or gel pens and toner (1 - 4). Indeed, the rollerball's aqueous <b>ink</b> <b>penetrates</b> through the toner and is absorbed by the fibers of the paper, leaving the examiner with the impression that the toner is above the ink even when it is not (5). Novotny and Westwood (3) investigated the possibility of determining aqueous ink and toner crossing sequences by microscopic observation of the intersection before and after toner removal. A major disadvantage of their study resides in destruction of the sample by scraping off the toner line to see what was underneath. The aim of this research was to investigate the ways to overcome these difficulties through digital microscopy and three-dimensional (3 -D) laser profilometry. The former was used as a technique for the determination of sequences between gel pen and toner printing strokes, but provided less conclusive results than that of an optical stereomicroscope (4). 3 -D laser profilometry, which allows one to observe and measure the topography of a surface, {{has been the subject of}} a number of recent studies in this area. Berx and De Kinder (6) and Schirripa Spagnolo (7, 8) have tested the application of laser profilometry to determine the sequence of intersections of several lines. The results obtained in these studies overcome disadvantages of other methods applied in this area, such as scanning electron microscope or the atomic force microscope. The main advantages of 3 -D laser profilometry include the ease of implementation of the technique and its nondestructive nature, which does not require sample preparation (8 - 10). Moreover, the technique is reproducible and presents a high degree of freedom in the vertical axes (up to 1000 μm). However, when the paper surface presents a given roughness, if the pen impressions alter the paper with a depth similar to the roughness of medium, the results are not always conclusive (8). It becomes difficult in this case to distinguish which characteristics can be imputed to the pen impressions or the quality of the paper surface. This important limitation is assessed by testing different types of paper of variable quality (of different grammage and finishing) and the writing pressure. The authors will therefore assess the limits of 3 -D laser profilometry technique and determine whether the method can overcome such constraints. Second, the authors will investigate the use of digital microscopy because it presents a number of advantages: it is efficient, user-friendly, and provides an objective evaluation and interpretation...|$|R
40|$|Kristeller’s monumental {{reference}} work records {{only one of}} Marulić’s manuscripts on the territory of Great Britain: The Life of St. Jerome (Vita diui Hieronymi) in the British Library (cf. P. O. Kristeller, Iter Italicum. Volume IV /Alia itinera II/: Great Britan to Spain, London & Leiden 1989 and Colloquia Maruliana III, 1994, pp. 6 - 66). However, the libraries on the Island hold two further manuscripts, each invaluable in its own way. The older of the two is Marulić’s autograph of the In epigrammata priscorum commentarius (Ms. Add. A. 25). First registered {{at the beginning of}} this century (F. Madan, A Summary Catalogue of Western Manuscripts in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, Vol. V, Oxford 1905, p. 443), it is recorded again in the index of the entire collection (P. D. Record, A Summary Catalogue of Western Manuscripts in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, Vol. VII, Oxford 1953, p. 303). The codex with dimensions of 226 mm by 162 mm is written on paper and consists of 75 folios (3 + LXXII) with 28 lines on each page. It begins with the index of Roman magistrates referred to in the treatise (fol. 3 : Magistratus. Consul. Folio III. Proconsul XXIIII [...] .) and ends with the inscription from Treviso added subsequently in another hand (fol. LXXv: [...] . AMICO B. M. IN FR. P. VI IN AG. P. VI). Up to fol. LIXv the titles and marginalia are writ-ten in red and basic text in black ink; counting from the inscription on that folio to fol. LXI the basic text is in red ink, fading to brownish grey tint (fols. LXI-LXVI). At the very end the treatise reverts to dark red ink (fols. LXVII-LXX). The foliation, using Roman numerals, is in red ink up to fol. LXVIII inclusive and in pencil on the last four leaves. On the whole the text is legible, despite some damaged sections typically located in the third line from the top of each page, caused by bookworm infestation. Further minor reading problems are caused by <b>ink</b> <b>penetrating</b> from the back to the surface of the paper. In addition some red ink had been spilled on fol. XLIX and a trace of this accident can be followed to the end of the manuscript. On this evidence it can be concluded that the autograph at the Bodleian was not completed in a single effort. In comparison with the British Library’s Life of St. Jerome the manuscript leaves much to be desired in presentation. Many words have been crossed out and there are many insertions between the lines and in margin, mostly by Marulić himself, although there is evidence of the intervention by another two hands. The treatise has no elaborate frontispiece: the title is written in a plain letter style (M. Maruli ad Dominicum Papalem In epigrammata Priscorum commentarius) and is continuous with the preface (fols. I-IIv), which is in turn followed by 37 inscriptions found in Rome (Romana: fols. IIv-XXI) and further 75 found at other Italian locations (Externa: fols. XXI-L). The third and concluding part is dedicated to domestic inscriptions found at Salona which total 30 and can be divided into two groups: those listed in the earlier version (Salonitana: fols. Lv-LXIIIv) and those added and commented upon at a later time (Salonis postea repertum: fols. LXIIII-LXX). The manuscript is not dated. However, it is dedicated to Dmine Papalić (Dominicus Papalis), whom Marulić describes as a commander of a galleon during the Venetian-Turkish War of 1499 - 1503, thus establishing the latter year as the safe terminus post quem (cf. fol. LVIIv). Though the apograph of the same treatise in the Marciana has been available for many years (Cod. Lat. XIV. 112), it has never been researched fully and the recent discovery of the autograph in Oxford provides the solid base for a critical edition. Moreover, it offers a good motive for a fresh interpretation of Marulić’s Commentary, particularly in view of Mommsen’s opinion that some of the inscrip-tions might be Marulić’s fabrications. In addition to essay’s importance as an early and historically invaluable {{reference work}} for the specialist, this text bears witness to the wide-ranging and multi-faceted nature of Marulić’s interests in the sphere of studia humanitatis. The Oxford manuscript is primarily and important gain for the textual criticism which makes possible a reliable reconstrucion of the text of the Commentary. In turn the Glasgow University Library manuscript throws fresh light on Marulić’s entire oeuvre containing inter alia 600 of his hitherto unknown verses. It seems that this work was only recorded in its own library catalogue (cf. J. Young and H. Aitken, A Catalogue of Manuscripts in the Library of the Hunterian Museum in the University of Glasgow, Glasgow 1908, pp. 270 - 271). The Codex Hunter 334 (current Press Mark U. 8. 2.) has wooden covers bound in elaborately decorated smooth purple leather and originally provided with four fastening clasps. The work contains 136 leaves, all but two made of paper. Starting with the second fascicle the foliation is in Roman numerals. The dimensions of the codex (144 mm x 101 mm) and number of lines per page (26) are virtually identical to The Life of St. Jerome manuscript. Basic text is written in black ink, initials, running titles and marginalia are in red ink and richly decorated with geometrical, floral and -in one instance - human motifs (fol. LXXII). The manuscript starts with a brief foreword describing the author and the contents (fol. 3 : M. Mar. Spalatensis. Contenta in presenti uolumine, benigne lector, modo subsequenti reperies [...] .), which is followed by a triple index of the magistrates, proper names and important realia (fols. 3 v- 6). The frontispiece contains the dedication and the name of its recipient (fol. I: Jesus. Ad Dominicum Papalem Marci Maruli uiri eruditissimi In priscorum epigrammata commentarius); an erased and stained, yet still legible pentameter, can be seen at the bottom of the folio (Adsis principio uirgo beata meo). The most important part of the codex, entitled Marci Maruli eiusdem Epigrammata, occupies twenty folios (fols. CIIIv-CXXIIv) and follows directly after the In priscorum epigrammata commentarius (fols. I-CIII). The codex ends with miscellaneous texts, namely an inscription found in Britain and inserted subsequently (fol. CXXIII) and verse from various sources (fols. CXXIIIv-CXXIIIIv). Final text in the manuscript features the well-known forged donation of Alexander the Great to the “Slavs” (fols. CXXV-CXXVv: Priuilegium ex libro quodam antiquissimo e Graeco in Latinum translato). The manuscript is not explicitly dated but it can be inferred from the dedi-catory poem to the Pope Clement VII (fols. CXX-CXXv) that the codex could not have been completed before his election to the See of St. Peter on the 19 th November 1523. The Glasgow manuscript represents the earliest copy of the recently found auto-graph version of the Commentary. Had it been limited to the Commentary, the manu-script would remain a second rate witness, but it also offers the evidence of the linguistic and graphic filter through which a second hand sifted Marulić’s poems. It is the Epigrammata, as the poems are here called, which assign the seminal importance to the discovery of the codex. The collection consists of 141 poems, some of which clearly depart from the traditional epigrammatic genre, and only eight of which have been hitherto clearly attributed to Marulić, namely 3, 4, 23, 24, 25, 27, 126 and 129. Of the rest, a distich against Spalatan archbishop Bartolomeo Averoldi (17) was found recently with an indication that it was probably (ut fertur) by Marulić (cf. I. Babić »Marulićev dvostih o sv. Bartolomeju«, Colloquia Maruliana V, 1995, pp. 189 - 194). We were familiar with the distich De dracone marmoreo (64) from the lunette inscrip-tion on the Papalić palace in Split, but there was no indication of Marulić’s authorship. Finally, the poem Ad Franciscum Natalem (137) has been preserved in the collection of poems written By Frane Božićević (Franciscus Natalis), the person who appears in the Glasgow codex as its addressee. All the poems are written in elegiac distichs, with the following exceptions: numbers 21, 43, 49 and 51 are in Phalaecian hendecasyllables, number 46 in Sapphic strophes, number 54 in metrum Archilochium I (Hor. Carm. IV, 7) and number 63 is a hexametric distich. Certain poems can be placed in different periods of poet’s life. The latest entry whose dating is supported by external evidence is his congratulatory poem to Giulio de’ Medici on his election to papacy on the 19 th November 1523, which therefore must date from the very last days of Marulić’s life († 5 th January 1524). The epigram addressed to his favourite brother Simon (Šimun, ob. 1477) sets the terminus ante quem. However, the codex includes some earlier items; it is beyond reasonable doubt that numerous distichs on mythological personalities (66 - 68; 72 - 125; 133 - 136) date from his formative years and that they were meant as exercises in versification inspired by reading of Ovid’s Metamorphoses. The linguistic analysis of Glasgow verses shows extensive reading of Classics and unexpected familiarity with certain works or authors. The use of the same syntagm in the same place within a line shows that Marulić knew virtually all Roman epic po-ets (Lucretius, Virgil, Lucan, Manilius /!/, Statius, Silius Italicus), satirists Juvenal and Persius; Catullus; elegists Propertius and Tibullus, as well as Horace. He knew Ovid in detail, including the Amores and Ars amatoria. He obviously learnt the genre conventions of epigram from Martial. In comparison with Marulić’s known carmina minora the poems in Glasgow codex introduce three thematic novelties. Many, and at times unexpectedly vehement, satirical epigrams are featured (2 - 4, 6, 8 - 11, 17, 28, 34 - 36, 38, 39, 42, 44, 45, 47, 49, 51, 55 - 59, 69, 70, 130, 131). The intensity of his satirical impulse is startling: he can-not resist it even in such conventional poems as epitaphs (cf. 21, 139). Three poems reveal his love of animals (22, 31, 32), the lament for his slain dog being of anthological value. However, the greatest revelation are the verses which show Marulić as the au-thor of love poems (37, 46). This aspect represents the most serious challenge to our traditional picture of the Poet: the last epigram in the collection (141) is a true Priapeum marked with lascivious ambiguity. The introductory treatise is accompanied by the editio princeps of the Glasgow poems prepared by Darko Novaković...|$|R
