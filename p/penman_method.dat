Consumptive use of water inside the greenhouses {{are not studied enough}} inspite of the {{development of}} greenhouse culture. In this paper, we discussed about the characteristic features of meterological conditions related to evapotranspiration, refering to the data observed in closed and partly opened greenhouses. Regression coefficients were calculated on humidity, temperature, solar radiation and windspeed between the inside and the outside of greenhouse. The meteorological factors in the partly opened greenhouse showed higher regression than the factors in the closed condition. Solar radiation showed the highest regression with the pan evaporationin both closed and partly opened conditions. The applicability of <b>Penman</b> <b>method</b> was examined on estimating potential evapotranspiration in greenhouse. In the closed condition, pan evaporation data showed good agreement with <b>Penman</b> <b>method</b> but the data was 2 times higher than <b>Penman</b> <b>method</b> in the partly opened condition. These results shows that potential evapotranspiration is able to be estimated by <b>Penman</b> <b>method,</b> when windspeed is extremely low as in closed greenhouse. When convective conditions are affected by outside wind, <b>Penman</b> <b>method</b> has some difficulties in application, as wind term in the Penman equation include empirical constant derived from open field observation. The observed results shows pan evaporation is a good indicator on potential evapotranspiration, although it is affected by diameter, color, height, place and so on. ハウス内の水消費環境について, 密閉状態, 側面開放状態の条件で実験を行った. その結果次の事項が明かとなった. 1. ハウス内外の水消費環境因子相互の相関を調査した結果, 密閉状態は側面開放状態に比べ, 日射量以外の環境因子はいずれも相関が低下する傾向が得られた. 2. ハウス内における水消費環境因子と計器蒸発量との相関の高さは日射量, 湿度, 温度, 風速の順であった. とくに計器蒸発量と日射量の相関が極めて高くなることが明かとなった. 3. 密閉状態では計器蒸発量はペンマン法とは相関が高く, またほぼ 1 : 1 の対応を示した. 微風条件ではペンマン式第 2 項の重みは小きく, ハウス内に風速関数を適用することの誤差は無視できるので, ペンマン式はポテンシャル蒸発散量を与えることになる. したがって, 今回用いた直径 20 cmの計器蒸発量によってハウス内のポテンシャル蒸発散量をよく推定できることが明かとなった...|$|E

The study used 30 years of data from the meteorological station in the FELCRA paddy estate, Seberang Perak, Peninsular Malaysia. The effect {{of changes in the}} climatic variables, temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity and wind speed on evapotranspiration were analyzed. Results showed that the mean temperature, mean relative humidity, mean wind speed, and net global radiation have changed by + 0. 182 oC, - 0. 73 %, - 0. 0365 mis, and + 0. 146 MJ/m 2 respectively per decade, while the short wave radiation received has decreased by 0. 0037 MJ/m 2 per decade. The statistical analysis of the evapotranspiration estimations using selected methods showed that the Penman-Monteith, Blaney-Criddle and Pan evaporation methods give similar estimations (P = 0. 05) and are suitable for the study area. When changes to the present climate are imposed for future decades, the over-estimation rate is linear with the Blaney-Criddle and <b>Penman</b> <b>methods</b> whereas for the PenmanMonteith method it is exponential. The overall increment expected after 5 decades is 5. 3 % and 6. 9 % with <b>Penman</b> and Blaney-Criddle <b>methods</b> respectively.

Abstract Traditional techniques in surface water balance computations revolve around point-based observed results of climatic variables. Basin-wide areal estimates derived from point interpolations may not reflect true character of sub-regional variations.

A comparison of point and area-based estimates has been done based on both Thornthwaite and <b>Penman</b> <b>methods.</b> Water balance computations, aridity, humidity and moisture indices, surplus and deficit values at given data points have been used in map-based calculations by developing a script in GIS software – ILWIS (Integrated Land Water Information System). It was found that water balance computations, using point-based rainfall and other climatological data, result into broad generalization of deficit and surplus zones around meteorological stations.

40|$|Evapotranspiration (ET) {{accounts}} for {{a substantial amount of}} the water flux in the arid and semi-arid regions of the World. Accurate estimation of ET has been a challenge for hydrologists, mainly because of the spatiotemporal variability of the environmental and physical parameters governing the latent heat flux. In addition, most available ET models depend on intensive meteorological information for ET estimation. Such data are not available at the desired spatial and temporal scales in less developed and remote parts of the world. This limitation has necessitated the development of simple models that are less data intensive and provide ET estimates with acceptable level of accuracy. Remote sensing approach can also be applied to large areas where meteorological data are not available and field scale data collection is costly, time consuming and difficult. In areas like the Rift Valley regions of Ethiopia, the applicability of the Simple Method (Abtew Method) of lake evaporation estimation and surface energy balance approach using remote sensing was studied. The Simple Method and a remote sensing-based lake evaporation estimates were compared to the Penman, Energy balance, Pan, Radiation and Complementary Relationship Lake Evaporation (CRLE) methods applied in the region. Results indicate a good correspondence of the models outputs to that of the above methods.

Derived values of S were very sensitive to the estimated evaporation during canopy wetting (Iw). Evaporation during wetting was typically small due to low vapor pressure deficits that usually occur {{at the start of}} an event, therefore Iw is best estimated using the <b>Penman</b> <b>method</b> during canopy wetting, rather than assuming a constant evaporation rate over an entire event.

The interdependence {{of most of the}} factors affecting ETc and, their spatial and temporal variability make it difficult to formulate an equation {{that can be used to}} estimate ETc for different crops under different climatic conditions. The present study derived average weekly crop coefficient (Kc) values for groundnut, paddy, tobacco and sugarcane crops commonly grown in Tirupati, Nellore, Rajahmundry and Anakapalli regions of Andhra Pradesh, India respectively and compared them with those computed based on the procedure recommended in FAO 56. The Kc curve fitted to follow the trend similar to that recommended in FAO 56, significantly deviated for most of the crops in the regions at different stages of crop growth, barring a few exceptions. A third order polynomial Kc models for different crops in the regions have therefore been developed for use in the weekly ETc estimation.

The results showed that grass reference evapotranspiration (ET 0, calculated by FAO <b>Penmen</b> Monteith <b>method)</b> was relatively constant from 1970 to 2009.

40|$|In {{estimating}} evapotraspiration from {{upland field}} using the Bowen ratio method, unacceptable values of evapotranspiration are often obtained due to observation errors caused by resolution limit and observation accuracy with measurement devices. In this study, estimation of evapotranspiration {{based on the}} Bowen ratio method was examined using field observation data and evaluation criteria for latent heat flux in an Italian ryegrass field. The {{results showed that the}} undesirable latent heat fluxes can be removed by the evaluation criteria. Most of the removed fluxes occured under the condition of negative or small net radiation and upward soil heat fluxes during night or early morning. Estimated evapotranspiration by the Bowen ratio method agreed with the results of the <b>Penman</b> <b>method</b> and the FAO Penman-Monteith method under no rainfall conditions for grass heights over 12 cm. ...|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} on wheat crop at the project sites of Hail Development Company (HADCO), about 500 km north-west of Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Four centre pivot circles (each 54 ha in area) {{were used in the}} study. A model based on the Modified <b>Penman</b> <b>Method</b> (FAO version) was developed and used for irrigation scheduling. The required micro-climatic parameters were continuously monitored by an automatic weather station installed at the site and transmitted to a computer for processing and analyses. The results of the experiment indicated that an appreciable amount of water (25 %) was saved as compared to the irrigation practice adopted by HADCD, and the yield is increased significantly by using this technique of scheduling. In addition, the conservation of water results in reducing the working hours of the equipment and labour...|$|E
40|$|The {{sublimation}} of {{snow and}} evaporation of melted snow is contrasted between brush, grass and bare ground sites using eddy-correlation data. Averaged over the entire winter season, the evaporation/sublimation is about 20 % greater over the brush site than the bare ground site, apparently due to greater supply of snow. Blowing snow collects in patches of brush, which protrude above the snow. This study evaluates commonly used simple formulations of the surface moisture flux including {{two versions of the}} bulk aerodynamic formula and the stability-dependent <b>Penman</b> and Penman–Monteith <b>methods</b> for predicting evaporation/sublimation. The evaluation is based on eddy-correlation data from the three sites with conditions ranging from snow-free to snow-covered ground surfaces. The water availability factors, required for these formations, increase with snow-fraction coverage, but less so with melting conditions, depending on site and formulation. Various influences on the sublimation/evaporation are examined and the performance and shortcomings of each formulation are assessed...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} work aims {{to evaluate}} the impacts of agricultural expansion on irrigation water requirements in Taita Hills, SE-Kenya. The first procedure of this research consists in implementing and calibrating an Evapotraspiration (ET) model for the study area. The ET {{is an important component}} of the hydrological cycle and an accurate quantification of such component is crucial for the design, operation and managment of irrigation systems. Three temperature based ET models are evaluated, namely the Hargreaves, the Thornthwaite and the Blaney-Criddle, given that these are the most recommended approaches when only air temperature data are available at weather stations. To overcome the insufficient data retrieved from ground stations, remote sensing land surface temperature data are used as input for the models. One weather station with complete climate datasets is used to calibrate the selected model using as reference the FAO- 56 <b>Penman</b> -Monteith <b>method.</b> Simultaneously, future land use scenarios are simulated using a Land Use and Land Cover Change (LUCC) model. Synthetic weather datasets (temperature and precipitation) are generated using a Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, the ET model and the LUCC model are integrated into a modeling framework in order to delineate Irrigation Water Requirement (IW) scenarios. The simulations indicate that throughout the next 20 years the low availability of space in highlands will drive agricultural expansion to areas with higher IWR in the foothills. However, climate changes predicted by GCMs will likely decrease IWR when compared with scenarios using the same temperature and precipitation averages as in the historical dataset...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the crop water requirement of some selected crops for the area around Kampe (Omi) Dam Irrigation Project. These crops include rice, maize, tomato, vegetable amaranth, pepper, onion and cabbage. Crop water requirement {{for each of the}} crops was determined by using 25 -year climatic data in CROPWAT. Reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) was determined using the FAO <b>Penman</b> Monteith <b>method.</b> For all the crops considered, three decades: decades I, II, and III and seven crop growth stages: nursery, nursery/land preparation, land preparation, initial stage, development stage, mid-season and late season stage were considered. Crops were planted during the 2007 Rainy Season and the crop coefficient for each was determined. The study shows that for the area under study, reference evapotranspiration (ETo) varied from 3. 4 to 4. 8 mm/day. Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and crop water requirement for paddy rice varied from 0. 28 to 4. 18 mm/day and 2. 0 to 102. 4 mm/day, for maize from 1. 82 to 4. 88 and 1. 3 to 45. 6 mm/day, for tomato from 8. 7 to 52. 8 and 0. 0 to 45. 2 mm/day, for vegetable from 3. 07 to 4. 74 and from 7. 4 to 45. 6 mm/day, for pepper 3. 13 to 4. 8 and from 15. 1 to 40. 7 mm/day, for onion from 1. 80 to 38. 4 mm/day, and for cabbage from 28. 2 to 40. 9 mm/day respectively. The peak water requirement was 0. 63 l/s/ha or 5. 4 mm/day with an application efficiency of 65 %. Irrigation water requirement was estimated as about 61. 2 MCM while the actual water diverted was 131 MCM. The reservoi...|$|R
