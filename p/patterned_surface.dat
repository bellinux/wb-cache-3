2500|$|A {{variety of}} {{finishes}} {{can be applied}} to dimension stone to achieve diverse architectural and aesthetic effects. [...] These finishes include, but are not limited to, the following. [...] A polished finish gives the surface a high luster and strong reflection of incident light (almost mirror-like). [...] A honed finish provides a smooth, satin-like ("eggshell"), nonreflective surface. [...] More textured finishes include brush-hammered, sandblasted, and thermal. [...] A brush-hammered finish, similar to a houndstooth pattern, creates a rough, but uniformly <b>patterned</b> <b>surface</b> with impact tools varying in coarseness. [...] A sandblasted surface provides an irregular pitted surface by impacting sand or metal particles at high velocity against a stone surface.

[...] This finish may change the natural color of the stone depending on mineralogical composition, particularly with stones containing higher levels of iron.|$|E

2500|$|The Insular {{style is}} most {{famous for its}} highly dense, {{intricate}} and imaginative decoration, which takes elements from several earlier styles. [...] Late Iron Age Celtic art or [...] "Ultimate La Tène", gave the love of spirals, triskeles, circles and other geometric motifs. These were combined with animal forms probably mainly deriving from the Germanic version of the general Eurasian animal style, though also from Celtic art, where heads terminating scrolls were common. Interlace was used by both these traditions, as well as Roman art (for example in floor mosaics) and other possible influences such as Coptic art, and its use was taken to new levels in insular art, where it was combined with the other elements already mentioned.

While biofouling can be controlled to various degrees with different microstructure-based <b>patterned</b> <b>surfaces,</b> understanding of the underlying mechanism is still imprecise. Researchers have long speculated that microtopographies might influence near-surface microfluidic conditions, thus microhydrodynamically preventing the settlement of microorganisms. It is therefore very important to identify the microfluidic environment developed on <b>patterned</b> <b>surfaces</b> and its relation with the antifouling behaviour of those surfaces. This study considered the wall shear stress distribution pattern as a significant aspect of this microfluidic environment.

40|$|<b>Surfaces</b> with <b>patterned</b> {{wettability}} have well-defined domains containing both wettable and non-wettable regions. One of the {{key features}} of the <b>surfaces</b> with <b>patterned</b> wettability is their ability to localize wetting of liquids preferentially within the patterned wettable regions. This ability of the <b>patterned</b> <b>surfaces</b> has been widely explored as a simple route to pattern both liquids, as well as, solids for various applications such as microfluidics, electronic and optical devices, surfaces with enhanced heat transfer properties, etc. However, most of the <b>patterned</b> <b>surfaces</b> exhibit wettability contrast only with high surface tension liquids such as water, thereby limiting the applications of the <b>patterned</b> <b>surfaces</b> to only aqueous systems. Herein, we utilize the design principles of superomniphobicity (repellency towards all liquids) to develop the first-ever <b>patterned</b> superomniphobic-superomniphilic <b>surfaces</b> that exhibit extremely wettability contrast with both high and low surface tension liquids. Utilizing these <b>patterned</b> <b>surfaces,</b> we demonstrate site-selective self-assembly of various liquids including: oils, alcohols, polymer solutions and solid dispersions. We also demonstrate site-selective condensation and boiling with low surface tension liquids, which is crucial when designing surfaces with significantly enhanced, phase-change, heat-transfer properties. We have further utilized <b>surfaces</b> with <b>patterned</b> wettability as templates for fabricating monodisperse, multi-phasic micro- and nano-particles. The developed technique termed WETS (Wettability Engendered Templated Self-assembly) provides us with an unprecedented ability to manufacture multi-phasic particles, on a large-scale, with precise control over the size (down to 25 nm), shape, chemistry and surface charge of the particles. We further demonstrate {{the utility of the}} WETS technique in developing amphiphilic building blocks for self-assembly and multi-functional cargo carriers. Finally, we have also studied stimuli-responsive shape reconfigurations of the multi-phasic WETS particles. Overall, this dissertation puts forward design principles for developing <b>surfaces</b> with <b>patterned</b> wettability that are universal to almost all liquids, thus enabling novel applications for the <b>patterned</b> <b>surfaces,</b> such as the WETS technique reported here...|$|R

Interestingly, the electro-osmotic mobility tensor is not simply related to the hydrodynamic slip tensor, except in special cases. Our results imply that significantly enhanced electro-osmotic flows over super-hydrophobic surfaces are possible, but only with charged liquid-gas interfaces. Comment: 10 page...|$|R

40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} the pool boiling of one-component fluids {{with a focus}} on the effects of surface wettability on the single-bubble dynamics. We employed the dynamic van der Waals theory [Phys. Rev. E 75, 036304 (2007) ], a diffuse-interface model for liquid-vapor flows involving liquid-vapor transition in nonuniform temperature fields. We first perform simulations for bubbles on homogeneous surfaces. We find that an increase in either the contact angle or the surface superheating can enhance the bubble spreading over the heating surface and increase the bubble departure diameter as well and therefore facilitate the transition into film boiling. We then examine the dynamics of bubbles on <b>patterned</b> <b>surfaces,</b> which incorporate the advantages of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. The central hydrophobic region increases the thermodynamic probability of bubble nucleation while the surrounding hydrophilic region hinders the continuous bubble spreading by pinning the contact line at the hydrophobic-hydrophilic intersection. This leads to a small bubble departure diameter and therefore prevents the transition from nucleate boiling into film boiling. With the bubble nucleation probability increased and the bubble departure facilitated, the efficiency of heat transfer on such <b>patterned</b> <b>surfaces</b> is highly enhanced, as observed experimentally [Int.

The essence of the method is incorporating a (super) hydrophobically modified metal-based gauze onto the surface of a hydrophilic polystyrene (PS) flat sheet by a simple lab oven-based thermal pressing procedure. The produced hybrid <b>patterned</b> <b>surfaces</b> consisted of PS patches sitting within the holes of the metal gauzes. The method allows for an easy control over the pattern dimension (e. g., patch size) by varying gauze mesh size and thermal pressing temperature, which is then translated to an easy optimization of the ultimate fog water collection efficiency. Given the low-cost and wide availability of both PS and metal gauze, this method has a great potential for scaling-up. The results showed that the hydrophilic-superhydrophobic <b>patterned</b> hybrid <b>surfaces</b> with a similar pattern size to Stenocara beetles’s back pattern produced significantly higher fog collection efficiency than the uniformly (super) hydrophilic or (super) hydrophobic surfaces.
