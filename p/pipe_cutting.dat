2500|$|Since 5 November, {{there has}} been a {{shortage}} of chlorine for water treatment due to Israeli blockades, increasing the risk of outbreak of water diseases. On 27 December, Israeli airstrikes extensively damaged two water wells, rendering a population of 30,000 Palestinians without water. On 2 January, airstrikes in the al-Mughraqa area damaged a main drinking water <b>pipe,</b> <b>cutting</b> off water supplies to 30,000 people in the Nuseirat Camp. The UN sums the situation that as of 2 January, 250,000 people in Gaza City and northern Gaza are without water supply; seven water wells were seriously damaged and cannot be repaired due to bombardments. As of 4 January, and as reported by the Palestinian Coastal Municipality Water Utility (CMWU) throughout the UN reports, 70% of the Gaza strip 1.5 million population have no access to water, in particular in Gaza City and northern Gaza. As of 6 January, 800,000 Palestinians have no access to water, and those who still enjoy water access face problems in purifying such water as well as risking additional danger of contamination due to waste water leakage. This situation lasts in the third week of the attacks where 500,000 Palestinians still have no access to running water, another 500,000 receive water for four to six hours only every five to seven days, and the rest receive water for four to six hours every two or three days. Five days after the unilateral lull, one fifth of the Gaza strip 1.5 million population has no direct access to drinking water and currently depends on water purchased from private suppliers. As of [...] 26, 8 January days after the unilateral ceasefire, at least 70% of the water system is functioning, although {{this does not mean that}} everyone is receiving water due to localized damage. By 5 February, a month and 8 days since the beginning of the Israeli attacks, the CMWU reports that 50 percent of Gaza's 1.5 million population receives running water for 6–8 hours every second day; 30 percent of the population receives running water every third day; and ten percent of the population receives water every five days. Ten percent of the population does not receive running water and depends on tankered water. As of 9 February, the CMWU reports that 50,000 people do not have access to water and an additional 150,000-200,000 receive water every 5 or 6 days. According to the World Health Organization guidelines, 80% of drinking water in Gaza is not currently safe for human consumption. In light of the poor quality of water, the Ministry of Health and the UNICEF has stated concerns about the increased risk of diarrhea and other water-borne diseases in infants.|$|E

30|$|Machine {{components}} and systems, such as gears, bearings, <b>pipes,</b> <b>cutting</b> tools and turbines, may experience {{various types of}} faults, such as breakage, crack, pitting, wear, corrosion. If not being properly monitored and treated, such faults can propagate and lead to machinery performance degradation, malfunction, or even severe component/system failure. It is significant to reliably detect machinery defects, evaluate their severity, predict the fault propagation trends, and schedule optimized maintenance and inspection activities to prevent unexpected failures. Advances in these areas will support ensuring equipment and production reliability, safety, quality and productivity. Machine fault diagnostics and prognostics tools have wide potential applications in various industries particularly manufacturing, aerospace, transportation, oil and gas energy. The aim of this special issue on “Machine Fault Diagnostics and Prognostics” is to present new methods and tools for equipment condition monitoring, fault diagnostics, and equipment prognostics aiming at predicting fault propagation and remaining useful life.|$|R
40|$|Upper-mantle xenoliths in {{volcanic}} <b>pipes</b> <b>cutting</b> {{the axis}} of the Sierra Nevada batholith contain predominantly spinel-bearing peridotites (with sporadic garnet) and garnet websterites. In spite of the enormous thickness of the Sierran crust, the Sierran upper mantle has not attained the garnet peridotite stability field. The peridotites have forsteritic (Fo 88 _ 92) olivines, Cr-diopsides, Cr-spinels, and magnesian orthopyroxenes (En 8 g_ 92). Their texture and compositional characteristics of the coexisting phases indicate that these are fragments of the upper mantle that had undergone various degrees of partial fusion. The P-rconditions of reequilibration and mineralogical characteristics suggest that the partial fusion was accompanied by diapiric uprise. The REE distribution patterns are nearly chondritic. Garnet websterite xenoliths also contain magnesian and Cr-rich phases. Their bulk chemical compositions are like pyroxenite cumulates. The garnet websterites from Big Creek differ from those occurring at Pick and Shovel in having more Fe-rich phases and occasional hydrous minerals. The Pick and Shovel garnet websterites are interpreted to be pyroxene-rich, garnet-free cumulates formed by fractional crystallization of melts generated by partial melting of subcontinental lithosphere at depth> 60 km.
