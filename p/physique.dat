However, there are no studies which compare <b>physiques</b> of MPW’s children with those of rural children and urban children. Also, few studies have been done on <b>physiques</b> of MPW’s children as it relates to socioeconomic factors in China. Methods: We examined across-sectional study of 2457 children from Shanghai and Wuhu city in 2011. First, we compared the differences of <b>physiques</b> among three groups by ANOVA. Second, ANCOVA were applied to analyze the associations between the <b>physiques</b> and socioeconomic factors by taking <b>physiques</b> as dependent variables. The independent variables included socioeconomic factors such as the parental occupation, the parental education and fam-ily monthly income. Third, ANCOVA were used to assess differences in <b>physiques</b> among the three groups by adjusting socioeconomic factors. Results: There were significant differences in all physical in...|$|R

5|$|A sickly child, Gordon Childe {{was educated}} {{at home for}} a number of years, before gaining a private school {{education}} in North Sydney. In 1907, he began attending Sydney Church of England Grammar School, gaining his Junior Matriculation in 1909 and Senior Matriculation in 1910. At school he studied ancient history, French, Greek, Latin, geometry, algebra and trigonometry, achieving good marks in all subjects, but was bullied because of his strange appearance and unathletic <b>physique.</b> In July 1910 his mother died; his father soon took Monica Gardiner as his third wife. Childe's relationship with his father was strained, particularly following his mother's death, and they disagreed on the subject of religion and politics, with the Reverend being a devout Christian and conservative while his son was an atheist and socialist.|$|E
5|$|After the French chemists Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, Louis Jacques Thénard, and Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac {{approved}} the experiments {{of the young}} pharmacist Balard, the results were presented at a lecture of the Académie des Sciences and published in Annales de Chimie et <b>Physique.</b> In his publication, Balard states that he changed the name from muride to brôme on the proposal of M. Anglada. Brôme (bromine) derives from the Greek βρωμος (stench). Other sources claim that the French chemist and physicist Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac suggested the name brôme for the characteristic smell of the vapors. Bromine was not produced in large quantities until 1858, when the discovery of salt deposits in Stassfurt enabled its production as a by-product of potash.|$|E
