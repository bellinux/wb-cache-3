40|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{agriculture}} is food production. There are always limited resources available for food production, thus the resource efficiency is always the key issue. The modern agriculture is using resources like external nutrients (fertilizers) and non renewable energy in large scale. The high production intensity results in high production per hectare, {{on the other hand}} it results also in serious environmental harms. Organic farming is based on more internal and renewable resources than conventional farming. Very often it results also in lower production intensity and lower production per hectare. There is a common criticism against organic agriculture as inefficient use of land and also inefficient use of nutrients and energy per output unit. Closer scrutiny indicates far too often, that the system boundaries and definition of production system explain the results rather than the fundamentals of different production systems.

40|$|Agricultural {{production}} is {{highly dependent on}} inorganic substances including fertilizers. High-yielding crop varieties, such as corn, require large amounts of <b>primary</b> <b>nutrients</b> including nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Farmers often add a surplus of nutrients to crops to maximize yields. Utilization of <b>primary</b> <b>nutrients</b> has {{increased by more than}} 300 % while that of nitrogen alone has increased by more than 600 % between 1960 and 2007 (USDA, 2009). From 1964 to 2007, the use of nitrogen in the corn sector alone increased from 1, 623, 000 to 5, 714, 000 nutrient tons (USDA, 2009). While increasing production, increased fertilizer use can potentially create negative externalities in the form of nitrate-nitrogen contamination in groundwater. Groundwater is the source of drinking water for about half the total U. S. population and nearly all of the rural population, and it provides over 50 billion gallons per day for agricultural needs (USGS, 2009). In the U. S. the main source of nitrate pollution in the groundwater results from the actions of farmers through the use of fertilizers and other chemicals (Haller, et al. 2009). Nitrogen-nitrate contamination can have adverse human affects including methemoglobinemia or ―blue-baby‖ syndrome (Majumdar, 2003). The potential for nitrate contamination in corn {{production is}} especially problematic as corn alone accounts for over 90 % of feed grains produced in the U. S. (USDA, 2009). The USDA estimates that approximately 80 million acres of land is planted to corn, with the majority in the Heartland region (the Midwest) of the U. S. (2009). The Heartland region is primarily rural and much of the population there derives its drinking water from groundwater. Therefore, the potential for groundwater contamination is greatly increased in this region.
