40|$|AbstractDemands of ultra-precision {{machining}} {{systems have}} recently increased for machining three dimensional nano-geometries. Such systems require not only horizontal positioning systems but also vertical positioning systems with a nanometer positioning accuracy. However, the gravity load of moving mass negatively affects the positioning accuracy {{especially in a}} vertical positioning system. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} compensate the influence of the gravity load for vertical ultra-precision positioning. Although the gravity compensation method using a non-contact vacuum cylinder has been proposed, it is difficult to improve the sealing performance of the non-contact seal. Thus, this study proposes the magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> for linear motion system with a gravity compensator. In general, magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seals</b> have been applied to rotary motion systems, however there are few studies on linear motion systems so far. When a magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> is applied to linear motion systems, the magnetic fluid leaks out of the seal clearance due to the movement, and it cannot keep the performance as a seal. In this study, it is possible to prevent leaking the magnetic <b>fluid</b> from the <b>seal</b> clearance and also to maintain the performance of the seal by holding a magnetic fluid by the two pole pieces shaped tapered tip and putting it near the piston made of non-magnetic material and coated with oil repellent layer. The proposed magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> performance has been evaluated. As a result, the result confirmed that the proposed magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> is useful as a linear motion seal, and the oil repellent layer on the piston surface can largely improve the sealing performance...|$|R
