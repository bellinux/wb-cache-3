40|$|The {{right to}} trial {{by a jury}} of one’s peers is a primary and unique {{characteristic}} of the American judicial system (Shuman, Hamilton, & Daley, 1994). Jury service is a privilege and responsibility of citizenship.

Title II covers state court programs and services, including jury service. It requires courts to provide access to jury service by making reasonable changes in policies, practices, and procedures; ensuring effective communication (e. g., sign language interpreters for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing); and removing architectural barriers in courthouse facilities (Bleyer, McCarty, & Wood, 1995).

The General Lighthouse Authorities (GLAs) of the UK and Ireland, recognising the continuing importance of rock-mounted lighthouses as <b>physical</b> <b>aids</b> for navigation, funded a pilot project, commissioning Plymouth University {{to monitor the}} tower. The present study aims to provide {{more information on the}} structural behaviour of the Eddystone Lighthouse under the impacts from wave loading, through the utilisation of a 3 D finite element model.

The point of application of the wave load is important in the tower’s structural response; the lighthouse being especially vulnerable to larger displacements when the wave acts above its cylindrical base. Finite element analysis suggests that the lighthouse is stable with regard to material failure, and for failure mechanisms of overturning and sliding there are factors of safety of 6. 3 and 8. 0 respectively. A hypothetical unbroken wave of 17. 5 m height would be required to overturn the lighthouse, and one of height 17 m would cause cracking at the base, but in such a location these waves would not be possible...|$|E

40|$|Horses {{constantly}} {{modify their}} behaviour {{as a result}} of experience. This involves the creation of an association between events or stimuli. The influence of people on the modification and generation of certain behaviour patterns extends beyond the intentional training of the horse. The impact of any action depends on how it is perceived by the horse, rather than the motive of the handler. Negative and positive reinforcement increase the probability of specific behaviours recurring i. e. strengthen the association between events, whereas punishment reduces the probable recurrence of a behaviour without providing specific information about the desired alternative. In this paper the term 'punishers' is used to refer to the <b>physical</b> <b>aids,</b> such as a whip or crop, which may be used to bring about the process of punishment. However, if their application ceases when a specific behaviour occurs they may negatively reinforce that action. Intended 'punishers' may also be rewarding (e. g. for attention seeking behaviour). Therefore, contingency factors (which define the relationship between stimuli, such as the level of reinforcement), contiguity factors (which describe the proximity of events in space or time) and choice of reinforcing stimuli are critical in determining the rate of learning. The many problems associated with the application of punishment in practice lead to confusion by both horse and handler and, possibly, abuse of the former. Most behaviour problems relate to handling and management of the horse and can be avoided or treated with a proper analysis of the factors influencing the behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Tabletop roleplaying is {{a dynamic}} and flourishing hobby that has become {{increasingly}} accessible {{to a wide variety}} of participants. The games themselves, as well as the gaming subculture, offer players a number of personal and Social benefits that continue to enrich their lives long after they leave the table. Using Goffman 2 ̆ 7 s theories of Dramaturgy and Frame Analysis, this paper seeks to examine the positive impact of gaming in three key areas. The first is an analysis of the subculture which includes the evolution of the games, the growth and diversification of the roleplaying community, and the current shift in stereotypes about gaming. The second section discusses the ways in which microcultural worlds are created, with an emphasis on the systematic alignment of group frames, different types of emotional and Social crossover that occurs, and the conveyance of status. The final segment describes the processes that create engrossment and identification in the games. It focuses on the balance of the three frameworks used in fantasy creation, types of <b>physical</b> <b>aids</b> used to bridge fantasy and reality, relationships that exist between players and their characters, and the negotiation of role conflict that arises from maintaining multiple roles simultaneously.

Radiography (computed axial tomography [CAT]) has already been successfully used to help locate and insert catheters near the brachial plexus. 13 In contrast, ultrasound (US) is currently the only imaging tech-nique allowing anatomic assessment of the brachial plexus and/or adjacent structures at the patient bedside and hence also in the operating room. 14 Many believe US can identify plexus structures, and coupled with topographic anatomical knowledge, ease brachial plexus blocks. 14, 15 However, the costs of the US devices continue to limit widespread ap-plication of this approach.

In this study, tasks were categorized into three categories: self-maintenance activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities for daily living (IADLs), and enhanced activities of daily living (EADLs). Assistance for IADL tasks consists of housekeeping such as laundry and medication reminder. On the other hand, tasks such as new learning and pastime refer to EADL. Older people prefer to have robot assistance rather than human assistance for IADLs and then EADLs. In contrast, it was found that older people favor to have assistance for ADLs and also some specific tasks of IADLs and EADLs, namely decision on medication, meal preparation, and social interaction. The results of this study are similar to Broadbent et al. [13] findings.

DESIGN [...] Controlled trial of effect of help from a multidisciplinary team on admission rates of people with dementia. SETTING [...] Seven general practices in Cambridge. SUBJECTS [...] 2889 subjects aged 75 and over, of whom 159 were identified as having dementia with a two stage community survey. Eighty six subjects were referred for extra help if they or their supporters wished. The other 73 subjects had access to the usual services and served as controls. INTERVENTION [...] Subjects and families in the action group were offered a wide range of help, including financial benefits, <b>physical</b> <b>aids,</b> home helps, respite admissions, practical advice, and psychiatric assessments. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Permanent admission to long term care within two years after diagnosis. RESULTS [...] Early intervention did not affect admission rates in subjects who lived with supporters. By contrast, nine of the 14 (64 %) subjects with moderate or severe dementia living alone were admitted in the action group in the study's second year compared with only one of 13 (8 %) controls (p = 0. 004). CONCLUSIONS [...] Some people with moderate or severe dementia who lived alone and were at serious risk may have been identified earlier by the resource team.

40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} depressive symptoms associated with stroke. Depression related to stroke is highly prevalent, {{not easy to}} diagnose, with important consequences for prognosis. Specific beliefs patients hold about their physical illness are well known to be important predictors of outcome, and {{there is now a}} growing literature on the role of beliefs about mental illness as predictors of outcome. Much less is known about how patients who have had a stroke make sense of their mood symptoms. Research indicates that including depressed patients in decisions about their care results in better outcomes; however, little is known about what treatments depressed stroke patients most prefer, and how this relates to their beliefs about their mood symptoms. Therefore, the aims of the current study were to: 1) Investigate patients' beliefs about their depressive symptoms following a stroke to find out if there are similar patterns in the way they think about them, and 2) to assess stroke patients’ preferences for treatment for their depressive symptoms and to see how this relates to their beliefs about their low mood. Q methodology was used. Twenty stroke patients were recruited who had endorsed depressive symptoms on standardized measures of mood. Patients sorted a wide range of statements about low mood associated with stroke and revealed four distinctive viewpoints: 1) depression due to external, physical factors, an emphasis on physical symptoms and social consequences; 2) highly determined with less worry, the importance of positive social support, helpful environment and a belief that depression will be over quickly; 3) past depression, internal cause, out of control and lasting a long time; 4) strong need for independence and the meaning of <b>physical</b> <b>aids.</b> Frustration, anger and worry, but not out of control.

40|$|Background: Preterm {{birth is}} known to {{constitute}} the major risk factor for development of germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage (GM-IVH). Head position may affect cerebral hemodynamics and thus may be involved indirectly in development of GM-IVH. Turning the head toward one side may functionally occlude jugular venous drainage on the ipsilateral side while increasing intracranial pressure and cerebral blood volume. Thus, {{it has been suggested}} that cerebral venous pressure is reduced and hydrostatic brain drainage improved if the patient is in supine midline position with the bed tilted 30 °. The midline position might be achieved in the supine position and, with the use of <b>physical</b> <b>aids,</b> in the lateral position as well. Midline position should be kept, at least when the incidence of GM-IVH is greatest, that is, during the first two to three days of life. Objectives: Primary objective To assess whether head midline position is more effective than any other head position for preventing or extending germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage in infants born at ≤ 32 weeks' gestational age. Secondary objectives To perform subgroup analyses regarding gestational age, birth weight, intubated versus not intubated, and with or without GM-IVH at trial entry. Search methods: We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 8), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to September 19, 2016), Embase (1980 to September 19,. 2016), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to September 19, 2016). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials. Selection criteria: Randomized clinical controlled trials, quasi-randomized trials, and cluster-randomized controlled trials comparing placing very preterm infants in a head midline position versus placing them in a prone or lateral decubitus position, or undertaking a strategy of regular position change, or having no prespecified position. We included trials enrolling infants with existing GM-IVH and planned to assess extension of hemorrhage in a subgroup of infants. We planned to analyze horizontal (flat) versus head elevated positions separately for all body positions. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. For each of the included trials, two review authors independently extracted data (e. g., number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, initiation and duration of head midline position, co-intervention with horizontal vs head elevated position, use of <b>physical</b> <b>aids</b> to maintain head position) and assessed risk of bias (e. g., adequacy of randomization, blinding, completeness of follow-up). The primary outcomes considered in this review are GM-IVH, severe IVH, and neonatal death. Main results: Our search strategy yielded 2696 references. Two review authors independently assessed all references for inclusion. Two randomized controlled trials, for a total of 110 infants, met the inclusion criteria of this review. Both trials compared supine midline head position with the bed at 0 ° versus supine head rotated 90 ° with the bed at 0 °. We found no trials that compared supine versus prone midline head position, and no trials that compared effects of head tilting. We found no significant differences in rates of GM-IVH (typical risk ratio [RR] 1. 14, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 55 to 2. 35; typical risk difference [RD] 0. 03, 95 % CI - 0. 13 to 0. 18; two studies, 110 infants; I 2 = 0 % for RR and I 2 = 0 % for RD), severe IVH (typical RR 1. 57, 95 % CI 0. 28 to 8. 98; typical RD 0. 02, 95 % CI - 0. 06 to 0. 10; two studies, 110 infants; I 2 = 0 % for RR and I 2 = 0 % for RD), and neonatal mortality (typical RR 0. 52, 95 % CI 0. 16 to 1. 65; typical RD - 0. 07, 95 % CI - 0. 18 to 0. 05; two studies, 110 infants; I 2 = 28 % for RR and I 2 = 44 % for RD). Among secondary outcomes, we found no significant differences in terms of cystic periventricular leukomalacia (one study; RR 3. 25, 95 % CI 0. 14 to 76. 01; RD 0. 04, 95 % CI - 0. 07 to 0. 15), retinopathy of prematurity (one study; RR 2. 27, 95 % CI 0. 85 to 6. 11; RD 0. 25, 95 % CI - 0. 02 to 0. 53), and severe retinopathy of prematurity (one study; RR 2. 73, 95 % CI 0. 31 to 24. 14; RD 0. 09, 95 % CI - 0. 09 to 0. 26). None of the included trials reported on the other specified outcomes of this review (i. e., cerebellar hemorrhage, brain magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities, impairment in cerebral hemodynamics, long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes, and major neurodevelopmental disability). The quality of evidence supporting these findings is limited owing to the imprecision of the estimates. We identified no ongoing studies. Authors' conclusions: Given the imprecision of the estimate, results of this systematic review are consistent with beneficial or detrimental effects of a supine head midline position versus a lateral position and do not provide a definitive answer to the review question...|$|E
