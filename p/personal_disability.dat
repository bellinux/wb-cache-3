The question is over, if this is shown not to be a legislative act. But what is very usual and natural, is to corrupt judicature into legislature. On this point it is proper to inquire whether a court of judicature, which decides without appeal, has it as a necessary incident of such judicature, that whatever it decides de jure is law. Nobody will, I hope, assert this, because the direct consequence would be the entire extinction of the difference between true and false judgments. For, if the judgment makes the law, and not the law directs the judgment, it is impossible there could be such a thing as an illegal judgment given.|$|E

5000|$|In the Avegnor case, the Louisiana Supreme Court {{held that}} {{there was such a}} privity between a person whose life estate had been {{condemned}} under the Act of July 17, 1862, and his heirs, that the latter were bound by a suit and decree to enforce a mortgage executed by their ancestor containing the pact de non alienando, to which the ancestor alone had been made a party defendant. It is sustained by Wallach v. Van Riswick, ubi supra, as will appear by the following passages from that Court's opinion:"If it be contended that the heirs of Charles S. Wallach," [...] the person whose property had been condemned,"cannot take by descent unless their father, at his death, was seized of an estate of inheritance, e.g., reversion or a remainder, it may be answered that even at common law it was not always necessary that the ancestor should be seized to enable the heir to take by descent. Shelley's Case is that where the ancestor might have taken and been seized, the heir shall inherit. Fortescue, J., in Thornby v. Fleetwood, 1 Str. 318.""If it were true that at common law the heirs could not take in any case where their ancestor was not seized at his death, the present case must be determined by the statute. Charles S. Wallach was seized of the entire fee of the land before its confiscation, and the act of Congress interposed to take from him that seizing for a limited time. That it was competent to do, attaching the limitation {{for the benefit of the}} heirs. It wrought no corruption of blood. In Lord de la Warre's Case, 11 Coke 1a, it was resolved by the justices""{{that there was}} a difference betwixt disability personal and temporary and a disability absolute and perpetual, as where one is attainted of treason and felony, that is an absolute and perpetual disability, by corruption of blood, for any of his posterity to claim any inheritance in fee simple, either as heir to him or any ancestor above him, but when one is disabled by Parliament (without any attainder) to claim the dignity for his life, it is a <b>personal</b> <b>disability</b> for his life only, and his heir, after his death, may claim as heir to him or to any ancestor above him.""There is a close analogy between that case and the present.""Without pursuing this discussion further, we repeat, that to hold that any estate or interest remained in Charles S. Wallach after the confiscation and sale of the land in controversy, would defeat the avowed purpose of the confiscation act and the only justification for its enactment, and to hold that the joint resolution was not intended for the benefit of his heirs exclusively, to enable them to take the inheritance after his death, would give preference to the guilty over the innocent.

This study compared the characteristics of five groups of people with psychosis and varying patterns of substance use (n = 1152), including groups entering treatment studies for substance use or smoking, epidemiological samples of substance users and smokers, and people without such problems. Data were drawn from several recent Australian studies using comparable structured interviews and scales. There were moderate group differences in illness and symptom profiles, with substance users tending to have higher depression and reality distortion scores.

Anxiety and depression were scored on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and negative attitudes and beliefs regarding breathlessness and related aspects of respiratory health on a semantic differential scale. Scores for attitudes and beliefs about health and <b>personal</b> <b>disability</b> were pooled to give a general attitude score. Personality was rated on a standard scale. Subjects completed a questionnaire on respiratory symptoms and underwent routine spirometry, measurement ofcarbon monoxide transfer factor for the lung, and a progressive exercise test on a cycle ergometer. Scores for anxiety, depression, and negative mental attitudes were significantly intercorrelated; subjects with disordered personality profiles had above average scores for anxiety and depression. The psychometric scores were associated with clinical grade of breathlessness, lung function, and the physiological response to exercise.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Negative {{attitudes towards}} {{people with disabilities}} persist in our society, {{limiting}} the inclusion {{of people with disabilities}} in a multitude of social roles. Despite existing research on the nature of these attitudes and interventions to improve them, people with disabilities continue to cite social barriers as some of their greatest challenges (Dunn & Burcaw, 2013). Past research has often focused solely on the attitudes of people without disabilities towards those with disabilities, and has failed to involve people that have personal experience with disability in the research process. The present research consisted of two studies that were conducted to examine attitudes toward disability on both a group and interpersonal level, as well as the related factors of participant disability, the demographic factors and disability factors that influence attitudes (contact, age, gender, and type of and visibility of disability), and the impact of disability identity on the attitudes of people with disabilities towards others with disabilities. In addition, the second study examined the effects of education and the social model of disability on attitudes toward people with disabilities. The findings of the first study provide support for the role played by contact in attitudes toward disability and the differential effects of communal and <b>personal</b> <b>disability</b> identity in determining the attitudes of people with disabilities towards others with disabilities. The findings of the second study provide support for the efficacy of an educational intervention that addresses disability from the social model to improve attitudes about disability...|$|E

Methods: As {{part of a large}} two-phase Australian study of psychotic disorders, structured interviews were conducted with a stratified random sample of adults who screened positive for psychosis. Demographic characteristics, social functioning, symptoms, mental health diagnoses, and use of psychiatric and nonpsychiatric services were assessed. Data were analyzed for 858 persons who had an ICD- 10 diagnosis of a psychotic disorder and who had been hospitalized for less than six months during the previous year. Results: People with psychotic disorders had high levels of use of health services, both in absolute terms and relative to people with nonpsychotic disorders. Those with psychotic disorders were estimated to have an average of one contact with health services per week.

40|$|Background Investigations {{on health}} {{differences}} within welfare states between low- and high-socioeconomic groups are mainly conducted in Europe. With {{the aim of}} gaining global insight on the extent welfare regimes influence <b>personal</b> <b>disability</b> for the most vulnerable, we explore how these health differences vary between low- and high-socioeconomic groups. Methods The World Health Survey data were analysed on 199 595 adults from 46 countries using the welfare regime classification developed by Wood and Gough. Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate welfare regime differences in self-reported disability according to individual educational attainment and employment status. Results As compared with the low educated in the European-conservative regime, the odds of having a higher prevalence of disability was found among low-educated people residing in the informal-security regime of South Asia, with OR being 3. 16 (95 % CI 2. 23 to 4. 47). While state-organised regimes seemed to offer more protection against disability to the low educated, the productivist regime of East Asia trailed closely behind, with OR being 1. 10 (95 % CI 0. 76 to 1. 60) for the low educated. Similar findings were also observed in the unemployed. Conclusions State-organised regimes of Europe and the productivist regime of East Asia seem to contain protecting features against disability for all citizens and especially for the most vulnerable. Apart from the productivist regime of East Asia, the low educated and the unemployed seem to carry the greatest health burden within more insecure regimes, highlighting a deficiency in social provisions within these regimes aimed at protecting the most vulnerabl...|$|E

3000|$|A fully powered {{and longer}} {{clinical}} trial will address certain limitations. The {{first of these}} is that the study {{was carried out in}} a single centre; thus our findings may not be generalizable to the rest of Pakistan or indeed the rest of the South Asian population. Second, as this was a pilot trial, our sample size was small and not powered to detect efficacy of the intervention. It is important to interpret the effect sizes relating to clinical outcomes cautiously since most outcome measures were self-report scales and may be at risk of recall bias, social desirability bias and errors in self-observation. Moreover, using TAU as a control is likely to inflate the effect sizes for the intervention. Future studies should consider using attention placebo controls such as unstructured social support or befriending to minimize the risk of bias. In order to determine reliable data regarding the clinical efficacy of CaPE, future trials should also match groups for potential confounding factors such as concomitant pharmacological treatment, duration of illness, and type of disorder (i.e., type I or type II). Sub-types of bipolar disorder differ in terms of illness severity, clinical and social outcomes, response to treatments, and <b>personal</b> <b>disability,</b> and these differences may have had an impact on our findings. Furthermore, as we excluded patients with a psychiatric co-morbidity, our findings are not generalizable to those bipolar patients with comorbidities.

40|$|Depression and {{diabetes}} are both common chronic disorders affecting people worldwide. Diabetes is characterised as a metabolic disorder often involving laborious self-management reduced health-related {{quality of life}} and often the prospect of diabetes related complications. Depression on the other hand, is a mood disorder associated with high levels of <b>personal</b> <b>disability,</b> lost quality of life, multiple morbidity and an increased risk of mortality. The adverse effects of depression may be especially detrimental in people with diabetes. This thesis presents the results of a programme of work beginning with two systematic reviews which demonstrate that the prevalence of depression is almost doubled in those with type 2 diabetes relative to those without and in addition is associated with worsened health related quality of life in those with comorbidity. The second phase of the research involved examining ethnic differences in the prevalence of depression as well as associations between depression and glycaemic control in secondary care patients with diabetes. Although depression did not explain ethnic differences in glycaemic control, the findings suggested that depression may be under-diagnosed in South Asians with diabetes. A need was highlighted to examine the prevalence of screen detected depression in a multiethnic population with type 2 diabetes relative to a suitable control group. The results from the final phase of the research concluded that although the prevalence of depression was not higher in primary care patients with type 2 diabetes compared to those without diabetes, the prevalence of depression in people with diabetes is nonetheless high, particularly in South Asians. Furthermore, findings from the final stage of the research conclude that depression is seriously under-diagnosed in people with type 2 diabetes, particularly in South Asians. The findings emphasise the need to improve the detection and management of depression to reduce inequalities in both depression {{and diabetes}} care...|$|E
40|$|Coronary {{heart disease}} (CHD) {{is a leading}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the industrialised world, and places a heavy burden on society in terms of <b>personal</b> <b>disability</b> and health care costs. The first signs of CHD often present acutely as a myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack. Survivors of a heart attack remain vulnerable to poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL), further cardiac events, and increased morbidity due to a progression of CHD. Thus, the implementation of interventions to reduce these risks is an important public health strategy. To date, secondary prevention and rehabilitation efforts post-AMI focus primarily on the patient. However, it is argued that recovery from AMI occurs within a social context, and that risk reduction strategies are likely to be enhanced if interventions take into account the impact of the event on {{the quality of life of}} patients and their partners. Evidence from a review of couple relationship literature indicates that a significant proportion of couples experiences poor HRQOL (i. e., physical and emotional wellbeing) when coping with stressful life events, and that interactive aspects of a couple relationship (i. e., dyadic functioning and behaviour) are associated with individual well-being at such a time. Information from studies of couples dealing with recovery from heart attack is sparse, but tends to reflect the findings from the broader literature. Further research is required with post-AMI couples, though, as there are a number of shortcomings associated with the existing evidence. For instance, it is derived from studies conducted with, mostly small, samples of convenience; many different instruments are used to collect the data; and no studies specifically measure HRQOL. Analytically, most evidence is obtained with univariate and bivariate statistics, and data are analysed as groups of patients or partners, as opposed to dyads. Where multivariable analyses are undertaken a number of bivariate relationships are no longer significant after accounting for covariates such as age and gender; and few researchers investigate predictive associations between dyadic functioning/behaviour and HRQOL outcomes. Finally, there is a paucity of information from comparative analyses. Thus, it is not known whether the well-being of post-AMI couples over time is better than, similar to, or worse than, for example, that in the general population. The research program underpinning this thesis, the QUT-AMI Project, comprised two studies designed to address these methodological issues. The first was an observational, cross-sectional, pilot study conducted in 1998 with 26 post-AMI couples. The main investigation was a prospective cohort study of 93 post-AMI couples undertaken in 1999 - 2000. In both studies the samples comprised a consecutive series of adult males younger than 75 years who had experienced a first AMI, and their female partners. The average couple in both studies was middle-aged, had been married for many years, and both members of the dyad were working at the time of the heart attack. Prospective participants were identified in major clinical centres that admit cardiac patients, and couples were recruited to the project soon after the patient's heart attack. Clinical data were collected in hospital. Further data were collected with self-administered questionnaires during a home visit at 1 month (pilot and main study), and by mailed questionnaire or during a home visit at 6 months(main study) after the heart attack. The pilot study was undertaken to test recruitment and data collection procedures in preparation for the second (main) study, measure couples' HRQOL at 1 month after the event using the SF- 36, and qualitatively investigate life issues for couples coping with recovery from AMI. In the main study couples' HRQOL outcomes were measured at 1 and 6 months post-AMI using the SF- 36, and examined for changes over that time. The outcomes were also compared with those from matched population norms to estimate the impact of a heart attack on couples' HRQOL during the early and later recovery period. Additionally, the following relationships were investigated to determine the extent to which:* patients' dyadic functioning (e. g. happiness/satisfaction with relationship, measured with the Marital Adjustment Scale) and use of dyadic behaviour (e. g., hiding concerns and negative feelings from the other member of the dyad, measured with the Protective Buffering Scale) at 1 month predicted patients' emotional well-being at 6 months post-AMI;* partners' dyadic functioning and behaviour at 1 month predicted partners' emotional well-being at 6 months post-AMI;* patients' and partners' dyadic functioning at 1 month predicted patients' or partners' emotional well-being at 6 months post-AMI; and* patients' and partners' dyadic behaviour at 1 month predicted patients' or partners' emotional well-being at 6 months post-AMI. Exploratory analyses were also undertaken to determine the effect of dyadic discrepancies in functioning and behaviour, at 1 month after the heart attack, on patients' and partners' emotional well-being at 6 months after the event. Important findings were as follows:* At 1 month after an AMI the HRQOL of couples is impaired. The major impact is on physical well-being for patients, and emotional well-being for their partners. * In general, couples' HRQOL improves between 1 and 6 months after an AMI. * At 6 months after an AMI, the HRQOL of average couples is similar to that of their peers in the normal population. * There are subgroup variations in the quality of life of post-AMI couples, and these are associated with age, clinically poor physical health, and depression. * The combination of patients' and partners' use of dyadic behaviour at 1 month after an AMI explains 7 % of the variation in patients' emotional well-being at 6 months after the event, after adjustment for patients' concurrent physical wellbeing and prior levels of emotional well-being, as well as duration of couple relationships. * The combination of partners' perceptions of dyadic functioning and use of dyadic behaviour at 1 month after an AMI explains 5 % of the variation in partners' emotional well-being at 6 months after the event, after adjustment for partners' concurrent physical well-being and prior levels of emotional well-being, as well as duration of couples' relationships. * Patients have poorer emotional well-being at 6 months after an AMI if partners use dyadic behaviour infrequently at 1 month after the event. * Partners have poorer emotional well-being at 6 months after an AMI if they are not satisfied/unhappy with the functioning of their relationships at 1 month after the event. Adjusted exploratory analyses, undertaken to determine the extent to which dyadic discrepancies in perceptions of functioning or use of protective buffering behaviour, predict emotional well-being, show that patients who are less satisfied/unhappier with functioning than their partners at 1 month after an AMI have poor emotional wellbeing at 6 months after the event; patients who use the behaviour more frequently than their partners at 1 month after an AMI have poor emotional well-being at 6 months after the event; and partners who are less satisfied/unhappier with functioning than their patients at 1 month after an AMI have poor emotional well-being at 6 months after the event. The evidence from the QUT-AMI Project supports the proposition that the interaction that occurs within a couple relationship, combined with individual characteristics of members of a dyad, influences the extent to which a heart attack impacts on couples' HRQOL. It is argued that it is not enough to merely focus on implementing secondary prevention strategies with post-AMI patients. Given that poor emotional well-being is known to predict adverse cardiac events, and premature mortality due to cardiac disease, it is recommended that a couple-focused intervention designed to meet specific needs should be implemented with at-risk couples as a public health strategy to improve not only the patients' quality of life but also that of his partner. Further research is recommended to determine the extent to which such an intervention improves post-AMI couples' quality of life...|$|E

Any opinions expressed here are solely {{those of the authors}} and not of any sponsoring This study explores transitions between homeless and domiciled states. It describes the timing of departures from and returns to homelessness, and it tests theoretical propositions linking individual attributes and experiences to these transitions. Four theoretical frameworks guide the analyses: institutional disaffiliation, human capital deficiencies, <b>personal</b> <b>disabilities,</b> and acculturation. The data come from a longitudinal study of homeless individuals in Minneapolis. Various individual attributes are linked with leaving homelessness, including recent employment, welfare receipt, job training, identification with other homeless people, and homeless history. Fewer attributes are linked with returns to homelessness: work history and gender. These findings provide some evidence for existing explanations for homeless transitions, and they suggest promising avenues for further research on the dynamics of homelessness. The Dynamics of Homelessness Empirical studies of homeless people date back at least to the nineteenth century, and may now number well into the hundreds. These studies have served the important purpose of informin...|$|R

Drawing on in-depth qualitative data, this article critically examines disability geography as a subfield where the personal is highly valued. The value and the risks inherent in this personal approach will be evaluated, including the usefulness of being an 'insider' and the difficulties of being reflexive and critically making use of one's positionality. The article concludes with reflections regarding how disability geography can confront its marginal status, appealing to researchers who claim no experience of disability while also supporting and encouraging those with <b>personal</b> experiences of <b>disability</b> to participate in the field...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{assessed}} {{the extent to}} which the use of point-prevalence samples biases conclusions drawn about homeless people. METHODS: Three data sets and published research were used to examine the degree to which conditions leading to point-prevalence bias (turnover in the homeless population, variability in the persistence of homelessness, and associations between personal characteristics and persistence) characterize the homeless population. Results were compared from point-prevalence studies concerning persistence of homelessness and characteristics of homeless people with those from a study of formerly homeless people. RESULTS: Conditions leading to point-prevalence bias strongly characterize the homeless population. Moreover, profiles of homeless people differed dramatically between point-prevalence studies and the study of formerly homeless people. In the former, average duration of homelessness was longer, and samples included higher proportions of men, minorities, non-high school graduates, and people with histories of psychiatric hospitalization, incarceration, and detoxification. CONCLUSIONS: Reliance on point-prevalence samples, when such samples are generalized beyond the currently homeless population, leads to overestimations of the persistence of homelessness, the demographic distinctiveness of the homeless population, and the prevalence of <b>personal</b> <b>disabilities</b> and deviant lifestyles among homeless people...|$|R
