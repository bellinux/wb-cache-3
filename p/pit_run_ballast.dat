25|$|After {{construction}} was complete in February 1910, {{and a new}} engine was installed, McCurdy readied the aircraft for flight, taking it out on some ground <b>runs.</b> <b>Ballast</b> {{was added to the}} tail and on 25 March 1910, a test flight off the ice at Baddeck Bay succeeded in three of the four wheels coming off the ground. McCurdy ended the flight in order for modification to be made for future testing, including adding more incidence to the wings. Shortly after, the ice melted and no further attempts were made to fly the Oionus I.|$|R
50|$|The <b>PIT</b> <b>ran</b> Wodié as its {{candidate}} {{in both the}} 1995 and 2000 presidential elections. He was the only candidate standing against President Henri Konan Bédié in the October 1995 presidential election, which was boycotted by other opposition parties; he won 3.52% of the votes. In the October 2000 presidential election, Wodié placed third with 5.7% of the votes.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{situated}} in the eastern Harz mountain range, approximately 8 km south of neighbouring Wernigerode. The former municipal area comprised Elbingerode proper {{as well as the}} villages of Königshütte and Rübeland. The surrounding mountains were the site of numerous ore mines and ironworks, today the Drei Kronen & Ehrt mine and the Büchenberg <b>Pit,</b> <b>run</b> as show mines, are popular tourist destinations.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Semafo {{announced}} it had discovered two new possible mine sites on its concessions, {{to the east}} and west of its current mines. Sikia 1, 1 km in length, is southeast of Libiri pit, while Libiri Plateau, northeast of the Libiri <b>pit,</b> <b>runs</b> 500 meters. It is thought the immediate are could produce pits 10 km east and west of the current site.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{works at}} the time of the April 1863 battle were two earthen forts, Fort Cobun and Fort Wade. Atop Point of Rock, Fort Cobun was the {{stronger}} fortification due to its elevation and its parapet, 40 feet thick. Fort Wade sat only 20 feet above the river, approximately three quarters of a mile downstream and a quarter of mile from the water's edge. Rifle <b>pits</b> <b>ran</b> along the ridge connecting the two works.|$|R
50|$|The mine's two pits {{are open}} pits, 3 km from one another, both around 5 km {{north of the}} Burkina Faso border, and 95 km west-north-west from Niamey. The larger Samira Pit and the Libiri <b>pit</b> <b>run</b> east-west along the site, with Libiri pit to the east. The ore {{processing}} is done by crushing, grinding, and carbon leaching (Gold cyanidation), which requires a pipeline pumping water from the nearby Sirba River, {{to the east of}} the site, as well as a large reservoir and waste pits.|$|R
60|$|Now she {{saw that}} down the <b>pit</b> <b>ran</b> another ladderlike stair of stone, very narrow and precipitous. Without {{hesitation}} she began its descent. Down she went and down--one hundred steps, two hundred steps, two hundred and seventy-five steps, {{and all the way}} wherever the dust had gathered the man's and the woman's footprints ran before her. There was a double line of them, one line going down and the other line returning. Those that returned were the last, for often they appeared over those that descended. Why had these dead people returned, Benita wondered.|$|R

40|$|In November of 1966, an {{investigation}} of the rigid Class I asphalt treated base specification, requiring 70 per cent crushed limestone, was initiated. It was felt that {{it might be possible to}} modify the need for crushed particles, in the construction of basis on heavy duty roads, at a savings, by using more local materials, without sacrificing strength and/or durability. This is a short study on typical sources of <b>pit</b> <b>run</b> gravel, with various percentages of limestone. It is conducted with an eye open to the possibility that our specifications may be modified. The possibility that further investigation may be desirable is not ignored...|$|R
5000|$|Iolaus and Lydia {{continue}} to escape while {{being chased by}} dogs tracking their scent. The men finally {{catch up with the}} pair. Working together, they manage to fend off some of the men and run to hide in a nearby cave. While hiding out in the cave a Hydra appears, Hercules runs to help his friend, but Nemesis stops him saying, [...] "Only Iolaus can redeem himself". In the cave, Iolaus fights the Hydra with a torch while Lydia escapes. When one of the men enters the cave, Iolaus briefly fight him and then throwing the torch into the Hydra's <b>pit</b> <b>runs</b> from the cave.|$|R
25|$|A short branch {{was made}} {{at the end of}} 1880 or early in 1881 to join the NBR Muiredge branch, and a {{connection}} from the new Rosie <b>pit,</b> which <b>ran</b> as a high level siding parallel to, and above, the W line.|$|R
50|$|The tracks run on an {{embankment}} at {{a height}} of 14 metres in an east-west direction, parallel to the A 3, which runs immediately to the north. The through tracks, 2 and 3, run on slab track with UIC-60 (60 kg/m) rails. The three platform tracks and the freight tracks, however, <b>run</b> on <b>ballast.</b> All four long-distance tracks (1-4) are equipped with the Linienzugbeeinflussung automatic train protection system.|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} bismuth on Ge(001) {{has been studied}} using {{scanning}} tunneling microscopy. Deposition of one-monolayer (ML) Bi at room temperature and subsequent annealing at 500 K results {{in the formation of}} a well-ordered (2 × n) vacancy line network oriented perpendicular to the dimer rows. Deposition of two-monolayer Bi under the same conditions results in the formation of square-shaped pits with depths up to 10 ML. The edges of these <b>pits</b> <b>run</b> along the two dimer row directions. Careful analysis of these pits reveal that they mainly consist of (111) and (113) facets. We argue that the morphological transition from the vacancy line network to the square shaped pits pattern is driven by a modification of the surface strain tensor...|$|R
50|$|Up front, {{there were}} no {{concerns}} for Scott Dixon, who coasted easily to victory. Behind him, however, last lap drama occurred when second place runner James Hinchcliffe, who had moved up in the order as others <b>pitted,</b> <b>ran</b> out of fuel and coasted to a halt only two turns from the finish. Josef Newgarden moved by to take second, while Castroneves managed to take the last step of the podium despite his pit stop. Conor Daly, despite running out of fuel, came across the line fourth, making him both the highest finishing Honda and highest finishing rookie in the race. Sébastien Bourdais rounded out the top five. Hinchcliffe dropped {{all the way down}} the order to 18th following his heartbreaking finish.|$|R
5000|$|Nailsea's early economy {{relied on}} coal mining, which began {{as early as}} the 16th century. The {{earliest}} recorded date for coal mining in Nailsea was 1507 when coal was being transported to light fires at Yatton. [...] By the late 1700s the Golden Valley area of the town had a large number of <b>pits</b> <b>run</b> by a consortium by Peter Cox, Joseph Whitchurch and Isaac White which was formed in 1786 and known as White and Co. John Robert Lucas joined to obtain coal for the nearby Nailsea Glassworks. Remains of the old pits, most of which had closed down by the late 19th century as mining capital migrated to the richer seams of South Wales, are still visible around the town.|$|R
25|$|After having {{departed}} from Hamburg on 3 May 1855, the vessel sailed to Australian waters another time and arrived in Melbourne in September the same year. Messrs. E. Visbeck and C. Wegener were recorded as passengers {{in the cabin}} and eighty-seven (unnamed) in the steerage. From Melbourne, the Iserbrook set sail for Valparaiso via Sir Charles Hardy Islands on 8 September. It carried part of its original cargo from Hamburg, and partly <b>run</b> in <b>ballast.</b>|$|R
50|$|It was at {{this very}} spot that French king Ludwig XV watched the {{shelling}} of Freiburg by his troops in 1744 during War of the Austrian Succession. A Cannonball that nearly hit him is immured in one of Lorretokapelle walls. Not far to the northwest of this point at the west side, one {{can still see the}} former quarry from which the stones used to construct the Freiburg Munster were excavated. Other quarries and clay pits can be found at Lorettoberg. Some were already used in the Middle Ages. One remaining clay pit, for example, is the lower Schlierbergweiher. During a detonation in 1896, the hydrophilic layer of the clay pit was damaged and the <b>pit</b> <b>ran</b> full of water, which is why the use of it was abandoned.|$|R
50|$|Coole Lane, which connects Nantwich {{with the}} A525 near Audlem, runs north-south through the parish {{and is the}} major road. Brine <b>Pits</b> Lane <b>runs</b> from Coole Lane to Brinepits Farm. The A529 lies {{to the east of}} the parish. The South Cheshire Way long-distance {{footpath}} runs east-west through the parish.|$|R
50|$|Briscoe knocked {{himself out}} of the Indianapolis 500 along with Danica Patrick when Briscoe came out of the <b>pits</b> and <b>ran</b> into Patrick tearing up her {{suspension}} and tearing the front end of Briscoe's car.

40|$|How did {{the needs}} such as {{ice and snow}} and cooling food and water supply in the Ottoman Empire? What kind of {{standards}} were formed for the snow pits and how were these snow <b>pits</b> <b>run?</b> Who were the officiers that dealt with this job at Topkapi Palace? How were ice and snow distributed and to whom were they disributed at the palace? Since ice and snow were used to cool food and water, some standardizations were formed to provide necessary hygiene. Becasue this job was a sector, it was done for a living {{by a lot of}} people. In this paper, with the help of archive sources, we will both handle subjects of spaces, supply, transport,prize and regulation of the functioning of snow and ice and try to find out their prevalence in terms of tradesmen and consumption. ...|$|R
50|$|The Surprise (named Victoria at the time) began trial <b>runs</b> as a <b>ballast</b> {{locomotive}} on the London and Birmingham Railway in January 1838, {{then transferred}} to the Grand Junction Railway.

60|$|The daylight, {{which was}} very clear and grey, showed them a riband of white {{footpath}} wandering among the gorse. It passed some {{hundred yards from the}} <b>pit,</b> and <b>ran</b> the whole length of the clearing, east and west. By the line of its course, Dick judged it should lead more or less directly to the Moat House.|$|R
50|$|In {{the fourth}} {{week of the}} 1985 season, the Gamblers met Davis' Denver Gold {{in the first game}} ever to <b>pit</b> two <b>run</b> and shoot offenses. The two offenses showed only small {{similarities}} as Jenkins employed various new tactics such as motioning receivers out of the backfield and going into empty sets. The Gamblers won 36-17.|$|R
50|$|Union Brig. General Thomas Ewing, deputy {{commander}} of the District of St. Louis and a brother-in-law to William T. Sherman, had arrived at Fort Davidson with 200 Iowa infantry to augment the small Federal force already there. He was scouting the route Price might take towards St. Louis when he got word that the Ironton-St. Louis railroad behind him had been cut by Confederate cavalry. Despite being outnumbered ten-to-one, he decided to stand and fight. The fort occupied a strong defensive position, with hexagonal walls nine feet high and ten feet thick, surrounded by a dry moat nine feet deep. Two long rifle <b>pits</b> <b>ran</b> out from the walls, while a reinforced board fence topped the earthworks. Access could only be had through a drawbridge on the structure's southeastern corner. A 300 yd cleared field of fire extended in every direction beyond the walls; any enemy approach would prove extremely hazardous.|$|R

5000|$|By the 1880s coal {{production}} declined as the various <b>pits</b> either <b>ran</b> out of coal or were flooded and subsequently closed. In 1896 the main pump at Dunkerton which maintained the canal water level failed. The resultant lowering in level meant that only small loads could be transported. A factor which reduced {{revenue from the}} canal still further. The declining income meant that the canal company {{could not afford to}} pay for a replacement pump.|$|R
2500|$|With {{automated}} starters such as glow starters, {{a failing}} tube will cycle endlessly, flickering as the lamp quickly goes out because the emission mix {{is insufficient to}} keep the lamp current high {{enough to keep the}} glow starter open. This <b>runs</b> the <b>ballast</b> at higher temperature. Some more advanced starters time out in this situation, and do not attempt repeated starts until power is reset. Some older systems used a thermal over-current trip to detect repeated starting attempts and disable the circuit until manually reset. [...] The switch contacts in glow starters are subject to wear and inevitably fail eventually, so the starter is manufactured as a plug-in replaceable unit.|$|R

5000|$|When Crash Holly won the belt, he {{introduced}} the [...] "24/7 rule" [...] which said the belt {{was to be}} defended at all times, {{as long as a}} referee was present. This allowed for many comic relief moments, such as the belt changing hands while the champion was asleep, and The Headbangers chasing Crash Holly around an amusement park in Brooklyn (Holly eventually escaped from a ball <b>pit</b> and <b>ran</b> from the building, still the champion).|$|R
30|$|Another {{variant of}} the zai is the Chololo pits, a method in which pits with a {{diameter}} of 22  cm and a depth of 30  cm are used. The <b>pits</b> <b>run</b> parallel to the contour and have an in-row space of 60 and inter-row spacing of 90  cm. Ashes (to expel termites), farmyard manure and crop residues are added into the pit and this is covered by a little soil, and some space is left to hold runoff water. Some of the soil that was excavated when making the pit is {{used to make a}} small bund around the hole. One or two seeds of maize or millet or sorghum are planted per hole and yields have been reported to triple even during very dry years (Mati 2005). A larger version of the zai is the ‘five by nine’ pit, which has surface dimensions of 60 x 60 and a depth of 60  cm. The pits are larger than zai and “five by nine” refers to the five maize seeds (for dry areas) or nine maize seeds (for wet areas) planted at the pit diagonals. This type of pit can be re-used for a period of up to 2  years (Mati 2005).|$|R
