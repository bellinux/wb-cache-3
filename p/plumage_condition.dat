40|$|Title of the paper: Evaluation {{of small}} group housing systems and {{furnished}} cages concerning keel bone deformities, <b>plumage</b> <b>condition,</b> claw length und body weight in layer strains Lohmann Selected Leghorn and Lohmann Brown Small group housing systems (Eurovent 625 +a-EU) and furnished cages (Aviplus und Eurovent 625 A-EU) were evaluated for {{the occurrence of}} keel bone deformities, <b>plumage</b> <b>condition,</b> claw length and body weight. The examinations were performed in two layer strains, Lohmann Selected Leghorn (LSL) and Lohmann Brown (LB), over two laying periods. In addition, the effects of layer strain, month of laying period, rearing method, group- size and body weight on these traits were tested. The assessments based on a scoring system comprising the scores 1 (very severely defective part of the body) to 4 (intact part of the body) were performed every three months during the laying period. Examinations of keel bone condition and measurements of body weight were performed {{in a total of}} 864 hens, claw length and <b>plumage</b> <b>condition</b> were examined in a total of 720 hens. Housing system showed a significant effect on the incidence of keel bone deformities and claw length. <b>Plumage</b> <b>condition</b> was significantly affected by group size, whereas <b>plumage</b> <b>condition</b> was worst in groups of 20 hens in Aviplus and in groups of 10 hens in Eurovent 625 A-EU. Concerning claw length there were significant differences between diverse claw abrasives. The strongest abrasion was found in groups with two abrasive blocks, whereas perforated metal plates led to the least abrasion. Month of laying period showed a significant effect on each examined trait with a decrease in keel bone and <b>plumage</b> <b>condition</b> and an increase in claw length and body weight during the laying period...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePreen glands {{exist in}} almost every bird species and several non-exclusive {{functions}} have been proposed for this gland and the oils that it produces. One function generally admitted is that the oily secretions of the preen gland would provide a waterproofing layer when spread over feathers. Alternatively, several authors have proposed that plumage waterproofness is mostly due to the spatial micro-structure of feathers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine, by manipulating the access to the preen gland, the effect of the preen oil on the plumage waterproofness and condition. To explore this question, we carried out two independent experiments where we temporarily blocked access to the preen gland secretions with a removable mechanism in one group of captive mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), whilst a second group of birds had access to gland secretions. In a long-term experiment (3 months of treatment) and a short-term experiment (10 days), we measured plumage water retention and condition. After 3 months without access to preen glands, we found a significant decrease of <b>plumage</b> <b>condition</b> and an associated increase in plumage water retention. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between <b>plumage</b> <b>condition</b> and water retention ability. In contrast, after 10 days of treatment, no significant effect was found on <b>plumage</b> <b>condition</b> and water retention. Our study shows that preen oil acts to maintain <b>plumage</b> <b>condition</b> and suggests that feather microstructure is essential to maintain plumage waterproofness...|$|E
40|$|The carcass {{and meat}} quality of three {{different}} commercial chicken genotypes reared according to the organic system and slaughtered at two different ages (70 and 81 days) were compared. The used genotypes were Naked Neck (CN 1), Kabir (KR 4) and Ross 308 (R). All animals were raised in the facilities of a big Italian company, in production units of 3000 birds. Before slaughtering, <b>plumage</b> <b>conditions,</b> foot pad dermatitis as well as qualitative traits of carcasses, such as skin damage {{and the presence of}} breast blisters, were registered (n= 50). Naked Neck birds showed the best <b>plumage</b> <b>conditions</b> at both ages; the other genotypes had similar body conditions showing a dramatically worsening at the end of rearing cycle (81 days), mainly at breast level. The carcass conformation showed differences mainly for the CN 1 genotype, which was more slender with higher proportions of head, neck and legs; thus, ready-to-cook-carcass yield was lower. The meat of CN 1 chickens showed lower levels of lipids, pH and brightness values, but higher index of redness. Ross 308 genotype showed a bad welfare status even at 70 days, confirming that the rearing of this strain should not be permitted in organic systems. In conclusion, this study indicates that genotype deeply affects performance, welfare and qualitative characteristics of meat. Regarding the slaughtering age, although the inconsistency of European Commission rules which authorise the reduction of slaughtering age in less mature strains, at 70 days chickens show higher feed efficiency and thinness of carcass and meat...|$|R

[...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildlife, 2011 Male Steller???s jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) display structurally-based non-iridescent blue plumage which {{reflects}} {{light in the}} ultraviolet (UV) range, ornamental crests and colored patches. The parasite-mediated handicap hypothesis argues that ornaments are costly to produce and can be influenced by susceptibility to parasites. Consequently, the extent of ornament expression can act as honest indicators of quality, which are assessed by mates or competitors. I quantified structurally-based plumage color and ornament size in relation to individual condition (feather growth rate) and occurrence of disease caused by a parasite infestation (knemidokoptic mange) in wild male jays. I then experimentally reduced parasite load prior to molt and quantified the relative change in <b>plumage</b> and <b>condition.</b> Using reflectance spectrometry to quantify feather color, I found that birds with heavier body mass, independent of body size, had higher feather growth rates which suggest that birds which grew their plumage faster were in better condition during the post-breeding molt. I also found birds in better condition had lower hues (i. e., reflected shorter wavelengths, possibly displaying a more intense, brilliant blue color), suggesting a possible condition-dependent production of feather color. I found no support for the parasite-mediated handicap hypothesis, as UV reflectance {{was positively related to}} the occurrence of disease. I detected no effect of experimental treatment on <b>plumage</b> ornaments or <b>condition.</b> In conclusion, I found no evidence in support of the parasite-mediated handicap hypotheses, but found some evidence for condition-dependant development of structurally based blue plumage in adult male Steller???s jays.

40|$|The first {{limiting}} nutrients for poultry are the sulphur containing amino acids, particularly methionine. To fulfil {{the recommended}} requirement, conventional diets are supplemented with synthetic methionine. Since {{this is not}} allowed in organic production it becomes important {{to have access to}} alternative high quality protein feed ingredients. The aim of this thesis was to investigate whether blue mussels (Mytilis edulis) {{could be used as a}} protein source in diets for organic poultry and determine whether the amount of fish meal commonly used today in organic diets could be replaced with mussel meal. Four experiments during both short time periods and during whole production cycles were conducted to evaluate production performance, egg quality and animal health when using mussel meal in the diets. Additionally, the effects of the mussel toxin okadaic acid (oa) were evaluated. oa is a toxin that unpredictably appears in mussels some years. The experiments were performed both in laying hens and in broiler chickens and for laying hens, both in furnished cages and floor systems. Inclusion levels of mussel meal in the diets of up to 12 % for broiler chickens and 15 % for laying hens were used. Mussel meal in the diets did not affect production performance for laying hens or broiler chickens in any of the experiments. oa at moderate level used in diets for laying hens did not negatively affect the birds and no oa was detected in the egg yolk. When extremely toxic mussels were included in the diet, broiler chickens got diarrhoea, lower growth rate and feed intake than birds fed the control diet. Egg yolk pigmentation differed significantly between diets in all experiments with laying hens. The egg yolk was more darkly coloured when the hens were fed a diet containing mussel meal. Off flavour and off odour did not differ in any eggs. In one experiment <b>plumage</b> <b>conditions</b> was evaluated and an improved total score was observed when mussel meal was included in the diet. These results indicate that mussels may be a good and high quality protein source for poultry and may replace fish meal in organic diets for laying hens and broiler chickens...|$|R

40|$|Feather pecking {{and high}} {{mortality}} levels are significant welfare problems in non-cage housing systems for laying hens. The {{aim of this}} study was to identify husbandry-related risk factors for feather damage, mortality, and egg laying performance in laying hens housed in the multi-tier non-cage housing systems known as aviaries. Factors tested included type of system flooring, degree of red mite infestation, and access to free-range areas. Information on housing characteristics, management, and performance in Belgian aviaries (N = 47 flocks) were obtained from a questionnaire, farm records, and farm visits. <b>Plumage</b> <b>condition</b> and pecking wounds were scored in 50 randomly selected 60 -week-old hens per flock. Associations between <b>plumage</b> <b>condition,</b> wounds, performance, mortality, and possible risk factors were investigated using a linear model with a stepwise model selection procedure. Many flocks exhibited a poor <b>plumage</b> <b>condition</b> and a high prevalence of wounds, with considerable variation between flocks. Better <b>plumage</b> <b>condition</b> was found in wire mesh aviaries (P < 0. 001), in aviaries with no red mite infestation (P = 0. 004), and in free-range systems (P = 0. 011) compared to plastic slatted aviaries, in houses with red mite infestations, and those without a free-range area. Furthermore, hens in aviaries with wire mesh flooring had fewer wounds on the back (P = 0. 006) and vent (P = 0. 009), reduced mortality (P = 0. 003), and a better laying performance (P = 0. 013) as compared to hens in aviaries with plastic slatted flooring. Flocks with better feather cover had lower levels of mortality (P < 0. 001). Red mite infestations were more common in plastic slatted aviaries (P = 0. 043). Other risk factors associated with <b>plumage</b> <b>condition</b> were genotype, number of diet changes, and the presence of nest perches. Wire mesh flooring in particular seems to have several health, welfare, and performance benefits in comparison to plastic slats, possibly related to decreased feather pecking, better hygiene, and fewer red mite infestations.

40|$|Fibres are not digested by fowls, {{but their}} impact on {{digestive}} physiology, nutrient metabolism and intestinal microflora can be substantial. Analytical shortcomings have historically contributed to different notions on the significance of fibres, but modern techniques now enable us to better discriminate between various fractions of fibre and relate them {{with the performance of}} poultry. The four present studies examined relationships between different qualities and means of providing fibres, and the functionality of broiler chickens and laying hens. In broiler chickens, increasing the dietary levels of insoluble fibres stimulated fat and protein digestion, but not in a dose-dependent manner. In the small intestine, these effects were mirrored in altered tissue morphology and luminal microflora composition. Moreover, addressing the negative effects of soluble fibres in wheat on digestion by adding a xylanase to the diet improved feed utilization. These effects were not mirrored by macroscopic or microscopic changes of the small intestine. Effects {{similar to those of the}} xylanase were achieved by adding a protease, but not a coccidiostat, to the diet. There were no signs of the effects of the two enzymes being additive. In laying hens, supplementary roughage reduced beak-inflicted injuries and improved feed efficiency; the latter finding likely reflecting better <b>plumage</b> <b>conditions.</b> Increased dietary levels of fibres and fat reduced the liver fat and tended to improve feed efficiency; the latter result probably explained by beneficial effects of added fat on digestion. The diet with more fat and fibres also impaired the hygienic conditions in the stable, presumably due to the fibre fraction being mainly soluble in nature. Experimental lines of hens predisposed to perform severe feather pecking preferred a diet supplemented with spelt hulls more than corresponding hens not predisposed to perform severe feather pecking. This finding supported previous indications that injurious pecking correlates with the fibre content of the feed. It was concluded that the significance of fibres in poultry nutrition largely depends on the quality of fibres. Whereas soluble fibres primarily acted detrimentally on the functionality of the birds, insoluble fibres tended to act in the opposite direction. In poultry nutrition experiments, however, it remains difficult to separate the effects of increasing amounts of fibrous feedstuffs from those of simultaneous dietary fat supplementation, nutrient dilution or ingestion of fibrous materials such as litter. ...|$|R
40|$|To mimic {{airborne}} immune challenges, layer hens were intratracheally and concurrently challenged {{with various}} {{doses of the}} protein antigen human serum albumin (HuSA) and the pathogen-associated molecular pattern lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 7 and 13 wk of age.

On the other hand, a high dosage of LPS was related to comb damage. These results suggest that stimulation of specific (humoral) immune responses (to HuSA) rather than innate responses (to LPS) {{at a young age}} may predispose layers for feather pecking (FP) behavior at later ages. Involvement of immune mechanisms in FP or vent damage may differ. Predisposal for FP behavior by specific immunity can have consequences for health and vaccine managemen...|$|R
40|$|In male birds, {{size and}} {{blackness}} of melanin-based ornaments may signal competitive ability and quality. Testosterone {{is an important}} physiological mediator of these signals as these ornaments are testosterone dependent. Experimental manipulation of circulating testosterone in females suggests that similar mechanisms are at work in plumage ornaments of females. However, hormone manipulations typically result in testosterone levels that {{are far higher than}} physiological concentrations experienced by females. Thus, it remains unclear whether natural variation of testosterone levels would be sufficient to generate variation in female plumage coloration. A signaling value of plumage ornamentation is particularly important in females of sex-role reversed species, in which females are the more competitive sex. We examined the relationship between <b>plumage</b> coloration, body <b>condition,</b> and circulating testosterone in female barred buttonquails (Turnix suscitator), a classically polyandrous species. Even though female testosterone levels were low, they were strongly positively related with body condition and the size and blackness of the melanin throat patch. In males, no such relationships were apparent, suggesting that females may have an enhanced sensitivity for testosterone or its metabolites. These unique results reveal that a hormonal mechanism may be involved in sex-role reversal in this species. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

The birds were raised on deep litter in the first 4 weeks, and later they were raised in battery cages for the remaining 4 weeks. Tonic immobility of the birds was determined between 0 and 600 seconds. Blood parameters were also determined. Results obtained indicated that generally, tonic immobility was averagely good (less than 300 seconds) with birds fed with feed type 4 having the best (shortest) tonic immobility.

40|$|Background: Feather pecking {{is a major}} welfare {{issue in}} laying hen {{industry}} that leads to mortality. Due to a ban on conventional cages in the EU and on beak trimming in some countries of the EU, feather pecking will become an even bigger problem. Its severity depends both on the victim receiving pecking and on its group mates inflicting pecking (indirect effects), which together determine <b>plumage</b> <b>condition</b> of the victim. <b>Plumage</b> <b>condition</b> may depend, therefore, on both the direct genetic effect of an individual itself and on the indirect genetic effects of its group mates. Here, we present estimated genetic parameters for direct and indirect effects on <b>plumage</b> <b>condition</b> of different body regions in two purebred layer lines, and estimates of genetic correlations between body regions. Methods: Feather condition scores (FCS) were recorded at 40 weeks of age for neck, back, rump and belly and these four scores were added-up into a total FCS. A classical animal model and a direct–indirect effects model were used to estimate genetic parameters for FCS. In addition, a bivariate model with mortality (0 / 1) was used to account for mortality before recording FCS. Due to mortality during the first 23 weeks of laying, 5363 (for W 1) and 5089 (for WB) FCS records were available. Results: Total heritable variance for FCS ranged from 1. 5 % to 9. 8 % and from 9. 8 % to 53. 6 % when estimated respectively with the classical animal and the direct–indirect effects model. The direct–indirect effects model had a significantly higher likelihood. In both lines, 70 % to 94 % of the estimated total heritable variation in FCS was due to indirect effects. Using bivariate analysis of FCS and mortality did not affect estimates of genetic parameters. Genetic correlations were high between adjacent regions for FCS on neck, back, and rump but moderate to low for belly with other regions. Conclusion: Our results show that 70 % to 94 % of the heritable variation in FCS relates to indirect effects, indicating that methods of genetic selection that include indirect genetic effects offer perspectives to improve <b>plumage</b> <b>condition</b> in laying hens. This, in turn could reduce a major welfare problem...|$|E
40|$|Intraspecific {{sexual and}} social {{communications}} {{are among the}} most important factors shaping costly color traits in birds. Condition capture models assume that only animals in superior condition can develop and maintain a colorful plumage. Although there is good evidence that carotenoid-based components of <b>plumage</b> colors show <b>condition</b> dependence, the situation is more controversial with the underlying UV-reflecting structural component. We conducted a brood size manipulation in blue tits (Parus caeruleus) to investigate condition-dependent effects on plumage coloration in male and female offspring. Carotenoid chroma and UV reflectance of the yellow breast plumage showed condition-dependent expression in male and female fledglings. However, only males that were raised in reduced broods had higher UV reflectance in the UV/blue tail feathers, whereas female tail coloration did not differ between treatments. Our data suggest that there is a sex-specific effect on the blue but not the yellow plumage and that this is related to differences in the signaling function of both plumage traits. Although sexual selection may already act on male nestlings to develop colorful tail feathers for the next breeding season, the UV/yellow breast feathers are molted during the postjuvenile molt, and their signaling value is likely to be important for both sexes during the extended postfledgling phase.

40|$|The Northern Mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), {{the state}} bird of Texas, Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Arkansas, is noted for the highly complex and melodious springtime song of males. It {{is ideal for}} {{studying}} mate choice and breeding success because the flamboyant male song is surprising in a socially monogamous bird. I conducted a three year study of mating and breeding success {{to test the hypothesis}} that male song, measured as mean bout length and versatility, could be explained by high rates of extra-pair matings, something which has been found in many other apparently monogamous birds. However, I found that extra-pair fertilization accounted for only 3. 1 % of all young, so my initial hypothesis was disproved. Because song could not be explained by extra-pair fertilization, I investigated the role of this and other variables in mockingbird mate choice and breeding success. The additional variables included: four initial dates in the breeding season, prior-year experience, age, singing frequency, territory quality measured as amounts of shrubbery, three measures of size, three measures of white <b>plumage</b> areas, <b>condition</b> measured as subdermal fat amounts, and blood and gut parasitemia. I looked at the role of these characters in mate choice by comparing mated and unmated males in two years and found that amounts of white plumage, weight, wing lengths, first date sighted on territory, first date heard to sing, blood parasitemia, age, and territory quality were different (P $<$ 0. 10) in one or both years. In 1993, 26. 1 % of mated males were bigamists (1992 : 6. 5 %) who differed from monogamous males in first date heard singing and blood parasitemia. Females prefer older, larger, healthier males with good territories. The following were predictors (P $<$ 0. 10) of breeding success in one or both years, measured as total numbers of broods or offspring, for either or both males and females: song variety, first date sighted on territory, first date heard singing, and first date building the first nest, prior-year breeding experience, prior-year territory occupancy, singing frequency, weight, wing length, fat levels, and territory quality.

On the other hand, birds in furnished cages had lower mortality rates, lower incidence of bone fractures and lower airborne dust concentrations.

40|$|Beak {{trimming}} is used worldwide as {{a method}} of reducing the damage to feathers and skin caused by injurious pecking in laying hens. However, beak trimming also causes some welfare issues as trimming the beak results in pain and sensory loss. Due to this dilemma, there is an ongoing discussion in several European countries about whether to ban beak trimming. In this study, we investigated the welfare consequences of keeping layers with intact beaks and examined for links between injurious pecking damage and keel bone damage on an individual level. A study was conducted on 10 commercial farms housing laying hens in the barn system. Each farm participated with a flock of beak-trimmed hens (T) and a flock of non-trimmed (NT) hens that were visited around 32 and 62 [*]weeks of age. During visits, the condition of plumage, skin, feet, and keel bone of 100 hens was assessed. Mortality was recorded by the producers. NT flocks had a lower prevalence of hens with good <b>plumage</b> <b>condition</b> around 32 [*]weeks of age (94. 1 vs. 99. 6 %, P[*]<[*] 0. 001) and a higher prevalence of hens with poor <b>plumage</b> <b>condition</b> at 62 [*]weeks of age (63. 6 vs. 15. 2 %, P[*]<[*] 0. 001) compared with T flocks. The prevalence of hens with keel bone deviations, with both keel bone fractures and deviations and with body wounds, was higher in NT flocks compared with T flocks at both ages (P[*]<[*] 0. 001). Accumulated mortality from placement to end of production tended to be higher in NT flocks compared with T flocks (14. 2 vs. 8. 6 %; P[*]=[*] 0. 06).

Thus, omitting beak trimming had negative consequences for the condition of plumage, skin, and keel bone, and tended to increase mortality, highlighting the risk of reduced welfare when keeping layers with intact beaks. In addition, injurious pecking damage was found to be positively linked to keel bone damage. The causal relation is unknown, but we propose that fearfulness is an important factor...|$|E

We have studied the factors (i. e. body <b>condition,</b> <b>plumage</b> development, fledging date and sex) influencing the mortality of Cory’s Shearwa- ter Calonectris diomedea fledglings stranded inland due to light pollution in Ten- erife (Canary Islands) during two consecutive breeding seasons (2009 and 2010). Late fledglings showed lower values of a body condition index than early ones. No sex biases were detected, neither considering stranded birds overall, nor for recov- ery dates or in the body condition of rescued fledglings. Our results indicate that late birds stranded by lights showing abundant down are more susceptible to fatal collisions and that the lights do not selectively kill birds with lower body condition indices. An enhancement of veterinary care should be done during the last part of the fledging period when more fatal collisions occur, especially focused on fledg- lings with abundant down. More research to determine why some individuals end up disoriented around artificial lights and others do not is urgently needed to minimize or prevent fallouts. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIncreasing {{experience}} in long-lived species {{is fundamental to}} improving breeding success and ultimately individual fitness. Diving efficiency of marine animals is primarily determined by their physiological and mechanical characteristics. This efficiency may be apparent via examination of biomechanical performance (e. g. stroke frequency and amplitude, change in buoyancy or body angle, etc.), which itself may be modulated according to resource availability, particularly {{as a function of}} depth. We investigated how foraging and diving abilities vary with age in a long-lived seabird. During two breeding seasons, small accelerometers were deployed on young (5 year old) and older (8 / 9 year old) brooding king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) at the Crozet Archipelago, Indian Ocean. We used partial dynamic body acceleration (PDBA) to quantify body movement during dive and estimate diving cost. During the initial part of the descent, older birds exerted more effort for a given speed but younger penguins worked harder in relation to performance at greater depths. Younger birds also worked harder per unit speed for virtually the whole of the ascent. We interpret these differences using a model that takes into account the upthrust and drag to which the birds are subjected during the dive. From this, we suggest that older birds inhale more at the surface but that an increase in the drag coefficient is the factor leading to the increased effort to swim at a given speed by the younger birds at greater depths. We propose that this higher drag {{may be the result of}} young birds adopting less hydrodynamic postures or less direct trajectories when swimming or even having a <b>plumage</b> in poorer <b>condition...</b>|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} phases in the life of petrels (Procellariiformes) is at fledging when young birds pass from parental dependence on land to an independent life at sea. To mitigate mortality at this time, rescue programs are implemented near breeding sites around the world, especially for birds grounded by artificial lights. We evaluated the <b>plumage</b> and body <b>condition</b> of short-tailed shearwater (Ardenna tenuirostris) fledglings captured at colonies just before departure in comparison to fledglings washed up on beaches and to fledglings attracted by artificial light along roads. We measured abundance of down, body mass, and body condition index as the standardized residuals of a regression of body mass on size, and employed linear models to test differences on body mass and body condition between locations. Beach-washed birds were underweight and in poor condition, suggesting their future survival probabilities at sea were low. Birds rescued on roads as a consequence of light attraction had lower body weights and condition indices than fledglings captured at the colony. However, more than 50 % of light-attracted birds had attained similar weights to those of adults, suggesting they have higher probabilities of survival than beach-washed birds. Water-logged birds being washed onto beaches is a natural process, but birds grounded by lighting along roads is an increasing anthropogenic threat that requires management. Thus, management and conservation efforts should be directed to protect birds in the colonies and reduce light-induced mortality, ideally through the strategic reduction of light sources and lateral light spillage. When resources for conservation are limited, rescue programs should focus on rescuing birds from roads rather than beach-washed birds, which have a lower probability of survivalPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|An {{association}} study between SNP {{markers and}} feather condition {{score on the}} back, rump and belly of laying hens was performed. Feather condition score {{is a measure of}} feather damage, which {{has been shown to be}} closely related to feather pecking behaviour in hens housed in groups. A population of 662 hens was genotyped for 1536 SNPs of which 1022 could be used for the association study. The analysis was conducted across 9 different lines of White Leghorn and Rhode Island Red origin. Across lines linkage disequilibrium is conserved at shorter distances than within lines; therefore, SNPs significantly associated with feather condition score across lines are expected to be closer to the functional mutations. The SNPs that had a significant across-line effect but did not show significant SNP-by-line interaction were identified, to test that the association was consistent across lines. Both the direct effect of the individual’s genotype on its <b>plumage</b> <b>condition,</b> and the associative effect of the genotype of the cage mates on the individual’s <b>plumage</b> <b>condition</b> were analysed. The direct genetic effect can be considered as the susceptibility to be pecked at, whereas the associative genetic effect can be interpreted as the propensity to perform feather pecking. Finally, 11 significant associations between SNPs and behavioural traits were detected in the direct model, and 81 in the associative model. A role of the gene for the serotonin receptor 2 C (HTR 2 C) on chromosome 4 was found. This supports existing evidence of a prominent involvement of the serotonergic system in the modulation of this behavioural disorder in laying hens. The genes for IL 9, IL 4, CCL 4 and NFKB were found to be associated to <b>plumage</b> <b>condition,</b> revealing relationships between the immune system and behaviour...|$|E

40|$|With an {{extended}} production cycle up to 100 weeks of age, the yearly number of layer chickens hatched and reared can be reduced, {{and in turn}} so can the euthanasia of day-old male chickens. Lately, the interest for keeping laying hens for a prolonged production cycle has increased in Sweden {{as well as in}} other European countries. However, concerns exist regarding how prolonged laying cycles affect egg quality, animal welfare as well as producer economy. In this trial, the two commercial hybrids LSL Classic and Bovans Robust were housed in furnished cages and a single tier floor production system. In addition to the effects of age, an organic mineral complex with a hypothesized positive effect on egg quality, integument and skeletal condition was evaluated. The study was conducted during 20 - 61 weeks of age. There were no consistent effects of the mineral amino acid complex supplementation on either egg quality, <b>plumage</b> <b>condition</b> or keel bone deformities at a hen age of 55 weeks.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of <b>plumage</b> and integument <b>condition</b> in laying hens provides useful {{information about the}} occurrence of feather pecking and cannibalism. Although feather loss and skin injuries can result from mechanical abrasion or clinical diseases, they are valid animal-based indicators for behavioural disorders. This particularly applies to damage {{on the back and}} tail region of the hens. The aim was to evaluate the behaviour of dual-purpose breeds (Lohmann Dual, LD) and conventional layer hybrids (Lohmann Brown plus, LB+), and to compare a mere visual assessment (Visual Scoring, VSc), with a method involving the handling of individual animals (Hands-on Scoring, HSc). During weekly VSc, the hens’ plumage and integument were scored on five body parts. HSc was carried out on seven study days applying the same scoring scale as for VSc. In LB+ hens, minor plumage damage started at 25 weeks and increased to the 71 st week. With 99. 5 % of LB+ showing feather loss to a different extent, the back was the most severely affected body part. In contrast, only between 4. 5 % and 7 % of LD showed minor feather loss {{at the end of the}} study. Integument damage reached a peak, with 6 % affected LB+ in week 66. Injuries were found only sporadically in LD hens. Spearman’s rho for the comparison of plumages scores given in VSc and HSc was > 0. 90 (p 0. 86, p < 0. 01). Damaging behaviour only occurred in the LB+ flocks, though both of the genetic strains were kept under the same conditions. The visual scoring method was suitable for detecting both plumage and integument damage...|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that strong {{selection}} pressures {{give rise to}} trade-offs between body condition and time in long-distance migrating birds. Birds that are ‘behind schedule’ in fuel deposition or moult should delay departure, and this should result in a negative correlation between initial condition and departure date. We tested this hypothesis in the Great Knot Calidris tenuirostris migrating from north-west Australia to eastern Asia en route to Siberia. Great Knot gain mass and moult into breeding plumage before leaving northern Australia in late March and early April, and fly 5400 – 6000 km to eastern China and Korea. We radiotracked 27 individuals (17 males and ten females) to determine departure dates; 23 migrated and four remained in Australia. We characterized body condition at capture using body mass, predicted pectoral muscle mass (based on ultrasound estimates {{of the size of}} the pectoral muscles) and breeding <b>plumage</b> scores. Residual <b>condition</b> indices were uncorrelated, indicating that at the individual level, variation in one fuelling component was not strongly associated with variation in the other components. Birds that did not depart had lower residual body mass and breeding plumage indices than those that did migrate; these four birds may have been subadults. Neither sex, size nor the condition indices explained variation in departure date of migrants. Reasons for this are explored. Departure dates for northward migrating waders indicate that the migration window (span over which birds depart) decreases with proximity to the northern breeding grounds. We suggest that migration schedules become tighter as birds get nearer to the breeding grounds. Thus the lack of a relationship between condition and departure date in Great Knots may reflect the fact that the departure episode under study is the first one in sequence and is still 4 – 8 weeks before breeding. ...|$|R
40|$|Bird {{displays}} {{vary widely}} in their sensitivity {{to changes in}} signaler <b>condition.</b> <b>Plumage</b> ornaments are generally static and undergo minimal change. Behavioral ornaments, by contrast, are dynamic and may track signaler condition or motivation more closely. The relative importance of each trait type in signaling individual quality has been examined during female choice, but rarely in territorial defense. Male golden whistlers (Pachycephala pectoralis) display both a static plumage signal (throat patch) and a dynamic signal (song) during territorial disputes. We examined sex differences in the responses of territorial pairs to these traits during simulated territory intrusions by decoy males that had either normal or experimentally reduced throat patch sizes, in combination with low or high singing rates. Males paid attention to both categories of signals when estimating rival threat, responding for longer toward males with normal throat patches, and spending more time close to the intruder in high song rate trials. In contrast, females responded differentially only to dynamic signals. Patch size may reflect a male’s long-term viability and status, whereas singing rates may correlate with willingness to escalate contests. As females participate in joint territorial defense and interactions between neighbors are sex specific, the song rates of intruding males may provide clues to their partners’ motivation to escalate contests. By contrast, knowledge of an intruding male’s intrasexual competitive abilities (signaled via patch size) may be unimportant to females. Differences in the signaling properties of static and dynamic signals may maintain the existence of multiple antagonistic signals in this species.

40|$|The {{two main}} goals of my thesis were to further our {{understanding}} of how parental effort is related to life-history trade-offs and to see how parental investment is reflected in various potential measures of nestling quality. I looked at how fitness is maximized by examining (1) the trade-off between current and future reproduction, and (2) the trade-off between quantity and quality of offspring. To see how parents responded to energetic demands and whether each sex reacted in a similar way, I experimentally manipulated brood sizes and quantified provisioning rates. Both male and female parents with enlarged broods increased their feeding rates, but provisioning on a per nestling basis declined, so that parents fledged lighter nestlings with shorter wings. Although the incidence of mortality did not differ between control and enlarged broods, nestlings from enlarged broods were lighter than those from control broods with the same brood size, suggesting that clutch size may be individually optimized. I also looked at how nestlings responded to different levels of nutritional stress in the manipulated broods by quantifying size and body <b>condition,</b> <b>plumage</b> colouration, and the physiological measures of T-cell mediated immune responses, and corticosterone levels in nestling feathers as a long-term integrated measure of stress physiology. The size of melanin ornaments on feathers and the saturation and brightness of carotenoid colouration was associated with nestling mass {{in such a way that}} suggested that plumage characteristics reflect nestling quality. The immune function of nestlings was negatively related to brood size and nestlings in better body condition could mount greater immune responses to foreign antigens suggesting that immune responses are energetically costly. Corticosterone levels in the feathers were not related to nestling body condition and were unaffected by the experimental brood manipulation. The ii mass of male nestlings, which are the larger sex, was more compromised by brood size than female mass was. I also found sex-specific relationships between plumage characteristics and measures of physiological performance. These findings help to explain optimal clutch size and the classic trade-off between quality and quantity of offspring. They also offer new insights into the reliability of putative measures of quality in nestlings and relationships between physiological and morphological traits...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 176 - 192. The thermal {{significance}} of coloration {{was investigated in}} two species of Namib Desert tenebrionid beetles and two species of marine birds. Body temperatures and heat fluxes of a black beetle (Onymacris unguicularis) and a beetle with white elytra (Onymacris bicolor) were compared in a wind tunnel in the laboratory. The effects of visible radiation, infrared radiation, conduction, convection, beetle colour and substratum colour on body temperature were analysed. Results showed that body colour has no overall effect on body temperature. Black elytra are warmed more by visible radiation, but colour is not relevant to heat loss by convection, or to heat flux between a beetle and a heated sand substratum, whether by emitted radiation or reflected visible radiation. 0. bicolor absorbs more heat by conduction and free convection from a heated substratum, but differences in shape between the two species may explain this effect. Combining the various modes of heat exchange to simulate natural conditions reveals that the extra heat absorbed by black elytra is readily dissipated by convection, and owing to the increased heating of white beetles from the substratum, heat fluxes between the two beetles balance. Body temperatures of dead and live beetles of both species were also measured in the field. Experiments were conducted on a hot sand substratum in the beetles' natural environment, under both visible (sunny) and infrared (shaded) conditions. Results supported the laboratory experiments, and showed that when temperature differences do occur {{between black and white}} beetles, these differences are generally less than 3. 5 °C. These differences are small when compared with the ranges of body temperatures experienced by active beetles in the field (± 10 °C). In addition, these temperature differences occur only at low wind speeds (< 2 m s- 1). Activity studies in the field showed that beetles choose to be active in high wind speeds, possibly {{because of the nature of}} their food source, which is wind-blown detritus. It is concluded that coloration does not have adaptive value in terms of the thermal biology of Namib Desert tenebrionid beetles. Physical properties of the plumages of white Cape gannets (Morus capensis) and black Cape cormorants (Phalacrocorax capensis) were measured. Black plumages absorb more visible radiation than white <b>plumages</b> in still <b>conditions.</b> However, laboratory experiments with excised plumages showed that at wind speeds of 2 m s- 1, cormorant plumages and skins were only 2 - 3 °C warmer than those of gannets. These differences disappeared at wind speeds of (< 2 m s- 1). A biophysical heat transfer model predicted that in still, warm, sunny conditions, cormorants may gain up to 185 of their field metabolic rates, whereas gannets would gain only 42. Field observations confirmed that nesting cormorants experience greater heat stress than gannets, even though cormorant nests occur in areas of lower micrometeorological temperatures. Cormorants begin to dissipate heat by evaporative water loss (i. e. pant) at lower environmental temperatures than gannets. The thermal consequence of coloration in these two species are that cormorants may have a lower cost of endothermy at temperatures below the thermoneutral zone, but may experience more heat stress during warm conditions; cormorants select cooler and windier nesting sites than gannets; and increased surf ace temperatures of black cormorant plumages may aid evaporative water loss from wet plumages, facilitating wing-drying. However, ptiloerection and wind may interact in the natural environment, negating the differential heating effects of coloration. It is concluded that the thermal implications of colour are negligible in both species, considering the temperate nature of their environment; Colour in both species is best explained by feeding ecology: white coloration is conspicuous to conspecifics and cryptic to prey in plunge divers (gannets), whereas black colour is cryptic to both conspecifics and prey in solitary swimmers (cormorants) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effects of selection on low mortality in combination with brooding by a mother hen on open-field response at 5 - 6 weeks of age and on plumage and body condition at 42 weeks of age. Birds in the experiment were either selected for low mortality in group housing (low mortality line) or randomly selected (control line) for two generations. These lines originated from the same population. Twenty groups of 10 female birds from each line were used. Within each line, ten groups were brooded by a foster mother and ten groups were non-brooded. At 5 - 6 weeks of age, the chicks were tested in an open-field test for five minutes. At 42 weeks of age, <b>plumage</b> <b>condition</b> and incidence of comb lesions and toe wounds of all birds was recorded.
