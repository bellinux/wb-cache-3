The purpose of the study is to examine the relationships among the levels of practice of co-creating leadership dispositions, the conditions that are associated with the practice of co-creating leadership, and student achievement. The eight dispositions identified by Wasonga and Murphy in 2007 include collaboration, active listening, cultural anthropology, egalitarianism, <b>patience,</b> <b>humility,</b> trust/trustworthiness and resilience. The three conditions identified by Wasonga that predispose co-creating leadership are high levels of participation (deep democracy), quality of relations, and evolving power (empowerment). The study included teachers from six high schools. The high schools were selected by utilizing a stratified sampling method that included: school size, school type, per pupil spending, and accessibility for the researcher. Performance on the 2006 Illinois Prairie State Achievement Examination was used to divide the six schools into two groups of three schools. Based on the Illinois Interactive Report Card (IIRC), one group was designated as the high achieving group and the other was designated as the low achieving group. Teachers in all six schools were asked to complete a 50 -question quantitative survey. The survey asked teachers to consider the existing levels of the co-creating leadership dispositions and conditions as well as the importance of the dispositions and conditions to student achievement. A total of 188 teachers completed the survey. Of the completed surveys, 98 were from the low achieving group and 90 were from the high achieving group. Descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, and bi-variate analysis were utilized to address four research questions and three null hypotheses. Correlational findings included a significant relationship between the 8 CcL leadership dispositions and the 3 CcL conditions. Bi-variate analysis through the utilization of a t-test revealed significant differences between the low performing group (n= 98) and the high performing group (n= 90) to the extent of the CcL leadership dispositions and the extent of the CcL conditions at the p<. 05 level of significance...|$|E

40|$|Includes {{digitized}} {{images in}} JPEG and TIFF formats. Simple curiosity had attracted me to {{a demonstration of}} computer-assisted graphics and I found the idea immensely exciting. As an experienced painter with {{a strong interest in}} color and design, the challenge of programming imagery on my own terms was irresistible. Art, science, technology, formalism, philosophy, subjective thoughts, feelings, the sacred and profane are all incorporated into a loop of ideas, tools and expression. This is not a simple linear process, but a complex one of multiple interacting synaptic connections triggering impulses and responses. These occur within the human brain and with a probable " 100 trillion synapses in every brain" (Rubel, 1979), the uniqueness of each individual becomes apparent. With new tools, a way opens up to new knowledge, new ideas and new opportunities to re-examine the world and re-interpret it in another way. FROM ZERO TO ONE is an art exhibit using the computer as a tool. These drawings/ paintings/graphics are called "plots" in computer terminology and are a culmination of over two years experimentation. The electronic machinery involved is the CDC 3170, a very large computer on the Northridge campus, and the Calcomp plotter 936 which does the actual drawing with ballpoint pens or liquid ink. Limitations of computer time, type of paper and choice of colors are constant realities that effectively teach <b>patience,</b> <b>humility</b> and resourcefulness. Strategies in programming to outwit a time factor and to overcome the difficulties of using only three standardized colors must be devised. Interesting problems in visual perception also occurred. These had evolved out of the peculiarities of the plotter itself which can only draw straight lines. Eventually, I discovered moire patterns as a useful means of expression. Moires are created by overlapping two sets of parallel lines or circles. The kind of design obtained is dependent on the angle of the displacement. Moires are found naturally in the surface reflections in pools of water, in overlapping screens or bamboo blinds, in folds of loosely woven cloth. They are deliberately manufactured into "moire silks" by pressing together slightly misaligned parallel cords of a fabric with a pronounced weave (Oster and Nishijima, 1963). Engineers view moires as interference patterns and use them to analyze strain. Moires are part of every plot in the exhibit. They have been manipulated and bent to conform to the idea of each individual plot contrary to the aim of the engineer. However, inasmuch as a moire is an optical visualization of stress, it enhances the idea of moire as a metaphor. (See more in text...|$|E
40|$|Our {{research}} {{topic is}} {{the influence of}} the didactic communication in the English Teaching Learning Process where our purpose is to analyze {{the influence of the}} Didactic Communication. The didactic communication is the relationship that exists between students and teachers. The didactic communication achieves through of the evident teach neither the constant repetition of a content in a mechanic and monotonous way but through putting into practice strategies to get the best results in the learning of the students, to establish an adequate didactic communication between teachers and students teaching and at the same time, to educate to form knowledge, abilities, values, skills, conviction, To have the capacity of negotiation with the students, the mythologies that need to put into practice, the evaluation, the organization, etc. The teachers can not be like simple technicians that apply standard problems like the best way to guide their practice. The intervention of the teacher has an investigative process taking into account all the movements of the life in the classrooms, applying the educative aims that convey the students into the practice in individual and in group way. The teachers must up date their knowledge and competence and practice them in their professional life. It is necessary to make group activities to get quality in the educative process and adapt them to the particular characteristic of the students. The personality of the teacher is a fundamental factor to develop the Didactic Communication. Each Teacher has different characteristics and unique such as experience, knowledge about the topics, intelligence, style of teaching auto image and others. The teacher with his/her individual characteristic has a behavior of pacification produced by his/her process of toughness observed by the external behavior impacting their students, helping the teacher with his/her educative behavior. The interaction among students and teachers help to reach the aims for the students and the professional development of the teachers. It {{is important to recognize that}} the personality of the teacher is evaluated in the classroom by the students, but in all the social contexts where she/he is moving. On the other hand, the personality includes ways teachers act or behave of dressed, walk, talk, and laugh, etc where the human values like, <b>patience,</b> <b>humility,</b> honesty, solidarity help to the acquisition of the knowledge for the students. Remember the teacher is a model for his/her students. It is necessary that students feel confidence with their teachers and partners where they do not feel nervous to be ridiculizated by the teachers or partners. The teachers need to use different strategies and techniques according to the needs of their students to improve the teaching learning process including a didactic communication to collaborate in the development of the personality of the students giving them opportunities to improve their academical performance and the interest for the English clas...|$|E
