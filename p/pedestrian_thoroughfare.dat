50|$|In 1929 Stein and Wright {{collaborated with}} Kenneth Weinberger {{on the plan}} for the Radburn {{community}} in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, roughly double the area of Sunnyside. The vision for Radburn was of an integrated self-sustaining community, surrounded by greenbelts, specialized automotive thoroughfares (main linking roads, serviced lanes for direct access to buildings, and express highways), and a complete separation of auto and <b>pedestrian</b> traffic. These <b>thoroughfares</b> were called superblocks. This was because the block is very large with a very large road surrounding the houses within. Stein knew that the community could not survive without a road system but he also didn't want the roads dominating the land. Instead, the superblocks make the main focus on the yards and the gardens surrounding the buildings. This grand vision was informed by the lessons of Sunnyside, and by the comparable city-planning work of Ernst May in Germany (researched by a young Catherine Bauer), but the experiment was never completed {{because of the economic}} pressures of the Depression. Due to the Depression and different land issues, Radburn was not able to become a Garden City, but it was still impressionable because the superblock was a very successful idea that has been repeated numerous times.|$|R

40|$|Coastal {{areas are}} {{home to more than}} half of the world's {{population}} and many of its most populated urban areas. Coastal urbanism remains very much in demand despite major risk factors such as sea level rise, longterm shoreline erosion, storm surges, land liquefaction, and subsidence. City-building on reclaimed land is an ambitious form of development yet prevalent around the world, especially where an economic growth agenda is pursued aggressively against the availability of land resources. This thesis develops a critical design agenda to respond to how pro-growth forces and environmental change can be negotiated towards a reconsidered coastal urbanism. The thesis argument is that coastal urban and territorial form should not follow a static master plan based on a risk model; instead, it should employ/follow a dynamic gradient of permanence and ephemerality in multiple time scales, following coastal succession as a design analogy. Tokyo Bay is the site of experimentation. The world's largest metropolitan area has a long history of land reclamation debates and projects, which resulted in a highly articulated urban coast with reclaimed shorelines, and near- and off-shore artificial islands with a mix of uses. The on-going construction of the urban archipelago is an outcome of urban and regional metabolisms, where incinerated solid waste, dredged sediment, excavated soil, and demolished buildings are deposited to make new land. Demand for post-industrial urban development and land reclamation is still alive in coastal Tokyo despite the vulnerabilities of flooding and seismic events. Large waterfront sites are now available for new development. The construction of permanent and temporary facilities in Tokyo Bay for the 2020 Summer Olympics offers an opportunity to develop a succession- based design strategy-not only for the 2020 peak condition, but also in anticipation of future transformations. The design exploration establishes, via strategic cartography, a resiliency district framework based on a gradient of permanence and flexibility in the ground condition. The sharply delineated boundary between land and sea is rethought as a dynamic frontier zone of flexibility that adapts to flooding and sea level rise and as an active site for coastal deposition and submersion. A second, elevated ground level is proposed to serve as a <b>pedestrian</b> and emergency <b>thoroughfare,</b> as well as an extension of transportation and logistics infrastructure. The Metabolist imaginary envisioned Tokyo Bay as a site of continuous urban growth towards a mega-scale climax state; ground was taken for granted and the possibilities of urban decline or reconstruction were hardly considered within the same design utopia. This project argues for a New Metabolism in which the ground is conceived as an indeterminate landscape of change. The uncertainties of the ground are addressed by an 'artificial land' infrastructure which organizes and facilitates transformation over time. by Caner Oktem. Thesis: S.
