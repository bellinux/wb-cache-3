They were authorized, in the most ample and undefined manner, to form a commercial treaty with America on the spot. This was no trivial object. As the formation of such a treaty would necessarily have been no less than the breaking up of our whole commercial system, and the giving it an entire new form, one would imagine that the Board of Trade would have sat day and night to model propositions, which, on our side, might serve as a basis to that treaty. No such thing. Their learned leisure was not in the least interrupted, though {{one of the members of}} the Board was a commissioner, and might, in mere compliment to his office, have been supposed to make a show of deliberation on the subject. But he knew that his colleagues would have thought he laughed in their faces, had he attempted to bring anything the most distantly relating to commerce or colonies before them. A noble person, engaged in the same commission, and sent to learn his commercial rudiments in New York, (then under the operation of an act for the universal <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade,)</b> was soon after put at the head of that board. This contempt from the present ministers of all the pretended functions of that board, and their manner of breathing into its very soul, of inspiring it with its animating and presiding principle, puts an end to all dispute concerning their opinion of the clay it was made of. But I will give them heaped measure.|$|E

5000|$|Qing {{officials}} {{knew that}} allowing Sino-British commerce in Zhejiang would undoubtedly bring increased prosperity to the province and spur its development. However, given {{the length of}} time that foreign trade had been focused on Canton, a powerful interest group comprising the local Chinese merchants, customs officials and Qing scholar-bureaucrats had developed there. This faction enjoyed a monopoly on trade and its associated corruption and extortion from which it extracted the maximum benefit. They were naturally unwilling to allow any part of their interests in Canton to be transferred to the north. Meanwhile, Zhejiang possessed a number of potential foreign trade ports but opening them up would have the unsettling side effect of creating additional responsibility for local officials. As a result, Yang Yingju (:zh: 杨应琚), Governor-general of Min-Zhe and responsible for Zhejiang, lobbied officials in Beijing for a <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> in Ningbo.In 1757, the Qianlong Emperor responded to pressure from his officials and implemented a new foreign trade policy whereby all ships from overseas were barred from every Chinese port with the exception of Canton. Known in Chinese as Yī kŏu tōngshāng (一口通商 [...] "Single port commerce system"), the Canton System arose in part as a result of Flint's actions.|$|E
5000|$|When in 1627 the British {{began to}} claim the island St. Vincent, they opposed the French {{settlements}} (which had started around 1610 by cultivating plots) and its partnerships with the Caribs. Over time, the Black Caribs were getting power and social prestige on the other native peoples and they were considered by the British, who wanted to occupy the island {{and give it to}} the British Crown, as a threat that had to be eradicated. The governor of the island, William Young, complained that the Black Caribs had the best land and they had no right to live there. Moreover, the friendship of the French settlers with the Black Caribs, drove them, even though they had also tried to stay with San Vicente, tried to support them in their struggle. All this caused the [...] "War Caribbean".The First Carib War began in 1769. Led primarily by Black Carib chieftain Joseph Chatoyer, the Caribs successfully defended the windward side of the island against a military survey expedition in 1769, and rebuffed repeated demands that they sell their land to representatives of the British colonial government. The effective defense of the Caribs, the British ignorance of the region and London opposition to the war made this be halted. With military matters at a stalemate, a peace agreement was signed in 1773 that delineated boundaries between British and Carib areas of the island. [...] The treaty delimited the area inhabited by the Caribs, and demanded repayment of the English and French plantations of runaway slaves who took refuge in St. Vincent. This last clause, and the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> with neighbouring islands, so little endeared the Caribs. Three years later, the French supported American independence (1776-1783); the Caribs aligned against the British. Apparently, in 1779 the Caribs inspired such terror to the British colonists that surrender to the French was preferred than firing a gun.|$|E
40|$|Tablets of {{cuneiform}} writing remaining {{from the}} period named as “Assyrian Trade Colonies Age” of the second millenium B. C. to the present-day are the oldest written sources which enlighten the Anatolian history. Almost all the tablets are about the doings of Assyrian merchants who came to Anatolia on business purposes. For that reason all the information we obtain about the said period of Anatolia deals with the economic life. According to the information given by those cuneiform tablets which are written in the old Assyrian dialect and about 25 thousand in number for today, the trade activities were being carried out in exchange of taxes levied by the Anatolian city chieftains and on condition that the merchants should obey some other regolations.

40|$|We {{present a}} theory of a partial {{economic}} reform of a planned economy, {{similar to the one}} that took place in Russia since 1988 and in China earlier. In such a reform, some markets are liberalized in the sense that producers can sell output to whomever they want, including private firms, at free prices, {{but at the same time}} must sell to state firms at state prices. We show that such a reform can result in a substantial diversion of subsidized inputs away from state firms and toward private firms even when state firms value these inputs more. The result may be a reduction of total output. The simple analysis sheds light on many consequences of the Soviet reform, such as breakdown of coordination of production, increased state policing <b>of</b> delivery quotas, <b>prohibitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> cooperatives, and opposition to privatiza-tion. The model also explains why partial reform failed in Russia but worked in China...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the effects on prices and {{landings}} of two successive 1 / 322 ̆ 2 annual increases in the minimum size at first capture governing the U. S. American lobster (Homarus americanus) fishery. Study methods included primary data collection, structural econometric modeling and time series analysis, lobster population-dynamics simulation modeling, a lobster pricing experiment, and Theil and Goldberger 2 ̆ 7 s mixed-estimation procedure. It was estimated that the first increase in minimum size at first capture reduced the wholesale value of 1988 U. S. landings by about 2. 7 million (1989 dollars) initially, and that the combined effects of both size increases reduced the wholesale value of 1989 landings by about 5. 6 million (1989 dollars). Estimates of U. S. live-lobster industry structure, trade, and regional distribution were provided, and the fundamental characteristics of the U. S. lobster market reviewed. Recent industry developments, including the 1987 - 1993 Gulf of St. Lawrence minimum-size increase program, fresh-frozen American lobster tails, the 1990 U. S. <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> with small live lobsters, and the 1991 federal definition of overfishing, were discussed.

30|$|The use of seed-attacking {{insects and}} fungi for {{biological}} {{control is a}} key component of integrated control strategies against Australian acacias, especially in South Africa (Richardson and Kluge 2008; Impson et al. 2009). These efforts have, over several decades, significantly reduced seed production of several invasive acacias, have reduced the density of some invasive populations, and seem to be reducing the spread rates, thereby contributing to overall control aims. Many other types of control are also being used to deal with current and potential future problems with invasive Australian acacias. These include: risk assessment (to help identify highly invasive species that are not yet in the country); eradication (to totally remove populations of those species that still occur over small areas and at low densities, e.g. Kaplan et al. 2012, 2014); containment using mechanical and chemical control; exploitative harvesting of invasive populations (e.g. for fire wood); research to develop of sterile cultivars of commercially important species (Wilson et al. 2011; Harbard et al. 2012;); spatial prioritization of control operations (Roura-Pascual et al. 2009); education and raising awareness; the use of legislation to assign responsibility of control and legislation to prohibit cultivation (Aguiar et al. 2014), <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> of some species in certain areas (van Wilgen et al. 2011). All of these components of management could reduce problems associated with invasiveness of A. mangium and should be considered when assessing risks associated with plantings and in compiling management plans for reducing problems that already exist.|$|E

40|$|The {{forbidden}} bay‘u al-gh arar {{can best}} be translated as “trading in risk”. In the face <b>of</b> risk, any <b>trade</b> would involve some degree <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> in risk, and thus jurists disagree over whether a specific contract is forbidden or not based on their varying assessments of whether the amount of risk is substantial or small. Moreover, the prohibition is often overruled in cases where clear economic benefit can only be served by a contract which includes substantial trading in risk. We show that “trading in risk ” is generally inefficient relative {{to other forms of}} risk sharing. Hence if a contract can attain its economic aim of increasing economic efficiency through either form of risk transfer, the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> in risk should be applicable. Cases where such a prohibition is moot because the risk trading instrument is not used do not affect this general conclusion. In cases where trading in risk is integral to the contract, but where the contract is important to meet economic needs (e. g. salam and ’istis. nā‘), the analysis is still useful in two regards: (i) we can consider {{whether or not there is}} a risk sharing mechanism which can reduce part <b>of</b> the inherent <b>trading</b> in risk (e. g. financial vs. mutual insurance), and (ii) we should consider such alternatives if secondary tools for managing the resulting risk are sought...|$|R
