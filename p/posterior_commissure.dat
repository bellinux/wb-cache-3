The pedal ganglia are placed beneath the radula sac and joined together by an anterior and a <b>posterior</b> <b>commissure.</b> The abdominal ganglion lies {{a little to the}} right of the median line.

25|$|As {{part of the}} {{embryonic}} {{cerebrospinal fluid}} (eCSF), SCO-spondin is of the uttermost importance {{in the development of}} the neuronal system, being a key protein in the balancing of differentiation and proliferation of the neuroepithelium. It starts being secreted by the diencephalic floor plate in the first embryonic stages playing an important part in the development and differentiation of structures such as the pineal gland. In particular, the SCO-spondin appears to have a major role on the growth of the <b>posterior</b> <b>commissure</b> (PC), which was proved when mutants lacking SCO, and hence had no SCO-spondin, where unable to form a functional PC. On early stages of development the axonal growth is stimulated, being inhibited afterwards. A steep gradient of spondin expression in the neuroepithelium signals the need for different processes to take place, favoring the fasciculation on the cephalic region and the incorporation of new neurons on the caudal region. As such, the lower concentrations of SCO-spondin in the caudal region favor the axonal outgrowth and incorporation of new axons on the <b>posterior</b> <b>commissure</b> and the higher concentrations in the cephalic region promotes the interactions between the neighboring axons. In conjugation with the secretion of SCO-spondin, the midline positioning of the SCO assumes a great importance on the axon guidance process. This positioning facilitates the signaling of the turning points for the axons, through the spreading of spondin.|$|E
25|$|On {{the lower}} {{abdominal}} skin, a slight skin slit {{was made to}} allow the future urethra to be passed through upon inversion of the neovaginal lining. A Foley catheter was inserted and the urethra was sutured onto the catheter, about 5cm distally from its passage through the skin. No skin suture {{was used in the}} urethral meatus, and some kind of scar contraction was always foreseen. Two sutures were bilaterally passed through the perianal skin and the levator ani muscles and served to tightly and firmly support an obstetric stent, placed in the neovagina to provide support for the inverted skin flap. A drain was left in the <b>posterior</b> <b>commissure</b> and, finally, excess scrotal skin was resected to obtain a good appearance of the major labia.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn Drosophila, the ventral {{nerve cord}} (VNC) {{architecture}} is built from neuroblasts that are specified during embryonic development, mainly by transcription factors. Here {{we show that}} Engrailed, a homeodomain transcription factor known {{to be involved in}} the establishment of neuroblast identity, is also directly implicated in the regulation of axonal guidance cues. <b>Posterior</b> <b>commissures</b> (PC) are missing in engrailed mutant embryos, and axonal pathfinding defects are observed when Engrailed is ectopically expressed at early stages, prior to neuronal specification. We also show that frazzled, enabled, and trio, all of which are potential direct targets of Engrailed and are involved in axonal navigation, interact genetically with engrailed to form <b>posterior</b> <b>commissures</b> in the developing VNC. The regulation of frazzled expression in engrailed-expressing neuroblasts contributes significantly to the formation of the <b>posterior</b> <b>commissures</b> by acting on axon growth. Finally, we identified a small genomic fragment within intron 1 of frazzled that can mediate activation by Engrailed in vivo when fused to a GFP reporter. These results indicate that Engrailed's function during the segregation of the neuroblasts is crucial for regulating different actors that are later involved in axon guidance...|$|R

25|$|Despite being a much conserved {{structure}} throughout evolution, {{there are}} some differences on the SCO from different mammals. It is the first secretory structure to differentiate and remains fully developed and functional during the life of almost every vertebrate, excluding bats, anthropoid apes and humans. More specifically, in humans, the SCO development has a regressive nature. It reaches its apex development in fetus from 3 to 5 month old, functioning as a fully active secretory structure of the brain during this time span, and extending from the pineal recess over the <b>posterior</b> <b>commissure</b> to the mesocoelic recess. It is composed by a characteristic high columnar epithelium, which is {{not found in the}} adult SCO. Following this maxed developed state, the SCO starts regressing and in children from 3 to 4 years old it already has a vestigial character, being reduced to islet like structures on the adult. Although the remaining cells can possess some secretory material the SCO is truly vestigial in both structure and secretory function, in adults.|$|E

50|$|Using the Horsley-Clarke {{apparatus}} {{for human}} brains was {{difficult because of}} the inability to visualize intracranial anatomic detail via radiography.

The first stereotactic device for the human brain was conceptualized by Aubrey T. Mussen in 1918 but received little attention and a first stereotactic surgery was only performed 30 years later. Most first stereotactic devices applied in humans used the pineal gland and the foramen of Monro as landmarks.

40|$|A {{technique}} is described for estimating {{the position of}} the intercommisural line (AC-PC line) directly from landmarks on positron emission tomographic (PET) images, namely the ventral aspects of the anterior and posterior corpus callosum, the thalamus, and occipital pole.

Using regression analysis, the ease and reliability of fitting to these points was found to be high. This directly derived AC-PC line estimate was validated in terms of the assumptions used in the method of Fox et al. The ratio of distance between the AC-PC line and a line passing through the base of the inion (GI line) to total brain height was 0. 21, as predicted. The technique has been further validated by localizing focal activation of the sensorimotor cortex.

Indeed, we show that these two proteins are acting together in axon growth and midline crossing, and that this concerted action occurs at early development, in neuroblasts. More precisely, we identified that their expressions in NB 6 - 4 are necessary and sufficient to trigger the formation of the PCs, demonstrating that segmentation genes such as EN and GsbN {{play a crucial role in}} the determination of NB 6 - 4 in a way that will later influence growth and guidance of all the axons that form the PCs.

Easier tumor extension may be due to absence of the internal perichondrium and ossification of thyroid cartilage. Microvascularization of the anterior commissure is significant for tumor spread in glottis and paraglottic space.
