It is a semi-hard cheese, {{with small}} {{granular}} holes, and {{is made from}} whole milk, which gives it a 26 percent fat content. There is also a version with less fat labeled [...] "17% fetthalt". Hushållsost is produced in cylinders weighing 1 to 2 kg each, which are today wrapped in plastic film before being aged around 60 days on average. The taste is described as mild yet somewhat sour. The cheese was traditionally produced on farms; the name hushållsost is found in print at least as early as 1898. It {{is closely related to}} <b>Port-Salut</b> <b>cheese.</b>|$|E
