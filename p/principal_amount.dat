However, the interest portion of the loan repayments, which are essentially additional contributions to the 401(k), are made with after-tax funds but they do not increase the after-tax basis in the 401(k).

A number of countries have established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments. Limited research on the usefulness and quality of derivative related disclosures are mostly based on the US. This paper examines the usefulness of derivative related disclosure in the Australian banking sector. We first review the policy and requirements for derivative related disclosures in the Australian banking sector. Then we investigate the usefulness of derivative related disclosures based on a sample from major Australian banks. Our preliminary empirical results reveal that the disclosure of <b>principal</b> <b>amounts</b> and credit disclosure appear to be insignificant to stock returns.

These examples along with the example of an innovative index-based livestock insurance pilot project in Mongolia illustrate how layers, or tranches, of natural disaster risk can be financed during the product development phase by creating structures similar to the Special Purpose Vehicles used in catastrophe bond, mortgage bond, and the emerging microfinance bond markets.

40|$|Financial and {{insurance}} theories explain that large widely-held corporations manage corporate risks if {{doing so is}} costective to reduce frictional costs such as taxes, agency costs and financial distress costs. A large number of previous empirical studies, most in the U. S., have tested the hypotheses underlying corporate risk management with financial derivative instruments. In order to quantify corporate hedge demand, most previous studies have used the ratio of <b>principal</b> notional <b>amount</b> of derivatives to company size, although they recognize that company size is not an appropriate proxy for financial risk. This paper analyzes the interest-rate-risk hedge demand by Australian companies, measured through the ratio of <b>principal</b> notional <b>amount</b> of interest rate derivatives to interest-rate-riskbearing liabilities. Modern panel data methods are used, with two panel data sets from 1998 to 2003 (1102 and 465 observations, respectively). Detailed information about interest-rate-risk exposures was available after manual data collection from financial annual reports, which was only possible due to specific reporting requirements in Australian accounting standards. Regarding {{the analysis of the}} extent of hedge, our measurement of interest-rate-risk exposures generates some significant results di erent from those found in previous studies. For example, this study shows that total leverage (total debt ratio) is not significantly important to interest-rate-risk hedge demand and that, instead, this demand is related to the specific risk exposure in the interest bearing part of the firms liabilities. This study finds significant relations of interest-rate-risk hedge to company size, floating-interest-rate debt ratio, annual log returns, and company industry type (utilities and non-banking financial institutions) ...|$|R
