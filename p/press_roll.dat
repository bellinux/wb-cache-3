5000|$|Dodds {{continues}} to be admired for the creativity of his playing. He believed in playing something different for every chorus of every tune. Most of his contemporaries played a short buzz or <b>press</b> <b>roll</b> on the back beats (the 2nd and 4th beats), but Dodds played a long roll that lasted till the following beat, which created a smoother time feel that he later developed into the jazz ride pattern most commonly used ever since. Dodds was most well known, however, {{for what he called}} his [...] "shimmy beat", which he first used in 1918 at Jack Sheehan's in New Orleans. He described it in his autobiography: [...] "One night a French soldier came in. When he heard the music he couldn't dance to it, but he just started to shake all over. That's the way it affected me. I saw him do it and I did it, too". Dodds' unique shimmy beat caught Louis Armstrong's eye as well, who said: [...] "To watch him play, especially when he beat on the rim of his bass in a hot chorus, he sort of shimmied when he beat with his sticks. Oh! Boy that alone was in my estimation the whole worth of admission". Besides his unique drumming style, something important to Dodds was paying attention to the musicians in the outfit and fitting his drumming into the style the band was playing. He tried {{to get to know each}} member in the outfit and learn about how each person played his or her instrument. Throughout his autobiography, Dodds talks about listening to the different band members and using his role as drummer to help the band come together: [...] "It was my job to study each musician and give a different background for each instrument. When a man is playing it's up to the drummer to give him something to make him feel the music and make him work. That's the drummer's job".|$|E

40|$|Results of {{this study}} {{indicate}} that under the conditions where the two boundaries are maintained at the same temperature, the viscous heat dissipation within the lubricant, due to viscous drag and inertial effects, plays a major role in the net heat transfer. However, when the inner surface temperature is much greater than that of the shoe, the effect of viscous heat dissipation is reduced significantly. For the conditions analyzed in this study, the regions under the solid part of the shoe, which are associated with a greater lubricant velocity, had a significant influence on the magnitude of the heat transfer from the oil to the roll; because of a greater lubricant thickness for the left-hand sub-channel, the dissipated heat, and net heat transfer under the solid part in the left-hand sub-channel was greater than that for the corresponding region in the right-hand sub-channel.

Impulse drying is an efficient method of drying paper but the process suffers from a significant weakness, known as delamination; this occurs when the paper is literally blown apart by pressure built up within the pores of the paper during the drying process. Efforts have been made to prevent this phenomenon from occurring by modifying the physical characteristics of the paper sheet and of the <b>press</b> <b>roll.</b> However, only a small amount of work has been done to understand the cause of delamination: the flash evaporation of water within the paper pores. This dissertation develops a model of what occurs inside a paper sheet (during one stage of the impulse drying process) using established physical laws and thermodynamic properties in order to better understand the flash evaporation process. The model consists of a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations. We prove that the initial value problem posed by this system has a unique solution and that this solution depends continuously on its parameters. We also conduct a linearized stability analysis of the nonlinear system. Finally, we solve the nonlinear system numerically, analyze the solution, and then conduct a parametric study, first, to ensure that the predictions of the model agree with what has been seen in experiments and, second, to better understand how the physical parameters involved in the model affect the solution of the initial value problem...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{energy savings}} can be {{achieved}} by improving efficiency of water removal in the press section of a paper machine, rather than energy-intensive evaporative dryer cans. Impulse drying is a novel technology to remove water from the sheet in the press section by using a heated <b>press</b> <b>roll.</b> 	Delamination is a major challenge to be overcome before impulse drying can be implemented successfully. Delamination is caused by a region of high temperature liquid water under high pressure in the press. Upon exiting the nip, the pressure drops and the high temperature water flashes to steam. If the expansion of the steam is too strong, the bonds between the fibers will fail and a blister will form. The formation of this blister is characteristic of delamination. 	The goal of this project was to understand the internal mechanics of a wet web as it exits the nip of an impulse dryer. In this way, the components of the sheet can be tailored to open the operating window of impulse drying. A mathematical model, developed to describe the deflection and delamination of an elastic membrane, was utilized in this work. Three failure criteria were employed to represent delamination of this pliable membrane from the more rigid sub layers in the sheet. 	The experimental portion of this effort was devoted to showing the validity of these models and which was the best fit. A series of experiments were employed to validate the model. A peel test was used to determine the amount of work needed to pull a membrane from a rigid substrate. Pressurized blister experiments were conducted to find the relationship between critical pressure and initial defect size. The predictions from the mathematical model were then compared to these experimental values. Finally, work was done to understand the physics of the delamination of a porous membrane. M. S.
