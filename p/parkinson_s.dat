40|$|Background: The {{transcription}} factor Nrf 2, encoded by the NFE 2 L 2 gene, {{is an important}} regulator of the cellular protection against oxidative stress. <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease is a neurodegenerative disease highly associated with oxidative stress. In a previously published study, we reported associations of NFE 2 L 2 haplotypes with risk and age at onset of idiopathic <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease in a Swedish discovery material and a Polish replication material. Here, we have extended the replication study and performed meta-analyses including the Polish material and four new independent European patient-control materials. Furthermore, all SNPs included in the haplotype windows were investigated individually for associations with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease in meta-analyses including all six materials. Methods: Totally 1038 patients and 1600 control subjects were studied. Based on previous NFE 2 L 2 haplotype associations with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease, five NFE 2 L 2 tag SNPs were genotyped by allelic discrimination and three functional NFE 2 L 2 promoter SNPs were genotyped by sequencing. The impact of individual SNPs and haplotypes on risk and age at onset of <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease were investigated in each material individually and in meta-analyses of the obtained results. Results: Meta-analyses of NFE 2 L 2 haplotypes showed association of haplotype GAGCAAAA, including the fully functional promoter haplotype AGC, with decreased risk (OR = 0. 8 per allele, p = 0. 012) and delayed onset (+ 1. 1 years per allele, p = 0. 048) of <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease. These results support the previously observed protective effect of this haplotype in the first study. Further, meta-analyses of the SNPs included in the haplotypes revealed four NFE 2 L 2 SNPs associated with age at onset of <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease (rs 7557529 G > A, - 1. 0 years per allele, p = 0. 042; rs 35652124 A > G, - 1. 1 years per allele, p = 0. 045; rs 2886161 A > G, - 1. 2 years per allele, p = 0. 021; rs 1806649 G > A, + 1. 2 years per allele, p = 0. 029). One of these (rs 35652124) is a functional SNP located in the NFE 2 L 2 promoter. No individual SNP was associated with risk of <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease. Conclusion: Our results {{support the hypothesis that}} variation in the NFE 2 L 2 gene, encoding a central protein in the cellular protection against oxidative stress, may contribute to the pathogenesis of <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease. Functional studies are now needed to explore these results further...|$|E

In the pilot study we translated the Questionnaire for Impulse-Compulsive Disorders in <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> Disease (QUIP) and the Barrat Impulsiveness Scale (BIS- 11) to Norwegian and administered them to a convenience sample of PD patients. Statistical analyses was undertaken with SPSS version 15. 0. The analyses showed comparable numbers of ICDs in our sample of patients compared with previous findings and we found a significant correlation between the presence of an ICD and the degree of impulsivity. This study emphasizes the need for an increased awareness about ICDs and other compulsive disorders in <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease as a possible side effect of their medication. The sensitive nature of these disorders requires a systematic and cautious approach, although an appreciation of their presence in a process of normalization seems equally important. Even though the pilot study was done on a small population after convenience sample our findings support previous studies that encourage clinicians to do routine testing for ICDs and other compulsive behaviours in PD patients...|$|E

Patient N., 75 years old, suffering for 15 years from <b>Parkinson,</b> <b>s</b> disease, akinetic­rigid form of the disease, stage 4 by Hyun–Yar. Since 2009, he received levodopa/carbidopa 250 / 25 mg 5 times/day (daily dose of 1250 mg of levodopa); pramipexole 3. 5 mg per day (daily dose 3. 5 mg), amantadine sulfate 100 mg 5 times/day (daily dose 500 mg). While taking antiparkinsonian drugs the patient developed behavioral disorders such as dopamine disregulatory syndrome combined with punding, hypersexuality and compulsive shopping accompanied by visual hallucinations. The total equivalent dose of levodopa was 1600 mg per day. The second clinical case. Patient R., 52 years old, suffers from <b>Parkinson,</b> <b>s</b> disease about 5 years, a mixed form. She complained of slowness of movement, tremor in her left hand, sleep disturbances, poor mood. The clinic was appointed piribedil 50 mg 3 times per day. Despite {{the fact that the}} patient took only one of dopaminergic drugs in a therapeutic daily dose, she developed impulsive­compulsive disorder as hyper­ sexuality, compulsive shopping and binge eating.   Results. In the first clinical case for correction of behavioral disorders in patients with <b>Parkinson,</b> <b>s</b> disease levodopa/carbidopa dose was reduced to 750 mg per day (3 / 4 Tab. 4 times a day); added to levodopa/benserazide dispersible 100 mg morning and levodopa/benserazide 100 mg before sleep (total dose of levodopa of 950 mg per day). Amantadine sulfate and pramipexole were canceled. It was added to the therapy of atypical neuroleptic clozapine dose 6, 25 mg overnight. After 3 months marked improvement, regressed visual hallucina­ tions, improved family relationships, background mood became more stable. The patient continue to sing karaoke, but this hobby has be­ come less intrusive.   In the second clinical event correction impulsive­compulsive disorders piribedil was replaced with pramipexole 1. 5 mg prolonged form one time a day.

DEPARTMENT: Special education department SUPERVISOR: Ji ina Klenková, Doc. PaedDr., PhD. ABSTRACT: The doctoral thesis deals with diagnosing communication disability for people with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease (PD). PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with high occurrence of hypokinetic dysarthria (HD). The theoretical part of the thesis characterizes <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease, weak and strong points of logopaedic diagnostics and describes HD. The empirical part of the thesis is based on quantitative research. The aims of our study were to modify test Dysarthric profile 3 F {{to be more sensitive}} to mild stage of HD, to detect HD symptoms in early untreated PD patiens, to notice HD progression in retest, to objectify results of clinical evaluation by acoustic measurments and to detect subjective perception of patient s own speech. We studied people with PD and neurologically healthy control speakers. We evaluated HD in 50 % PD subjects in early untreated stage of PD and in 74 % PD speakers in retest. We observe that between the most sensitive diagnostical tasks in clinical evaluation with high correlation with acoustic analysis belong evaluation of hoarse voice in sustained phonation of vowels and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Mesencephalic {{dopamine}} (mesDA) neurons degenerate {{in patients}} with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease. In order to develop new treatment strategies for rescuing or replacing degenerating mesDA neurons, an improved understanding of the development and survival of these neurons in the normal brain is required. In paper I we identify two key players, Lmx 1 a and Msx 1, implicated in the specification of mesDA neurons. Lmx 1 a and Msx 1 are important for ensuring the correct mesDA neuron differentiation cascade by suppressing alternative cell fates, promoting neurogenesis and inducing the generation of mesDA neurons. In papers I and II we provide evidence that over-expression of Lmx 1 a both in mouse and human embryonic stem cells leads to an efficient generation of authentic mesDA neurons. These in vitro engineered mesDA neurons might, in the future, {{be used as a}} cell source in cell replacement therapy for patients with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease. However, to ensure a safe treatment, the use of embryonic stem cells depends on avoiding adverse effects such as uncontrolled cell growth. In papers II and III we show that an enrichment for embryonic stem cellderived progenitor cells or mature neurons, prior to grafting, removes unwanted dividing cells. Moreover, a higher number of mesDA neurons are present in the grafts after transplantation of sorted neurons, compared to progenitor cells. In paper IV, we show that ligands for the retinoic X receptor are present in the mesDA neuron domain in vivo, and that they mediate neuronal survival in primary mesDA neurons expressing both Nurr 1 and the retinoic X receptor. These factors might be of interest as a potential treatment strategy to enhance survival of endogenous or transplanted mesDA neurons for patients with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease. The work presented in this thesis has increased the knowledge concerning the development of mesDA neurons and has helped to establish a protocol enabling the production of highly purified mesDA neurons. This knowledge can facilitate the establishment of new therapies for patients with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease, be a useful tool in drug screenings and help to identify additional factors important for the development, survival and maintenance of the mesDA system...|$|E

40|$|<b>Parkinson</b> 4 <b>s</b> disease (PD) is {{a common}} {{neurodegenerative}} disorder of unknown cause. The key feature of PD is the preferential loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta.

Although PD is traditionally thought of as a disease of neurons several observations indicate that astrocytes are active contributors to the initiation or progression of PD. To elucidate the PD pathogenesis different mouse lines carrying PD-inducing gene mutations have been generated. One line carries a homozygous deletion of parkin Exon 3 and two transgenic lines overexpress human doubly mutated 3 ̆b 1 -synuclein (A 30 P, A 53 T).

40|$|Dopamine is {{fundamental}} in human behavior for movement, cognition and reward. A dysfunctional dopamine system is implicated in several neurological and psychiatric {{disorders such as}} <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease and schizophrenia. Dopamine mediates its effects through five receptors. Dopamine D 2 receptors are well studied and successful drug targets {{in the treatment of}} <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease and schizophrenia. The functional role of dopamine D 1 receptors is not fully understood and the clinical potential remains elusive. In the present thesis, full dopamine D 1 receptor agonists were used to characterize the functional roles of these dopamine receptor subtypes. A number of aspects of psychomotor activation relevant for <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease and schizophrenia were examined with the full dopamine D 1 receptor agonists dihydrexidine and A 68930. Stimulation of dopamine D 1 receptors by dihydrexidine and A 68930 resulted in inhibition of locomotor activity in rats exploring an open-field. In habituated animals, with a low baseline activity, as well as in dopamine depleted rats, no locomotor activation was evident following dopamine D 1 receptor stimulation. The results suggest inhibitory actions of dopamine D 1 receptors in psychomotor activation. In fact, dihydrexidine and A 68930 blocked amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, a traditional sign of antipsychotic action. A possible site of action for the effects of dihydrexidine and A 68930 is stimulation of prefrontal dopamine D 1 receptors, as indexed by neuronal activation (c-fos). A different approach to examine dopamine D 1 receptor agonism was used with clozapine that previously has been shown to possess dopamine D 1 receptor agonist properties in vivo. Clozapine does not cause extrapyramidal side effects and can be used in drug-induced psychosis in <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease. Two new atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine and quetiapine, that both have a similar pharamacological profile to clozapine, were compared with clozapine on drug-induced catalepsy. In contrast to olanzapine and quetiapine, clozapine blocked catalepsy. It is concluded that the pharmacological profile of clozapine differs from olanzapine and quetiapine, a finding that possibly can be explained by dopamine D 1 receptor agonism as a feature of clozapine. Whether the inhibition of psychomotor activity by dihydrexidine and A 68930 reside in specific D 1 or D 5 receptor stimulation is not known. In an attempt to functionally separate dopamine D 1 and D 5 receptor function, siRNA for induction of RNA interference (RNAi) was used to specifically knock-down D 1 receptors. Despite high efficacy in an in vitro system, no receptor knockdown was obtained in rodent brain with siRNA. The results suggest that a refinement of the RNAi technology is needed before functional studies in vivo is possible. The present thesis suggests important functional roles of brain dopamine D 1 receptors that may have relevance for schizophrenia and <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease. A particularly interesting finding is an inhibitory role of prefrontal dopamine D 1 receptors on psychomotor activation, a finding that may have clinical implications in the treatment of schizophrenia...|$|E
40|$|New {{criteria}} for <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease-associated psychosis (PDAP) were recently proposed by a NINDS-NIMH working group. We’ assessed 116 consecutive unselected outpatients with PD {{for the existence}} of psychotic symptoms during the previous month, using a structured questionnaire covering the whole spectrum of PDAP symptoms. Hallucinations occurred in 42 of the patients (visual: 16 %; non-visual: 35), delusions in 4, and minor symptoms in 45 (sense of presence, visual illusions, or passage hallucinations). The % % % % prevalence of PDAP was 43 when the usual definition was used (hallucinations and/or delusions) and 60 when the NINDS-NIHM % % criteria were used. Correlations between PDAP and patient characteristics varied with the definition of PDAP. These findings suggest that the epidemiology of PDAP should be re-evaluated with the new criteria. Minor symptoms and non-visual hallucinations {{are an important part of}} the PDAP spectrum, which has commonly been restricted to visual hallucinations and delusions.

40|$|Background Recent {{quantitative}} neuroimaging {{studies have}} been successful in capturing phenotype and genotype-speci fi c changes in dementia syndromes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, <b>Parkinson</b> ? <b>s</b> disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. However, the majority of imaging studies are cross-sectional, despite the obvious superiority of longitudinal study designs in characterising disease trajectories, response to therapy, progression rates and evaluating the presymptomatic phase of neurodegenerative conditions. Objectives The aim of this work is to perform a systematic review of longitudinal imaging initiatives in neurodegeneration focusing on methodology, optimal statistical models, follow-up intervals, attrition rates, primary study outcomes and presymptomatic studies. Methods Longitudinal imaging studies were identi fi ed from ? PubMed ? and reviewed from 1990 to 2014. The search terms ? longitudinal ?, ?

This blind case-control study was performed on 39 definitely diagnosed patients (of which 14 patients were excluded because of confounding variables) and 25 sex and age-adjusted controls in a neurologic referral center. The subjects were selected by consecutive sampling. Eleven patients in Farnsworth-Munsell and 3 patients in Lanthony showed normal function, however, overall patients had significantly weaker performance than controls (P-value= 0. 003 and 0. 000 for FM and Lanthony respectively). The pattern of responses in Lanthony was consistent with a mild tritanomalia and had a significant correlation with the severity of motor signs and symptoms (Spearman coefficient= 0. 44, P-value= 0. 027). The weaker correlation of color deficiency with age in patients (Spearman coefficient= 0. 42) in comparison with controls (Spearman coefficient= 0. 60) also signifies the role of the pathophysiology of the disease.

40|$|<b>Parkinson</b> 3 <b>s</b> disease (PD) {{is largely}} {{attributed}} to disruptions in the nigrostriatal dopamine system. These neurodegenerative changes {{may also have}} a more global effect on intrinsic brain organization at the cortical level. Functional brain connectivity between neurocognitive systems related to cognitive processing is critical for effective neural communication, and is disrupted across neurological disorders. Three core neurocognitive networks have been established as playing {{a critical role in}} the pathophysiology of many neurological disorders: the default-mode network (DMN), the salience network (SN), and the central executive network (CEN). In healthy adults, DMN–CEN interactions are anti-correlated while SN–CEN interactions are strongly positively correlated even at rest, when individuals are not engaging in any task. These intrinsic between-network interactions at rest are necessary for efficient suppression of the DMN and activation of the CEN during a range of cognitive tasks. To identify whether these network interactions are disrupted in individuals with PD, we used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to compare between-network connectivity between 24 PD participants and 20 age-matched controls (MC). In comparison to the MC, individuals with PD showed significantly less SN–CEN coupling and greater DMN–CEN coupling during rest. Disease severity, an index of striatal dysfunction, was related to reduced functional coupling between the striatum and SN. These results demonstrate that individuals with PD have a dysfunctional pattern of interaction between core neurocognitive networks compared to what is found in healthy individuals, and that interaction between the SN and the striatum is even more profoundly disrupted in those with greater disease severity...|$|R

This cyclic nucleotide plays a key role in signal transduction in a wide variety of cellular responses. In the brain, cAMP has been implicated in learning, memory processes and other brain functions. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we show a novel function of phosphodiesterase 7 inhibition on nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal death. We found that S 14, a heterocyclic small molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 7, conferred significant neuronal protection against different insults both in the human dopaminergic cell line SH-SY 5 Y and in primary rat mesencephalic cultures. S 14 treatment also reduced microglial activation, protected dopaminergic neurons and improved motor function in the lipopolysaccharide rat model of <b>Parkinson</b> disease. Finally, <b>S</b> 14 neuroprotective effects were reversed by blocking the cAMP signaling pathways that operate through cAMP-dependent protein kinase A.

Patients were assessed with the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III, the Hoehn & Yahr stage standardization, <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> minimental test, the neurop-sychiatric inventory and the Beck Depression Inventory (IDB). The Zarit Burden Interview (ESZ) was applied to caregivers. Results: According to IDB, 45 % of patients whose caregiverspresented little or no burden had a depression, compared to 78 % of those whose caregivers had modérate or intense burden. (p < 0. 01). The ESZ score of caregivers correlated significantly with Parkinson patients' age, IDB and axial involvement in the UPDRS-III (correlation coefficients ofOAp < 0. 01, 0. 6 p < 0. 01 and 0. 46 p < 0. 01, respectively). Conclusions: Motor alterations, cognitive impairment and most importantly depression of patients with Parkinson disease are deteminants of burden for their caregivers...|$|E
40|$|This mini-review {{focuses on}} the {{processes}} and consequences of protein folding and misfolding. The latter process often leads to protein aggregation and precipitation with the aggregates adopting either highly ordered (amyloid fibril) or disordered (amorphous) forms. In particular, the amyloid fibril is discussed because this form has gained considerable notoriety due to its close links {{to a variety of}} debilitating diseases including Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s,</b> <b>Parkinson</b> 2 ̆ 7 s, Huntington 2 ̆ 7 s, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases, and type-II diabetes. In each of these diseases a different protein forms fibrils, yet the fibrils formed have a very similar structure. The mechanism by which fibrils form, fibril structure, and the cytotoxicity associated with fibril formation are discussed. The generic nature of amyloid fibril structure suggests that a common target may be accessible to treat amyloid fibril-associated diseases. As such, the ability of some molecules, for example, the small heat-shock family of molecular chaperone proteins, to inhibit fibril formation is of interest due to their therapeutic potential...|$|R
40|$|The pregenual {{anterior}} cingulate cortex (pACC) {{has been}} implicated in human anxiety disorders and depression, but the circuit-level mechanisms underlying these disorders are unclear. In healthy individuals, the pACC is involved in cost-benefit evaluation. We developed a macaque version of an approach-avoidance decision task used to evaluate anxiety and depression in humans and, with multi-electrode recording and cortical microstimulation, we probed pACC function as monkeys performed this task. We found that the macaque pACC has an opponent process-like organization of neurons representing motivationally positive and negative subjective value. Spatial distribution of these two neuronal populations overlapped in the pACC, except in one subzone, where neurons with negative coding were more numerous. Notably, microstimulation in this subzone, but not elsewhere in the pACC, increased negative decision-making, and this negative biasing was blocked by anti-anxiety drug treatment. This cortical zone could be critical for regulating negative emotional valence and anxiety in decision-making. National Institutes of Health (U. S.) (Javits Merit Grant R 01 NS 025529) United States.

50|$|The {{refurbishment}} saw significant {{structural changes}} {{made to the}} hotel/theatre complex. Initially, {{it was suggested that}} the theatre be largely remodelled to a two-tier concert hall design. However, architect Peter <b>S.</b> <b>Parkinson</b> resisted this push to fundamentally alter the design of the theatre and a sympathetic restoration was instead favoured. Within the auditorium, {{it was found that the}} reinforced concrete floor of the stalls was substandard and was completely replaced. Additionally, on one of the upper levels a wall was discovered which was not supported by a beam in accordance with the building plans. The much-maligned supporting pillars were shifted back to improve sight-lines for the audience. The raked stage was replaced with a new flat one, and the proscenium arch widened by 2 m and decorated with plaster mouldings of the original arch. The pressed-metal ceiling was also replaced with a plaster-moulded copy. The sliding dome in the roof was permanently sealed, and redecorated to match its original design from 1904. The orchestra pit was also expanded and new lighting and counterweights installed.|$|R
40|$|Background: The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 21 (DASS- 21) is a {{frequently}} used measure of emotional disturbance symptoms in <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease (PD). However, {{the factor structure}} of the DASS- 21 in PD has yet to be explored. Objective: To assess whether the scale is measuring these symptoms in PD {{in the same way as}} the general population. Methods: The present study fit a series of established DASS- 21 factor structures with both confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory structural equation modelling (ESEM) using data from 251 participants with PD. Results: The 3 -factor ESEM provided the best fit. The depression and stress scales fit well, however, few items on the anxiety subscale loaded clearly, with several items significantly loading onto the depression or stress factors. Conclusions: Whilst the depression and stress subscales appear suitable in PD, poor loadings and internal consistency indicate the anxiety subscale may not accurately assess anxiety symptomology in PD. This may be due to the scale s reliance on physiological symptoms as indicators of anxiety, when many of these are present in PD. Thus, the anxiety subscale of the DASS- 21 may not be a suitable measure of anxiety in PD...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Normal {{cellular}} metabolism generates {{reactive oxygen species}} which interact with DNA, lipids and proteins in cells. Cellular damage due to oxidative stress is proposed {{to contribute to the}} pathophysiology of cancer, neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer s and <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> and to the process of aging. The central nervous system is thought to be particularly susceptible to oxidative stress due to the high rate of oxygen consumption. Base excision DNA repair (BER) is the major pathway that removes oxidative DNA base lesions. Among hundreds of lesions, 7, 8 -dihydro- 8 -oxoguanine (8 -oxoG) is believed {{to be one of the}} most important oxidized lesions due to their relatively high incidence and their miscoding properties. OGG 1 (8 -oxoguanine DNA glycosylase- 1) is one of the main DNA glycosylases present in mammalian cells that removes 7, 8 -dihydro- 8 -oxoguanine (8 -oxoG) lesions. In this study we have investigated 8 -oxoG repair capacity of neurospheres derived from newborn and adult mice. We show that Ogg 1 is the major glycosylase initiating 8 -oxoG repair. Moreover 8 -oxoG activity decrases with age and upon cell differentiation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{solution}} to the problem of handling scribal abbreviations in TEI-conformant transcriptions of medieval texts, following a conservative editorial strategy. A key distinction is drawn between alphabetic abbreviations, which represent sequences of letters, and logographic abbreviations which represent whole words. The TEI elements and can be used systematically to separate these two types: alphabetic abbreviations will be expanded in the main text, recording the abbreviated form (including TEI entities representing the main abbreviation marks) as an attribute of, while logographic abbreviations will be represented in their abbreviated form, with the expanded form recorded as an attribute of. The proposals are illustrated from common abbreviations and short text samples from tenth-century Latin-Portuguese and thirteenth-century Old Portuguese.

40|$|The {{ability of}} small heat-shock {{proteins}} (sHsps) such as alphaB-crystallin to inhibit the amorphous (disordered) aggregation of varied target proteins in a chaperone-like manner {{has been well}} described. The mechanistic details of this action are not understood. Amyloid fibril formation is an alternative off-folding pathway that leads to highly ordered beta-sheet-containing aggregates. Amyloid fibril formation {{is associated with a}} broad range of protein conformational diseases such as Alzhiemer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s,</b> <b>Parkinson</b> 2 ̆ 7 s and Huntington 2 ̆ 7 s and sHsp expression is elevated in the protein deposits that are characteristic of these disease states. The ability of sHsps to prevent fibril formation has been less well characterised. It has been shown, however, that sHsps are potent inhibitors of fibril formation of a range of target proteins. In this chapter, the disease-related significance of this observation is discussed. Interestingly, in addition to being effective molecular chaperones, alphaA- and alpaB-crystallin themselves, along with some of their peptide fragments, readily form amyloid fibrils under slightly destabilising solution conditions. The implications of this observation in terms of protein conformational diseases, e. g. cataract, along with the potential nanotechnological applications of these fibrils, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{aggregation}} {{can proceed}} via disordered or ordered mechanisms, {{with the latter}} being associated with amyloid fibril formation, which {{has been linked to}} a number of debilitating conditions including Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s,</b> <b>Parkinson</b> 2 ̆ 7 s and Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases. Small heat-shock proteins (sHsps), such as alpha B-crystallin, act as chaperones to prevent protein aggregation and are thought to {{play a key role in}} the prevention of protein-misfolding diseases. In this study, we have explored the potential for small molecules such as arginine and guanidine to affect the chaperone activity of alpha B-crystallin against disordered (amorphous) and ordered (amyloid fibril) forms of protein aggregation. The effect of these additives is highly dependent upon the target protein undergoing aggregation. Importantly, our results show that the chaperone action of alpha B-crystallin against aggregation of the disease-related amyloid fibril forming protein alpha-synucleinA 53 T is enhanced in the presence of arginine and similar positively charged compounds (such as lysine and guanidine). Thus, our results suggest that target protein identity plays a critical role in governing the effect of small molecules on the chaperone action of sHsps. Significantly, small molecules that regulate the activity of sHsps may provide a mechanism to protect cells from the toxic protein aggregation that is associated with some protein-misfolding diseases...|$|R
40|$|Molecular chaperones are {{a diverse}} group of {{proteins}} that stabilise partially folded target proteins to prevent their misfolding, aggregation and potential precipitation under conditions of cellular stress, e. g. elevated temperature. Protein aggregation, particularly the formation of highly ordered protein aggregates termed amyloid fibrils, is of considerable research interest because of its intimate association {{with a wide range of}} debilitating diseases, including Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s,</b> <b>Parkinson</b> 2 ̆ 7 s and Huntington 2 ̆ 7 s diseases and type II diabetes. In this review, we discuss the ability of the milk casein proteins to act in a chaperone-like manner. This property is of biological importance since at least two of the casein proteins, αS 2 - and κ-casein, have a propensity to assemble into amyloid fibrils under physiological conditions. The fibril-forming propensity of α S 2 - and κ-casein, the possibility of its occurrence in mammary tissue, and the ability of the other casein proteins, α S 1 - and β-casein, to inhibit the aggregation of α S 2 - and κ-casein and other proteins, are discussed. The results have application in the use of casein proteins in a systematic manner to stabilise other proteins at high temperature and under shear conditions, as occurs in the industrial treatment of milk and milk-based products...|$|R
