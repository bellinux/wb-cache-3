40|$|Although {{confusion}} is generally {{perceived to be}} negative, educators dating {{as far back as}} Socrates, who asked students to question assumptions and wrestle with ideas, have challenged this notion. Can confusion be productive? How should instructors interpret student expressions of confusion? During two semesters of introductory physics that involved Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) and research-based reading materials, we evaluated performance on reading assignments while simultaneously measuring students’ self-assessment of their confusion over the <b>preclass</b> reading material (N = 137; Nfall = 106, Nspring = 88). We examined the relationship between confusion and correctness, confidence in reasoning, and (in the spring) precourse self-efficacy. We find that student expressions of confusion before coming to class are negatively related to correctness on <b>preclass</b> content-related questions, confidence in reasoning on those questions, and selfefficacy, but weakly positively related to final grade when controlling for these factors (β = 0. 23, p = 0. 03) ...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine if}} a university-level preliminary class concentrating upon the formalism and techniques germane to success in science would serve to improve minority academic performance, minority here being defined to include certain Asian Americans, Black Americans, Native Americans, Spanish surnamed Americans, and those white Americans who do not qualify for inclusion in the society of the white majority. Three hypotheses were investigated; namely: Ho ₁ There is no significant difference in academic performance in a typical university biology class between those societally liabiled freshmen who are exposed to <b>preclass</b> treatment and those who are not. Ho ₂ There is {{no significant difference between the}} academic performances exhibited in a typical university biology class by societally liabiled freshmen and societally liabiled sophomores who have had identical <b>preclass</b> treatment. Ho ₃ No significant difference in academic performance in a typical university biology class will be noted between societally liabiled sophomores who have been exposed to <b>preclass</b> treatment and societally liabiled freshmen who have not. Though some mortality later developed, a random selection of 64 students [...] 24 freshman experimental, 24 freshman control, 16 sophomore experimental [...] had administered to them the pretest, Science Form 2 A of Sequential Tests of Educational Progress-II. The converted scores were used as a measure of student background preparation in the sciences and as the covariant for a quantitative analysis. Treatment for the experimental groups was provided through Selected Topics-Science Education 199 X. Utilizing a composite curriculum involving concepts and techniques from Science Curriculum Irrprovement Study, Elementary Science Study, Experiences in Science, and the more traditional secondary and post-secondary curricula, the class focused upon seven major areas: Science as a Way of Knowing; Assumptions upon which Science is Based; Unification of the Sciences; Formalization of the Sciences; The Role of Science in a Technocracy; The Role of Science in One's Private Life; The Psychology of Science. Treatment was effected for one entire school term during which the class met three times a week for 11 weeks. Major emphasis in the course was upon the development and intensification of skills necessary to successful verbalization, laboratory testing, and hypothesis formation in science. Conducted in an informal manner, the class utilized exploration and discovery as incentives for invention, the more cognitive element in the curricular model. Following the term of experimental group treatment, all sample subjects were enrolled in General Science-Biology 102 which served as the second source of data for the empirical analysis. The curricular model for the class included traditional lecture sessions, informal recitation- problem sessions, laboratories, and staggered television presentations. Because of the routine randomization of students into general science classes, the sample populations were exposed to several different lecture instructors, class sections, and laboratories which afforded contact, in many cases, with instructors other than those who handled the lecture sessions. Academic evaluation of the students was based on points obtained from recitations, examinations, and laboratories. These points were used in the study as data for analysis. For a comparative investigation of the effect of the preliminary class, covariance analysis with the F test as a statistic was employed. The functional relationship involving adjustment means and variances in conjunction with the t test as a statistic was the model for a test of significant differences among groups. Findings 1. Students who are exposed to a preliminary science languagetechnique class exhibit academic performances in a subsequent typical university-level science class which are superior to those of students who have not been so exposed. Significant differences were obtained with each of the four test parameters: recitations, laboratories, examinations, and the total scores. 2. Freshmen and sophomores who have had identical <b>preclass</b> treatment do not differ significantly in academic performance in a subsequent typical university-level science class though some slight difference was observable in the area of examinations...|$|E

Experience from a Course in Game Theory: Pre- and Postclass Problem Sets as a Didactic Device* The paper summarizes my experience in teaching an undergraduate course in game theory in 1998. Students were required to submit two types of problem sets: <b>preclass</b> problem sets, which served as experiments, and postclass standard problem sets. The separation emphasizes the limited relevance of game theory as a tool for making predictions and giving advice. The paper summarizes the results of 41 experiments which were conducted during the course.

40|$|Marketing {{educators}} are often faced with poor <b>preclass</b> preparation by students, declining student interest in attending classes as the semester progresses, and student complaints regarding previous bad experiences with team assessment activities. Teambased learning (TBL) is an innovative teaching strategy using semiformalized guidelines aimed to enhance student engagement and improve teamwork and, hence, overcome the typical {{problems faced by}} educators. This case study examines the firsttime use of TBL in a postgraduate marketing subject at an Australian university. The {{results indicate that the}} TBL innovation has a positive influence on student engagement and offers opportunities to assist learning. The study concludes that TBL is an effective teaching process enabling educators to offer students enhanced and stimulating learning experiences. The case study contributes to the marketing education literature by assessing the first-time TBL experience of students and educator. Key issues addressed are student engagement, opportunities for learning, and the benefits of teamwork in preparing students for the workforce. Significantly, the research also offers practical advice for marketing educators desirous of developing and implementing effective and engaging pedagogy via TBL...|$|E
40|$|Formative {{assessments}} (FAs) {{can occur}} as <b>preclass</b> assignments, in-class activities, or postclass homework. FAs aim to promote student learning by accomplishing key objectives, including clarifying learning expectations, revealing student thinking to the instructor, providing {{feedback to the}} student that promotes learning, facilitating peer interactions, and activating student ownership of learning. While FAs have gained prominence within the education community, we have limited knowledge regarding student perceptions of these activities. We used a mixed-methods approach to determine whether students recognize and value the role of FAs in their learning and how students perceive course activities to align with five key FA objectives. To address these questions, we administered a midsemester survey in seven introductory biology course sections that were using multiple FA techniques. Overall, responses to both open-ended and closed-ended questions revealed {{that the majority of}} students held positive perceptions of FAs and perceived FAs to facilitate their learning in a variety of ways. Students consistently considered FA activities to have accomplished particular objectives, but there was greater variation among FAs in how students perceived the achievement of other objectives. We further discuss potential sources of student resistance and implications of these results for instructor practice...|$|E
40|$|In this article, I {{describe}} {{my experience}} of preparing and delivering {{a brand new}} computing undergraduate course in a new university and in doing so, share how the special institutional push of the active learning pedagogy of the university changed the way I prepared and delivered the course, and ended up transforming my own view of teaching. I was faced with an unusual cohort of students who were already familiar with active learning styles in classes, were proactive, vocal, and argumentative, were not afraid of making mistakes and of challenging the authorities, were extremely articulate expressing themselves and who had worked in a project- and team-based setting throughout the programme. As such, a very different method of teaching needed to be in place, not {{for the purpose of}} improving the in-class engagement, but out of necessity. In the process of creating and running this course, I witnessed a major shift in the allocation of my time, efforts and other resources: from general to specific, from teaching to advising to observing, from elaborate <b>preclass</b> preparations to impromptu, in-class discussions, thus bringing all my design skills and experiences to the table...|$|E
40|$|Actively {{engaging}} {{students in}} lecture {{has been shown}} to increase learning gains. To create time for active learning without displacing content we used two strategies for introducing material before class in a large introductory biology course. Four to five slides from 2007 / 8 were removed from each of three lectures in 2009 and the information introduced in <b>preclass</b> worksheets or narrated PowerPoint videos. In class, time created by shifting lecture material to learn before lecture (LBL) assignments was used to engage students in application of their new knowledge. Learning was evaluated by comparing student performance in 2009 versus 2007 / 8 on LBL-related question pairs, matched by level and format. The percentage of students who correctly answered five of six LBL-related exam questions was significantly higher (p < 0. 001) in 2009 versus 2007 / 8. The mean increase in performance was 21 % across the six LBL-related questions compared with < 3 % on all non-LBL exam questions. The worksheet and video LBL formats were equally effective based on a cross-over experimental design. These results demonstrate that LBLs combined with interactive exercises can be implemented incrementally and result in significant increases in learning gains in large introductory biology classes...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is the assessment of pedagogical interaction as a dimension of the learning environment through the personal representation of a teacher in the student’s personality, and the assessment of the nature and extent to which teachers are involved in changes of interpersonal dimensions of their student’s personality. This was examined by the assessment of the shift in egograms of a teacher’s students, as measured by the Interpersonal Check List (ICL). A 2 x 9 doubly multivariate repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted on the adult, parent, and child ego states as self-assessed by 187 students prior to the class period and after the class period, but still within the presence of the teacher. As hypothesized, the Time and the Class by Time results were statistically significant (p 3 ̆c. 05), indicating a general <b>preclass</b> to postclass change in ego state. The multivariate effect sizes averaged about. 065, which is subtle but detectible. The change in ego states were also significant (p = 0. 018) when assessed by a singly-ordered row by column table, {{in terms of the number}} of students within each class who presented either an increase or decrease in the number of items representative of the Adult, Parent, or Child ego states on the ICL. The shift in ego state was also evidenced by the decrease (average Spearman’s rho =. 45) in pre-post correlation (i. e., with the teacher in the classroom), as compared with test-retest (i. e., study hall with no teacher present) correlation (average rho of. 86) of ego states...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the flipped classroom (FC) approach depends on the integration of educational technologies into course design and delivery. This approach adopts constructivist learning principles and is increasingly used in higher education {{to respond to the}} need for greater flexibility and use of technologies in the design and delivery of program and courses. The FC comprises weekly <b>preclass</b> learning activities, face-to-face (F 2 F) workshops and tutorials, and extension online resources. Educational technologies are used to facilitate pre-class activities to engage students in course content prior to F 2 F interactions which then focus on further exploring concepts through group learning activities. Learning facilitators support student application of course concepts to assessment in tutorials and through extension resources. Each stage scaffolds students’ current understanding and increases cognition levels they are required to apply. The academics trialled the FC in Semester 1 2013 {{with the support of the}} Instructional Designer. They focused on developing their knowledge and confidence in transitioning from a traditional to a flipped teaching approach, and developing their skills in a broader range of educational technologies such as lectures, quizzes, etc. The academics are continuing to utilise the FC in their Semester 2, 2013 course and evaluating the impact of such an approach students engagement in learning. Critical reflection by the academics on their teaching approach transition, including the enhanced use of technologies, has been both rewarding and challenging. We would like to share these learnings was well as the future possibilities with others considering a similar venture...|$|E
40|$|This report {{explores the}} {{development}} of interactive, web-based activities in a Computer Science course for majors that meets {{the requirements of the}} Computer Science Accreditation Commission (CSAC) for a course in computer ethics and social impact. Starting from a project to develop a digital library to support a longstanding course in "Professionalism in Computing", this web-based version has steadily evolved into a modular resource that permits teachers at other institutions to construct their own versions of an ethics and social impact course. For the past two years the passive nature of the digital library approach has been revised to incorporate active-learning concepts. While maintaining the belief that the teaching of ethics and social impact still requires some classroom interaction between participants and collaborative development activities, each topical module has been augmented by on-line active-learning plans that involve pre-class, in-class, and post-class projects. The <b>preclass</b> activities allow participants to gain a basic understanding of the topic prior to the class, to review assigned readings from the library, to surf the web for additional resources, and possibly to participate in an opinion survey that can be used as the basis for an in-class discussion. Post-class projects involve the application of learned concepts to the lives of the participants and the institution. An on-line debate system that emulates an "Oxford Union" style debate, forcing participants to clearly take pro or con positions on arguments, {{is an integral part of}} the course, though also available as an independent module.

40|$|Based on a {{partnership}} between a teacher preparation program and an urban school district, this study evaluates a project that used a service-learning model to connect preservice teachers to working teachers to help the working teachers integrate technology into their teaching while giving the preservice teachers an authentic context for their assignments. Using multiple data sources including questionnaires, class projects, interviews, and field notes, this study looked at the success of service-learning in tech-nology instruction in terms of student satisfaction and student learning related to technology skills, technology integration strategies, and issues that teachers confront teaching diverse populations. The {{results of the study}} provide suggestions for the successful integration of service-learning for technology training in teacher education. Based on {{a partnership}} between a teacher preparation program at a large Midwest university and a local urban school district, this project employed a service-learning model to connect preservice teachers to working teachers to help the working teachers integrate technology into their practice while giving the preservice teachers an authentic context for their assignments. Reporting on this project, the following study was centered around two courses (a required educational technology course for preservice teachers that will be called <b>PRECLASS</b> and a technology integration course for working teachers that will be called INCLASS) that were taught {{at the same time and}} that presented similar content related to acquiring technol-ogy skills and developing technology integration knowledge. Participants in the study included 53 preservice teachers in early childhood education (K– 3) and seven working teachers who taught in elementary and second-ary contexts. The purpose of the study was to determine the success of service-learning in technology instruction in terms of student satisfaction and student learning related to technology skills, technology integration strategies, and issues that teachers confront while integrating technology into classrooms with diverse student populations...|$|E
40|$|In Experiment 1, 6 college {{students}} were given generalization tests using 25 line lengths as samples with a long line, a short line, and a "neither" option as comparisons. The neither option was to be used if a sample did not go with the other comparisons. Then, four-member equivalence classes were formed. Class 1 included three nonsense words and the short line. Class 2 included three other nonsense words and the long line. After repeating the generalization test for line length, additional tests were conducted using members of the equivalence classes (i. e., nonsense words and lines) as comparisons and intermediate-length lines as samples. All Class 2 comparisons were selected {{in the presence of}} the test lines that also evoked the selection of the long line in the generalization test that had been given before equivalence class formation. Class 1 yielded complementary findings. Thus, the <b>preclass</b> primary generalization gradient predicted which test lines acted as members of each equivalence class. Regardless of using comparisons that were nonsense words or lines, the post-class-formation gradients overlapped, showing the substitutability of class members. Experiment 2 assessed the discriminability of the intermediate-length test lines from the Class 1 (shortest) and Class 2 (longest) lines. The test lines that functioned as members of an equivalence class were discriminable from the line that was a member of the same class by training. Thus, these test lines also acted as members of a dimensionally defined class of "long" or "short" lines. Extension of an equivalence class, then, involved its merger with a dimensionally defined class, which converted a close-ended class to an open-ended class. These data suggest a means of predicting class membership in naturally occurring categories...|$|E
