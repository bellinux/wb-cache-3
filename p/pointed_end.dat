5|$|Pillars are a {{major part}} of Western Chalukya {{architecture}} and were produced in two main types: pillars with alternate square blocks and a sculptured cylindrical section with a plain square-block base, and bell-shaped lathe-turned pillars. The former type is more vigorous and stronger than the bell-shaped type, which is made of soapstone and has a quality of its own. Inventive workmanship was used on soapstone shafts, roughly carved into the required shapes using a lathe. Instead of laboriously rotating a shaft to obtain the final finish, workers added the final touches to an upright shaft by using sharp tools. Some pillars were left unpolished, as evidenced by the presence of fine grooves made by the <b>pointed</b> <b>end</b> of the tool. In other cases, polishing resulted in pillars with fine reflective properties such as the pillars in the temples at Bankapura, Itagi and Hangal. This pillar art reached its zenith in the temples at Gadag, specifically the Sarasvati Temple in Gadag city.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{striated}} muscle the <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> of polar actin filaments are {{directed toward the}} center of the sarcomer. Formed filaments keep a constant length of about 1 μm. As polymerization and depolymerization at free <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> are not sufficiently slow to account for the constant length of the filaments, we searched for proteins which occur in sarcomers and can stabilize the <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> of actin filaments. We observed that tropornyosintroponin complex reduces the rate of association and dissociation of actin molecules at the <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> more than 30 -fold. On the average, every 600 s one association or dissociation reaction has been found to occur at the <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> near the critical actin monomer concentration...|$|R

25|$|Building the Flatiron {{was made}} {{feasible}} by a change to New York City's building codes in 1892, which eliminated {{the requirement that}} masonry be used for fireproofing considerations. This {{opened the way for}} steel-skeleton construction. Since it employed a steel skeleton – with the steel coming from the American Bridge Company in Pennsylvania – it could be built to 22 stories (285feet) relatively easily, which would have been difficult using other construction methods of that time. It was a technique familiar to the Fuller Company, a contracting firm with considerable expertise in building such tall structures. At the vertex, the triangular tower is only 6.5 feet (2m) wide; viewed from above, this <b>pointed</b> <b>end</b> of the structure describes an acute angle of about 25 degrees.|$|E
25|$|A {{hand axe}} (or handaxe) is a prehistoric stone tool with two faces {{that is the}} longest-used tool in human history. It is usually made from flint or chert. It is {{characteristic}} of the lower Acheulean and middle Palaeolithic (Mousterian) periods. Its technical name (biface) {{comes from the fact}} that the archetypical model is generally bifacial Lithic flake and almond-shaped (amygdaloidal). Hand axes tend to be symmetrical along their longitudinal axis and formed by pressure or percussion. The most common hand axes have a <b>pointed</b> <b>end</b> and rounded base, which gives them their characteristic shape, and both faces have been knapped to remove the natural cortex, at least partially. Hand axes are a type of the somewhat wider biface group of two-faced tools or weapons.|$|E

500|$|The Navy went to Emerson, who {{designed}} and fabricated a working prototype within 24hours. They {{found that it}} met their needs, and the model was dubbed the [...] "SARK" [...] (Search and Rescue Knife). The SARK is a folding knife with a wharncliffe-style blade and a blunt tip designed so a rescuer could cut trapped victims free without stabbing them. The knife features Emerson's Wave. Seeing another need in the police community, Emerson replaced the blunt end of the SARK with a <b>pointed</b> <b>end</b> and named it the [...] "P-SARK", or Police Search And Rescue Knife. [...] In 2005, the Navy changed the requirements on the SARK to incorporate a guthook {{on the back of}} the blade for use as a line-cutter. [...] Emerson made the change on this model which is only available to the US Navy and the model designation is the NSAR (Navy Search And Rescue) Knife.|$|E
500|$|The large {{collection}} of spoons includes 51 cochlearia, which are small spoons with shallow bowls and long, tapering handles with a <b>pointed</b> <b>end</b> {{which was used}} to pierce eggs and spear small pieces of food—as the Romans did not use forks at the table. There are 23 cigni, which are much rarer, having large rather shallow spoons with shorter, bird-headed handles; and about 20 deep round spoons or small ladles and strainer-spoons. Many are decorated with abstract motifs and some with dolphins or fanciful marine creatures. Many of the spoons are decorated with a Christian monogram cross or Chi-Rho symbol, and sometimes, also with the Greek letters alpha and omega (an appellation for Jesus, who is described as the alpha and omega in the Book of Revelation). Three sets of ten spoons, and several other spoons, are decorated with such Christian symbols. As {{is often the case}} with Roman silver spoons, many also have a Latin inscription on them, either simply naming their owner or wishing their owner long life. In total, eight different people are named; seven on the spoons, and one on the single beaker in the hoard: Aurelius Ursicinus, Datianus, Euherius, Faustinus, Peregrinus, Quintus, Sanctus, and Silvicola. The most common name is [...] "Aurelius Ursicinus", which occurs on a set of five cochlearia and five ladles. It is unknown whether any of the people named in these inscriptions would have been involved in hiding the hoard or were even alive {{at the time it was}} buried.|$|E

2500|$|As {{indicated}} above, although actin hydrolyzes ATP, everything {{points to}} the fact that ATP is not required for actin to be assembled, given that, on one hand, the hydrolysis mainly takes place inside the filament, {{and on the other hand}} the ADP could also instigate polymerization. [...] This poses the question of understanding which thermodynamically unfavourable process requires such a prodigious expenditure of energy. The so-called “actin cycle”, which couples ATP hydrolysis to actin polymerization, consists of the preferential addition of G-actin-ATP monomers to a filament’s barbed end, and the simultaneous disassembly of F-actin-ADP monomers at the <b>pointed</b> <b>end</b> where the ADP is subsequently changed into ATP, thereby closing the cycle, this aspect of actin filament formation is known as “treadmilling”.|$|E
2500|$|Several oviraptorosaurian nests are known, {{with several}} oviraptorid {{specimens}} preserved in a brooding position over large clutches {{of up to}} {{a dozen or more}} eggs. The eggs are usually arranged in pairs, and forming a circular pattern within the nest. One oviraptorosaurian specimen from China has been found with two unlaid eggs within the pelvic canal. This suggests that, unlike modern crocodilians, oviraptorosaurs did not produce and lay many eggs at the same time. Rather, the eggs were produced within the reproductive organs in pairs, and laid two at a time, with the mother positioned {{in the center of the}} nest and rotating in a circle as each pair was laid. This behavior is supported by the fact that the eggs were shaped like highly elongated ovals, with the more <b>pointed</b> <b>end</b> pointing backward from the cloaca, and also oriented toward the center of the nest. Geochemical analysis also revealed that oviraptorosaurs incubated their eggs in the [...] range, as many modern bird species do today, based on the oxygen isotope ratios in the bones of the fossil embryos of various species during development.|$|E
2500|$|To {{illustrate}} that a wheelset trajectory follows a curved path, one may place a nail or screw {{on a flat}} table top {{and give it a}} push. [...] It will roll in a curved circle because the nail or screw is like a wheelset with extremely different diameter wheels. [...] The head is analogous to a large diameter wheel and the <b>pointed</b> <b>end</b> is like a small diameter wheel. [...] While the nail or screw will turn around in a full circle (and more) the railroad wheelset behaves differently because as soon at it starts to turn in a curve, the effective diameters change {{in such a way as}} to decrease the curvature of the path. [...] Note that [...] "radius" [...] and [...] "curvature" [...] refer to the curvature of the trajectory of the wheelset and not the curvature of the railway since this is perfectly straight track. [...] As the wheelset rolls on, the curvature decreases until the wheels reach the point where their effective diameters are equal and the path is no longer curving. [...] But the trajectory has a slope at this point (it is a straight line which crosses diagonally over the centerline of the track) so that it overshoots the centerline of the track and the effective diameters reverse (the formerly smaller diameter wheel becomes the larger diameter and conversely). [...] This results in the wheelset moving in a curve in the opposite direction. [...] Again it overshoots the centerline and this phenomenon continues indefinitely with the wheelset oscillating from side to side. [...] Note that the wheel flange never makes contact with the rail. [...] In this model, the rails are assumed to always contact the wheel tread along the same line on the rail head which assumes that the rails are knife-edge and only make contact with the wheel tread along a line (of zero width).|$|E

40|$|Tropomodulin (Tmod) is an actin pointed-end capping {{protein that}} regulates actin {{dynamics}} at thin filament <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> in striated muscle. Although pointed-end capping by Tmod controls thin filament lengths in assembled myofibrils, {{its role in}} length specification during de novo myofibril assembly is not established. We used the Drosophila Tmod homologue, sanpodo (spdo), to investigate Tmod's function during muscle development in the indirect flight muscle. SPDO {{was associated with the}} <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> of elongating thin filaments throughout myofibril assembly. Transient overexpression of SPDO during myofibril assembly irreversibly arrested elongation of preexisting thin filaments. However, the lengths of thin filaments assembled after SPDO levels had declined were normal. Flies with a preponderance of abnormally short thin filaments were unable to fly. We conclude that: (a) thin filaments elongate from their <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> during myofibril assembly; (b) <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> are dynamically capped at endogenous levels of SPDO so as to allow elongation; (c) a transient increase in SPDO levels during myofibril assembly converts SPDO from a dynamic to a permanent cap; and (d) developmental regulation of pointed-end capping during myofibril assembly is crucial for specification of final thin filament lengths, myofibril structure, and muscle function...|$|R
