50|$|Two {{different}} types of pulp cap are distinguished. In direct pulp capping, the <b>protective</b> <b>dressing</b> is placed directly over an exposed pulp; and in indirect pulp capping, {{a thin layer of}} softened dentin, that if removed would expose the pulp, is left in place and the <b>protective</b> <b>dressing</b> is placed on top. A direct pulp cap is a one-stage procedure, whereas an indirect pulp cap is a two-stage procedure over about six months.|$|E
50|$|Planting, using chitted seed potatoes, {{can be done}} at a depth some 2 cm {{deeper than}} normal since the plants are compact and easily lifted. To support {{irrigation}} requirements and nutritional qualities, Gala is also suitable for cultivation in relatively light soils. A <b>protective</b> <b>dressing</b> to counter Rhizoctonia is recommended.|$|E

2500|$|Current Australian Army {{orders of}} dress include ceremonial, general duties (polyesters), safari suit, DPCU, and mess dress (corps specific, worn by {{officers}} and senior SNCOs for formal dining occasions), {{in addition to}} specific dress for armoured fighting vehicle crewmen, working / <b>protective</b> <b>dress,</b> maternity dress, and aircrew. DPCU is generally worn as dress {{of the day in}} barracks, and when in the field or on operations (although this is presently being replaced by AMCU). The current ceremonial uniform is known as [...] "Service Dress". Changes to this uniform in 2016 have seen a return to a more traditional brown khaki worn prior to and during both World Wars, from the light olive drab khaki that was adopted in the 1990s as other items of dress were phased out. Darker than the previous uniform, it more closely matches the colour of the slouch hat. Ceremonial dress has also included [...] "Patrol Blue" [...] and [...] "White Jacket" [...] orders of dress, although these were mostly only worn at the Royal Military College, Duntroon. In 2010 the Army discontinued the wear of [...] "Patrol Blues", and cadets at Duntroon now exclusively wear [...] "White Jacket" [...] order of dress for ceremonial occasions such as graduation parade.|$|R

The community was {{also involved in}} the manufacture of <b>protective</b> leather <b>dresses</b> for soldiers and as such were closely associated with army. The word mochi is derived from the Sanskrit mochika, meaning a cobbler. Traditionally, the Mochi was the cobbler and shoemaker of village India.|$|R
50|$|A mustard plaster is a {{poultice}} {{of mustard}} seed powder spread inside a <b>protective</b> <b>dressing</b> {{and applied to}} the body to stimulate healing. It {{can be used to}} warm muscle tissues and for chronic aches and pains. It was once part of conventional medical treatment, and available in prepared versions in pharmacies. It fell from favor in the 20th century and is now only used as a home remedy.|$|E
50|$|The {{patient is}} {{requested}} to urinate before the procedure; alternately, a Foley catheter {{is used to}} empty the bladder. The patient is positioned in the bed with the head elevated at 45-60 degrees to allow fluid to accumulate in lower abdomen. After cleaning {{the side of the}} abdomen with an antiseptic solution, the physician numbs a small area of skin and inserts a large-bore needle with a plastic sheath 2 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in) in length to reach the peritoneal (ascitic) fluid. The needle is removed, leaving the plastic sheath to allow drainage of the fluid. The fluid is drained by gravity, a syringe or by connection to a vacuum bottle. Several litres of fluid may be drained during the procedure; however, if more than two litres are to be drained it will usually be done {{over the course of several}} treatments. After the desired level of drainage is complete, the plastic sheath is removed and the puncture site bandaged. The plastic sheath can be left in place with a flow control valve and <b>protective</b> <b>dressing</b> if further treatments are expected to be necessary.|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} adhesive-retained extraoral facial {{prostheses}} depends on retention of the artificial {{part to the}} skin that is often scarred secondary to surgery and/or radiation treatment. Facial prostheses are re-tained by adhesives, mechanical means, and/or craniofacial implants. 1 - 4 Attaching prostheses to the skin with an adhesive is an effective and commonly used method. The interaction of adhesive materials with skin presents problems, such as the longevity of the bond, dermatologic (sensitivity) problems, {{and the ability to}} completely remove adhesive residue. Mainte-nance of the skin and prosthesis requires considerable daily effort and dexterity by the patient. Skin-Prep <b>protective</b> <b>dressing</b> (Smith & Nephew, Inc, Largo, Fla.) (isopropyl alcohol, butyl ester of polyvinyl methacrylate/methyl methacrylate copoly-mer, acetyl tributyl citrate) is used where “skin needs protection from adhesive, trauma, abrasion, chafing, irritation, and exposure to fecal and urinary effluent” (according to Smith & Nephew product literature). It “creates a physical, waterproof barrier that is nonirri-tating…and allows the skin to breathe. ” Wilborn 5 studied skin punch biopsies by SEM to determine the effect of adhesive tape removal on skin protected by Skin-Prep <b>protective</b> <b>dressing.</b> Trauma was reduced when this product was used.

30|$|Polymeric nanofibers {{obtained}} through electrospinning {{can be used}} in many fields in industry: scaffolds, sensors, filters, membranes, batteries, <b>protective</b> clothing, wound <b>dressing,</b> and catalyst [10]. In the textile area, nanofibers are used to get specific functionalities such as self-cleaning fabrics, virus and bacteria repellent, temperature control, sensors, and filters [11]. Also, some other textile applications have been reported as antibacterial clothing [12], wound dressings [13], and protective clothing [14] thanks to their chemical properties and mechanical strength.|$|R
30|$|Polyurethane (PU) is {{composed}} of soft and hard segments connected by a urethane linkage, in which the soft segments impart flexibility, whereas the hard segments provide the rigidity and strength [8, 9]. PU materials {{have been widely used}} in industry since its hardness can be easily modulated by changing the hard-segment in the structure [10]. Electrospun PU nanofibers have a wide variety of potential applications in high-performance air filters, <b>protective</b> textiles, wound <b>dressing</b> films, and sensors [11, 12]. Understanding the mechanical properties is essential for the application and function of nanomaterials [13]. However, too little {{attention has been paid to}} the study of mechanical properties of electrospun nanofibers due to the difficulties in making a nanoscale test. In the past decade, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to characterize the mechanical properties of 1 D nanostructure in a straightforward way [14 – 16]. A facile AFM-based three-point bending test has been designed to measure the Young’s modulus of a single nanofiber, which involves clamping the 1 D nanostructure across a trench by the self-adhesion between the sample and substrate. The midpoint of the suspended 1 D nanostructure is subjected to a force applied by the AFM tip, and then, the corresponding deflection at the midpoint is recorded and used to calculate the Young’s modulus. Here, PU nanofibers were prepared from electrospun method. And then three-point bending test was employed to study the effect of temperature on the Young’s modulus of PU nanofibers.|$|R
40|$|MOST hand infections {{cannot be}} traced to a precise source, though {{it is likely that}} in all of them a minor, unnoticed breach of skin surface has allowed entry of pyogenic organisms. Prophylaxis is {{therefore}} difficult, but attention to pricks, small cuts or abrasions as soon as they are sustained, simple cleansing or the early application of a <b>protective</b> <b>dressing</b> will help to reduce them. Industrial and household gloves and barrier creams are also useful. The chance of a minor injury giving rise to a hand infection is increased in those whose skin habitually harbours pathogens. Williams and Miles (I 949) showed that hand infections after minor injury occur more often in carriers of staphylococcus aureus, and the infectin...|$|E
40|$|Endodontic and {{restorative}} {{considerations are}} of primary {{significance in the}} treatment of tooth fractures. Since exposed dentinal tubules permit invasion of bacteria into the endodontic system, a <b>protective</b> <b>dressing</b> must be applied as part of the emergency treatment. Provided the dentin wound has been sealed, restorative treatment can also be carried out at a later stage. The fractured tooth fragment can be reattached using adhesive protocols in order to restore function and esthetic appearance. If reattachment is difficult or impossible, eg, in cases of multiple or missing fragments, current composite materials enable excellent esthetic results. Minimally-invasive direct composite restorations are preferred over the more invasive indirect restorations, at least in immature teeth with an extensive coronal pulp dimension. Restorative treatment of crown-root fractures is frequently demanding due to inaccessible subgingival fracture margins. Extrusion of the remaining root is an alternative method to surgical crown lengthening for re-establishing the biological width. This can be carried out either orthodontically (forced eruption), or surgically (intra-alveolar transplantation). Although the treatment of crown-root fractures {{is one of the most}} technically sensitive procedures in dental traumatology and is frequently considered as a long-term temporary restoration, tooth conservation up to the age at which implants can be placed may be regarded as a success...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} work Co/Mo(CO 3) 2 −-LDH {{material}} of highly energetic surface was prepared by controlled titration of ammonium carbonate and ammonium hydroxide against Co and Mo cations at elevated temperatures, while different analytical techniques {{were applied to}} proof the chemical constitution and surface features of the material as XPS (X-ray Photoelectric Spectroscopy) in addition to XRF metal analysis, FT-IR, SEM, XRD, DSC-TGA and N 2 adsorption–desorption isotherm. The highly energetic surface due to formation of 4 + surface charge in the brucite layer between Co and Mo as confirmed by XPS was practically ensured when the freshly prepared Co 2 +Mo 6 +-LDH dried at 60 °C overnight without any activation has been applied as a novel adsorbent {{for the removal of}} the undesirable compounds (sulfur and aromatics compounds) from crude waxes. Suez crude petrolatum has been used during this study. Depending on the experimental data, we were successful to prepare a new type of LDHs showed high ability for removing the undesirable compounds (sulfur and aromatics) from Suez crude petrolatum. Also, in the same trend it removed low melting waxes. This leads to isolation of microcrystalline waxes from petroleum wastes which used as a lubricant, rust preventive, in the manufacture of cosmetics, and in medicine as a <b>protective</b> <b>dressing,</b> emollient, and in a lot of industrial applications...|$|E
40|$|Current status: Safe process {{treatment}} {{should be}} provided to every patient in every hospital. Nurses should work to avoid security violation, especially in the surgical field, associated with irreversible changes in the treatment process. Perfect mastery of these measures assures patient safety. Risk prevention, safety of {{the patient and the}} medical personnel require the involvement of all members of the multidisciplinary team (Pokojová, 2011; Škrla and Škrlová, 2003). Objective of the research: to map the attributes of postoperative care in the safe treatment of patients. To determine whether nurses master preventive measures in safe patient care and whether they ensure compliance with the principles of safe care in practice. Methods: the research analysis was chosen to be based on qualitative research method. Data acquisition was performed in semi-structured interview with nurses, supplemented with hidden observation. The participation in the interviews was voluntary and anonymous. Audio data was recorded from the interviews and transcribed verbatim. The observation aimed to determine whether nurses respect the principles of safe care for patients in the postoperative care. Research cohort: consisted of general nurses who worked at the surgical wards and recovery room. The research was conducted in one of the hospitals of South Bohemia. Twelve nurses were interviewed. The interview and hidden observation were focused on patient safety in the postoperative period. The interviews were performed at nurse day-time rooms of individual surgical wards, some of them outside the hospital. All nurses met the criterion to be a provider of nursing care for post-operative patients at surgical wards and recovery rooms. The interviews were finished when reaching the theoretical saturation, when the answers and hidden observation of the respondents started to repeat the already acquired data, i. e. after twelve interviews and observations. Results: The nurses working in surgical wards and recovery rooms are exposed to a considerable mental and physical strain. This profession is very demanding and requires not only theoretical knowledge, but also manual dexterity in practice. Nurses are involved in the care process in a considerable extent. Therefore, {{it is important that the}} care was good and safe. In the treatment process, the nurses sometimes do not comply with relevant standards and the requirements for safe treatment. It is essential to follow the identification bracelets to avoid patient mismatch, thus endangering patients' health. Some nurses checked the identification bracelets thoroughly, but there were also nurses who ignored these rules too much and gamble with the patients' health. Medication errors are the most common cause of patient injury. The risk of medication errors increases also due to improper storage of hazardous drugs. In our investigation, the medication was repeatedly stored at a different place (not returned back to the original area), poorly stored or left freely available to anyone. If the physician records are illegible, the nurses solve the issue rather by guessing or asking an assistance from colleagues in the department. This area also includes replacement of medication by nurses if the prescribed product is not available at the ward, without consulting a physician first. The negligence in the use of <b>protective</b> equipment during <b>dressing</b> changes is alarming. Possible transmission of nosocomial infections. Poor or little use of disinfectants. Conclusions: Treatment of patients in the early and late postoperative care is one of the high risk parts of the hospitalization of patients at healthcare facilities. In this period, patient monitoring and risk prevention are essential. It includes pain control, the care for surgical wounds, safe patient identification, prevention of adverse events in both medication administration and patient falls, the compliance with hand hygiene [...] ...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Polyhedral {{oligomeric}} silsesquioxane {{is making}} advancements towards medical application {{as an effective}} material for drug delivery. POSS is a unique molecule because of its structure. It is a class of organosilicon- three-dimensional compounds with cage frameworks and different degrees of symmetry. OBJECTIVE Our objective was to introduce a biomedical application for POSS in area of drug delivery. For large open wounds it should have a capability to reduce bleeding and {{as well as provide}} the release of an antibiotics to reach minimal inhibitory concentrations at the site for infection coverage. If the treatment is successful POSS can be applied in the field as a <b>protective</b> <b>dressing</b> that is capable of enhancing clot formation prevent infection and ultimately enhance tissue repair. METHODS Two formulations of POSS were prepared and tested in vitro to release inhibitory concentration of Clindamycin. Clindamycin release was determined spectrophotometrically and the MIC was determined using a bacterial pig skin wound model were determined. RESULTS Minimal inhibitory concentration of Clindamycin was detected from both POSS formulation for up to 96 hours. In the pig skin wound model the POSS formulation without kaolin reduced the bacterial load more efficiently than POSS containing kaolin and was comparable to a triple antibiotic cream coverage. CONCLUSION Nanocomposites of POSS can be formulated to limit bacterial growth and further reduction of bacterial load can be accomplished by attaching an antibiotic to the functional groups of the caged nanostructure of POSS...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical pulp {{exposure}} by a {{rotary cutting}} instrument or a hand-cutting instrument often happens in deep caries. Application of <b>protective</b> <b>dressing</b> can protect the pulp from additional injury by facilitating healing and repair. Pulp capping {{has been suggested}} as one treatment of choice after pulp exposure to maintain pulp vitality. TGF- β 1 is growth factor that has important rule in wound healing. The application of Ca(OH) 2 and exogenous TGF- β 1 as direct pulp capping tr 4 eatment must be experimented in-vivo to see the vacuolization and necrosis in 7, 14, and 21 days after application. This research was done in vivo experiment from orthodontic patients indicated for premolar extraction, between ages 10 – 15 years.
