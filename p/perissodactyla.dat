5|$|Bats are placental mammals. They were {{formerly}} grouped in the superorder Archonta, {{along with}} the treeshrews (Scandentia), colugos (Dermoptera), and the primates, because of the apparent similarities between Megachiroptera and such mammals. Genetic evidence places bats in the superorder Laurasiatheria, with its sister taxon as Fereuungulata, which includes carnivorans, pangolins, odd-toed ungulates, even-toed ungulates, and cetaceans. One study places Chiroptera as a sister taxon to odd-toed ungulates (<b>Perissodactyla).</b>|$|E
5|$|The horse {{adapted to}} survive in areas of wide-open terrain with sparse vegetation, {{surviving}} in an ecosystem where other large grazing animals, especially ruminants, could not. Horses and other equids are odd-toed ungulates of the order <b>Perissodactyla,</b> a group of mammals that was dominant during the Tertiary period. In the past, this order contained 14families, but only three—Equidae (the horse and related species), Tapiridae (the tapir), and Rhinocerotidae (the rhinoceroses)—have survived to the present day.|$|E
5|$|Horses are {{odd-toed}} ungulates, {{or members}} of the order <b>Perissodactyla.</b> This order also includes the extant species of rhinos and tapirs, and many extinct families and species. Members of this order walk on either one toe (like horses) or three toes (like rhinos and tapirs). This {{is in contrast to}} even-toed ungulates, members of the order Artiodactyla, which walk on cloven hooves, or two toes. This order includes many species associated with livestock, such as sheep, goats, pigs, cows and camels, as well as species of giraffes, antelopes and deer.|$|E
5|$|Sirenians are {{classified}} within the cohort Afrotheria in the clade Paenungulata, alongside Proboscidea (elephants), Hyracoidea (hyraxes), Embrithopoda, Desmostylia, and Afroinsectiphilia. This clade was first established by George Gaylord Simpson in 1945 based on anatomical evidence, such as testicondy and similar fetal development. The Paenungulata, {{along with the}} Afrotheria, {{are one of the}} most well-supported mammalian clades in molecular phylogeny. Sirenia, Proboscidae, and Desmotylia are grouped together in the clade Tethytheria. Based on morphological similarities, Tethytheria, <b>Perissodactyla,</b> and Hyracoidea were considered to be grouped together as the Altungulata, but this has been invalidated by molecular data.|$|E
25|$|<b>Perissodactyla</b> (odd-toed ungulates) {{are closer}} to Carnivora and bats than to Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates).|$|E
25|$|In the 2000s {{understanding}} of the relationships among eutherian mammals has experienced a virtual revolution. Molecular phylogenomics, new fossil finds and innovative morphological interpretations now group the more than 4600 extant species of eutherians into four major super-ordinal clades: Euarchontoglires (including Primates, Dermoptera, Scandentia, Rodentia, and Lagomorpha), Laurasiatheria (Cetartiodactyla, <b>Perissodactyla,</b> Carnivora, Chiroptera, Pholidota, and Eulipotyphla), Xenarthra, and Afrotheria (Proboscidea, Sirenia, Hyracoidea, Afrosoricida, Tubulidentata, and Macroscelidea). This tree is very useful in unifying the parts of a puzzle in comparative mammalian cytogenetics.|$|E
25|$|Chalicotherium, {{like many}} members of <b>Perissodactyla,</b> was adapted to browsing, though uniquely adapted to do so among its {{ungulate}} relatives. Its arms were long and heavily clawed, allowing them to walk on their knuckles only. The arms were used {{to reach for the}} branches of large trees and bring them close to its long head to strip them clean of leaves. The horse-like head itself shows adaptation to a diet of soft vegetation, since, as the animal reached sexual maturity, the incisors and upper canines were shed, suggesting that its muscular lips and the resulting gum pads were enough to crop fodder which was then processed by squarish, low-crowned molars.|$|E
25|$|The horse {{belongs to}} the order <b>Perissodactyla</b> (odd-toed ungulates), the members of which all share hooved feet and an odd number of toes on each foot, as well as mobile upper lips and a similar tooth structure. This means that horses share a common ancestry with tapirs and rhinoceroses. The perissodactyls arose in the late Paleocene, less than 10 million years after the Cretaceous–Paleogene {{extinction}} event. This group of animals {{appears to have been}} originally specialized for life in tropical forests, but whereas tapirs and, to some extent, rhinoceroses, retained their jungle specializations, modern horses are adapted to life on drier land, in the much harsher climatic conditions of the steppes. Other species of Equus are adapted to a variety of intermediate conditions.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} living mammals, the more {{striking}} of Owen's contributions {{relate to the}} monotremes, marsupials and the anthropoid apes. He {{was also the first}} to recognize and name the two natural groups of typical Ungulate, the odd-toed (<b>Perissodactyla)</b> and the even-toed (Artiodactyla), while describing some fossil remains, in 1848. Most of his writings on mammals, however, deal with extinct forms, to which his attention seems to have been first directed by the remarkable fossils collected by Charles Darwin, in South America. Toxodon, from the pampas, was then described and gave the earliest clear evidence of an extinct generalized hoof animal, a pachyderm with affinities to the Rodentia, Edentata and herbivorous Cetacea. Owen's interest in South American extinct mammals then led to the recognition of the giant armadillo, which he named Glyptodon (1839) and to classic memoirs on the giant ground-sloths, Mylodon (1842) and Megatherium (1860), besides other important contributions. Owen also first described the false killer whale in 1863.|$|E

2500|$|Chalicotherium (Ancient Greek χαλιξ/khalix, khalik-: pebble/gravel + θηρίον/thērion, {{diminutive}} of θηρ/thēr : beast) is a genus of extinct browsing {{odd-toed ungulates}} {{of the order}} <b>Perissodactyla</b> and family Chalicotheriidae, found in Europe, Africa, and Asia during the Late Oligocene to Lower Pliocene, living from 28.4—3.6 million years ago, existing for approximately [...]|$|E
2500|$|Teeth {{form from}} the top down through the {{deposition}} of enamel on a cement core by formative soft tissue in the jaw. The enamel of hypsodont <b>Perissodactyla</b> is highly rugose rather than sharp. In brachydont species, such as humans, when the crown is complete, the roots are deposited and finally the completed tooth erupts. Hypselodonty is a condition of tooth eruption and continued crown formation before a delayed root formation. In its most developed variety, the roots never form. Only rare fossils of E. show any sign of a root, and that on a premolar. No molars have roots, or, in the terminology of some, the roots are [...] "open".|$|E
2500|$|A 2007 {{study by}} Mendoza and Palmqvist {{compared}} the habitats and diets of 134 species of living ungulates, for which this data is known, both Artiodactyla and <b>Perissodactyla,</b> against [...] "32 craniodental measurements" [...] {{to discover what}} correlations exist for the group studied and to test hypotheses concerning hypsodonty and mode of life. Habitats considered were open (savanna, deserts), mixed (wooded savanna, brush) and closed (riverine and forest). Diets considered were grazing, mixed grazing and browsing, browsing, omnivory and special niches, such as treetop browsing. Measurements included the Hypsodonty Index (HI) and Muzzle Width (MZW). The results showed that, except for the [...] "high-level" [...] browsers, hypsodonty is correlated to [...] "open and mixed habitats". The HI was not precise enough to discriminate between open and mixed. However, high MZW is correlated to grazing in the open category, although some forest species also have wide muzzles. Grazers therefore are distinguished {{by a combination of}} high-crowned cheek teeth and wide muzzles, both of which are possessed by Elasmotherium. Life in the open is implied.|$|E

Just call {{up in your}} mind the picture of your own Maggie or Vera or Beatrice, straighten her nose, soften her voice, tone her down and then tone her up, make her beautiful and unattainable--and you have a faint dry-point etching of Alice. The family owned a crumbly brick house and a coachman named Joseph in a coat of many colours, and a horse so old that he claimed {{to belong to the}} order of the <b>Perissodactyla,</b> and had toes instead of hoofs. In the year 1898 the family had to buy a new set of harness for the Perissodactyl. Before using it they made Joseph smear it over with a mixture of ashes and soot. It was the Von der Ruysling family that bought the territory between the Bowery and East River and Rivington Street and the Statue of Liberty, in the year 1649, from an Indian chief for a quart of passementerie and a pair of Turkey-red portières designed for a Harlem flat. I have always admired that Indian's perspicacity and good taste. All this is merely to convince you that the Von der Ruyslings were exactly the kind of poor aristocrats that turn down their noses at people who have money. Oh, well, I don't mean that; I mean people who have just money.|$|E
5000|$|According {{to recent}} studies (reflected in the diagram below), the closest {{relatives}} of Ferae are <b>Perissodactyla</b> (horses, tapirs, and rhinos) and Cetartiodactyla (which combines Artiodactyla—camels, pigs, ruminants and hippos—with Cetacea—whales and dolphins). [...] An alternate phylogeny (less supported) {{holds that the}} closest relatives to the Ferae are the <b>Perissodactyla</b> and Chiroptera (bats), not Cetartiodactyla.

50|$|Ancylopoda is a {{group of}} browsing, herbivorous, mammals in the <b>Perissodactyla</b> that show long, curved and cleft claws. Morphological {{evidence}} indicates the Ancylopoda diverged from the tapirs, rhinoceroses and horses (Euperissodactyla) after the Brontotheria, however earlier authorities such as Osborn sometimes considered the Ancylopoda to be outside <b>Perissodactyla</b> or, as was popular more recently, to be related to Brontotheria.|$|E
50|$|In 1884, Othniel Charles Marsh (1831-1899) came up {{with the}} concept Mesaxonia, which he used for what are today called the {{odd-toed}} ungulates, including their extinct relatives, but explicitly excluding the hyrax. Mesaxonia is now considered a synonym of <b>Perissodactyla,</b> but it was sometimes also used for the true odd-toed ungulates as a subcategory (rhinos, horses, tapirs), while <b>Perissodactyla</b> stood for the entire order, including the hyrax. The assumption that hyraxes were <b>Perissodactyla</b> was held well into the 20th century. Only with the advent of molecular genetic research methods had it been recognized that the hyrax is not closely related to perissodactyls but rather to elephants and manatees.|$|E

5000|$|Uncertainty {{still exists}} {{regarding}} the phylogenetic tree for extant laurasiatherians, {{primarily due to}} disagreement about the placement of Chiroptera and <b>Perissodactyla.</b> Based on morphological grounds, Chiroptera had long been classified in the superorder Archonta (e.g. along with treeshrews and the gliding colugos) until genetic research instead showed their kinship with the other laurasiatherians. [...] The studies conflicted {{in terms of the}} exact placement of Chiroptera, however, with it being linked most closely to groups such as Eulipotyphla, Ferae or with <b>Perissodactyla</b> and Ferae in the Pegasoferae proposal. [...] A recent study (Zhou et al., 2011) found that [...] "trees reconstructed ... for the 1,608-gene data set fully support ... a basal position for Eulipotyphla and a more apical position for Chiroptera" [...] (see cladogram below) and concluded that [...] "Pegasoferae ... does sic {{not appear to be a}} natural group." [...] The most recent study (Nery et al., 2012) supports the conclusions of Zhou et al. using a large genomic dataset, placing Eulipotyphla as a basal order and Chiroptera as sister to Cetartiodactyla, with maximal support for all nodes of their phylogenetic tree. The exact position of <b>Perissodactyla</b> remains less certain, with some studies linking it with Ferae into a proposed clade Zooamata while others unite it with Cetartiodactyla into Euungulata, a clade of 'true ungulates'; Zhou et al. found better (but not full) support for the latter, while Nery et al. found <b>Perissodactyla</b> to be sister to Carnivora.|$|E

50|$|Members of {{the order}} <b>Perissodactyla,</b> {{otherwise}} known as odd-toed ungulates, are mammals characterized by an odd number of toes and by hindgut fermentation with somewhat simple stomachs. <b>Perissodactyla</b> comes from the Ancient Greek περισσός (perissós, “uneven”) + δάκτυλος (dáktulos, “a finger, toe”). Unlike the even-toed ungulates, they digest plant cellulose in their intestines rather than {{in one or more}} stomach chambers. The order includes three extant families: Equidae (horses, asses, and zebras), Rhinocerotidae (rhinoceroses), and Tapiridae (tapirs), with a total of about 17 species. Despite their very different appearances, they were recognized as related families in the 19th century by the zoologist Richard Owen, who also coined the order name.|$|E
