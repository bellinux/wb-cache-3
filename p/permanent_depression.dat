40|$|Synaptic {{plasticity}} {{is considered}} essential {{for learning and}} storage of new memories. Whether all synapses on a given neuron have the same ability to express long-term plasticity is not well understood. Synaptic microanatomy could affect the function of local signaling cascades and thus differentially regulate the potential for plasticity at individual synapses. Here, we investigate how the presence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in dendritic spines of CA 1 pyramidal neurons affects postsynaptic signaling. We show that the ER is targeted selectively to large spines containing strong synapses. In ER-containing spines, we frequently observed synaptically triggered calcium release events of very large amplitudes. Low-frequency stimulation of these spines induced a <b>permanent</b> <b>depression</b> of synaptic potency that was independent of NMDA receptor activation and specific to the stimulated synapses. In contrast, no functional changes were induced {{in the majority of}} spines lacking ER. Both calcium release events and long-term depression depended on the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors and inositol trisphosphate receptors. In summary, spine microanatomy is a reliable indicator for the presence of specific signaling cascades that govern plasticity on a micrometer scale...|$|E
40|$|AbstractReperfusion early during {{myocardial}} infarction improves ejection fraction and this improvement may represent myocardial salvage in the injured segment. Alternatively, reperfusion of injured myocardium may cause intramyocardial hemorrhage with resultant increased stiffness causing a dyskinetic segment to become akinetic, thus improving ejection fraction without concomitant myocardial salvage. To evaluate this possibility, diastolic stiffness was assessed {{in a closed}} chest, anesthetized, normothermic dog model immediately after a 1 or 3 h occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and during the 4 weeks after occlusion. Acute {{myocardial infarction}} in experimental dogs {{was accompanied by a}} fivefold increase in the chamber stiffness constant, a threefold increase in the myocardial stiffness constant and a significant increase in elastic stiffness and end-diastolic pressure. These changes occurred contemporaneously with a marked decline in ejection fraction. Early reperfusion (1 h occlusion) resulted in improvement of the ejection fraction accompanied by simultaneous resolution of the previously increased stiffness. Late reperfusion (3 h occlusion) resulted in <b>permanent</b> <b>depression</b> of ejection fraction with permanent elevation of stiffness. These results indicate that the improved systolic function observed after early reperfusion reflects a process other than increased stiffness, perhaps salvage of jeopardized myocardium...|$|E

The Simmler is exposed in a narrow, folded strip along the northern side of the Ozena fault. Eight members, herein informally designated A through H, are recognized. Rocks of Members A and B consist of southeastern fluvial conglomerate, sandstone, and mudstone and northwestern sabkha claystone and mudstone deposits. The fluvial deposits originated from low-sinuosity meandering streams which in turn flowed into locally evaporative sabkha areas.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} accessibility of waterways under coastal development, recreational boating is among the growing disturbances to seagrasses at the local scale. While previous studies indicate that in decreasing and fragmenting seagrass habitat, boating can impact the diverse faunal assemblages associated with this habitat, direct impacts of boatwake on phytal invertebrates have not been assessed. By sampling seagrassblades twice before, immediately after and 1 h after exposure to recreational boatwake, this study documented the displacement of macroinvertebrates from flapping seagrassblades. At wake-exposed sites, up to five-fold decreases in the total abundances of amphipods and polychaetes and two-fold deceases in taxon richness were evident from immediately before to immediately after the disturbance of wake. By contrast, at control sites, the abundance and richness of these taxa remained fairly unchanged during the study {{and in some cases}} even increased. Although many of the displaced taxa were mobile, additional sampling indicated that they did not completely recolonize seagrass patches within 1 h of the disturbance. Thus, in places where boat traffic is relatively frequent, <b>permanent</b> <b>depression</b> of abundances of macroinvertebrates in seagrass may occur. This is of concern given that macroinvertebrates fuel fisheries productivity. Thus, in areas with frequent and or intense boating activity, nursery functions of seagrass beds may be severely compromised. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{present report}} is {{concerned}} with the pharmacological properties of a series of furfuryl-amine derivatives synthesized and described by Zanetti and Bashour (1939, 1940). No previous pharmacological investigation of these products could be found in the literature. The parent substances for this series of furfuryl amines are a. -Furfurane; b. -Furfural; c. -Methyl-furfurane; and d. -Furfuryl-amine. McGuigan (3) found that furfural was slightly antiseptic; that it was highly toxic to frogs resulting in convulsions; and that locally it was anesthetic. In mammals the administration of furfural resulted in depression followed by paralysis and death. He reviews the pertinent literature (see also 1). Koch and Cohan (2) found that furfurane administered to rats and rabbits by inhalation resulted in convulsions of medullary origin followed by re-spiratory paralysis and death. Injection of 1. 5 cc. of furfurane into a dog weighing 10 kilograms caused immediate death. When the drug was given orally to rabbits death followed immediately in one case and in 24 hours in another. Post-mortem examination revealed hyperemia of the lungs, generalized venous dilatation and a cherry-red color of the blood resembling that seen in cyanide poisoning. Fujii (1 b and c) reported upon the pharmacological activity of furfur-ethyl-amine and of furfur-methyl-amine (furfuryl-amine). The precursor of the series under investigation is furfuryl-amine in which either one or both available hydrogens on the nitrogen are substituted. Fujii reported that furfur-ethyl-amine caused constriction of blood vessels by a direct action upon the smooth muscle.

40|$|When {{organizations}} that have survived traumatic reversals – for example, product failures, ethical scandals or market disruption – attempt turnarounds, they usually seek a fresh start, adopting a new strategy and installing new leadership. But if this new initiative doesn’t work and the firms continue to suffer from chronic under performance, the cause could be “transgenerational response,” a potentially crippling long-term condition stemming from the trauma {{that occurred in the}} past (see the cases of AIG and Yahoo). Transgenerational response syndrome is well known in medical and biological research. The term describes a severe environmental condition that creates a negative adaptive response in an organism. The response is transmitted to future generations and adversely influences their development and health. Healthcare research has identified, for example, adverse transgenerational effects of inadequate maternal nutrition, which harms the development and health of future generations. Even traumatic experiences can cause both physical and psychological consequences for several generations of descendants of survivors. One of the most illuminating studies into transgenerational response was an examination of the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in babies of mothers exposed during pregnancy to the World Trade Center attack in 2001. [1] The study concluded that the effects of maternal PTSD, {{as a result of this}} catastrophic event, were passed on to their babies.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effect of early {{clinical}} and demographic factors on occupational outcome, return to work or awarded permanent disability pension in young patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Design: Longitudinal cohort study. Intervention: A written self-management programme including a description of active coping strategies for daily life was provided. Setting, participants: Patients with CFS after mononucleosis were evaluated at Department of Neurology, Haukeland University Hospital during 1996 – 2006 (contact 1). In 2009 self-report questionnaires were sent to all patients (contact 2). Primary and secondary outcome measures: Primary measure was employment status at contact 2. Secondary measures included clinical symptoms, and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) scores on both contacts, and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) at contact 2. Results: Of 111 patients at contact 1, 92 (83 %) patients returned the questionnaire at contact 2. Mean disease duration at contact 1 was 4. 7 years and at contact 2 11. 4 years. At contact 1, 9 (10 %) were part-time or fulltime employed. At contact 2, 49 (55 %) were part-time or full-time employed. Logical regression analysis showed that FSS≥ 5 at contact 2 was associated with depression, arthralgia and long disease duration (all at contact 1).

6000|$|It {{should be}} {{considered}} also, that grave moral consequences depend upon the habitual pleasure or pain which daily lessons produce. No one can compare the faces and manners of two boys--the one made happy by mastering interesting subjects, and the other made miserable by disgust with his studies, by consequent inability, by cold looks, by threats, by punishment--without seeing that the disposition of the one is being benefited {{and that of the}} other injured. Whoever has marked the effects of success and failure upon the mind, {{and the power of the}} mind over the body, will see that in the one case both temper and health are favourably affected, while in the other there is danger of permanent moroseness, or permanent timidity, and even of <b>permanent</b> constitutional <b>depression.</b> There remains yet another indirect result of no small moment. The relationship between teachers and their pupils is, other things equal, rendered friendly and influential, or antagonistic and powerless, according as the system of culture produces happiness or misery. Human beings are at the mercy of their associated ideas. A daily minister of pain cannot fail to be regarded with secret dislike; and if he causes no emotions but painful ones, will inevitably be hated. Conversely, he who constantly aids children to their ends, hourly provides them with the satisfactions of conquest, hourly encourages them through their difficulties and sympathises in their successes, will be liked; nay, if his behaviour is consistent throughout, must be loved. And when we remember how efficient and benign is the control of a master who is felt to be a friend, when compared with the control of one who is looked upon with aversion, or at best indifference, we may infer that the indirect advantages of conducting education on the happiness principle do not fall far short of the direct ones. To all who question the possibility of acting out the system here advocated, we reply as before, that not only does theory point to it, but experience commends it. To the many verdicts of distinguished teachers who since Pestalozzi's time have testified this, may be here added that of Professor Pillans, who asserts that [...] "where young people are taught as they ought to be, they are quite as happy in school as at play, seldom less delighted, nay, often more, with the well-directed exercise of their mental energies than with that of their muscular powers." ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Pervasive refusal {{syndrome}} (PRS) {{is a rare}} but severe condition, characterised {{by social}} withdrawal and a pervasive active refusal in terms of eating, mobilisation, speech and personal hygiene. PRS has been proposed as a new diagnostic entity in child and adolescent psychiatry, although the diagnostic criteria are debated. In the past 10 {{years there has been}} an increase in PRS symptoms among asylum-seeking children and adolescents in Sweden. Here, we describe five cases of PRS among asylum-seeking children and adolescents. METHOD: Three females and 2 males, 7 - 17 years of age with the clinical picture of PRS, treated as inpatients at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Malmö, Sweden, 2002 - 2010, were analysed {{on the basis of their}} medical records. Subjects were diagnosed using previously suggested criteria for PRS. At follow-up, a semi-structured interview focusing on the inpatient stay and current status was performed. The subjects were assessed with Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and self-rating questionnaires regarding depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). RESULTS: The pattern of refusal varied among the five subjects. All subjects originated from former Soviet republics, indicating a possible cultural factor. Mean period of inpatient treatment was 5 months. All subjects received intense nursing and were treated with nasogastric tube feeding. Parents were involved and were given support and instructions. All subjects gradually improved after receiving <b>permanent</b> residency permits. <b>Depression</b> and PTSD were co-morbid states.

40|$|The {{advances}} in technology, life support and transport procedures {{have increased the}} survival for victims of traumatic accidents. However, many survivors have been left with residual psychological and physical deficits. This study attempted to capture the lived experience of trauma by examining the social environment in which people confronted life threatening injuries and how that event became meaningful for them. ^ A prospective study design documented {{the process of change}} that occurred to thirty trauma victims over fourteen months. The design was intended to uncover the physical and emotional changes these victims sustained and to identify factors that facilitated or impeded recovery. An anthropological approach let the informants speak for themselves, and examined their recovery in the hospital, rehabilitation facility, and home. ^ Data were collected by limited participant-observation and intensive in-depth interviewing at several points during the recovery process. Trauma victims, their families, physicians, and nurses were participants in the data collection. ^ Coding categories that were abstractions of the themes and topics emerging from the ethnographic materials were developed. The coding process extended from the specific statements in the interviews, to a more abstract level, and back to specifics to determine if the various parts continued to weave a congruent whole. Returning to the informants to confirm new insights helped to increase validity. Three qualitative researchers were given four interviews to code, and interrater reliability was calculated to be. 89. ^ At the end of the fourteen months, thirteen of thirty informants did not describe themselves as recovered. Characteristics that this group shared were <b>depression,</b> <b>permanent</b> physical injury, and disfiguring scars. Pre-existing personality and social support did not {{have a significant effect on}} recovery. The seventeen who were recovered had shorter hospital stays, full physical recovery, and had returned to work. The general typology of responses that was common for all the informants involved three stages of recovery; crisis, healing, and recovery. Themes identified from the ethnographic data that have ramifications for intervention studies include a sense of abandonment after discharge, insensitive pain management, and prolonged grief reaction. ...|$|R

M. 160 S. : 64 Abbn., 24 Tab., 3 gezeichnete Tafeln, 4 mikroskopische Tafeln Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin Institut für Biologie AG Ökologie Die Untersuchungen konzentrierten sich auf das Plankton von Söllen der Jungmorä nenlandschaft Nordostdeutschlands. Ziel war es, die {{qualitative}} und quantitative Phyto- und Zooplanktonstruktur verschiedener Sölle unter dem Gesichtspunkt der nterschiedlichen Landnutzung, des Wasserhaushaltes und des Stoffeintrages in zwei Untersuchungsgebieten zu erfassen, mit einem weitgehend ursprünglichen Forstsoll zu vergleichen und daraus Schlußfolgerungen für den Erhalt und den Schutz dieser Kleingewässer abzuleiten. Es wurden sieben repräsentative Sölle monatlich über drei Vegetationsperioden (1994 - 1997) untersucht. Neben dem Artenspektrum und dem Abun danzwechsel des Phyto- und Zooplanktons erfolgte eine Erfassung des Chlorophyll a -Gehaltes der Mikroalgenzellen, der hydrochemischen und physikalischen Grundparameter und der Pegelstände des Sollwassers. Trotz der großen Individualität der Untersuchungsgewässer konnten aus den Erg ebnissen die Sölle in drei Gruppen statistisch signifikant zusammengefaßt werden. Für deren Abgrenzung sind die Nährstoffverhältnisse (N oder P-Überschüsse, Nitrifikationsgrad), die Sauerstoffsättigungswerte und das Artenspektrum des Phyto- und Zooplanktons bedeutsam. Hohe Leitfähigkeit des Wassers besonders in den Söllen des Gebietes um Lietzen-Döbberin wird durch hohe Sulfat- und Chloridgehalte bedingt. Im Vergleich zu den Seen sind die Chlorophyll a -Konzentrationen als Biomasseäquivalent für die Mikroalgen in Relation zu den Phosphatgehalten auffallend gering. Aus den Ergebnissen lassen sich Maßnahmen zur Erhaltung und dem Schutz der Sölle ableiten. Es wird die konsequente Verminderung der externen Nährstoffeinträge durch die Schaffung und/ oder Pflege von Pufferzonen sowie gegebenenfalls die Umwidmung des Einzugsgebietes in Dauergrünland empfohlen. Weitere Maßnahmen, die auf die Reduzierung der internen Nährstoffreserven zielen, sind erst nach zusätzlichen Untersuchungen insbesondere zum Phosphorbindungsvermögen der Sedimente für die Sölle ableitbar. Limnological {{characterization of}} selected ponded depressions {{of the north}} German young moraine site {{as a basis for}} conservation* *) sponsored by the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt and the FAZIT-Stiftung, Frankfurt a. M. 160 S. : 64 Abbn., 24 Tab., 3 graphic Tables, 4 microscope tables Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin Institut für Biologie AG Ökologie The main geographical feature of the ground and terminal moraines of northern Germany are the numerous small depressions, many of which are water-filled. They represent a typical geographical element of this region and in the German language are usually referred to as "Sölle" (Singular = "Soll"). These small bodies of water were created either glacially through the melting of dead-ice pieces (natural depressions or dead-ice depressions) or later (circa 12 th or 13 th century) {{in the course of the}} clearing of large tracts of forested land through the partial and <b>permanent</b> damming of <b>depressions</b> (pseudo depressions). The study concentrated on the plankton levels of ponded depressions in the recent moraines of northern Germany. The goal of the study was to record the qualitative and quantitative phytoplankton and zooplankton make-up of several different ponded depressions with consideration of the various land uses, management of water, and introduction of nutrients in two research areas and to compare these findings with a mostly unaltered forested ponded depression (ponded depression in a forested area) for the purpose of deriving conclusions about the preservation and protection of these small water ways. Seven representative ponded depressions were examined monthly over the span of three vegetation periods (1994 - 1997). In addition to the variety of vegetational species and the variation in amounts of phytoplankton and zooplankton, data about the amount of chlorophyll a in the micro algae cells, the hydro-chemical and physical ground parameters, and the water level of the ponds was recorded. In spite of the considerable uniqueness of each of the ponds under examination, the results of the study allowed for the classification of the ponded depressions into three statistically significant groupings. The proportions of nutrients (a surplus of N or P or the level of nitrification), the oxygen saturation values, and the vegetational spectrum of phytoplankton and zooplankton proved meaningful for the differentiation of the groupings. High conductivity of the water, especially in the ponds in the area around Lietzen-Döbberin, is caused by high levels of sulfate and chloride. In comparison to lakes, the concen trations of Chlorophyll a as a biomass equivalent for the micro algae are noticeably smaller in relation to the phosphate levels. The results of the research suggest measures for the preservation and protection of the ponded depressions. The intentional reduction of external nutrients through the creation of and/or care for buffer zones and, if necessary, the redesignation of areas zoned for development into permanent nature conservation zones is recommended. Further preservation measures, aimed at reducing the reserves of internal nutrients, will only be deduced after further study of the ponded depressions, especially in relation to the ability of the sediment to absorb phosphors...|$|R
