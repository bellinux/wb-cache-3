An hour into the flight (after onboard recording cameras had run out of film), a leak caused the right-hand propeller controls to lose their effectiveness and the rear propeller subsequently reversed its pitch, disrupting that engine's thrust, which caused the aircraft to yaw hard to the right. The USAAF account said that, [...] "It appeared that loss of hydraulic fluid caused failure of the pitch change mechanism of right rear propeller. Mr. Hughes maintained full power of right engine and reduced that of left engine instead of trying to fly with right <b>propeller</b> <b>windmilling</b> without power.

40|$|The XF- 12 {{airplane}} is {{a high-performance}} photo-reconnaissance aircraft {{designed for the}} Army Air Forces by the Republic Aviation Corporation. An investigation of a 1 / 8. 33 - scale powered model {{was made in the}} Langley l 9 -foot pressure tunnel to obtain information relative to the aerodynamic design of the airplane. The model was tested with and without the original vertical tail. and with two revised tails. For the revised tail no. 1, the span of the original vertical. tail was increased about 15 percent and the portion of the vertical tail between the stabilizer and fuselage behind the rudder hinge line was allowed to deflect simultaneously with the main rudder. Revision no. 2 incorporated the increased span, but the lower rudder was locked in the neutral position. For all the tail arrangements investigated it was indicated that the airplane will possess positive effective dihedral and will be directionally stable regardless of flap or power condition. The rudder effectiveness is greater for the revised tails than for the original tail, but this is offset by the increase in directional stability caused by the revised tail. All the rudder arrangements appear inadequate in trimming out the resultant yawing moments at zero yaw in a take - off condition with the left-hand outboard <b>propeller</b> <b>windmilling</b> and the remaining engines developing take-off power...|$|E

Saras is powered by twin turbo-prop engines and the five bladed propeller is positioned in a pusher configuration. In this context, this work is carried out to obtain computational estimates of thrust produced and power absorbed by the propeller in their un-installed condition. A validation case based on NACA report 640 along with the Saras-PT 1 :Hartzell propeller and Saras-PT 2 :MT propeller were analysed for different blade pitch angle () 3) settings and advance ratios (J) in an automated UNIX/GNU environment using CFD-ACE+ softwares. It was noticed that the CFD analyses resulted in results that were ' 7 [...] 1 ° of 0 lower than the experimental data for the validation case, while a difference of;z:~ 2 ° - 50 was noted for the Hartzell and MT propellers. Also, the blade twisting moment and <b>propeller</b> <b>windmilling</b> torque purely by aerodynamics is estimated for the Saras-PT 2 :MT propeller and the windmilling dynamics are obtained by numerical integration from the computed aerodynamic torques.

50|$|Canadian {{accident}} {{investigators found}} that a bevel gear in the oil pump drive had failed, shutting off lubrication to the propeller. This caused the propeller to decouple from the engine, allowing it to windmill at high speed. Moreover, during the emergency descent, the pilots had allowed the aircraft's airspeed to increase {{too close to the}} maximum allowable. This put significant strain on the <b>windmilling</b> <b>propeller</b> and in all probability caused it to fail in flight.

The effects on the model's spin-recovery characteristics of removing the lower vertical tail, removing the gun pods, and fixing the rudders at neutral were also investigated briefly. The investigation included determination of the size parachute required for emergency recovery from demonstration spins. The tumbling tendencies of the model were also investigated. Brief static force tests were made to determine the aerodynamic characteristics in pitch at high angles of attack. The investigation indicated that the spin and recovery characteristics of the airplane with <b>propeller</b> <b>windmilling</b> will be satisfactory for all loading conditions if recovery is attempted by full rudder reversal accompanied by simultaneous movement of the stick laterally to full with the spin (stick right in a right spin) and longitudinally to neutral. Inverted spins should be satisfactorily terminated by fully reversing the rudder followed immediately by moving the stick laterally towards the forward rudder pedal and longitudinally to neutral. Removal of the gun pods or fixing the rudders at neutral will not adversely affect the airplane's spin-recovery characteristics, but removal of the lower vertical tail will result in unsatisfactory spin-recovery characteristics. The model-test results showed that a 13. 3 -foot wing-tip conventional parachute (drag coefficient approximately 0. 7) should be effective as an emergency spin-recovery device during demonstration spins of the airplane. It was indicated that the airplane should not tumble and that no unusual longitudinal-trim characteristics should be obtained for the center-of-gravity positions investigated...|$|E

40|$|A {{flight test}} has been {{conducted}} to determine the longitudinal stability and control characteristics of a 0. 133 -scale model of the Consolidated Vultee XFY- 1 airplane with <b>windmilling</b> <b>propellers</b> for the Mach number range between 0. 70 and 1. 13. The variation of lift-curve slope C(sub L(sub alpha) with Mach number was gradual with a maximum value of 0. 074 occurring at a Mach number of 0. 97. Propellers had little effect upon the values of lift-curve slope or the linearity of lift coefficient with angle of attack. At lift coefficients between approximately 0. 25 and 0. 45 with an elevon angle of approximately -l 0 deg, there was a region of neutral longitudinal stability at Mach numbers below 0. 93 introduced {{by the addition of}} <b>windmilling</b> <b>propellers.</b> Below a lift coefficient of 0. 10 and above a lift coefficient of 0. 45, the model was longitudinally stable throughout the Mach number range of the test. There was a forward shift in the aerodynamic center of about 3 -percent mean aerodynamic chord introduced by the addition of propellers. The aerodynamic center as determined at low lift moved gradually from a value of 28. 5 -percent mean aerodynamic chord at a Mach number of 0. 75 to a value of 47 -percent mean aerodynamic chord at a Mach number of 1. 10. There was an abrupt decrease in pitch damping between Mach numbers of 0. 88 and 0. 99 followed by a rapid increase in damping to a Mach number of 1. 06. The propellers had little effect upon the pitch damping characteristics. The transonic trim change was a large pitching-down tendency with and without <b>windmilling</b> <b>propellers.</b> The elevons were effective pitch controls throughout the speed range; however, their effectiveness was reduced about 50 percent at supersonic speeds.

The <b>windmilling</b> <b>propeller</b> made the engine continue to spin without delivering any power as the aircraft descended. It was important to leave the ignition on to allow the spark plugs to continue to spark and keep them from oiling up, so that the engine could (if all went well) be restarted simply by re-opening the fuel valve.

40|$|The {{theory to}} predict the {{performance}} and loads on rotors (<b>propellers,</b> screws, <b>windmills)</b> {{has a history of}} more than a century. Apart from modern computational fluid dynamics and vortex panel models taking the true blade geometry into account, most other models proceed from an infinitely thin actuator disc or line. These models assume an externally defined force field distributed at the disc or line, representing the loads on the real rotor. Given this force field, the flow is solved by momentum balances or by the equations of motion. The use of external force fields was discussed in textbooks of {{the first decades of the}} 20 th century, but has received little attention since then. This paper investigates the higher-order effect of adding thickness to the actuator disc or changing the actuator line to a blade with cross-sectional dimensions. For the generation of a Rankine vortex by a force field acting on an actuator disc with thickness, an exact solution has been found in which not only the thrust and torque determine the flow, but also a radial force. This force is conservative, in contrast to the other force components. For rotor blades, a conservative normal and radial force acting on the chordwise bound vorticity is present. This explains the experimentally observed inboard motion of the tip vortex of model wind turbine rotors before the wake induction field drives it outboard. Simulations by computational fluid mechanics and a vortex panel code reproduce the inboard motion, but an actuator line analysis, in which the chordwise vorticity is absent, does not. The conservative load is only 1 – 2...|$|R
