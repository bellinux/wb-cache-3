50|$|In {{underground}} {{rapid transit}} systems, the <b>piston</b> <b>effect</b> contributes to ventilation {{and in some}} cases provides enough air movement to make mechanical ventilation unnecessary. At wider stations with multiple tracks, air quality remains the same and can even improve when mechanical ventilation is disabled.

30|$|The {{effects of}} {{variation}} of the Alfven-Mach number, the initial density variation index and {{the ratio of the}} specific heat of the gas on the shock strength and flow variables are investigated. It is found that the assumption of zero temperature gradient brings a profound change in the distribution of density, non-dimensional azimuthal and axial components of vorticity vectors as compared to those of the adiabatic case. A comparison between the obtained solutions and the existing solutions of Rao and Ramana (1976) is made in non-magnetic case. Also, a comparison between the solutions in the case of isothermal and adiabatic flows is made. Further, it is shown that the consideration of zero temperature gradient and an increase in the strength of ambient magnetic field, the initial density variation index or adiabatic exponent of the gas decrease the shock strength and widen the disturbed region between the shock and the <b>piston.</b> <b>Effects</b> of gravitation and viscosity are not taken into account.|$|R

The difference in the two forces would be proportional to the difference in area of the two <b>pistons.</b> In <b>effect</b> the cylinders act {{in a similar way}} that a lever is used to increase the force exerted.

This paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} squeeze motion to elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) in piston pin of air compressor with non-Newtonian lubricants based on a Carreau viscosity model.

50|$|The {{strength}} of this imbalance is determined by 1. Reciprocating mass, 2. Ratio of connecting rod length to stroke, and 3. Acceleration of piston movement. So small displacement engines with light <b>pistons</b> show little <b>effect,</b> and racing engines use long connecting rods. However, the effect grows exponentially with crankshaft rotational speed. See crossplane article for unusual inline-four configurations.|$|R
40|$|With {{the future}} growing size of telescopes, new, high-resolution, {{affordable}} wavefront corrector technology with low power dissipation is needed. A new adaptive deformable mirror concept is presented, to meet such requirements. The adaptive mirror {{consists of a}} thin (30 - 50 µm), highly reflective, deformable membrane. An actuator grid with thousands of actuators is designed which push and pull at the membrane 2 ̆ 2 s surface, free from pinning and <b>piston</b> <b>effects.</b> The membrane and the actuator grid are supported by an optimized light and stiff honeycomb sandwich structure. This mechanically stable and thermally insensitive support structure provides a stiff reference plane for the actuators. The design is extendable up to several hundreds of mm's. Low-voltage electro-magnetic actuators have been designed. These highly linear actuators can provide a stroke of 15 micrometers. The design allows for a stroke difference between adjacent actuators larger than 1 micron. The actuator grid has a layer-based design; these layers extend over a large numbers of actuators. The current actuator design allows for actuator pitches of 3 mm or more. Actuation is free from play, friction and mechanical hysteresis and therefore has a high positioning resolution and is highly repeatable. The lowest mechanical resonance frequency is {{in the range of}} kHz so a high control bandwidth can be achieved. The power dissipation in the actuator grid is in the order of milliwatts per actuator. Because of this low power dissipation active cooling is not required. A first prototype is currently being developed. Prototypes will be developed with increasing number of actuators...|$|R

50|$|The <b>piston</b> <b>effect</b> is very {{pronounced}} in railway tunnels, because the {{cross sectional area}} of train is large and almost completely fills the whole tunnel cross section. The wind felt by the passengers on underground train station platforms (that do not have platform screen doors installed) when a train is approaching is air flow from the <b>piston</b> <b>effect.</b> The effect is less {{pronounced in}} road vehicle tunnel, as the cross-sectional area of vehicle is small compared to the total cross-sectional area of the tunnel. Single track tunnels experience the maximum effect but clearance between rolling stock and the tunnel {{as well as the}} shape of the front of the train affect its strength.|$|E
50|$|Air flow {{caused by}} the <b>piston</b> <b>effect</b> can exert large forces on the {{installations}} inside the tunnel and so these installations have to be carefully designed and installed properly.

40|$|Identifying blast-wave shocks, {{which can}} arise during CME formation, {{is a much}} more complex problem. The {{difference}} from piston shocks is that a blast-wave shock originates from the explosions that frequently accompany CME formation, and further propagates freely without any CME <b>piston</b> <b>effects.</b> The bow shock of Earth is a piston shock. Behind the bow shock front there is a flow of the modified solar wind plasma: transition layer, which also carries the modified magnetic field of solar wind. Velocity and density of plasma as well as parameters of magnetic field of this current can be estimated if the form of the bow shock front and of magnetopause are considered to be known. In this paper we assumed them to be paraboloids of rotation. In this paper we have determined potential distribution along magnetopause from the balance condition of substance coming into transition layer from the solar wind on one side and leaving through the gap between magnetosphere and the bow shock front and through magnetopause on another. To a first approximation this distribution differs from potential distribution at the BS front only in a constant multiplier. We used the established potential distribution as a boundary condition while solving the problem on potential distribution in the magnetosphere. The first solution harmonic turned out to coincide in the form with the boundary condition on magnetopause. We have constructed the full solution for electric field in the magnetosphere having limited ourselves to the first harmonic and corotation field. We have obtained necessary equations to model processes in the region of bow shock. Comment: 17 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
