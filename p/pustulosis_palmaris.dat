50|$|Localized {{pustular}} psoriasis presents as {{two distinct}} conditions {{that must be}} considered separate from generalized psoriasis, and without systemic symptoms, these two distinct varieties being <b>pustulosis</b> <b>palmaris</b> et plantaris and acrodermatitis continua.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pustulosis</b> <b>palmaris</b> et plantaris (also {{known as}} pustulosis of palms and soles, palmoplantar pustulosis, {{persistent}} palmoplantar pustulosis, pustular psoriasis of the Barber type, and pustular psoriasis of the extremities) is a chronic recurrent pustular dermatosis (that is, a pustulosis or pustular psoriasis) localized on the palms and soles only, characterized histologically by intraepidermal pustules filled with neutrophils. It can occur {{as part of}} the SAPHO syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Pustular {{psoriasis}} can be localized, commonly to {{the hands}} and feet (palmoplantar pustulosis), or generalized with widespread patches occurring randomly on {{any part of the}} body. Acrodermatitis continua is a form of localized psoriasis limited to the fingers and toes that may spread to {{the hands and}} feet. <b>Pustulosis</b> <b>palmaris</b> et plantaris is another form of localized pustular psoriasis similar to acrodermatitis continua with pustules erupting from red, tender, scaly skin found on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.|$|E
40|$|Arthro-osteitis at the {{anterior}} chest wall {{was found in}} 12 (9 · 4 %) out of 128 consecutive patients with <b>pustulosis</b> <b>palmaris</b> et plantaris. This finding indicates that the concomitance of arthro-osteitis with PPP is not incidental but is based on some common aetiological factor. We propose a term `pustulotic arthro-osteitis' for this condition...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} 3 {{children with}} <b>pustulosis</b> <b>palmaris</b> et plantaris associated with chronic recurrent (multifocal) osteomyelitis, {{located in the}} clavicle in 2 patients, and in the distal fibula {{as well as in}} several metatarsals in the third. The first 2 children also developed inflammatory sacroiliitis, one with chronic peripheral polyarthritis. These 3 cases represent the arthrosteitis and chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis syndrome associated with palmoplantar pustulosis...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} case of a 64 -year-old woman who has {{suffered}} from <b>pustulosis</b> <b>palmaris</b> et plantaris for 10 years. At the first examination, many erythematous lesions with purpura, blood crusts, and blisters were present in the lower legs and dorsum of the feet. Painful swelling in the sternal region and dorsal pain were also noted. Elevation of the CRP and myogenic enzyme levels, and liver and renal dysfunctions were noted on blood testing. Histopathologically, leukocytoclastic vasculitis was noted in small blood vessels in the whole dermal layers, and deposition of IgM and C 3 in the vascular wall was detected by the direct immunofluorescence techniques. Based on these findings, cutaneous small vessel vasculitis was diagnosed. Because the patient complained of a toothache during the clinical course, an X-ray examination was performed. On pantomography, a radicular cyst and apical periodontitis were noted. The tooth symptoms changed with exacerbation and remission of the skin symptoms. These findings indicate that odontogenic infection is very likely to be a cause of cutaneous small vessel vasculitis {{in a manner similar to}} <b>pustulosis</b> <b>palmaris</b> et plantaris...|$|E
40|$|In a {{prospective}} open study, seven patients with persistent <b>pustulosis</b> <b>palmaris</b> et plantaris {{were treated with}} oral Cyclosporin A (CsA). Clinical efficacy was assessed on a semi-quantitative 0 - 4 point scale for erythema, desquamation, induration and pustulation. CsA controlled skin lesions in doses ranging from 1. 1 to 6. 1 mg/kg body weight/day. Clinical side effects included renal impairment, nausea and tiredness. Rapid recurrence of the skin lesions was observed on withdrawal or insufficient treatment with the dru...|$|E
40|$|Clinically it is {{sometimes}} difficult to differentiate the various hyperkeratosis of palms and soles like psoriasis of palms and soles, <b>pustulosis</b> <b>palmaris</b> et plantaris, hyperkeratotic tinea and hyperkeratotic eczema. To differentiate amongst these conditions {{we have to take}} the help of histopathology. Here we are presenting the data of 292 cases of hyperkeratosis of palms &#x 0026;soles examined histologically by doing Haematoxylin and Eosin staining for the typical changes of the above mentioned conditions and PAS for the demonstration of the fungus in stratum corneum in cases of hyperkeratotic tinea...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that <b>pustulosis</b> <b>palmaris</b> et plantaris and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are two distinct diseases, and that the associated dermatoses are therefore also distinct diseases. METHODS: We prospectively performed clinical, radiological, biological, and bone scan investigations in 23 outpatients with pustolotic arthritis and 23 outpatients with PsA, matched by gender, age (+/- one year) and duration of arthritis (+/- two years). RESULTS: The anterior chest wall, especially the sternocostoclavicular joints, was more frequently involved in pustulotic arthritis than in PsA, both clinically (82 % v 43 %; p < 0. 001) and radiologically (47 % v 17 %; p < 0. 05). Sternocostoclavicular joints generally presented with erosive lesions in PsA, and with large ossifications in pustulotic arthritis. Peripheral joint involvement was mono- or oligoarticular, affecting proximal joints, in pustulotic arthritis (74 % v 21 %; p < 0. 01), and polyarticular, involving small distal joints, in PsA (60 % v 0 %; p < 10 (- 4)), in which condition it was also more often erosive (43 % v 8 %; p < 0. 01). The frequency of sacroiliitis and of spine involvement was similar in pustulotic arthritis and PsA. Biology and bone scan did not help distinguish between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Pustulotic arthritis and PsA are clinically and radiologically different, therefore <b>pustulosis</b> <b>palmaris</b> et plantaris and psoriasis are most probably distinct dermatological diseases...|$|E
40|$|Typical lesions of {{hyperkeratosis}} of {{palms and}} soles do not create any problem but when slight variation is there it becomes difficult to diagnose and {{that changes the}} line of treatment. For that we have studied 300 fresh cases of hyperkeratosis of palms and soles which included 110 cases of hyperkeratotic eczema. 42 cases of hyperkeratotic tinea, 64 cases of psoriasis of palms and soles and 84 cases of <b>pustulosis</b> <b>palmaris</b> et plantaris (PPP). To reach the final diagnosis alongwith the detailed history, general physical examination and routine investigations, help was taken of special investigations like pus for culture and sensitivity, KOH smear examination of skin scrapings and nail cutting and culture on Sabouraud&#x 2032;s dextrose agar medium...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pustulosis</b> <b>palmaris</b> et plantaris or palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a {{refractory}} pustular eruption on {{the palms}} and soles with unknown etiology. Numerous eccrine sweat pores {{exist on the}} palms and soles, suggesting the involvement of eccrine sweating in the pathogenesis of PPP. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, however, no definite abnormality in sweating has been documented in PPP. Accordingly, we analyzed the eccrine sweat duct involvement in the mechanism of vesicle formation in PPP. Dermatoscopy showed that PPP vesicles are located {{on the top of the}} ridges but not in the furrows. The sweat secretion in the lesional area was much lower than that in the nonlesional area, with or without pain stimulation to induce sweating. Immunostaining of horizontal sections of the lesions using antibodies against gross cystic disease fluid protein- 15 (GCDFP- 15) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) showed that these markers were localized in the cells lining the intraepidermal vesicles. Although the sweat antimicrobial peptides, dermcidin and human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide 18 (hCAP- 18) /LL- 37, were detected in the fluid of the vesicles/pustules, neither dermcidin nor hCAP- 18 /LL- 37 were overexpressed by neighboring keratinocytes. These findings suggest that the acrosyringium may be involved as the main site of the vesicle formation in the pathomechanism of PPP...|$|E
40|$|Studies on the anti-keratin {{intermediate}} filament autoantibodies (anti-KIF-Abs) in sera from psoriasis (Pso) {{patients were}} performed by immunoblotting and {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA). According to their reactivities against keratin subunits (50, 56. 5, 58, and 63 - 68 kd), sera were divided into four groups. However, {{no significant differences in}} these reactive patterns were found between healthy volunteers and Pso patients. In the second experiment, anti-KIF-Abs in sera from Pso patients, <b>pustulosis</b> <b>palmaris</b> et plantaris (PPP) patients, atopic dermatitis (AD) patients, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, and healthy volunteers were determined by ELISA, using as substrate keratins purified from normal human stratum corneum and 48 - and 50 -kd keratins purified from psoriatic stratum corneum. The serum titers of anti-KIF-Abs against 48 - and 50 -kd keratins in Pso patients were significantly higher than those in PPP patients, AD patients, SLE patients, or healthy volunteers. The elevated titers of anti-KIF-Abs against the 48 - and 50 -kd keratins in sera of Pso patients showed a significant decrease with improvement of psoriatic lesions. The above results suggest that anti-KIF-Abs against 48 - and 50 -kd keratins in sera of Pso patients have some relevance to the severity of the disease and {{can be used as a}} marker for the evaluation of the disease activity of psoriasis...|$|E
40|$|Dental metal {{allergy and}} dental focal {{infection}} are possible causes of dermatological diseases, {{but have been}} the subjects of few reports to date. We have been treating such patients in our special clinic for more than 20 years. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate the mouths of patients visiting our dental hospital over an 8 -year period, with the aim of clarifying whether dental metal allergy and/or dental focal infection affects their dermatologic conditions. We surveyed all clinical records of the 185 patients who visited Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital with chief complaints of dental metal allergy since 2002. Diagnostics of skin diseases, periodontal records, periapical lesions, dental caries, dental metal series patch test results and Electron Probed Micro-Analysis (EPMA) data were investigated. Ninety-two (49 %) patients were suffering from <b>pustulosis</b> <b>palmaris</b> et plantaris and 20 (11 %) patients had lichen planus. Eighty-two (49 %) patients showed positive reactions on patch testing. Based on the result of patch tests, Ni showed the highest positivity rate (62 %, 51 patients), but on EPMA, the number of patients with Ni as an allergen was 14 (27 %). On the other hand, more than 98 % of patients who showed positive reactions on patch test to Pd and Au had these metals in their dental prostheses. In addition, 112 (60 %) patients showed the possibility of dental focal infection...|$|E
40|$|L-selectin is a {{leucocyte}} {{adhesion molecule}} involved in leucocyte interactions with vascular endothelial cells. Following leucocyte activation L-selectin is endoproteolytically {{released from the}} cell surface. To assess whether psoriasis vulgaris results in systemic leucocyte activation, we examined expression levels of L-selectin on subsets of peripheral blood leucocytes from patients with psoriasis (n = 25) and normal control subjects. Serum levels of soluble L-selectin were quantified by ELISA in patients with psoriasis (n = 75), <b>pustulosis</b> <b>palmaris</b> et plantaris, and contact dermatitis, as well as normal control subjects. Psoriasis severity was evaluated by psoriasis area and severity index (PASI). L-selectin expression levels on CD 4 + T cells, B cells, monocytes, and neutrophils from patients with severe-type psoriasis (PASI ≥ 15) was significantly decreased compared with leucocytes from normal control subjects. Furthermore, L-selectin expression on CD 4 + T cells showed good inverse correlation with PASI scores. Monocyte L-selectin expression was restored when the skin lesions of psoriasis were remitted. The frequencies of L-selectin+ CD 4 + T cells or L-selectin+ CD 8 + T cells from patients with psoriasis were almost normal. Serum L-selectin levels in patients with severe-type psoriasis {{were significantly higher than}} those in normal control subjects. These results suggest that subsets of leucocytes may be activated in psoriasis, and that L-selectin expression levels on some leucocyte subsets, especially CD 4 + T cells, tend to correlate with disease severity of psoriasis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pustulosis</b> <b>palmaris</b> et plantaris", or palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP), is {{a chronic}} {{pustular}} dermatitis characterized by intraepidermal palmoplantar pustules. Although early stage vesicles (preceding the pustular phase) {{formed in the}} acrosyringium contain the antimicrobial peptides cathelicidin (hCAP- 18 /LL- 37) and dermcidin, the details of hCAP- 18 /LL- 37 expression in such vesicles remain unclear. The principal aim {{of the present study}} was to clarify the manner of hCAP- 18 /LL- 37 expression in PPP vesicles and to determine whether this material contributed to subsequent inflammation of lesional skin. PPP vesicle fluid (PPP-VF) induced the expression of mRNAs encoding IL- 17 C, IL- 8, IL- 1 α, and IL- 1 β in living skin equivalents, but the level of only IL- 8 mRNA decreased significantly upon stimulation of PPP vesicle with depletion of endogenous hCAP- 18 /LL- 37 by affinity chromatography (dep-PPP-VF). Semi-quantitative dot-blot analysis revealed higher concentrations of hCAP- 18 /LL- 37 in PPP-VF compared to healthy sweat (2. 87 ± 0. 93 µM vs. 0. 09 ± 0. 09 µM). This concentration of hCAP- 18 /LL- 37 in PPP-VF could upregulate expression of IL- 17 C, IL- 8, IL- 1 α, and IL- 1 β at both the mRNA and protein levels. Recombinant hCAP- 18 was incubated with dep-PPP-VF. Proteinase 3, which converts hCAP- 18 to the active form (LL- 37), was present in PPP-VF. Histopathological and immunohistochemical examination revealed that early stage vesicles contained many mononuclear cells but no polymorphonuclear cells, and the mononuclear cells were CD 68 -positive. The epidermis surrounding the vesicle expresses monocyte chemotactic chemokine, CCL 2. In conclusion, PPP-VF contains the proteinase required for LL- 37 processing and also may directly upregulate IL- 8 in lesional keratinocytes, in turn contributing to the subsequent inflammation of PPP lesional skin...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pustulosis</b> <b>palmaris</b> et plantaris (PPP) is a tonsil-related disease; {{tonsillectomy}} {{is somewhat}} effective in treating the condition. However, the aetiological {{association between the}} tonsils and PPP {{has not yet been}} elucidated fully. Recently, some chemokines and chemokine receptors, including CC chemokine receptor (CCR) 4, CCR 6 and CX chemokine receptor (CXCR) 3, have been reported to play important roles in the development of psoriasis, a disease related closely to PPP. In this study, we found that CCR 6 expression on both tonsillar and peripheral blood T cells was up-regulated more intensively in PPP patients than in non-PPP patients (P < 0 · 001 for both), but CCR 4 and CXCR 3 expressions were not. In vitro stimulation with α-streptococcal antigen enhanced CCR 6 expression significantly on tonsillar T cells in PPP patients (P < 0 · 05), but this was not observed in non-PPP patients. The chemotactic response of tonsillar T cells to the CCR 6 ligand CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 20 was significantly higher in PPP patients than in non-PPP patients (P < 0 · 05). The percentage of CCR 6 -positive peripheral blood T cells decreased after tonsillectomy in PPP patients (P < 0 · 01); this decrease correlated with an improvement of skin lesions (P < 0 · 05, r = − 0 · 63). The numbers of CCR 6 -positive cells and the expression of CCL 20 were increased significantly in pathological lesions compared with non-pathological lesions in PPP skin (P < 0 · 01, P < 0 · 05 respectively). These results suggest that a novel immune response to α-streptococci may enhance CCR 6 expression on T cells in tonsils and that CCR 6 -positive T cells may move to peripheral blood circulation, resulting in recruitment to target skin lesions expressing CCL 20 in PPP patients. This {{may be one of the}} key roles in pathogenesis of the tonsil-related disease PPP...|$|E
