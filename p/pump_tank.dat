50|$|Activity in {{the formal}} botanical gardens peaked {{in the first half}} of the 1890s. A well was sunk in 1890 and a <b>pump,</b> <b>tank</b> and pipe {{reticulation}} installed. A second well was sunk at some later stage. In 1892 a gardener's cottage (removed in 1917) was erected on the reserve and occupied by Charles Watson, who held the position of caretaker/gardener from 1890 to 1902. By this period the formal botanical gardens had been enclosed with a paling fence and intensively developed with lawns, shrubs and garden beds. By early 1893, they were being referred to officially as Queen's Park and Gardens - later the name came to represent the whole of the reserve. In the 1890s, stone-lined paths, stone-pitched pools and stone-work foot bridges were built along a creek descending from the hills behind Cherry Tree Bay, flower gardens flourished, a bush house was erected (1893) and a wide range of trees and shrubs of both decorative and economic value were planted in the gardens. Shade and street trees in the Cook Monument Park, and in Cooktown's main street, Charlotte Street, were supplied from the botanic gardens.|$|E

A pre-engineered treatment process developed to counter these challenges {{results in a}} more consistent effluent quality.

40|$|Five {{different}} kinds of domestic-size renewable energy system configurations for very cold climate regions were investigated.

A reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) of about 28 % was achieved for this system compared to an equivalent conventional system.

40|$|The F-area pump {{tanks are}} used to {{transfer}} supernate, sludge, and other materials. In any transfer, the solution must stay well mixed without allowing particulate matter to settle out of the liquid and, thus, accumulate {{in the bottom of}} the <b>pump</b> <b>tank.</b> Recently, the pulse jet mixing in F-area <b>Pump</b> <b>Tank</b> 1 (FPT 1) has been decommissioned. An analysis of the liquid transfer through FPT 1 has been performed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods to assess whether or not the velocities throughout the tank will remain high enough to keep all particulate suspended using only transfer and recirculation pumps. The following paragraph is an abbreviated synopsis of the transfer procedure for FPT 1 [1, 2]. Prior to a transfer, FPT 1 begins to be filled with inhibited water through the inlet transfer line (TI). When the tank liquid level reaches 52. 5 inches above the absolute tank bottom, the recirculation pump (RI and RO) is activated. At a tank liquid level of 72. 5 inches above the absolute tank bottom, the outlet transfer line (TO) is activated to reduce the liquid level in FPT 1 and transfer inhibited water to H-area <b>Pump</b> <b>Tank</b> 7 (HPT 7). The liquid level is reduced down to 39. 5 inches, with an allowable range from 37. 5 to 41. 5 inches above the absolute tank bottom. HPT 7 goes through a similar procedure as FPT 1 until both have tank liquid levels of approximately 39. 5 inches above the absolute tank bottom. The transfer of inhibited water continues until a steady-state has been reached in both pump tanks. At this point, the supernate/sludge transfer begins with a minimum flow rate of 70 gpm and an average flow rate of 150 gpm. After the transfer is complete, the pump tanks (both FPT 1 and HPT 7) are pumped down to between 20. 5 and 22. 5 inches (above absolute bottom) and then flushed with 25, 000 gallons of inhibited water to remove any possible sludge heal. After the flushing, the pump tanks are emptied. Note that the tank liquid level is measured using diptubes. Figure 2. 1 provides a simplified sketch (not to scale) of FPT 1 during the steady-state transfer condition, which consists of two inlet flows that impact the liquid surface as plunging jets and two outlet flows drawn from near the bottom of the tank. During the transfer, the supernate level is held at 39. 5 inches above the absolute bottom of the tank [1, 2]. In addition, the FPT 1 can contain up to 16. 7 wt. % sludge particles within the supernate for a given transfer [2]. Test results from Tank 40 sludge Batch 3 [3] provide a typical range of particulate diameters between 0. 1 and 25 {micro}m, with approximately 20 vol. % of the sludge distribution consisting of particles less than 1 {micro}m in diameter. The purpose of this analysis is to estimate FPT 1 flow field during the steady-state transfer conditions to ensure that the tank remains mixed and that the velocities throughout the tank are sufficient to keep all sludge particulate suspended...|$|E
40|$|Various studies {{conducted}} {{to process the}} vast solar energy is abundant in the world, especially in Indonesia, which is a tropical country. Now this {{is the use of}} solar panels was developed as an alternative source of electrical energy generation. Researchers {{are looking for ways to}} utilize solar panels as a tool that can ease and useful for society as garden sprinklers work automatically by considering the soil moisture. This research aims to design an automatic garden sprinklers solar power refers to soil moisture. In the automatic garden sprinkler methods of solar power does is to design a place to put solar panels at a height of 2 meters above the ground at an angle of 300, the installation of sprinklers in the area of the plant so that the plant can pour water thoroughly, and installation of soil moisture sensor in the ground at a distance of 1 meter in hopes sensor can work in accordance with the value of soil moisture. How to observations made related to data capture voltage and current generated by solar panels, water discharge, variations in water bursts and the length of time to supply water pumps. The equipment used for these measurements, among others: luxmeter, used to measure the intensity of light. Ammeters, used to measure DC current. Multitester, used for measuring voltage and AC current. Stopwatch, used to calculate long time. The results showed that, the aquarium water pump can be switched on and off automatically without human intermediaries, it is because the soil moisture sensor, if the sensor shows values above 700 then the Arduino Uno will be channeled towards the output power relay circuit that turns on the water pump. Conversely, if the humidity sensor indicates a value less than 700 then the Arduino Uno does not provide power to the relay output so that the source DC circuit the battery can not be transmitted to the water pump. Testing the water pump without the use of solar panels capable of changing the water <b>pump</b> <b>tank</b> for 25 minutes. This is because it is full of energy supplied by the battery (batteries).

These wastes are made alkaline prior to transfer to the Tank Farm and are subject to acceptance based on their composition.

The Authorization Basis for the Tank Farm limits ammonia concentrations in canyon receipts to control flammability in pump tanks and waste tanks. However, during flushing of the canyon process vessel vent systems, the current limits pose significant operational restrictions. It was originally thought that the current limits based on data obtained by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), on a Hanford salt solution might be overly conservative with respect to salt solutions normally found in SRS Pump Tanks.

To properly assess the occupational exposure to sulfuric acid mists in modern facilities, approved National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Method 7903 and a cascade impactor were used for measuring the total sulfuric acid mist concentration and size-resolved sulfuric acid mist concentration, respectively. Sampling was conducted at eight phosphate fertilizer plants and two background sites in Florida and there were 24 sampling sites in these plants.
