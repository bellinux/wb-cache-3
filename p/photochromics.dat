50|$|Vivimed Labs Limited (NSE|VIVIMEDLAB, BSE532660) is an India-based global {{supplier}} of specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Headquartered in Hyderabad, India, Vivimed is {{a manufacturer of}} active pharmaceutical ingredients, active ingredients for home and personal care, hair dyes, imaging chemicals and <b>photochromics.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many {{inorganic}} substances also exhibit photochromic properties, often with much better resistance to fatigue than organic <b>photochromics.</b> In particular, silver chloride is extensively {{used in the}} manufacture of photochromic lenses. Other silver and zinc halides are also photochromic. Yttrium hydride is another inorganic material with photochromic properties.|$|E
50|$|The {{major areas}} of {{concentration}} are cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, Nutraceuticals, <b>Photochromics,</b> Natural Actives, colors and dyes. Since 2005, Vivimed has acquired James Robinson, UK and Har-Met International Inc.. The company currently has five manufacturing plants located in India along with R&D labs in the UK and India.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} qualities already mentioned, several other {{properties}} of <b>photochromics</b> {{are important for}} their use. These include quantum yield, fatigue resistance, photostationary state, and polarity and solubility. The quantum yield of the photochemical reaction determines {{the efficiency of the}} photochromic change with respect to the amount of light absorbed. The quantum yield of isomerization can be strongly dependent on conditions.In photochromic materials, fatigue refers to the loss of reversibility by processes such as photodegradation, photobleaching, photooxidation, and other side reactions. All <b>photochromics</b> suffer fatigue to some extent, and its rate is strongly dependent on the activating light and the conditions of the sample. Photochromic materials have two states, and their interconversion can be controlled using different wavelengths of light. Excitation with any given wavelength of light will result in a mixture of the two states at a particular ratio, called the photostationary state. In a perfect system, there would exist wavelengths {{that can be used to}} provide 1:0 and 0:1 ratios of the isomers, but in real systems this is not possible, since the active absorbance bands always overlap to some extent. In order to incorporate <b>photochromics</b> in working systems, they suffer the same issues as other dyes. They are often charged in one or more state, leading to very high polarity and possible large changes in polarity. They also often contain large conjugated systems that limit their solubility.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes, and {{particularly}} in the dye industry, the term [...] "irreversible photochromic" [...] is used to describe materials that undergo a permanent color change upon exposure to ultraviolet or visible light radiation. Because by definition <b>photochromics</b> are reversible, there is technically {{no such thing as an}} [...] "irreversible photochromic"—this is loose usage, and these compounds are better referred to as [...] "photochangable" [...] or [...] "photoreactive" [...] dyes.|$|E
50|$|If (as {{is always}} the case to some extent) the {{compounds}} A and B have different absorption spectra, then there may exist wavelengths of light where σa is high and σb is low. Irradiation at these wavelengths will provide photostationary states that contain mostly B. Likewise, wavelengths that give photostationary states of predominantly A may exist. This is particularly likely in compounds such as some <b>photochromics,</b> where A and B have entirely different absorption bands. Compounds that may be readily switched in this way find utility in devices such as molecular switches and optical data storage.|$|E
50|$|Vivimed was {{originally}} incorporated as M/s Emgi Pharmaceuticals & Chemicals Private Limited in 1988. The company {{was founded by}} Dr. V. Manohar Rao, who is today the Chairman of Vivimed Labs Limited. In 1997, the name changed to Vivimed Labs Limited. Vivimed was mainly into health care until its foray into the Home and Personal Care industry came {{with the advent of}} Triclosan. Rapid advances in the H&PC sector led to the company being listed with the BSE and the NSE in 2005. In 2007, VVS Pharma, a sister company which operated in the pharmaceutical and health-care sector merged with Vivimed Labs. The Specialty Chemicals Division was headed by Santosh Varalwar and the Health Care division was headed by Sandeep Varalwar. In 2008, Vivimed Labs acquired James Robinson, a 170-year-old manufacturer of hair dyes, fluorescents, solvent ink dye markers and <b>photochromics.</b> James Robinson continued to operate independently until its assimilation into the Vivimed Group in 2010. James Robinson was renamed Vivimed Labs Europe in April 2010. Dr. Richard Smith, the MD of James Robinson before and during its acquisition was appointed as the COO of Vivimed Labs Limited. Its manufacturing base was shifted from Germany to Hyderabad, India. The Kilo Lab for <b>Photochromics</b> and hair dye R&D is still located in Huddersfield, UK. The James Robinson brand names of Jarocol for its hair dyes and Reversacol for photochromic dyes have been retained.|$|E

When exposed to specific wavelengths of UV light, <b>photochromics</b> can reversibly switch between two isomeric forms of the chemical species.

40|$|Abstract. Certain organic {{compounds}} posess {{the ability to}} change color {{under the influence of}} light, called photochromism. This change is often due to ultrafast chemical transition from open to closed ring isomers (photocyclization). Information thechnology applications of these <b>photochromics</b> require the reverse transformation to be very slow in the dark. We have applied Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods to predict kinetics of this cycloreversion. This cycloreversion occurs through symmetry forbidden conrotatory electrocyclic mechanism with transition state of strong diradical character, and requires the unrestricted broken-symmetry DFT formalism. Our results suggest that B 3 LYP functional describes the activation barrier for the cycloreversion process with about 1 - 2 kcal/mol error, while M 052 x functional gives an error of about 2 - 3 kcal/mol compared to the experimental values...|$|E

30|$|Of {{particular}} {{interest is the}} photo-isomerization of spiropyrans, between the colorless, non-ionic spiro and the colored, charged merocyanine forms [9]. This family of <b>photochromics</b> has been well studied and been shown to induce changes in materials such as liquid crystal phase structure [10], light-induced reversible dissolution of SP-modified block copolypeptide micelles for drug release [8] and modifying the self-assembly of lipid and surfactant membranes [11 – 14]. Notably, lipid-based liquid crystal materials are receiving current interest as pulsatile active release systems as they can form thermodynamically stable nanostructures, which control the rate of drug release from the material [15 – 20]. They can also be rendered pH responsive by inclusion of ionizable lipids for selective release during oral drug delivery [21]. Sufficient disturbance in the lipid packing can cause a change in nanostructure and thus ‘trigger’ a change in drug release. Using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we have previously shown reversible control over the nanostructure using temperature as a stimulus, and consequent drug release rates from the liquid crystal matrix both in vitro and in vivo [22]. However, for some applications, direct heat is not practical and a non-invasive stimulus is necessary.|$|E
40|$|AbstractElectronic {{excitation}} by lasers or electron beams can {{modify the}} properties of materials. The changes are not just due to heat, nor do they result from the well-known collision dynamics of much radiation damage. Everyday examples of modification by electronic excitation include photography, and <b>photochromics</b> (such as sunglasses) which change colour. In {{the last few years}} it has become clear that excitation can offer novel types of modification, with better-controlled changes. The field has evolved through a mix of basic science, of new laser and electron beam tools, and of new needs from microelectronics, photonics and nanotechnology. Underlying this development are some common themes which integrate the basic science and its applications. These include especially the ideas of energy localisation and charge localisation. There are detailed comparisons of experiment and theory for halides, but there is a wealth of information for other materials. From this, we identify ways to connect understanding to technological needs, like selective removal of material, controlled changes, altering the balance between process steps, and possibilities of quantum control. The field is reviewed in full in our recent book [N. Itoh, A. M. Stoneham, Materials Modification by Electronic Excitation, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2000]...|$|E
40|$|A {{definition}} and {{a survey of}} property changes of photochro-mic systems is given. The known photochromic molecules are treated. A new class of <b>photochromics</b> is introduced, proper-ty changes are discussed and a short general overview of applications for classical and new systems is presented. Chemistry, especially photochemistry is developing rapidly in new directions. Whereas in the past molecules and their properties {{have been in the}} center of interest this aspect is only the basis for further problems or questions. Functions of molecules are an additi-onal requirement which have to be investigated. Functions open then a way to applications either in the field of material science or life sciences. Photochromism is an exemplary field in this respect (ref. 1). This paper is treating these aspects in the context mentioned. Photochromism can be defined in simple terms as a light induced (at last in one direction) conversion of a species A to an isomer B, where A and B have different absorption spectra and energy content. hv A d mono-molecular h or hv 2 bi-molecular hu A + B + [...] ! [...] A C A or hu 2 The higher energy content of B in many cases is the driving force for an isomerization back to A. The requirements for photochromism are 1) a light induced isomerization (in the visible spectrum) and 2) reversibility This monomolecular definition has however to be extended to bimole-cular reversible reactions. A survey of property changes on the molecular and supramolecular level, possible in photochromic systems, is given in table 1. Photochromic systems can involve very different structural or bond changes. The systems known are in many cases based on the following simple reactions or processes (ref. 2). cis-trans-isomerization pericyclic reaction intramolecular electrocyclic reaction intermolecular cycloaddition tautomerism (H-transfer) bond cleavage electron transfer reactions physical photochromic systems overview of the known photochromic classes is given first...|$|E
40|$|Low-cost {{electro-optical}} devices with fast, highly controllable {{and simple}} operation mechanisms, {{as well as}} long term stability are highly desirable for future generations of smart window technologies. There are different types of smart window technologies, for example thermochromics, <b>photochromics,</b> electrochromics, gaschromics, reflective metal hydrides, polymer-dispersed liquid crystals, gel-glass dispersed liquid crystal and dipole particle suspension (DPS) (also called suspended particle devices). From these solutions, the DPS devices allow great control of the transmittance of solar radiation and are also relatively simple. Here we report electro-optical properties of electrospun anatase TiO 2 nanowire dispersions in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). It was found that changes in optical properties during TiO 2 nanowire orientation in PDMS {{under the influence of}} an electric field are strongly influenced by nanowire (NW) diameter. It was found {{for the first time that}} either positive or negative change in transmittance can be induced by NW alignment parallel to the electric field depending on the NW diameter. Reported experimental findings could be important for smart window applications for the regulation of visible or even infrared transparency. In addition concentrations used in this study were 200 times lower than previously reported for titanium-based DPS devices, because the change in transmittance is attributed to a decrease of light scattering not absorption cross-section during the nanowire orientation along the direction of the electric field. The measurements of the influence of nanowire concentration and electric field strength on the nanowire orientation kinetics show that the device can be operated using electric fields as low as 0. 1 V/μm and the magnitude of the change in transmittance can be adjusted by varying the TiO 2 nanowire concentration in the PDMS matrix. A transmittance change of 23 % was obtained with a DPS device using a suspension of 0. 05 wt% electrospun anatase TiO 2 in PDMS...|$|E
40|$|Photochromism {{has been}} {{investigated}} extensively during recent years. The large interest for information storage in memory applications {{is associated with the}} bi-stable character of the photochromism phenomena. In molecular <b>photochromics,</b> two isomers with different absorption spectrum can be obtained according to the specific wavelength of the light exposure. This reversible transformation process can be considered as optical writing/erasing step of a memory. Here we first report the absorption spectra of solid-state films based on the blends consisting of PC molecules, the spirooxazine 1, 3 -dihydro- 1, 3, 3 -trimethylspiro[2 H-indole- 2, 3 ’-[3 H]phenanthr[9, 10 -b](1, 4) oxazine] (PIII, Sigma-Aldrich, 32, 256 - 3) and a polymer matrix host, poly(2 -methoxy- 5 (2 ’-ethylhexyloxy) - 1, 4 -phenylenevinylene) (MEH-PPV). The bi-stability in conjugated polymer matrix is studied by following the time evolution of the optical properties of the blends. Thereafter, the electrical performance of PC-polymer diodes is characterized and reported. While the PIII molecules in the blend bulks are switched to their low energy gap state, forming external energy levels above the valence band of MEH-PPV, the injected charges (hole-dominated) will be trapped by the low energy gap isomer of PIII and that leads to current modulation. PIII molecules can be switched between two energy gap states upon the photo-stimulation, and the I-V characteristics of the device can also be controlled reversibly via the photoisomerization. The retention time of the diode’s electrical switching fits quite well with the absorption characteristics of the blend films; this correspondence builds a good link between the film property and the device behavior. Furthermore, we observed a two-trap system in the blend diodes from the I-V curves, and a model is proposed which can explain the schematic concept of the trap-limited current modulation. To combine the knowledge and information from the investigations above, we tested a novel device design based on a bi-layer of the PC and polymer materials, and the promising result for future work is presented in the end...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Azobenzene based <b>photochromics</b> have been studied widely since {{the development of the}} first azo dye, Mauvine, by Perkin in 1856. Azo based dyes have been widely used in industry for over a century. The desire to study them arose from their ease of synthesis and the wide availability of colours which can be tuned by manipulation of the chromophores on the azo molecule itself. The ability of azobenzene to photoisomerise between trans and cis states is widely known. The change in dipole moment affords the ability to fine-tune surfaces via photoisomerisation of the azo molecule. The objective of this investigation was to alter the surface properties of a variety of substrates via the photoisomerisation reaction of several perfluoroalkyl derived azobenzene compounds. These compounds are novel and are based on the idea of the fluoroalkyl chain creating a superhydrophobic surface, similar to Teflon, which would change surface energy upon isomerisation of the azobenzene molecule to give a more hydrophilic surface. This would ultimately then be utilised to coat a fabric surface to provide a photosensitive coating. The compounds used in this work (Admat 1 and 2 and Cfam derivatives) were synthesised in order for their photochemistry in solution and on surfaces to be investigated. The studies began with the photoisomerisation investigations in solution and the calculation of the rate constant and finally the activation energies of these compounds in a variety of common solvents. Interesting results were observed in polar protic solvents which were investigated further. The discovery that aggregation occurred in polar protic solvents due to solubility issues, which in turn led to a fast rate constant was a key finding of the solution work. The surface studies began with the investigation of cellulose as a substrate due to the structural similarity it has with cotton. The azo compounds were derivatised using cyanuric chloride to afford a triazinyl group which was able to attach {{to the surface of the}} cellulose via the hydroxyl groups on the surface...|$|E
40|$|Air dried {{films of}} purple {{membranes}} (PM) from Halobacterium halobium containing the photochromic protein bacteriorhodopsin (BR) were prepared and the BR-photocycle {{of this material}} analyzed. The absorption maxima of the initial state B (λmax = 570 nm) and the photochemical intermediate M (λmax = 412 nm), which is the longest living intermediate in suspension (τ ≈ 10 ms), were spectrally well separated. Light-induced population gratings between B and M were used for reversible holographic recording in these dry PM films. The resolution (> 5, 000 lines/mm) of PM films was comparable to the corresponding values of conventional photochromic recording materials. The longterm stability toward photochemical degradation of PM films is excellent (> 100. 000 recording cycles). The spectral bandwidth (400 - 680 nm) of such films covers nearly the whole visible spectrum. Both the photochemical transition from B → M with wavelengths in the green-red range and from M → B with blue light were utilized for holographic recording. The latter possibility (M → B) seems to be advantageous for several applications because the holographic grating is only formed during reconstruction. Higher reading intensities lead to higher population of the M-state and result in an increase of the fringe contrast instead of decreasing it. New possibilities for the further development of holographic media based on bacteriorhodopsin are raised by the availability of PM variants with modified optical properties. By {{the use of the}} variant BR- 326, which differs from the wildtype PM by a single amino acid exchange (aspartate- 96 → asparagine), the sensitivity of PM films is increased by ∼ 50 % from 12 cm 2 /J to 19 cm 2 /J for recording with 568 nm. The sensitivity for recording with 413 nm (33 cm 2 /J) is not influenced by the amino acid exchange. The observed diffraction efficiency η of PM films with BR- 326 is twice that of BR-wildtype (BR-WT) films and is in the range of conventional organic <b>photochromics</b> (≈ 1 %). In dried films of both BR-WT and BR- 326 the M-decay was shown to be at least biexponential...|$|E
