5|$|Each entry {{was limited}} to a length of 100650 words. To allow some time for {{drafting}} and <b>proofreading,</b> participants were allowed to upload their diary entries {{until the end of}} the month. Schoolchildren were encouraged to take part, with all 29,000 UK schools being invited to participate. On the day itself, the homepages of the 2,000 computers in the easyCafe network were all set to the History Matters website, and several celebrities and public figures also voiced their support of the initiative, including Stephen Fry, Bob Geldof and Tony Robinson.|$|E
5|$|In DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases {{make copies}} of DNA polynucleotide chains. To {{preserve}} biological information, {{it is essential that}} the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a <b>proofreading</b> activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is activated and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.|$|E

5|$|Kishi {{specifically}} {{requested that}} sound and music director Satoki Iida {{work on the}} project, who also helped with the <b>proofreading</b> of the script due to Maeda's fixation on the music production. Iida was interviewed in the April 2010 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where it was stated that Maeda and the group Anant-Garde Eyes received Iida's approval to employ a minimalist approach to the background music (BGM) used throughout the anime. Iida admitted that it was uncustomary to use this music genre in anime {{and that he had}} to go through various trials and errors with Maeda and Anant-Garde Eyes to get the music right. Maeda and Anant-Garde Eyes strove to create individual quality music tracks, while Iida pursued the goal of having music that would be useful as BGM tracks, which caused problems during the creation process. Iida realized that it was important for the music and the visuals to combine together to create a synchronization between the two. Toba first took notice of Angel Beats! character designer and chief animator Katsuzō Hirata during the production of Gurren Lagann (2007) with his skill as an artist and ability to finish work quickly, but thoroughly. It was after Toba saw Hirata's work as chief animator of Strike Witches (2008), however, that he pursued Hirata to join the Angel Beats! staff; Maeda also gave his seal of approval for Hirata.|$|E
5|$|Scholar-officials and gentry also {{distinguished}} {{themselves through}} their intellectual pursuits. While {{some such as}} Shen Kuo (1031–1095) and Su Song (1020–1101) dabbled in every known field of science, study, and statecraft, Song elites were generally most interested in the leisurely pursuits of composing and reciting poetry, art collecting and antiquarianism. Yet even this pursuit {{could turn into a}} scholarly one. It was the official, historian, poet, and essayist Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) who compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze which pioneered ideas in early epigraphy and archeology. Shen Kuo even took an interdisciplinary approach to archeological study, in order to aid his work in astronomy, mathematics, and recording ancient musical measures. The scholar-official and historian Zeng Gong (1019–1083) reclaimed last chapters of the ancient Zhan Guo Ce, <b>proofreading</b> and editing the version that would become the accepted modern version. The ideal official and gentry scholars were also expected to employ these intellectual pursuits {{for the good of the}} community, such as writing local histories or gazetteers. In the case of Shen Kuo and Su Song, their pursuits in academic fields such as classifying pharmaceuticals and improving calendrical science through court work in astronomy fit this ideal.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the <b>proofreading</b> {{mechanisms}} of DNA polymerase {{those of the}} RNA variety have only recently been investigated. <b>Proofreading</b> begins with separation of the mis-incorporated nucleotide from the DNA template. This pauses transcription. The polymerase then backtracks by one position and cleaves the dinucleotide that contains the mismatched nucleotide. In the RNA polymerase this occurs at the same active site used for polymerization and is therefore markedly different from the DNA polymerase where <b>proofreading</b> occurs at a distinct nuclease active site.|$|E

50|$|On September 2, {{a faulty}} key-command was sent up to Phobos 1 from ground control in Yevapatoria. A {{technician}} unintentionally left out a single hyphen {{in one of}} the keyed commands. All commands were supposed to be <b>proofread</b> by a computer before being transmitted, but the computer that checked code was malfunctioning. The technician violated procedure and transmitted the command before the computer could be fixed to <b>proofread</b> it. This minor alteration in code caused the end-of-mission command to reach the spacecraft; shutting down all of the systems aboard Phobos 1.|$|R

25|$|The {{publisher}} usually {{controls the}} advertising and other marketing tasks, but may subcontract {{various aspects of}} the process to specialist publisher marketing agencies.

25|$|Elongation also {{involves}} a <b>proofreading</b> mechanism that can replace incorrectly incorporated bases. In eukaryotes, this may correspond with short pauses during transcription that allow appropriate RNA editing factors to bind. These pauses may be intrinsic to the RNA polymerase or due to chromatin structure.|$|E

25|$|The {{small size}} of RNA viruses has been {{proposed}} to be locked into a three part relation between replication fidelity, genome size and genetic complexity. The majority of RNA viruses lack an RNA <b>proofreading</b> facility which limits their replication fidelity and hence the genome size. This has also {{been described as the}} Eigen paradox.|$|E

Misspellings, not uncommon at the time, are retained so readers can see what Madison saw.|$|E

25|$|The m6A {{modification}} affects tRNA incorporation’s distinct {{steps in}} different ways. It slows down GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu 12-fold, delays tRNA accommodation two-fold, and it slows down peptidyl transfer two-fold. It also causes a 1.5-fold {{increase in the}} amount of GTP hydrolyzed per peptidyl transfer, which indicates that a lot of <b>proofreading</b> is required. Overall, this m6A modification leads to a kinetic loss of a factor of 18.|$|E
25|$|No {{longer in}} college, Williams began work in 1904 in a Methodist bookroom. He {{was hired by}} the Oxford University Press (OUP) as a <b>proofreading</b> {{assistant}} in 1908 and quickly climbed to the position of editor. He continued to work at the OUP in various positions of increasing responsibility until his death in 1945. One of his greatest editorial achievements was the publication of the first major English-language edition of the works of Søren Kierkegaard.|$|E
25|$|Reverse {{transcriptase}} {{has a high}} {{error rate}} when transcribing RNA into DNA since, unlike most other DNA polymerases, it has no <b>proofreading</b> ability. This high error rate allows mutations to accumulate at an accelerated rate relative to proofread forms of replication. The commercially available reverse transcriptases produced by Promega are quoted by their manuals as having error rates {{in the range of}} 1 in 17,000 bases for AMV and 1 in 30,000 bases for M-MLV.|$|E
