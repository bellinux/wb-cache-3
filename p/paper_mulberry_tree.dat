The bark, after being soaked in water, is beaten out by means of wooden mallets, which are grooved longitudinally.... Early in the morning," [...] says Mariner, [...] "when the air is calm and still, the beating of the gnatoo at all the plantations about has a very pleasing effect; some sounds being near at hand, and others almost lost by the distance, some a little more acute, others more grave, and all with remarkable regularity, produce a musical variety that is ... heightened by the singing of the birds, and the cheerful influence of the scene."--Polynesia, 1846, pp. 249, 250.] ...|$|E
5000|$|This [...] "rice paper", smooth, thin, crackly, and strong, {{is named}} as a wrapper for rice, and {{is made from}} bark fibres of the <b>paper</b> <b>mulberry</b> <b>tree.</b> It is used for origami, calligraphy, paper screens and clothing. It is {{stronger}} than commercially made wood-pulp paper. Less commonly, the paper is made from rice straw.|$|E
50|$|The {{making of}} Tapa cloth, or (masi), is another craft {{associated}} with women. Tapa {{is made from}} the bark of the <b>paper</b> <b>mulberry</b> <b>tree</b> and decorated in charcoal with symbolic motifs and various patterns. In modern times, it has become fashionable for a masi to bear {{the name of the}} person who made it. Masi are often exchanged as gifts on formal occasions. The island of Vatuelele of the southern coast of Viti Levu is famous for its masi products.|$|E
50|$|Birds are abundant, but feral pigs are {{the only}} large mammals. Coconut and areca palms, pawpaw, breadfruit, and <b>paper</b> <b>mulberry</b> <b>trees</b> are planted near housesites, and yams, taro, and greens are grown as the first crop in swidden gardens, with bananas and plantains as the second crop.|$|R
5000|$|The {{name comes}} from molo aa in the Hawaiian {{language}} which means [...] "matted roots". <b>Paper</b> <b>Mulberry</b> <b>trees</b> (Broussonetia papyrifera, or wauke in Hawaiian) once grew so thickly that the roots were interwoven. The Moloaʻa Stream empties into {{the north end of}} a beach which is backed by high cliffs.Uphill from the bay is the Moloaʻa State Forest Reserve.|$|R
25|$|More recent {{excavations}} {{focused on}} an area {{believed to have}} held <b>paper</b> <b>mulberry</b> trees; Jefferson planted two rows {{in order to help}} create naturalistic wings to complement the Palladian style of his retreat house. Archaeologists at Poplar Forest found stains in the ground indicating areas in which trees were previously planted, and their goal is to analyze the levels of charcoal and pollen to determine which areas were most likely the original location(s) for the <b>paper</b> <b>mulberry</b> <b>trees.</b> Other ongoing and future excavation plans include the area surrounding an antebellum slave cabin as well as Jefferson’s ornamental plant nursery.|$|R
5000|$|He also, as in {{the other}} films, on {{occasion}} set up scenes in which exotic earlier practices were re-enacted as if still current. In Nanook and Man of Aran, it included setting up anachronistic hunting sequences. In Moana, {{at a time when}} Samoans were typically wearing modern Western-style clothing under the influence of Christian missionaries, Flaherty persuaded his performers to don traditional tapa cloth costumes (made from the bark of the <b>paper</b> <b>mulberry</b> <b>tree,</b> in a process shown in some detail in the film); the [...] "maidens" [...] went topless.|$|E
50|$|All {{these words}} give some {{clue to the}} origin. Masi could mean the (bark of the) dye-fig (Ficus tinctoria), endemic to Oceania, and {{probably}} the one originally used to make tapa. Somewhere in history, during the voyages of migration the hiapo or siapo was introduced from Southeast Asia, the <b>paper</b> <b>mulberry</b> <b>tree</b> (Broussonetia papyrifera). The bark of this tree is much better to use, and put {{the use of the}} dye-fig into oblivion. Only its name remained in Fiji. Tapa finally has the meaning of border or strip. It seems likely that before the glueing process became common to make large sheets (see below) only narrow strips were produced.|$|E
50|$|In Tonga hiapo is {{the name}} given to the <b>paper</b> <b>mulberry</b> <b>tree.</b> People have bunches of them growing {{in a corner of}} their plantations. They are cut and brought home where the first task is to strip the bark from the trees. The strips are about hand wide and person long. The wood left over is named mokofute. The bark {{consists}} of two layers; the outer bark is scraped or split off from the inner bark. This work is called haalo. The outer bark is discarded; the inner bark, named tutu or loututu, is left over. It is dried in the sun before being soaked.|$|E

5000|$|Woodblock {{prints from}} Japan are {{commonly}} printed on kozo, <b>paper</b> made from <b>mulberry</b> <b>tree</b> fibers. Many pigments {{were derived from}} organic materials. For example, some blue hues were derived from dayflower petals. Other inorganic colorants, such as red lead, were also used.|$|R
50|$|Japanese {{tissue is}} a thin, strong paper made from {{vegetable}} fibers. Japanese tissue {{may be made}} from one of three plants, the kōzo plant (Broussonetia papyrifera, <b>paper</b> <b>mulberry</b> <b>tree),</b> the mitsumata (Edgeworthia chrysantha) shrub and the gampi tree (Diplomorpha sikokiana). The long, strong fibers of the kozo plant produce very strong, dimensionally stable papers, and are {{the most commonly used}} fibers in the making of Japanese paper (washi). Tissue made from kōzo, or kōzogami (楮紙), comes in varying thicknesses and colors, and is an ideal paper to use in the mending of books. The majority of mending tissues are made from kōzo fibers, though mitsumata and gampi papers also are used.|$|E
50|$|In December, the {{psychiatric}} hospital in Boston calls and informs Gram that Liza is {{in a critical}} state and may not live much longer. Dicey and Gram travel to Boston, and find Liza catatonic, not responding to any treatment. Liza soon dies and, since they can't afford {{the cost of a}} funeral or of transporting Liza's body from Boston to Crisfield, Gram and Dicey decide to cremate her. Dicey is given a hand-carved wooden box by the owner of a local gift store who is touched by her situation. When Dicey and Gram arrive back in Crisfield, the family buries the wooden box containing their mother's ashes under the <b>paper</b> <b>mulberry</b> <b>tree</b> in their front yard, which to the Tillermans is important to the family because of its fragility and beauty.|$|E
50|$|Vatulele (Ringing rock) {{has much}} more to offer than its red prawns, {{extraordinary}} though they are. It is home to Fiji's most skillful makers of tapa cloth (masi), rock paintings {{and one of the}} world's most exclusive resorts. The masi comes from the bark of the <b>paper</b> <b>mulberry</b> <b>tree</b> and all over the island there are small clearings in the forest which have been planted with this tree. A visit to any of the island's four villages will bring with it the unceasing and hypnotic sound of heavy wooden clubs striking repeatedly against something solid. If you pluck up enough courage to venture inside the tin shed from whence the sound comes, you will see a sweating woman pounding strips of bark, flattening and softening the fibres sufficiently to make into the highest quality masi. Nearby, giant cauldrons full of dye made from mangrove bark bubble quietly to themselves. Most of the traditional designs used in the masi incorporate triangles and this motif {{has become one of the}} symbols of the Vatulele Island resort.|$|E

50|$|Korean {{paper or}} hanji (한지/韓紙) {{is the name}} of {{traditional}} handmade paper from Korea. Hanji is made from the inner bark of <b>Paper</b> <b>Mulberry,</b> a <b>tree</b> native to Korea that grows well on its rocky mountainsides, known in Korean as dak. The formation aid crucial to making hanji is the mucilage that oozes from the roots of Hibiscus manihot. This substance helps suspend the individual fibers in water.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Paper</b> <b>Mulberry</b> is a {{commonly}} grown plant in Asia, {{growing in the}} feet of mountains that {{gets a lot of}} sunlight, reaching a growth height of usually 3 meters. In Korean history, people used the fibers from these trees to make clothes, and they began to use it as the source for paper during the Goryeo dynasty. The Joseon dynasty, which came after Goryeo, recommended people to grow more of these <b>mulberry</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|R
40|$|Tapa, or barkcloth, {{is central}} to the {{cultural}} identity, social relations, politics, history, and contemporary religion of people from the South Pacific Kingdom of Tonga. Large and ornate textiles made from the beaten inner bark of the <b>paper</b> <b>mulberry</b> <b>tree</b> are designed and made only by women. During 2003 – 04, the Center for Art and Public Life at the California College of the Arts completed a collaborative project entitled Pieces of Cloth, Pieces of Culture: Tongan Tapa Cloth. Under the direction of Ping-Ann Addo, The Center’s 2003 – 04 Scholar-in-Residence, Tongan women tapa-cloth artists from Oakland produced a full-sized (15 ft. x 15 ft.) tapa cloth and held educational programs, mounted an exhibition, and made a video documentary about Tongan tapa cloth and Tongan culture in the Bay Area. With support from the Department of Anthropology at the California Academy, the cloth was exhibited in 2004 at the Gallery, State Building on Clay Street, Oakland, and at one TSA venue for the 2004 Biennial Symposium. This presentation was collaborative: Dr. Addo presented images, words, and recorded work songs highlighting the production of the tapa-cloth, while the lead Tongan woman artist, Mrs. Siu Tuita, reflected upon and answered audience questions about what it has meant to them to produce the first full-sized, allnatural Tongan tapa in the mainland United States. We also discussed the merits, and challenges, of striving to enhance a new sense of community solidarity with collaborative projects of this nature...|$|E
40|$|In Samoa and Tonga, Tapa is {{made from}} treated bark of the <b>paper</b> <b>mulberry</b> <b>tree</b> (Broussonetia papyrifera L. Moraceae) (Bunnell 2004). The word tapa refers to the uncolored border of {{completed}} siapo/ngatu, and its generic use for bark cloth is attributed to early mariners. The finished product siapo (Samoa) and ngatu (Tonga) remain an aspect of female cultural knowledge and wealth. Significantly, despite the evolution of tapa materials and discontinuity of functional uses of the textile; gendered spaces within which tapa exists is maintained and women are still considered the cultural knowers, producers and presenters of this important heritage art form. This paper {{is based on the}} findings of a qualitative study exploring the views of contemporary cultural communities on the cultural memory and practice of tapa in Samoa and Tonga. It begins from the premise that Tongan occupation of Samoa, believed to have lasted about 300 years and ending around 1300 A. D. (Meleisea 1987), invariably resulted in shared cultural practice and ideologies. Tapa culture is posited as a significant epistemological site of Indigenous Knowledge Systems. The process of meaning-making in symbolic interactionism is examined through the lens of the motif as cultural symbol and textual narrative. Additionally, the spiritual concept of v� 1 (relational space) is presented as a life philosophy reinforced through the lived experience and practice of tapa culture. The main assertion is the idea that holistic understanding of tapa requires a re-positioning of narrative that begins from an indigenous standpoint (Koya Vaka 19 uta, 2013). ...|$|E
40|$|Notes on the kumara or New Zealand {{sweet potato}} as a taonga or treasure. Like many Aucklanders, {{the people of}} New Zealand’s largest city, I live {{on the slopes of}} one the region’s many extinct (we hope) volcanoes, known as “Maungawhau”. Anyone who walks over these grassy cones can tell you that European New Zealanders like myself were not the first people to live here. Today Maungawhau still shows clear signs of the terraced {{contours}} and ditches that made up the defences of a traditional Maori pa or hill fort, which the area’s first inhabitants either retired to in times of war or permanently inhabited. Also evident are numerous shallow pits of great significance because many were used to store kumara- sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas). This tuber was the Maoris ’ most important food crop. Evidence of pre-European kumara gardening and storage is found over most of the North Island and {{the top half of the}} South Island of New Zealand. This paper will give a brief account of how the kumara came to be considered a taonga, or treasure, by both Maori and Pakeha (European) New Zealanders. Several conflicting scientific theories attempt to explain how the kumara came from its home in South America to eastern then western Polynesia, but it was with the Maori that it later came south to New Zealand about 1000 years ago. Transporting this tropical plant by sea in open canoes and successfully cultivating it 1000 kilometres south of anywhere it had previously grown testify to the Maoris ’ skills as cultivators. They brought other plants from their ancestral homeland of Hawaiiki, such as taro, gourd, <b>paper</b> <b>mulberry</b> <b>tree,</b> breadfruit, tropical cabbage tree and coconut. Most failed in New Zealand’s colder climate. Of those that survived, the kumara, taro and ya...|$|E

They played tug-of-war between east team and west team. in 1930, the winning team in tug-of-war made the mask playing for the celebration. When the festival day comes, people gathered together at bridge(busan bridge, buma bridge) and had costume parade to the place where the mask performance played. In the parade, nongjang stands the first and other characters and nongak bands follow.
