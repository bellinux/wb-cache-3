5|$|After the Revolution, Prokofiev left Russia {{with the}} {{official}} blessing of the Soviet minister Anatoly Lunacharsky, and resided in the United States, then Germany, then Paris, making his living as a composer, <b>pianist</b> <b>and</b> conductor. During that time he married a Spanish singer, Carolina Codina, {{with whom he had}} two sons. In the early 1930s, the Great Depression diminished opportunities for Prokofiev's ballets and operas to be staged in America and western Europe. Prokofiev, who regarded himself as composer foremost, resented the time taken by touring as a <b>pianist,</b> <b>and</b> increasingly turned to Soviet Russia for commissions of new music; in 1936 he finally returned to his homeland with his family. He enjoyed some success there – notably with Lieutenant Kijé, Peter and the Wolf, Romeo and Juliet, and perhaps above all with Alexander Nevsky.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Lee Flanagan (March 16, 1930– November 16, 2001) was an American jazz <b>pianist</b> <b>and</b> composer.

5|$|As {{political}} awareness among the black majority {{on the island}} spread, so did bebop, a kind of jazz which was associated, in the United States, with social activism and Afrocentrism. The first Barbadian bebop musician from the island was Keith Campbell, a pianist who had learned to play many styles while living in Trinidad {{during a time when}} American soldiers were stationed there, providing a ready market for bands that could play American music. Other musicians of this period included Ernie Small, a trumpeter and <b>pianist,</b> <b>and</b> bandleader St. Clare Jackman.|$|E

5|$|Chopin's qualities as a <b>pianist</b> <b>and</b> {{composer}} {{were recognized}} {{by many of}} his fellow musicians. Schumann named a piece for him in his suite Carnaval, and Chopin later dedicated his Ballade No. 2 in F major to Schumann. Elements of Chopin's music can be traced in many of Liszt's later works. Liszt later transcribed for piano six of Chopin's Polish songs. A less fraught friendship was with Alkan, with whom he discussed elements of folk music, and who was deeply affected by Chopin's death.|$|E
5|$|Cosima Wagner (born Francesca Gaetana Cosima Liszt; 24 December 1837– 1 April 1930) was the illegitimate {{daughter}} of the Hungarian <b>pianist</b> <b>and</b> composer Franz Liszt and Marie d'Agoult. She became the second wife of the German composer Richard Wagner, and with him founded the Bayreuth Festival as a showcase for his stage works; after his death she devoted {{the rest of her}} life to the promotion of his music and philosophy. Commentators have recognised Cosima as the principal inspiration for Wagner's later works, particularly Parsifal.|$|E
