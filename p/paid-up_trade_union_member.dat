50|$|According to ABS figures, in August 2013, {{there were}} 1.7 million <b>members</b> of <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> in {{relation}} to their main job (17% of all employees). A further 4% did not know whether they were <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>members</b> or not, while 1% were <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>members</b> not in conjunction with their main job. Of those who were a <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>member</b> {{in relation to}} their main job, over two thirds (68%) had been members for five years or more. <b>Trade</b> <b>union</b> membership has steadily declined over recent years, with 2013 being the lowest proportion {{in the history of the}} ABS series. According to ACTU figures, the number of <b>members</b> of <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> in 1983 was 2,376,900 but by 2002 it was 1,833,700, and declining.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{sets out}} to explore the roots of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> members’ job dissatisfaction, as {{a large body of}} prior quantitative research, spanning more than four decades, indicates that <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>members</b> express higher levels of job dissatisfaction than non-union members. Industrial relations scholars {{have not been able to}} agree on an explanation as to why <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>members</b> express comparatively more job dissatisfaction. The ambiguity in establishing a causal relationship between <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> membership and job dissatisfaction is due to the fact that previous works have largely been biased towards the use of quantitative methods. The present study, therefore, uses a unique qualitative approach consisting of grounded theoretical techniques and interviews with 43 <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>members</b> to gather new insights on the topic. Interviews were conducted at two case study organisations, one a manufacturer and the other a public services organisation, in Scotland. Three alternative explanations that have sought to explain <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> members’ job dissatisfaction were unpacked. These explanations link <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> members’ job dissatisfaction to (i) unmet expectations from <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> membership, (ii) awareness of inequalities and (ii) industrial relations climates. The aim of this dissertation was to develop insights to enable a better understanding of why <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>members</b> appear to express dissatisfaction with their jobs. The grounded theoretical approach has enabled at least three contributions to the industrial relations literatures and, to a lesser extent, to the human resources and job satisfaction literatures. These contributions are: (i) a deep, qualitative approach towards understanding the phenomenon; (ii) a critical evaluation of three alternative explanations of the phenomenon; and (iii) insights towards an initial model explaining the roots of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> members’ job dissatisfaction...|$|R
30|$|The {{opportunities}} to limit collective bargaining outcomes to <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>members,</b> as described {{with respect to}} vacation entitlements in the Introduction, are limited by law. Closed-shop arrangements, for example, are not allowed and the constitution grants all individuals the right to set up <b>trade</b> <b>unions,</b> or to abstain from doing so, and declares all steps to obstruct this right as illegal. Additionally, the Non-discrimination Law (Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz), which implements requirements originating from various European Union directives, explicitly forbids a disadvantageous treatment of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>members.</b> By analogy, also a differential treatment of non-members is restricted. In particular, {{it is not possible}} to prohibit firms from extending potentially preferential regulations for <b>members</b> of a <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> to non-members.|$|R
