5|$|Cultural {{attitudes toward}} gender roles have {{profound}} effects on people with SCI. The injury can cause insecurities surrounding sexual identity, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> disability precludes fulfilment of societally taught gender norms.|$|E
5|$|Breech-loading guns {{seemed to}} offer {{important}} advantages. A breech-loader could be reloaded without moving the gun, a lengthy process <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> gun then {{needed to be}} re-aimed. The Warriors Armstrong guns also had the virtue of being lighter than an equivalent smoothbore and, because of their rifling, more accurate. Nonetheless, the design was rejected because of problems which plagued breech-loaders for decades.|$|E
5|$|TSH {{levels are}} {{considered}} the most sensitive marker of thyroid dysfunction. They are however not always accurate, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> cause of hypothyroidism {{is thought to be}} related to insufficient TRH secretion, in which case it may be low or falsely normal. In such a case a TRH stimulation test, in which TRH is given and TSH levels are measured at 30 and 60-minutes after, may be conducted.|$|E

50|$|The {{detailed}} {{shape of}} the scanning tip is sometimes difficult to determine. Its effect on the resulting data is <b>particularly</b> noticeable <b>if</b> <b>the</b> specimen varies greatly in height over lateral distances of 10 nm or less.|$|R
5|$|Myxedema coma {{or severe}} decompensated {{hypothyroidism}} usually requires {{admission to the}} intensive care, close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, vasopressor agents, careful rewarming, and corticosteroids (for possible adrenal insufficiency which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with hypertonic saline solutions or vasopressin receptor antagonists. For rapid treatment of the hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> level of consciousness is too low {{to be able to}} safely swallow medication.|$|E
5|$|Not only do {{they affect}} injured people's self-image, these {{stereotypes}} are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation. Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> injury occurred {{at a young age}} and the patient never had sexual experiences. Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth control, information about sexuality, and sexual health-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance {{of the rest of the}} body and of the individual.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{symptom of}} prepatellar {{bursitis}} is the {{swelling of the}} area around the kneecap. It generally does not produce a significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly to the swelling. The area of swelling may be red (erythema), warm to the touch, or surrounded by cellulitis, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> area has become infected. In such cases, the bursitis is often accompanied by fever. Unlike arthritis, prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the range of motion of the knee, though it may cause some discomfort when the knee is completely flexed. Flexion and extension of the knee may cause crepitus.|$|E
50|$|Field blewits are {{generally}} regarded as edible, but they are known to cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. This is <b>particularly</b> likely <b>if</b> <b>the</b> mushroom is consumed raw, though allergic reactions are known even from cooked blewits.|$|R

5000|$|In some cases, the {{questionnaire}} should be reviewed by an ethics committee or outside party. [...] This is <b>particularly</b> important <b>if</b> <b>the</b> questionnaire involves giving sensitive information or {{the topic is}} one which may make some participants uncomfortable.|$|R
5|$|Whorf and Sapir both drew {{explicitly}} on Albert Einstein's {{principle of}} general relativity; hence linguistic relativity {{refers to the}} concept of grammatical and semantic categories of a specific language providing a frame of reference as a medium through which observations are made. Following an original observation by Boas, Sapir demonstrated that speakers of a given language perceive sounds that are acoustically different as the same, if the sound comes from the underlying phoneme and does not contribute to changes in semantic meaning. Furthermore, speakers of languages are attentive to sounds, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> same two sounds come from different phonemes. Such differentiation {{is an example of how}} various observational frames of reference leads to different patterns of attention and perception.|$|E
5|$|Larger drugs (>500 Da) can {{provoke a}} {{neutralizing}} immune response, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> drugs are administered repeatedly, or in larger doses. This limits {{the effectiveness of}} drugs based on larger peptides and proteins (which are typically larger than 6000 Da). In some cases, the drug itself is not immunogenic, but may be co-administered with an immunogenic compound, as is sometimes the case for Taxol. Computational methods {{have been developed to}} predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids; however, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins, as a training set. A publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells. The emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics. Immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins (proteomics) involved in the immune response.|$|E

25|$|Semi-conductor {{materials}} are often analysable in atom probe, however sample preparation {{may be more}} difficult, and interpretation of results may be more complex, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> semi-conductor contains phases which evaporate at differing electric field strengths.|$|E
25|$|After {{treatment}} patients gradually {{regain their}} vision {{over a period}} of a few weeks, although the visual acuity may not be as good as it was prior to the detachment, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> macula was involved {{in the area of the}} detachment.|$|E
25|$|Having the wickets in the gates, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> gates {{are above}} the breast wall, {{means that the}} water pouring in could swamp some boats in the lock. Filling the lock through {{culverts}} eliminated that problem, as well as putting the lock gate below the breast wall.|$|E
25|$|Disciplinary {{proceedings}} are <b>particularly</b> initiated <b>if</b> <b>the</b> judge {{fails to}} develop and deliver judicial decisions within <b>the</b> legal deadline, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> judicial council evaluated his work with a negative grade and if, without reasonable cause, the number of decisions made by the judge in one year is below average.|$|R
50|$|Cascading is {{syntactic}} sugar that {{eliminates the}} need to list the object repeatedly.

25|$|While Ashkenazi Jews recite {{a blessing}} at the {{beginning}} and end of Partial Hallel, some Sephardi Jews do not, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> blessing they recite {{at the beginning}} of Full Hallel is ligmor et hahallel (to complete the Hallel) instead of likro et hahallel (to read the Hallel) as recited by Ashkenazi Jews.|$|E
25|$|Many {{different}} {{materials are}} used for or on drill bits, depending on the required application. Many hard materials, such as carbides, are much more brittle than steel, and are far more subject to breaking, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> drill is not held at a very constant angle to the workpiece; e.g., when hand-held.|$|E
25|$|If no gravediggers are available, {{then it is}} {{additionally}} {{the function of the}} male society members to ensure that graves are dug. In Israel, members of chevra kadishas consider it an honor to not only prepare the body for burial but also to dig the grave for a fellow Jew's body, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> deceased was known to be a righteous person.|$|E
5000|$|Debt stigma: Debt {{collectors}} {{unaware that}} a debtor has {{moved out of}} a particular residence may continue their pursuit at the same location, resulting in harassment of innocent subsequent occupiers.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to internal combustion engines, Stirling engines {{have the potential}} to use renewable heat sources more easily, to be quieter, and to be more reliable with lower maintenance. They are preferred for applications that value these unique advantages, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> cost per unit energy generated {{is more important than the}} capital cost per unit power. On this basis, Stirling engines are cost competitive up to about 100kW.|$|E
25|$|Cancers of {{the bone}} are managed {{according}} to their type, their stage, prognosis, and what symptoms they cause. Many primary cancers of bone are treated with radiotherapy. Cancers of bone marrow may be treated with chemotherapy, {{and other forms of}} targeted therapy such as immunotherapy may be used. Palliative care, which focuses on maximising a person's quality of life, {{may play a role in}} management, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> likelihood of survival within five years is poor.|$|E
25|$|Ankle weights {{provide a}} large lever arm {{for a small}} amount of weight and are very {{effective}} at correcting head-down trim problems, but the addition of mass to the feet increases the work of propulsion significantly. This may not be noticed on a relaxed dive, where {{there is no need to}} swim far or fast, but if there is an emergency and the diver needs to swim hard, ankle weights will be a significant handicap, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> diver is marginally fit for the conditions.|$|E
