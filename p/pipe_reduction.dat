50|$|The {{locomotives}} perform much differently for {{the crews}} {{going up the}} grade. The #70 has more power and does not usually struggle with a loaded train, however the #192, with larger drivers, longer frame, and lower boiler pressure, needs to be run with the throttle wide open and speed adjusted with the Johnson Bar. The first grade {{right out of the}} station is upwards of 5%, and the #192 will stall and need to make another run at the hill if it loses enough momentum. The grade does flatten out for a couple hundred feet as it approaches the Thunderhead Gap bridge. The engineer will blow a warning whistle for the crossing just beyond the bridge, and as the train emerges from the trees, the throttle is opened up as the engine hits the second hill and grinds up the 3-4% grade to the horseshoe curve beyond Sawmill Rd. At the end of this curve, the #192 with its long frame will buck against the curvature which is evidenced by the wear on the frame behind the trailing and pilot trucks. After negotiating a small S-curve through a cut in the hillside, the grade steepens again to about 6% until topping over near the upper loop switch. The crew will need to have enough water in the boiler to keep the crown sheet of the firebox covered for the downhill trip, and while the engineer is blowing the whistle and making the first brake <b>pipe</b> <b>reduction,</b> the fireman is using the raging fire to inject water against the climbing pressure gauge.|$|E

The data included production data (net oil and water cut), choke opening, pipeline pressures, water qualities and scale composition. The study revealed that {{the main cause of}} scale formation is the presence of Ca+ 2 and Mg+ 2 in produced water and wax in oil. The scale consists of 78 % Ca+ 2, 12 % Mg+ 2 and 10 % wax. Investigations on removal methods revealed that the currently employed chemical removal method is effective; however the downtime (well shut down) is high making significant production cut. A method to reduce the cleaning down time is proposed. The pipeline is divided into two sections: aboveground and underground.

In the later, the segregation of gas bubbles and/or water droplets dispersed into viscous oil by swirling pipe flow {{may be beneficial}} by either providing a pre-separation mechanism (bubble and/or drop coalescer) or, {{in the case of}} water-in-oil dispersions, by causing a water-lubricated flow pattern to establish in the <b>pipe</b> (friction <b>reduction).</b> Works addressing these applications are rare in the literature. In this paper, the features and capabilities of swirling pipe flow axially induced by a vane-type swirl generator were investigated both numerically and experimentally. The numerical analysis has been carried out using a commercial CFD package for axial Reynolds numbers less than 2000. Pressure drop, tangential and axial velocity components as well as swirl intensity along a 5 cm i. d. size and 3 m long pipe were computed. Single phase flow experiments have been performed using a water-glycerin solution of 54 mPa s viscosity and 1210 kg/m(3) density as working fluid. The numerical predictions of the pressure drop were compared with the experimental data and agreement could be observed within the range of experimental conditions. The experiments confirmed that swirl flow leads to much higher friction factors compared with theoretical values for non-swirl (i. e. purely axial) flow. Furthermore, the addition of a conical trailing edge reduces vortex breakdown., Visualization of the two-phase swirling flow pattern was achieved by adding different amounts of air to the water-glycerin solution upstream the swirl generator.

40|$|Pipes {{in water}} {{distribution}} systems may change as they age. The accumulation of corrosion byproducts and suspended particles {{on the inside}} wall of aged pipes can increase pipe roughness and reduce pipe diameter. To quantify the hydraulic effects of irregular accumulation on the pipe walls, eleven aged pipes ranging in diameter from 0. 020 -m (0. 75 -in) to 0. 100 -m (4 -in) and {{with varying degrees of}} turberculation were located and subjected to laboratory testing. The laboratory test results were used to determine a relationship between <b>pipe</b> diameter <b>reduction</b> and Hazen-Williams C. This relationship, combined with a manipulation of the Hazen-Williams equation, provided a simple and direct method for correcting the diameters of aged pipes in distribution models. Using EPANET 2, the importance of correcting pipe diameters when modeling water distribution systems containing aged pipes was investigated. Correcting the pipe diameters in the sample network reduced the modeled water age by up to 10 % and changed the pattern of fluctuating water age that occurred as waters with different sources moved through the pipe network. In addition, two of the aforementioned aged pipes with diameters of 0. 025 -m (1 -in) and 0. 050 -m (2 -in) were modeled using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence modeling. Flow was computed at Reynolds numbers ranging from 6700 to 31, 000 using three turbulence models including a 4 -equation v 2 -f model, and 2 -equation realizable k-e; and k-Ï‰ models. In comparing the RANS results to the laboratory testing, the v 2 -f model was found to be most accurate, producing Darcy-Weisbach friction factors from 5 % higher to 15 % lower than laboratory-obtained values. The capability of RANS modeling to provide a detailed characterization of the flow in aged pipes was demonstrated. Large eddy simulation (LES) was also performed on a single 0. 050 -m (2 -in) pipe at a Reynolds number of 6800. The Darcy-Weisbach friction factor calculated using LES was 20 % less than obtained from experimental tests. Roughness elements smaller than the grid scale and deficiencies in the subgrid-scale model at modeling the complex three-dimensional flow structures due to the irregular pipe boundary were identified as likely sources of error.

40|$|Culverts are rehabilitated using {{a variety}} of techniques; the {{approach}} studied in this report focuses on the use of slip liners. Slip lining refers to installing a liner pipe inside a host pipe to extend its useful life. Slip lining reduces the diameter of the culvert; however, when a smooth-walled liner [e. g., high-density polyethylene (HDPE) ] is installed in a profiled-wall pipe (e. g., corrugated metal <b>pipe),</b> the <b>reduction</b> in hydraulic roughness helps to compensate for the reduction in flow area, minimizing any reduction in discharge capacity. In some cases, the discharge capacity may increase. A smaller diameter liner, made of smoother material, will likely produce larger pipe flow velocities relative to the host culvert. High velocities can potentially create a barrier for fish passage, discouraging their use in areas sensitive to fish passage. The objective of this research was to find ways to implement slip liners and still accommodate fish passage. A 60 -ft long, 2 -ft diameter, baffled slip liner was tested at seven slopes (0 - 3. 5 %) and at three flow rates per slope (1 - 4. 6 cfs). For comparison purposes, tests were also conducted on a smooth-walled (non-baffled) liner. Baffles were found to greatly increase the potential for low-flow fish passage, allowing passage up to slopes of 3. 5 %. Conversely, the smooth-walled liner prohibited passage beyond a 1. 0 % slope. The potential drawback to using baffles in a slip-lined culvert is the reduction in culvert flow capacity. Compared to the smooth-walled liner, the baffled culvert reduced the flow capacity of the culvert by about 74 % at pressurized, full pipe flow. Finally, velocity was measured with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) in the baffled culvert and turbulence values were calculated using four different methods. The Energy Dissipation Factor, or EDF, values had a close relationship with percent fish passing and if more testing is done, it {{could be used as a}} scaling factor to transfer fish passage data to other sized culverts. The results of this study, suggest that baffled slip-lined culverts can aid fish passage and are useful for culvert rehabilitation as long as the culvert can still maintain appropriate flow capacity...|$|R

In this study, I apply methods of bulk and clumped isotope thermometry to an operating geothermal energy facility in northern Nevada to see how those methods can better inform the facility owner, AltaRock Energy, Inc., about the occurrence of calcite scale in their power plant. I have taken water samples from five production wells, the combined generator effluent, shallow cold-water wells, monitoring wells, and surface water. I also collected calcite scale samples from within the production system. Water samples were analyzed for stable oxygen isotope composition (d 18 O). Calcite samples were analyzed for stable oxygen and carbon (d 13 C) composition, and clumped isotope composition (D 47). With two exceptions, the water compositions are very similar, likely indicating common origin and a well-mixed hydrothermal system. The calcite samples are likewise similar to one another. Apparent temperatures calculated from d 18 O values of water and calcite are lower than those recorded for the system. Apparent temperatures calculated from D 47 are several degrees higher than the recorded well temperatures. The lower temperatures from the bulk isotope data are consistent with temperatures that could be expected during a de-pressurization of the production system, which would cause boiling in the <b>pipes,</b> a <b>reduction</b> in system temperature, and rapid precipitation of calcite scale. However, the high apparent temperature indicated by the D 47 data suggests that the calcite is depleted in clumped isotopes given the known temperature of the system, which is inconsistent with this hypothesis. This depletion could instead result from disequilibrium isotopic fractionation during the aforementioned boil events, which would make both the apparent d 18 O-based and D 47 -based temperatures unrepresentative of the actual water temperature. This research can help improve our understanding of how isotopic analyses can better inform us about the movement of water through geothermal systems of the past and how it now moves through modern systems. Increased understanding of water movement in these systems could potentially allow for more efficient utilization of geothermal energy as a renewable resource...|$|R

Therefore a project concerning measurement quality assurance in district heating systems is in progress at LuleÃ¥ University of Technology. As a part of this project the possibility of self diagnostic techniques for flow meters is investigated. It is well known that installation effects greatly impair the flow measurement involved in heat metering. Thus this thesis focus on self diagnostics of different installation effects. The basic assumption is that the flow meter noise level is correlated to turbulence intensity. Since the turbulence intensity is effected by installation effects, the noise level can be used to detect conditions for which the flow meter shows erroneous results. In district heating applications the use of ultrasonic flow meters {{are becoming more and more}} frequent. The self diagnostic approach has therefore been investigated for a small size prototype ultrasonic flow meter. Single and double elbow pipe bends and <b>pipe</b> diameter <b>reductions</b> mounted in front of the meter and pulsating flow give rise to small but reproducible errors. The magnitude of the maximum errors were in the range of 2 to 4 % of flow rate. At low flow rates with pulsating flow the errors were larger. Also small commercial ultrasonic flow meters were investigated. These commercial meters are commonly used in heat meters in small district heating subscriber stations. The results demonstrate that both temperature changes and installation effects introduce errors in the flow measurements. By studying the noise level of the signal from the prototype ultrasonic flow meter it is clear that all installation effects tested caused a clear increase in the flow signal noise level. It is clear that no tested disturbance causing measurement errors, larger than 1 % of the flow rate, will pass undetected. Neither will normal conditions with a varying flow rate or single measurement outliers cause false alarms. It is anticipated that this increase in the future can be detected on-line by the flow meter itself giving it a self diagnostic capability. GodkÃ¤nd; 2001; 20061115 (haneit) </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a method which determines the {{steady-state}} hydraulics {{of a water}} distribution system, the Graph Matrix Partitioning Algorithm (GMPA), is presented. This method extends the technique of separating the linear and nonlinear parts {{of the problem and}} using the more time consuming nonlinear solver only on the nonlinear parts of the problem and faster linear techniques on the linear parts of the problem. The previously developed Forest-Core Partitioning Algorithm (FCPA) used this approach to separate the network graph's external forest from its looped core but did not address the fact that within the core of a network graph there may be many internal trees - nodes in series - for which a more economical linear process can be used. This extension of the separation process can significantly reduce the dimension of the nonlinear problem that must be solved: GMPA applied to eight case study networks with between 900 and 20, 000 <b>pipes</b> show <b>reductions</b> to between 5 % and 55 % of the core dimension (after FCPA). The separation of the problem into its nonlinear and linear parts involves no approximations, such as lumping or skeletonization, and the resulting solution is precisely the solution that would have been obtained by the slower technique of solving the entire network with a nonlinear solver. The new method is applied after the network has been separated into an external forest and core by the FCPA method. The GMPA identifies all the nodes in the core which are in series (the internal forest) and then iterates alternately on the remaining core (the (nonlinear) global step) and the internal forest (the (linear) local step). In this paper, it is formally shown that the smaller set of nonlinear equations in the GMPA corresponds to the network equations of a particular topological subgraph of the original graph. Using algebraic manipulations, the size of the linearized system to be solved is reduced to the number of nodes in the core having degree greater than two. For pipe models of real world applications that are derived from GIS datasets, this can mean a dramatic reduction {{of the size of the}} nonlinear problem that has to be solved. The main contributions of the paper are (i) the derivation and presentation of formal proofs for the new method and (ii) demonstrating how significant the reduction in the dimension of the nonlinear problem can be for suitable networks. The method is illustrated on a simple example. J. Deuerlein, S. Elhay, and A. R. Simpso...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of energy}} {{harvesting}} for powering wireless sensors is made more challenging in most applications by {{the requirement for}} customi zation to each specific application environment because of specificities of the availab le energy form, such as precise location, direction and motion frequency, as well a s the temporal variation and unpredictability of the energy source. Wireless pow er transfer from dedicated sources can overcome these difficulties, and in this work, the use of targeted ultrasonic power transfer as a possible method for remote powering o f sensor nodes is investigated. A powering system for pipeline monitoring sensors is described and studied experimentally, {{with a pair of}} identical, non 6 inert ial piezoelectric transducers used at the transmitter and receiver. Power transmission of 18 mW (Root 6 Mean 6 Square) through 1 m of a 118 mm diameter cast iron pipe, wi th 8 mm wall thickness is demonstrated. By analysis of the delay between tran smission and reception, including reflections from the pipeline edges, a transmission speed of 1000 m/s is observed, corresponding to the phase velocity of the L(0, 1) a xial and F(1, 1) radial modes of the <b>pipe</b> structure. A <b>reduction</b> of power delivery with water 6 filling is observed, yet over 4 mW of delivered power through a fully 6 filled pipe i s demonstrated. The transmitted power and voltage levels exceed the requirements fo r efficient power management, including rectification at cold 6 starting conditions, and for the operation of low 6 power sensor nodes.

40|$|Heavy oil {{reservoirs}} {{cover up}} two {{third of the}} world's hydrocarbon reservoirs. Even though it is vast energy resource, heavy oil recovery is not considered economical due to its high viscous properties. Generally horizontal wells {{are more suitable for}} heavy oil recovery. When the heavy oil is produced with water drive, a water breakthrough is expected in the higher permeable zones of the reservoir or in the heel of the well. Once water has reached the well, heavy oil reservoirs tend to produce more water than oil. In order to overcome this issue, inflow control devices are being used. Conventional inflow control devices (ICDs) are only capable in in delaying a water breakthrough. The disadvantage of ICDs is that, it cannot control the water inflow, once the water breakthrough has occurred. Autonomous inflow control valve (AICV) is designed to choke or stop the inflow as soon as the water breakthrough takes place. In order to evaluate the performance of AICVs for different reservoir conditions, OLGA-Rocx simulations were carried out. Simulations with fractured, heterogeneous and homogeneous reservoirs were performed. By comparing the obtained results with conventional ICDs {{it was found that the}} AICVs have a superior potential in limiting the water inflow to the base <b>pipe</b> (86 % <b>reduction</b> in water accumulation compared to normal ICDs in fractured reservoirs). It was also observed that, AICVs are more effective in heterogeneous and fractured reservoirs as it can restrict the early water breakthrough. Even in homogeneous reservoirs, AICVs have the capability in controlling the water inflow. As a result, oil production rate would also be reduced compared to the ICD system, however, the lifetime of the well will be increased by using AICV...|$|R
