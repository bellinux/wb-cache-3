This method has many advantages compared to on-site manufacturing, for example, the precision during the production process should be much higher than building each wall and floor on site. Furthermore, the quick erection procedure when using prefabricated elements and the possibility to use weather protection {{has the advantage of}} not being dependent on weather conditions, and many other factors. Masonite Beams AB is a Swedish company (a member of the Norwegian company, Byggma ASA) with a relatively new technology using light weight beams as bearing elements in the walls and a certain stiff board lamella slap which is mounted {{on the top of the}} floor structure creating an integrated stiff beam / board floor structure. The elements are flat which make it much easier to transport the elements from the factory to the building site where the building parts are easily mounted with special mounting stud. One of the main drawbacks of lightweight structure is the sound transmission.

40|$|The team {{researchers}} have been investigating on alternative ways for buildings to waste less energy. The result is the consecution of a new facade system with Peltier cells, that is to say, {{a new system of}} air conditioning that works both as a machine as a facade. That means the application in the field of construction of a technology that is already in use in other areas, fundamentally the military and aerospace. The new system has to be a <b>prefabricated</b> <b>element</b> that perfectly fix between the slabs. The result of all these ideas is the construction of a prefabricated module, consisting of a simplified inhabited housing unit with a thermoelectric installation that provides service to this module. The prototype has been monitored during one year. The University of Navarra has got the national patent for a “prefabricated and decentralized facade module for the climate control of inhabited spaces”. Moreover, the Thermoelectric Conditioning System (TCS) is designed to reach a high comfort level for people living in the local. Without mechanical parts like pumps or compressors, there is no necessity for maintenance, reducing the possibilities of failure. The only mechanical elements are the dissipation heat fans placed in the external face of the prototype. There are also some heat sinks to evacuate the heat from the power elements. The next step is improving the system as a facade, paying special attention to carry out the legal façade envelope’s requirements, such us, noise level, thermal transmittance, hydrothermal condition or behavior against fire. At the same time, {{it is going to be}} design a facade solution that tries to take advantage of inside and outside conditions in order to achieve the desire inside comfort conditions.

40|$|This is an {{investigation}} of a mobile prefabrication factory´s competitiveness and profitability which also {{will result in a}} suggestion for a design of the factory. The mobile prefabrication factory is an idea of a new concept for production which is meant {{to be used in the}} manufacture of slab. The main intention with this concept is that by using a fast established prefabrication factory to produce elements near the construction site, thus avoiding transport from the factory to the building site. This means not only an environmental and economic gain, but also that you can avoid risking damage the elements which often occur during transportation. The contractor is owner of the mobile prefabrication factory and can thus avoid long waiting times and cyclicality. These are parameters that often can be a concern when using <b>prefabricated</b> <b>element</b> from factory´s off-site. When the building is finished, the prefabrication factory is able to be packed onto trucks, moved, and reestablished close to next building site. The portable production capacity also means that production can be kept close to the product development and can therefore quickly test new solutions, thus this concept facilitating a continuous improvement.    After a rough estimate of the cost for the establishment, operation and maintenance turned out that the mobile prefabrication factory needs to be established by large projects that require more than 7   970 m 2 of slab in order to recoup these expenses. Then to recoup the investment cost of 5, 64 million crones the project must have a need for more than these 7   970 m 2 of slab. Counting on a life expectancy of 30 years for the mobile factory, the factory needs to produce 1   568 m 2 of slab á year, in addition to the slab required for accrued cost for establishment. ...|$|E
40|$|Some time ago, we have {{developed}} a computer programme called PRECON 3 D for a three-dimensional non-linear analysis of reinforced and prestressed concrete structures where the structures are discretized by three-dimensional finite elements with an embedded one-dimensional element of reinforcement and prestressed tendons. Non-linear triaxial behaviour of concrete {{is involved in the}} material model, including all dominant influences in concrete (yielding in compression, fracture in tension, softening and hardening). The non-linear behaviour of reinforcement and prestressed tendons is described by the one-dimensional elasto-viscoplastic model. The tendon element geometry is described by the second order space function which is determined by its projections. Programme PRECON 3 D can be used very simple because the material model is defined by elementary material parameters (Young’s modulus, Poisson’s coefficient, maximal uniaxial tensile and compression stresses, coefficient of tensile correction, maximal tensile and maximal compression strains). Furthermore, the developed model makes it possible to compute prestressing structures in phases including losses caused by friction and the losses which result from the concrete deformation. In the described analyses we have performed the numerical testing of the prestressed concrete girders from the engineering practice (<b>prefabricated</b> <b>element),</b> which were reinforced with various cross-sectional area of prestressed reinforcement and various tendons geometry. During analyses next parameters were observed: deflections of the girders, concrete stresses and strains at {{the top and bottom of}} the girders, compressive and tensile strains of the reinforcement. The paper presents the structural validation of developed numerical model, PRECON 3 D, on a few examples and the obtained results are compared with the known numerical and experimental ones. It is concluded that the presented programme and numerical model can be effectively used in nonlinear analysis of reinforced and prestressed concrete structures...|$|E
40|$|Just after World-War II {{building}} materials were scarce, architects and engineers had to design buildings using not much cement and steel. In French an architect, Jacques Couëlle, had invented {{a system with}} céramique infill elements to reduce for structures of concrete the self-weight and need of cement and steel. In the fifties and sixties {{of the twentieth century}} these céramique elements, known as Fusée Céramique elements, were used widely in France, North Africa and the Netherlands, mostly for barrel vaults and shells. Nowadays most of these structures are pulled down and the remaining buildings do not meet the demands of the present concerning climate comfort, insulation and safety. This thesis analyses the structural design of cylindrical Fusée Céramique roofs in the context of those days. The effect of the céramique infill elements for the time dependent deformations, stiffness and load bearing capacity, including second order, is studied. To save the few remaining buildings for the coming generations the possibilities to strengthen these structures with slender light elements of steel are explored. The effect of the strengthening is described for a Fusée Céramique vault, designed and constructed in the past. Reinforced concrete is a widely used building material with many advantages. Unfortunately the production of both reinforcement and cement is quite energy intensive and causes the emission of greenhouse gasses as NO 2, NO and CO 2. Reducing the need of cement is a relative simple way to reduce the emission of these greenhouse gasses. In practice roofs are seldom really flat but curved or at least slightly inclined, to drain rainwater and snow. Structurally curved structures, transferring loads as a surface-active or form-active structural system, are very efficient. The need of material and the self-weight is pretty low. This can be very useful if in the future the potentials of roofs for producing food and energy are used more often and these roofs must be designed for much heavier payloads as usual at the present. For form-active and surface-active roofs of concrete the self-weight and need of steel and cement can be reduced further with light infill elements. This study of the Fusée Céramique system shows that infill elements can save cement, self-weight and reduce the environmental load. The possibilities to save cement and reduce the environmental load with infill elements are studied with respect to the construction techniques of the present. The design of prefabricated cylindrical vaults, composed of segments following a part of a circle and strengthened with slender ties of steel to reduce the bending stresses, is described. To produce prefabricated cylindrical barrel vaults efficiently a positioning of tubes perpendicular to the span is preferable. The effect of this infill concerning the load transfer is analysed. Models of a <b>prefabricated</b> <b>element,</b> with tubes positioned perpendicular to the span, are tested to define the structural bearing capacity of prefabricated barrel vaults...|$|E

40|$|Esta dissertaÃÃo tem como objetivo {{investigar}} os fluxos de materiais e informaÃÃes entre os atores da cadeia de suprimento de portas prontas de madeira. Apesar de a literatura nacional apresentar estudos sobre o mapeamento de cadeias de suprimento na construÃÃo civil, poucos estudos abordam o tema para cadeias de suprimento localizadas na regiÃo Nordeste do paÃs. Essa cadeia de suprimento foi selecionada inicialmente com base em pesquisas realizadas pelo Grupo de Pesquisa e Assessoria em Gerenciamento na ConstruÃÃo Civil (GERCON) em que as esquadrias de madeira de empreendimentos habitacionais de interesse social foram apontadas como um produto problemÃtico. Partindo dessas pesquisas e buscando entender e solucionar os problemas por elas encontrados, esta dissertaÃÃo tem como foco a cadeia de suprimento de portas prontas de madeira que se apresentam como uma alternativa Ãs portas convencionais montadas na obra. As portas prontas de madeira tÃm todos os seus componentes prÃ-montados pelo fornecedor, o que teoricamente reduz a quantidade de atividades realizadas no canteiro de obras e, consequentemente, o tempo de instalaÃÃo das mesmas. Foram conduzidos estudos de casos em um empreendimento residencial e em um empreendimento comercial que adotavam o sistema de portas prontas. Mapas de fluxo de valor foram elaborados com base na observaÃÃo direta do processo de fabricaÃÃo e instalaÃÃo das esquadrias (visitas a fÃbrica da madeireira e ao canteiro de obras), registro fotogrÃfico e entrevistas com os diversos profissionais das empresas que fazem parte desta cadeia. EvidÃncias sugerem que as vantagens dos elementos prÃ-fabricados foram perdidas devido Ã falta de integraÃÃo entre os empreiteiros e fornecedores. A falta de troca de informaÃÃes entre os dois lados impediu uma utilizaÃÃo mais eficiente dos elementos prÃ-fabricados e a falta de padronizaÃÃo da espessura das paredes de alvenaria e tolerÃncias resultou em uma sÃrie de soluÃÃes de qualidade inferior durante a fase de instalaÃÃo. This masterâs thesis {{investigated the}} flows {{of material and}} information among participants of the supply chain of pre-fabricated wooden doors. The Brazilian literature on the topic presents different studies on supply chain mapping, however, few of them discuss issues related to supply chains on the countryâs Northeastern region. The supply chain investigated was choosen based on previous research projects {{carried out by the}} Grupo de Pesquisa e Assessoria em Gerenciamento na ConstruÃÃo Civil (GERCON), a construction management research group at the Federal University of CearÃ, Brazil. Previous studies carried out by GERCON researchers, on low-income housing projects, had revealed numerous problems related to wooden doors and windows. Using the results of previous studies as a starting point, this thesis studied the pre-fabricated wooden doors and their supply chain which have all of its components pre-assembled by the supplier. The use of pre-fabricated wooden doors would theoretically reduce the number of activities performed at the construction site, and would result in a shorter installation time. The two-phase research comprised a preliminary study and two in-depth case studies about pre-fabricated wooden doors. The author carried out the case studies in two high rising buildings (one residential and one commercial) in the city of Fortaleza, Brazil, in order to investigate the supply chain of pre-fabricated wooden doors. Value stream maps were developed based on direct observation of the processes involved to fabricate and install the product at the supplierâs plant and the construction site respectively, photos, and interviews with different professionals at the plant and at the site. Wooden doors presented problems related to the installation and final product quality regardless of the type of project. Some advantages of prefabricated elements were lost due lack of trust between contractors and suppliers, lack of consideration of preconditions necessary for successful site installation, and lack of standardization and tolerance management resulted in suboptimal solutions during the installation phase. Special attention should be paid to the interfaces between the <b>prefabricated</b> <b>element</b> and the other parts of the project, current means and methods should be revisited if the project is to fully take advantage of prefabrication. The lack of open communication and low levels of trust amongst the supply chain actors result in enormous amounts of waste (e. g., rework, wasted time, unnecessary handling, unnecessary use of resources) and diminished value to the client...|$|E
40|$|The Meuse in the Netherlands is {{since the}} 1920 s dammed by 7 weirs, which are located near Borgharen, Linne, Roermond, Belfeld, Sambeek, Grave and Lith. The weirs {{regulate}} the water {{levels in the}} canal sections (=stuwpanden) to provide sufficient depth for navigation. The management of the weirs is regulated by water level measurements at Maastricht St. Pieter (formerly Borgharen). The weirs dam the river for discharges lower than 1200 m 3 /s. For higher discharges the weirs are completely opened. Weir Linne is the oldest weir of the canalized Meuse and {{is part of the}} smallest canal section (=kanaalpand) of the Meuse. The weir consists just like the weirs of Roermond, Belfeld and Sambeek of two parts, a rough discharge regulating Poirée part and a accurate regulating Stoney part. Weir Linne maintains a water level of 20. 80 m +NAP in the upper canal section. The canal section forms a navigable interchange between the Juliana Kanaal, Lateraal Kanaal, Kanaal Wessem-Nederweert and canal section Roermond. The weirs in the Dutch part of the Meuse have been constructed for a period between 80 and 100 years. The weirs are approaching the end of their lifetime in the period between 2020 and 2030. In this situation is not spoken about design lifetime because in the period when the weirs were constructed the design lifetime was not defined. Based on maintenance reports and inspections it is concluded that the weirs are not able to fulfill their functions properly, they need to be replaced or upgraded. The main reasons for replacement or upgrading are technical and functional aging and changing legislations. According to Rijkswaterstaat the weir of Linne has ended its lifespan in the year 2030. Aging of materials and changes in the ARBO legislations are issues of the weir. This conclusions is the result of inspections and analyzes over several years. Besides aging of materials also aging in functionality contributes to the decrease of the weir quality. The functionality of the weirs has been changed in time due to changing conditions, in the RINK project called "new risks". These functional changes can have their causes in changes of design assumptions, maintenance, usability and controllability or law and regulations. The weir of Linne has to deal with the risks of changing discharges, ASR degradation, operability and the weir does not meet the ARBO regulations. This graduation report is focused on the problems of weir of Linne. The aim of this thesis research is to improve the situation of weir Linne for the future situation by replacing of upgrading the weir. The weir should meet the requirements based on discharge and navigational purposes in the future. This report is made up at four scale levels, the problem is approached from a high scale level to lower scale levels. The levels are made up according to the elementary design cycle. The first scale level concerns the canalized Meuse in the Netherlands. Because canal section Linne is relatively small It is investigated if it is possible to remove weir Linne instead of renewing or upgrading of the weir. The second scale level focuses on canal section Linne. In this section the effect of the Maasplassen with respect to the water level changes of the canal section is investigated for high and low discharges. Also the effect of the water level changes to the weir management is investigated to obtain a clear view about the reaction time of weir operations with regard to opening and closure of the weir. The third design level concerns the construction of weir Linne. It is considered if according to the RINK reports the current weir construction should be renewed or upgraded. The chapter proceeds with a rough analysis about the required width and retaining height of the weir to obtain if the discharge capacity of the current weir is sufficient for the future. It is decided to upgrade the Poirée part of the weir, the last part of this design level concerns the determination of a new gate type for the Poirée part of the weir. The lowest design level is focusing on the design of the new weir gate. The gate is designed in high strength concrete. The dimensions of the gate elements are determined and the gate is checked to the requirements according to Eurocode 2. The last section of the lowest design level concerns the way of placing and connecting the new gate to the current construction. The result of the first design level is that abolishing canal section Linne by combining the canal section with the upstream or downstream canal sections is not advisable. Weir and weir section Linne should be maintained in the future. This hold also for the other canal sections of the Meuse corridor except for canal section Lith. Because this canal section is the most downstream section in the Meuse canalization and far away from Linne, interventions to this canal section would have no effect on weir and canal section Linne. However the result holds for the current layout of the Meuse corridor. If a new layout should be proposed for the canalization of the Meuse it should be analyzed if weir Linne should be maintained or removed. The Maasplassen have a damping effect on the water level changes in canal section Linne. The damping effect is the effect of the relation between the changing discharge with respect to the water level changes in the canal section. Due to the Maasplassen the water level changes develop more slowly compared to a situation without the Maasplassen. This {{is the result of the}} storage capacity of the Maasplassen. The damping effect of the Maasplassen is most preferable and effective during low discharges. Navigational dept is maintained for a longer period because the water level decrease proceeds slowly due to the connected lakes. The discharge accuracy of the weir is not sufficient for the small discharges in the future, to maintain the navigable depth during low discharges the discharge accuracy should be increased. The damping has less effect on extreme high discharges compared to low discharges. Because the canal section is relatively small the water level rise will be relatively quick regardless of the damping effect of the Maasplassen. An increase of the storage capacity of the Maasplassen has a minor influence on this effect. However, the banks and retention areas are omitted in the analysis of the effects of the Maasplassen to the water level changes in canal section Linne. The results are not exact however, relative to each other the variants do represent a clear view about the effect of the Maasplassen to the water level changes. The opening procedure shorter than 8 hours is reliable after high discharges are measured at measure point Maastricht St. Pieter. Investigations on running times of flood waves on the Meuse have been done are not valid any more. Due to the Grensmaasproject running times for food waves will change. It is not advisable according to the RINK (=Risico Inventarisatie Natte Kunstwerken) report to replace the total weir of Linne at the moment. It is advised to monitor the condition of the weir until the period 2030 - 2035 and to take after this period a final decision. After this period a decision should be made to replace the or maintain the current weir for a longer period. In this report is concluded to maintain the current weir construction instead constructing a new weir. Due to over dimensioning the concrete super construction is a robust construction. The upgrade of the current weir will be done by the removal of the Poirée gates and constructing a new gate on the old Poirée part. The Poirée gate does not meet the requirements according to the ARBO legislations and the gate is not able to be remote controlled. The new type of weir that is chose to replace the old Poirée gates is the inflatable flap gate. The flap gate is able to retain a the required water level, able to close the old Poirée part without large reconstruction of the weir. The gate fulfills (when properly designed) the ARBO legislations and is able to be remote controlled. The flap gate is designed in concrete class C 90 / 105, this is a high strength concrete. High strength concrete is a durable construction material and requires less maintenance compared to steel constructions, especially in wet environments. The gate will be supported three air filled bladders, the bladders are placed next to each other. The concrete construction meets the requirements according to Eurocode 2. The checks of reinforcement, cracks and moment of failure are done for bending moments and shear resulting of loads perpendicular to the gate. Torsion due to for example failure of bladders is not taken into account. Checks to the concrete gate with regard to moments, cracks and failure due to torsion moments are also not taken into account. The gate will be placed as a <b>prefabricated</b> <b>element.</b> The element contains the gate, bladder, chain and supporting bottom plate. The plate is on upstream side placed at the rotation notches of the former Poirée gates and on the downstream side to the weir bottom. The gate could be further optimized, optimization could be done by for example reducing of the gate weight and curving the gate to increase the discharge capacity.

40|$|Though {{the use of}} <b>prefabricated</b> <b>elements</b> in {{construction}} has been considered {{as one of the}} most effective methods, the industry has found difficulties implementing it. The paper provided an overview of the challenges and factors influencing the use of prefabrication in Lagos state. A survey technique was adopted in carrying out this research. This paper studied 100 prefabricated home owners and occupants, and 25 professionals with knowledge and skill in the construction of prefabricated buildings in Lagos state. Two different questionnaires were administered, one to prefab building occupants/clients and the other was administered to professionals in the prefab industry survey based on 5 -likert scale. Statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) was used to process and analyze the data obtained from the questionnaires. The use of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>elements</b> in building construction is observed to be an effective and efficient approach to improving construction processes and productivity, ensuring construction quality and reducing time and cost in the construction industry. However, many problems occur with this approach in practice, including initial high cost of construction, unawareness of the prefabricated method of construction, unavailability of prefabrication companies locally, technically and challenges in installation. The study concluded that though there are lots of factors influencing the use of this method of construction, the benefits should be put into effective use. The use of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>elements</b> in building construction in Lagos state is profitable due to the benefit of faster construction time because of the nature of the city and the increasing population of the city. Recommendations were provided to further the use of the prefabricated method of construction more effectively...|$|R
