5|$|During the November to May dry season, <b>power</b> <b>output</b> {{is limited}} by the river's flow rate, as seen in the {{diagrams}} on the right. When there is enough flow, <b>power</b> <b>output</b> {{is limited by}} plant generating capacity. The maximum power-output curves were calculated based on the average flow rate at the dam site, assuming the water level is 175m and the plant gross efficiency is 90.15%. The actual <b>power</b> <b>output</b> in 2008 was obtained based on the monthly electricity sent to the grid.|$|E
5|$|Each {{ship had}} seven 1,000 kW ship service turbogenerators (SSTG) {{as well as}} two 200 kW {{emergency}} diesel generators. Total electrical <b>power</b> <b>output</b> was 7,000 kW at 450 volts alternating current.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, the {{nameplate}} {{capacity of a}} photovoltaic power stations is rated in megawatt-peak (MWp), which refers to the solar array's DC <b>power</b> <b>output.</b> However, Canada, Japan, Spain and {{some parts of the}} United States often specify using the converted lower nominal <b>power</b> <b>output</b> in MWAC; a measure directly comparable to other forms of power generation. A third and less common rating is the mega volt-amperes (MVA). Most solar parks are developed at a scale of at least 1MWp. As at the start of 2017, the world's largest operating photovoltaic power station has a capacity of over 800 megawatts and projects up to 1 gigawatt are planned. As at the end of 2016, about 4,300 projects with a combined capacity of 96GWAC were solar farms larger than 4MWAC.|$|E
40|$|The burner, a {{piece of}} "cooking equipment", {{operates}} {{in a wide range}} of <b>power</b> <b>outputs.</b> Contrary to expectations, it generated a much higher level of noise at lower <b>power</b> <b>outputs</b> than at higher <b>power</b> <b>outputs.</b> At lower <b>power</b> <b>outputs,</b> a fluctuating flame regime existed both inside the combustion chamber and the pre-heating chamber, which did not occur at higher <b>power</b> <b>outputs.</b> Using detailed noise measurements and spectral analysis plus acoustic modeling, the problem was identified as a self-excited combustion oscillations (SECO). Therefore, the remedy was to decouple the acoustic pressure and the unsteady heat release through design modifications. This posed a challenging task. This paper presents our understanding of the SECO in terms of noise spectra, dominant acoustic resonance frequencies and the corresponding acoustic pressure mode shapes by means of this burner. More specially, an effective remedy technique is proposed and its successful application to suppressing the SECO of this burner is demonstrated and analyzed...|$|R

5|$|Several {{explanations}} for the observed elevated temperatures and the resulting plumes have been proposed, including venting from a subsurface reservoir of liquid water, sublimation of ice, decompression and dissociation of clathrates, and shear heating, but a complete explanation of all the heat sources causing the observed thermal <b>power</b> <b>output</b> of Enceladus {{has not yet been}} settled.|$|E

Hybrid systems are most often found on islands.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{power was}} {{supplied}} to the ships by five electricity plants. Each plant consisted of four diesel generators and eight turbo-generators. The four diesel generators {{were divided into}} pairs: two provided 150kilowatts each and two supplied 300kW each. The eight turbo-generators were also of mixed capacity; six ran supplied 460kW each and the remaining two provided 230kW each. Total <b>power</b> <b>output</b> was 4,120kW at 220volts.|$|E
5|$|Most Solar {{parks are}} ground mounted PV systems, {{also known as}} {{free-field}} solar power plants. They can either be fixed tilt or use a single axis or dual axis solar tracker. While tracking improves the overall performance, it also increases the system's installation and maintenance cost. A solar inverter converts the array's <b>power</b> <b>output</b> from DC to AC, and connection to the utility grid is made through a high voltage, three phase step up transformer of typically 10kV and above.|$|E

5|$|The USB 3.0 {{specification}} {{was published}} on 12 November 2008. Its main goals were {{to increase the}} data transfer rate (up to 5Gbit/s), decrease power consumption, increase <b>power</b> <b>output,</b> and be backward compatible with USB 2.0. USB 3.0 includes a new, higher speed bus called SuperSpeed in parallel with the USB 2.0 bus. For this reason, the new version is also called SuperSpeed. The first USB 3.0 equipped devices were presented in January 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} underpinnings {{are based}} on the mainstream VE Commodore models of the same years. The car is powered by GM's 6.2-litre LS3 V8 engine, with a maximum <b>power</b> <b>output</b> of 442 PS (325kW). Buyers have the option of a six-speed manual transmission or six-speed automatic transmission; the manual is capable of reaching 0–100km/h (0–62mph) in 5.5 seconds and the automatic is capable of 0–100km/h (0–62mph) in 5.6 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{observed}} <b>power</b> <b>output</b> of 4.7 gigawatts {{is challenging}} to explain from tidal heating alone, so {{the main source}} of heat remains a mystery. Most scientists think the observed heat flux of Enceladus is not enough to maintain the subsurface ocean, and therefore any subsurface ocean must be a remnant of a period of higher eccentricity and tidal heating, or the heat is produced through another mechanism.|$|E

50|$|In a gear train, {{backlash}} is cumulative. When a gear-train {{is reversed}} the driving gear is turned a short distance, {{equal to the}} total of all the backlashes, before the final driven gear begins to rotate. At low <b>power</b> <b>outputs,</b> backlash results in inaccurate calculation from the small errors introduced at each change of direction; at large <b>power</b> <b>outputs</b> backlash sends shocks through the whole system and can damage teeth and other components.|$|R
5|$|Voyager 1 {{has three}} {{radioisotope}} thermoelectric generators (RTGs) {{mounted on a}} boom. Each MHW-RTG contains 24 pressed plutonium-238 oxide spheres. The RTGs generated about 470 W of electric power {{at the time of}} launch, with the remainder being dissipated as waste heat. The <b>power</b> <b>output</b> of the RTGs declines over time (due to the 87.7-year half-life of the fuel and degradation of the thermocouples), but the craft's RTGs will continue to support some of its operations until 2025.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{designed}} to be used with the QUAD II, 303, or 405 power amplifiers with limiters, a power amplifier capable of delivering 15 watts per channel suffices – excessive voltage input is known to cause arcing within the speaker panels. In fact, the instructions book states that any properly-regulated amplifier delivering no more than 33V is unlikely to cause damage to the speaker. Electrostatic speakers are more accurately rated by voltage, not power. In the ESL's case, at the rated nominal impedance of 16 ohms, the limit of 33 volts would be reached when the amplifier's <b>power</b> <b>output</b> reaches 15 watts (if it were driving a conventional load).|$|E
5|$|GE has {{installed}} a prototype wind turbine with onboard battery {{similar to that}} of an electric car, equivalent of 1 minute of production. Despite the small capacity, it is enough to guarantee that <b>power</b> <b>output</b> complies with forecast for 15 minutes, as the battery is used to eliminate the difference rather than provide full output. In certain cases the increased predictability can be used to take wind power penetration from 20 to 30 or 40 per cent. The battery cost can be retrieved by selling burst power on demand and reducing backup needs from gas plants.|$|E

30|$|Due to the {{uncertainty}} and intermittency of wind power, when the dispatched power {{is less than}} the actual minimum <b>output</b> <b>power,</b> the <b>output</b> <b>power</b> of wind farm will be constant; when the predicted average <b>output</b> <b>power</b> is greater than the actual average <b>output</b> <b>power,</b> there will be a transient power sag; when the predicted average <b>output</b> <b>power</b> is between the actual average <b>output</b> <b>power</b> and the actual minimum <b>output</b> <b>power,</b> there may be a power sag which is related to the wind conditions. During power system restoration, a transient power sag represents uncertainty: it is difficult to precisely predict the start time and the duration of transient power sags. Therefore, it’s necessary to optimize the dispatched power to ensure the security of the restored system.|$|R
5|$|On {{an early}} test run the R engine {{produced}} 1,400hp (1,040kW) and was noted to idle happily at 450revolutions per minute (rpm). With increased boost ratings and fuel developed by Banks, the R engine ultimately developed 2,530hp (1,890kW) at 3,200rpm; well over double the maximum <b>power</b> <b>output</b> of the Buzzard. The engine was further tested and cleared for limited sprint racing at 2,783hp (2,075kW) at 3,400rpm and +21lb (1.45bar) of boost, but this capability {{was not used}} due to concerns with the S.6B's airframe {{not being able to}} withstand the power, and the inability of the aircraft to lift the extra fuel required to meet the increased consumption.|$|E
5|$|The system {{inverters}} typically provide <b>power</b> <b>output</b> at voltages of {{the order}} of 480 VAC. Electricity grids operate at much higher voltages {{of the order}} of tens or hundreds of thousands of volts, so transformers are incorporated to deliver the required output to the grid. Due to the long lead time, the Long Island Solar Farm chose to keep a spare transformer onsite, as transformer failure would have kept the solar farm offline for a long period. Transformers typically have a life of 25 to 75 years, and normally do not require replacement during the life of a photovoltaic power station.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the distal}} {{arm of the}} third {{axillary}} sclerite rotates upwards and inwards, so that finally its position is completely reversed. The anal veins are articulated with this sclerite {{in such a way}} that when it moves they are carried with it and become flexed over the back of the insect. Activity of the same muscle in flight affects the <b>power</b> <b>output</b> of the wing and so it is also important in flight control. In orthopteroid insects, the elasticity of the cuticle causes the vannal area of the wing to fold along the veins. Consequently, energy is expended in unfolding this region when the wings are moved to the flight position. In general, wing extension probably results from the contraction of muscles attached to the basalar sclerite or, in some insects, to the subalar sclerite.|$|E
