Unlike most Roman Catholic cathedra, the Cathedra of the See of Chicago is <b>plain</b> <b>and</b> <b>simple.</b> Its back contains three panels depicting the first Christian teachers: Christ in the center panel, Saint Peter to his right, and Saint Paul to his left.|$|E

In the sky, storm clouds appear on the left while a rainbow appears on the right, signifying the American Revolutionary War giving way to the peace and prosperity of the new United States after the 1783 Treaty of Paris. The medallion {{at the top of}} the chair shows the red, white, and blue colors of the American flag.|$|E
25|$|The Church of St John the Divine, {{designed}} by William Swinden Barber, was {{built as a}} mission church in 1892–1893 in the parish of St James, Chapelthorpe, Crigglestone, Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England. It is Grade II listed. It was funded by local benefactor Mary Mackie in memory of her husband. It is of Gothic Revival and Arts and Crafts design. The exterior is small, <b>plain</b> <b>and</b> <b>simple</b> and the interior is low church; nevertheless the interior contains a fine scissor-truss roof which retains its original 1892 stencil paintings. The church is still in commission as a shared benefice with the parish church of St James, Chapelthorpe.|$|E

25|$|Uthman was {{a family}} man who {{apparently}} led a simple life even after becoming the Caliph of the Rashidun Empire and regardless {{of the fact that}} he was rich due to his flourishing family business. The caliphs were paid for their services from bait al-mal, the public treasury, but Uthman never took any salary for his service as a Caliph, as he was independently wealthy. Uthman was also a humanitarian: He developed a custom to free slaves every Friday, look after the widows and orphans, and give unlimited charity. His patience and endurance were among the characteristics that made him a successful leader. As a way of taking care of Muhammad's wives, he doubled their allowances. Uthman wasn't completely <b>plain</b> <b>and</b> <b>simple,</b> however: Uthman built a Palace for himself in Medina, known as Al-Zawar, with a notable feature being doors of precious wood. Although Uthman paid for the palace with his own money, Shia Muslims considered it his first step towards ruling like a King.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the city}} was rebuilt in the <b>plain</b> <b>and</b> <b>simple</b> style of the 1950s and 1960s, but some of the {{historic}} landmark buildings have been restored. Due to its almost complete destruction in 1944, the Hirschstraße part {{of the city}} primarily consists of modern architecture. Ulm experienced substantial growth in the decades following World War II, with the establishment of large new housing projects and new industrial zones. In 1967, Ulm University was founded, which proved to be of great importance {{for the development of the}} city. Particularly since the 1980s, the transition from classical industry towards the high-tech sector has accelerated, with, for example, the establishment of research centres of companies like Daimler, Siemens and Nokia and a number of small applied research institutes near the university campus. The city today is still growing, forming a twin city of 170,000 inhabitants together with its neighbouring Bavarian city of Neu-Ulm, and seems to benefit from its central position between the cities of Stuttgart and Munich and thus between the cultural and economic hubs of southern Germany.|$|E

50|$|Console {{tables in}} Italy radically changed after the 1760s and 1770s. They were usually far <b>plainer</b> <b>and</b> more {{classical}} in style, with grand marble slabs and straight legs, which were often bulky and heavily decorated. But, {{at the same}} time, Venetian console tables were still mainly inspired by the Louis XV designs, but usually had <b>plainer</b> <b>and</b> <b>simpler</b> cabriole legs.|$|R

500|$|Odyssey Number Five was Powderfinger's {{shortest}} album when recorded, {{running for}} approximately 45 minutes. The {{focus of the}} album was on restraint, with more simplistic lyrics than previously, and with a <b>plain</b> <b>and</b> <b>simple</b> message intended. Fanning said of his songwriting ethic: [...] "You try and make it something that’s got some substance, but also, you can never do that {{at the cost of}} it having relevance to what you’re singing." [...] Powderfinger manager Paul Piticco commented that [...] "their ethos is to be pushing the limits of their songwriting ability".|$|E
500|$|Churches of Christ seek to {{practice}} {{the principle of the}} Bible being the only source to find doctrine (known elsewhere as sola scriptura). The Bible is generally regarded as inspired and inerrant. Churches of Christ generally see the Bible as historically accurate and literal, unless scriptural context obviously indicates otherwise. Regarding church practices, worship, and doctrine, there is great liberty from congregation to congregation in interpreting what is Biblically permissible, as congregations are not controlled by a denominational hierarchy. Their approach to the Bible is driven by the [...] "assumption that the Bible is sufficiently <b>plain</b> <b>and</b> <b>simple</b> to render its message obvious to any sincere believer". Related to this is an assumption that the Bible provides an understandable [...] "blueprint" [...] or [...] "constitution" [...] for the church.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} for Billboard {{noted that}} the song [...] "seems to toss {{her back to her}} Disney days". They concluded that: [...] "Pop music is always appreciated, but this is a kiddie anthem, <b>plain</b> <b>and</b> <b>simple</b> [...] it is hardly a contender for contemporary radio". Bill Lamb of About.com found the song, along with [...] "Break My Heart", to be [...] "disappointing cookie cutter copies" [...] of Avril Lavigne's [...] "Sk8er Boi". He stated that although the songs are [...] "easy to listen", they [...] "break no new ground". Gabriel Leong of MTV Asia stated that [...] "Beat of My Heart" [...] sounds [...] "very much like" [...] songs that Debbie Gibson, Tiffany and Bananarama would have recorded in 1980s, a direction that suits Duff [...] "much better than the whole budding rock chick image she's been trying out.

As with other Buddhist temples in the Hiraizumi area, the temple shared the Pure Land theme with a large pond surrounded by gardens. The pond was fed by a stream from Mōtsū-ji. Both Mōtsū-ji and Kanjizaiō-in also had large earthen walls surrounding their compounds with majestic entrance gates. Whereas the temple structures at Mōtsū-ji were elaborate and opulent, the buildings at Kanjizaiō-in were much <b>plainer</b> <b>and</b> <b>simpler.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{greatest}} {{influences in}} the 19th century that propelled [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] to {{spread across the}} U.S. and become a staple of religious services in many denominations and regions were the Second Great Awakening {{and the development of}} shape note singing communities. A tremendous religious movement swept the U.S. in the early 19th century, marked by the growth and popularity of churches and religious revivals that got their start in Kentucky and Tennessee. Unprecedented gatherings of thousands of people attended camp meetings where they came to experience salvation; preaching was fiery and focused on saving the sinner from temptation and backsliding. Religion was stripped of ornament and ceremony, and made as <b>plain</b> <b>and</b> <b>simple</b> as possible; sermons and songs often used repetition to get across to a rural population of poor and mostly uneducated people the necessity of turning away from sin. Witnessing and testifying became an integral component to these meetings, where a congregation member or even a stranger would rise and recount his turn from a sinful life to one of piety and peace. [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] was one of many hymns that punctuated fervent sermons, although the contemporary style used a refrain, borrowed from other hymns, that employed simplicity and repetition such as: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Beat of My Heart" [...] was {{released}} {{as the second}} single from Most Wanted on December 12, 2005. The song received generally negative reviews from critics, who labelled it repetitive. Chuck Taylor of Billboard wrote: [...] "Pop music is always appreciated, {{but this is a}} kiddie anthem, <b>plain</b> <b>and</b> <b>simple,</b> so repetitive and childlike [...] that is hardly a contender for contemporary radio." [...] The song failed to chart in the US, but was a moderate success elsewhere, peaking within the top 10 in Italy, and the top-twenty in Australia and Spain. The song's accompanying music video, directed by Phil Harder, was influenced by the opening title sequences of James Bond films, and Duff sports different looks inspired by the different eras of the Bond films. In a few European countries, [...] "Fly" [...] {{was released}} as the second single from Most Wanted on March 13, 2006. It charted and peaked at number 20 on the UK Singles Chart and number 13 on the Italian Singles Chart. A third single from the album was planned to be released, but due to Duff's busy schedule and exhaustion from touring, it did not materialize. Instead, [...] "Supergirl" [...] was released as a download-only single on February 28, 2006. [...] "Wake Up" [...] and [...] "Supergirl" [...] were also used in an advertisement campaign to promote Candie's' clothing line for young women in 2005–06.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{the video}} {{received}} general acclaim from critics and fans, and in 2010 {{it became the}} most-viewed video in YouTube history, up to that point. Tim Stack from Entertainment Weekly called the video [...] "amazing" [...] and added, [...] "I don't think Gaga has ever looked prettier than in the close-ups where she's more stripped down." [...] Jennifer Cady of E! was also impressed by the video and commented, [...] "This music video really makes us appreciate everything Gaga actually brings to pop music. She's exciting to watch, <b>plain</b> <b>and</b> <b>simple.</b> ... We need someone like Gaga to really bring it. To put actual thought and care into her product so that it feels alive". Issie Lapowsky of New York Daily News thought Gaga laid the [...] "theatrics on thick" [...] in the video but complimented her for wearing minimal makeup, calling it [...] "refreshingly normal". Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times said that the video brought back his faith in performance art, and that [...] "Gaga brings enough [...] on her own, thank you very much." [...] He also thought the set for the video [...] "worthy of a feature-length film". Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone felt that the scenes from the music video were reminiscent {{of the work of}} Stanley Kubrick. He added that in [...] "Bad Romance" [...] Gaga portrays her craziest ideas yet.|$|E

500|$|The Quakers {{emigrated to}} the New World from the {{northern}} English Midlands during the 17th century, and eventually settled primarily in the Delaware Valley. They were similar to the Puritans in the strictness that they applied to everyday life, though their religious teachings were far different. Their food was <b>plain</b> <b>and</b> <b>simple.</b> Excessive consumption was discouraged and failure to eat or drink moderately was punished with public acts of criticism. William Penn was the founder of Pennsylvania and an important figure {{in the development of}} the Quaker movement, and he encouraged frugality in his followers with advice such as, [...] "If thou rise with an appetite thou are sure never to sit down without one". The Quakers, like the Puritans, encountered an abundance of food in the New World: forests rich with game and berries, streams teeming with fish, and abundant flocks of birds. Still the asceticism persevered. Many Quakers avoided eating butter as a form of self-mortification, and the most eccentric followers would avoid tea and meat. The idealist and pacifist ideas of the Quakers also encouraged many to boycott products that were considered to be tainted by sin. This included butter, due to its role in raising war taxes, and coffee, because it was produced by slave labor. Eating habits were more egalitarian than those of either the Puritans or the Virginian Anglicans. At meals, entire households would dine at the same table, including children and servants.|$|E

The women looked very much pleased when they heard this.
