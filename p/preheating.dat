5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{existed in}} China from about 1st century AD {{and in the}} West from the High Middle Ages. They spread from the region around Namur in Wallonia (Belgium) in the late 15th century, being introduced to England in 1491. The fuel used in these was invariably charcoal. The successful substitution of coke for charcoal is widely attributed to Abraham Darby in 1709. The efficiency of the process was further enhanced by the practice of <b>preheating</b> the combustion air (hot blast), patented by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828.|$|E
5|$|Shallow penetration, another {{detriment}} to weld strength, can {{be addressed}} by decreasing welding speed, increasing the current or using a smaller electrode. Any of these weld-strength-related defects can make the weld prone to cracking, but other factors are involved as well. High carbon, alloy or sulfur content in the base material can lead to cracking, especially if low-hydrogen electrodes and <b>preheating</b> are not employed. Furthermore, the workpieces should not be excessively restrained, as this introduces residual stresses into the weld and can cause cracking as the weld cools and contracts.|$|E
5|$|In GMAW {{the primary}} cause of {{porosity}} is gas entrapment in the weld pool, which occurs when the metal solidifies before the gas escapes. The gas can come from impurities in the shielding gas or on the workpiece, as well as from an excessively long or violent arc. Generally, the amount of gas entrapped {{is directly related to the}} cooling rate of the weld pool. Because of its higher thermal conductivity, aluminum welds are especially susceptible to greater cooling rates and thus additional porosity. To reduce it, the workpiece and electrode should be clean, the welding speed diminished and the current set high enough to provide sufficient heat input and stable metal transfer but low enough that the arc remains steady. <b>Preheating</b> can also help reduce the cooling rate in some cases by reducing the temperature gradient between the weld area and the base material.|$|E
40|$|Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) is {{welding process}} that is used for welding steel such as ASTM A 283 C Steel.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, the {{fabrication}} {{of the desired}} SPR joints was investigated {{as a function of}} the <b>preheat</b> temperature and strain rate. To determine the optimum <b>preheat</b> temperature, Gleeble thermal analogue testing of 2 mm thick magnesium AZ 31 was used to assess the combined influence of <b>preheat</b> temperature and strain rate on the strength and total elongation of magnesium AZ 31. Magnesium alloy AZ 31 with a thickness of 2 mm was <b>preheated</b> with various temperatures prior to self-piercing riveting. The appearances, cross-sections and mechanical tests of the SPR magnesium AZ 31 joints were investigated. It was found that a <b>preheat</b> temperature of 180 to 200 o C largely eliminated the cracking in magnesium AZ 31 joints. The joint strength increases with increasing <b>preheat</b> temperature from ambient to 200 o C. The strength increase is attributed to the reduction in joint cracking and an increase in mechanical interlock between the rivet and work pieces...|$|R

40|$|Home heating is a {{major factor}} in {{worldwide}} energy use. Our system, <b>PreHeat,</b> aims to more efficiently heat homes by using occupancy sensing and occupancy prediction to automatically control home heating. We deployed <b>PreHeat</b> in five homes, three in the US and two in the UK. In UK homes, we controlled heating on a per-room basis to enable further energy savings. We compared <b>PreHeat’s</b> prediction algorithm with a static program over an average 61 days per house, alternating days between these conditions, and measuring actual gas consumption and occupancy. In UK homes <b>PreHeat</b> both saved gas and reduced MissTime (the time that the house was occupied but not warm).

25|$|Unglazed transpired {{collectors}} are perforated sun-facing walls {{used for}} <b>preheating</b> ventilation air. Transpired collectors {{can also be}} roof mounted for year-round use and can raise the incoming air temperature up to 22°C and deliver outlet temperatures of 45-60°C. The short payback period of transpired collectors (3 to 12years) make them a more cost-effective alternative to glazed collection systems. As of 2015, over 4000 systems with a combined collector area of 500,000 m2 had been installed worldwide. Representatives include an 860 m2 collector in Costa Rica used for drying coffee beans and a 1300 m2 collector in Coimbatore, India used for drying marigolds.|$|E
25|$|For cutting, {{the setup}} {{is a little}} different. A cutting torch has a 60- or 90-degree angled head with {{orifices}} placed around a central jet. The outer jets are for preheat flames of oxygen and acetylene. The central jet carries only oxygen for cutting. The use of several <b>preheating</b> flames rather than a single flame {{makes it possible to}} change the direction of the cut as desired without changing the position of the nozzle or the angle which the torch makes with the direction of the cut, as well as giving a better preheat balance. Manufacturers have developed custom tips for Mapp, propane, and polypropylene gases to optimize the flames from these alternate fuel gases.|$|E
30|$|However, {{temperatures}} at locations C 2 and C 3 of the <b>preheated</b> specimens {{are higher}} than those of non-preheated specimens. This is because heat is prevented from being transferred from the fire toward the opposite surface due to moisture clog inside the walls when the specimens are not <b>preheated.</b> In other words, <b>preheated</b> walls have little or no moisture clog, which leads to a better heat transfer through the thickness of the walls.|$|R

25|$|Friction {{extrusion}} {{was invented}} at The Welding Institute in the UK and patented in 1991. It was originally intended {{primarily as a}} method for production of homogenous microstructures and particle distributions in metal matrix composite materials. Friction extrusion differs from conventional extrusion in that the charge (billet or other precursor) rotates relative to the extrusion die. An extrusion force is applied so as to push the charge against the die. In practice either the die or the charge may rotate {{or they may be}} counter-rotating. The relative rotary motion between the charge and the die has several significant effects on the process. First, the relative motion in the plane of rotation leads to large shear stresses, hence, plastic deformation in the layer of charge in contact with and near the die. This plastic deformation is dissipated by recovery and recrystallization processes leading to substantial heating of the deforming charge. Because of the deformation heating, friction extrusion does not generally require <b>preheating</b> of the charge by auxiliary means potentially resulting in a more energy efficient process. Second, the substantial level of plastic deformation in the region of relative rotary motion can promote solid state welding of powders or other finely divided precursors, such as flakes and chips, effectively consolidating the charge (friction consolidation) prior to extrusion.|$|E
500|$|For GTAW {{of carbon}} and {{stainless}} steels, {{the selection of}} a filler material is important to prevent excessive porosity. Oxides on the filler material and workpieces must be removed before welding to prevent contamination, and immediately prior to welding, alcohol or acetone should be used to clean the surface. <b>Preheating</b> is generally not necessary for mild steels less than one inch thick, but low alloy steels may require <b>preheating</b> to slow the cooling process and prevent the formation of martensite in the heat-affected zone. [...] Tool steels should also be preheated to prevent cracking in the heat-affected zone. Austenitic stainless steels do not require <b>preheating,</b> but martensitic and ferritic chromium stainless steels do. A DCEN power source is normally used, and thoriated electrodes, tapered to a sharp point, are recommended. Pure argon is used for thin workpieces, but helium can be introduced as thickness increases.|$|E

This study discusses {{the values of}} {{equivalent dose}} (De) determined for samples taken for optical dating from a loess section at Loveland, Iowa, North America. A modified single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) procedure was applied to quartz grains of 35 ?View the MathML source diameter which were isolated using hydrofluorosilicic acid (H 2 SiF 6). ?<b>Preheat</b> plots? were constructed to select appropriate De values for use in subsequent age determinations.
