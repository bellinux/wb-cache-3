A dropping mercury electrode {{was used as the}} working electrode. UV/VIS spectrophotometric detection was used for comparison to electrochemical detection, the walenghts used were 308 nm and 388 nm. Optimal pH conditions were determined for determination using TP, DPP and UV/VIS spectrophotometry. The calibration dependences were measured using the found optimal conditions and limits of quantification, and limits of detection were determined. Limit of quantification for aclonifen were found to be 3, 4 · 10 - 6 mol·L- 1 using TP; 2, 2 · 10 - 7 mol·L- 1 using DPP and 4, 6 · 10 - 6 mol·L- 1 using UV/VIS spectrophotometry...|$|E

Tasks included feasibility studies for performing coulometric titration and <b>polarographic</b> <b>determinations</b> of oxygen in sodium, {{and the development of}} new separation techniques for sodium impurities and their subsequent analyses. The program was terminated ahead of schedule so firm conclusions were not obtained in all areas of the work. At least 40 coulometric titrations were carried out and special test cells were developed for coulometric application. Data indicated that polarographic measurements are theoretically feasible, but practical application of the method was not verified. An emission spectrographic procedure for trace metal impurities was developed and published. Trace metal analysis by a neutron activation technique was shown to be feasible; key {{to the success of the}} activation technique was the application of a new ion exchange resin which provided a sodium separation factor of 10 {sup 11 }.

The author studied the degradation process of penicillin by <b>polarographic</b> <b>determination</b> of SH group freed from penicillin in alkaline solution or by boiling. An ammoniacal buffer solution containing divalent cobalt (pH 9. 52) is used as the basic solution. Experimental data are as follows; 1) Penicillin in basic solution without any other treatment before <b>polarographic</b> <b>determination,</b> showed SH waves with wave heights increasing gradually. 2) When watery penicillin solution was stored at above room-temperature the penicillin decomposed at a relatively rapid rate. 3) Penicillin was decomposed by boiling showing SH waves.

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of misonidazole (MISO) and recombinant human tumour necrosis factor (rh-TNF) on tumour blood flow in mice given hyperthermic treatments. MISO (500 mg kg- 1) or rh-TNF (6 x 10 (4) unit kg- 1) was administered intraperitoneally (i. p.) prior to hyperthermia to nude mice bearing a xenoplanted human gastric cancer and tumour blood flow was measured by a hydrogen diffusion method based on <b>polarographic</b> <b>determinations.</b> MISO plus hyperthermia produced a temperature-dependent decrease in blood flow and, at 43. 5 degrees C, the flow decreased to 15 - 30 % of control and remained low for up to 24 h. Blood flow following rh-TNF plus hyperthermia was less than that at the same temperatures following MISO plus hyperthermia, and, at 43. 5 degrees C, the flow decreased to 10 - 20 % of control and remained low for up to 48 h. Tumour growth delay was closely related to the duration of the decrease in blood flow. Thus, the profound decrease in tumour blood flow following hyperthermia plus MISO or rh-TNF and the consequential tumour regression may well be of potential clinical significance...|$|R

40|$|The {{analytical}} {{application of}} a simple polarographic Row through cell, which was previously designed for the continuous polarographic analysis of organic compounds in pharmaceuticals and urine, is proposed in this work for the determination of copper in diluted water samples. The cell contains a conventional dropping mercury electrode (DME), a mercury pool and a platinum wire as the working, reference and counter electrodes, respectively Enrichment of the analyte, previous to the <b>polarographic</b> continuous <b>determination.</b> was necessary and was achieved by using a microcolumn containing Chelex- 100, located in the loop of the injection valve.

40|$|A <b>polarographic</b> oxygen <b>determination,</b> with {{tissue in}} {{direct contact with}} a {{stationary}} platinum electrode, has been used to measure the photosynthetic response of marine algae. These were exposed to monochromatic light, of equal energy, at some 35 points through the visible spectrum (derived from a monochromator). Ulva and Monostroma (green algae) show action spectra which correspond very closely to their absorption spectra. Coilodesme (a brown alga) shows almost as good correspondence, including the spectral region absorbed by the carotenoid, fucoxanthin. In green and brown algae, light absorbed by both chlorophyll and carotenoids seems photosynthetically effective, although some inactive absorption by carotenoids is indicated. Action spectra {{for a wide variety of}} red algae, however, show marked deviations from their corresponding absorption spectra. The photosynthetic rates are high in the spectral regions absorbed by the water-soluble "phycobilin" pigments (phycoerythrin and phycocyanin), while the light absorbed by chlorophyll and carotenoids is poorly utilized for oxygen production. In red algae containing chiefly phycoerythrin, the action spectrum closely resembles that of the water-extracted pigment, with peaks corresponding to its absorption maxima (495, 540, and 565 mµ). Such algae include Delesseria, Schizymenia, and Porphyrella. In the genus Porphyra, there is a series P. nereocystis, P. naiadum, and P. perforata, with increasingly more phycocyanin and less phycoerythrin: the action spectra reflect this, with increasing activity in the orange-red region (600 to 640 mµ) where phycocyanin absorbs. In all these red algae, photosynthesis is almost minimal at 435 mµ and 675 mµ, where chlorophyll shows maximum absorption. Although the chlorophylls (and carotenoids) are present in quantities comparable to the green algae, their function is apparently not that of a primary light absorber; this role is taken over by the phycobilins. In this respect the red algae (Rhodophyta) appear unique among photosynthetic plants...|$|R

Silver solid electrode (AgSAE) was developed as an alternative to mercury electrodes regarding legislative complications limitating usage of mercury because of its supposed toxicity. Properties of this electrode are very similar to the ones of mercury electrodes, mainly outstandingly broad cathodic potential region but excelent sensitivity either. As an electrode material, silver amalgam was used which non-toxicity is obvious given for example even by its long-term usage in stomatology as a main item for production of tooth-fillings. For model determination, Fomesafen was chosen because of its previous and sometimes also present usage as a major component of herbicid agents in agriculture. Its factual toxicity was actually proven and it was also classified as a potential carcinogen for humans.

40|$|Metal {{complexes}} of polyaminocarboxylic acids are {{of interest}} as contrast media for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Such metal complexes are stable and will therefore minimize the toxic effects of the free metal ions. Attention has been focused especially on the paramagnetic gadolinium(III) -, iron(III) - and manganese(II) -ions. The gadolinium complexes {{appear to be the}} most potent but the biological effects of the free metal are of some concern. In contrast the biological effects of iron are well known and iron(III) complexes are therefore of particularly interest as MRI contrast agents. In this study the iron(III) complexes of diethylenetrinitrilopentaacetic acid (DTPA), trans- 1, 2 -cyclohexylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid (CDTA), triethylenetetranitrilohexaacetic acid (TTHA) and ethyulenediiminobis(2 -hydroxyphenyl) acetic acid (EHPG) were investigated. The technique used was the electroanalytical method differential pulse polarography (DPP). This technique is particularly well suited to such studies because of its ability to discriminate between the free metal ion, the metal complex and the free ligand. The complexes of DTPA, CDTA and TTHA were found to decompose slowly at pH 7, 2. With TTHA a mixture of 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 complexes was obtained and the transformation between the two complexes was slow. EHPG was found to be the most suitable ligand.
