50|$|Whereas European signs {{usually have}} white {{background}} on warning and <b>prohibition</b> <b>signs,</b> Finnish signs have a yellow/orange colour. This {{is for the}} purpose of enhancing the visibility of the sign during the winter, as white signs would be hard to see in the snow. <b>Prohibition</b> <b>signs</b> displaying a symbol other than a numeric value have a diagonal red line across them. <b>Prohibition</b> <b>signs</b> in Slovenia and Sweden are similar in this respect. In most European countries, however, such signs do not usually include a red line.|$|R
50|$|Like other {{countries}} in Europe, Swedish signs follow the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals.Whereas European signs usually have white background on warning and <b>prohibition</b> <b>signs,</b> the Swedish signs have a yellow/orange colour. This is {{for the purpose of}} enhancing the visibility of the sign during the winter, as white signs would be hard to see in the snow. The <b>prohibition</b> <b>signs</b> have a red line across them if there is a symbol on them, not if it is a numeric value. General European <b>prohibition</b> <b>signs</b> do usually not have such a red line. Swedish warning and <b>prohibition</b> <b>signs</b> also have a thicker border than their European counterparts. Traffic signs in Slovenia and Finland are quite similar.|$|R

50|$|Direction signs {{can also}} be used in {{conjunction}} with other types of sign: for example, in the United Kingdom, if a warning or prohibitory sign appears on a direction sign, it means that the route indicated by the sign contains the hazard or <b>prohibition</b> <b>sign</b> posted.|$|E

Safety signs can {{alert the}} staff to {{dangerous}} situation of the workplace or the surrounding environment and guide people to take reasonable actions {{so as to avoid}} accidents and mitigate the consequences of accidents. But unreasonable and noncompliant problems exist in the safety signs at the mine entrances. So four kinds of <b>prohibition</b> <b>signs</b> and four kinds of instruction signs that meet the standard requirements at the mine entrances are determined and that one kind of <b>prohibition</b> <b>signs,</b> three kinds of warning signs and one kind of instruction signs can be placed at the mine entrances are explained.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the characteristics of construction personnel and their degree of recognition of safety signs and symbols. The safety signs and symbols are split into categories of mandatory action <b>signs,</b> <b>prohibition</b> <b>signs</b> and warning symbols. Thirty safety signs and symbols printed in colour and in Chinese were distributed to 560 construction personnel working in eight different construction sites in Hong Kong. The results drawn from 388 respondents indicate that substantial problems exist in comprehending the signs and symbols that are posted in construction sites. The percentages of construction personnel who correctly identified mandatory action <b>signs,</b> <b>prohibition</b> <b>signs</b> and warning symbols are 90 %, 61 % and 55 % respectively. Drinking habits, involvement in on-site safety promotion activities and their job positions play a determinant role in their ability of comprehending these construction safety symbols. These findings provide meaningful implications to the industry in the design, selection and positioning of safety symbols on site. Safety, signs, symbols, recognition, construction, personnel,...|$|R
40|$|Broken windows theory {{states that}} cues of {{inappropriate}} behavior like litter or graffiti amplify norm-violating behavior. In {{a series of}} quasi-experiments, Keizer, Lindenberg, and Steg altered cues of inappropriate behavior in public places and observed how many passersby subsequently violated norms. They concluded that particular norm violations transgress to other misdemeanors (e. g., graffiti leads to littering or even theft) and {{that the presence of}} <b>prohibition</b> <b>signs</b> heightens the saliency of norm violations, thereby aggravating the negative effects of cues such as litter and graffiti. We raise several methodological and statistical issues that cast doubt on Keizer et al. â€™s results. Problems include confounding factors, observer bias, lacking scoring protocols, a failure to establish interobserver reliabilities, inflated Type I error rates due to dependencies, sequential testing, and multiple testing. We highlight results of a highly similar study that does not support the notion that <b>prohibition</b> <b>signs</b> aggravate the effects of observed norm violations. We discuss potential improvements of the paradigm. Keywords: descriptive norms, littering behavior, methodological critique, statistics, thef...|$|R
50|$|There is a {{strictly}} protected sanctuary, a peninsula {{on the eastern}} coast of Cat Ba Island, in the National Park and supports about 40% of the population. Fixed boundaries were set with blocking buoys and <b>prohibition</b> <b>signs.</b> Another step taken was {{to increase the number}} of rangers in the area. Local citizens, especially fishermen, were informed and rangers were given permission to remove people and take away any poaching equipment they found. Any existing and potential caves and hunter trails are registered, regulated, and controlled.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} is shot in cut-out {{animation}} and depicts {{a man in}} shorts and a track singlet with a Crossbuster (Bad Religion's logo which features a black cross with a red <b>prohibition</b> <b>sign</b> over it) on it running through a burning, apocalyptic Los Angeles.

Frontman Greg Graffin plays a psychotic newsreporter who reads messages like [...] "Panic & Fear Widespread; Retail Up 25%", [...] "Four Horsemen Back In Saddle" [...] and [...] "You are not being brainwashed". Right before the guitar solo, the man shown running through the city burns when the flames catch {{up to him and}} the video transitions to the band playing the song among all the chaos in the city, before they burn too. At the end of the video, the entire city goes up in flames moments after Graffin does.|$|E
40|$|Warnings {{are used}} to inform users of hazards that may be {{associated}} with many products. Often these warnings deal with the operation of tools, appliances, and other items for which the user may have some reason at least, to look for information on the product regarding its use. Plastic film presents a serious hazard to young children. Because the film will adhere to the flesh, if it covers the airways for the child, suffocation may result. Because young children may play with them, it is important that such films be kept away from them. Warnings need to be adequate to inform or remind caregivers of this fact. This study examined warnings found on various items in commerce and some alternatives to those warnings. The results showed some warnings to be poor at best. The alternative most preferred included both the <b>prohibition</b> <b>sign</b> and a symbolic indication of proper disposal...|$|E
40|$|Genre: Medicine/huru. Petrus Hase {{explained}} his 'huru tithi' around noon time 26 Sept 2015 in kampong Sali, {{where we had}} gone looking for 'huru' that day. Symptoms: pain in stomach. Cure: Hase cures (with chewed areca nut, piper betel, lime). The <b>prohibition</b> <b>sign</b> is made from 'tithi' plant and five 'ci'i' (longgrass), braided in a circle. The circle is pierced with two sharpened 'hao' (a bamboo) sticks, left right, then pierce {{with a piece of}} wood too, left right (= four directions). Then hang the sign by the cassaca plantation (for instance). If somebody has dug and taken cassava without pernission, suspected from the traces of digging, roots are brought back home ('nala tetu huru tithi'), to be grilled in fire from dried coconut shell. Then the ashes are brought back to the plantation, and Hase commands that the thief be punished. Then apply the prepared mixture with paddy grains, laid with 'ci'i' at the navel (5, 5 times spit). Simple 'bulu wao'. The patient usually 'peju', pays something, little money. This is more safe. And he/she may also 'siko',do the healing ritual that dispose of the bad and bring the good, witha coin. Recorded by SD and Pidhu (Ebbe) with an AT Lavelier mic. With Lunda, who also told his 'huru', and a few family members; Ware, Lunda (another), Pethu (Petrus?), children Wua, Dhoka, Cawa. Photo, Hase at center, at Lunda's house. Notes: tithi, siâ€™i, siwe (neâ€™e tetu lae lekhe). (huru tithi. PH). Curse: circular sign braided from tithi and pierced with wood. Cure: Lay siâ€™i and 5 siwe grains at navel, the siwe five times, one spit per paddy grain. When the patient feels well, it is time for ngiru siko (healing, reconciliation ritual) with siwe, bulu wao. Palu'e, Flores, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Indonesia.

The approach detects the sign in the image by color processing and multi-layer perceptron neural network.

It is important to examine also the text label passo-carrabile as an additional test and to differentiate this specific sign among all other <b>prohibition</b> <b>signs.</b> The obtained results show the feasibility of the system. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Prohibition</b> <b>signs</b> warn {{of actions}} {{considered}} dangerous or annoying. Typically, these signs are {{located near the}} beginning of their scope, but knowledge about applicable prohibitions is important at any place within the scope. We developed an automated method to determine the scope of signs, aiming to support volunteered geographic information (VGI) applications that wish to capture prohibitions. In this paper we investigate the problem of computing the scope of geo-referenced signs that refer to human outdoor activities using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. We analyze the problem and discuss the specific challenges faced. From the analysis we derive a symbolic representation that links activities with (OSM) map features, enabling semantic assessment of map features with respect to a prohibition and reasoning to infer its scope. In a comparative evaluation we demonstrate that our spatial-semantic approach significantly outperforms a previous method based on proximity...|$|R
