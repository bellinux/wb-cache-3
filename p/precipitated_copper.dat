5000|$|Similar to the Anglo-Saxon {{method for}} cupellation, the Chinese {{employed}} {{the use of}} a base metal to extract the target metal from its impurities. First, the base metal, iron, is hammered into thin sheets. The sheets are then placed into a trough filled with “vitriol water” i.e., copper mining water which is then left to steep for several day. The mining water contains copper salts in the form of copper sulfate [...] The iron then reacts with the copper, displacing it from the sulfate ions, causing the copper to precipitate onto the iron sheets, forming a [...] "wet" [...] powder. Finally, the <b>precipitated</b> <b>copper</b> is collected and refined further through the traditional smelting process. This is the first large-scale use of a hydrometallurgical process.|$|E

One was a novel acidophilic sulfate-reducing bacterium (isolate CL 4) that grew at pH 3. 0 and above using glycerol as electron donor, {{and the other}} was the type strain of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans which was grown at pH 2. 5 using hydrogen (derived from dissolution of metallic iron) as electron donor and elemental sulfur as electron acceptor. Both bacteria were grown in pH-controlled bioreactors. Isolate CL 4 mediated the selective precipitation of zinc in situ, while the At. ferrooxidans bioreactor operated as an off-line system, generating hydrogen sulfide that <b>precipitated</b> <b>copper</b> in a separate reaction vessel.

40|$|A {{new process}} concept is proposed, one that {{combines}} the inherent advantages of conventional hydro- and pyro-metallurgical processes to {{provide opportunities for}} significant increases in resource utilisation and smelter productivity. The process involves first leaching copper minerals in aqueous solution, separation of undesirable impurity elements from the solution using conventional hydrometallurgical technologies, and then preparation of a precipitated solid copper compound product. The product can then be used directly as a high-copper, low-iron feedstock in the smelting and/or converting stages of pyrometallurgical copper production. The solid <b>precipitated</b> <b>copper</b> product can be transported to the smelter and used as a separate feed, or {{can be used to}} enhance copper concentrations in sulphide concentrate blends.

Iron stimulated this activity under certain conditions. In the case of Rhodotorula strain L, iron stimulated copper precipitation aerobically at a copper concentration of 18 but not 180 μg/ml. Anaerobically, the L strain required iron for precipitation of copper from a medium with 180 μg of copper per ml. Rhodotorula strain L was able to precipitate about {{five times as much}} copper anaerobically as aerobically.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{deals with}} the study of {{adsorption}} properties of natural raw materials – siderite (S) and kaolin (K) as potential adsorbents of heavy metals cations. To enhance their adsorption capacity, the coating of their surfaces by MnO 2 was used (samples denoted as SM and KM). The changes of the surface parameters after the modification were studied by the low temperature nitrogen adsorption measurement. More expressive increase {{of the value of}} SBET was observed for the sample SM, from 6 to 36 m 2 g- 1. The nonhomogenous distribution of MnO 2 particles of needle shape on the siderite surface was observed by SEM. The results from the batch adsorption experiments of Cu(II) removal were processed by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The calculated value of maximum adsorption capacity increased after the modification from 12. 9 to 19. 8 mg g- 1 and from 10. 8 to 39. 8 mg g- 1 for siderite and kaolin, respectively. In the introductory experiments in dynamic regime, the columns filled with mixtures of S-K and S-KM were percolated with Cu(II) model solution.

The highest rate of peroxide production was observed under mild experimental conditions using O 2 and a large surface area photocatalyst CuO irradiated with a solar simulator having light intensities between 60 and 90 mW/cm 2. The CuO employed had a {{specific surface}} area (SSA) of 64. 8 - 70. 1 m 2 /g and was prepared in a tubular furnace by controlled thermal decomposition of <b>precipitated</b> <b>copper</b> oxalate. The CuOparticles produced were 1 μmcubes with primary particles around 15 nm. No peroxide was produced under the same conditions with commercial CuO, with SSA 200 times lower. The CuO synthesized during this work was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), specific surface area [Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) ], porosity, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). From XPS, it was observed that only CuII was present in the unused and used CuO. This indicates that the redox transient species involving other Cu oxidation states disappear very fast during the reaction, regenerating CuII during H 2 O 2 production. Diverse experiments provided some evidence for the possible interfacial reaction mechanism leading to H 2 O 2, following the initial step of O 2 -‚ formation on the CuO surface under irradiation with photons, with energies exceeding the band gap of CuO.

The ingots were grown from both stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric proportions of the starting elements copper, indium and selenium. Material prepared with excess selenium (CuInSe 2 2) showed increased p-type conductivity in the last zone to freeze of the ingot, while material grown with a deficiency (CuInSei 8) of this element showed n-type behaviour, with extra binary phases, such as InSe, in the last zone to freeze. Ingots with excess copper (CuxInSe 2), where x was 1. 1, 1. 2 and 1. 3, showed <b>precipitated</b> <b>copper</b> phase regions in the last zone to freeze and thin copper phase filaments emerging from the ingot end face.

The ground ore is built into heaps 1.2 km long and 400 m wide, and a recycling irrigation system is used to keep the grains wet. The heat produced by the bacterial oxidation keeps the heap warm throughout the year. Extraction is done twice in primary and secondary heaps.
