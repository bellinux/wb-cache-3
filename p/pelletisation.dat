50|$|Biomass {{can be an}} {{important}} energy source. However, nature provides a large diversity of biomass with varying characteristics. To create highly efficient biomass-to-energy chains, torrefaction of biomass in combination with densification (<b>pelletisation</b> or briquetting) is a promising step to overcome logistic economics in large-scale sustainable energy solutions, i.e. make it easier to transport and store it. Pellets or briquets are lighter, drier and stable in storage as opposed to the biomass they are made of.|$|E

50|$|Ammonium uranyl {{carbonate}} (UO2CO3·2(NH4)2CO3) {{is known}} in the uranium processing industry as AUC and is also called uranyl ammonium carbonate. This compound is important as a component in the conversion process of uranium hexafluoride (UF6) to uranium dioxide (UO2). The ammonium uranyl carbonate is combined with steam and hydrogen at 500-600 °C to yield UO2. In another process aqueous uranyl nitrate, known as uranyl nitrate liquor (UNL) is treated with ammonium bicarbonate to form ammonium uranyl carbonate as a solid precipitate. This is separated from the solution, dried with methanol and then calcinated with hydrogen directly to UO2 to obtain a sinterable grade powder. The ex-AUC uranium dioxide powder is free-flowing, relatively coarse (10 µ) and porous with specific surface area {{in the range of}} 5 m2/g and suitable for direct <b>pelletisation,</b> avoiding the granulation step. Conversion to UO2 is often performed as the first stage of nuclear fuel fabrication.|$|E

50|$|The use {{of straw}} in {{large-scale}} biomass power plants is becoming mainstream in the EU, with several facilities already online. The straw is either used {{directly in the}} form of bales, or densified into pellets which allows for the feedstock to be transported over longer distances. Finally, torrefaction of straw with <b>pelletisation</b> is gaining attention, because it increases the energy density of the resource, making it possible to transport it still further. This processing step also makes storage much easier, because torrefied straw pellets are hydrophobic. Torrefied straw {{in the form of}} pellets can be directly co-fired with coal or natural gas at very high rates and make use of the processing infrastructures at existing coal and gas plants. Because the torrefied straw pellets have superior structural, chemical and combustion properties to coal, they can replace all coal and turn a coal plant into an entirely biomass-fed power station. First generation pellets are limited to a co-firing rate of 15% in modern IGCC plants.|$|E

40|$|For the {{predictive}} modelling of the high-shear <b>pelletisation</b> process {{it is necessary}} to {{have a better understanding of}} the underlying mechanisms. Therefore, <b>pelletisation</b> experiments were carried out with microcrystalline cellulose and lactose in a coffee grinder (small-scale) and in a Gral 10 ('large'-scale). A toroidal flow-pattern was observed and described for both apparatus. There was no effect of increased impeller speed on the velocity of pellets in the torus; only a change in angle with the tangential direction was observed. Moreover, the size of pellets decreased rapidly to a new value. This size increased again when the impeller speed was reduced to the initial (low) value. This suggested the existence of fast break-up and growth, resulting in a dynamic equilibrium depending on the impeller speed. Tracer experiments were used to investigate the turnover limes of different sieve fractions. First order conversion rate constants for the pellets of different sieve fractions, calculated from colour concentrations at several processing times, were equal for both apparatus when plotted against the dimensionless diameter of the pellets (d/d(50)). These results are a strong indication for the usefulness of small-scale experiments to retrieve a rapid insight into relevant mechanisms of growth of high-shear <b>pelletisation.</b> (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Physical {{and thermal}} {{properties}} of Compritol® and Precirol® as potential lipophilic binders in melt <b>pelletisation</b> {{process for the}} preparation of sustained-release matrix pellets were evaluated in this study. Experimental measurements were carried out using X-ray diffractometry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), hot-stage microscopy (HSM) and rheological measurements. These {{studies have shown that}} the lipophilic binders may present a relatively complex behaviour depending on the sample treatment (untreated, freshly solidified, aged samples). DSC and HSM methods have shown the presence of polymorphism for Precirol. Moreover, both untreated and fresh solidified Precirol and Compritol samples present partially amorphous layered structure which slowly crystallise in time. The rate of crystallisation was found to be more rapid for Precirol, and highly dependent on the ageing conditions (storage temperature). Finally, the evaluation of the thermal and rheological properties of Precirol and Compritol mixtures have shown that the use of such mixtures, presenting well distinct melting properties, could be a very interesting tool for the preparation of high fatty binder content prolonged-release pellets in high shear mixers if the product temperature is carefully controlled (between 45 and 50 °C) during the <b>pelletisation</b> process. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Spent {{mushroom}} compost (SMC) is an agricultural waste disposed of in an unsustainable and environmentally degrading manner - mainly in landfills. For every 1 kg of mushrooms grown, approximately 5 kg of SMC is produced, where current generation in the UK is 200, 000 tJa. Coal tailings, an industrial by-product from coal mining, are also discarded untenably in lagoons; removing these deposits will eliminate the associated environmental hazards. This project aimed to combine these waste materials into a suitable 'green' fuel for industry through thermal treatment, to produce energy from a sustainable source. Not only will this alleviate the issues regarding existing waste management strategies, {{but will also}} attempt to mitigate {{the environmental impacts of}} energy generation from nonrenewable sources, such as anthropogenic climate change, through the generation of renewable energy. This PhD research has shown that both materials had high moisture contents, which negatively impacted the calorific value (CV).

After determination of the size distribution, the pellet characterisation included scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), specific surface area and true density determination. Hence, the in vitro release from every single size fraction (2000, 1250, 800, 630, < 630 microm) was evaluated and the release mechanism was analysed {{with the help of an}} appropriate mathematical model. The results of drug content and superficial atomic composition were found to be constant in all pellets size fractions, attesting the ability of melt <b>pelletisation</b> in a high shear mixer to form a product with homogeneous composition. The mathematical model is built on the hypotheses that drug diffusion and solid drug dissolution in the release environment are the key phenomena affecting drug release kinetics. Smaller classes apart (particles are not perfectly spherical), the comparison between model best fitting and experimental data indicated the reasonability of these hypotheses. Moreover, model reliability is proved by its ability of predicting drug release from a known mixture of the above mentioned particles classes...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: There {{are many}} {{successful}} co-firing installations, nevertheless various constraints {{can still be}} encountered, especially in direct co-firing mode, and with tendency to increase biomass/coal ratio, and use of low quality biomass. These constraints can include handling, storage, milling and feeding problems, deposit formation (slagging and fouling), agglomeration, corrosion, erosion, and ash utilization issues. One of the options to address them is application of biomass pre-treatment, which, by modifying biomass properties, can addresses problems at their source. The aim of this work is to {{provide an overview of}} possible constraints that can be encountered in systems co-firing coal with biomass, and identify biomass pre-treatment options with potential to address them. The pre-treatment options discussed include sizing, drying, washing, <b>pelletisation,</b> torrefaction and pyrolysis of biomass, as well as combinations of some of them. It is not possible to define one universal pre-treatment option for biomass for co-firing purposes. It needs to be decided on an individual basis, depending on various elements such as quality of raw biomass, type of co-firing system, desired co-firing ratio, and others. JRC.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Torrefaction is a mild {{pre-treatment}} {{of biomass}} at a temperature between 200 - 300 °C. During torrefaction the biomass its properties are changed {{to obtain a}} much better fuel quality for combustion and gasification applications. In combination with <b>pelletisation,</b> torrefaction also aids the logistic issues that exist for untreated biomass. This paper treats the principles of torrefaction and production technology that is under development at ECN (TOP technology {{for the production of}} TOP pellets from biomass). Attention is also paid to the process its economics and its influence on the economics of a biomass-to-energy production chain. Torrefaction of biomass is an effective method to improve the grindability of biomass to enable more efficient co-firing in existing power stations or entrained-flow gasification for the production of chemicals and transportation fuels. Torrefaction by means of the TOP process leads to a very energy dense fuel pellet of 15 - 18. 5 GJ/m 3. Typically, the process has a thermal efficiency of 96 % and the total production costs amount 40 - 50 €/ton of TOP pellets.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a Hierarchical Analytical Network Process (HANP) model is {{demonstrated}} for evaluating alternative technologies for generating electricity from MSW in India. The technological alternatives and evaluation {{criteria for the}} HANP study are characterised by reviewing the literature and consulting {{experts in the field}} of waste management. Technologies reviewed in the context of India include landfill, anaerobic digestion, incineration, <b>pelletisation</b> and gasification. To investigate the sensitivity of the result, we examine variations in expert opinions and carry out an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) analysis for comparison. We find that anaerobic digestion is the preferred technology for generating electricity from MSW in India. Gasification is indicated as the preferred technology in an AHP model due to the exclusion of criteria dependencies and in an HANP analysis when placing a high priority on net output and retention time. We conclude that HANP successfully provides a structured framework for recommending which technologies to pursue in India, and the adoption of such tools is critical at a time when key investments in infrastructure are being made. Therefore the presented methodology is thought to have a wider potential for investors, policy makers, researchers and plant developers in India and elsewhere...|$|E

40|$|Soya is an {{important}} bulk agricultural product often transported by sea as chipped beans and/or the bean husks after <b>pelletisation.</b> There are proven allergens in both forms. Bulk handling of soya imports can generate air pollution containing dust, allergens, and pyrogens, posing health risks to dockside workers and surrounding populations. Using an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standardised rotating drum dustiness test in seven imported soya bulks, we compared the generated levels of dust and two major soya allergens in three particle sizes related to respiratory health. Extractable levels of allergen and endotoxin from the bulks showed 30 – 60 fold differences, with levels of one allergen (hydrophobic seed protein) and endotoxin higher in husk. The generated levels of dust and allergens in the three particle sizes also showed very wide variations between bulks, with aerolysed levels of allergen influenced by both the inherent dustiness and the extractable allergen in each bulk. Percentage allergen aerolysed from pelletized husk—often assumed to be of low dustiness—after transportation was not lower than that from chipped beans. Thus, not all soya bulks pose the same inhalation health risk and reinforces the importance of controlling dust generation from handling all soya bulk to as low as reasonably practicable...|$|E
