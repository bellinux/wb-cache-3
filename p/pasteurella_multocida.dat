Pasteurella lipoprotein E (PlpE) has been reported to be an important cross reactive outer membrane protein in P. multocida. The gene encoding the PlpE of P. multocida serotypes A: 3, B: 2 and D: 1 was amplified from the genomic DNA. The amplified products were cloned and the nucleotide sequence was determined. Sequence analysis of the recombinant clones revealed a single open reading frame of 1, 011 bp, 1, 008 bp and 1, 017 bp encoding a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 37. 829 kDa, 37. 389 kDa and 37. 965 kDa for serotypes A: 3, B: 2 and D: 1 respectively. The comparison of the plpE sequence in different capsular types revealed a high degree (> 90 %) of homology. Furthermore, the plpE gene of Haemorhhagic septicaemia causing serotype (B: 2) was expressed in E. coli and recombinant PlpE was strongly immunostained by antiserum against whole cell antigen, indicating that the protein is expressed in vivo...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Swine {{respiratory}} {{diseases such}} as atrophic rhinitis and bronchopneumonia caused by <b>Pasteurella</b> (P.) <b>multocida</b> cause important economic losses to the modern swine industry. The {{purpose of this study}} was to characterize P. multocida strains isolated from swine lungs by RAPD (Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA) to demonstrate their genetic diversity. Ninety-four samples of fragments from lungs with pneumonia and sixty one samples without pneumonia were collected in slaughterhouses in Mato Grosso during the period from December 2009 to March 2010. Clinical cases in 2012 and 2013 were also included in this study. Among the lung fragments with macroscopic lesions, without macroscopic lesions and clinical samples, 40. 42 %, 4. 49 % and 100 % were positive for P. multocida, respectively. Bacterial identification culturing was confirmed by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) by means of the amplification of the gene kmt 1. RAPD technique was performed for 46 isolates, and in every isolate, a total of 7 to 11 amplification bands were detected, composed of 8 clusters based on genetic similarity. Thus, treatment, control and preventive measures should consider the genetic diversity of P. multocida populations in swine herds in order to improve the development of new protocols to produce antimicrobials and vaccines...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} study was to detect selected pathogens in pneumonic lung tissue of dogs of different age groups by immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridisation (ISH) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) {{in order to get}} information about their involvement in pneumonia formation. In archived formalin-fixed and paraffin wax-embedded lung samples from 68 cases with the clinical and histologic diagnosis of pneumonia the histological pattern of pneumonia was re-evaluated and the samples were further investigated for the following infectious agents: canine distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV- 2), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), Bordetella (B.) bronchiseptica, <b>Pasteurella</b> (P.) <b>multocida,</b> Mycoplasma spp., and Pneumocystis spp. In 47. 1 % of the samples {{at least one of the}} featured respiratory pathogens was detected. In 31. 3 % of these positive samples more than one pathogen could be found. The correct detection of CDV had been achieved in ten out of eleven positive cases (90. 9 %) upon initial investigation, but the presence of bacterial pathogens, like B. bronchiseptica (10 cases) and P. multocida (17 cases) had been missed in all but one case. While CDV and CRCoV infections were exclusively found in dogs younger than one year, the vast majority of infections with P. multocida and B. bronchiseptica were both common either in dogs younger than 4 months or older than one year. Thus, this retrospective approach yielded valuable data on the presence, absence and prevalence of certain respiratory pathogens in dogs with pneumonia...|$|R

25|$|Natural {{sources of}} {{mortality}} are largely reported in anecdotes. On rare occasions, golden eagles {{have been killed}} by competing predators or by hunting mammalian carnivores, including the aforementioned wolverine, snow leopard, cougar, brown bear and white-tailed eagle attacks. Most competitive attacks resulting in death probably occur at the talons of other golden eagles. Nestlings and fledglings {{are more likely to be}} killed by another predator than free-flying juveniles and adults. It has been suspected that golden eagle nests may be predated more frequently by other predators (especially birds, which are often the only other large animals that can access a golden eagle nest without the assistance of man-made climbing equipment) in areas where golden eagles are regularly disturbed at the nest by humans. Jeff Watson believed that common raven occasionally eats golden eagle eggs but only in situations where the parent eagles have abandoned their nesting attempt. However, there are no confirmed accounts of predation by other bird species on golden eagle nests. Occasionally, golden eagles may be killed by their prey in self-defense. There is an account of a golden eagle dying from the quills of a North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) it had attempted to hunt. On the Isle of Rùm in Scotland, there are few cases of red deer trampling golden eagles to death, probably the result of a hind having intercepted a bird that was trying to kill a fawn. Although usually well out-matched by the predator, occasionally other large birds can put up a formidable fight against a golden eagle. An attempted capture of a great blue heron by a golden eagle resulted in the death of both birds from wounds sustained in the ensuing fight. There is at least one case in Scotland of a golden eagle dying after being “oiled” by a northern fulmar, a bird whose primary defense against predators is to disgorge an oily secretion which may inhibit the predator's ability to fly. Of natural sources of death, starvation is probably under-reported. 11 of 16 dead juvenile eagles which had hatched in Denali National Park had died of starvation. Of 36 deaths of golden eagles in Idaho, 55% were possibly attributable to natural causes, specifically 8 (26%) from unknown trauma, 3 (10%) from disease and 6 (19%) from unknown causes. Of 266 golden eagle deaths in Spain, only 6% were from unknown causes that could not directly attributed to human activities. Avian cholera caused by bacteria (<b>Pasteurella</b> <b>multocida)</b> infects eagles that eat waterfowl that have died from the disease. The protozoan Trichomonas sp. caused the deaths of 4 fledglings in a study of wild golden eagles in Idaho. Several further diseases that contribute to golden eagle deaths have been examined in Japan. A captive eagle died from two malignant tumors – one in the liver and one in the kidney.|$|E
40|$|Sixty-six rabbits, with {{no history}} of {{vaccination}} against myxomatosis and which had died of pulmonary lesions, were submitted for virological and serological tests for Myxoma virus (MV) infection and for bacteriological examinations. At post mortem, the diagnoses based on observed lesions were as follows: acute haemorrhagic pneumonia (38 %); acute suppurative bronchopneumonia (35 %); and fibrinohaemorrhagic bronchopneumonia with fibrinous pleuritis (27 %). MV was isolated from 10 % of the rabbits, mainly from those with acute haemorrhagic pneumonia. Serological evidence of MV infection was demonstrated in 44 % of rabbits. Pathogenic bacteria species isolated from lungs were <b>Pasteurella</b> (spp. and <b>multocida),</b> Escherichia coli, Bordetella bronchiseptica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively, from 41, 11, 7 and 6 % of samples.

40|$|The {{ability of}} the aerobic {{bacterial}} flora from the normal bovine respiratory and reproductive tracts to enhance or inhibit the growth of <b>Pasteurella</b> haemolytica, P. <b>multocida,</b> and Haemophilus somnus was tested in vitro. Six strains {{of each of these}} pathogens were cross streaked with each isolate of bovine normal flora. Flora which enhanced the growth of these pathogenic bacteria outnumbered inhibitors four to one. An intermediate number of isolates produced no effect on pathogen growth. Most enhancers were gram positive (Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, or Rhodococcus isolates), although several isolates of Moraxella and Actinobacter were also good enhancers. For H. somnus, there were proportionally more organisms which produced marked enhancement among the preputial flora than among the nasal flora, which may account for the greater number of genital carriers than nasal carriers. Bacillus isolates were the most significant inhibitors among the nasal flora, whereas no genus or species from the reproductive tract was noted to produce appreciable inhibition. It is proposed that changes in ratios of inhibitors to enhancers may determine, in part, whether a carrier state or disease occurs. Also, suggestions are made for in vitro use of this phenomenon for diagnostic tests...|$|R

In 1970 and 1971 fewer PC than NPC calves were treated for acute respiratory tract disease during outbreaks of PI 3 infection. The differences in clinical respiratory disease were significant in 1971. Inclusion of two doses of P. hemolytica and P. multocida bacterin before the sale in 1971 and use of an intranasal PI 3 vaccine was considered to improve the PC program.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to verify whether <b>Pasteurella</b> haemolytica, P. <b>multocida</b> and Salmonella typhimurium porins could affect the {{inducible}} nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nitric oxide (NO) release by murine resident peritoneal macrophages in vitro. We also compared their effect with that elicited by P. haemolytica, P, multocida and S. typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (LPS) whose biological activity is well known. Variations in NO release and NOS mRNA expression due to variable concentrations of porins were recorded and compared. We also investigated the synergism between bacterial products and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). With this aim cells were incubated with porins together with murine rIFN-gamma prior to assessing the presence of NO in the supernatant and mRNA analysis. Porins in themselves were not able to induce NO release by resident peritoneal macrophages. Incubation of macrophages with IFN-gamma in the presence of porins increased NO release, whereas incubation in the presence of the arginine analog N-G-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMA) inhibited NO release. The greatest NO release was obtained using porins at a concentration of 5 mu g/mL. Porins, together with IFN-gamma, were also able to upregulate the mRNA expression of iNOS. Our findings suggest that Gram-negative porins are able to modulate inflammatory and immunological responses by affecting the release of NO and the expression of iNOS gene in activated macrophages...|$|R
