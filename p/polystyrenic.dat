30|$|The {{smart control}} of OPBE {{concentration}} in the reaction medium could also be achieved by adsorbing the substrate on hydrophobic resins (Figure  4 B). D’Arrigo and coworkers proved that XAD™ 1180, a <b>polystyrenic</b> adsorbent selected among several Amberlite resins, was effective in controlling the OPBE amount presented in water phase. OPBE (1  g L− 1) could be reduced asymmetrically employing Pichia pastoris with 99 % conversion and 95 % ee (R) [7]. Continuous batch reactor (CBR) was established combining the biotransformation and OPBE/HPBE adsorption. In the CBR unit, the bioreduction of OPBE was carried out for 48  h at a substrate-feeding flow rate of 1  mL min− 1, resulting 95.1 % ee (R) and conversion rate of 25 %.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The morphology, {{relaxation}} properties, and conductivity of {{the statistical}} copolymer <b>polystyrenic</b> (alkoxy 1 H-tetrazole-co-alkoxy nitrile), an anhydrous proton conductor, were measured. The material phase-separates into hard and soft domains, the latter corresponding to a phase richer in the pendant tetrazole groups. Using dielectric and mechanical spectroscopies, two relaxation processes were observed, the slower associated with local segmental dynamics of the backbone and the higher-frequency process involving motion of the tetrazole moieties. The latter is coupled to the ionic conductivity, which means that below the principal glass transition of the material (∼ 313 K) the conductive mechanism remains active. Thus, the usual compromise in proton exchange membranes between mechanical stability and ion conductivity can be avoided. The attraction of new energy sources has stimulated develop-ment of both new and existing technologies. An obvious enabling factor for devices such as photovoltaic and fuel cells i...|$|E
40|$|Batch {{isotherm}} {{experiments were}} carried out to select the best chromatographic supports for the purification of beet distillery condensates {{with the aim of}} recovering fermentable water. Adsorption parameters of four inhibitory solutes of the condensates chosen as targets were obtained, leading to the selection of a weak anion-exchanger and a <b>polystyrenic</b> resin. These results were further used for the chromatographic scaleup. Dynamic adsorption experiments run on both resins with a synthetic mixture of the four target solutes showed the presence of competition for the adsorption. The extended Langmuir model was then found to be applicable for a first estimation of the solute breakthrough. The treatment efficiencies of the two supports were confirmed with an industrial condensate, indicating components in the effluent that were not considered did not significantly affect the adsorption of the main compounds. Eventually, {{a combination of the two}} complementary resins was proposed for complete effluent detoxification...|$|E
50|$|Nonylphenol {{is used in}} {{manufacturing}} antioxidants, lubricating oil additives, laundry and dish detergents, emulsifiers, and solubilizers. It {{can also be used}} to produce tris(4-nonyl-phenyl) phosphite (TNPP), which is an antioxidant used to protect polymers, such as rubber, Vinyl polymers, polyolefins, and <b>polystyrenics</b> in addition to being a stabilizer in plastic food packaging. Barium and calcium salts of nonylphenol are also used as heat stabilizers for polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Nonylphenol is also often used an intermediate in the manufacture of the non-ionic surfactants nonylphenol exthoxylates, which are used in detergents, paints, pesticides, personal care products, and plastics. Nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates are only used as components of household detergents outside of Europe.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSpent ion {{exchange}} resins are radioactive process wastes {{for which there is}} no satisfactory industrial treatment. Supercritical water oxidation could offer a viable treatment alternative to destroy the organic structure of resins and contain radioactivity. IER degradation experiments were carried out in a continuous supercritical water reactor. Total organic carbon degradation rates in the range of 95 - 98 % were obtained depending on operating conditions. GC-MS chromatography analyses were carried out to determine intermediate products formed during the reaction. Around 50 species were identified for cationic and anionic resins. Degradation of <b>polystyrenic</b> structure leads to the formation of low molecular weight compounds. Benzoic acid, phenol and acetic acid are the main compounds. However, other products are detected in appreciable yields such as phenolic species or heterocycles, for anionic IERs degradation. Intermediates produced by intramolecular rearrangements are also obtained. A radical degradation mechanism is proposed for each resin. In this overall mechanism, several hypotheses are foreseen, according to HOOradical dot radical attack sites...|$|E
40|$|Styrene is a {{compound}} {{widely used in}} the manufacture of <b>polystyrenic</b> plastics and it has recently been shown to exert mutagenic effects after metabolic activation into styrene oxide by the microsomal mixed function oxidases; this oxide is further converted into inactive styrene glycol. In order to investigate the relative importance of activation and desactivation processes of styrene, we developed a gas chromatographic method which enables us to simultaneously measure styrene oxide and styrene glycol formed after incubation of styrene with microsomal preparations from different tissues. After selective extraction of the two compounds from the incubation mixture, they are derivatized with pentafluorobenzoyl chloride and measured by gas chromatography using an electron capture detector. The high sensitivity of the method, which allows 0. 01 ng of both compounds to be measured, as well as its selectiveity, has permitted us to adequately evaluate the kinetic parameters of styrene oxidase and styrene oxide hydratase activities, as well as their modifications under the influence of various pretreatments of the animals...|$|E
40|$|Perfluorinated {{compounds}} (PFCs) {{have been}} detected globally in drinking water at trace concentrations. This is attributable to the chemical properties that characterize these compounds: strong saturated carbon-fluorine bonds which make them resistant to chemical, physical, and biological degradation. Manufacturing wastes, sewage treatment plants, and leaching from consumer products are the primary pathways by which PFCs enter the environment. Drinking water occurrence studies indicate that PFCs, if present in source water, can pass through drinking water treatment processes and be present in finished drinking water. While they are currently not regulated, several PFCs {{have been included in}} the USEPA’s 3 rd unregulated contaminant monitoring list. As yet there is no clear understanding of the fate of PFCs during drinking water treatment. Full-scale surveys and bench-scale studies indicate that activated carbon adsorption and ion exchange treatment may be effective. Elucidation of the fate of selected PFCs at environmentally relevant concentrations during granular activated carbon (GAC) and ion exchange treatment was the primary objective of this research. A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) -based analytical method employing electron impact ionization was developed to analyze perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs), the selected target class of PFCs. Solid phase extraction was used to concentrate samples, and the PFCAs were derivatized using butanol in the presence of sulfuric acid and heat. The method detection limits for PFCAs with six to nine carbons were 16 ng/L- 30 ng/L in ultrapure water and 16 ng/L- 49 ng/L in Grand River water (GRW). Three PFCAs were selected as targets for adsorption studies: perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Adsorption behaviour of the target PFCAs in ultrapure water was assessed using four GACs, two anion exchange resins, and two alternative adsorbents. Single solute isotherms show that macroporous <b>polystyrenic</b> A- 500 P® (A- 500 P) ion exchange resin has a higher equilibrium capacity compared to the coal-based Filtrasorb® (F- 400) GAC or the macroporous polyacrylic A- 860 ® (A- 860) ion exchange resin. During time dependent PFCA removal experiments at a target initial PFCA concentration of 3 µg/L, A- 500 P resin achieved the highest removal of the target PFCAs at equilibrium (> 95 %) followed by the F- 400 GAC (92 % at equilibrium). This was followed by coconut shell-based AquaCarb CX 1230 ® (CX) GAC and the two wood-based GACs – Norit C-Gran® (C-Gran) and NuChar WV B- 30 ® (B- 30). The A- 860 resin achieved 66 %- 80 % removal of the target PFCAs. BET surface area was not a good indicator of comparative PFCA removal performance, although pore size distribution, surface charge and particle size appeared to play a role. The alternative sorbents – cattle bone-based Fija Fluor® and a dairy manure-based Biochar – could not substantially remove the target PFCAs, potentially attributable to low micropore content and a predominantly mesoporous structure. Kinetics with the anion exchange resins were substantially faster compared to the GACs and the alternative sorbents, with A- 500 P as the fastest resin. Direct competition among the PFCAs for sorption sites was observed only on the A- 860 resin. Further, chain length-dependent removal trends were not observed with the F- 400 or CX GACs or the A- 500 P resin. Based on kinetics data in ultrapure water the GACs CX and F- 400, the ion exchange resins-A 500 P and A 860, and the alternative adsorbent Biochar were selected for further evaluation in surface water using GRW. As with ultrapure water, the A- 500 P resin achieved the fastest and highest removal of the target PFCAs in GRW (~ 95 %); however, the A- 860 resin failed to achieve any substantial removal. Among the carbonaceous adsorbents, F- 400 better removed the target PFCAs than CX and the Biochar. The presence of natural organic material (NOM) and inorganic anions in GRW lowered the equilibrium PFCA sorption amounts by 90 to 99 % compared to those in ultrapure water. The humic fraction of NOM was the dominant competitor for the GACs and Biochar; however, both NOM and inorganic anions, especially sulfate, exerted competition on the anion exchange resins. Low removal of NOM with Biochar indicate that Biochar may not be used as an NOM pretreatment while high removal of NOM with ion exchange resins indicated that the tested resins may be effective as a pretreatment for GAC adsorbers. Overall, this research demonstrates that GAC adsorption and strong base ion exchange can be promising PFCA removal techniques for drinking water. However, such premises should not be generalized as surface water matrix, adsorbent properties and PFCA characteristics may affect their removal...|$|E
