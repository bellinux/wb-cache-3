40|$|The {{rendezvous}} technique, combining percutaneous and endoscopic procedures, is a {{safe and}} effective method to achieve biliary cannulation if an endoscopic approach fails.

A simultaneous approach is reported to be associated with fewer complications, and patients undergoing this approach can recover and be discharged more rapidly. Here, we report a complication of pneumoperitoneum in a patient who underwent percutaneous and endoscopic procedures simultaneously for the removal of a common bile duct stone. It was supposed that prolonged air insufflation during endoscopy forced intestinal air to track into the peritoneal cavity through the bile ducts and the <b>puncture</b> <b>tract.</b> Accordingly, a short wait before removing the percutaneous catheter to deflate the intestinal air will be helpful to avoid such a complication...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose: Percutaneous renal {{access in}} the context of {{percutaneous}} nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a difficult technique, requiring rapid and precise access to a particular calix. We present a computerized system designed to improve percutaneous renal access by projecting the ultrasound <b>puncture</b> <b>tract</b> onto fluoroscopic images. Materials and Methods: The system consists of a computer and a localizer allowing spatial localization of the position of the various instruments. Without any human intervention, the ultrasound nephrostomy tract is superimposed in real time onto fluoroscopic images acquired in various views. Results: We tested our approach by laboratory experiments on a phantom. Also, after approval by our institution's Ethics Committee, we validated this technique in the operating room during PCNL in one patient. Conclusion: Our system is reliable, and the absence of image-processing procedures makes it robust. We have initiated a prospective study to validate this technique both for PCNL specialists and as a learning tool...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{use of the}} Mini PCNL {{has been}} gaining {{momentum}} since its first description in 2001. The range of indications for this particular procedure may also be expanding. We describe {{a case of a}} large renal calculus in a renal collecting system, found in a patient who underwent an Anatrophic Nephro-Lithotomy [ANL] procedure a few years back. He subsequently developed a flank (incisional) hernia after the ANL. Some, twenty years later he presented with another large (22 Â mm) stone in the same system. Observation: Attempt at stone clearance was performed using the Mini PCNL. To avoid iatrogenic injury to the surrounding bowel loops in the hernia sac, a combined ultrasound and fluoroscopic technique was performed, with limited respiration and suspended abdominal fat at the time of renal access. The dilation was performed to accommodate the Mini PCNL sheath, thus minimizing the possibility of iatrogenic bowel injury. A serial balloon dilator was not used, in the presence of such severe fibrosis from the previous open surgery (ANL). Conclusion: The presence of a hernial sac within the ipsilateral flank may be amenable to Mini PCNL, provided the basic principles of puncture are maintained. This includes the use of adequate positioning, limited respiration and the use of ultra-sound identification of the bowel loops during access <b>puncture</b> and <b>tract</b> dilatation. A new indication for the use of Mini PCNL is thus reported...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Tubeless {{pediatric}} percutaneous nephrolithotomy (TL-PCNL) {{is evolving}} and adult criteria are being safely applied to children. We examine the feasibility, safety, and outcomes of pediatric TL. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of pediatric (â¤ 18 years) PCNL patients at our institute was done. Patients eligible for TL but underwent tube (T) PCNL due to surgeon choice or protocol {{were compared with}} TL. Only children with 100 % stone clearance were included, and those receiving nephrostomy for intraoperative complications {{were excluded from the}} study. Demographic, baseline, and stone characteristics were matched. Safety, outcome, and complications were assessed. Group T was classified into large bore (22 F-LB) and small bore (16 F-SB) based on nephrostomy size. Statistical analysis was done. Results: A total of 46 children were eligible - TL in 17 (37 %) and T in 29 (63 %). Among T, SB was performed in 6 / 29 (20. 7 %) and LB in 23 / 29 (79. 3 %). TL had fewer complications. Urinary leak developed in 2 (6. 9 %) patients in T. Eight (27. 6 %) patients in T and 3 (17. 7 %) patients in TL had supracostal access with complications similar to infracostal access. SB had significantly lesser and analgesic requirement than LB. SB and TL had similar LOH and analgesic requirement. Adult expanded criteria such as supracostal access, 2 punctures, prior renal surgery, and larger tract size were feasible. Conclusions: TL is safe, feasible, and less morbid alternative to T in uncomplicated pediatric nephrolithiasis. TL is feasible with supracostal access, 2 <b>punctures,</b> adult <b>tract</b> size (24 F), and anomalous kidneys. SB nephrostomy is reasonable when tube is indicated...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Aiming at {{promoting}} and facilitating {{learning and}} training in percutaneous renal surgery, we have created an easy to assemble, reproducible and cheap laboratory model. The model was built using pig kidney, foam layer, plastic catheter, linen or cotton holding sutures, and wide scotch tape. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: The kidney with catheterized ureter is fixed and involved in a foam layer. It stays hidden, and is visible only through radioscopy. This model is positioned and fixed to a radiological table {{in such a way}} that it simulates the patient&# 8217;s lumbar region. After that, contrast medium is injected through the ureter, and the urinary system is examined through radioscopy. All percutaneous maneuvers can be accomplished, from the <b>puncture,</b> <b>tract</b> dilation, insertion of Amplatz sheath, and introduction of nephroscope, allowing lithotripsy and endopielotomy, as well as other types of percutaneous surgeries. COMMENTS: The great advantage of this model is its easy construction, by using very cheap and widely available material. Foam can be several times washed and reused. After treatment, the model can be immediately open, and a critical analysis can be made, being then possible to verify if the place of renal puncture was well chosen, if dilation was correctly accomplished, and if the collecting system has been preserved. Therefore, this model can represent a great advance for the learning {{and training in}} percutaneous surgery...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is an {{effective}} treatment for renal stones. Due to the significant pain and morbidity after standard PCNL because of nephrostomy tubes, various modifications of PCNL are being performed. We report a randomized trial comparing these modalities. Materials and Methods: A total of 75 patients were randomized into three groups of 25 each: standard PCNL with nephrostomy tubes (Group 1), tubeless PCNL with ureteric stent and no nephrostomy (Group 2), and totally tubeless PCNL without ureteric catheter or nephrostomy (Group 3). Randomization was done {{at the end of}} the procedure for those patients satisfying the inclusion criteria based on duration of surgery, single <b>puncture</b> <b>tract,</b> intraoperative bleeding, stone burden, intact pelvicalyceal system, and no residual stones at the end of procedure. The outcomes measured were hemoglobin (Hb) drop, hemorrhage, need for blood transfusion, pyrexia, urine leak, pain score, analgesic requirement, and duration of hospital stay. Results: There was no significant difference in hemorrhage, Hb drop, need for blood transfusion, and postoperative pyrexia among the groups. All patients except one in the standard group only had variable amount of urinary leak. The analgesic requirement and duration of hospital stay attained statistical significance in favor of tubeless and totally tubeless groups compared to the standard. Conclusions: Tubeless and totally tubeless PCNL are safe and effective method of renal stone management. Totally tubeless PCNL significantly reduced postoperative pain and morbidity compared to the tubeless method...|$|E
40|$|Background: EUS-guided biliary {{drainage}} (EUS-BD) {{has emerged}} as an alternative rescue method in patients with failed ERCP. Opportunities for teaching and training are limited because of a low case volume at most centers. Objective: To evaluate a stereolithography/ 3 -dimensional (3 D) printing bile duct prototype for teaching and training in EUS-BD. Design: Prospective observational feasibility study. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Subjects: Twenty endosonographers attending an interventional EUS workshop. Intervention: A prototype of a dilated biliary system was prepared by computer-aided design and 3 D printing. The study participants performed guidewire manipulation and EUS-BD procedures (antegrade procedure and/or choledochoduodenostomy) on the prototype. Participants were scored with the device {{on a scale of}} 1 to 5 via a questionnaire. Participants' success rate for various steps of the EUS-BD procedure was noted. Main Outcome Measurements: Subjective and objective evaluation of the prototype regarding its overall applicability, quality of radiographic and EUS images, and 4 steps of EUS-BD procedure (needle puncture, guidewire manipulation, tract dilation, stent placement). Results: Fifteen participants returned the questionnaire, and 10 completed all 4 steps of EUS-BD. The median score for overall utility was 4, whereas that for EUS and US views was 5. Participants with experience in performing more than 20 EUS-BD procedures scored the prototype significantly lower for stent placement (P =. 013) and equivalent for needle <b>puncture,</b> <b>tract</b> dilation, and wire manipulation.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to examine whether the thrombosed portal vein can be recanalized via transjugular vein. 14 {{patients}} (age 51, 8 " 15, 8 years, 8 male, 6 female) were treated due to portal vein thrombosis. After transjugular puncture of an intrahepatic portal vein branch in the right liver lobe, we tried to introduce the guide wire in medial direction to the portal vein. When the wire deviated to lateral direction, the puncture needle was pulled and a Cobra catheter was introduced over the wire. The catheter tip was placed at the puncture site of the portal vein branch and directed to medial direction. The guide wire was then introduced to medial direction. The whole transhepatic <b>puncture</b> <b>tract</b> and the thrombosed part of the portal vein was dilated. If the thrombus involved the confluens of the superior mesenteric vein and splenic vein, this vein was laso dilated. Then self expandable stents with diameter of 10 mm and length of 4 to 6 cm were implanted. In 12 of the 14 patients guide wire was successfully introduced into the superior mesenteric of splenic vein. Thus, the rate of successful access with the guide wire beyond the thrombosed portal vein was 86 % (12 of 14). The rate of technically successful TIPS implantation was 85 %. 9 of the 14 patients showed an occluded right portal vein. Transjugular access beyond the portal vein was achieved in 78 % of the patients (7 of 9). 5 showed partially thrombosed right portal vein. Transjugular access beyond the portal vein was achieved in 100 % of the patients (5 of 5) According to Chi square test the difference between occluded and partially thrmbosed portal vein was not significant with regard to the accessibility of the portal vein (p> 0, 05). In all patients in whom the guide wire could be introduced into the right portal vein, the portal vein could be accessed with the guide wire and the guide wire could be introduced beyond the thrombosed portal vein. 54. 5 % of the patients survived less than 6 months after recanalization and TIPS implantation. Leaving out the patients with malignant disease there were only 28. 6 % whon died within the first 6 months. 30 % of the patients needed a revision within the first year and 14. 3 % within the second year. We concluded that partially thrombosed portal vein is not a mechanical barrier or contraindication against TIPS implantation. In case of occluded portal vein with or without cavernous transformation recanalization should be attempted when there is a clinical indication. The rate of reintervention is not greater than in patientes without portal vein thrombosis. In patients without malignant tumor in the liver survival rate within the first 6 months after recanalization and TIPS implantation seems to be similar with the survival rate of patients without portal vein thrmobosis after TIPS implantation...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{intervertebral}} disc (IVD) {{is composed of}} the annulus fibrosus (AF), which surrounds and contains the nucleus pulposus (NP). It is hypothesized that when the IVD becomes injured, {{in the case of}} IVD herniation, a localized innate immune response is initiated. Although the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines in injured IVDs has been well documented, the extent to which inflammation affects the mechanical properties of the IVD remains poorly understood. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of IVD damage (via puncture) and inflammation (via lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure) on the mechanical and structural properties of the IVD. Methods: Four functional spinal units (FSUs) (bone-IVD-bone) were dissected and removed from the tails of 20 Sprague Dawley rats (80 FSUs in total). In half of the FSUs, a puncture model (using a 19 G needle) was used to mimic IVD herniation. Each FSU (two punctured and two non-punctured) was subsequently cultured in media to support cell viability. Further, 10 ug/mL of LPS was added to the media of one punctured and one non-punctured FSU. FSUs were then cultured for either 24 hours or 6 days after which they were removed and mechanically tested in order to determine changes in IVD mechanics as a result of exposure to LPS and/or IVD puncture. All FSUs were subjected to cyclic mechanical loading in compression/tension using a displacement-controlled protocol. From the force displacement data obtained, the neutral zone (NZ) size (mm) and stiffness (MPa/mm) were calculated and compared. Four additional FSUs cultured for 6 days were subsequently used for histological analyses in order to visually identify changes to the structural properties. Media was collected and analyzed in order to quantify concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFa, IL- 6) and chemokines (MCP- 1, MIP 2, RANTES). Results: When collapsed across damage and media condition, NZ size increased and stiffness decreased from 24 hours to 6 days. Further, there was an increase in NZ size as a result of puncture, which is indicative of an increase in joint laxity. Interestingly, there was a decrease in NZ stiffness in the punctured FSUs observed at 24 hours however by 6 days, punctured FSUs were more stiff than the non-punctured FSUs indicating the presence of a potential reparative mechanism in the IVDs. All cytokines and chemokines measured in the media, regardless of condition, peaked at 24 hours and dropped off by 6 days. There was an interaction of media (LPS versus no LPS) and day (24 hours versus 6 days) where the FSUs placed in LPS had a higher concentration of TNFa and RANTES at 24 hours but no significant difference at 6 days. Comparatively, IL- 6 concentrations were higher in the control group at 6 days with no changes at 24 hours. Histological analysis showed proteoglycan staining in the <b>puncture</b> <b>tract,</b> AF inward bulging and disorganization in the control media/puncture group. Moreover, in the LPS/no puncture FSU there was a significant lack of proteoglycan staining in the NP. Discussion and Conclusion: This study demonstrated that punctured FSUs might initiate a reparative mechanism within the IVD that is not present in non-punctured FSUs. Further, the findings of this study indicate that the inflammatory profile created by LPS is different than the inflammation that might ensue as a result of IVD herniation. The increase in TNFa and RANTES in the LPS group and the increase in IL- 6 in the control group is different than what has been found in previous research and may be due to differences in the regulatory mechanisms of TNFÎ± and IL- 6 or due to differences in the dose dependent response to LPS exposur...|$|E
