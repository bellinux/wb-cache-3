Alternative enforcement – by contrast – entails a deviation from command-and-control style enforcement by using enforcement instruments and it can be characterised as informal, horizontal, compliance-based, restorative, preventative or efficient, or a combination of {{one or more of the}} above.

These instruments are evaluated in the light of procedural safeguards as well as requirements for instrumentality.
