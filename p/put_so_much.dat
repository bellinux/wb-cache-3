This was because the Japanese surrendered personnel had <b>put</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> effort to erect a memorial in the cemetery for their fallen comrades earlier and as such the memorial was a type of a shrine in itself as well as the fact that all ashes had been entombed in one single mound which made any form of identification impossible.|$|E

Secrets failed to sell because the record label went into receivership, curtailing promotion. After the failure of a project he had <b>put</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> work and time into, Oakey lost faith in the record industry and changed the band's focus to more lucrative live work. Between 2002 and the present day, they have toured regularly either on their own or as guests at festivals.

25|$|With {{the energy}} sector {{employing}} {{a huge number of}} Calgarians, the fallout from the economic slump of the early 1980s was significant, and the unemployment rate soared. By the end of the decade, however, the economy was in recovery. Calgary quickly realized that it could not afford to <b>put</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> emphasis on oil and gas, and the city has since become much more diverse, both economically and culturally. The period during this recession marked Calgary's transition from a mid-sized and relatively nondescript prairie city into a major cosmopolitan and diverse centre. This transition culminated in the city hosting Canada's first Winter Olympics in 1988. The success of these Games essentially put the city on the world stage.|$|E

500|$|With the Station to Station {{sessions}} {{completed in}} December 1975, Bowie started {{work on a}} soundtrack for The Man Who Fell to Earth with Paul Buckmaster as his collaborator. Bowie expected to be wholly responsible for the film's music but found that [...] "when I'd finished five or six pieces, I was then told that if I would care to submit my music along with some other people's... and I just said [...] "Shit, you're not getting any of it". I was so furious, I'd <b>put</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> work into it." [...] Notwithstanding, Harry Maslin argued that Bowie was [...] "burned out" [...] and could not complete the work in any case. The singer eventually collapsed, admitting later, [...] "There were pieces of me laying all over the floor". In the event, only one instrumental composed for the soundtrack saw the light of day, evolving into [...] "Subterraneans" [...] on his next studio album, Low.|$|E
500|$|David-Lloyd {{described}} the character's {{development in the}} third series as [...] "really exciting". He {{felt that it was}} [...] "great to be a fully-fledged member of the team now rather than just the administration man." [...] He felt flattered to have the writer and producers <b>put</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> confidence in him. In this series, the writers also explore Jones's background; David-Lloyd was happy with the execution of this backstory, through meeting Ianto's sister, and commented that it was quite beautifully written. Through meeting his family, we discover that his father has died and that Ianto has grown very distant from his relatives as per the demands of his job. David-Lloyd first concluded that Ianto was being killed off when his agent told him he was only needed for four out of five episodes. Although there was [...] "a bit of disappointment", he considers himself [...] "lucky" [...] for lasting so long on the series, especially since Ianto was supposed to die in series two. He believed the character's death was justified by [...] "the impact and the drama, and to keep the dangerous reality of Torchwood ever present". Although it was [...] "a tragedy that [...] died", David-Lloyd felt that the series had [...] "addressed everything about him that needed to be said".|$|E

When Sonic Team {{developed}} Nights into Dreams..., they were new to programming for the Sega Saturn, and when the engine was re-used for Burning Rangers {{they were able to}} make it faster and more capable. To design the stages and environments, Miyoshi outlined the corridors first, then placed fires in them before adding light effects to simulate the appearance of fire. Miyoshi thought that the team had over-reached in designing the game's detailed stages, saying: [...] "everyone in the team wanted to <b>put</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> into the game that we only completed about half of what we wanted to do." [...] Naka said that although they designed only four stages, they ensured that the player's experience would increase progressively throughout the game because each stage was very large. The developers initially used motion capture technology to capture data for poses and animation, but Naka soon discovered {{that it was impossible to}} get the results the team wanted, as it was unfeasible for people to perform the special motions they needed. The developers resorted to creating the animation by hand, and only used the motion capture data for the player characters' walking animations.|$|E

500|$|Producer Oren Koules told horror news website ShockTilYouDrop.com {{that there}} are eleven traps in the film, the most ever in the franchise. [...] There is one [...] "trap" [...] scene in the film that {{producers}} would not allow in previous Saw films that they described as [...] "too violent", [...] "too disgusting", and [...] "just wrong". [...] Melton later confirmed that was the [...] "Garage Trap", which involved a car and sets off a [...] "chain reaction" [...] with other characters. Gabby West {{was part of the}} trap. She told VH1, [...] "They molded my entire face, and basically my entire upper body after my belly button. They put layers and layers of different materials on you and you have two straws in your nose so you can breathe. It was so scary! They <b>put</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of it on, you can't see and they put it in your ears so you can barely hear anything. That was part of the prep for the film, which was really cool, to have a dummy made of yourself. But scary." [...] Over 25 gallons of fake blood was used in the film, which was two and half times more than Saw II.|$|E
500|$|The nudity was {{optional}} for the performers. The French cast was [...] "the nudest" [...] of {{the foreign}} groups, while the London cast [...] "found nudity the hardest to achieve." [...] The Swedish cast was reluctant to disrobe, but in Copenhagen, the tribe thought the nudity too tame and decided to walk naked {{up and down the}} aisle during the show's prelude. In some early performances, the Germans played their scene behind a big sheet labeled [...] "CENSORED". Original Broadway cast member Natalie Mosco said, [...] "I was dead set against the nude scene at first, but I remembered my acting teacher having said that part of acting is being private in public. So I did it." [...] According to Melba Moore, [...] "It doesn't mean anything except what you want it to mean. We <b>put</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> value on clothing. .... It's like so much else people get uptight about." [...] Donna Summer, who was in the German production, said that [...] "it was not meant to be sexual. ... We stood naked to comment on the fact that society makes more of nudity than killing." [...] Rado said that [...] "being naked in front of an audience, you're baring your soul. [...] Not only the soul but the whole body was being exposed. It was very apt, very honest and almost necessary." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening {{sequence}} of the episode was meant to replicate the same idea of season 2's premiere [...] "Man of Science, Man of Faith", where {{what seems to be}} a flashback is instead set on a new part of the island. Director Jack Bender questioned what Jack's goal was when he pulled on the chain, but Lindelof told him not to worry, because [...] "Fox will sell it, and he did". Lindelof described when Jack attacks his father at the AA meeting as [...] "pot-committed... it basically means you <b>put</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money on the bluff, you can't fold your cards". The scene with Kate in a dress was inspired by Raiders of the Lost Ark, where Belloq gives a dress for Marion Ravenwood to wear, and was intended to make [...] "tom-boyish" [...] Kate feel vulnerable. The title, inspired by Charles Dickens' eponymous novel, refers to the reveal of another [...] "city" [...] on the island with the place where the Others live, in addition to the castaways' beach camp. The episode has only three characters of the second season's main cast, Jack, Kate and Sawyer. Lindelof later described this limited scope as [...] "a mistake, when the audience is away from the show for that long, they want to see everybody", causing the following season openers to have scenes with most of the main characters.|$|E

500|$|Several co-stars found Steiger difficult; Warren Oates, {{according}} to director Norman Jewison, viewed Steiger as [...] "somebody {{who had a}} tendency to go over the top" [...] during the making of In The Heat of the Night. Writer Richard Dyer highlights the contrast in the film between the acting styles of Steiger and Poitier, with [...] "Poitier's stillness and implied intensity" [...] and [...] "Steiger's busy, exteriorised method acting". Humphrey Bogart, Steiger's co-star of The Harder They Fall, referred to Steiger's method acting as the [...] "scratch-your-ass-and-mumble school of acting". Director Robert Aldrich notes that Steiger had a habit of changing his lines, which often confused his co-stars. Aldrich stated: [...] "Usually I lie awake at nights trying to think of ways to improve an actor's performance. With Steiger, the problem is to try and contain him". Steiger was particularly aggressive towards director Kenneth Annakin during the making of Across the Bridge, insisting on rewriting most of the script and changing many of the lines to better fit Steiger's idea of the character. Annakin stated that he had [...] "never known an actor to <b>put</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> thought and preparation into a performance" [...] as Steiger. Hutchinson revealed that Steiger often suffered from panic during filming and that fear of failure haunted him throughout his life, but fear also provided him with a source of strength in his acting.|$|E

When she walks in, she can't believe what she's looking at..." [...] Sarah tried to recover from this and Batley said: [...] "I don't think she got over Rhys, either. Craig more so, though. He absolutely destroyed her happiness and belief in men. Her relationship with Craig was going to be her life and she <b>put</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> effort into it, emotionally and physically, and it completely destroyed her." [...] Batley said Sarah could not handle the fact he cheated on her with another man. She opined this was the reason her storyline with Zoe and Lydia worked well. However John Paul's betrayal also had impact on Sarah's life because he was one of her best friends. Batley said: [...] "John Paul was her confidante and she thought they were best friends - it's hard to say which part made more of an impact on her. It was all just one horrible experience.

5000|$|USA Today {{wrote that}} the film [...] "employs {{intriguing}} camera angles to heighten some of the suspense. It's too bad the movie goes {{over the top and}} falls apart in the last third."

2500|$|Pelléas {{was to be}} Debussy's only {{completed}} opera. For {{this reason}} it has sometimes been compared to Beethoven's Fidelio.

[...] This was not for want of trying on Debussy's part, and he worked hard to create a successor. Details of several opera projects survive.

They are {{a form of}} government bureaucracy in one sense but, unlike government agencies, public benefit corporations are exempt from some regulations. Of particular importance, they can take out their own debt, allowing them to bypass legal limits on state debt. This allows them to make potentially risky capital and infrastructure investments without <b>putting</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of the credit of New York on the line.

Nevertheless, in addition to revealing Helen's true desires, the self-expression of her artwork also defines her as an artist. That she <b>puts</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of herself into her paintings and drawings attests to this self-definition.|$|R
