2500|$|Prior to {{and during}} the war, Beria {{directed}} Sarkisov to keep a running list of the names and <b>phone</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> his sexual encounters. Eventually he ordered Sarkisov to destroy the list {{because it was a}} security risk, but the colonel retained a secret handwritten copy. When Beria's fall from power began, Sarkisov passed the list to Viktor Abakumov, the former wartime head of SMERSH. He was now chief of the MGB – the successor to the NKVD – who was already aggressively building a case against Beria. Stalin, who was also seeking to undermine Beria, was thrilled by the detailed records kept by Sarkisov, demanding: [...] "Send me everything this asshole writes down!" [...] Sarkisov reported that Beria's sexual appetite had led to him contracting syphilis during the war, for which he was secretly treated without the knowledge of Stalin or the Politburo (a fact Beria later admitted during his interrogation). Although the Russian government acknowledged Sarkisov's handwritten list of Beria's victims on 17 January 2003, the victims' names will not be released until 2028.|$|E
