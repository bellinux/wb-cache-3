MethodsNucleotide and/or amino acid sequences of HA gene of fifty-four ME 2009 H 1 N 1 pdm isolates were retrieved from GenBank Database by using Basic BLAST engine. Phylogenetic trees were established for both nucleotide and amino acid sequences using the muscle algorithm of the computer program CLC free workbench 5. 6. 1 JRE software.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to develop adenovirus-vectored prototype vaccines against two pathogens, African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) and Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV), which cause disease in two major livestock species, swine and cattle respectively. The African Swine Fever Virus is a transboundary animal pathogen that causes a lethal hemorrhagic fever in domestic pigs. Attempts to develop a vaccine for ASFV have failed thus far. This manuscript describes the use of recombinant adenovirus to deliver two unique formulations of ASFV antigens in swine (in two separate in-vivo studies) and the subsequent evaluation of the antigen-specific antibody and cellular responses induced. The robust antigen-specific immune responses observed in both studies are promising and their protective potential will be evaluated in future efficacy studies The Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus is a globally prevalent pathogen that can cause severe diarrhea, respiratory disease, abortions and sometimes death in calves. Killed and modified live vaccines (MLV) for BVDV have been in use since the 1960 s but are not effective {{due to lack of}} cross-protection and retention of immunosuppressive characteristics. This thesis also describes the use of the recombinant adenovirus vector to deliver a cocktail of multiple mosaic BVDV antigens in calves followed by the evaluation of protection conferred upon challenge.

40|$|Background: The rapid {{spread of}} the 2009 H 1 N 1 {{pandemic}} influenza virus (pH 1 N 1) highlighted problems associated with relying on strain-matched vaccines. A lengthy process of strain identification, manufacture, and testing is required for current strain-matched vaccines and delays vaccine availability.

Here we test two <b>prototype</b> <b>vaccines</b> for cross-protection against the recent pandemic virus. Methodology/Principal Findings: BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6 mice were intranasally immunized with a single dose of coldadapted (ca) influenza viruses from 1977 or recombinant adenoviruses (rAd) expressing 1934 nucleoprotein (NP) and consensus matrix 2 (M 2) (NP+M 2 -rAd). Antibodies against the M 2 ectodomain (M 2 e) were seen in NP+M 2 -rAd immunized BALB/c but not C 57 BL/ 6 mice, and cross-reacted with pH 1 N 1 M 2 e. The ca-immunized mice did not develop antibodies against M 2 e. Despite sequence differences between vaccine and challenge virus NP and M 2 e epitopes, extensive crossreactivity of lung T cells with pH 1 N 1 peptides was detected following immunization.

40|$|Dengue is {{a rapidly}} {{emerging}} vector-borne viral disease of humans transmitted by mosquitoes {{of the genus}} Aedes. Dengue viruses are divided into five antigenically distinct serotypes, DENV- 1 to - 5. The disease is endemic in over 130 countries, placing {{almost half of the}} world’s population at risk. Clinical disease presents as either a mild self-limiting infection or severe complications. Recovery from primary infection by one serotype provides life-long immunity against reinfection by that particular serotype whereas with subsequent infections by other serotypes the risk of developing severe dengue is increased. In contrast to previous understanding that immature dengue virus particles are non-infective it was shown recently that they become highly infectious in the presence of antibodies raised to the pre-membrane protein, prM, of the virion. While no licensed dengue treatment is currently available, several <b>prototype</b> <b>vaccines</b> are being evaluated in clinical studies. Most of these vaccine candidates contain native dengue prM, the presence of which can have the opposite effect to that desired by making immature dengue particles infective. This occurs through a mechanism of prM-specific antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Hence, in order to safeguard patient welfare when designing future dengue vaccine constructs, provision of another anti-idiotype antibody that binds to and blocks the pathogen-activating region of anti-prM antibody, thus rendering it inactive, should be considered as an adjunct therapy. This strategy would have a potentially significant benefit by reducing cases of secondary infection, which is the major cause of dengue morbidity and mortality...|$|R

Moreover, goats may represent a cheaper alternative for testing of <b>prototype</b> <b>vaccines</b> in large ruminants and humans. With this aim, a Mycobacterium caprae infection model has been developed in goats. Eleven 6 -month-old goats were infected by the endobronchial route with 1. 5 × 103 CFU, and two other goats were kept as noninfected controls. The animals were monitored for clinical and immunological parameters throughout the experiment. After 14 weeks, the goats were euthanized, and detailed postmortem analysis of lung lesions was performed by multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and direct observation. The respiratory lymph nodes were also evaluated and cultured for bacteriological analysis. All infected animals were positive in a single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test at 12 weeks postinfection (p. i.). Gamma interferon (IFN-γ) antigen-specific responses were detected from 4 weeks p. i. {{until the end of the}} experiment. The humoral response to MPB 83 was especially strong at 14 weeks p. i.

The genomes of these two vaccine strains have been sequenced, annotated, and compared with their prototype equivalents {{with the goals of}} understanding their genomes for molecular diagnostics applications, vaccine redevelopment, and HAdV pathoepidemiology. These reference genomes are archived in GenBank as HAdV- 4 vac (35, 994 bp; AY 594254) and HAdV- 7 vac (35, 240 bp; AY 594256). Bioinformatics and comparative whole-genome analyses with their recently reported and archived prototype genomes reveal six mismatches and four insertions-deletions (indels) between the HAdV- 4 <b>prototype</b> and <b>vaccine</b> strains, in contrast to the 611 mismatches and 130 indels between the HAdV- 7 <b>prototype</b> and <b>vaccine</b> strains. Annotation reveals that the HAdV- 4 vac and HAdV- 7 vac genomes contain 51 and 50 coding units, respectively. Neither vaccine strain appears to be attenuated for virulence based on bioinformatics analyses. There is evidence of genome recombination, as the inverted terminal repeat of HAdV- 4 vac is initially identical to that of species C whereas the prototype is identical to species B 1. These vaccine reference sequences yield unique genome signatures for molecular diagnostics. As a molecular forensics application, these references identify the circulating and problematic 1950 s era field strains as the original HAdV- 4 prototype and the Greider prototype, from which the vaccines are derived. Thus, they are useful for genomic comparisons to current epidemic and reemerging field strains, as well as leading to an understanding of pathoepidemiology among the human adenoviruses...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{attenuated}} vaccines for {{respiratory syncytial virus}} (RSV) historically focused on viruses made sensitive to physiologic temperature through point mutations in the genome. These <b>prototype</b> <b>vaccines</b> were not suitable for human infants primarily because of insufficient attenuation, genetic instability, and reversion to a less-attenuated phenotype. We therefore sought to construct novel attenuated viruses with less potential for reversion through genetic alteration of the attachment G protein. Complete deletion of G protein was previously shown to result in RSV strains overly attenuated for replication in mice. Using reverse genetics, recombinant RSV (rRSV) strains were engineered with truncations at amino acid 118, 174, 193, or 213 and respectively designated rA 2 cpΔG 118, rA 2 cpΔG 174, rA 2 cpΔG 193, and rA 2 cpΔG 213. All rA 2 cpΔG strains were attenuated for growth in vitro and in the respiratory tracts of BALB/c mice but not restricted for growth at 37 °C. The mutations did not significantly affect nascent genome synthesis in human lung epithelial (A 549) cells, but infectious rA 2 cpΔG virus shed into the culture medium was dramatically diminished. Hence, the data suggested that a site within the C-terminal 85 amino acids of G protein is important for efficient genome packaging or budding of RSV from the infected cell. Vaccination with the rA 2 cpΔG strains also generated efficacious immune responses in mice that {{were similar to those}} elicited by the temperature-sensitive cpts 248 / 404 strain previously tested in human infants.

The successful high-throughput {{generation of the}} complete genome sequence was achieved for 33 diverse RVF virus strains collected from throughout Africa and Saudi Arabia from 1944 to 2000, including strains differing in pathogenicity in disease models. While several distinct virus genetic lineages were determined, which approximately correlate with geographic origin, multiple exceptions indicative of long-distance virus movement have been found. Virus strains isolated within an epidemic (e. g., Mauritania, 1987, or Egypt, 1977 to 1978) exhibit little diversity, while those in enzootic settings (e. g., 1970 s Zimbabwe) can be highly diverse. In addition, the large Saudi Arabian RVF outbreak in 2000 appears to have involved virus introduction from East Africa, based on the close ancestral relationship of a 1998 East African virus. Virus genetic diversity was low (∼ 5 %) and primarily involved accumulation of mutations {{at an average of}} 2. 9 × 10 − 4 substitutions/site/year, although some evidence of RNA segment reassortment was found.

Relative efficacy of ECAMs was compared by inducing an antibody response in fish via injection (ip), immersion (im) or by ECAMs. Results showed that ECAMs were as effective as ip and im in inducing an antibody response to lipopolysaccharde and protein antigens. ECAMs were able to protect the protein antigen from gastric degradation. The ECAMs were employed to deliver a <b>prototype</b> <b>vaccine</b> for Renibacterium salmoninarum (Rs), the etiological agent of bacterial kidney disease. Upon characterization of the Rs antigens, one predominant cellassociated and extracellular protein (ECP), p 57 was identified. The p 57 molecule is elaborated in high concentrations in infected fish and exhibits pathogenic activitiesin vitro which appear to suppress the immune response. Our studies have revealed that a 370 C incubation of R. salmoninarum cells decreased the amount of p 57 by the induction of an autoproteolytic activity. This activity was exploited to produce a <b>prototype</b> <b>vaccine</b> that was delivered by intraperitoneal injection (ip) and demonstrated a significant increase in mean time of death upon challenge by injection. A second experiment was conducted using a natural exposure (bath challenge) and the heat treated, p 57 -Rs cells were delivered using ECAMs and ip administration. The results proved that the route of immunization was critical with respect to natural exposure, as animals that received ECAMs with heat-treated p 57 minus As cells demonstrated statistically significant reduction in the amount of ECP detected versus control. The decrease in ECP concentration is indicative of reduced Rs infection. Those animals vaccinated by ip showed no difference. Finally, in order to assess immunological memory induced by antigenic stimulation, an assay was developed that measured the production of cytokines induced by in vivo priming and subsequent in vitro exposure with the specific antigen...|$|E
40|$|Following the {{introduction}} of effective protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines against capsular group C meningococcal disease in Europe, meningococci of capsular group B remain {{a major cause of}} death and can result in debilitating sequelae. The outer membrane proteins PorA and FetA have previously been shown to induce bactericidal antibodies in humans. Despite considerable antigenic variation among PorA and FetA OMPs in meningo-cocci, systematic molecular epidemiological studies revealed this variation is highly struc-tured so that a limited repertoire of antigenic types is congruent with the hyperinvasive meningococcal lineages that have caused most of the meningococcal disease in Europe in recent decades. Here we describe the development of a <b>prototype</b> <b>vaccine</b> against capsular group B meningococcal infection based on a N. meningitidis isolate genetically engineered to have constitutive expression of the outer membrane protein FetA. Deoxycholate outer membrane vesicles (dOMVs) extracted from cells cultivated in modified Frantz medium con-tained 21. 8 % PorA protein, 7. 7 % FetA protein and 0. 03 μg LPS per μg protein (3 %). The antibody response to the vaccine was tested in three mouse strains and the toxicologica...|$|E

Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout {{are two of the}} most cultured aquaculture species. A pathogen that threatens these species is salmonid alphavirus (SAV). A current inactivated virus vaccine against SAV provides cross-protection against all SAV subtypes in salmonids and reduces mortality amongst infected fish. However, protection is not 100 % and due to virus growth at low temperature, the vaccine production process is time consuming. In addition, the vaccine needs to be injected into the fish, which is a cumbersome process. The work described in this thesis aimed to increase the general knowledge of SAV and to assess current vaccine technologies, and to use this knowledge in designing next-generation vaccines for salmonid aquaculture. An alternative cell line to support SAV proliferation was identified, however, the virus production time could not yet outcompete the current SAV production system. Making use of the baculovirus insect cell expression system, multiple enveloped virus-like particle (eVLP), and core-like particle (CLP) <b>prototype</b> <b>vaccines</b> were produced in insect cells at high temperature. An in vivo vaccination study showed, however, that these vaccines could not readily protect Atlantic salmon against SAV. The low temperature-dependent replication of SAV was attributed to the glycoprotein E 2, and it was found that E 2 only correctly travelled to the cell surface at low temperature, and in the presence of glycoprotein E 1. The biological impact of this finding was confirmed in the development and in vivo testing of a DNA-launched replicon vaccine. The effective DNA-launched replicon vaccine was extended by delivery of the capsid protein in trans. It was hypothesized that viral replicon particles (VRP) were formed in vivo, which would cause an additional single round of infection and might further elevate the immune response in comparison to the replicon vaccine. A second animal trial indicated that the inclusion of capsid did not yet improve vaccine efficacy. This trial however did show that a DNA vaccine transiently expressing the SAV structural proteins provided superior protection over both replicon vaccines (with and without capsid). In this thesis, some virus characteristics, such as the cause of temperature-dependency of SAV replication, of an unique aquatic virus were further explored. The production and in vivo testing of multiple next-generation vaccines defined the prerequisites for induction of a potent immune response in Atlantic salmon. A <b>prototype</b> DNA-launched replicon <b>vaccine</b> has shown potential for further development. The research described in this thesis contributes to the development of next-generation vaccines in the challenging area of fish vaccinology...|$|R
40|$|Current {{immunisation}} programmes against hepatitis B virus (HBV) increasingly often involve novel tri-component vaccines containing—together {{with the}} small (S-HBsAg) —also medium and large surface antigens of HBV (M- and L-HBsAg). Plants producing all HBsAg proteins can {{be a source of}} components for a potential oral ‘triple’ anti-HBV vaccine. The objective of the presented research was to study the potential of M/L-HBsAg expression in leaf tissue and conditions of its processing for a <b>prototype</b> oral <b>vaccine.</b> Tobacco and lettuce carrying M- or L-HBsAg genes and resistant to the herbicide glufosinate were engineered and integration of the transgenes was verified by PCR and Southern hybridizations. M- and L-HBsAg expression was confirmed by Western blot and assayed by ELISA at the level of micrograms per g of fresh weight. The antigens displayed a common S domain and characteristic domains preS 2 and preS 1 and were assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs). Leaf tissues containing M- and L-HBsAg were lyophilised to produce a starting material of an orally administered vaccine formula. The antigens were distinctly sensitive to freeze-drying conditions and storage temperature, in the aspect of stability of S and preS domains and formation of multimeric particles. Efficiency of lyophilisation and storage depended also on the initial antigen content in plant tissue, yet M-HBsAg appeared to be approximately 1. 5 – 2 times more stable than L-HBsAg. The results of the study provide indications concerning the preparation of two other constituents, next to S-HBsAg, for a plant-derived <b>prototype</b> oral tri-component <b>vaccine</b> against hepatitis B...|$|R
