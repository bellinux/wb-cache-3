A number of {{conditions such as}} temperature and salt concentration are combined to create balanced, low-strin-gency conditions that permit a normalized amplification of a diversified, random set of sequences. On average, 350 different se-quences are obtained per mini-library, which represents a significantly higher di-versity of messages per library when com-pared to previously <b>published</b> <b>conditions</b> (i. e., 20 – 40 sequences/mini-library).

It focuses mainly on textual and editorial care given to samizdat typescripts. The first part describes the samizdat self-reflection in the articles from the typewritten periodical Kritický sborník from the 80 's. The second part engages in samizdat Edice Expedice and examines how its production was processed by publishers under <b>publishing</b> <b>conditions</b> after the year 1989. It analyzes mainly two aspects - handling with samizdat sources described in editorial comments, possibly what it means for the textual quality of samizdat publications, and if the authentic literary historical context of the works is properly conveyed in the new published books.

Carr's study group concluded that Stalin had largely abandoned Communist ideology in favour of Russian nationalism, that the Soviet economy would provide {{a higher standard of}} living in the Soviet Union after the war, and it was both possible and desirable for Britain to reach a friendly understanding with the Soviets once the war had ended.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of the existence, {{uniqueness}} and global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point for the class of neural networks with multiple time delays and parameter uncertainties. Under the assumption that the activation functions are globally Lipschitz continuous, we derive a new criterion for the robust stability of a class of delayed neural networks by utilizing the Lyapunov stability theorems and the Homomorphic mapping theorem. Different from those previously <b>published</b> <b>conditions</b> in the recent literature, the robust stability result presented in this paper not only establishes a time-independent relationship between the network parameters of the neural network, but also takes into account the number the neurons of the designed neural system. Some illustrative numerical examples are also given to make a detailed comparison between our result and the previously published corresponding results. This comparison proves that our result is new and can be considered an alternative condition to those of the previously reported robust stability results. Publisher's Versio...|$|R
40|$|The HN- 1 module was {{previously}} reported to ensure efficient targeting of {{head and neck}} squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Aim of this work was to indentify the target of HN- 1. Targeting of HN- 1 peptide was compared in normal epithelial cells (BEAS- 2 B) and in HNSCC tumor cells (SCC- 25 and Detroit 562). Experimental, cell culture, cell polarity, and adhesion conditions were tested; structure models of peptides were created. Indeed, HN- 1 was able to target HNSCC tumor cells in the previously <b>published</b> <b>conditions.</b> The targeting efficiency of immortalized normal epithelial cells was significantly lower. Nevertheless, in other experimental conditions the binding was less efficient and not specific. A scrambled sequence of HN- 1, with altered order of amino acids showed even better targeting efficiency than HN- 1. HN- 1 was only uptaken in adherent cells, not in suspension. In conclusion, HN- 1 -peptide-targeting {{is not based on}} sequence specificity, but more on electrostatic interactions with the cell surface of the tumor cells...|$|R
5000|$|An {{instructional}} theory is [...] "a theory that offers explicit guidance {{on how to}} better help people learn and develop." [...] Instructional theories focus on how to structure material for promoting the education of human beings, particularly youth. Originating in the United States in the late 1970s, {{instructional theory}} is influenced by three basic theories in educational thought: behaviorism, the theory that helps us understand how people conform to predetermined standards; cognitivism, the theory that learning occurs through mental associations; and constructivism, the theory explores the value of human activity as a critical function of gaining knowledge. Instructional theory is heavily influenced by the 1956 work of Benjamin Bloom, a University of Chicago professor, {{and the results of}} his Taxonomy of Education Objectives—one of the first modern codifications of the learning process. One of the first instructional theorists was Robert M. Gagne, who in 1965 <b>published</b> <b>Conditions</b> of Learning for the Florida State University's Department of Educational Research.|$|R

30|$|But {{it is also}} {{uncertain}} {{whether it should be}} reproduced in the same way. Changed <b>publishing</b> <b>conditions</b> in digital media offered some new options that hitherto have not been available by publications in books and journals: digital storage and hyperlinks enable to amend contents and to bring them into new contexts. This does not only support a faster and more systematic supply of information, it also allows for subsequent commenting on already published texts at the same place. For example, the comment stating that the repetition of a certain experiment has not led to the same results can be immediately “added” to the article that describes it for the first time. And the comment that a certain interpretation of a classical citation holds plausible only by disregarding its immediate context can be attached directly to its proposition. In traditional publishing organs, commentaries would have been mentioned in some later edition of the same or another journal, only perceptible by chance or for those who invest {{a lot of time in}} systematic scans of their discipline’s periodicals.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn 1945 Yves Le Grand <b>published</b> <b>conditions,</b> now largely forgotten, on the 4 × 4 {{matrix of}} an {{astigmatic}} {{eye for the}} eye to be emmetropic and an additional condition for retinal images to be undistorted. The conditions also applied to the combination of eye and the lens used {{to compensate for the}} refractive error. The conditions were presented with almost no justification. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to use linear optics to derive such conditions. It turns out that Le Grand’s conditions are correct for sharp images but his condition such that the images are undistorted prove to be neither necessary nor sufficient in general although they are necessary but not sufficient in most situations of interest in optometry and vision science. A numerical example treats a model eye which satisfies Le Grand’s condition of no distortion and yet forms elliptical and noncircular images of distant circles on the retina. The conditions for distant object are generalized to include the case of objects at finite distances, a case not examined by Le Grand...|$|R
40|$|Ella Hepworth Dixon {{took on the}} editorship of {{the monthly}} {{magazine}} the Englishwoman between March and August 1895 at an exciting {{moment in the history}} of women's involvement in the periodical press. This essay seeks to shed as much light as possible on Dixon's editorship, seeing the choices she makes about contributors, content and style as fundamentally influenced by her wide-reaching understanding of female roles at the fin de siècle. Throughout her life, both before and after working on the Englishwoman, Dixon was interested in editorship: the methods by which editors worked, the relationships forged with their contributors {{and the ways in which}} the editorial role might adapt to changes in <b>publishing</b> <b>conditions.</b> Thinking carefully about editorship—in her magazine and in her fiction—also entailed considering the varying expectations held about women's roles in the periodical press. The six months of Dixon's editorship of the Englishwoman gives us a window into late-century female journalistic endeavour that differs markedly from the narrative of drudgery lacking editorial opportunity or authorial autonomy which she had provided in The Story of a Modern Woman the year before...|$|R
