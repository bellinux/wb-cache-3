5|$|After 1914, the Church of God in Christ {{would become}} {{predominantly}} {{black and the}} Assemblies of God would remain <b>predominantly</b> <b>white.</b> However, there were African Americans involved {{in the early years}} of the Assemblies of God. The African-American pastor Garfield Thomas Haywood, for example, pastored one of the largest churches and was an influential voice within the fellowship until he withdrew from the denomination after 1916.|$|E

25|$|Between 1930 and 1960, {{moderate}} and upper income Bronxites (<b>predominantly</b> non-Hispanic <b>Whites)</b> began to relocate from the southwestern neighborhoods of the borough. This migration {{has left a}} mostly poor African American and Hispanic (largely Puerto Rican) population in the West Bronx. One significant factor that shifted the racial and economic demographics was the construction of Co-op City, built {{with the intent of}} housing middle-class residents in family-sized apartments. The high-rise complex {{played a significant role in}} draining middle-class residents from older tenement buildings in the borough's southern and western fringes. Most <b>predominantly</b> non-Hispanic <b>White</b> communities today are located in the eastern and northwestern sections of the borough.|$|R

Because British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and Whitehall had been insisting on an immediate transfer to majority rule before independence, this declaration went unrecognised and caused Britain and the United Nations (UN) to impose economic sanctions on Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, Donaldson made a then-controversial move {{by hiring}} an African-American {{journalist}} James Albert Jackson {{to write a}} weekly column devoted to African-American performers. According to The Business of Culture: Strategic Perspectives on Entertainment and Media, the column identified discrimination against black performers and helped validate their careers. Jackson {{was the first black}} critic at a national magazine with a <b>predominantly</b> <b>white</b> audience. According to his grandson, Donaldson also established a policy against identifying performers by their race. Donaldson died in 1925.|$|E
5|$|In the 11th century, William the Conqueror {{brought the}} Talbot hound to Britain. The Talbot was a <b>predominantly</b> <b>white,</b> slow, deep-throated, scent hound {{derived from the}} St. Hubert Hound which had been {{developed}} in the 8th century. At some point the English Talbots were crossed with Greyhounds {{to give them an}} extra turn of speed.

5|$|The road {{has long}} {{served as a}} de facto {{cultural}} dividing line between the predominantly poor black city and its wealthier, <b>predominantly</b> <b>white</b> northern suburbs. The perception of 8Mile as the chief dividing line between racial groups and classes persists, {{in part because the}} suburban counties of Oakland and Macomb remain, on the whole, significantly whiter and more prosperous than the city of Detroit. However, in recent years increasing numbers of whites have moved into Detroit, especially around the downtown area, and other neighborhoods in the region have become more ethnically diverse as well.|$|E

5|$|Adult {{males and}} juveniles are quite {{different}} in appearance to the female. They are smaller in size, being about one sixth {{the size of an}} adult female. Juveniles have a brown carapace, with a <b>predominantly</b> <b>white</b> abdomen which has a series of red-orange diamonds running along the dorsal region bordered on either side by irregular black lines. Males retain this coloration into adulthood. Due to its much smaller size, Urquhart (1886) believed the male to be a separate species and named it Theridion melanozantha. This was not rectified until 1933 when it was correctly identified as the male Latrodectus katipo.|$|E
