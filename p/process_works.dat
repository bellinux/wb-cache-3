One example of this type of initiative is the nonprofit organization Living Solutions, which is located in downtown San Diego, CA.

The initiative also builds community empowerment by asking formerly homeless residents to help to maintain and repair these homes.

25|$|Photovoltaic assay : The {{photovoltaic}} assay, {{used only}} in the dated Photo Electric Intoximeter (PEI), {{is a form of}} breath testing rarely encountered today. The <b>process</b> <b>works</b> by using photocells to analyze the color change of a redox (oxidation-reduction) reaction. A breath sample is bubbled through an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid, potassium dichromate, and silver nitrate. The silver nitrate acts as a catalyst, allowing the alcohol to be oxidized at an appreciable rate. The requisite acidic condition needed for the reaction might also be provided by the sulfuric acid. In solution, ethanol reacts with the potassium dichromate, reducing the dichromate ion to the chromium (III) ion. This reduction results in a change of the solution's color from red-orange to green. The reacted solution is compared to a vial of non-reacted solution by a photocell, which creates an electric current proportional to the degree of the color change; this current moves the needle that indicates BAC. Like other methods, breath testing devices using chemical analysis are somewhat prone to false readings. Compounds that have compositions similar to ethanol, for example, could also act as reducing agents, creating the necessary color change to indicate increased BAC.|$|E
