40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{relationship}} between Teacher <b>Professional</b> <b>Competences</b> and Teacher Work-Autonomy. The purposes of this research were to investigate; first, what are Teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> of Sekolah Sukma Bangsa teachers in Aceh; second, what is Teacher work-autonomy of Sekolah Sukma Bangsa teachers in Aceh; third, what relationships can be found between teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> and Teacher Work-Autonomy and of Sekolah Sukma Bangsa teachers in Aceh; fourth, is there any difference in Teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> based on gender, school location, classroom teacher/subject teacher, grade level or teaching experiences; and, fifth, is there any difference in Teacher Work-Autonomy based on gender, school location, classroom teacher/subject teacher, grade level or teaching experiences. The thesis presents a quantitative research study carried in Aceh, Indonesia in 2016. The research data were collected through questionnaires. Seventy teachers participated in providing information for this research work. The participants completed two questionnaires on teachers work-autonomy and teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> Friedman s teacher work-autonomy construct measured teacher perceived autonomy, while Niemi s teachers <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> construct measured teacher perceived <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> Research results indicate that most teachers of Sekolah Sukma Bangsa in Aceh occupied moderate degree of teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> {{and most of the}} teachers attained a moderate degree of work-autonomy. This study results also claim that there was a moderate and positive correlation between teacher work-autonomy and teachers <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> The direction of correlation was positive and there was evidence found of correlation between Teacher work-autonomy and Teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> The results indicate that when level of teacher autonomy increase, the level of teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> escalated, and lower level of teacher autonomy is associated with lower level of teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> Supplying teacher with high level of work autonomy is one obvious way to upsurge teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> As degree of autonomy increased, degree of competences increased. On the opposite, when the score of autonomy decreased the score of <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> is decreased. Teacher autonomy was associated with teacher <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> Research results also indicate that a degree to which teachers perceived work-autonomy and a degree to which teachers perceived <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> were diverse based on gender, classroom/subject teacher, experience, level of school and location of school, even though the differentiations were not statistically significant. This research suggests that one way to increase teachers levels of <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> is by enhancing teachers degrees of autonomy in the schools. School administrators should consider decentralizing the power of decision making in school and accommodate teachers to participate autonomously in school activities both in the classroom area and the school wide area...|$|R

The main characteristics of the traditional system of physical training education in Russia’s high schools have been analyzed. In this system several contradictions are discovered: not-high quality of the competent approach realization; limited conditions of the formation and development of the students’ <b>professional</b> <b>competences,</b> which can be adequate to their future professional activity. In this connexion the authors declared, that it’s necessary to form and develop the <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> of the physical culture students during their preparation, training, leading, participating in the professional skills competitions. The article deals with the experiment to check up the result of the educational conditions, which promote the development of the physical culture students’ <b>professional</b> <b>competences.</b> The innovation is in the declaration, that forming and developing the <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> of the physical culture students must be realized during their preparation, training, leading, participating in the professional skills competitions.

Mokslinės literatūros apžvalga leidžia teigti, kad Lietuvoje vis dar stokojama teorinių / eksperimentinių studijų, skirtų ikimokyklinio ugdymo pedagogų kompetencijoms ir jų kaitos analizei. Jurašaitės-Harbison (2004, 2006, 2007) atlikti tyrimai bent iš dalies šią spragą užpildo, todėl remiantis šios autorės parengtu Lietuvos ikimokyklinio ugdymo pedagogų profesinių kompetencijų modeliu (2004) buvo atliktas diagnostinis tyrimas. Ikimokyklinio ugdymo pedagogų nuomonė apie jų profesinių kompetencijų sistemos reikšmingumą buvo analizuojama siejant ją su pedagogų įgytu išsilavinimu, kvalifikacijos tobulinimo kursų intensyvumu, gyvenamąja ir darbo vieta. The paper {{analyses}} <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> {{of preschool}} teachers. The concepts of general and <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> are argued and their {{importance for the}} education quality is discussed as well. Following the scientific data {{it is possible to}} state that there is still a great lack of both theoretical and empirical studies/surveys exploring preschool teachers’ <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> and their development. Jurasaite-Harbison’s (2004, 2006, and 2007) findings proposed the idea of diagnostic research organization. Thus the representations of preschool teachers’ attitudes towards the meaning of <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> were associated with their education obtained, the intensity of qualification improvement courses, and living/working place. While analyzing the empirical data, it was determined that such competences as educational wisdom, activity prognosis and planning, and educational communication and collaboration were mainly accepted as meaningful only by those teachers who have higher education degree and attend qualification improvement courses. Other competences, such as changes of preschool education and organization of educational process were evaluated rather highly by all preschool teachers despite their education degrees or intensity of qualification improvement course attendance. The results of the research show that teachers’ representations in terms of importance of <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> along with education quality are mainly determined by living/working place (local variable). Suburban area teachers have ranked the importance of <b>professional</b> <b>competences</b> much higher than their colleagues from larger cities. It is stated that the direction of ‘Collaborative Learning’ of learning in cooperation is closer to training for professional activity, which is a social action. The main premise of such learning in cooperation is based on agreement of members of a collaboration group, as well as formation of positive social interaction.
