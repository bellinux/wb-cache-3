From experiments carried out, typical representations of the total and transversal linear efficiencies show that when total efficiency is related to <b>push</b> <b>flow</b> rate, taking as a parameter the pull flow rate, a parabolic profile is obtained with a maximum point or plateau that increases as the pull flow increases. When the transversal linear efficiency is analysed, three general zones where losses occur to the exterior can be detected: (i) when the <b>push</b> <b>flow</b> rate is low, any distortion in the wall jet, whether external (e. g. in the air flow inside the workshop) or internal (e. g. thermal effects), provokes an escape from contam-inant; (ii) in the impact zone, where the <b>push</b> <b>flow</b> impacts on the tank surface, distortion increases as the <b>push</b> <b>flow</b> rate increases; (iii) when the push/pull flow rate ratio increases and preferential currents are produced inside the exhaust hood, these escape and cause substantial losses in efficiency...|$|R

40|$|A {{push-pull}} {{fume cupboard}} shown is an innovative device to remove pollutants from a fume cupboard to the outdoor environment. A <b>push</b> <b>flow</b> {{coming from the}} bottom of a sash and a pull flow behind the doorsill are adopted to form an air curtain in the fume cupboard. Meanwhile, the roof of a push-pull fume cupboard is open to the environment and ambient fluids are drawn from the roof. To investigate the performance of a push-pull fume cupboard, a numerical model based on the finite volume method is utilized. Various ratios of <b>push</b> <b>flows</b> to pull flows are considered. Four characteristic flow fields are found at a variety of speed ratios. They are concave curtain, straight curtain, under suction and over blow modes. According to numerical results, a concave curtain mode with a fast pull flow and a weak <b>push</b> <b>flow</b> is recommended for the operation of a push-pull fume hood. Furthermore, the manikin effect on the flow filed of a push-pull fume hood is also examined in this study. A manikin is located in front of the fume cupboard according to the ANSI/ASHRAE 110 / 1995 standard. Numerical results reveal that fluid flows in a push-pull fume cupboard are not affected by a manikin.

40|$|Abstract: Aeration is {{the process}} by which the area of contact between water and air is increased, either by natural methods or by {{mechanical}} devices. Proper aeration can make considerable improvements in a pond ecosystem. This paper investigates pond aeration by two phase <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> such as high head gated conduit <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> and two phase pipe <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> using venturi tubes. When the gate of a high head outlet conduit is partly opened or a minimal amount of differential pressure exists between the inlet and outlet sides of the venturi tube, air suction occurs at air vents. In two phase <b>flow</b> <b>systems,</b> air that is entrained into the water will be momentarily forced downstream in the form of small air bubbles. The dissolution of oxygen into the water results from the air suction downstream of high head gated conduit and venturi tube, and the rising air bubbles into pond. Moreover, high pressure in two phase <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> also facilitates the dissolution of oxygen into the water. Therefore, two phase <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> have an extremely high efficiency for transferring oxygen from air bubbles to water. It was observed from the results that two phase <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> were more efficient in deep ponds than in shallow ponds...|$|R

In the past five decades, many efficient algorithms for the maximum flow problem have emerged for a fixed network. The maximum flow algorithm was first investigated by Fulkerson and Dantzig [42] in 1955. Then, representative methods in maximum flow algorithms are based on either augmenting paths or preflows. Augmenting path algorithms <b>push</b> <b>flow</b> along a path from the source to the sink in the residual network and include Ford-Fulkerson’s labeling algorithm [43] and Dinic’s blocking flow algorithm [44]. Edmonds and Karp [45] also independently proposed that the Ford and Fulkerson algorithm augments flow along shortest paths. In order {{to reduce the number of}} augmentations, preflow-based algorithms <b>push</b> <b>flow</b> along edges were investigated in the residual network and include Karzanov’s blocking flow algorithms [46], which introduced the first preflow-push algorithm on layered networks, and Goldberg-Tarjan’s push-relabeling algorithm [10]; it constructed distance labels instead of layered networks to improve the running time of preflow-push algorithm. They described a very flexible generic preflow-push algorithm that performs push and relabel operations at active nodes. In short, for a classical network, the maximum flow can be calculated by above for any algorithms.|$|R
