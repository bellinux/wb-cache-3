40|$|Because {{of their}} simplicity, risk {{measures}} are often employed in financial risk evaluations and related decisions. In fact, the risk measure ρ(X) of a random variable X {{is a real}} number customarily determining {{the amount of money}} needed to face the potential losses X might cause.

The project aims at providing guidance on the design of cost-effective policy instruments to reduce financial dollarization, including selective prudential regulation and the development of attractive new markets and instruments in local currency. It focuses on domestic asset holders, as opposed to foreign investors, as the primary targets of a dedollarization strategy. This paper revisits the Chilean experience with dollarization, indexation and nominalization in the 1958 - 2003 period.

We are particularly interested to take up your reference to the activities of highly leveraged institutions in financial markets and their implications for the stability of markets and the conduct of economic policies.

(3) The virtually unlimited lending powers that the Fed has recently exercised in creating credit and helping individual institutions should be restricted in duration and subjected to formal Treasury approval backed by Congressional preauthorization of funds.

40|$|For {{credit risk}} {{management}} purposes in general, and for allocation of regulatory capital by banks in particular (Basel II), numerical assessments of creditworthiness are indispensable. These assessments {{are expressed in}} terms of probabilities of default (PD) that should incorporate a certain degree of conservatism in order to reflect the <b>prudential</b> <b>risk</b> management style banks are required to apply. In case of credit portfolios that did not at all suffer defaults or very few defaults only over years, the resulting naive zero or close to zero estimates would clearly not involve a sufficient conservatism. As an attempt to overcome this issue, we suggest the most prudent estimation principle. This means to estimate the PDs by upper confidence bounds while guaranteeing {{at the same time a}} PD ordering that respects the differences in credit quality indicated by the rating grades. The methodology is most easily applied under an assumption of independent default events but can be adapted to the case of correlated defaults without too much effort. ...|$|E

Based on simulations of implied values for credit worthiness {{over a period of}} 5 years for 1000 consumers, we establish a case for the semi-markov models as a proxy for internal credit risk models for a portfolio of consumer loans. With ample calibration, we prove the robustness of the semi-markov models in forecasting probabilities of default and loss given default. With a view of credit risk as a reliability problem, we generate credit risk indicators as qualifications of adequacy of a loan portfolio. This informs prospective holding of capital based on forecast delinquencies as opposed to the current retrospective practice that relies on the trigger event of default. We use Monte-Carlo simulation techniques to generate consumer ratings and adopt this to the Merton model to derive the initial probability transition matrix.

40|$|The {{financial}} services industry worldwide has undergone major transformation {{since the late}} 1970 s. Technological advancements in information processing and communication facilitated financial innovation and narrowed traditional distinctions in financial products and services, allowing them to become close substitutes for one another. The deregulation process in many major economies prior to the recent financial crisis blurred the traditional lines of demarcation between the distinct types of financial institutions, exposing those firms to new competitors in their traditional business areas, while the increasing globalization of financial markets fostered the provision of {{financial services}} across national borders. Against this backdrop, a trend toward consolidation across financial sectors as well as across national borders increasingly manifested itself since the 1990 s. The developments {{in the financial markets}} ever more intensified competition in the financial services industry and induced financial institutions to redefine their business strategies in search of higher profitability and growth opportunities. Consolidation across distinct financial sectors, i. e. financial conglomeration, in particular became a popular business strategy in light of the potential operational synergies and diversification benefits it can offer. This trend spurred the growth of diversified financial groups, the so-called financial conglomerates, which commingle banking, securities, and insurance activities under one corporate umbrella. 5 Still today, large, complex financial conglomerates are represented among major players in the financial markets worldwide, whose activities not only sway across traditional boundaries of banking, securities, and insurance sectors but also across national borders. Notwithstanding the economic benefits that conglomeration may produce as a business strategy, the emergence of financial conglomerates also exacerbated existing and created new <b>prudential</b> <b>risks</b> in the financial system. 6 The mixing of a variety of financial products and services under one corporate roof and the generally large and complex group structure of financial conglomerates expose such organizations to specific group risks such as contagion and arbitrage risk as well as systemic risk.

Furthermore, we highlight considerable implementation issues.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2004. Money {{laundering}} is the act {{of converting}} money gained from illegal activity, such as drug smuggling, into money that appears legitimate and in which the source cannot {{be traced to the}} illegal activi ty. Criminal proceeds also include that which is derived from tax evasion. Estimates of the scale of money laundering globally range between 2 and 5 % of the worlds Gross Domestic Product. Another study refers to money laundering as the third largest industry globally. Money laundering has devastating consequences for countries individually and for the global economy as a whole. Potential macroeconomic consequences include inexplicable changes in money demand, greater <b>prudential</b> <b>risks</b> to banks' soundness, contamination effects on legal financial transactions and greater volatility of international capital flows and exchange rates due to unanticipated cross-border asset transfers. A number of initiatives have been established for dealing with the problem at international level. Amongst the most significant is the formation of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a body that was established by the G- 7 nations in 1989 to develop a coordinated international 096572 response to money laundering. South Africa was recently accepted as a full member of the FAFT, having satisfied the FATF recommendations with the implementation of a Financial Intelligence Centre Act. The provisions of the Act came into effect on 1 June 2003. The Act imposes reporting obligations on accountable institutions like banks, insurance companies, estate agent and casinos. The Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) is established by the Act in order to identify the proceeds of unlawful activities and to combat money-laundering activi ties. It aims to do so by making information collected by it available to investigating authorities (South African Police, Scorpions, Asset Forfeiture Unit etc. including SARS). The FIC will in the course of its functions build up a database of information, which it will retain and utilise to support the above-mentioned bodies in the performance of their functions. The FICA creates a special relationship particularly with SARS. The FIC data will assist SARS to combat tax evasion and to collect taxes more effectively. The Act explicitly requires all institutions to report any transactions that may be relevant to the investigation of any evasion or attempted evasion of any tax, levy or duty. Money laundering by its very nature does not lend itself to being accurately measured but based on estimates discussed above, this can amount to a substantial loss to the fiscus. The estimated range of between 2 and 5 % of the world's GDP would translate to between R 24 and R 60 billion being laundered annually in South Africa. If one applies the minimum marginal tax rate of 18 %, one arrives at a potential loss of between R 4. 32 and RI 0. 8 billion to the fiscus. Whilst the new Financial Intelligence Centre Act cannot totally eradicate the laundering of undeclared or criminal proceeds, the many obligations now placed on accountable institutions in terms of the Act is most likely to be a further deterrent or obstacle to tax evasion...|$|R

40|$|The Detailed Assessment of Antigua and Barbuda’s {{compliance}} with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision is presented. The largest bank represents 61 percent of the sector’s aggregated assets, highlighting an important degree of concentration. Investment portfolios represent the bulk of banks’ assets, and are predominantly composed of government and corporate bonds and equities. Loan portfolios include a number of large exposures, some exceeding 25 percent of capital, and/or connected party loans.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} I {{analyzed}} Romania's banking system {{evolution in the}} period 2000 – 2012, through a research both theoretical and empirical. The database is collected from monthly Reports of National Bank of Romania and is classified into categories as follows: key <b>prudential</b> indicators, banking <b>risk</b> information, loans and commitments granted by banks, loan portfolio classification and key ratio for minimum reserves. Afterwards, those indicators are framed through CAMELS approach. The research period was divided into pre-crisis period - before 2007 and post-crisis period - after 2007 {{and up to the}} present. The 2007 year was used as a crossroad point because starting with this year it was visible the downturn of the economic and financial evolution in Romania's system and also at global level. The research objectives are to observe the evolution of the banking system in Romania in the prior crisis period as well as after the crisis set in and to identify possible correlations and contagion effects of the selected indicators. Concluding, there are cross sectional influences between selected banking indicators which might gave us a warning signal regarding the evolution of the banking system...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we analyze {{credit growth}} in Sub-Saharan Africa {{over the past}} decade {{focusing}} on the post- 2002 rapid credit growth in select countries. We develop regression models of the fundamental determinants of bank credit and use them to examine whether they can fully explain developments in rapid credit growth countries. We then argue that rapid credit expansion, whether a manifestation of a credit boom or driven by fundamentals, can give rise to <b>prudential</b> and macroeconomic <b>risks.</b> We detail these risks and discuss the choice of policies to mitigate them. We conclude by evaluating the likely impact of the ongoing global recession and financial crisis on credit growth in Sub-Saharan Africa.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop {{the case for}} the {{creation}} of a single financial supervisory and regulatory authority for the Russian Federation. This case is based on three criteria: (a) it enables economies of scope to be exploited (b) it ensures regulatory parity (c) it satisfies <b>prudential</b> logic The <b>risk</b> management function in banks, investment firms and insurance companies has become extremely complex utilising sophisticated statistical methodologies to analyse market data and credit ratings. Given the need for each of the three sectors to manage their risks using similar data and similar methodologies, there are economies of scope for regulators to adopt a comprehensive approach. This will also ensure regulatory parity. Over the past twenty years elimination of competitive barriers globally has led to increased cross-border and cross-sector competition. Hence in order to avoid disintermediation between sectors and between countries a unified approach will be required. Financial institutions in the three sectors are increasingly interrelated either as counter parties to a transaction or as a division within a conglomerate. Prudential logic suggests that the regulatory function should map onto the actual activities of the financial institutions themselves. Thi...|$|R
