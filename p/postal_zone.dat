2500|$|The {{development}} of postal codes reflects the increasing complexity of postal delivery as populations grew and {{the built environment}} became more complex. This happened first in large cities. Postal codes began with postal district numbers (or <b>postal</b> <b>zone</b> numbers) within large cities. London was first subdivided into 10 districts in 1857, and Liverpool in 1864. By World War I, such postal district or zone numbers existed in various large European cities. They existed in the United States at least {{as early as the}} 1920s, possibly implemented at the local post office level only (for example, instances of [...] "Boston 9, Mass" [...] in 1920 are attested,) although they were evidently not used throughout all major US cities (implemented USPOD-wide) until World War II.|$|E
