40|$|This work {{presents}} the laboratory testing results of kinetics the oxidation process and sample processing of the sulphide <b>polymetallic</b> <b>concentrate</b> Blagojev Kamen. The aim of investigation is recovery {{of these types}} of raw material, present in large quantities in the peripheral parts of already used primary mineral deposits of copper, because of their high economic potential due to the content {{of a large number of}} metals and especially precious metals. Characterization of this raw material is based on the chemical analyses, XRD results, DTA analysis, etc. For these investigations, the sulphide concentrate with the following content was used in %: Cu – 2. 3; Fe – 19. 8; S – 27. 19; Zn – 9. 13; As – 0. 167; Pb – 15. 63; SiO 2 – 17. 93; CaO – 0. 97; Al 2 O 3 – 1. 43; Ag – 480 g/t; Au – 659 g/t. Kinetic investigations of oxidation processes were carried out under the isothermal conditions within the temperature range of 400 to 625 oC. The Sharp's model was used for determination the kinetics parameters, and determined values of activation energy are 67 kJ/mole for the first period, and 47 kJ/mole for the second period. Pyrometallurgical treatment of this type of <b>polymetallic</b> <b>concentrate,</b> in the laboratory conditions, was carried out using the oxidative roasting and, then the reduction smelting was done in the Taman's furnace.

40|$|International audienceThe {{bioleaching}} of a concentrate {{produced from}} a black shale ore in an industrial operation in Poland was assessed. Following preliminary batch culture tests, processing in continuous conditions was tested to determine the main specifications {{for the application of}} the stirred-tank technology to this organic-rich <b>polymetallic</b> <b>concentrate.</b> The experimental work was carried out in a laboratory-scale unit consisting of three stirred tanks (50 L or 20 L) using an acidophilic and moderate thermophilic (42 °C) bacterial population. Different configurations of the unit and key operating parameters were tested (nutrient medium composition, solids concentration, agitation and aeration rates). The analysis of both bacterial community structure and mineralogical characteristics of the concentrate and the bioleach residues were implemented in order to better understand the chemical and biochemical reactions occurring in the system. Using the data produced during the continuous operation, downstream processing assessment for both copper and silver recovery was also carried out. The best copper recovery obtained in the continuous operation was 92 % and hot brine leaching of the bioleaching residue (PLINT Process) permitted the recovery of 92 % of the silver. Copper and silver recoveries seemed to be limited by incomplete chalcopyrite dissolution. A preliminary techno-economical evaluation of the concentrate bioleach processing, including bioleaching and copper and silver recoveries, demonstrated the potential economical feasibility. Silver recovery {{plays an important role in}} the process's finances. This study presents promising results that encourage further investigation of bioleach processing...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{focuses on}} the {{bioleaching}} of carrolite as pure mineral and application of bioleaching as an alternative technique for processing the polymetallic sulphide ores in Katanga copperbelt (case of Kamoya deposit ores) in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). A preliminary study on the bioleaching of carrolite {{in the presence of}} mesophilic bacteria has highlighted the effect of the initial pH (pH = 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5), particle size (- 53 μm, - 75 + 53 µm, - 106 + 75 µm), the pulp density (dp= 2. 5 and 10) on the pH, the solution redox and on the dissolution performance of copper, nickel and cobalt. The results obtained at this stage showed that the initial pH, particle size and pulp density greatly influences the process of bioleaching of carrolite. The evolution of pH, solution redox and the efficiency of metals dissolution with time considering these factors indicate the importance of bacterial growth. Good bacterial activity thereby yields high metal dissolution which is being obtained at initial pH 2. 0, particle size of - 53 μm and 2 % pulp density. A second study upon the bioleaching of carrolite has allowed highlighting the metal dissolution mechanism during the bioleaching process. The evolution of the bacterial population, observations of Optical Microscope (MO), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM) of carrolite grains during bioleaching and spectroscopical analysis in X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) of bioleaching residues allowed us to demonstrate the role and importance of bacteria attached on the surface of carrolite grains from one hand, and ferric ions on the other hand, during the carrolite bioleaching. Strong adhesion of bacteria {{to the surface of the}} carrolite grains was observed during early bioleach stages and playing an important role in the process. This phenomenon would cause the release of ferrous ions in solution by a direct contact mechanism on the one hand and causing oxidation of ferrous ions, elemental sulfur or sulfur compounds on the other hand, compounds which would accumulate at the surface of carrolite grains. The number of free bacteria in solution increases thus promoting the oxidation of ferrous to ferric ions, which oxidize the mineral through indirect mechanism. The number of free bacteria in solution and that of attached bacteria became constant over time, suggesting a cooperative mechanism of carrolite bioleaching. Finally, a statistical study of bioleaching of <b>polymetallic</b> <b>concentrate</b> from Kamoya deposit by Taguchi methodology and analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to investigate the effect of different physicochemical parameters (initial pH, temperature, agitation, pulp density and duration of bioleaching) on the process efficiency. The results obtained from this statistical approach showed the possibility of bioleaching application as an alternative technique for treatment of the polymetallic sulphide ores of the Katanga copperbelt in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) but further investigation using thermophilic bacteria should be considered to improve metal dissolution...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBioMinE is an {{integrated}} project under the sixth framework programme of research {{supported by the}} European Commission, which started in November 2004 and will last until October 2008 (Ref. NMP 2 -CT- 2005 - 500329). It {{is dedicated to the}} evaluation of biohydrometallurgy to improve the exploitation of the European non-ferrous metal resources in a sustainable way. At the end of 2007, the Consortium of BioMinE comprised 37 partners from industry (13 including 6 Small or Medium Enterprises), research organisations (8), universities (15), and government (1). The participants are from 13 EU member states and from Serbia and South Africa (INCO Countries). For more details see [URL] The three main kinds of resources considered for bioleaching studies are: * - Copper <b>polymetallics</b> (<b>concentrates</b> and tailings), * - Zinc polymetallics (zinc and zinc <b>polymetallic</b> <b>concentrates)</b> * - Secondary wastes (tailings, rock and metallurgical wastes, etc.) For each of these resources, amenability studies of application of bioleaching technologies by various approaches have been undertaken or still ongoing. Further processing assessment will be conducted up to the demonstration scale. Technological improvements have been made to apply bioleaching {{in the context of the}} European resources in terms of complexity and sustainability requirements. The relevant fundamental studies covering bio-prospecting, molecular ecology, biochemistry, and genetics areas aimed at improving the understanding and the control of the selected technologies have given original results. Much progress has also been obtained in the use of the microbial sulfate-reducing process to polish effluents and to recover metals from leachates containing low concentrations of metals. The finding of micro-organisms thriving at low and high temperature, respectively 8 and 65 °C, leads to an extension of the application range of the process. It has been also observed that this process could be pushed down to pH 4. 5 and 4 creating opportunities of selective metal recovery as metal sulphides. It has also been demonstrated that sulphate can be removed at high concentrations, as well as arsenic or selenium. The next step in this work is pilot testing. This will allow to determine scale-up criteria and to assess the residual metal concentration under actual conditions. The pilot-scale demonstration operations, as well as the techno-economic and comparative sustainability assessments will be achieved during 2008, the last year of the project. The prototypes of the learning objects for training about biohydrometallurgy accessible by internet have been elaborated. A public output of this work is accessible at [URL] The basic knowledge thus delivered is aimed at disseminating the understanding of the origins and use of biohydrometallurgy. Contacts with mining operators in Europe have been taken and collaboration schemes have been established in various ways according to the respective contexts. When a high potential of technical involvement could be foreseen, a direct participation of the mining operators in the project was favoured, this led to integrate KGHM (Pol), Boliden (Sw) and Copper Institute of Bor (Serbia) into the consortium of partners. When no direct technical commitment was conceivable at the first stage, collaboration was established with companies with the most urgent requirement to have access to the relevant resource...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} five parameters, temperature, pH, {{leaching}} duration, stirring speed and pulp density on the bioleaching of copper, cobalt and nickel from a <b>polymetallic</b> flotation <b>concentrate</b> were investigated. The leaching {{was carried out}} according to the L 25 (55) orthogonal design. The optimal values of the parameters were determined using a Taguchi method through signal-to-noise analysis. ANOVA was applied to verify the individual contribution of each parameter and their degree of significance. It was found out that pulp density was the most influential factor on the bioleaching yield of the three metals altogether, followed by pH and temperature. For the copper bioleach, the following optimal parameters were determined: temperature - 37. 5 °C, pH 1. 6, leaching duration - 20 days, stirring speed - 350 rpm and pulp density - 7. 5 %. Verification experiments conducted according to these optimal parameters brought copper yield of 72. 6 %.

40|$|Microorganisms were {{enumerated}} {{and isolated}} on selective solid media from a pilot-scale stirred-tank bioleaching operation {{in which a}} <b>polymetallic</b> sulfide <b>concentrate</b> was subjected to biologically accelerated oxidation at 45 °C. Four distinct prokaryotes were isolated: three bacteria (an Acidithiobacillus caldus-like organism, a thermophilic Leptospirillum sp., and a Sulfobacillus sp.) and one archaeon (a Ferroplasma-like isolate). The relative numbers of these prokaryotes changed in the three reactors sampled, and the Ferroplasma isolate became increasingly dominant as mineral oxidation progressed, eventually accounting for > 99 % of plate isolates in the third of three in-line reactors. The identities of the isolates were confirmed by analyses of their 16 S rRNA genes, and some key physiological traits (e. g., oxidation of iron and/or sulfur and autotrophy or heterotrophy) were examined. More detailed {{studies were carried out}} with the Leptospirillum and Ferroplasma isolates. The data presented here represent the first quantitative study of the microorganisms in a metal leaching situation and confirm that mixed cultures of iron- and sulfur-oxidizing prokaryotic acidophiles catalyze the accelerated dissolution of sulfidic minerals in industrial tank bioleaching operations. The results show that indigenous acidophilic microbial populations change as mineral dissolution becomes more extensive...|$|R
40|$|This review {{has as its}} {{underlying}} premise the need to become proficient in delivering a suite of element or metal products from polymetallic ores to avoid the predicted exhaustion of key metals in demand in technological societies. Many technologies, proven or still to be developed, will assist in meeting {{the demands of the}} next generation for trace and rare metals, potentially including the broader application of biohydrometallurgy for the extraction of multiple metals from low-grade and complex ores. Developed biotechnologies that could be applied are briefly reviewed and some of the difficulties to be overcome highlighted. Examples of the bioleaching of polymetallic mineral resources using different combinations of those technologies are described for <b>polymetallic</b> sulfide <b>concentrates,</b> low-grade sulfide and oxidised ores. Three areas for further research are: (i) the development of sophisticated continuous vat bioreactors with additional controls; (ii) in situ and in stope bioleaching and the need to solve problems associated with microbial activity in that scenario; and (iii) the exploitation of sulfur-oxidising microorganisms that, under specific anaerobic leaching conditions, reduce and solubilise refractory iron(III) or manganese(IV) compounds containing multiple elements. Finally, with the successful applications of stirred tank bioleaching to a polymetallic tailings dump and heap bioleaching to a polymetallic black schist ore, {{there is no reason why}} those proven technologies should not be more widely applied...|$|R
