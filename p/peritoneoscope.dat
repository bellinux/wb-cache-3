40|$|Peritoneoscopy is an {{invasive}} procedure. With {{attention to}} detail and a degree of dexterity which is inherent to surgery the procedure has been found safe in over 2, 500 cases. Peritoneoscopy must always be a sequel to careful clinical examination. The greatest advantage of peritoneoscopy over all other diagnostic modalities is that peritoneoscopic diagnosis is a final histological diagnosis and has no element of shadow, image or conjecture. Peritoneoscopy has its greatest value in the diagnosis of liver pathology, in ascites, jaundice, malignancy and tuberculosis especially if non-invasive scanning techniques are not available. When used with discretion, it has some value {{in the management of}} the acute abdomen. Surgeons will be gratified to find {{the extent to which the}} <b>peritoneoscope</b> can help arrive at an early histological diagnosis, plan surgery, reduce morbidity by avoiding unnecessary surgery and shorten hospitalisation...|$|E
40|$|Approximately 10 % of all peritoneal {{dialysis}} (PD) catheters are placed with direct visualization using a <b>peritoneoscope</b> (1). The procedure can be accom plished with most types of single or double-cuffed catheters. What is not appreciated {{is that the}} same technique is employable with the Swan neck permanent bend catheter. This information may be important as changes in catheter design evolve in an effort to decrease the incidence of PD catheter-associated complications (2). From September 1991 to February 1993, 43 of 44 PD catheters placed peritoneoscopic ally at the Ochsner Medical Institutions have been double-cuffed, Swan neck, curled catheters (Accurate Surgical Instruments, ON), with a uniform radiopaque stripe. The uniform stripe serves as a guide to maintain catheter orientation during placement and to avoid twisting the intramural segment of the catheter. Fourteen placements were accomplished in diabetics, one in an HIV-positive patient, and eight in patients who were obese. With 290 patient-months ' experience, complication rates have remained low: ten patients experienced catheter-related infections, and there was one leak. Four outflow/mechanical problems occurred that required catheter removal. All occurred in the early phases of the Ochsner peritoneoscopic placemen...|$|E
