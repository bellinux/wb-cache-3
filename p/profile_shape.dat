40|$|Recent {{experiments}} in the RTP tokamak {{have shown that the}} electron temperature, T-e, profile in EC heated L mode discharges can have {{only a small number of}} distinct <b>profile</b> <b>shapes,</b> depending on the location of the additional heating. The sharp transitions between the <b>profile</b> <b>shapes</b> are associated with the loss or gain of a low rational q surface. These observations suggest that the electron thermal diffusivity chi(e) is a direct function of the safety factor q, with alternating layers of low and high chi(e). It is shown that such a model not only excellently describes the distinct <b>profile</b> <b>shapes</b> but also predicts other, observed but so far unexplained, phenomena, such as sharp off-axis maxima of T-e observed with off-axis heating at specific radii...|$|R

50|$|Building {{envelope}} {{made from}} metal sheet provide builders and architects with products, which meet {{all of the}} highest demand regarding construction characteristics and design. The steel from which profiled cladding sheets are made is available pre-coated {{in a wide range}} of colors and textures, allowing architects to choose a finish that best suits the location and function of the building. <b>Profile</b> <b>shape</b> is also a characteristic that can be adapted to the demand of the architects.|$|E
50|$|After {{passing through}} the breaker plate molten plastic enters the die. The die is what gives the final product its profile and must be {{designed}} so that the molten plastic evenly flows from a cylindrical profile, to the product's <b>profile</b> <b>shape.</b> Uneven flow at this stage can produce a product with unwanted residual stresses at certain points in the profile which can cause warping upon cooling. Almost any shape imaginable can be created {{so long as it}} is a continuous profile.|$|E
50|$|Buildings are {{responsible}} of the 40% of European energy consumption, consequently, improving the thermal {{performance of the}} cladding and associated components is very important. The elemental U-value (thermal transmittance, W/m2K) of a cladding panel, depends on the conductivity and thickness of the insulation which is added, the <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> {{and the presence of}} thermal bridges. So, metal profile sheets can achieve thermal performance regulations thanks of insulations and profile shape.It is very important to analyze and avoid all possible thermal bridges within the roof and wall cladding assembly, to minimize local heat/cold losses.|$|E

50|$|A beam is a {{structural}} element that primarily resists loads applied laterally to the beam's axis. Its mode of deflection is primarily by bending. The loads {{applied to the}} beam result in reaction forces at the beam's support points. The total effect of all the forces acting on the beam is to produce shear forces and bending moments within the beam, that in turn induce internal stresses, strains and deflections of the beam. Beams are characterized by their manner of support, <b>profile</b> (<b>shape</b> of cross-section), length, and their material.|$|E
5000|$|The {{flexibility}} of the hose is achieved {{by means of the}} elastic behaviour of the corrugation profile. When the hose is bent, the outer corrugations separate while the inner corrugations are squeezed together. The flexibility, bending behaviour and pressure stability of corrugated hoses depend on the selected <b>profile</b> <b>shape.</b> While flexibility increases with an increase in profile height and a decrease in corrugation spacing, pressure resistance decreases. The frequently required semi-flexible bending behaviour is achieved by flat profiles. Depending {{on the use of the}} hose, special application-specific profile shapes can be implemented ...|$|E

50|$|Trapezoidal {{profiles}} and cassettes {{have been}} known in Europe for around 100 years. Today's popular characteristic <b>profile</b> <b>shape</b> came to Europe from the USA in the 50s and has steadily and noticeably gained in relevance since about 1960. At the present moment, the proportion of load bearing, room sealing trapezoidal profiles used in the overall area of all new and slightly sloping roofs amounts to 90%. Above all else the wide acceptance has resulted from the simple constructive training, the easy, fast assembly, the appealing formal style and last but not least, the economicalness of the trapezoidal profile construction.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{method for}} face {{recognition}} using profile images {{based on the}} representation of the original and morphological derived <b>profile</b> <b>shapes</b> is presented in this paper. The goal of our approach is to use information from profile outline that bounds the face and the hair. A grey-level profile image is thresholded to produce a binary image, representing the face region. After normalising the area and orientation of this shape using basic morphological operations, dilation and erosion, we simulate hair growth and haircut and produce two new profile silhouettes. From this three <b>profile</b> <b>shapes</b> feature vectors are obtained using distances between outline curve points and shape centroid. After normalising the vector components, the Euclidean distance measure is used for measuring the similarity of the feature vectors derived from different profiles. Experiments were performed on profile images of thirty persons. Experimental results including recognition rates are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{have carried}} out a {{comparative}} analysis of the properties of dark matter halos in N-body and hydrodynamical simulations. We analyze their density <b>profiles,</b> <b>shapes</b> and kinematical properties {{with the aim of}} assessing the effects that hydrodynamical processes might produce on the evolution of the dark matter component. The simulations performed allow us to reproduce dark matter halos with high resolution, although the range of circular velocities is limited. We find that for halos with circular velocities of $[150 - 200] km s^{- 1 }$ at the virial radius, the presence of baryons affects the evolution of the dark matter component in the central region modifying the density <b>profiles,</b> <b>shapes</b> and velocity dispersions. We also analyze the rotation velocity curves of disk-like structures and compare them with observational results. Comment: 28 pages, 15 figures (figures 3 ab sent by request), 2 tables.

Position of the shape wave excitation on a Josephson vortex acts like a “minute-hand” showing the time in the rest-frame associated with the vortex.

40|$|Identifying ozone <b>profile</b> <b>shapes</b> from nadir-viewing {{satellite}} sensors is {{a critical}} yet challenging task for accurate reconstruction of vertical distributions of ozone relevant to climate change and air quality. Motivated {{by the need to}} develop a methodology to fast, reliably, and efficiently exploit ozone distributions and inspired by the success of machine learning, this paper introduces a novel algorithm for estimating ozone <b>profile</b> <b>shapes</b> from satellite ultraviolet absorption spectra. The Full-Physics Inverse Learning Machine (FP-ILM) algorithm successfully characterizes ozone <b>profile</b> <b>shapes</b> using machine learning approaches. Its implementation mainly consists of a clustering process based on a semi-supervised agglomerative algorithm, a classification process based on full-physics radiative transfer simulations and a neural network (NN), and a profile scaling process based on a NN ensemble. The classification model has been trained with synthetic data generated by a forward model in conjunction with “smart sampling,” while the scaling model corresponding to each cluster requires total ozone information. The main innovation of FP-ILM is that, unlike conventional inversion methods, the ozone profile retrieval is formulated as a classification problem, leading to a noteworthy speed-up and accuracy when dealing with applications of satellite data. An outstanding retrieval performance with errors of less than 10 % over 100 – 1 hPa has been obtained for synthetic measurements. Furthermore, the ozone profiles retrieved from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment– 2 data using FP-ILM and the optimal estimation method reach an encouraging agreement (the differences are less than 6 Dobson Units or within 5 %– 20 %) ...|$|R
