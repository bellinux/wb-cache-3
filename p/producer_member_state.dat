50|$|Shortly {{after the}} conflict, media <b>producer</b> and <b>member</b> of <b>State</b> Duma, Konstantin Rykov, created a {{documentary}} called War 08.08.08. Art of Betrayal. He claims that Georgia was trained {{and led by}} the U.S. into war with South Osetia and Russia. The reason being that the US (then under George W. Bush) was interested in increasing presidential candidate John McCain's ratings, and demonizing Russia as an aggressor was key to it. The documentary had over a million views in first five days after being published online.|$|R
40|$|After {{four years}} of discussion, on 1 July 2012, the new European RoHS Directive 2011 / 65 /EU (RoHS 2. 0) was officially {{published}} and entered into force on 21 July 2012. Fraunhofer IZM together with Öko-Institute in Freiburg, Germany, has evaluated the RoHS exemptions and exemption requests for the European Commission since 2005 and is thus familiar with the regulations of the RoHS Directive. The recast RoHS overall brings considerable improvements for the producers of {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (EEE), but also new obligations and more stringent measures for compliance monitoring. This paper describes and explains the most important changes for producers. Producers benefit from new stipulations for exemptions and will be given more guidance for how to achieve RoHS compliance and how to apply for exemptions. But RoHS 2. 0 also extends its scope to almost all EEE and requires more efforts from <b>producers</b> and <b>member</b> <b>states</b> to prove and monitor RoHS-compliance...|$|R

The EU permits the use of [...] "enriched" [...] furnished cages that must meet certain space and amenity requirements. Egg <b>producers</b> in many <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have objected to the new quality standards while in some countries even furnished cages and family cages are subject to be banned as well. The production standard of the eggs is visible on the mandatory egg marking where the EU egg code begins with 3 for caged chicken to 1 for free-range eggs and 0 for organic egg production.|$|R
40|$|The European Commission {{has adopted}} a {{proposal}} to register Greek 'feta' cheese as a Protected Designation of Origin. This means that cheese designated as 'feta' must be produced in certain regions of Greece in ways respecting strict product specifications. <b>Producers</b> in other <b>member</b> <b>states</b> are given five years to {{change the name of}} their products or stop production. This follows nearly six years of dispute over the right of 'feta' cheese to be protected, which has gone {{all the way to the}} European Court of Justice. With other EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> having a production interest in 'feta' cheese it has proved difficult to secure a qualified majority for designation of 'feta' as a Protected Designation of Origin. Comment: The EU's long term objective is to secure WTO protection of such designations of origin. What the case of 'feta' cheese illustrates is that the scope of this system is likely to be substantially expanded over the coming years. In considering this issue ACP governments will need not only to look at the products currently falling under protected designation in which they have a production interest, but also products which could well be brought within an extended scheme. The European Commission {{has adopted a}} proposal to register Greek 'feta' cheese [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{changing}} {{internal and external}} conditions, the German arms industry is facing serious challenges as are its counterparts across Europe. The arms sales market in Germany is contracting – orders from the Bundeswehr are slowing down and the Federal Ministry of Defence is planning {{to change the way}} it cooperates with German arms <b>producers.</b> In addition, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> of NATO and the EU, major customers of German arms manufacturers, are reducing their defence spending, which will spell a fall in their orders for new armament and military equipment. In response to the new circumstances, the German arms industry is beginning to organise itself and increase its lobbying efforts in Berlin and, {{with the support of the}} federal government, it has been implementing specific measures in several areas. German companies are interested in securing new markets outside NATO and the EU and are also exploring opportunities for mergers and joint ventures with other German and foreign companies, and are seeking to create more conducive conditions for business on the EU and NATO markets...|$|R

40|$|In a new {{budgetary}} framework for years 2014 - 2020, {{changes will be}} made in expenditures of financial means from the EU budget, which will significantly influence incomes of agricultural <b>producers</b> in all <b>member</b> <b>states</b> of the Community. Incomes of agricultural enterprises always represented a very sensitive area of economic-political approaches in the agrarian sector. At the present, the situation is the same. In a theoretical sphere and in practice of institutions, ways to monitor incomes of agricultural farms, to analyze them, and what measures on base of these analyses to realize, are searched. The submitted paper deals in this context with a question of incomes according to their origin – agricultural incomes, incomes from non-agricultural activities, subsidy means. The aim is {{to draw attention to}} the fact that the subsidiary policy towards farmers can not be base in the area of incomes only on development and height of incomes, which have their origin in agricultural activities, but that it is necessary to consider the general income situation. A special attention has to be paid than to non-agricultural incomes – which are in the attention center in connection with demanding activity diversification.
