40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} a general {{methodology}} for system greybox identification. As is well-known, the tuning of accurate models of real plants (obtained, for instance, by using the physical knowledge of the plants and the technicians ’ expertise), {{on the basis of}} the measures provided by the available sensors, remains a challenge. In this paper, a tuning methodology for complex large-scale models, is presented. The proposed technique is based on the suitable use of neural networks and specific stochastic-approximation algorithms. It is therefore possible to design a simulator that can be connected in parallel with a real plant, thus providing the <b>plant</b> <b>technician</b> with information about inaccessible variables that are useful for supervision purposes. The proposed methodology is applied to a section of a real 320 MW power plant. Simulation results on the tuning algorithm show the effectiveness of the approach. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports on}} a case study {{examining}} the drinking water management system of one Territorial Local Authority (TLA) in the Waikato Region of New Zealand. This specific TLA was chosen because it took the leadership role as the first TLA {{in the region to}} strive for business excellence by providing the best water service to the community. That TLA chose the path of organisational change through adopting a Total Quality Management (TQM) Model i. e. ISO 9000 Certification as a means of building bridges between the two concepts. This case study shows how organisational excellence was integrated in the TLA’s strategy through their understanding of the core business process (i. e. service delivery to the community) and through involvement of the community. The research preceded by comparing theory and practice by analysis of three sets of data collected by two different techniques. The researcher conducted face to face interviews with the management team at the TLA. In addition, the researcher utilised participant observation techniques to document the actual practices of the regular working day of <b>plant</b> <b>technicians</b> at the water treatment plant of that respective TLA.

50|$|The {{story of}} The Soldier, the bearded {{convenience}} store owner {{from the previous}} game, shows him fighting a war against the Soviet Union in Hawaii alongside Jacket in 1985, prior to the first game's events. America appears to be losing this fictitious war, with cities and islands falling to the Soviet Red Army. The Soldier's elite Commando unit has been engaged in a campaign of deep penetration harassment against Russian fortifications and supply depots, however their increasingly detached and psychologically troubled Colonel appears to be losing his grip on reality as the war proceeds, volunteering them for increasingly desperate and dangerous missions while ruminating on their likely impending deaths {{and the loss of}} the war. Their last assignment involves besieging a heavily guarded Power Plant controlled by the Russians. As they make their way into the building, the Soviet commander in charge of it, having apparently gone insane, murders the <b>plant's</b> <b>technicians</b> and begins a meltdown on the main reactor before shooting himself in the head. The Soldier saves Jacket's life during their escape attempt, after a booby trap explodes and severely injures two members of their unit including Jacket, but later dies in 1986 during a nuclear strike on San Francisco which decisively terminates the war, revealing his appearances in the previous game to be Jacket's comatose hallucinations.|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} and experience accumulated in over a decade of advisory work by the GTZ Post-Harvest Project has now been collected and summarized in a new handbook, Manual on the prevention of post-harvest grain losses. This has been written to provide practical instruction and assistance to storekeepers, <b>plant</b> protection <b>technicians</b> agricultural extension and quarantine staff and all those who are concerned with store e problems in their daily work. Particular {{attention has been paid}} to the storage of cereals and legumes. Throughout the book, simple, low-cost facilities and storage methods have been described, appropriate to the requirements of developing countries. In recent decades significant changes have taken place as a result of increased crop yields, the cultivation of new varieties that are often more susceptible to attack by storage pests than traditional ones, and the spread of new pests. These changes have diminished the effectiveness of established storage systems and there is now a need to adapt traditional practices and develop new alternatives. This handbook provides a practical link between old and new ideas. The effects on stored produce of different climatic conditions such as temperature and relative humidity, are explained. Farm and village level storage containers and buildings are described and illustrated as well as the construction of larger, centralized storage and stacking systems. There are details of the fungi and insects which damage stored crops, together with methods of control by insecticides, fumigation and integrated pest management techniques. Particular attention is given throughout to the safety measures which must be taken when using chemicals. The manual ends by addressing the problems of dealing with larger pests, such as rats.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to define a simple (and easy to use) method to {{equalize}} the workload of personnel operating several small wastewater treatment plants (SWWTPs). The approach is illustrated through a case study which is the result of collaboration between researchers and a water and wastewater management company operating in Southern Italy. The topic is important since personnel {{have a significant impact on}} the operating costs of SWWTPs, and the approach outlined results in the minimum number of staff being required to assure the management of the service. Four kinds of work units are considered: plant managers, assistant <b>plant</b> managers, laboratory <b>technicians</b> and executives. In order to develop a practical, feasible and easy to use method, the workload was evaluated considering only the population equivalent (PE) and the number of plants managed. The core of the method is the evaluation of the percentage of time that the personnel units devote to the operation of SWWTPs of the municipality considered. The proposed procedure offers a useful tool to equalize the workload, both in terms of PE and the number of plants managed, the procedure being easily modifiable to introduce other evaluation criteria. By using familiar concepts such as PE and number of plants managed, the approach of the method can easily be understood by management.

Quantitative methods were employed. ^ Participants were assembly technicians who successfully completed the ATP. Completion scores from the ATP final test were compared with supervisor factor ratings of quality, job knowledge, and safety on the first two performance evaluations. The management perception at Allen Manufacturing was that higher ATP test scores by assembly technicians corresponded to higher performance evaluations. ^ A questionnaire was developed using both open and closed form type responses. The responses for closed form questions were demographic and Likert scale responses to specific questions. Open form questions allowed the respondents to express their thoughts concerning the most and least effective parts of the ATP and to make suggestions to improve the training process. ^ Graduates of diesel engine vocational school, who have prior experience, and score highly on the ATP summative test might be expected to receive higher performance evaluations than their peers. However, high scores on the ATP summative test were related to receiving higher performance evaluation ratings on job knowledge to a greater extent than the factors of prior experience or completion of diesel engine vocational school. Therefore, the perception by Allen Manufacturing Management that higher ATP test scores corresponded to higher performance evaluations appeared to be supported by the results of this study. ...|$|R

The primary objective of this research study was to find out the key problematic issues of mould designing and manufacturing for plastic based industry in Sri Lanka and to develop a mechanism to address identified issues. A questionnaire based survey method was used for the research study. The questionnaire was structured in order to investigate and rank critical problematic issues faced by die and mould manufactures for plastic based industry in Sri, Lanka. Further, there were several rounds of semi-structured interviews with managers, <b>plant</b> engineers and <b>technicians</b> involved in mould design and manufacture for gathering relevant information.
