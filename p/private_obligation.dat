Besides, a collective debt defrayed by taxes has, over the same debt parceled out among individuals, the immense advantage that it is virtually a mutual insurance among the contributors. If the fortune of a contributor diminishes, his taxes diminish; if he is ruined, they cease altogether, and his portion of the debt is wholly transferred to the solvent members of the community. If it were laid on him as a <b>private</b> <b>obligation,</b> he would still be liable to it, even when penniless.|$|E

Till that change takes place, we will treat with scorn the senseless outcry for the recovery of an independence which has never been lost. We are, have been, and will remain, independent; and the host of men, respectable on every account, who have publicly avowed their desire to maintain our present Representatives in their seats, deem it insolence to assert the contrary. They are independent in every rational sense of the word; acknowledging, however, that they rest upon a principle, and are incorporated with an interest; and this they regard as a proof that their affections are sane, and their understandings superior to illusion. But in certain vocabularies liberty is synonymous with licence; and to be free, as explained by some, is to live and act without restraint. In like manner, independence, according {{to the meaning of}} their interpretation, is the explosive energy of conceit--making blind havoc with expediency. It is a presumptuous spirit at war with all the passive worth of mankind. The independence which they boast of despises habit, and time-honoured forms of subordination; it consists in breaking old ties upon new temptations; in casting off the modest garb of <b>private</b> <b>obligation</b> to strut about in the glittering armour of public virtue; in sacrificing, with jacobinical infatuation, the near to the remote, and preferring, to what has been known and tried, that which has no distinct existence, even in imagination; in renouncing, with voluble tongue and vain heart, every thing intricate in motive, and mixed in quality, in a downright passion of love for absolute, unapproachable patriotism! In short, the independence these Reformers bawl for is the worthy precursor of the liberty they adore;--making her first essay by starting out of the course for the pleasure of falling into the ditch; and asserting her heaven-born vigour by soaring above the level of humanity in profession, that it may more conspicuously appear how far she can fall below it in practice.|$|E

30|$|The {{internal}} outcomes perceived {{autonomy and}} organizational commitment are also positively affected by FWPs whereby FWPs {{have a negative}} relationship with turnover intention. FWPs improve the perceived autonomy of existing employees and their attachment to their organizations, both when measuring organizational attachment as organizational commitment and as (an absence of) turnover intention. All effects are statistically significant except for the marginally insignificant effect of telecommuting on organizational commitment. The latter effect {{can be explained by}} the positive and negative aspects of telecommuting that may neutralize each other. On the one hand, telecommuting blurs the boundary between work and private life (Hill et al. 2003; Igbaria and Guimaraes 1999) and, thus, leads to a greater integration of work and non-work roles (Rau and Hyland 2002). As a consequence, telecommuting may lead to prolonged workdays and increased demand of extensive availability (Heijstra and Rafnsdottir 2010). Moreover, employees often fear to be isolated when using telecommuting (Kurland and Cooper 2002; Golden and Veiga 2008). On the other hand, telecommuting increases the perceived autonomy of employees (Gajendran and Harrison 2007), helps in coordinating work and <b>private</b> <b>obligations</b> (Duxbury et al. 1998; Harpaz 2002) and reduces commuting time (Raghuram and Wiesenfeld 2004).|$|R

As {{the play was}} written in the Restoration period, when the legal protections for women were few, the {{emotional}} heart of the play is the vulnerability of women. Aquillina, the play's courtesan, is shown very little regard by the men in the play. Her lover, Pierre, refuses to reveal the plot against the Senate to her, suggesting that women shouldn't talk out of bed, and Antonio never calls her by her name, but refers to her only as his [...] "little Nacky" [...] (a slang term for a woman's genitalia). Belvidera is reduced to collateral when she is left in the hands of men her husband barely knows. Jaffeir's honour takes precedence over Belvidera, and the tension over love and honour is the male characters' crisis. At the end of the play, Jaffeir chooses his devotion to his friend over his devotion to his wife, and the two men die honourably, whereas Belvidera is left to die an inglorious death resulting from her madness.

Instead, it should give rise to a presumption of untimeliness that may be overcome based on considerations consistent with the legitimate policies that underlie statutes of limitations.

The second issue was seeking the optimal degree of restriction of contractual freedom in labour law relationships de lege lata as the basis for proposals de lege ferenda. The result of this (second) process - the content of the decision on the appropriate degree of peremptory regulation of relationships - has at the same time become a criterion for the evaluation of the statutory text.

40|$|Toward Perpetual Peace is Immanuel Kant's {{treatise}} on international peace. The argumentative {{strategy of the}} text is aimed at increasing the likelihood of peace by reducing the risk sovereign nations face when attempting to trust one another. As part of the risk reduction strategy Kant prohibits nations from keeping secrets. Secrets erode trust and thus jeopardize the movement toward perpetual peace. Having established this, Kant issues the Secret Article for Perpetual Peace which allows the sovereign {{to benefit from the}} counsel of an educated citizenry without acknowledging their influence and, in effect, he receives counsel in secret. Kant acknowledges the contradiction yet defends it, claiming that public consultation is damaging to the sovereign's dignity and thus must be conducted in secret. [...] Although the dignity defense is ultimately a self-refuting and, therefore, inadequate grounds for the secret article, this thesis argues that the article can be understood as being commensurate with Kant's project of enlightenment. I resolve the contradiction by reading the article in the context of What is Enlightenment?.

This paper aims at {{providing}} {{quantitative and}} qualitative evidence of a crowding out effect due to war borrowing {{at the end of}} eighteenth-century Spain. In the second section, I examine the two key links in the crowding out argument. First, did the Spanish government's issuance of debt to finance warfare result in higher real interest rates? Second, did it cause a reduction of private investment? Annual data for long-term interest rates and for government borrowing allow examination of the first link in the crowding out argument. Then, using original annual data on the volume of long-term private credit that we collected from the mortgage registry of Madrid (Contaduría de Hipotecas de Madrid), we examine the second link of the argument. In the third section, this paper analyses structural changes in the long-term private capital market. We argue that the dramatic increase in public borrowing {{at the end of the}} eighteenth century to finance warfare crowded out ecclesiastical institutions and shut down large part of the private credit market for long-term annuities for the decades to come.

As originally sent to the states, section 1 - 301 would have allowed non-consumer parties to a contract to select a governing law that bore no relation to their transaction. Proponents justifiably contended that such autonomy was consistent with emerging international norms and {{with the nature of}} contracts creating voluntary <b>private</b> <b>obligations.</b> Despite such arguments, the original version of section 1 - 301 was resoundingly rejected, gaining zero adoptions by the states before its withdrawal in 2008. This Article contends that this political failure within the simultaneous overall success of Revised Article 1 was due in significant part to proposed section 1 - 301 invoking a negative visceral reaction from its American audience. This reaction occurred not because of state or national parochialism, but because the concept of unbounded choice of law violated cultural symbols and myths about the nature of law. The American social and legal culture aspires to the ideal that “no one is above the law” and the related ideal of maintaining “a government of laws, and not of men. ” Proposed section 1 - 301 transgressed those ideals by taking something labeled as “law” and turning on its head the expected norm of general applicability. Future proponents of law reform arising from internationalization would do well to consider the role of symbolic ideals in their targeted jurisdictions. While proposed section 1 - 301 made much practical sense, it failed in part because it did not—to an American audience—make sense in theory...|$|R
