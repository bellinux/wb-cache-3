5|$|P.fluviatile {{has been}} {{harvested}} for food since classical antiquity, {{and is now}} threatened by overexploitation. Many of the island populations are <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable,</b> and the Maltese subspecies has become a conservation icon. A population in Rome may have been brought there before {{the founding of the}} Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to longitudinal studies, {{there has been}} psychophysiological research on the biology of attachment. Research has begun to include neural development, behaviour genetics and temperament concepts. Generally, temperament and attachment constitute separate developmental domains, but aspects of both contribute {{to a range of}} interpersonal and intrapersonal developmental outcomes. Some types of temperament may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that some children are <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to developing attachment disorders.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} {{predation}} by invasive mammalian species including ship rats, cats, and mustelids was an additional {{factor in the}} decline in huia numbers – introduction of these animals by New Zealand acclimatisation societies peaked in the 1880s and coincided with a particularly sharp decline in huia populations. Because it {{spent a lot of}} time on the ground, the huia would have been <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to mammalian predators. Another hypothetical cause of extinction is exotic parasites and disease introduced from Asia with the common myna.|$|E

50|$|Natural hazards such as earthquakes, floods, volcanoes and tsunami have {{threatened}} people, society, the natural environment, and the built environment, <b>particularly</b> more <b>vulnerable</b> people, throughout history, {{and in some}} cases, on a day-to-day basis. According to the Red Cross, each year 130,000 people are killed, 90,000 are injured and 140 million are affected by unique events known as natural disasters.|$|R
5|$|Like mayflies, {{stoneflies}} and dragonflies, but to {{a somewhat}} lesser extent, caddisflies are an indicator of good water quality; they die out of streams with polluted waters. They {{are an important part}} of the food web, both larvae and adults being eaten by many fish. The newly hatched adult is <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable</b> as it struggles to the surface after emerging from the submerged pupa, and as it dries its wings. The fish find these new adults easy pickings, and fishing flies resembling them can be successful for anglers at the right time of year.|$|E
5|$|The {{drive to}} capture wildlife, and {{particularly}} slow lorises, is increasingly dominated by demands from wealthy urban areas, replacing the subsistence hunting traditionally performed in poor rural areas. In {{the case of}} long-lived primates, such as the slow lorises, populations replenish themselves slowly. Slow lorises are <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable</b> {{because they tend to}} freeze when spotted. Lastly, increased access to new technologies, such as improved transport, guns, wire snares, and spotlights, have facilitated hunting and pushed extraction levels beyond the point of sustainability. These new factors threaten slow loris survival.|$|E
5|$|The {{natural range}} of Potamon fluviatile is highly fragmented, and covers parts of many {{countries}} with a Mediterranean coastline. It {{is found in}} mainland Italy and on the Balkan Peninsula from Dalmatia to the Axios River in Greece. It is also found {{on a number of}} islands, including Sicily, Malta and Gozo, the Ionian Islands, Aegean Islands, Sporades and Andros in the Cyclades. Although the species as a whole is widespread, it is declining in numbers, and these insular populations are <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable.</b>|$|E
30|$|It is {{important}} to state that this expansion in childcare did not <b>particularly</b> benefit <b>vulnerable</b> groups, such as low-educated mothers, single mothers or large families. This is likely due to {{the high cost of}} institutional childcare in Switzerland. To better test this assumption, a cost-benefit approach should be performed through a labour supply model (as in Müller and Wrohlich 2015), and further research is needed in this regard.|$|R

50|$|The Legal Response Initiative {{provides}} free legal {{support to}} poor and <b>particularly</b> climate <b>vulnerable</b> developing countries, {{and civil society}} observer organisations, at international negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It operates through a network of lawyers from law firms, barrister chambers and universities in different jurisdictions who give hands-on assistance during meetings, draft legal opinions or build the capacity of lawyers and negotiators from developing countries.|$|R
5|$|When an {{aircraft}} carrier deploys, it takes a Strike Group, made up of several other warships and supply vessels which allow the operation to be carried out. The armament of the Nimitz class is made up only of short range defensive weapons, used as a {{last line of defense}} against enemy missiles and aircraft. An aircraft carrier, as with all surface ships, is <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to attack from below, specifically from submarines. An aircraft carrier is a very expensive, hard to replace and strategically valuable asset and therefore logically has a huge target value.|$|E
5|$|Women and men {{differ in}} their {{chromosomal}} makeup, protein gene products, genomic imprinting, gene expression, signaling pathways, and hormonal environment. All of these necessitate caution in extrapolating information derived from biomarkers from one sex to the other. Women are <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable</b> at the two extremes of life. Young women and adolescents are at risk from STIs, pregnancy and unsafe abortion, while older women often have few resources and are disadvantaged with respect to men, and also {{are at risk of}} dementia and abuse, and generally poor health.|$|E
5|$|Also in October 2012, Jamie McIntosh of IJM Canada {{said that}} his {{organization}} supports the NAP-CHT, and that the plan's promises to participate in international child protection would be best fulfilled by apprehending and prosecuting Canadians who engage in child sex tourism and child trafficking in other countries. McIntosh recommended that this work be focused on Cambodia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, the Philippines, and Thailand because these countries are <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to Canadian traffickers. He also recommended focusing on these countries because Canadians have been caught participating in child sex tourism there; McIntosh made specific reference to the cases of Kenneth Klassen and Donald Bakker.|$|E

50|$|In April 2002, an {{inspection}} report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons condemned conditions for inmates at Swansea Prison. The report {{called on the}} prison to improve cleanliness and sanitation, <b>particularly</b> for <b>vulnerable</b> inmates who are housed away from other prisoners. The report also highlighted the lack of showers in all areas, which meant that not all inmates were able to shower every day. However the prison was praised for its rehabilitation of inmates.|$|R
5|$|Although the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} {{has affected}} men, women, {{and children in}} Malawi, certain factors such as sexual orientation, gender, and age influence infection patterns. In Malawi, HIV/AIDS is usually transmitted through heterosexual sex, but the epidemic has also significantly impacted the homosexual male population in Malawi. In addition, women in Malawi {{are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men, suggesting that women are <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to HIV/AIDS. Finally, the disease has affected children and young adults both directly and indirectly; 170,000 Malawian children were HIV-positive in 2011, and the number of orphans in Malawi has increased dramatically since the epidemic began in 1985.|$|E
5|$|Being low-lying {{and largely}} {{surrounded}} by water, Norfolk is <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to rising sea levels. In addition, the {{land on which}} it is built is slowly subsiding. Some areas already flood regularly at high tide, and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to investigate how {{to address the issue}} in the future: it reported the cost of dealing with a sea-level rise of one foot would be around $1,000,000,000. Since then, scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 2013 have estimated that if current trends hold, the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 and 1/2 feet or more {{by the end of this}} century.|$|E
5|$|The deadliest {{storm surge}} on record was the 1970 Bhola cyclone, which killed up to 500,000 {{people in the}} area of the Bay of Bengal. The low-lying coast of the Bay of Bengal is <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to surges caused by {{tropical}} cyclones. The deadliest storm surge in the twenty-first century was caused by the Cyclone Nargis, which killed more than 138,000 people in Myanmar in May 2008. The next deadliest in this century was caused by the Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda), which killed more than 6,000 people in the central Philippines in 2013 and resulted in economic losses estimated at $14 billion (USD).|$|E

5|$|Ambulances, {{like other}} {{emergency}} vehicles, {{are required to}} operate in all weather conditions, including those during which civilian drivers often elect {{to stay off the}} road. Also, the ambulance crew's responsibilities to their patient often preclude their use of safety devices such as seat belts. Research has shown that ambulances {{are more likely to be}} involved in motor vehicle collisions resulting in injury or death than either fire trucks or police cars. Unrestrained occupants, particularly those riding in the patient-care compartment, are <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable.</b> When compared to civilian vehicles of similar size, one study found that on a per-accident basis, ambulance collisions tend to involve more people, and result in more injuries. An 11-year retrospective study concluded in 2001 found that although most fatal ambulance crashes occurred during emergency runs, they typically occurred on improved, straight, dry roads, during clear weather. Furthermore, paramedics are also at risk in ambulances while helping patients, as 27 paramedics died during ambulance trips in the US between 1991 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|At this time, private loyalty-review {{boards and}} anti-communist {{investigators}} {{began to appear}} to fill a growing demand among certain industries to certify that their employees were above reproach. Companies that {{were concerned about the}} sensitivity of their business, or who, like the entertainment industry, felt <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to public opinion made use of these private services. For a fee, these teams would investigate employees and question them about their politics and affiliations. At such hearings, the subject would usually not have a right to the presence of an attorney, and as with HUAC, the interviewee might be asked to defend himself against accusations without being allowed to cross-examine the accuser. These agencies would keep cross-referenced lists of leftist organizations, publications, rallies, charities and the like, as well as lists of individuals who were known or suspected communists. Books such as Red Channels and newsletters such as Counterattack and Confidential Information were published to keep track of communist and leftist organizations and individuals. Insofar as the various blacklists of McCarthyism were actual physical lists, they were created and maintained by these private organizations.|$|E
5|$|During a {{time when}} they are both <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable,</b> Dimitri and Edmund's wife, Maria, sleep together. When Maria finds out she is pregnant, they have a DNA test done. Skye Chandler, who is in love with Edmund, tampers with test so it will show Dimitri is the father when it is in fact Edmund. After Maria confesses everything, a devastated Edmund tells Dimitri that he is dead to him and he will be {{bringing}} the child up as his own. Maria gives birth to a baby girl named Maddie and is later presumed dead in a plane crash. Dimitri discovers that Edmund is Maddie's father when he finds out their blood types do not match. He takes her to Vadzel, but Edmund tracks them down and takes back custody of Maddie. The brothers remain estranged for quite some time, but eventually manage to reconcile. Dimitri leaves Pine Valley permanently in 2001 with his current wife, Alex Devane.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{released}} {{the results of}} a five-year-long study (the Highway Serial Killings Initiative) investigating the unsolved murders of prostitutes, hitchhikers, and stranded motorists. Over 500 female victims have been compiled in a database, most of whom were killed or discarded at truck stops, hotels, and roadsides. The FBI has speculated that many of these victims were murdered by long-haul truck drivers, some of whom may be serial killers. Investigators speculate that the easy access to potential victims, mobility, and lack of supervision enjoyed by long-haul truck drivers have contributed to this phenomenon. The head of the initiative, Michael Harrigan, says most of the victims lead high-risk lifestyles (e.g., prostitution) which left them <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable.</b> In 2004, the FBI began investigating a string of murders in which the victims were found along the Interstate 40 corridor in Oklahoma and several other states, which sparked the creation of the Highway Serial Killings Initiative.|$|E
5|$|Like the extinctions {{of other}} New Zealand birds {{such as the}} piopio in the 19th century, {{the decline of the}} huia was poorly studied. Massive {{deforestation}} occurred in the North Island at this time, particularly in the lowlands of southern Hawkes Bay, the Manawatu and the Wairarapa, as land was cleared by European settlers for agriculture. The huia was <b>particularly</b> <b>vulnerable</b> to this as it could only live in old-growth forest where there were abundant rotting trees filled with wood-boring insect larvae. It seems it could not survive in regenerating, secondary forests. Although the mountainous part of its former range was not deforested, the lowland forests of the valleys below were systematically destroyed. The destruction of this part of its habitat would have undoubtedly had a severe impact on huia populations, but its removal would have been particularly dire if they did in fact descend to the lowlands as a winter refuge to escape snow at higher altitudes as some researchers including Oliver have surmised.|$|E
