25|$|Some {{forms of}} sexual violence, such as gang rape, are {{predominantly}} committed by young men. Sexual aggression {{is often a}} defining characteristic of manhood in the group and is {{significantly related to the}} wish to be held in high esteem. Sexually aggressive behavior among young men has been linked with gang membership and having delinquent peers. Research also suggests that men with sexually aggressive <b>peers</b> <b>are</b> also much more likely to report coercive or enforced intercourse outside the gang context than men lacking sexually aggressive peers. Gang rape is often viewed by the men involved, and sometimes by others too, as legitimate, in that it is seen to discourage or punish perceived immoral behavior among women, such as wearing short skirts or frequenting bars.|$|E

500|$|The {{privilege}} of freedom from arrest applies {{to members of}} both Houses of Parliament, because of the principle that they must, whenever possible, be available to give advice to the Sovereign. Several other nations have copied this provision; the Constitution of the United States, for example, provides, [...] "The Senators and Representatives... shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses." [...] Theoretically, even when Parliament is not sitting, peers enjoy the privilege because they continue to serve the Sovereign as counsellors.

Paraprofessional <b>peers</b> <b>are</b> defined as having a shared background as the target population and work closely with and supplement the services of the mental healthcare team.

The peer support for recovery model focuses on improvement in overall health and wellness, and has long been successful in the treatment of SMI (serious mental illness) but is relatively new for PTSD.|$|E
