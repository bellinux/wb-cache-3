40|$|A {{simulation}} model for an automatic gearbox with <b>primary</b> <b>retarder</b> has been constructed and implemented, in this thesis. Together with other modelled vehicle components, this model could for example {{be used for}} fuel consumption estimation or optimizing vehicle parameters. The mechanical components and the control system inside the automatic gearbox were modelled separately and then assembled into the final gearbox model, using the object-oriented programming language Modelica. Modelica ensures that each individual component can be reused in other models. The gearbox model was validated {{through a number of}} test cycles designed to capture different vehicle behaviours. The test cycles were recreated in the simulation environment and the simulation results could be compared to a real vehicle performing the same tests. Validation showed that the model succeeded in its goal, that the implemented model is reproducing similar behaviour as the real gearbox. With gear shifts taking place in about the same situations and converter locking/unlocking occurring the same time in the simu-lations as in the real vehicle testing...|$|E
40|$|The <b>primary</b> {{function}} of <b>retarders</b> in cement slurry design {{is to increase}} the thickening time at higher temperature to allow time for placement of the liquid slurry. This has been the focus in the oil Industry on cement slurry design using retarders. However, test results from this research work using different retarder concentrations indicated that not only the thickening time was affected but the compressive strength, rheological as well as the free fluid properties. Increasing retarder concentration not only resulted to increase in thickening time, but a decrease in both rheological properties and early strength development as well as increase in free fluid results. It is therefore imperative that to optimize a cement slurry design to meet up with design objectives and all boundary conditions, the choice of optimum retarder concentration is critical...|$|R
