Two sheep and two goat flocks were used to verify the DrenchRite['rM] larval development assay with results obtained from fecal egg reduction tests (FERT). The two flocks of each species differed in environmental exposure to gastrointestinal nematodes. The flocks were divided into three or four treatment groups: one control (not treated), a benzimidazole-treated group, a levamisole-treated group, and an ivermectin-treated group. Fecal egg reduction tests were performed with each group and correlations between the reduction percentages and the efficacy values obtained from the DrenchRite['rM] manual were used to verify the assay plate. DrenchRite[TM] indicated high resistance to the benzimidazoles {{in each of the four}} flocks. This was in agreement with the FERT data, except for <b>Sheep</b> <b>Flock</b> 2 which was moderately resistant. Data from DrenchRite[TM] pertaining to levamisole showed susceptibility for <b>Sheep</b> <b>Flock</b> 1, moderate resistance for <b>Sheep</b> <b>Flock</b> 2, susceptibility for Goat Flock 1, and moderate resistance for Goat Flock 2. The FERT data relative to levamisole showed high resistance for <b>Sheep</b> <b>Flock</b> 1, susceptibility for <b>Sheep</b> <b>Flock</b> 2, high resistance for Goat Flock l, and susceptibility for Goat Flock 2. No benzimidazole/levamisole combination was tested in the four flocks so no comparison was made to the DrenchRite[TM] data. DrenchRite['rM] results for the averments showed susceptibility for <b>Sheep</b> <b>Flock</b> 1, <b>Sheep</b> <b>Flock</b> 2, and Goat Flock 2.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the sheep breeds, traditional sheep breeding practices and flock structure in four selected representative rural kebeles in Burie district North Western Ethiopia. Informal and formal surveys in the selected kebeles were conducted. The farmers interviewed were selected by using random sampling method. In addition, <b>sheep</b> <b>flocks</b> within the selected kebeles were selected and body weight (BW) using hanging scale, sex and age (estimated based on dentition) of the animals were measured and recorded. There were two sheep breeds in the study area, Washera and Horro. The proportion of the sheep breeds in the <b>sheep</b> <b>flocks</b> among the study kebeles was different. There were more Washera sheep (98 %) in Woheni Durebetie kebele and more Horro sheep (92 %) in Boko Tabo kebele. On average, one farmer had 3. 7 ± 2. 46 heads of sheep per household (n = 127). The mean body weight of sheep in the <b>sheep</b> <b>flocks</b> was 21. 6 ± 9. 34 kg (n = 1211). The proportion of male and female sheep in the <b>sheep</b> <b>flocks</b> was 30. 5 % and 69. 5 %, respectively. Farmers in the study area practice crossbreeding Washera with Horro breed. There is a possibility of inbreeding in the <b>sheep</b> <b>flocks.</b> In addition, more productive male animals are being sold, slaughtered or castrated at a young age, so, there is a chance to reduce the population of such animals in future generations.

During 2007 it became evident that BTV- 8 {{had survived the}} winter and a re-emerging epidemic quickly developed. The objective {{of this study was}} to describe the severity and clinical impact of the BTV- 8 epidemic in 2007 in The Netherlands in laboratory-confirmed outbreaks and to compare this with the situation in 2006. The relative frequency of clinical signs in BTV- 8 affected <b>sheep</b> <b>flocks</b> and cattle herds in 2007 and 2006 was similar.

3000|$|All sheep breeds {{under study}} were {{subjected}} to extensive management system {{with little or no}} supplementary feeding. The animals grazed during the day on crop stubbles and low grade forage on barren land and roadsides for 6 – 8 hours and walked a distance of about 5 – 20 kilometres. They were taken to water source {{two or three times a}} day. During lean period, only Mandya sheep were given supplementary feed like jowar (sorghum), wheat (Triticum), ragi (Eleusine coracana), horse gram (Macrotyloma uniflorum) husk, and leaves of acacia, peepal (Ficus religiosa) and neem (Azadirachta indica). Stall feeding of small flocks was a routine practice carried by Mandya sheep rearers but Bellay sheep rearers provided supplementary feeding to the breeding rams during breeding season only. Mandya and Kenguri <b>sheep</b> <b>flocks</b> were stationary. Most of the Hassan <b>sheep</b> <b>flocks</b> were stationary but some flocks migrated to the adjoining areas during the lean periods of March to June. Bellary sheep migrate to the southern parts of the state (up to 150 – 300 kilometres) during December-August. Some of the Kenguri sheep farmers introduced Bellary rams in their flocks, and admixtures of the two sheep breeds were observed. Adequate health care was provided. Animals were vaccinated against haemorrhagic septicaemia, enterotoxaemia and sheep pox. Anthelmintics were used against the endoparasites. Adult mortality in the four breeds ranged from 5 – 15 %. Flock size of the four breeds varied from small to large. Majority of the Bellary <b>sheep</b> <b>flocks</b> were large to medium sized having average flock size 143 (5 adult males, 106 adult females and 32 young). Most of the Kenguri <b>sheep</b> <b>flocks</b> were medium sized comprising average flock size 87 (4 adult males, 60 adult females and 23 young). Hassan <b>sheep</b> <b>flocks</b> were medium sized consisting average flock size 34 (3 adult males, 23 adult females and 8 young).

40|$|A {{national}} survey of Escherichia coli O 26 in Norwegian <b>sheep</b> <b>flocks</b> was conducted, using fecal samples to determine the prevalence. In total, 491 flocks were tested, and E. coli O 26 was detected in 17. 9 % of the flocks. One hundred forty-two E. coli O 26 isolates were examined for flagellar antigens (H typing) and four virulence genes, including stx and eae, to identify possible Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). Most isolates (129 out of 142) were identified as E. coli O 26 :H 11. They possessed eae and may have potential as human pathogens, although {{only a small fraction}} were identified as STEC O 26 :H 11, giving a prevalence in <b>sheep</b> <b>flocks</b> of only 0. 8 %. Correspondingly, the <b>sheep</b> <b>flock</b> prevalence of atypical EPEC (aEPEC) O 26 :H 11 was surprisingly high (15. 9 %). The genetic relationship between the E. coli O 26 :H 11 isolates was investigated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), identifying 63 distinct PFGE profiles and 22 MLVA profiles. Although the MLVA protocol was less discriminatory than PFGE and a few cases of disagreement were observed, comparison by partition mapping showed an overall good accordance between the two methods. A close relationship between a few isolates of aEPEC O 26 :H 11 and STEC O 26 :H 11 was identified, but all the E. coli O 26 :H 11 isolates should be considered potentially pathogenic to humans. The present study consisted of a representative sampling of <b>sheep</b> <b>flocks</b> from all parts of Norway.

Since then, however, several <b>sheep</b> <b>flocks</b> were infected and suffered massive fetal losses suggesting a re-emergence of the disease. Therefore, {{the aim of}} this study was to assess the epidemiological situation of S. Abortusovis infection in sheep in this country. A representative serum sample collected in 2007 in the context of certifying Brucella freedom included sera from 578 flocks with a total of 8426 sheep from all regions in Switzerland and the Principality of Liechtenstein. Sera were tested by ELISA for the presence of antibodies specific for S. Abortusovis. The cantonal seroprevalence was estimated at the sheep as well as the flock-level by taking into account (a) all flocks with one or more seropositive <b>sheep</b> (<b>Flock</b> 1 +) and (b) only the flocks with two or more seropositive <b>sheep</b> (<b>Flock</b> 2 +). <b>Flocks</b> with seropositive <b>sheep</b> were found throughout the country with an overall sheep-level prevalence of 1. 7 %.

Sheep (n[*]=[*] 28) and goat (n[*]=[*] 28) flocks from three areas of Norway were randomly selected to assess the prevalence of anthelmintic resistance (AR), whereas only lambs from non-randomly selected <b>sheep</b> <b>flocks</b> (n[*]=[*] 32) with a farm management that could select for AR were investigated the second year. Only flocks with a mean excretion of nematode eggs per gram feces (EPG) ≥ 150 at time of treatment were included in the survey. In total, 48 (80 %) and 13 (46. 4 %) of the selected <b>sheep</b> and goat <b>flocks,</b> respectively, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The proportions of flocks classified as resistant (i. e., FECR < 95 % and with a lower 95 % confidence interval of < 90 %) for the BZ drug albendazole were 10. 5 % and 31. 0 % in the randomly and non-randomly selected <b>sheep</b> <b>flocks,</b> respectively.
