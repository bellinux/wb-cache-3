30|$|Two novel {{isolates}} {{were identified}} for {{the degradation of}} cyclo(dl-Ala-dl-Ala). These strains were classified as Paenibacillus sp. 32 A (DSM 27214) and Microbacterium sp. 40 A (DSM 27211) by 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis and alignment. The enantioselectivity towards this racemic substrate was investigated for both strains: the enantiomers cyclo(l-Ala-l-Ala) and cyclo(l-Ala-d-Ala) were completely degraded, whereas no cleavage of cyclo(d-Ala-d-Ala) was detected. Thus, enantioselectivity towards substrates containing at least one l-Ala was identified. Enantioselective DKP hydrolysis was studied by Kanzaki et al. (1997, 2000) for Arthrobacter sp. 1 - 3 - 1, <b>coryneform</b> <b>rod</b> bacterium T- 1 - 3 -Y and Agrobacterium radiobacter NM 5 - 3 : Arthrobacte r sp. 1 - 3 - 1 preferred cyclo(Gly-l-Ala) to cyclo(Gly-d-Ala), <b>coryneform</b> <b>rod</b> bacterium T- 1 - 3 -Y was more active towards cyclo(Gly-l-Leu) than towards the corresponding d-enantiomer, and Agrobacterium radiobacter NM 5 - 3 showed no significant preference {{for one of the}} enantiomers of cyclo(Gly-dl-Ala) or cyclo(Gly-dl-Leu) (Kanzaki et al. 2000). None of these strains was strictly enantioselective towards any DKP. Thus, with the novel isolates Paenibacillus sp. 32 A (DSM 27214) and Microbacterium sp. 40 A (DSM 27211) the first enantioselective degradation of a racemic DKP could be demonstrated. Therefore, these two bacteria may be of particular interest for further investigations concerning the characterization of DKP degrading enzymes. Moreover, both strains could be used for industrial applications, e.g., production of enantiopure DKPs or dipeptides.|$|R
30|$|For both strains the {{induction}} of enzyme activity by DKPs was investigated. After cultivation {{with and without}} DKPs, no difference in enzyme activity was measured for DSM 329. In contrast, the degradation of cyclo(l-Asp-l-Phe) by DSM 40062 was shown to be inducible by this DKP during cultivation. The activity increased with raising inductor concentration, but the enzyme was also active without previous induction. Kanzaki et al. (1997) observed comparable results for Arthrobacter sp. 1 - 3 - 1 and <b>coryneform</b> <b>rod</b> bacterium T- 1 - 3 -Y. With these strains the DKP hydrolyzing activity was also induced in presence of DKPs in the cultivation medium.|$|R
40|$|A yellow-pigmented <b>coryneform</b> <b>rod</b> was {{isolated}} from the blood {{of a child with}} acute lymphoblastic leukemia who was perfused with a central venous catheter. The culture bottles were positive twice, at a 2 -month interval. The isolate was identified as a Microbacterium sp. and studied along with five other similar strains. Phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, and genetic characteristics indicated that they are closely related to Microbacterium oxydans but that they belong to a distinct species, for which the name Microbacterium paraoxydans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of M. paraoxydans is CF 36 (T) = DSM 15019 (T). The G+C content of its DNA is 69. 9 mol%...|$|R
30|$|Besides the enzymatical {{cleavage}} of DKPs, {{the microbial}} hydrolysis is {{reported for the}} following bacteria. Bacillus sp. No. 106 degraded cyclo(Gly-Gly) (Muro et al. 1985). Arthrobacter sp. 1 - 3 - 1 and a <b>coryneform</b> <b>rod</b> bacterium T- 1 - 3 -Y hydrolyzed different tyrosine- and glycine-containing DKPs (Kanzaki et al. 1997). Agrobacterium radiobacter NM 5 - 3 cleaved glycine-containing DKPs (Kanzaki et al. 2000). The biodegradation of cyclo(Gly-Leu) was reported to proceed in two steps with two distinct enzymes. A cyclo(Gly-Leu) hydrolase {{is responsible for the}} DKP hydrolysis, and a dipeptidase cleaves the formed dipeptides to the corresponding amino acids (Kanzaki et al. 2000). It is not clear which enzymes are responsible for the catalysis of the first reaction step.|$|R
30|$|In {{our studies}} we could confirm the {{reported}} hydrolysis of cyclo(l-Asp-l-Phe) by Paenibacillus chibensis (DSM 329) and Streptomyces flavovirens (DSM 40062) (Yokozeki et al. 1990). Moreover, DSM 329 was active against cyclo(l-Asp-l-Asp), but no degradation of nine other tested DKPs was measured. DSM 40062 showed no activity towards {{any of the}} ten investigated DKPs. These results indicate high substrate specificity for the enzymes of both strains. High substrate specificity is also reported for the cyclo(Gly-Gly) hydrolase of Bacillus sp. No. 106, which was active towards one of 32 tested DKPs (Muro et al. 1985). In contrast, a relatively wide substrate spectrum was shown for Arthrobacter sp. 1 - 3 - 1 and <b>coryneform</b> <b>rod</b> bacterium T- 1 - 3 -Y with activity towards 12 DKPs (Kanzaki et al. 1997).|$|R
40|$|Three {{strains of}} <b>coryneform</b> <b>rods</b> {{isolated}} from clinical samples {{and one of}} environmental origin exhibited phenotypic and chemotaxonomic properties characteristic of the genus Brevibacterium and their 16 S rRNA gene sequences were closely related (98. 5 - 99. 0 %) to that of Brevibacterium otitidis. However, DNA-DNA hybridization of one strain (CF 87 (T)) showed only 59. 6 % relatedness to the type strain of B. otitidis, DSM 10718 (T), and 75 - 82 % relatedness to the three other strains. The four strains could be differentiated from B. otitidis by cellular fatty acid composition and some phenotypic characteristics. These {{findings suggest that the}} four strains belong to a novel species, for which the name Brevibacterium lutescens sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of B. lutescens is CF 87 (T) (=DSM 15022 (T) =CCUG 46604 (T)) ...|$|R
40|$|Fifteen {{strains of}} CDC group 1 coryneform and biochemically similar {{bacteria}} were isolated from clinical specimens. Of the 15 strains isolated, 11 {{were derived from}} abscesses and purulent lesions, mostly from {{the upper part of}} the body, and 3 were grown from blood cultures. Nine strains were associated with mixed anaerobic but no other aerobic flora. Seven strains exhibited the classical biochemical profile of CDC coryneform group 1; however, eight strains were unable to reduce nitrate and were called "group 1 -like. " Other reactions to differentiate CDC group 1 and group 1 -like <b>coryneform</b> <b>rods</b> include alpha-hemolysis on human blood agar, fermentation of adonitol, and the presence of alkaline phosphatase. Fifteen strains showed marked CAMP reactions on different erythrocyte agars. Gas-liquid chromatography of volatile and nonvolatile fatty acids as well as cellular fatty acid patterns and the composition of cell wall components suggest that CDC group 1 and group 1 -like coryneform bacteria do not belong to the genus Corynebacterium but possibly to the genus Actinomyces or Arcanobacterium. DNA-DNA hybridization studies revealed that group 1 and group 1 -like strains represent different species...|$|R
30|$|The {{cleavage}} of cyclo(l-Asp-l-Phe), cyclo(Gly-l-Phe), cyclo(dl-Ala-dl-Ala) and cyclo(l-Asp-l-Asp) was shown. Hydrolysis of cyclo(l-Asp-l-Phe) {{is described}} for eleven strains (Yokozeki et al. 1990), e.g., Paenibacillus chibensis (DSM 329) and Streptomyces flavovirens (DSM 40062) which {{were also investigated}} within this study. Hydrolysis of cyclo(Gly-l-Phe) is known for Arthrobacter sp. 1 - 3 - 1 und <b>coryneform</b> <b>rod</b> bacterium T- 1 - 3 -Y (Kanzaki et al. 1997), while degradation of cyclo(dl-Ala-dl-Ala) was discovered {{for the first time}} by identification of Leifsonia sp. K 3 (DSM 27212), Bacillus sp. A 16 (DSM 25052), Paenibacillus sp. 32 A (DSM 27214) and Microbacterium sp. 40 A (DSM 27211) as biocatalysts for this substrate. The first microbial hydrolysis of cyclo(l-Asp-l-Asp) was identified by using Paenibacillus chibensis (DSM 329) and Rhizobium sp. NA 04 - 01 (DSM 24917). None of all the examined strains was able to degrade the widespread cyclo(l-Pro-l-Tyr), which is synthesized by bacteria like Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Holden et al. 1999) and Actinomyces sp. (Arunrattiyakorn et al. 2006), fungi e.g., Alternaria alternata (Stierle et al. 1988), and sponges, such as Jaspis digonoxea (Rudi et al. 1994). Furthermore, no strain could be identified for cleavage of the simplest DKP cyclo(Gly-Gly), alkaline DKPs cyclo(l-Arg-l-Arg), cyclo(l-Lys-l-Lys) and three DKPs containing non-proteinogenic amino acids (S)- 3 -benzyl- 1, 4 -dimethyl- 2, 5 -diketopiperazine, 3 -benzyl- 3 -methyl- 2, 5 -diketopiperazine and 1, 3 -dimethyl- 2, 5 -diketopiperazine.|$|R
40|$|Sixty-three {{clinical}} isolates of charcoal-black-pigmented, gram-positive <b>coryneform</b> <b>rods</b> {{were received}} for identification by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and were provisionally designated CDC fermentative coryneform group 4 (FCG 4). Forty-five {{of these were}} characterized by morphological, physiologic, antimicrobial susceptibility, cellular fatty acids, 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, and DNA-DNA hybridization analyses. Nitrate reduction, cellular fatty acid analysis, 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, and DNA-DNA hybridization studies segregated these strains into two groups: FCG 4 a (8 strains) and FCG 4 b (37 strains). The FCG 4 a strains, only {{one of which was}} from a female genitourinary source, produced cellular fatty acid and biochemical profiles similar to those observed with reference strains of Rothia dentocariosa and Rothia mucilaginosa, while the FCG 4 b strains were similar to Corynebacterium species. DNA-DNA hybridization analysis demonstrated species-level relatedness among six FCG 4 a tested strains and showed that they were a charcoal-black-pigmented variant of R. dentocariosa. Sixteen isolates of the FCG 4 b group, mainly from female genitourinary tract specimens, as well as the type strains of two recently named species, Corynebacterium aurimucosum and Corynebacterium nigricans, were shown by DNA-DNA hybridization analysis and the sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene to be related at the species level and unrelated to the type strain of R. dentocariosa; therefore, the Corynebacterium-like strains were classified as a charcoal-black-pigmented variant of C. aurimucosum, because this name has nomenclatural priority over C. nigricans. These findings indicate that FCG 4 represents a heterogeneous group that contains pigmented variants of both R. dentocariosa and C. aurimucosum; hence, the descriptions of both R. dentocariosa and C. aurimucosum have been amended to include charcoal-black-pigmented variants, and C. nigricans is a pro synonym of C. aurimucosum...|$|R
30|$|Between 1998 and 2015, 24 {{clinical}} isolates {{belonging to}} 21 different patients {{were identified as}} Gordonia at the Microbiology Department of Hospital Universitario Donostia, San Sebastian (Basque Country, Spain).Only one isolate per patient was considered for the study. Presumptive identification was established by the growth of characteristic salmon to orange colonies, <b>coryneform</b> Gram-positive <b>rods</b> appearance and non- or slightly-acid-fast bacilli. Biochemical identification was done using the API Coryne system (bioMérieux, France) which contained 20 miniaturized biochemical tests. Definitive species identification was established by sequencing a fragment of 1188  bp of the 16 S rRNA gene using primers 5 F (TGGAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTAG) and 1193 R (ACGTCATCCCCGCTTCCTT). A >[*] 99 % sequence identity with the sequences of Gordonia species available at GenBank using BLAST software ([URL] was used as criteria for species identification.|$|R
40|$|Five {{strains of}} an unknown, multidrug-resistant <b>coryneform,</b> gram-positive <b>rod</b> were {{isolated}} from blood, bronchial aspirate, and abscess specimens. Four {{of the five}} strains isolated were highly resistant to antimicrobial agents, including β-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, quinolones, and tetracyclines, except for glycopeptides. In immunocompromised patients, bacteremia associated with this organism was rapidly fatal. This coryneform bacterium was nonmotile, lipophilic, and nonsaccharolytic. Lack of pyrazinamidase activity differentiated this organism from other lipophilic corynebacteria. Chemotaxonomic studies indicated that this multidrug-resistant coryneform bacterium belongs to the genus Corynebacterium. Comparative 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and DNA-DNA hybridization analyses revealed that the five isolates were genetically identical and that they represent a new subline within the genus Corynebacterium, for which we propose the designation Corynebacterium resistens sp. nov. The type strain of Corynebacterium resistens is GTC 2026 T (SICGH 158 T, JCM 12819 T, CCUG 50093 T) ...|$|R
