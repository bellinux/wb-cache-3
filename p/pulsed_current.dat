40|$|AbstractThe {{growth of}} fatigue crack in {{aluminum}} alloy, 6061 -T 6, under {{the application of}} <b>pulsed</b> electric <b>current</b> was studied. To {{examine the effect of}} <b>pulsed</b> electric <b>current,</b> different electric current densities were used at different fatigue cycles, where the electric current densities were subjected as 90 A/mm 2 and 150 A/mm 2. With the electric current density of 90 A/mm 2, the fatigue life was increased. However, when the current density levels became higher, that is, 150 A/mm 2, the fatigue life was decreased. From the fracture surface observations, the local melting was found on crack surface. It is concluded that the increase of fatigue life is attributed to the crack shielding effect resulted from the local melting induced by the <b>pulsed</b> electric <b>current.</b> In addition, the effect of <b>pulsed</b> electric <b>current</b> was more remarkable in small crack region...|$|R
40|$|The {{transient}} current systems between tethered plasmas {{in a large}} magnetoplasma are investigated experimentally for extrapolation to electrodynamic tethers in space. The studies measure the perturbed magnetic fields and the current density associated with <b>pulsed</b> <b>currents</b> to electrodes in three-dimensional space and time. The electrodes excite electron whistlers because they produce fields that dominantly couple to electrons, allowing <b>pulsed</b> <b>currents</b> to propagate and disperse as whistler wave packets. The wave packets evolve into force-free, flux-ropelike field configurations, and a whistler 'wedge' is formed in the plasma due to 'eddy' currents caused by insulated tethers with dc currents. Substantial radiation into the whistler mode happens with moving VLF antennas as well as tethers, and the wave spread within the ray cone {{is the most significant}} characteristic event. The wave spread widens the current channel, incites current closure, and is also associated with a 'phantom loop' phenomenon...|$|R

A possible anodization cell employs platinum cathode and silicon wafer anode immersed in hydrogen fluoride (HF) electrolyte. Recently, inert diamond cathodes are used to avoid metallic impurities in the electrolyte and inert diamond anodes form an improved electrical back plate contact to the silicon wafers. Corrosion of the anode is produced by running electric current through the cell.
