5|$|An outspoken {{advocate}} of <b>prohibition,</b> he made substantial {{donations to the}} <b>Prohibition</b> Party and Indiana's prohibitionist leader Frank Hanly. Haynes ran an unsuccessful campaign in Indiana for the U.S. Senate in 1916 as a <b>prohibition</b> candidate and remained active in the party until <b>prohibition</b> became law. Later, he became a philanthropist and served two terms {{as president of the}} YMCA, five years on the Indiana Board of Education, and was {{an active member of the}} Presbyterian church. After his death from complications arising from influenza, his Kokomo mansion was converted into the Elwood Haynes Museum and is open to the public where many of his original inventions and automobiles are on display.|$|E
5|$|Another officially {{published}} doctrinal {{change was}} {{that women in}} the church {{would be allowed to}} wear makeup. In the earliest years of the denomination, Armstrong announced the <b>prohibition</b> of makeup for women. In the 1970s that <b>prohibition</b> was lifted, but in 1981 Armstrong reinstituted the teaching. In 1988 Tkach lifted the ban for good.|$|E

5|$|During the <b>Prohibition</b> era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was {{a hotbed}} of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption. Several factors fed into {{resistance}} to <b>Prohibition,</b> including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption. The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade.|$|E
5|$|John Bellinger III, {{who served}} as the U.S. State Department's senior lawyer during President George W. Bush's second term, said the strike was a {{legitimate}} military action and did not run counter to the U.S.' self-imposed <b>prohibition</b> on assassinations:The killing is not prohibited by the long-standing assassination <b>prohibition</b> in executive order 12333 , because the action was a military action in the ongoing U.S. armed conflict with al-Qaeda, and it is not prohibited to kill specific leaders of an opposing force. The assassination <b>prohibition</b> does not apply to killings in self-defense.|$|E
5|$|On January 14, 1919, Indiana {{became the}} twenty-fifth state {{to ratify the}} Eighteenth Amendment, which {{mandated}} nationwide <b>prohibition.</b> Three days later Nebraska became the thirty-sixth state to ratify the amendment, providing the two-thirds majority of states required to amend the U.S. Constitution. With the beginning of nationwide <b>Prohibition</b> on January 17, 1920, after formal ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment the previous day, efforts turned to enforcement of the new law. Protestant support for <b>Prohibition</b> remained intense in Indiana in the 1920s. Shumaker and the IASL lead a statewide grassroots campaign that successfully passed a new <b>prohibition</b> law for the state. Sponsored by Indiana representative Frank Wright and known as the Wright bone-dry law, it was enacted in 1925. The Wright law {{was part of a}} national trend toward stricter <b>prohibition</b> legislation and imposed severe penalties for alcohol possession.|$|E
50|$|Some people {{abstain from}} {{consuming}} various foods and beverages {{in conformity with}} various religious, cultural, legal or other societal <b>prohibitions.</b> Many of these <b>prohibitions</b> constitute taboos. Many food taboos and other <b>prohibitions</b> forbid the meat of a particular animal, including mammals, rodents, reptiles, amphibians, fish, molluscs, crustaceans and insects, which may relate to a disgust response being more often associated with meats than plant-based foods. Some <b>prohibitions</b> are specific to a particular part or excretion of an animal, while others forgo the consumption of plants or fungi.|$|R
50|$|The halakhic {{literature}} {{discusses the}} <b>prohibitions</b> of hirhur (lit. thought) and histaklut (lit. gazing). Many of {{the practices of}} tzniut (modesty) serve to prevent these <b>prohibitions</b> from occurring.|$|R
40|$|Ritual <b>prohibitions</b> are {{depicted}} as essential {{elements in the}} system of folk eating habits. The classification of the <b>prohibitions</b> is stated: the division into <b>prohibitions</b> on the subject and {{the object of the}} action, time bans. The author makes conclusions as for the different character of the eating of horse meat before and after the Baptizm of Rus on the materials of archaeological and written data. Another eating ban (to eat animal blood) is depicted for comparing. The conclusions about the different ways of the development of the <b>prohibitions</b> is made...|$|R

5|$|<b>Prohibition</b> {{was gaining}} {{currency}} in Alberta: the Conservatives had included {{it in their}} 1913 platform, and it {{was supported by the}} increasingly powerful United Farmers of Alberta (UFA). The government generally opposed the idea, and Cross held up Manitoba as example of its failures. But the government had also (at the UFA's behest) introduced direct democracy measures, one of which allowed citizens to initiate plebiscites. The well-organized temperance movement did so on <b>prohibition,</b> which was endorsed in the ensuing plebiscite; the legislature passed the <b>Prohibition</b> Act in the spring of 1916. As Attorney-General, Cross was responsible for enforcing it.|$|E
5|$|The Great Depression and the {{election}} of Democratic party candidates in 1932 ended widespread national support for <b>Prohibition.</b> Franklin D. Roosevelt, who included repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment as a major issue of his presidential campaign in 1932, made good on his promise to American voters. On December 5, 1933, the Twenty-first Amendment repealed the Eighteenth Amendment and ended nationwide <b>Prohibition.</b> However, Indiana's legislature continued to regulate alcohol within the state through allocation of state liquor licenses and <b>prohibition</b> of sales on Sunday.|$|E
50|$|Night flying {{restrictions}} is any regulation or legislation {{imposed by}} a governing body {{to limit the}} ground-perceived exposure to aircraft noise during the night hours, when the majority of residents are trying to sleep. Such regulations may include restrictions to available flight paths, or <b>prohibitions</b> against takeoffs, or <b>prohibitions</b> against takeoffs and landings, or <b>prohibitions</b> against ground operations (engine runups or taxiing).|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} a set of <b>prohibitions</b> and give definitions of a complete set and a crucial word with respect to a given set of <b>prohibitions.</b> We consider three special sets which appear in different areas of mathematics and for each of them examine the length of a crucial word. One of these sets is proved to be incomplete. The problem of determining lengths of words that are free from a set of <b>prohibitions</b> is shown to be NP-complete, although the related problem of whether or not a given set of <b>prohibitions</b> is complete is known to be effectively solvable...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Prohibitions</b> by Rabbinic decree are excluded. The Rabbis made {{a number}} of <b>prohibitions</b> in sexual matters beyond those of the Torah. Adultery with a married man, fornication, certain types of {{homosexual}} conduct (Orthodox authorities and traditionalists within Conservative Judaism consider a broader range of male-male sexual intimacy, including oral sex between men, as forbidden, but not included in the [...] "die rather than transgress" [...] <b>prohibitions.),</b> and various aspects of modesty in dress and conduct are among these rabbinic <b>prohibitions</b> not specifically prohibited by Leviticus 18. Although Maimonides regards lesbian conduct as biblically prohibited on the basis of Sifra on Leviticus 18:3, he does not consider it sexual intercourse proper. Orthodox Judaism recognizes rabbinic <b>prohibitions</b> as being a lesser type of transgression overridden by the imperative to preserve life.|$|R

5|$|After the war, Dow {{returned}} to his leadership of the <b>prohibition</b> movement, co-founding the National Temperance Society and Publishing House with James Black in 1865. He {{spent the rest of}} the 1860s and 1870s giving speeches in support of temperance across the United States, Canada, and Great Britain. His efforts produced little success, as the public turned against <b>prohibition</b> and the alcohol industry was better organized to resist. Dow expended a great deal of effort organizing and giving speeches in support of the Liberal Party before the British elections of 1874, as their leader, William Ewart Gladstone, was sympathetic to prohibition; the Liberals lost decisively, a result Gladstone and Dow blamed on liquor interests. Dow continued to promote <b>prohibition</b> in Britain until May 1875 when, exhausted, he returned home.|$|E
5|$|By 1930, {{the wine}} {{industry}} had weakened {{due to the}} Great Depression and <b>Prohibition.</b> Many vineyards that survived by supplying the home market were located in California's Central Valley, a non-optimal environment for growing quality Zinfandel. Thus, the end of <b>Prohibition</b> left a shortage of quality wine grapes, and Zinfandel sank into obscurity as most was blended into undistinguished fortified wines. However, some producers remained interested in making single varietal red wines.|$|E

50|$|Korea’s Nobi {{system was}} {{originated}} from eight <b>prohibitions.</b> Eight <b>prohibitions</b> prescribed {{that if someone}} steal something from others he/she will be enslaved. If that person is man, he will be No(奴) and if it’s woman, she will called as Bi(婢). It means Nobi is brute people who violate eight <b>prohibitions</b> and Yangban is civilized people. Therefore, it {{is the reason that}} Yanbang enslaved Korean as thought of the saints Jizi’s purpose to educate them.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{additional}} orders {{may be made}} by a judge {{at the time of}} sentencing - either optional or mandatory. These include weapon <b>prohibitions,</b> driving <b>prohibitions,</b> forfeiture of crime-related property, DNA orders, and sex offender registry orders.|$|R
40|$|Traditional access {{controls}} have evolved from being static and coarse-grained to being dynamic and very fine-grained. However, a balance still must be struck: too little access inhibits usefulness, effectively creating {{a denial of}} service for people trying to do their jobs; and too much access invites breaches of security. "Break-the-glass" techniques and adaptive access control have previously been developed to address this issue. But gaps in these techniques still exist. We extend these techniques as follows: consider {{a system in which}} <b>prohibitions</b> fall into two classes. Core <b>prohibitions</b> prevent disaster, and are axiomatic to the system. Ancillary <b>prohibitions,</b> derived from core <b>prohibitions,</b> hinder the ability of an attacker to violate core <b>prohibitions,</b> but are not in and of themselves critical to the security of the system. We introduce optimistic access control, a framework in which core <b>prohibitions</b> are always enforced, and ancillary <b>prohibitions</b> are enforced only when a specific threshold is crossed. The threshold depends upon history, trust, and a variety of non-binary countermeasures. This control deals with many scenarios—including the insider threat and remote access with limited communication—that are extremely difficult to address or even characterize using current techniques. Therefore, these controls address certain gaps. Finally, we present a formal mapping to lattice models, and describe implementation ideas and issues of this method in practice...|$|R
5|$|Dow {{was later}} elected to two {{terms in the}} Maine House of Representatives, but retired after a {{financial}} scandal. He joined the Union Army shortly after {{the outbreak of the}} American Civil War in 1861, eventually attaining the rank of brigadier general. He was wounded at the siege of Port Hudson and later captured. After being exchanged for another officer in 1864, Dow resigned from the military and devoted himself once more to <b>prohibition.</b> He spoke across the United States, Canada, and Great Britain in support of the cause. In 1880, Dow headed the <b>Prohibition</b> Party ticket for President of the United States. After losing the election, he continued to write and speak on behalf of the <b>prohibition</b> movement {{for the rest of his}} life until his death in Portland at the age of 93.|$|E
