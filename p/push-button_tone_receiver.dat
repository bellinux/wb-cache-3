Several options exist in practical OFDM systems—including training symbols, cyclic prefix, virtual carriers, pilot <b>tones,</b> and <b>receiver</b> diversity—to facilitate channel estimation. In this paper, a subspace blind channel estimation method based on exploiting the presence of virtual carriers is proposed for OFDM systems over a time-dispersive channel. The method can be applied to conventional OFDM systems with cyclic prefix as well as OFDM systems with no cyclic prefix. The reduction/elimination of cyclic prefix thereby provides the OFDM systems the potential to achieve higher channel utilization than most previously reported cyclic prefix based estimators. Sufficient channel identifiability condition is developed as well. Comparison with two other recently reported subspace methods is presented via computer simulations to support the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The first radio transmitter, the spark-gap transmitter, produced a string of damped waves {{that sounded like a}} buzz or tone in a radio receiver, so the pulses of radio waves used to transmit Morse code were audible as [...] "beeps" [...] in the receiver. However, the new transmitters like the Goldschmidt alternator generated unmodulated continuous waves, which were inaudible in receivers. To make them audible, the <b>tone</b> wheel <b>receiver</b> used the heterodyne principle to convert the radio frequency to an audio frequency. The tone wheel was a disk with contacts around the rim, spun by a small electric motor, which interrupted the incoming radio signal at a radio frequency rate. The tone wheel acted as a crude beat frequency oscillator (BFO), introducing a second radio frequency which combined with the received signal to create a [...] "beat" [...] (heterodyne) frequency at the difference of the two frequencies, in the audio range. For example, if the frequency of the received signal was 60,000 Hz, the tone wheel could be adjusted to introduce a frequency of 59,000 Hz, creating a 1,000 Hz tone which could be heard in the earphones as a musical [...] "beep" [...] whenever the carrier was present.|$|R

Thus the Morse code [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] are audible as beeping sounds. This technique is still used in radio telegraphy, the local oscillator now being called the beat frequency oscillator or BFO.

5000|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, before modern AM or FM radio {{transmission}} was developed, radio transmitters communicated information by radiotelegraphy; the transmitter was switched off and on by the operator with a telegraph key, producing pulses of radio waves, to spell out text messages in Morse code. Around 1905 the first continuous wave radio transmitters began to replace the earlier spark transmitters. The Morse code signal of the spark transmitter consisted of pulses of radio waves called damped waves which repeated at an audio rate, so they were audible as a buzz or <b>tone</b> in a <b>receivers</b> earphones. In contrast the new continuous wave transmitters produced a signal consisting of pulses of continuous waves, unmodulated sinusoidal carrier waves, which were inaudible in the earphones.

The tuned circuit is adjusted so the oscillator frequency is a little {{to one side of the}} signal frequency. The two frequencies mix in the nonlinear amplifier, generating a heterodyne (beat frequency) signal at the difference between the two frequencies. This frequency is in the audio range, so it is heard as a steady <b>tone</b> in the <b>receiver's</b> speaker whenever the station's carrier is present.

In the proposed receiver structure, equalization and decoding are performed in an iterative fashion. Optimal equalization methods for minimizing the bit error rate use maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation algorithms, which suffer from high computational complexity for large signal constellations and long channel impulse responses. In this approach, the MAP equalizer is replaced by a linear equalizer, based on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion.

In the absence of impedance mismatches between the source and the line, the compensation method improves impedance discontinuity location. Performance of the method degrades considerably when there is an impedance mismatch, but a procedure to compensation for this effect is presented.

A least-squares approach for indirect estimation of the sought for pa-rameters is proposed, which is linear in 6 out of its 7 parameters. The performance of the method, especially its accuracy {{as a function of}} measurement time, imbalance parameters, and signal-to-noise ratios, is investigated. The theoretical predictions of the performance are illustrated by Monte Carlo simulations as well as experimental data obtained from testing several universal software radio peripheral (USRP) receivers. The work shows that for the studied off-the-shelf receivers, gain imbalance and quadrature skew may be predicted accurately (i. e., < 0. 1 dB and < 1 deegre, respectively) by employing baseband data covering only a handful of full periods of the excitation stimuli. Using short records of data, the work also shows that local oscillator leakage adding a bias term in the receiver baseband data may suffer from systematic bias error of order 15 dB in the estimate. To obtain local oscillator leakage estimates with an uncertainty in the order of one dB, the measurement time has to be increased by two orders of magnitude.
