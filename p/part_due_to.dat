5|$|Engelbart {{slipped into}} {{relative}} obscurity after 1976. Several of his researchers became alienated {{from him and}} left his organization for Xerox PARC, in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> frustration, and in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> differing views {{of the future of}} computing. Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked, timeshare (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the personal computer. The conflict was both technical and ideological: the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{tradition}} {{declined in the}} early to mid-twentieth century, in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> opposition from some local Christian clergy and changing social conditions, it was revived in new forms in the mid-to-latter part of the century.

5|$|Columbia {{has many}} bars and {{restaurants}} that provide diverse styles of cuisine, which is in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> it being a college town with three colleges.

5|$|During this period, {{there was}} also {{substantially}} more interaction among the various poetic traditions, in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the spread of European colonialism and the attendant rise in global trade. In addition to a boom in translation, during the Romantic period numerous ancient works were rediscovered.|$|E
5|$|Hwa Chong Institution {{offers a}} wide variety of extra-curricular activities, {{labelled}} Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) by the Ministry of Education, and this is in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the school's large student population and size.|$|E
5|$|India had {{the highest}} total number of TB cases {{worldwide}} in 2010, in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> poor disease management within {{the private and public}} health care sector.

This success was in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the talent of players like David Ginola, Les Ferdinand and Alan Shearer, who was signed on 30 July 1996 for a then world record fee of £15million.|$|E
5|$|Magnus co-ruled with Olaf {{following}} his brother's return to Norway, {{but less than}} three years into his reign, Magnus became ill and died. His kingship has been downplayed in later history in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> this.

5|$|Peanut, or {{groundnut}} (Arachis hypogaea), {{originally from}} South America, {{has grown from}} a relatively minor crop {{to one of the most}} important commercial nut crops, in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the work of George Washington Carver at the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Poe {{was also}} known as a writer of fiction and {{became one of the first}} American authors of the 19th century to become more popular in Europe than in the United States.

5|$|Robert Hooke, Ole Borch, Mikhail Lomonosov, and Pierre Bayen all {{produced}} {{oxygen in}} {{experiments in the}} 17th and the 18th century {{but none of them}} recognized it as a chemical element.

5|$|The Chakri Dynasty of Thailand has {{included}} marriages between royal relatives, but marriages between dynasts and foreigners, including foreign royals, are rare.

5|$|The {{definitive}} {{version of}} the Hunter was the FGA.9, on which the majority of export versions were based. Although the Supermarine Swift had initially been politically favoured by the British Government, the Hunter proved far more successful, and had a lengthy service life with various operators, in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its low maintenance requirements and operating costs.|$|E
