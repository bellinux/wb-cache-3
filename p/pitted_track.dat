50|$|Standard track {{consists}} of straights of various lengths and corners of different radii {{and degree of}} turn. Special track includes several different styles of chicane, cross-over tracks, crossroad track and humpback bridge. Novelty pieces of <b>track</b> have included <b>pit</b> lane <b>tracks,</b> Le Mans start, blow-out track and loop-the-loop tracks.|$|R
50|$|The tracks {{occur in}} the Upper Cretaceous Laramie Formation, {{deposited}} in a semi-tropical swamp about 68 million years ago. The tracks were exposed by a now-discontinued clay mining at the Parfet Clay <b>Pits.</b> The <b>tracks</b> were exposed when the clay layers were removed by the mining, revealing track impressions preserved in the overlying sandstone layers, which are now tilted into a vertical position.|$|R
5000|$|Northwestern's {{athletic}} and recreation facilities [...] consist of the Ericksen Center (1996) (volleyball, men's and women's basketball) and the Reynolds Field complex (2014), which houses the Johnson Tennis Complex and 100 percent artificially turfed fields for baseball, softball, football, soccer and lacrosse.

40|$|Data from lunar {{materials}} {{which may}} be interpreted as suggesting an increase in solar cosmic ray activity approximately 20, 000 years ago is examined. The evidence includes the iron <b>track</b> within <b>pit</b> data of Hartung and Storzer (1974), the lunar whole rock <b>pit</b> and <b>track</b> data, lunar C- 14 radioactivity data, lunar Ni- 59 radioactivity data, the impact <b>pit</b> and iron <b>track</b> data of Morrison and Zinner (1975, 1977) and the lunar thermoluminescence data. While numerous explanations are possible for each set of data, it is shown that the first four data sets {{may be explained by}} a past increase in solar cosmic ray activity, and the remaining data sets are not necessarily incompatible with solar activity a factor of 20 to 40 times higher than at present for several thousand years prior to about 20, 000 years ago...|$|R
50|$|Pasvalys Pieno žvaigždės Arena {{is a small}} {{multifunctional}} {{arena in}} Pasvalys. It was opened in 2011. Arena's capacity is 1200 spectators. It has running <b>tracks,</b> <b>pit,</b> separate boxing hall, 25-meter three-pool tracks and a bathhouse complex.|$|R
50|$|Two Tetherball {{games were}} {{introduced}} {{but as of}} mid-2006, the ropes broke but were soon repaired by student Brayden Postma. Two Four Square games were also made and are used every recess. The baseball field is used rarely during recess. Twin soccer fields are used almost daily. There are 4 sand <b>pits</b> for <b>track</b> and field and two basketball courts. The playground consists of 2 slides, fire pole, monkey bars, and tic tac toe game.|$|R
50|$|Windjammer Surf Racers was {{a unique}} coaster; it {{involved}} small Wild Mouse-like trains running on a full size track. There were two independent tracks (red and yellow) that were constructed parallel to each other, in which {{the purpose of the}} ride was to <b>pit</b> both <b>tracks</b> in a race against each other. The coaster's rider load/unloading platform did not have an airgate system to keep queuing guests clear from advancing vehicles within the station.|$|R
5000|$|On May 31, 1997, {{the venue}} hosted a post-Olympic {{track and field}} event that <b>pitted</b> Olympic <b>track</b> champions Donovan Bailey and Michael Johnson, in a 150 m race that was billed as a {{competition}} {{for the title of}} the [...] "World's Fastest Man". Bailey won the race, completing it in a time of 15 seconds and winning the $1.5 million prize. Johnson pulled up lame at the 110 m mark claiming a quadriceps injury.|$|R
25|$|On May 30, 1996, an {{employee}} was killed while crossing the {{tracks in the}} roller coaster's station. She slipped and fell into a shallow <b>pit</b> beneath the <b>tracks</b> and {{was struck by a}} train that was pulling into the station.|$|R
50|$|Auburn High School's sports venue {{is called}} Auburn Memorial Field. New as of August 2006, the {{centerpiece}} is a lighted 1000 seat FieldTurf stadium {{surrounded by a}} 6 lane track. The stadium is used for AHS Football, AHS Soccer (boys and girls) and AHS Track and Field (boys and girls). In addition, the stadium has two long jump runways and sand <b>pits</b> for <b>Track</b> and Field, {{as well as a}} pole vault and high jump area.|$|R
50|$|After Mansell won {{his home}} Grand Prix, the British spectators invaded the race track to congratulate their hero. Mansell's car {{was blocked by}} the crowd, {{preventing}} him from driving back to the pits. Eventually Mansell was returned to the <b>pits</b> by <b>track</b> marshals to attend the podium ceremony. The win was the 28th of Mansell's career, thus making him the successful British Formula One driver of all time in terms of wins (surpassing Jackie Stewart's 27).|$|R
5000|$|Nakhiloo Island (Also: Nakhilo, Nakhilu, Nokhailo) (Persian: جزیره نخیلو, jazireye Nakhiloo [...] ) {{is one of}} the Iranian {{islands in}} the Persian Gulf. This small island has an area ca. 6 km2, has a sandy {{coastline}} of some 8 km, and is 5 km distant from Ommolkaram. Observations can be made of body <b>pits</b> and <b>tracks</b> signifying considerable hawksbill turtle nesting with several tens of activities in evidence. This is nesting site. The island is located southeast of Bushehr.|$|R
50|$|These {{facilities}} include Pit Complex, Race/Safety Control Room, Timekeeping Room, Media Centre, VIP Suite and Stewards Room. A Medical Centre {{is situated}} behind the <b>Pit</b> area for <b>track</b> emergencies during major events.At {{the rear of}} the Pits is a traditional racing paddock for team staff and hospitality.|$|R
50|$|At that time, Qadian had no {{significance}} in the area at all with population {{of a few hundred}} people and only a sandy <b>track</b> <b>pitted</b> with pot holes connected the town with Batala. People were totally ignorant and uneducated. There was total lack of urban amenities and facilities.|$|R
50|$|In 1997 {{permission}} was give {{to build}} a track in a disused china clay <b>pit.</b> A small <b>track</b> was built with very basic facilities, the referee's control room was a converted caravan, which was replaced eventually by a double decker bus. The Gulls entered the Amateur League, which became the Conference League.|$|R
50|$|The school {{also has}} three large playing fields. One has {{athletics}} facilities (a sand <b>pit</b> and running <b>track),</b> one has football posts {{and the third}} is a 5G astro-turf pitch. The schools sporting facilities were reduced in wake of the construction of the FUSE Media Centre but have now been fully reinstated.|$|R
50|$|The river {{encounters}} the Vail Hydro Dam {{and runs}} to a gravel pit. The Little Falls, about a mile above the Great Falls, have about a 20 ft descent. The river proceeds from the gravel <b>pit</b> and railroad <b>tracks</b> to the Great Falls Dam downstream. It briefly widens to pond size south of Murray Circle.|$|R
40|$|Locomotive {{and rolling}} stock {{condition}} {{is an important}} element of railway safety, reliability, and service quality. Traditionally, railroads have monitored equipment condition by conducting regular inspections. Over the past several decades, certain inspection tasks have been automated using technologies that have reduced the cost and increased the effectiveness of the inspection. However, the inspection of most aspects of railroad equipment undercarriages is conducted manually. This is a labor-intensive process and often requires that railroad equipment be taken out of service so that the inspection can be conducted on specially equipped <b>pit</b> <b>tracks.</b> Machine vision technology offers the potential to quickly and automatically monitor, assess, record, and transmit detailed information regarding the condition of railroad equipment undercarriages and components. Multi-spectral imaging (e. g. visible and infrared range) allows recording of both physical and thermal condition and correlation between the two. This allows precise comparison of any undercarriage component or element of interest using templates, and/or references to previously recorded inspections, of the same or similar equipment and enables other analyses such as trending of component wear and detection of progressive increases in component heating over time. Multi-spectrum machine vision algorithms can determine if a component is outside its normal operating range and if anomalies are correlated across different spectra. The inspection tasks of particular interest for this investigation include disc brake condition, bearing performance, and detection of incipient failure of electrical systems such as locomotive traction motors and air conditioning units. We are also investigating detection of damaged or missing components and foreign objects...|$|R
50|$|Roary the Racing Car is set {{around a}} fictional {{motor racing circuit}} called Silver Hatch (a {{portmanteau}} {{of the names of}} the two British Grand Prix racing circuits, Silverstone and Brands Hatch). The majority of the action takes place at the <b>track's</b> <b>pits</b> and workshop, although we often follow the cars on their laps around the track. Occasionally, the characters venture to external locations such as the nearby beach.|$|R
30|$|In [78], the {{behavior}} of a Time-To-Live (TTL) based caches is analyzed with a Pending Interest Table (PIT) in NDN, in which each content is associated with a timer assuming that the request arrivals can be described as renewal processes which generalizes the classical IRM. The <b>PIT</b> keeps <b>track</b> of all the Interests that a router has forwarded but are not satisfied yet, a content is evicted from the cache when its timer expires. Replacement-based caching policies are mapped to TTL-based caching policies, and then expressions for cache hit probability, response time perceived by the users, {{and the size of the}} Pending Interest Table are derived. Applying the model proposed in [78], the traditional caching policies such as LRU, FIFO, and RANDOM can also be analyzed.|$|R
50|$|Al Unser, Sr. led {{the first}} 48 laps. He {{gave up the}} lead to A. J. Foyt during a pit stop on lap 49. One lap later, Foyt entered the pits, giving the lead to Lloyd Ruby. Suddenly Ruby was given the black flag for smoke due to broken drive gears. Ruby's {{dramatic}} race was over after completing only 54 laps. Meanwhile, Johnny Rutherford stalled exiting the <b>pits,</b> losing considerable <b>track</b> position.|$|R
50|$|From {{its opening}} in 1950, Rouen-Les-Essarts was {{recognized}} as one of Europe's finest circuits, with modern <b>pits,</b> a wide <b>track,</b> and spectator grandstands. The street circuit (which ran on public roads) had a few medium straights, a cobbled hairpin turn (Nouveau Monde) at the southernmost tip, and a few blind corners through a wooded hillside The appeal was greatly enhanced by the climb from Nouveau Monde at 56 metres to Gresil at 149 metres.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the event}} {{removed from the}} A1GP {{calendar}} because the local promoter and organisers, who are responsible to the project of track construction, have {{failed to meet the}} requisite completion deadlines and the track is not yet able to homologate by the FIA before 6-8 February 2009. The track was used for some local racing events, but has since fallen out of use. The <b>pits</b> and the <b>track</b> sign remained to this day.|$|R
50|$|In 1912 {{the lines}} were opened to {{passenger}} services operated by the GWR as well as mineral trains, {{making it easier for}} miners and other workers to travel up and down the valley. This service ceased in 1941 due to the exigencies of the Second World War, but the viaduct remained in use until 1980 when the last mineral train left Blaenavons' Big <b>Pit</b> mine. The <b>track</b> was shortly dismantled by British Rail thereafter.|$|R
50|$|The circuit {{was closed}} down in 1994 due to {{economic}} and safety reasons, {{since it is}} very hard to organise a race on public roads if modern safety standards are to be met. In 1999, following the circuit's closure all evidence of area's racing past was demolished, including grandstands, <b>pits,</b> Armco and <b>track</b> signs. The cobbled Nouveau Monde hairpin was also asphalted but it is still possible to drive around on the original circuit configuration.|$|R
50|$|The event see young drivers {{compete with}} KF3 karts, a class for top drivers aged 12 to 15. The course circuit follows {{the lower part}} of the famous Formula One track, in a large section of the port, from Tabac corner, round the {{swimming}} pool, and on to the Rascasse before entering the F1 <b>track's</b> <b>pit</b> lane. A ramp and a hairpin connect this part of the track back to the port section.|$|R
50|$|The {{vision for}} the {{underground}} city was originally that of urbanist Vincent Ponte, for whom a commemorative plaque was unveiled in November 2006 at Place Ville-Marie. The first link of the underground city arose {{with the construction of}} the Place Ville-Marie office tower and underground shopping mall, built in 1962 to cover an unsightly <b>pit</b> of railway <b>tracks</b> north of the Central Station. A tunnel linked it to Central Station and the Queen Elizabeth Hotel.|$|R
