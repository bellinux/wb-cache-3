5|$|Waters began touring {{in support}} of the album, aided by Clapton, a new band, new material, and a {{selection}} of Pink Floyd favourites. Waters débuted his tour in Stockholm on 16 June 1984. Poor ticket sales plagued the tour, and some of the larger venues had to be cancelled. By his own estimate, he lost £400,000 on the tour. In March 1985, Waters went to North America to play smaller venues with the <b>Pros</b> <b>and</b> Cons Plus Some Old Pink Floyd Stuff—North America Tour 1985. The <b>Pros</b> <b>and</b> Cons of Hitch Hiking has been certified Gold by the RIAA.|$|E

He later stated that he used the album {{to distance himself from}} Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The <b>Pros</b> <b>and</b> Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.|$|E
5|$|Hurt by {{losses to}} the Akron <b>Pros</b> <b>and</b> Buffalo All-Americans, the Bulldogs did not contend for the APFA trophy in 1920. Following the season, Thorpe left {{to start a}} new club {{composed}} of Native Americans in LaRue, Ohio and Cap Edwards took over as head coach. Sportswriter Bruce Copeland compiled the All-Pro list for the 1920 season, naming the Bulldogs' Wilbur Henry to the first team. Cub Buck, Harry Dadmun, and Joe Guyon were on the second team, and Pete Calac was on the third team. Three men who played for the 1920 Canton Bulldogs were later inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Thorpe and Pete Henry in 1963 and Guyon in 1966.|$|E
5|$|In July 1978, amid a {{financial}} crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented the group with two original ideas for their next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall, and the other would later become Waters' first solo album, The <b>Pros</b> <b>and</b> Cons of Hitch Hiking. Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former to be their next album. Bob Ezrin co-produced, and he wrote a forty-page script for the new album. Ezrin based {{the story on the}} central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences, the most notable of which was {{the death of his father}} in World War II. This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett. At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person.|$|E

40|$|The {{first order}} {{derivative}} of UV spectrometry method for simultaneous determination of Propranolol hydrochloride (<b>PRO)</b> <b>and</b> Flunarizine dihydrochloride (FLU) in pure bulk drug and combined dosage form {{was found to}} be simple, accurate, fast, precise and reproducible. The first derivative values measured at 289 nm for <b>PRO</b> <b>and</b> 253 nm for FLU. The linearity for zero order derivative method was carried out by using the concentration range 4 - 28 µg/ml for <b>PRO</b> <b>and</b> 3 - 7 µg/ml for FLU. The coefficient correlation of <b>PRO</b> <b>and</b> FLU for zero order {{was found to be}} 0. 9995 and 0. 9991 respectively. At zero crossing point of PRO (289 nm) FLU showed a measurable derivative absorbance where as at the zero crossing point of FLU (253 nm), PRO showed appreciable derivative absorbance value. The coefficient correlation of <b>PRO</b> <b>and</b> FLU for first order derivative was found to be 0. 9991 and 0. 9995 respectively. Precision study showed that % RSD was within the range of acceptable limits (< 2). The % recovery for <b>PRO</b> <b>and</b> FLU was found to be in the range of 98 - 102 % and 100 - 101 % respectively. The percentage assay was found to be as 99. 5 and 100. 12 % for <b>PRO</b> <b>and</b> FLU. The results of analysis have been validated as per ICH Q 2 (R 1) guidelines. This method has applied successfully for the determination of <b>PRO</b> <b>and</b> FLU in its combination with a high percentage of recovery good accuracy and precision...|$|R

5|$|The Buccaneers {{opened the}} Ray Perkins era by setting team records for points scored, total yardage, margin of victory, and {{touchdown}} passes thrown. Steve DeBerg was 24 of 34 for 333yards and five touchdowns, throwing touchdowns {{on each of}} the Buccaneers' first four possessions. DeBerg's five touchdown passes still stands as a Buccaneers record, having been tied by Brad Johnson in 2002. Perkins, who had played with Joe Namath in college and Johnny Unitas in the <b>pros,</b> <b>and</b> drafted Phil Simms with the Giants, said that DeBerg had one of the best games of any quarterback with whom he had been associated. In a completely dominating performance, the Buccaneers controlled the ball for 38minutes, allowed no sacks, and converted 14 of 16 third-down attempts. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers defense had four sacks and three turnovers. DeBerg did throw one interception, but on the very next play cornerback Bobby Futrell intercepted David Archer's overthrow of tight end Ken Whisenhunt.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{stakeholders}} {{in many countries}} such as The United States who report several concerns in the usage of rules-based accounting. According to recent studies, many believe that the principles-based approach in financial reporting would not only improve but would also support an auditor upon dealing with client’s pressure. As a result, financial reports could be viewed with fairness and transparency. When the U.S. switched to International accounting standards, they are composed that this would bring change. However, as a new chairperson of the SEC takes over the system, the transition brings a stronger review about the <b>pros</b> <b>and</b> cons of rules- based accounting. While the move towards international standards progresses, there are small amount of research that examines the effect of principle- based standards in an auditor’s decision- making process. According to 114 auditing experts, most are willing to allow clients to manage their net income based on rules- based standards. These results offers insight to the SEC, IASB and FASB in weighing the arguments in the debate of principles- vs. rules based- accounting.|$|E
5|$|In the yeshiva world, the {{brightest}} students are highly desirable as chavrusas. However, there are <b>pros</b> <b>and</b> cons to learning with chavrusas who are stronger, weaker, or equal in knowledge {{and ability to}} the student. A stronger chavrusa will correct and fill in the student's knowledge and help him improve his learning techniques, acting more like a teacher. With a chavrusa who is equal in knowledge and ability, the student is forced to prove his point with logic rather than by right of seniority, which improves his ability to think logically, analyze other people's opinions objectively, and accept criticism. With a weaker chavrusa, who often worries over and questions each step, the student is forced to understand the material thoroughly, refine and organize his thoughts in a logical structure, present his viewpoint clearly, {{and be ready to}} justify each and every point. The stronger chavrusa helps the student acquire a great deal of information, but the weaker chavrusa helps the student learn how to learn. Yeshiva students are usually advised to have one of each of these three types of chavrusas in order to develop on all three levels.|$|E
