5|$|The {{political}} {{freedom of the}} American republic exerted a similar pull. Swedish peasants {{were some of the}} most literate in Europe, and consequently had access to the European egalitarian and radical ideas that culminated in the Revolutions of 1848. The clash between Swedish liberalism and a repressive monarchist regime raised <b>political</b> <b>awareness</b> among the disadvantaged, many of whom looked to the U.S. to realize their republican ideals.|$|E
5|$|Writing for The Escapist, Allen Varney {{felt that}} the <b>political</b> <b>awareness</b> was overstated because the {{percentage}} of The Movies films that offered social commentary remained small and because the machinima and political communities were mostly separate. He argued that machinima's outstanding copyright issues and possible marginalization constrained potential for expression. Marino and others added concerns that, although game developers had condoned machinima, a controversial film could prompt them to control machinima content by enforcing their copyrights.|$|E
5|$|As <b>political</b> <b>awareness</b> {{among the}} black {{majority}} {{on the island}} spread, so did bebop, a kind of jazz which was associated, in the United States, with social activism and Afrocentrism. The first Barbadian bebop musician from the island was Keith Campbell, a pianist who had learned to play many styles while living in Trinidad {{during a time when}} American soldiers were stationed there, providing a ready market for bands that could play American music. Other musicians of this period included Ernie Small, a trumpeter and pianist, and bandleader St. Clare Jackman.|$|E

5|$|Student {{activism}} became {{common in}} the 1960s, reflecting the various social and political events of the time period. Vietnam War protests were common in downtown Bowling Green and on campus. In 1969, a Black Student Union formed to encourage unity, scholarship, leadership, culture and <b>political</b> <b>awareness</b> of African Americans students. The majority of student activism at BGSU was peaceful and Bowling Green was the only public college or university in Ohio to remain open {{in the spring of}} 1970, following the Kent State shootings during anti-war protests.|$|E
5|$|Tan {{brought to}} the club his <b>political</b> <b>awareness</b> of Chinese matters. In 1928, {{following}} a public outrage over a massacre at Jinan (known as the Jinan Incident) in Shandong {{in which more than}} 5,000Chinese soldiers and civilians were slaughtered by the Japanese, the club set up the Shandong Relief Fund. Its purpose was to raise funds for China, to create awareness amongst the Chinese about the Japanese invasion of China, and to encourage the Chinese to boycott Japanese goods and services. The Chinese community contributed a total of S$1.34 million within a year of its inception.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} Protestant missionaries {{on a large}} scale {{beginning}} in 1814 was a primary contributor to the development of <b>political</b> <b>awareness</b> among Sri Lankan Tamils. Activities by missionaries of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and Methodist and Anglican churches led to a revival among Hindu Tamils who created their own social groups, built their own schools and temples, and published their own literature to counter the missionary activities. The success of this effort led to a new confidence for the Tamils, encouraging them {{to think of themselves as}} a community, and it paved the way for their emergence as a cultural, religious, and linguistic society in the mid-19th century.|$|E

5|$|The artist's {{reputation}} {{was such that}} {{he had already been}} called to Rome a number of times in the early 1540s; first by Cardinal Pietro Bembo and then by the Farnese family. By the mid-1540s Titian was the preferred portraitist for the Farnese. Following a number of earlier portraits of Pier Luigi and Paul, they commissioned a set to mark their ascendancy after Paul's papacy, all of which were– given their <b>political</b> <b>awareness</b> and ambition– clearly intended as public statements on their social elevation. Paul was aware of Titian's influence in Venice, and after 1538 allowed only Titian to portray him.|$|E
5|$|Gil {{started to}} play music {{as a child and}} was still a {{teenager}} when he joined his first band. He {{began his career as a}} bossa nova musician, and then grew to write songs that reflected a focus on <b>political</b> <b>awareness</b> and social activism. He was a key figure in the Música popular brasileira and tropicália movements of the 1960s, alongside artists such as longtime collaborator Caetano Veloso. The Brazilian military regime that took power in 1964 saw both Gil and Veloso as a threat, and the two were held for nine months in 1969 before they were told to leave the country. Gil moved to London, but returned to Bahia in 1972 and continued his musical career, as well as working as a politician and environmental advocate.|$|E

25|$|Benna (or bennah) is an uptempo Antiguan {{folk song}} that was {{introduced}} following {{the prohibition of}} slavery.

25|$|The primary {{responsibility}} of the missionaries was to convert {{as many people as}} possible. They used education and medical missionary work to assist them. But they also published ridiculing and insulting material on native religion and practices. The popular deity Lord Murugan was specifically targeted. This started the backlash against Christian missionaries. Many early converts like C. W. Thamotharampillai and Carol Visvanathapillai came back to Hinduism. This also resulted in formation of many Hindu Schools and more <b>political</b> <b>awareness</b> for native Tamils. Today around 10% are Christians with Catholics forming 90% of the Christians in Sri Lanka.|$|E
