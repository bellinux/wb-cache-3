He created a new lighting system based on Argand lamps; in 1812 the United States Congress purchased his patent rights for the system. In so doing, it awarded him a contract to equip all American lighthouses with the lamps; the fitting took four years. In 1815 Lewis won another contract with Samuel H. Smith, Commissioner of Revenue, which gave him a monopoly over the provision of winter <b>pressed</b> <b>Spermaceti</b> oil for lighthouses throughout the eastern seaboard. It also allowed him to visit the lighthouses yearly to ensure their smooth operation.|$|E
