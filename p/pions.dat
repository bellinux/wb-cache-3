5|$|In {{his later}} years, Fermi {{continued}} {{teaching at the}} University of Chicago. His PhD students in the post-war period included Owen Chamberlain, Geoffrey Chew, Jerome Friedman, Marvin Goldberger, Tsung-Dao Lee, Arthur Rosenfeld and Sam Treiman. Jack Steinberger was a graduate student. Fermi conducted important research in particle physics, especially related to <b>pions</b> and muons. He made the first predictions of pion-nucleon resonance, relying on statistical methods, since he reasoned that exact answers were not required when the theory was wrong anyway. In a paper co-authored with Chen Ning Yang, he speculated that <b>pions</b> might actually be composite particles. The idea was elaborated by Shoichi Sakata. It has since been supplanted by the quark model, in which the pion {{is made up of}} quarks, which completed Fermi's model, and vindicated his approach.|$|E
5|$|A hadron is a {{composite}} particle made of quarks held together by the strong force. Hadrons are categorized into two families: baryons (such as protons and neutrons) made of three quarks, and mesons (such as <b>pions)</b> made of one quark and one antiquark. Of the hadrons, protons are stable, and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable. Other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions and are thus insignificant constituents of the modern Universe.|$|E
5|$|Less than 10 {{armoured}} vehicles, IFVs and APCs, {{were destroyed}} in combat. Two BMP-2s were destroyed in combat {{and two were}} captured. At least 20 BMPs were captured after the hostilities, including several BMP-1s that were upgraded to BMP-1U. Georgia lost two Otokar Cobra armoured vehicles. Dozens of automobiles and lorries were also lost. Two DANA self-propelled howitzers of the Georgian army were destroyed in combat and two DANAs were captured in and near Gori. Further 20 artillery pieces, including 120 mm mortars, were left behind. Six 2S7 <b>Pions</b> were captured after the hostilities. Two Buk-M1s launch vehicles and their transport loaders, as well as up to five OSA-AKM SAMs were also captured. The Russian military seized 1,728 firearms at the Senaki Second Infrantry Brigade base.|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck(IBUU) transport model, we studied the effects of the <b>pion</b> potential and the symmetry energy on the <b>pion</b> production in the central ^ 197 Au+^ 197 Au collisions around the <b>pion</b> production threshold. It is found that the <b>pion</b> potential has opposite effects on the value of π^-/π^+ ratio at low and high <b>pion</b> energies. The effect of the <b>pion</b> potential on the total π^-/π^+ ratio becomes larger in heavy-ion collisions at beam energies below the <b>pion</b> production threshold. And at beam energies below the <b>pion</b> production threshold, with the <b>pion</b> potential, the effect of the symmetry energy on the π^-/π^+ ratio becomes smaller compared with that above the <b>pion</b> production threshold.

40|$|The {{saturation}} {{properties of}} the nuclear matter taking <b>pion</b> correlations into account is studied. We construct a Bogoliubov transformations for the <b>pion</b> pair operators and calculate the energy associated with the <b>pion</b> pairs. The <b>pion</b> dispersion relation is investigated. We next study the correlation energy due to one <b>pion</b> exchange in nuclear matter and neutron matter at random phase approximation using the generator coordinate method.

5|$|After the war, Fermi {{served under}} J. Robert Oppenheimer on the General Advisory Committee, which advised the Atomic Energy Commission on nuclear matters and policy. Following the {{detonation}} {{of the first}} Soviet fission bomb in August 1949, he strongly opposed {{the development of a}} hydrogen bomb on both moral and technical grounds. He was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the 1954 hearing that resulted in the denial of the latter's security clearance. Fermi did important work in particle physics, especially related to <b>pions</b> and muons, and he speculated that cosmic rays arose through material being accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space. Many awards, concepts, and institutions are named after Fermi, including the Enrico Fermi Award, the Enrico Fermi Institute, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station, and the synthetic element fermium, making him one of 16 scientists who have elements named after them.|$|E
25|$|Not all of {{that energy}} can be {{utilized}} by any realistic propulsion technology {{because of the nature}} of the annihilation products. While electron–positron reactions result in gamma ray photons, these are difficult to direct and use for thrust. In reactions between protons and antiprotons, their energy is converted largely into relativistic neutral and charged <b>pions.</b> The neutral <b>pions</b> decay almost immediately (with a lifetime of 85 attoseconds) into high-energy photons, but the charged <b>pions</b> decay more slowly (with a lifetime of 26 nanoseconds) and can be deflected magnetically to produce thrust.|$|E
25|$|Extensions of the PCAC ideas allowed Steven Weinberg to {{calculate}} the amplitudes for collisions which emit low energy <b>pions</b> from the amplitude for the same process with no <b>pions.</b> The amplitudes are those given by acting with symmetry currents on the external particles of the collision.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the <b>pion</b> {{structure in the}} region of low and moderately high momentum transfers: at low Q^ 2, the <b>pion</b> is treated as a composite system of constituent quarks; at moderately high momentum transfers, Q^ 2 = 1025 GeV^ 2, the <b>pion</b> is calculated within perturbative QCD taking into account one [...] gluon hard exchange. Using the data on <b>pion</b> at Q^ 2 < 3 GeV^ 2 and <b>pion</b> axial [...] vector decay constant, we reconstruct the <b>pion</b> in the soft and intermediate regions. This very wave function combined with one [...] gluon hard scattering amplitude allows a calculation of the <b>pion</b> in the hard region Q^ 2 = 1025 GeV^ 2. A specific feature of the reconstructed <b>pion</b> is a quasi [...] zone character of the qq̅ [...] excitations. On the basis of the obtained <b>pion</b> and the data on deep inelastic scattering off the <b>pion,</b> the valence quark distribution in a constituent quark is determined.

40|$|The SciBooNE Collaboration {{reports a}} {{measurement}} of neutral current coherent neutral <b>pion</b> production on carbon by a muon neutrino beam with average energy 0. 8 GeV. The separation of coherent from inclusive neutral <b>pion</b> production has been improved by detecting recoil protons from resonant neutral <b>pion</b> production. We measure {{the ratio of}} the neutral current coherent neutral <b>pion</b> production to total charged current cross sections to be (1. 16 +/- 0. 24) x 10 - 2. The ratio of charged current coherent <b>pion</b> to neutral current coherent <b>pion</b> production is calculated to be 0. 14 + 0. 30 - 0. 28, using our published charged current coherent <b>pion</b> measurement.

25|$|An {{experimental}} observation made in 1964 that K-longs rarely decay {{into two}} <b>pions</b> was {{the discovery of}} CP violation (see below).|$|E
25|$|The eigenstates are {{obtained}} by diagonalizing this matrix. This gives new eigenvectors, {{which we can}} call K1 which {{is the sum of}} the two states of opposite strangeness, and K2, which is the difference. The two are eigenstates of CP with opposite eigenvalues; K1 has CP=+1, and K2 has CP=−1 Since the two-pion final state also has CP=+1, only the K1 can decay this way. The K2 must decay into three <b>pions.</b> Since the mass of K2 is just a little larger than the sum of the masses of three <b>pions,</b> this decay proceeds very slowly, about 600 times slower than the decay of K1 into two <b>pions.</b> These two different modes of decay were observed by Leon Lederman and his coworkers in 1956, establishing the existence of the two weak eigenstates (states with definite lifetimes under decays via the weak force) of the neutral kaons.|$|E

25|$|A goldstone boson is a massless {{excitation}} of a {{field that}} has been spontaneously broken. The <b>pions</b> are quasi-goldstone bosons (quasi- {{because they are not}} exactly massless) of the broken chiral isospin symmetry of quantum chromodynamics.|$|E
25|$|The weak {{interactions}} are current-current interactions ultimately because {{they come from}} a non-Abelian gauge theory. The Goldberger Treiman relation suggests that the <b>pions</b> for some reason interact {{as if they are}} related to the same symmetry current.|$|E

25|$|Now, imagine {{starting}} at the bottom left corner of the phase diagram, in the vacuum where μ=T=0. If we heat up the system without introducing any preference for quarks over antiquarks, this corresponds to moving vertically upwards along the T axis. At first, quarks are still confined and we create a gas of hadrons (<b>pions,</b> mostly). Then around T=150MeV there is a crossover to the quark gluon plasma: thermal fluctuations break up the <b>pions,</b> and we find a gas of quarks, antiquarks, and gluons, as well as lighter particles such as photons, electrons, positrons, etc. Following this path corresponds to travelling far back in time (so to say), {{to the state of}} the universe shortly after the big bang (where there was a very tiny preference for quarks over antiquarks).|$|E
25|$|To every {{particle}} one can assign {{an intrinsic}} parity {{as long as}} nature preserves parity.

25|$|When {{cosmic rays}} enter the Earth's {{atmosphere}} they collide with atoms and molecules, mainly oxygen and nitrogen. The interaction produces {{a cascade of}} lighter particles, a so-called air shower secondary radiation that rains down, including x-rays, muons, protons, alpha particles, <b>pions,</b> electrons, and neutrons. All of the produced particles stay within about one degree of the primary particle's path.|$|E

25|$|Ignoring the massless problem, as Yang and Mills did, {{the theory}} makes a firm prediction: the vector {{particle}} should couple to all particles {{of a given}} isospin universally.

25|$|When Nf=2, i.e., {{only the}} up and down quarks are treated as massless, the three <b>pions</b> are the Goldstone bosons.
