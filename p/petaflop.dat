IBM Roadrunner, {{which was part of}} this network, was the first supercomputer to hit <b>petaflop</b> speeds.|$|E
25|$|As the price/performance {{of general}} purpose graphic {{processors}} (GPGPUs) has improved, {{a number of}} <b>petaflop</b> supercomputers such as Tianhe-I and Nebulae have started to rely on them. However, other systems such as the K computer continue to use conventional processors such as SPARC-based designs and the overall applicability of GPGPUs in general purpose high performance computing applications {{has been the subject}} of debate, in that while a GPGPU may be tuned to score well on specific benchmarks its overall applicability to everyday algorithms may be limited unless significant effort is spent to tune the application towards it. However, GPUs are gaining ground and in 2012 the Jaguar supercomputer was transformed into Titan by replacing CPUs with GPUs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{limits of}} {{specific}} approaches {{continue to be}} tested, as boundaries are reached through large scale experiments, e.g., in 2011 IBM ended its participation in the Blue Waters petaflops project at the University of Illinois. The Blue Waters architecture {{was based on the}} IBM POWER7 processor and intended to have 200,000 cores with a petabyte of [...] "globally addressable memory" [...] and 10 petabytes of disk space. The goal of a sustained <b>petaflop</b> led to design choices that optimized single-core performance, and hence a lower number of cores. The lower number of cores was then expected to help performance on programs that did not scale well to a large number of processors. The large globally addressable memory architecture aimed to solve memory address problems in an efficient manner, for the same type of programs. Blue Waters had been expected to run at sustained speeds of at least one <b>petaflop,</b> and relied on the specific water-cooling approach to manage heat. In the first four years of operation, the National Science Foundation spent about $200 million on the project. IBM released the Power 775 computing node derived from that project's technology soon thereafter, but effectively abandoned the Blue Waters approach.|$|E
