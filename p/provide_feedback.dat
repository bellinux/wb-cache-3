It was released on March22, 2012. Like its predecessors, V7 can run Folding@home in the background at a very low priority, allowing other applications to use CPU resources as they need. It is designed to make the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients. V7 uses Trac for managing its bug tickets so that users can see its development process and <b>provide</b> <b>feedback.</b>|$|E
40|$|In web forms, <b>feedback</b> can be <b>provided</b> {{to users}} at {{different}} points in time. This study investigates these three ways of <b>providing</b> <b>feedback</b> to find which results in the shortest completion time, which results in the lowest number of gaze revisits to input fields, and which type of feedback the users prefer. This was investigated through development of prototypes that were tested with 30 participants in a within-group design after which they were interviewed about their experiences. <b>Providing</b> <b>feedback</b> instantly or after form submission resulted in significantly shorter completion times than <b>providing</b> <b>feedback</b> after users left a field. <b>Providing</b> <b>feedback</b> instantly also resulted in significantly fewer revisits to input fields compared to <b>providing</b> <b>feedback</b> after leaving a field. Through a thematic analysis, users’ experiences were shown to be the most negative when given feedback after form submission, while the most positive experiences occurred when users were given feedback immediately. The results indicate that <b>providing</b> <b>feedback</b> immediately may be an equally good or better alternative to earlier research recommendations to provide feedback after form submission and that revisits to areas of interest may, with further research, be a measurement of optimal scanpath disruption...|$|R
