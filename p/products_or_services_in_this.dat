When the firm moves far from its existing knowledge base, it incurs increasing development costs that hamper its success. The firm is anchored to its history by these increasing costs that guide its long-run path of technology development.

Finally, for the heterogeneity of consumer valuations, we compare the total profits of the four pricing strategies under different values of the substitution coefficient to obtain the optimal pricing and product strategies under the coexistence of strategic and myopic consumers. According to the result, we find that when the fraction of high-type consumers and the gap between high and low valuations is big, or when they are both small, traditional single pricing shows its benefit. However, when the green crowdfunding products are better than their substitute, a line of green products {{is more likely to be}} optimal...|$|E

Taking the business perspective of a small enterprise with focused technological capabilities, we examine here the role of innovations for competitiveness. We present a framework that is useful for classifying and characterising different types of {{technological innovations}} and describe their impact on fi rms ’ capabilities. The narrow focus of small enterprises enables them to develop into niche players with specialised capabilities; however, it often prevents them from offering complete <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> context, we identify and discuss the needs of such enterprises for survival and growth and describe two alternative models of support to improve the success rate. Devanath Tirupati is Professor of Operations Management at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, India. It is well recognised that technological capabilities and related innov-ations have the potential to signifi cantly enhance competitiveness of fi rms. In the new economies of the late 20 th and 21 st centuries characterised by globalisation and growing competition, innovation has emerged as a major source of competitive strength, and competing through innovation has become a successful paradigm for fi rms in many industries. Tradition-ally, technological developments and innovations have been perceived as internal activities confi ned to R&D divisions of fi rms. However, re-cent trends suggest that this perspective is changing and collaborative development—both within the fi rm and beyond is becoming an important driver of technological capabilities. The impetus for these developments comes from two factors. First, products and production technologies are becoming more complex, requiring diverse capabilities that are beyon...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this project is to assess the {{environmental}} impacts associated with the wood pellet production. The study has extended to the entire life cycle of wood pellet, which includes the up- and down-stream processes. Therefore it leaves the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) the best method to carry out such study. LCA is a popular tool for evaluating environmental impacts of <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> study, the mainstream LCA methodology is adopted, which includes four steps starting from goal and scope definition, life cycle inventory analysis, to life cycle impact assessment, and interpretation. The {{results of the study}} will be used for the wood pellet producer to communicate with its customers and also facilitate a better environmental management. The entire life cycle of wood pellet can be divided into eight main processes. According to the results of inventory analysis, the Silviculture is the most fossil fueldependant process, while the Pellet Production is, however, the most energy-intense process. Regarding the emissions, the final Combustion process contributes most to the air emissions, but the Pellet Production has a remarkably high emission of hydrocarbons, which can be explained as incomplete combustion of a mass of biofuel. The resources use, on the other hand, is close related to the consumption of electricity, since the electricity production is included in the system. The process with bigger demand of electricity results in bigger amount of resources use. When it comes to the characterisation level, the inventory data have been aggregated and translated into real environmental impacts. There are at least six different environmental impacts are possible to be initiated from the wood pellets production. It is noted that the Silviculture and the final Combustion are the least environmental preferable processes, due to the relatively big environmental impacts potential in relation to these two processes. There are three valuation methods involved in the report to weigh the importance of the environmental impacts against from one to another. The results of the three valuation methods are somehow different, which is, however, only because the methods tend to weight the importance of the environmental impacts from different perspective, and there is no such best weighting method exits. At last, a sensitivity analysis is given to discuss the hot points in the report, which is about to test the uncertainties of the data. Plus a discussion part is made {{at the end of the}} report to discuss the account of carbon dioxide emission in bioenergy system, and a crude comparison of avoided green house gas emission of using different kind of wood energy...|$|E
40|$|As the Internet {{continues}} to penetrate consumer households, online marketing is getting increasingly important for firms. By adapting to online strategies, firms are blessed (or doomed) with {{a plethora of}} new business models. The information flows created in the process poses both opportunities and challenges for marketers. On one hand, information flows captured online are usually easier to be stored and processed, thus empowering firms to be better informed about the consumers or the market itself. On the other hand, {{how to use the}} information flows to make the correct managerial decisions is still a challenging task for managers and academics alike. My dissertation studies the marketing implications of these information flows. Broad as the research question is, my dissertation focuses on specific market settings. I adopt both analytical and empirical methodologies to study information flows in these markets. Overall, this dissertation concludes that information flows can engender new market mechanisms, can provide valuable information of unobservable market forces, and can be created to improve social welfare. Essay 1 : Innovation Incentives for Information Goods. Digital goods can be reproduced costlessly. (cont.) Thus a price of zero would be economically-efficient for consumers. However, zero revenues would eliminate the economic incentives for creating such goods in the first place. We develop a novel mechanism which tries to solve this dilemma by decoupling the price of digital goods from the payments to innovators while maintaining budget balance and incentive compatibility. Specifically, by selling digital goods via large bundles the marginal price for consuming an additional good can be made zero for most consumers. Thus efficiency is enhanced. Meanwhile, we show how statistical sampling can be combined with tiered coupons to reveal the individual demands for each of the component goods in such a bundle. This makes it possible to provide accurate payments to creators which spurs further innovation. In our analysis of the proposed mechanism, we find that it can operate with an efficiency loss of less than 0. 1. Essay 2 : Edgeworth Cycles in Keyword Auctions. Search engines make a profit by auctioning off advertisement positions through keyword auctions. I examine the strategies taken by the advertisers. (cont.) A game theoretical model suggests that the equilibrium bids should follow a cyclical pattern- "escalating" phases interconnected by "collapsing" phases - similar to a pattern of "Edgeworth Cycles" that was suggested by Edgeworth (1925) in a different context. I empirically test the validity of the theory. With an empirical framework based on maximum likelihood estimation of latent Markov state switching, I show that Edgeworth price cycles exist in this market. I further examine, on the individual bidder level, how strategic these bidders are. My results suggest that some bidders in this market adjust their bids according to Edgeworth predictions, while others not. Finally, I discuss the important implications of finding such cycles. Essay 3 : The Lord of the Ratings. Third-party reviews {{play an important role in}} many contexts in which tangible attributes are insufficient to enable consumers to evaluate <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> paper, I examine the impact of professional and amateur reviews on the box office performance of movies. I first show evidence to suggest that the generally accepted result of "professional critics as predictors of movie performance" may no longer be true. (cont.) Then, with a simple diffusion model, I establish an econometrics framework to control for the interaction between the unobservable quality of movies and the word-of-mouth diffusion process, and thereby estimate the residual impact of online amateur reviews on demand. The results indicate the significant influence of the valence measure (ratings) of online reviews, but their volume measure (propensity to write reviews) is not significant once I control for quality. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that the variance measure (disagreement) of reviews does not play a significant role in the early weeks after a movie's opening. The estimated influence of the valence measure implies that a one-point increase in the valence can be associated with a 4 - 10 % increase in box office revenues. by Xiaoquan (Michael) Zhang.

Kendini muhafazakâr kimlikle konumlandıran 7 kadın izleyici ile gerçekleştirilen fokus grup çalışmasında, sağlık programlarına yönelik kadın izleyici yaklaşımları gözlemlenmiştir. Çalışma, televizyon kanallarında yayınlanan medikal/estetik konulu sağlık program içeriklerinin, kendini muhafazakâr kimlik altında konumlandıran kadın izleyiciler tarafından nasıl alımlandığı ve bu yöndeki tüketim davranışlarının nasıl değiştiğini, anlamak amacıyla yapılmıştır. Çalışmada; katılımcılar her ne kadar eğitimli ve medyanın bu alandaki etkisinin farkında olan, yüksek bilince sahip bir grup olsa da sağlık söz konusu olduğunda, estetik operasyonun tercihi, muhafazakâr kimliğin veya dini referansların önüne geçtiği gözlemlenmiştir. Çalışma grubu, sağlık gibi gerekçelerle tüketim toplumuyla, daha çok bir meta dönüşen sağlığın bu tarafını rasyonelleştirmiştir. Kamusal alanda kimliğiyle var olma mücadelesi veren muhafazakâr kadın, medya aracılığıyla, yoğun bir şekilde sunulan medikal/estetik sağlık programlarının tüketimi karşısında, her ne kadar etkin olarak kendini görse de kaçınılmaz bir şekilde edilgen bir özne olarak konumlanabileceği bulguları tespit edilmiştir. Although {{the history}} of {{communication}} tools is very old, the researches {{for the effects of}} these tools on the audience has become a focus of interest in the early 20 th century. One of the most important reasons for this interest is the growing concern about the delivery of manufactured goods to mass buyers in an increasing understanding of capitalist production. At the beginning, The mass communication was originally thought to be the process of transmitting the public message to the sender. In this sense, the first time mass media theory explores "what the media does to people", the audience's use of media and the interpretation of messages are neglected. In time, the message given by the mass media communication tools has a very different effect on the audience creating the changing structure of mass communication models; cultural, interpreting, and critical approach models have been developed. In this way, they created "active/passive audience" debates which are fundamental problems in mass communication researches. Taking into account the effects of mass media, Denis McQuail has applied a triple classification to the researches done in this field (Tokgöz, 2015, s. 26) : The Period of Strong Impact (1920 - 1940), The Period of Limited Impact (1940 - 1960, and Strong Impact Period again (1960 and after) It is accepted that the influences of mass media (newspapers, radio) in the 1920 - 1940 is called the period of strong influence. The general approach in this period is that the message sent on the mass media finds individuals and leaves a great influence on the individuals. The period of the limited influence that the messages given by mass media are considered to have not so great effect on the viewer / listener / reader. The Limited Impact Model supported more of the communications industry and communications producers. After 1960, the powerful effects of mass media began to be mentioned again. David Morley interprets this as " [...] . from" effects "to" functions " [...] . and back again" (Morley, 1992, s. 44). In this period, television is now more active on the audience. Stuart Hall’s, "Coding-encoding” pioneering work, has given a new perspective to audience researches. As long as the messages contain more than one meaning, Hall indicates in the "Coding-encoding" that the media messages are read by the audience as negotiators. Hall emphasizes that the ideological field was established through television but was threatened by multiple readings or critical interpretations of this field, emphasizes that the viewer passes from the passive subject to the active. The word "conservatism" is derived from the Latin word "Conservation" and spread to the world from the Frenchword “Conservateur”. The concept of "conservative" on the daily basis has different meanings. This concept may have the meanings specified by the act of modest or cautious behavior, a traditionally harmonious way of life, fear of change or rejection of change. Culture in terms of conservatism it symbolizes the past not the future. The emergence of conservatism concerns the emergence of modernitarian and modernization processes. An ideology and doctrine shaped {{in the context of the}} opposition to modernization. For this reason, conservatism is perceived as anti-modern (Yücebaş, 2013, s. 8, 18). After 1980, conservatism reached a level close to today's liberalism. In Turkey, conservatism emerged with the Republican era. Conservatism, which seeks to occupy itself in the right politics in Turkey, attaches importance to preserving the historical experience and achievements and maintaining the achievements of the Turkish modernization. The mass media play a central role in presenting a new way of life to individuals in the context of the cultural rationale of late capitalism, as consumption becomes a lifestyle. In developing countries such as Turkey, large masses are convinced to be consumers as much as possible through media and consumption habits are gained. The products that meet the basic purpose requirements of the media are to present identities that will be identified with the values given to them together with their consumer products, and to purchase these artificial identities (Dağtaş & Dağtaş, 2009, s. 65). While it is believed that conservatism often evokes an opposition to consumerism, it is not surprising that they both coexist. This partnership has similar benefits for both social perspectives and even brings them closer together as a relationship of interest. The appearance of the Islamic female image in the public sphere dates back to the 1960 s. After the beginning of the 1990 s, with the political positions and economic empowerment achieved, the conservative woman has been "seen in the most elegant way" was basic concern. As a resulth this,the concept of fashion, and entartaiment has become available together with tesettur (Balkanlıoğlu, 2014, s. 13). After 1980, neo-liberal politics in Turkey led to the consequent economic relaxation and expansion of the capital to different social classes, a new conservative middle class with its own lifestyle and consumption practices. The image-based evaluation criteria of the public sphere is almost imperative to look modern and well-behaved for conservative woman who want to come to better places in business world. In this context, this study was conducted in order to understand how the contents of medical/ aesthetic health programs, broadcasted on television channels, are received by female viewers who position themselves under a conservative identity and to understand consumption behaviors in this direction. In modern society, health consumption is no longer a necessity, it is not any more well being; it’s to look fit, to look good, to earn status, to claim as value. Of course, the role of the media can not be denied in the commodification of health in this respect. In this context, the influence of the spread of special television channels in particular can not be excluded. Especially when the impact of new health consumption trends on secular /modern women is more easily observed by the public. The purpose of this research is what is the attitude of the conservative women towards these medical / aesthetic health programmes and this new understanding of consumption. This study is an etnographic research about the perception of female audience, who identify themself as conservative, regarding medical/aesthetic television programmes. The methodology used in this study is a focus group that involves 7 females. It has been observed that, no matter the well educated level and the awareness of that the audience has about the affect of mass media, when it comes to health, medical/aesthetic operations are prefered instead of conservative identity or religious references by rationalizing the consuming health <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> study, findings were detected that In the face of these programmes, the conservative female audience sees herself as an active subject but inevitably can be positioned as passive subject. Participants rationalized this aspect of health which turned into a commodity in consumer society. Thus the conservative women refer to religious references despite the internal conflicts that the boundaries of the social identity they are in...|$|E
