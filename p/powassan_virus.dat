Recently, a new flavivirus, deer tick (DT) virus, related to POW virus was isolated in the United States, but neither its pathogenic potential in human nor the taxonomic relationship with POW virus has been elucidated. In this study, we obtained the near-full-length genomic sequence of the DT virus and complete sequences of 3 genomic regions of 15 strains of POW-related virus strains. The phylogeny revealed 2 lineages, one of which had the prototype POW virus and the other DT virus. Both lineages can cause central nervous system infection in humans.

40|$|Arthropod-borne flavivirus {{infection}} {{continues to}} cause significant {{morbidity and mortality}} worldwide. Identification of drug targets and novel antiflaviviral compounds to treat these diseases has become a global health imperative. A previous screen of 235, 456 commercially available small molecules identified the 2 -thioxothiazolidin- 4 -one family of compounds as inhibitors of the flaviviral NS 5 capping enzyme, a promising target for antiviral drug development. Rational drug design methodologies enabled identification of lead compound BG- 323 from this series. We have shown previously that BG- 323 potently inhibits NS 5 capping enzyme activity, displays antiviral effects in dengue virus replicon assays and inhibits growth of West Nile and yellow fever viruses with low cytotoxicity in vitro. In this study we further characterized BG- 323 's antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo. We found that BG- 323 was able to reduce replication of WNV (NY 99) and <b>Powassan</b> <b>viruses</b> in culture, and {{we were unable to}} force resistance into WNV (Kunjin) in long-term culture experiments. We then evaluated the antiviral activity of BG- 323 in a murine model. Mice were challenged with WNV NY 99 and administered BG- 323 or mock by IP inoculation immediately post challenge and twice daily thereafter. Mice were bled and viremia was quantified on day three. No significant differences in viremia were observed between BG- 323 -treated and control groups and clinical scores indicated both BG- 323 -treated and control mice developed signs of illness on approximately the same day post challenge. To determine whether differences in in vitro and in vivo efficacy were due to unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties of BG- 323, we conducted a pharmacokinetic evaluation of this small molecule. Insights from pharmacokinetic studies indicate that BG- 323 is cell permeable, has a low efflux ratio and does not significantly inhibit two common cytochrome P 450 (CYP P 450) isoforms thus suggesting this molecule may be less likely to cause adverse drug interactions. However, the T 1 / 2 of BG- 323 was suboptimal and the percent of drug bound to plasma binding proteins was high. Future studies with BG- 323 will be aimed at increasing the T 1 / 2 and determining strategies for mitigating the effects of high plasma protein binding, which likely contribute to low in vivo efficacy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Infected deer ticks (Ixodes scapularis) {{were allowed}} to attach to naive mice for {{variable}} lengths of time to determine the duration of tick attachment required for <b>Powassan</b> (POW) <b>virus</b> transmission to occur. Viral load in engorged larvae detaching from viremic mice and in resulting nymphs was also monitored. Ninety percent of larval ticks acquired POW virus from mice that had been intraperitoneally inoculated with 105 plaque-forming units (PFU). En-gorged larvae contained approximately 10 PFU. Transstadial transmission efficiency was 22 %, resulting in approxi-mately 20 % infection in nymphs that had fed as larvae on viremic mice. Titer increased approximately 100 -fold during molting. Nymphal deer ticks efficiently transmitted POW virus to naive mice after as few as 15 minutes of attachment, suggesting that unlike Borrelia burgdorferi, Babesia microti, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, no grace period exists between tick attachment and POW virus transmission. Pathogens transmitted by ticks frequently require a period of reactivation and/or replication prior to being transmitted from an infected tick to a naive host.

40|$|<b>Powassan</b> (POW) <b>virus,</b> {{the cause}} of human {{encephalitis}} in the northeastern U. S. and Canada, is transmitted by tick bite. Since the geographic and host distribution patterns of Ixodes dammini Spielman, et al, 1979 and POW virus overlap, the potential of this tick species to transmit POW virus was explored. Transmission experiments were conducted with hamsters and rabbits which fed immature and adult ticks, respectively, from a POW-free colony. Oral infection rates in larvae and nymphs fed on POW-infected hamsters were 10 % and 40 %, respectively; in females fed on POW-infected rabbits, 57 %. Transstadial transmission rates for nymphs exposed to POW virus as larvae, adults exposed as larvae, and adults exposed as nymphs, were 9. 5 %, 10 % and 54 %, respectively. Evidence of transovarial transmission was acquired when 2 clean hamsters feeding F$ sb 2 $ larvae and nymphs originally exposed to virus in the F$ sb 1 $ nymphal stage seroconverted to POW virus with hemagglutination inhibition titers of 80 and 5120, respectively, on week 4 post-tick-drop-off. The transovarial transmission rate was 16. 6 %. All developmental stages were able to transmit POW virus orally to clean hosts regardless of when the ticks were originally exposed to virus.

40|$|Of {{more than}} 500 arboviruses {{recognized}} worldwide, 5 were first isolated in Canada and 58 were first {{isolated in the}} United States. Six of these viruses are human pathogens: western equine encephalitis (WEE) and eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) viruses (family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus), St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) and <b>Powassan</b> (POW) <b>viruses</b> (Flaviviridae, Flavivirus), LaCrosse (LAC) virus (Bunyaviridae, Bunyavirus), and Colorado tick fever (CTF) virus (Reoviridae, Coltivirus). Their scientific histories, geographic distributions, virology, epidemiology, vectors, vertebrate hosts, transmission, pathogenesis, clinical and differential diagnoses, control, treatment, and laboratory diagnosis are reviewed. In addition, mention is made of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) complex viruses (family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus), which periodically cause human and equine disease in North America. WEE, EEE, and SLE viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes between birds; POW and CTF viruses, between wild mammals by ticks; LAC virus, between small mammals by mosquitoes; and VEE viruses, between small or large mammals by mosquitoes. Human infections are tangential to the natural cycle. Such infections range from rare to focal but are relatively frequent where they occur. Epidemics of WEE, EEE, VEE, and SLE viruses have been recorded at periodic intervals, but prevalence of infections with LAC and CTF viruses typically are constant, related {{to the degree of}} exposure to infected vectors.

50|$|Powassan encephalitis, {{caused by}} the <b>Powassan</b> <b>virus</b> (POWV), as flavivirus {{also known as the}} deer tick virus, is a form of {{arbovirus}} infection that results from tick bites. It can occur as a co-infection with Lyme disease since both are transmitted to humans by the same species of tick. There has been a surge in the number of cases and geographic range in the last decade. In the United States, cases have been recorded in the northeast. The disease was first isolated from the brain of a boy who died of encephalitis in Powassan, Ontario, in 1958.

Traditionally, this involved poisoning and trapping, methods that were not always safe or effective. More recently, integrated pest management attempts to improve control {{with a combination of}} surveys to determine the size and distribution of the pest population, the establishment of tolerance limits (levels of pest activity at which to intervene), interventions, and evaluation of effectiveness based on repeated surveys. Interventions may include education, making and applying laws and regulations, modifying the habitat, changing farming practices, and biological control using pathogens or predators, as well as poisoning and trapping. The use of pathogens such as Salmonella has the drawback that they can infect man and domestic animals, and rodents often become resistant. The use of predators including ferrets, mongooses and monitor lizards has been found unsatisfactory. Domestic and feral cats are able to control rodents effectively, provided the rodent population is not too large. In the UK, two species in particular, the house mouse and the brown rat, are actively controlled to limit damage in growing crops, loss and contamination of stored crops and structural damage to facilities, as well as to comply with the law.|$|E
