The wide-band-gap MOSs (Eg >  3  eV) having suitable band position relative to dye (or photosensitizer) have been used for the fabrication of DSSCs. Owing to the wide band gap, the MOSs employed for the fabrication of DSSCs have absorption at the ultraviolet region. Therefore, photosensitizer/dye is responsible for the absorption of light at the visible and near-infrared region. Furthermore, the high surface area of nanoporous MOS increases dye loading; thereby enhancing light absorption leading to improved performance of DSSCs. In addition to the above-mentioned physical characteristics, low cost, natural abundance, and facile synthesis methods of MOS combined with facile solution processibility is another key advantage for the application in DSSCs [71, 112, 113].|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} issue that limits {{the efficiency of}} many photoelectrochemical systems is that the photon absorption length is typically much longer than the electron diffusion length. Various photon management schemes {{have been developed to}} enhance light absorption; one simple approach is to use randomly scattering media to enable broadband and wide-angle enhancement. However, such systems are often opaque, making it difficult to probe photo-induced processes. Here we use wave interference effects to modify the spatial distribution of light inside a highly-scattering dye-sensitized solar cell to control photon absorption in a space-dependent manner. By shaping the incident wavefront of a laser beam, we enhance or suppress photocurrent by increasing or decreasing light concentration on the front side of the mesoporous photoanode where the collection efficiency of photoelectrons is maximal. Enhanced light absorption is achieved by reducing reflection through the open boundary of the photoanode via destructive interference, leading to a factor of two increase in photocurrent.
