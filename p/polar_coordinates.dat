5|$|There {{are various}} {{accounts}} of the introduction of <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> {{as part of a}} formal coordinate system. The full history of the subject is described in Harvard professor Julian Lowell Coolidge's Origin of <b>Polar</b> <b>Coordinates.</b> Grégoire de Saint-Vincent and Bonaventura Cavalieri independently introduced the concepts in the mid-seventeenth century. Saint-Vincent wrote about them privately in 1625 and published his work in 1647, while Cavalieri published his in 1635 with a corrected version appearing in 1653. Cavalieri first used <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> to solve a problem relating to the area within an Archimedean spiral. Blaise Pascal subsequently used <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> to calculate the length of parabolic arcs.|$|E
5|$|The actual term <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> {{has been}} {{attributed}} to Gregorio Fontana and was used by 18th-century Italian writers. The term appeared in English in George Peacock's 1816 translation of Lacroix's Differential and Integral Calculus. Alexis Clairaut was the first to think of <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> in three dimensions, and Leonhard Euler was the first to actually develop them.|$|E
5|$|From the 8th century AD onward, astronomers {{developed}} {{methods for}} approximating and calculating the direction to Mecca (qibla)—and its distance—from any {{location on the}} Earth. From the 9th century onward they were using spherical trigonometry and map projection methods to determine these quantities accurately. The calculation is essentially {{the conversion of the}} equatorial <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> of Mecca (i.e. its longitude and latitude) to its <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> (i.e. its qibla and distance) relative to a system whose reference meridian is the great circle through the given location and the Earth's poles, and whose polar axis is the line through the location and its antipodal point.|$|E

40|$|In Cartesian {{coordinate}} systems, {{the angular}} separation-based star identification algorithms involve much trigon- ometric function computing. That delays the algorithm process. As in a <b>polar</b> <b>coordinate</b> system, the coordinates are denoted by angular values, it is potential {{to speed up}} the star identification process by adopting a <b>polar</b> <b>coordinate</b> sys-tem. An angular <b>polar</b> <b>coordinate</b> system is introduced and a grid algorithm based on the coordinate system is proposed to enhance the performances of the star identification process. The simulations demonstrate that the algorithm in the angular <b>polar</b> <b>coordinate</b> system is superior to the grid algorithm in the rectangle Cartesian coordinate system in com-puting cost and identification rate. It can be used in the star sensors for high precision and high reliability in spacecraft navigation...|$|R

5|$|The {{concepts}} of angle and radius were already used by ancient {{peoples of the}} first millennium BC. The Greek astronomer and astrologer Hipparchus (190–120 BC) created a table of chord functions giving {{the length of the}} chord for each angle, and there are references to his using <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> in establishing stellar positions.|$|E
5|$|Consider a {{particle}} moving under an arbitrary central force F1(r) whose magnitude depends {{only on the}} distance r between the particle and a fixed center. Since the motion of {{a particle}} under a central force always lies in a plane, {{the position of the}} particle can be described by <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> (r,θ1), the radius and angle of the particle relative to the center of force (Figure1). Both of these coordinates, r(t) and θ1(t), change with time t as the particle moves.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Aiming at {{solving the}} problem of {{correcting}} barrel distortion of image, this paper concluded the common correction algorithms into three types which include Affine Transformation, Two Degree Polynomial Transformation and <b>Polar</b> <b>Coordinate</b> Transformation, and introduced the basic theory of each of their representative algorithm. Then, analyzed and compared {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of them according to the correction experiments. At last, pointed out the research directions and difficulties of this field. In conclusion, <b>Polar</b> <b>Coordinate</b> Transformation is the most appropriate method to correct barrel distortion image, and the improved algorithm based on <b>Polar</b> <b>Coordinate</b> Transformation is more flexible to work out current difficulties of this aspect...|$|R
25|$|There are {{two common}} methods for {{extending}} the polar coordinate system to three dimensions. In the cylindrical coordinate system, a z-coordinate {{with the same}} meaning as in Cartesian coordinates {{is added to the}} r and θ <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> giving a triple (r,θ,z). Spherical coordinates take this a step further by converting the pair of cylindrical coordinates (r,z) to <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> (ρ,φ) giving a triple (ρ,θ,φ).|$|E
25|$|In <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates,</b> {{every point}} of the plane is {{represented}} by its distance r from the origin and its angle θ from the polar axis.|$|E
25|$|Many other {{coordinate}} {{systems have been}} developed since Descartes, such as the <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> for the plane, and the spherical and cylindrical coordinates for three-dimensional space.|$|E

25|$|When {{going from}} one to more space dimensions, a number of {{statements}} from one-dimensional systems can still be applied. Planar or curved wave fronts are typical structures, and a new effect arises as the local velocity of a curved front becomes dependent on the local radius of curvature (this {{can be seen by}} going to <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates).</b> This phenomenon leads to the so-called curvature-driven instability.|$|E
25|$|The {{geodetic}} latitude, {{or any of}} {{the auxiliary}} latitudes defined on the reference ellipsoid, constitutes with longitude a two-dimensional coordinate system on that ellipsoid. To define the position of an arbitrary point it is necessary to extend such a coordinate system into three dimensions. Three latitudes are used in this way: the geodetic, geocentric and reduced latitudes are used in geodetic coordinates, spherical <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> and ellipsoidal coordinates respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} the complex plane allows a {{geometric}} interpretation of complex numbers. Under addition, they add like vectors. The multiplication of two complex numbers can be expressed most easily in <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> — the magnitude or modulus of the product {{is the product of}} the two absolute values, or moduli, and the angle or argument of the product is the sum of the two angles, or arguments. In particular, multiplication by a complex number of modulus 1 acts as a rotation.|$|E

25|$|Each branch L(z) of lognbsp&z on an {{open set}} U is an inverse of a {{restriction}} of the exponential function, namely the restriction {{to the image of}} U under L. Since the exponential function is holomorphic (i.e., complex differentiable) with nonvanishing derivative, the complex analogue of the inverse function theorem applies. It shows that L(z) is holomorphic at each z in U, and L′(z) = 1/z. Another way to prove this is to check the Cauchy–Riemann equations in <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because {{there are}} often many {{different}} possible coordinate systems for describing geometrical figures, {{it is important to}} understand how they are related. Such relations are described by coordinate transformations which give formulas for the coordinates in one system in terms of the coordinates in another system. For example, in the plane, if Cartesian coordinates (x,y) and <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> (r,θ) have the same origin, and the polar axis is the positive x axis, then the coordinate transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by x=rcosθ and y=rsinθ.|$|E
25|$|Also in the 9th century, the Persian {{mathematician}} and geographer, Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi, employed {{spherical trigonometry}} and map projection methods {{in order to}} convert <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> to a different coordinate system centred on a specific point on the sphere, in this the Qibla, the direction to Mecca. Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī (973–1048) later developed ideas which are seen as an anticipation of the polar coordinate system. Around 1025, he describes a polar equi-azimuthal equidistant projection of the celestial sphere. However, this type of projection {{had been used in}} ancient Egyptian star-maps and was not to be fully developed until the 15 and 16th centuries.|$|E
50|$|Systems {{displaying}} radial symmetry provide natural {{settings for}} the <b>polar</b> <b>coordinate</b> system, {{with the central}} point acting as the pole. A prime example of this usage is the groundwater flow equation when applied to radially symmetric wells. Systems with a radial force are also good candidates {{for the use of}} the <b>polar</b> <b>coordinate</b> system. These systems include gravitational fields, which obey the inverse-square law, as well as systems with point sources, such as radio antennas.|$|R
