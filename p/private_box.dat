5|$|Although {{no longer}} a Rangers employee, Smythe was invited to the Rangers' opening game in Madison Square Garden by Tex Rickard, an {{invitation}} he nearly turned down because he had felt the Rangers had short-changed him. Hammond paid Smythe $7,500 to settle his contract, and Smythe felt he was owed $10,000. At the insistence of his wife Irene, they traveled to New York and attended the opener in Rickard's <b>private</b> <b>box.</b> When the Rangers won the game, surprising the Montreal Maroons, Rickard offered Smythe a vice-presidency with the club. Smythe turned the Rangers down, {{partly because of the}} disputed $2,500, although Rickard ordered Hammond to pay off the rest. On the return trip to Toronto, Conn and Irene visited Montreal, where Smythe bet the $2,500 on a football game between Toronto and McGill. He then bet the $5,000 he won on the Rangers to defeat the St. Pats in Toronto, winning again, turning the $2,500 into $10,000 in three days. The Rangers won the Stanley Cup in 1928, their second year of existence, largely with the players Smythe had brought to the team.|$|E

His wife Elena died in 1897 and in 1899 he married Nina Boucicault (Nina was a first cousin of her namesake, Nina Boucicault, the celebrated Irish stage and film actress), who helped him entertain on a lavish scale. He had acquired a strong interest in horse-racing while in Australia, and maintained a <b>private</b> <b>box</b> at Epsom racecourse.|$|E
500|$|On {{at least}} one occasion, Merrick was able to fulfil a long-held desire to visit the theatre. Treves, {{with the help of}} Madge Kendal, {{arranged}} for him to attend the Christmas pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Treves sat with some nurses, concealed in Baroness Burdett-Coutts' <b>private</b> <b>box.</b> According to Treves, Merrick was [...] "awed" [...] and [...] "enthralled". [...] "The spectacle left him speechless, so that if he were spoken to he took no heed". For weeks following the show Merrick talked about the pantomime, reliving the story {{as if it had been}} real.|$|E

500|$|When the Ottawa Hockey Club began play, {{there was}} no {{division}} between the ice surface and the stands like today. The fans became quite wet in the times when the temperature was warm. In the 1903 Stanley Cup Final against the Montreal Victorias, the Governor-General (who had a <b>private</b> <b>box</b> seat at the ice's edge) is recorded as getting wet from the play. On another occasion, in the 1906 Stanley Cup Final against the Wanderers, the Governor-General's top hat was knocked off by the stick of Ernie [...] "Moose" [...] Johnson. The top hat was taken by a fan and given to Johnson.|$|E
500|$|Offenbach {{was well}} known for parodying other composers' music. Some of them saw the joke and others did not. Adam, Auber and Meyerbeer enjoyed Offenbach's parodies of their scores. Meyerbeer {{made a point of}} {{attending}} all Bouffes-Parisiens productions, always seated in Offenbach's <b>private</b> <b>box.</b> Among the composers who were not amused by Offenbach's parodies were Berlioz and Wagner. Offenbach mocked Berlioz's [...] "strivings after the antique", and his initial light-hearted satire of Wagner's pretensions later hardened into genuine dislike. Berlioz reacted by bracketing Offenbach and Wagner together as [...] "the product of the mad German mind", and Wagner, ignoring Berlioz, retaliated by writing some unflattering verses about Offenbach.|$|E
500|$|Thunder appears {{primarily}} at home games, {{but has been}} transported out-of-state when the Broncos played in the Super Bowl. While at home, Thunder arrives at Mile High approximately two-and-a-half hours before kickoff. [...] He is trailered into the stadium via the visitor's tunnel. He has a large <b>private</b> <b>box</b> stall located next to the visitor's locker room, and has hay, water and treats, including a big basket of carrots and apples. Judge signs autographs for about 45 minutes before each game, allowing fans, particularly children, an opportunity to become better acquainted with Thunder. Thunder usually leaves the field before the game is over. [...] He is loaded into a horse trailer and hauled out of the stadium at the two-minute warning.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the book when Cal discusses his family's history and actions prior to his birth, he speaks in an androgynous voice, with limited omniscience; he acknowledges that he is fabricating some of the details. John Mullan, University College London's professor of English and a contributor to The Guardian, wrote that by permitting Cal to be unrealistically aware of fellow characters' thoughts, Eugenides intentionally contravenes an elementary standard in storytelling fiction. In the novel's closing pages, Cal provides minute details about his father's dying moments and thoughts in a nonsensical car accident even though he is several thousand miles from the scene and only learns of the tragedy from his brother. Cal has the ability to dwell in the minds of others because as a female who has become a male, his identity is not confined by his own body. According to Mullan, this [...] "mobility of identification becomes a narrative principle" [...] and is thoroughly exploited in Middlesex. The novel follows the principle that people are molded by events prior to their birth, and Eugenides explores a character's prenatal life in terms of his or her genes; the narrator is, however, subject to the principle that whatever he does not know is of his imagination. As such, contradictory statements highlight the unreliable nature of Cal's narration. While narrating the story that pre-dates his birth, he remarks, [...] "Of course, a narrator in my position (prefetal at the time) can't be entirely sure about any of this." [...] However, he later says, [...] "I alone, from the <b>private</b> <b>box</b> of my primordial egg, saw what was going on." [...] Cal's dubious omniscience, doubtful narration, and parodies combine to show that his unreliability is an act of mischief.|$|E

He is greeted by the artists and staff ("Welcome Sir, I'm So Delighted"). The previous managers of the Paris Opera did not last very long, due to problems with {{the legend of the}} Opera Ghost, who demands 20,000 francs a month and his own <b>private</b> <b>box.</b> These requests are defied by the adamant and foolish Richard, little knowing the mayhem that will take place if he refuses to accept the Ghost's demands.

2500|$|After 1788 however we do {{not hear}} of a public {{performance}} until Braham appeared at Bath {{under the aegis of}} his teacher, the male soprano Venanzio Rauzzini in 1794. This empty period will have coincided with the departure of Leoni and also with Braham's voice breaking. It also therefore suggests a birthdate of around 1774 or 1775, rather than the 1777 date given by nearly all modern sources. During this period he was supported by the Goldsmid family. The Goldsmids were influential financiers who maintained their friendship with Braham later in his career and also used him as entertainment at their soirées. Their neighbour and occasional guest there was Horatio Nelson, whose heroic fate was later to prompt Braham's greatest song-writing success, [...] "The Death of Nelson". (It first appeared in the opera The Americans, (Lyceum Theatre, 1811). Lady Hamilton, who was in a <b>private</b> <b>box</b> for the performance, was reported to have been so overcome that she suffered a fit of hysterics and had to leave the theatre).|$|E
2500|$|On 16 October 2009, a {{competition}} called the [...] "Up to Now Pub Quiz" [...] was launched on Facebook. Fans {{were required to}} create teams of five, and were posed with ten questions, related to the band's entire career, each week. The team with the most correct answers at the end will fly to London {{to see one of}} the concerts at the Royal Albert Hall, with a certain part of travel cost paid. The team will be allotted their own <b>private</b> <b>box</b> at the venue, and will get a chance to meet the band afterward. Along the same lines, a Swiss radio station 20 Minuten hosted a similar competition for listeners. They had a pair of tickets for the concert for the Royal Albert Hall concert of 24 November to give away. All flight and hotel accommodation costs were paid for by the radio station. UK radio station Xfm organized {{a competition}} called [...] "Xfm's Snow Patrol Bad Photoshop Challenge", with ten pairs of tickets were up to win. These tickets would enable fans to see the band rehearse in a yet-unnamed location in Brighton at the eve of the Reworked Tour. The challenge was to associate five photoshopped pictures with Snow Patrol song titles. The competition will end on 10 November 2009. A further fifteen pairs of tickets will be given away on air. Tickets for the intimate acoustic show in London for the promotion of Up to Now could only be obtained via two competitions, one organized on Play.com and the other on the band's official website. Both involved answering a simple question. For the HMV singing and performance, wristbands were available from 9am on 3 December 2009. One band was assigned to one person, however, it was not necessary to have one to see the band perform. The bands were required only {{to gain access to the}} signing. Tickets for the mini-festival at Ward Park will go on pre-sale on 9 December 2009, and on general sale on the 11th, priced at £44.|$|E
