In Ewell the springs which form the Hogsmill River are evident, those in Epsom less so. The springs attracted prehistoric people and remains have been found, mostly in Ewell and particularly near the Hogsmill. In Roman times the road now known as Stane Street, from London to Chichester, passed through Epsom and Ewell. Roman remains have been found in Ewell suggesting a sizeable settlement. Epsom and Ewell have Saxon names: Ewell takes its name from the spring in the centre of the town and Epsom, or Ebbisham, is the enclosure of Ebbi. A Saxon cemetery in The Grove in Ewell was excavated in the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Locust Trace AgriScience Center, an agricultural-based {{vocational}} school serving Fayette County Public Schools and surrounding districts, features a Net Zero Academic Building engineered by CMTA Consulting Engineers and designed by Tate Hill Jacobs Architects. The facility, located in Lexington, Kentucky, {{also has a}} greenhouse, riding arena with stalls, and a barn. To reach Net Zero in the Academic Building the project utilizes an air-tight envelope, expanded indoor temperature setpoints in specified areas to more closely model real-world conditions, a solar thermal system, and geothermal water source heat pumps. The school has further reduced its site impact by minimizing municipal water use {{through the use of}} a dual system consisting of a standard leach field system and a constructed wetlands system and using <b>pervious</b> surfaces to collect, drain, and use rainwater for crop irrigation and animal watering.|$|E
25|$|Concrete {{roads are}} more fuel {{efficient}} to drive on, more reflective and last significantly longer than other paving surfaces, {{yet have a}} much smaller market share than other paving solutions. Modern-paving methods and design practices have changed the economics of concrete paving, so that a well-designed and placed concrete pavement will be less expensive on initial costs and significantly less expensive over the life cycle. Another major benefit is that <b>pervious</b> concrete can be used, which eliminates the need to place storm drains near the road, and reducing the need for slightly sloped roadway to help rainwater to run off. No longer requiring discarding rainwater through use of drains also means that less electricity is needed (more pumping is otherwise needed in the water-distribution system), and no rainwater gets polluted as it no longer mixes with polluted water. Rather, it is immediately absorbed by the ground.|$|E
25|$|Because Sonoma Creek is {{the sole}} {{drainage}} flow of the Sonoma Valley Wine Country, it is a vital resource for aquifer recharge. Proportionally a greater percent of Sonoma Creek feeds recharge than its neighbors, the Napa and Petaluma Rivers. This outcome derives from the presence of <b>pervious</b> valley floor alluvial soils and the gentle stream gradients along the valley floor, {{where most of the}} reaches occur. The valley itself is part of the Franciscan Complex, which includes crumpled, uplifted terranes that have resulted from the subduction of the former oceanic Farallon Plate under the North American continent. The area is attended by volcanism and sediments, deposited in the lagoons behind its island arcs, which resulted from geological events dating from 140to 42million years. Recharge for the Sonoma Valley is critical because local rainfall is only about 29inches (74centimeters) per year. Grape growing and wine production require considerable groundwater extraction, and there is controversy over wineries use of annual creeks and waterways.|$|E
25|$|Porous paving (or <b>pervious</b> paving) is an {{alternative}} to conventional impermeable pavement and allows infiltration of runoff water to the soil or to a dedicated water storage reservoir below it In reasonably flat areas such as car parks, driveways and lightly used roads, it decreases the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff and can improve water quality by removing contaminants through filtering, interception and biological treatment. Porous pavements can have several forms and are either monolithic or modular. Monolithic structures consist of a single continuous porous medium such as porous concrete or porous pavement (asphalt) while modular structures include porous pavers individual paving blocks that are constructed {{so that there is}} a gap in between each paver. Commercial products that are available are for example, pavements made from special asphalt or concrete containing minimal materials, concrete grid pavements, and concrete ceramic or plastic modular pavements. Porous pavements are usually laid on a very porous material (sand or gravel), underlain by a layer of geotextile material. Maintenance activities vary {{depending on the type of}} porous pavement. Generally, inspections and removal of sediment and debris should be undertaken. Modulate pavers can also be lifted, backwashed and replaced when blockages occurs. Generally porous pavement is not suited for areas with heavy traffic loads. Particulates in stormwater can clog pores in the material.|$|E

A two-story stucco archway spans the driveway and the home features intricate stucco work, as well as stone and tile in California Arts and Crafts movement style built to resemble de Lemos family's castle in Spain. The hacienda was constructed between 1931-41 by de Lemos.

2500|$|... (Original {{description}} by M. Schepman) The conical, scalar, umbilicate, whitish {{shell is}} moderately large for the genus with {{a height of}} 4.5mm, [...] It contains seven whorls. The nucleus is wanting. The upper whorls are eroded, the lower ones each contain three spiral lirae, of which the upper one runs at a little distance from the shallow but distinct suture, which is slightly undulate. From the first liration to the second, the shell is slightly convex, this latter liration is strong, prominent and divides the whorls in two subequal parts. Below this liration the shell is concave towards the basal or peripheral liration, which in the upper whorls, runs just in the suture {{and in the last}} one borders the basal surface. These lirations are slightly spinous. Distinct undulating plications run {{from one to the other}} of the lower lirae, with the convex side towards the aperture On the upper part they are directed in an opposite way, being less distinct about halfway the interspace between the upper and median liration. Moreover, the whole shell is covered with much weaker striae, having the character of growth striae and traces of more remote spiral striae. The basal face of the shell is subconvex, but quite flat in the centre, with a shallow groove between the peripheral keel and the first of the basal lirae, this space is rather smooth, though crossed by plicae running from the peripheral spipes in an oblique direction. The outermost of the basal lirae, which is not broad, is followed by two similar ones, about as strong as their interstices, the central ones, five in number, increasing in breadth towards the centre, (one of them nearly double) being larger than the interstices These lirae are connected by small radiating riblets in the interstices. The umbilicus is bordered by a liration, consisting of a row of subquadrate beads This umbilicus is <b>pervious</b> and funnel-shaped. Its wall is radiately striated and has one faint spiral rib. The aperture is rounded-subquadrate. Its right margin is incomplete, its columellar margin is curved, with a denticle in the basal part. It is slightly reflected over the umbilicus. The interior of the shell is nacreous, (the nacreous texture of the inner layers is clearly visible on some of the exterior ...|$|E

60|$|I {{must not}} here omit to take notice, {{that in this}} body {{there is not a}} {{vegetative}} faculty that should so contrive this structure for any peculiar use of vegetation or growth, whereas in the other instances of vegetable porous bodies, there is an anima or forma informans, that does contrive all the Structures and Mechanismes of the constituting body, to make them subservient and usefull to the great Work or Function they are to perform. And so I ghess the pores in Wood, and other vegetables, in bones, and other Animal substances, to be as so many channels, provided by the Great and Alwise Creator, for the conveyance of appropriated juyces to particular parts. And therefore, that this may tend, or be <b>pervious</b> all towards one part, and may have impediments, as valves or the like, to any other; but in this body we have very little reason so suspect there should be any such design, for it is equally <b>pervious</b> every way, not onely forward, but backwards, and side-ways, and seems indeed much rather to be Homogeneous or similar to those pores, which we may with great probability believe to be the channels of pellucid bodies, not directed, or more open any one way, then any other, being equally <b>pervious</b> every way.

The skins, and bones, and other trophies, he sent home in various ships; and when he appeared in London as a lion, no man doubted his word.

The city of Venice was not, it appeared, rich enough to repair the damage that winter; and buckets were set on the floor of the upper room of the school to catch the rain, which not only fell directly through the shot holes, but found its way, owing to the generally <b>pervious</b> state of the roof, through many of the canvases of Tintoret's in other parts of the ceiling.|$|E

What wife ever ceased to respect her husband because he dealt dishonestly in business? Whereas, let him not go to church, let him drink too much wine, let him go astray in his conversation, and her wrath arises against these faults.
