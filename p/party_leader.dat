40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{internal}} cohesion of government parties impacts the magnitude of budget deficits. Cohesion {{is a function of}} 1) who selects <b>party</b> <b>leaders,</b> and 2) who nominates election candidates. Where <b>party</b> <b>leaders</b> are picked by MPs, who in turn are chosen by the constituency party organization, legislators have stronger incentives to distribute private goods and can resist attempts by <b>party</b> <b>leaders</b> to restrain spending. However, where <b>party</b> <b>leaders</b> are responsible to a broader party selectorate AND have exclusive power to nominate election candidates, parties are much better at curbing common pool resource problems that generate higher government deficits. Based on an original dataset of party cohesion, covering 120 political parties in 17 OECD countries (1960 - 1990), I find that the balance of power between <b>party</b> <b>leaders</b> and rank-and-file MPs accounts for a greater proportion of government deficits than do the electoral system or cabinet composition...|$|R

5|$|Until about 1962, Khrushchev's {{position}} as <b>Party</b> <b>leader</b> was secure; {{but as the}} leader aged, he grew more erratic and his performance undermined the confidence of his fellow leaders. The Soviet Union's mounting economic problems also increased the pressure on Khrushchev's leadership. Outwardly, Brezhnev remained loyal to Khrushchev, but became involved in a 1963 plot to remove the leader from power, possibly playing a leading role. Also in 1963, Brezhnev succeeded Frol Kozlov, another Khrushchev protégé, as Secretary of the Central Committee, positioning him as Khrushchev's likely successor. Khrushchev made him Second Secretary, literally deputy <b>party</b> <b>leader,</b> in 1964.|$|E
5|$|After Høybråten {{announced}} that he would not seek reelection as <b>party</b> <b>leader</b> of KrF, Hareide quickly emerged as the leading candidate to succeed Høybråten, after the two other apparent candidates, Dagrun Eriksen and Hans Olav Syversen, announced they would not run. Hareide is considered to belong to the socially liberal wing of the party, and conservative members of the party have demanded {{that at least one of}} the deputy leaders be from the party's conservative wing if they are to support Hareide. Hareide supported the efforts to eliminate the rule which requires Christian Democratic party representatives to declare a Christian faith, and a vote gave a clear majority to abolish that rule two years later. Hareide was unanimously voted in as new <b>party</b> <b>leader</b> at the 2011 convention on 30 April 2011. Hareide declined the nomination as parliamentary leader, and Hans Olav Syversen was elected to this position.|$|E
