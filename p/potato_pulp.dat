40|$|In our {{previous}} study, we demonstrated that retrograded starch, {{a kind of}} resistant starch, of beans reduced serum lipid levels in rats. In this study, we examined whether retrograded starch in <b>potato</b> <b>pulps</b> could reduce serum lipid concentrations. Rats were given diets containing 15 g of retrograded starch in <b>potato</b> <b>pulps</b> from the Benimaru potato (BM) or Hokkaikogane potato (HK) in a 100 g diet for 4 wk. At the 4 th week, the total cholesterol level in the serum in the BM group and serum triglyceride (TG) level in the HK group were significantly lower {{than those in the}} control group. In the BM group, the contents of fecal bile acids were significantly higher than those in the control group. On the other hand, in the HK group, the hepatic mRNA level of fatty acid synthase (FAS) was significantly lower than that in the control group. The FAS mRNA level correlated with the mRNA level of sterol regulatory element-binding protein- 1 c (SREBP- 1 c), a regulator of expression of FAS, positively. These results suggested that BM pulp promoted the excretion of bile acids, which resulted in a low concentration of serum cholesterol. On the other hand, HK pulp inhibited the synthesis of fatty acids at the mRNA levels of FAS and SREBP- 1 c, which might lead to a reduction of the serum TG level. 日本ビタミン学会、日本栄養・食糧学会共同編集[URL]...|$|R

Material and methods. Sterilised <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> was subjected to hydrolysis with commercial enzymatic preparations. The effectiveness of the preparations declared as active towards only one fraction of <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> (separate amylase, pectinase and cellulase activity) and mixtures of these preparations was analysed.

40|$|Two {{in vitro}} {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to quantify the incorporation of nitrogen (N) by pig colonic bacteria during the fermentation of dietary fibre, including non-starch polysaccharides and resistant starch. In the first experiment, five purified carbohydrates were used: starch (S), cellulose (C), inulin (I), pectin (P) and xylan (X). In the second experiment, three pepsin–pancreatin hydrolysed ingredients were investigated: <b>potato,</b> sugar-beet <b>pulp</b> and wheat bran. The substrates were incubated in an inoculum, prepared from fresh faeces of sows and a buffer solution providing 15 N-labelled NH 4 Cl. Gas production was monitored. Bacterial N incorporation (BNI) was estimated by measuring the incorporation of 15 N in the solid residue at halftime to asymptotic gas production (T/ 2). The remaining substrate was analysed for sugar content. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were determined in the liquid phase. In the first experiment, the fermentation kinetics differed between the substrates. P, S and I showed higher rates of degradation (P, 0. 001), while X and C showed a longer lag time and T/ 2. The sugar disappearance reached 0. 91, 0. 90, 0. 81, 0. 56 and 0. 46, respectively, for P, I, S, C and X. Among them, S and I fixed more N per gram substrate (P, 0. 05) than C, X and P (22. 9 and 23. 2 mg fixed N per gram fermented substrate v. 11. 3, 12. 3 and 9. 8, respectively). Production of SCFA was the highest for the substrates with low N fixation: 562 and 565 mg/g fermented substrate for X and C v. 290 to 451 for P, I and S (P, 0. 01). In the second experiment, <b>potato</b> and sugar-beet <b>pulp</b> fermented more rapidly than wheat bran (P, 0. 001). Substrate disappearance at T/ 2 varied from 0. 17 to 0. 50. BNI were 18. 3, 17. 0 and 10. 2 fixed N per gram fermented substrate, for sugar-beet <b>pulp,</b> <b>potato</b> and wheat bran, respectively, but were not statistically different. SCFA productions were the highest with wheat bran (913 mg/g fermented substrate) followed by sugar-beet <b>pulp</b> (641) and <b>potato</b> (556) (P, 0. 05). The differences in N uptake by intestinal bacteria {{are linked to the}} partitioning of the substrate energy content between bacterial growth and SCFA production.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and ancient roots of Brazil and it can be {{consumed}} at different forms such as boiled, roasted or as sweets. Its cooking can lead to physicochemical transformations altering the nutritional properties. The objective of this study was to evaluate the physicochemical characteristics, bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity of twelve sweet potato genotypes of varying pulp color in natura and roasted. Soluble solids, acidity, sugars, carotenoids, anthocyanins, phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity were analyzed in the following sweet <b>potatoes</b> genotypes: cream <b>pulp</b> (Rubissol, Cuia, ILS 03, ILS 10, ILS 12, ILS 24 and ILS 44); orange pulp (Amelia and Beauregard); and purple pulp (ILS 56, ILS 16 and ILS 71). According to the results, it was observed a wide variation among the sweet potato genotypes for all analyzed parameters, in both preparation forms. The antioxidant capacity was a parameter with wide variation among genotypes, 210. 29 to 7870. 57 µg trolox equivalent/g in in natura form and 673. 26 to 17306. 22 µg trolox equivalent/g in roasted form. Soluble solids, acidity, sugars and bioactive compounds, with the exception of carotenoids, tended to be concentrated, also increases the total antioxidant capacity, in roasted sweet potatoes. In conclusion, genotype and the color of sweet potatoes were parameters that had an influence on its chemical composition.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{relation}} between emission of methane (CH 4) and faecal and urinary losses of nitrogen (N) in dairy cattle, various dietary strategies were evaluated using a mechanistic model of fermentation and digestion processes. To simulate faecal and urinary composition, an extant dynamic, mechanistic model of rumen function and post-absorptive nutrient supply was extended with static equations that describe intestinal digestion and hindgut fermentation. The extended model predicts organic matter, carbon and N output in faeces and urine. Methane emissions were simulated using the same model including a mechanistic description of methanogenesis in the rumen and in the hindgut. Four different types of grass silage were explored at high and low N fertilization levels and early or late cutting. For each grass silage, 10 supplementation strategies that differed in level and type of supplement (no supplement, maize silage, straw, beet <b>pulp,</b> <b>potatoes)</b> and level of concentrate (20 or 40 % of total diet DM) were studied. Simulated total N and CH 4 excretion ranged from 211 to 588 g/d and 334 to 441 g/d, respectively, with a small, positive correlation (r 2 = 0. 15). When expressed per unit fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM), a reduced N excretion (g N/kg FPCM) was associated with increased CH 4 emission (g CH 4 / kg FPCM) although the coefficient of determination was small (r 2 = 0. 22). This relationship varied between different treatments. For example, reducing N fertilization level lowered N excretion per kg FPCM, but increased CH 4 emission per kg FPCM, whereas supplementation with maize silage reduced both N excretion and CH 4 emission per kg FPCM. The ratio of urea-N in urine to total N excretion was negatively related to emission of CH 4 per kg FPCM (r 2 = 0. 54). This is of particular concern since urea in the urine, being quickly converted to ammonia, is susceptible to rapid volatilization. The present simulations indicate that measures to reduce N pollution from dairy cattle may increase CH 4 emission and highlight an important area for experimental research...|$|R

The whole system was controlled and operated by a programmable logic controller and process personal computer system. The system was able to process 12 potato samples per hour. Measurements were done to establish the sample carry-over in the system. The carry-over was proven to be well below the maximum acceptable level of 2 %. The UWW values established with the automatic system corresponded very well with the UWW data obtained by manual weighting. The day-to-day reproducibility of the UWW system was tested with golf balls. These balls have about the same specific gravity and size as potatoes. The day-to-day reproducibility coefficient of variation of the UWW unit was 0. 4 %. As a principle of proof, two tentative partial least squares calibration models, one for the starch concentration {{and one for the}} coagulating protein concentration in the potato samples, were calculated, applying leaving one out cross-validation. Both models were very promising. The by NIR-predicted starch concentrations showed to be at least as good or even better than the by UWW-obtained starch concentrations.

The relationships between pectin structure and fermentation behaviour were investigated using such systems. Fractions derived from smooth regions (polygalacturonic acid, oligogalacturonides DPS and DP 9, methylated citrus pectin and methylated oligogalacturonides), and hairy regions of pectins (oligorhamnogalacturonides, arabinan, oligoarabinosides, galactan and oligogalactosides), together with inulin as a positive prebiotic control, were fermented by human faecal bacteria. Changes in principal gut microbiota components were determined. Bacteroides/Prevotella increased on all substrates tested apart from oligogalacturonides of DPS. Fractions exhibiting a bifidogenic effect were galactan and arabinan type oligosaccharides which were comparable to inulin. To assess whether the arabinose and galactose contents of pectin determined the prebiotic potential of pectin, in vitro batch fermenters of galactose rich (70. 6 mole% galactose) and arabinose rich (63. 7 mole% arabinose) rhamnogalacturonan type I from <b>potato</b> and apple <b>pulp</b> were carried out and compared with galacturonic acid which was rich in pectins (citrus pectin and polygalacturonic acid). The bifidogenic effect was highest with rhamnogalacturonan type I fractions rich in arabinose and galactose as predicted by above the structure function relationships. Pectins (paS 1, pas 2 and pas TC} were also assessed for their prebiotic potential through in vitro batch fermentation. Methylated homogalacturonan was the major component of pas 1 and pas TC, pas 2 carried 33. 7 % w/w arabinose and exhibited the highest arabinose content among the three pass. Bifidobacterial numbers increased with all substrates tested and inulin demonstrated the highest stimulation. Among pass, pas 2 showed the strongest bifidogenic effect which was related to its high arabinose content. pas 2 and inulin resulted in an increase in lactobacilli/enterococci. pass did not show cytotoxicity nor any effect on viability of Caco 2 cells following incubation with 0. 1 - 10. 0 mg/ml for 24 h. No DNA laddering, as a presumptive indicator of apoptosis, was seen after treating cells with 10 mg/ml pas 1, pas 2 and pas TC for 72 h. In general, pectin has prebiotic potential.

A high content of insoluble pectin and a high perceived crispiness/graininess was found in suspensions with a microstructure consisting of large cell clusters and aggregates (carrot and <b>potato</b> <b>pulp).</b> The micro¬structure of these suspensions is degraded to smaller clusters by homo¬genisation, but retains their original cellular shape. However, suspensions with a microstructure consisting of single cells and cell fragments (tomato and apple), were more easily degraded by homogenisation, and contained lower amounts of insoluble pectin. The latter type of microstructure exhibited a higher WHC, elastic modulus and sensory perceived melting and slipperiness. The main effect of heat treatment was on the solubility of the dietary fibre. In carrot and apple suspensions where β-elimination was favoured by heating, an increase was seen in the amount of soluble pectin together with a decrease in the mean particle size of the insoluble fibre. With the decrease in the insoluble material, a significant decrease in the WHC was seen for both apple and carrot. Heat-treated <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> suspensions were affected differently, since starch remaining in the matrix started to swell, which led to a difference in the particle size distribution and morphology. There was also a significant increase in WHC with heating, probably resulting from the swelling of the starch. Low-fat sausages containing <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> exhibited greater firmness than the sausage without any fibre, according to a compression test. It is suggested that the high content of insoluble fibre in the <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> forms a strong fibrous network in the meat protein network of the sausages, thereby increasing the firmness...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the studies}} was to {{determine}} the effects of media with composts, based on sewage sludge and <b>potato</b> <b>pulp,</b> on the growth and conformation of the cultivar 'Butterfl y Yellow with Blotch'. In the experiment 14 potting media, including 12 media made of 4 composts, were tested. The percentage of compost mixed with sphagnum peat was 25 %, 50 % and 75 %. The components of particular composts were as follows: I - municipal sewage sludge 70 % and straw 30 %; II - municipal sewage sludge 70 % and sawdust 30 %; III - municipal sewage sludge 35 %, <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> 35 % and straw 30 %; IV - municipal sewage sludge 35 %, <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> 35 % and sawdust 30 %. Two control potting media were used: 1 - sphagnum peat with Osmocote Exact Lo-Start at the dose 5 g×dm - 3, and 2 - sphagnum peat with Azofoska at the dose 2. 5 g×dm - 3. There was no top-dressing during cultivation. The potting media used for pansy cultivation were rich in essential nutrients and in certain media macroelement content exceeded the limits recommended for the species with great nutrient requirements. The effects of the media on the growth, conformation and foliage of pansies depended on compost composition and its pecentage in a medium. The composts used for the media were found to be suitable for pansy cultivation. Despite smaller leaf rosettes in comparison with control plants, the pansies from compost media grew well and showed no disease symptoms...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the studies was to {{determine}} the effects of media containing composts from sewage sludge and <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> on the flowering and decorative value of 'Butterfly Yellow with Blotch' parviflorous pansy. In the experiment 14 potting media, including 12 media made of 4 composts, were tested. The percentage of compost mixed with sphagnum peat was 25 %, 50 % and 75 %. The components of particular composts were as follows: I - municipal sewage sludge 70 % and straw 30 %; II - municipal sewage sludge 70 % and sawdust 30 %; III - municipal sewage sludge 35 %, <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> 35 % and straw 30 %; IV - municipal sewage sludge 35 %, <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> 35 % and sawdust 30 %. Two control potting media were used: 1 - sphagnum peat with Osmocote Exact Lo-Start at the dose 5 g×dm - 3 and 2 - sphagnum peat with Azofoska at the dose 2. 5 g×dm - 3. There was no top-dressing during cultivation. The pansies for whose cultivation a slow-release fertiliser was used turned out to have most flowers, but the plants cultivated in compost with peat at the ratio 1 : 1 had equally abundant flowering. At the generative stage, the pansies in control media were the most decorative and those growing in 25 % of compost I, 75 % of compost II and 50 % of compost III and IV. On the basis of plant valuation scale, quality assessment and the abundance of flowering it was found that the media containing 50 % of composts were optimal for pansy cultivation...|$|E
40|$|The pectin {{content in}} the soluble and {{insoluble}} fractions of fiber suspensions from carrot, <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> and apple heat treated in four different ways was determined together with the particle size distribution, water-holding capacity (WHC), morphology and rheological properties of the fiber suspensions. In the carrot and apple suspensions, where beta-elimination was favored, the soluble pectin increased, whereas a significant but small decrease of the mean particle size of the insoluble material was obtained together with {{a significant decrease in}} WHC. For the <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> suspensions, however, only minor pectin solubilization was observed by heat treatment. Instead remaining starch in the cell matrix swelled on prolonged heating, leading to a different particle size distribution and a significant increase in WHC However, only minor effects on heating were seen on the elastic modulus for all fiber sources studied. But the source of fiber seems to be more important for the elastic modulus of the suspension, where the order of firmness in heated tissues (not the suspensions) seems to be the determining factor, being in the order of apple > potato > carrot...|$|E

Experiments were conducted in the years 2005 – 2007. Six horned violet cultivars (Viola cornuta  L.) from Patiola F 1 group and four substrates were used in them: I – sphagnum peat; II – substrate from peat and compost 1 (1 : 1 v/v); III – substrate from peat and compost 2 (1 : 1 v/v); IV – coconut fibre. Compost 1 was prepared using municipal sewage sludge (35 %), <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> (35 %) and straw (30 %). Compost 2 was prepared using municipal sewage sludge (35 %), <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> (35 %) and sawdust (30 %). Composts after 10 months of composting were used in the research. The addition of municipal sewage sludge composts did not cause observable adverse changes in plants grown. Composts made from municipal sewage sludge are rich in nutrients. Plants that are grown in substrates with the addition of composts and in a peat substrate grow and develop properly without the necessity of introducing top dressing...|$|E

40|$|An {{off-line}} near-infrared reflectance (NIR) {{feasibility study}} was conducted to explore the critical steps in the NIR determination of the major potato constituents (dry matter, starch, and protein) in relatively large (10 kg) potato samples. The results were important for the design of an automated industrial analysis system for potatoes with in-line NIR. The 10 -kg potato samples were pulped with an industrial rotary saw blade rasp. A critical step in the NIR measurements was the occurrence of phase separation in the <b>potato</b> <b>pulp.</b> Phase separation manifests itself directly after pulping the potatoes and significantly affects the NIR spectrum. Therefore, during the NIR measurements, the <b>potato</b> <b>pulp</b> had to be stirred continuously. The NIR spectra (1, 100 - 2, 500 nm) were measured by applying an optical fiber NIR probe (EDAPT- 1) connected to the NIR spectrophotometer (Technicon Infralyzer IA 500). NIR models for the concentration of dry matter, starch, and coagulating protein in potatoes have been developed. With the partial least squares regression procedure, promising NIR models were calculated. The NIR models were validated using an independent validation set of potato samples. The root mean square error in prediction of the samples in the validation set was 0. 5 % (w/w) for dry matter, 0. 63 (w/w) for starch concentration, and 0. 06 % (w/w) for the coagulating protein. © 2010 EAPR...|$|E
