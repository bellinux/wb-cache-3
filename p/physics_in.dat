5|$|After he was honorably {{discharged}} in 1946, O'Neill {{studied for}} an undergraduate degree in physics and mathematics at Swarthmore College. As a child he had discussed {{the possibilities of}} humans in space with his parents, and in college he enjoyed working on rocket equations. However, {{he did not see}} space science as an option for a career path in physics, choosing instead to pursue high-energy <b>physics.</b> <b>In</b> 1950 he graduated with Phi Beta Kappa honors. O'Neill performed his graduate studies at Cornell University {{with the help of an}} Atomic Energy Commission fellowship, and was awarded a Ph.D. in <b>physics</b> <b>in</b> 1954.|$|E
5|$|Burhop won a scholarship, {{and entered}} the University of Melbourne in 1928. He {{initially}} studied civil engineering, but switched to science after two years, and majored in <b>physics.</b> <b>In</b> 1929, he was awarded a bursary that provided financial assistance. He graduated in 1931 with a bachelor of science BSc degree with first class honours in physics. He then earned a Bachelor of Arts (BA), also with first class honours, in mathematics in 1932, and a master of science in <b>physics</b> <b>in</b> 1933.|$|E
5|$|At least 25 laureates have {{received}} the Nobel Prize for contributions {{in the field of}} organic chemistry, more than any other field of chemistry. Two Nobel Prize laureates in Chemistry, Germans Richard Kuhn (1938) and Adolf Butenandt (1939), were not allowed by their government to accept the prize. They would later receive a medal and diploma, but not the money. Frederick Sanger is one out of two laureates to be awarded the Nobel prize twice in the same subject, in 1958 and 1980. John Bardeen is the other and was awarded the Nobel Prize in <b>physics</b> <b>in</b> 1956 and 1972. Two others have won Nobel Prizes twice, one in chemistry and one in another subject: Maria Skłodowska-Curie (<b>physics</b> <b>in</b> 1903, chemistry in 1911) and Linus Pauling (chemistry in 1954, peace in 1962). As of 2017, the prize has been awarded to 177 individuals, including four women: Maria Skłodowska-Curie, Irène Joliot-Curie (1935), Dorothy Hodgkin (1964), and Ada Yonath (2009). There have been eight years in which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was not awarded.|$|E

5|$|Conditions {{improved}} slightly {{after the}} death of Peter II, and Euler swiftly rose through the ranks in the academy and was made a professor of <b>physics</b> <b>in</b> 1731. Two years later, Daniel Bernoulli, who was fed up with the censorship and hostility he faced at Saint Petersburg, left for Basel. Euler succeeded him {{as the head of the}} mathematics department.|$|E
