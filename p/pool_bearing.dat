60|$|In the meantime, Kit and Cayman's {{crew were}} strenuously occupied. After they had landed the ballast, cable and all heavy stores, they took careful {{soundings}} {{in the boat}} and marked the best line to the <b>pool</b> by <b>bearings</b> from the shore. Then, when the moon was new and high water at about twelve o'clock one hot morning they launched the boat. For about two hours there would be water enough to float Cayman across the highest sands, but {{if she did not}} reach the pool before the tide ebbed much she would strike and stop for good. Since the ballast was landed, sail could not be used and she must, if possible, be towed by the boat. Kit, however, doubted. There was some wind and towing would be hard. He thought they would soon be forced to kedge; to carry out a small anchor and heave the vessel forward by the rope. Perhaps the worst was the sun was nearly overhead.|$|R

Using pulse-chase experiments in combination with subcellular fractionation, we have observed that the sequestration of high-mannose glycoproteins in lysosomes was impaired by drugs which interfere with the autophagic-lysosomal pathway. The accumulation of high-mannose glycoproteins in the lysosomal fraction was shown {{to be part of}} the general autophagic pathway constitutively expressed in undifferentiated cells, as independently measured by the sequestration of the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase and electroloaded raffinose. Furthermore, when HT- 29 cells were cultured under differentiation-permissive conditions, the decreased accumulation of high-mannose glycoproteins in the lysosomal compartment was correlated with the decrease in autophagy...|$|R

The two monocarbonyl species fac-[Ru(CO) (dmso-O) 3 (dmso-S) 2][PF 6] 2 (11) and cis,cis,cis-[RuCl(CO) (dmso-O) 2 (dmso-S) 2][PF 6] (12) {{were obtained from}} the neutral monocarbonyl precursor cis,trans,cis-[RuCl 2 (CO) (dmso-O) (dmso-S) 2] (3) upon stepwise replacement of the chlorides with dmso, that binds in each case through the oxygen atom. The dicarbonyl cationic complex cis,cis,trans-[Ru(CO) 2 (dmso-O) 2 (dmso-S) Cl][PF 6] (13) was instead obtained upon treatment of the neutral tricarbonyl precursor fac-[RuCl 2 (CO) 3 (dmso-O) ] (8) with AgPF 6 in the presence of DMSO: replacement of a Cl− with a dmso-O impliedalso the substitution of one CO ligand by another dmso (that binds through S trans to Cl). The Os(II) carbonyls trans,trans,trans-[OsCl 2 (CO) (dmso-O) (dmso-S) 2] (17), trans,cis,cis-[OsCl 2 (CO) 2 (dmso-O) 2] (18), cis,mer-[OsCl 2 (CO) (dmso-S) 3] (19), and cis,trans,cis-[OsCl 2 (CO) (dmso-O) (dmso-S) 2] (20) were obtained by treatment of the Os(II) -dmso precursors trans-[OsCl 2 (dmso-S) 4] (14) and cis,fac-[OsCl 2 (dmso-O) (dmso-S) 3] (15) with CO. Each one of them is structurally similar to an already known Ru(II) analog, even though - in agreement with the expected greater inertness of Os(II) - more forcing reaction conditions were required for their preparation. Interestingly, compound 20 could not be isolated in pure form, but only as a 1 : 1 cocrystallized mixture with its precursor 15. The dmso ligand is always bound through the oxygen atom when trans to CO. We are con ﬁ dent that the new Ru(II) - and Os(II) -dmso carbonyl species described here represent a contribution to expand the <b>pool</b> of complexes <b>bearing</b> some easily replaceable dmso ligands to be used as well-behaved precursors in inorganic synthesis...|$|R

The women had to cook corn and eggs the {{traditional}} Māori way, by lowering baskets full of them from a height into hot springs down below. For each dollar they made selling eggs and corn to locals, they would win $100 for the group kitty, at a maximum of $25,000. They were given an hour. The money, however, was locked in a safe, {{and two of them}} had to search through a mud <b>pool</b> for dogtags <b>bearing</b> the combination to the safe. Heidi and Liane cooked the foodand made $172, which the host rounded up to $18,000 potential winnings. Liz and Kristy searched the mud pool for the dogtags and found only two of them, the first two digits to the four-digit safe combination, which were both 6. They delivered the two dogtags to Liane and Heidi and kept looking, but before they found the third dogtag, Liz figured out that the combination would be the word MOLE on a telephone keypad, 6653, since that was borne out by the first two digits both being 6. As they raced to Liane and Heidis position, the other two tried two unsuccessful combinations before hearing the solution. The safe would lock for three minutes after a third incorrect guess, and their time ticked under three minutes as Liane and Heidi waited for Liz and Kristy to get close enough to them to tell them the solution. When she saw the safes keypad, Liz told Heidi to key in 6642, since the number 1 on the safe had the letters A, B, and C where on a telephone it has no letters. This guess was incorrect, and they did not have time to try again. The host revealed, when the time ran out, that 6653 was indeed the correct combination.|$|R
40|$|Many filed {{inspections}} and steel bridge surveys report that steel plate girder bridges {{are more susceptible}} to corrode at the end due to the accumulation of the water at bearing region. This water <b>pools</b> at the <b>bearing</b> is the result of rain shower and water leakage from the construction joints, which cause the corrosion of bearing stiffener and nearby web. The statistical data shows that only in Japan in more than 70 % corroded steel bridges, corrosion was found near the girder ends, which is primarily due to very aggressive environmental and severe topographical conditions of Japan (Chapter 2). Corrosion at plate girder ends damages the bearing stiffener and nearby web locally and in most of the cases rest of the girder part remains intact. Bearing stiffeners have a very important role in resisting the compressive load. Moreover, besides resisting the compressive load bearing stiffeners are also designed as anchor to balance the horizontal component of tension field action developed in the exterior web and resist the moment transferred by the in plane bending. Thus, any significant damage on bearing stiffener and nearby web may cause the buckling/crushing near the bearing and may also cause a significant loss in the bearing and shear capacity. Further, some field inspection data regarding the steel bridge damages was also collected from the Pakistan (Chapter 3) to assess the feasibility of required action to deal with these steel bridges. The inspection data also depicts the similar plate girder ends damages as reported in Japan. As number old of steel brides are increasing day by day in Japan and all around the world and {{it is very difficult to}} replace the all old brides at the same time along with the construction of the new bridges due to many constraints, i. e. economy of the country, traffic switching problem, lack of expertise and resources, manpower and machinery etc. Moreover, many bridges may have the adequate capacity to be used (Chapter 1). Therefore, all the corroded and old bridges demand the proper evaluation to assess their current performance level e. g. residual bearing and shear capacity so that suitable measure regarding the repair, retrofitting or replacement of these steel bridges can be adopted. The present study focusesiion the experimental and analytical evaluation of bearing and shear capacity of corroded bridges affected by the end panel corrosion. The chapter 4 discusses the experimental program conducted on the large scale plate girder ends specimens, simulated with local corrosion damage on the bearing stiffener. In all, total five plate girder end specimens were used. On one specimen no damage is considered and regarded as the healthy specimen and on the rest of two pair, 50 % thickness of the bearing stiffener is reduced within the damage height “Dh” of 20 mm and 60 mm uniformly and non-uniformly starting from the top face of the bottom flange near the weld seam. The study reported that 20 mm damage height does not change either the ultimate capacity or buckling failure mode. However, a relatively large damage of 60 mm shift the buckling of the stiffener within the damage zones along with the normal buckling within the normal web buckling. The chapter 5 deals with the extension of study to evaluate the bearing capacity of the plate girder ends analytically. For this purpose the test results obtained through the experimental program (conducted and mention in chapter 4) are modeled in a powerful finite element (FE) software ABAQUS. The comparison of the experimental and analytical results are made in term of the load-displacement relationships and deformed buckling modes and analytical results show the good agreement. Four various damage groups, Stiffener damage only, stiffener damage plus the free web end damage, stiffener damage plus interior web damage and stiffener damage plus the web damage at both side of the bearing stiffener were considered in the analytical program. Various residual thicknesses i. e. 75 %, 50 % and 25 etc. were assumed within the different damage heights zones. As the study is targeted to study the effect of the local damage, the maximum damage height is considered as 100 mm (10 % of girder height). True stress-strain relationships are determined by performing the tension test on the coupon cut from the used specimens with isotropic strain hardening rule are utilized in the analytical study. Initial deflections and welding residual stresses are also considered in the finite element (FE) study. Many trial analyses with different damage shapes and forms suggest that a simple uniform rectangular type of the damage with minimum thickness can be utilized in the FE simulation. Further, analytical results conclude that bearing stiffener has very important role in resisting the bearing load and any severe damage may reduce its radiusiiiof gyration along the week axis which may give rise to the stability problem by causing the buckling/ crippling failure at bearing. The results also revealed that the web damage alone does not affect the load carrying capacity significantly however; it reduces the load carrying capacity substantially when web damage is combined with the stiffener damage. The Chapter 6 describes the effect of local corrosion damages at the girder end on its shear capacity. An extensive analytical study is conducted on a four panel plate girder model and similar damage cases are assumed as considered (in Chapter 5) for the bearing capacity analysis. A mild steel with yield stresses equal to 345 Mpa with elastics perfectly plastics (EPP) characteristics under kinematics plasticity rule is used. A small initial out-of-plane deflection is also incorporated while; no residual stresses are considered in the study as they have no effect on the shear capacity. Analytical results indicate that a loss of the bearing stiffener more than 50 % can be fatal for the plate girder and it reduces the anchorage for the tension field action and thus refrains the girder to achieve its full post buckling strength. Also, complete loss of stiffener thickness shifts the failure mode of the girder from shear to buckling. The Chapter 7 comprises of some proposed empirical relationships to estimate ultimate capacity under the shear and compressive loads application. This section also discusses a proposed damage parameter named the “Reduced Thickness Ratio” to assess the buckling failure mode of the plate girder specimen under compressive loadFinally, Chapter 8 consists of a summary of conclusions and recommendations that are drawn from the above mentioned work. Subsequently some recommendations are also made for future research...|$|R
