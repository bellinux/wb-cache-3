40|$|While {{tuberculosis}} (TB) in Canadian {{cities is}} increasingly affecting foreign-born <b>persons,</b> <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> remain at high risk. To assess trends in TB, we studied all <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> in Toronto {{who had a}} diagnosis of active TB during 1998 – 2007. We compared Canada-born and foreign-born <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> and assessed changes over time. We identifi ed 91 <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> with active TB; they typically had highly contagious, advanced disease, and 19 % died within 12 months of diagnosis. The proportion of <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> who were foreign-born increased from 24 % in 1998 – 2002 to 39 % in 2003 – 2007. Among foreign-born <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> with TB, 56 % of infections were caused by strains not known to circulate among <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> in Toronto. Only 2 % of infections were resistant to fi rst-line TB medications. The rise in foreign-born <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> with TB strains likely acquired overseas suggests that the risk for drug-resistant strains entering the homeless shelter system may be escalating. In Canada’s major cities, tuberculosis (TB) is increasingly becoming a disease of persons born outside Canada (foreign-born). In 2009 {{in the city of}} Toronto in Ontario, 94 % of all persons with active TB were foreign-born (1). Although homeless and marginally housed persons represent a smaller proportion of TB case-patients, they remain a persistent high-risk population.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Homeless</b> <b>persons</b> face many {{barriers}} to health care, have few resources, and experience high death rates. They live lives of disenfranchisement and neglect. Few studies have explored {{their experiences and}} attitudes toward death and dying. Unfortunately, studies done in other populations may not apply to <b>homeless</b> <b>persons.</b> Exploring these experiences and attitudes may provide insight into life, health care, and end-of-life (EOL) concerns of this population. OBJECTIVE: To explore the experiences and attitudes toward death and dying among <b>homeless</b> <b>persons.</b> DESIGN: Qualitative study utilizing focus groups.

40|$|From contact {{investigation}} to tuberculosis screening of drug addicts and <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> in Rotterdam Gerard de Vries and Rob A. van Hest Background: In early 2001 there were indications that tuberculosis (TB) was increasingly becoming a problem among drug addicts and <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> in Rotterdam, after a periodical screening was discontinued in 1997. A contact investigation around a homeless drug addicted man in Rotterdam with infectious pulmonary TB is described. Contact investigation: A total of 507 drug addicts, <b>homeless</b> <b>persons,</b> and staff of facilities for these risk groups were examined with tuberculin skin testing (TST) and chest radiography. DNA fingerprinting of mycobacteriological cultures through Restricted Fragment Length Polymorphism methodology and molecular epidemiology investigation through cluster analysis were performed. Outcome: TST showed an infection prevalence of 29 %, especially among staff {{of services for}} drug addicts and <b>homeless</b> <b>persons.</b> Six persons with active intrathoracic TB were identified. Cluster analysis demonstrated no relation with the initial case but showed intense transmission of TB among drug addicts and <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> in Rotterdam bymultiple sources.

40|$|This review {{discusses}} {{nutrition and}} related health problems among homeless Americans, summarizes recent information, and identifies needs for services and future research. The nature of homelessness today provides {{a context for}} the discussion. Many <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> eat fewer meals per day, lack food more often, {{and are more likely}} to have inadequate diets and poorer nutritional status than housed U. S. populations. Yet many homeless people eligible for food stamps do not receive them. While public and private agencies provide nutritious food and meals for <b>homeless</b> <b>persons,</b> availability of the services to <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> is limited. Many homeless people lack appropriate health care, and certain nutrition-related health problems are prevalent among them. Compared with housed populations, alcoholism, anemia, and growth problems are more common among <b>homeless</b> <b>persons,</b> and pregnancy rates are higher. The risks vary among <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> for malnutrition, nutrition-related health problems, drug and alcohol abuse, and mental illness. For example, among <b>homeless</b> <b>persons,</b> fewer heads of families than single adults are substance abusers, and mental illness varies in prevalence among single men, single women, and parents in <b>homeless</b> families. <b>Homeless</b> <b>persons</b> need improved access to food, nutrition, and health services. More nutrition education needs to be available to them and to service providers. Use of representative samples and validation of self-reported nutrition and health data will help future investigators to clarify the relationships between the characteristics of the homeless and their nutritional status...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Tuberculosis (TB) is a {{major public}} health problem. The Airin {{district}} of Osaka City has a large population of <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> and caregivers and {{is estimated to be}} the largest TB-endemic area in the intermediate-prevalence country, Japan. However, there have been few studies of <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> and caregivers. The objective {{of this study is to}} detect active TB and to assess the prevalence and risk factors for latent TB infection among <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> and caregivers. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study for screening TB infection (active and latent TB infections) using questionnaire, chest X-ray (CXR), newly available assay for latent TB infection (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube; QFT) and clinical evaluation by physicians at the Osaka Socio-Medical Center Hospital between July 2007 and March 2008. <b>Homeless</b> <b>persons</b> and caregivers, aged 30 - 74 years old, who had not received CXR examination within one year, were recruited. As for risk factors of latent TB infection, the odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) for QFT-positivity were calculated using logistic regression model. Results Complete responses were available from 436 individuals (263 <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> and 173 caregivers). Four active TB cases (1. 5 %) among <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> were found, while there were no cases among caregivers. Out of these four, three had positive QFT results. One hundred and thirty-three (50. 6 %) <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> and 42 (24. 3 %) caregivers had positive QFT results. In multivariate analysis, QFT-positivity was independently associated with a long time spent in the Airin district: ≥ 10 years versus Conclusions Although no active TB was found for caregivers, one-quarter of them had latent TB infection. In addition to <b>homeless</b> <b>persons,</b> caregivers need examinations for latent TB infection as well as active TB and careful follow-up, especially when they have spent a long time in a TB-endemic area and/or have been exposed to TB patients. </p...|$|R

40|$|A <b>homeless</b> <b>person</b> may be owed {{a duty to}} be re-housed by a local housing {{authority}} if they can meet the requirements {{set out in the}} Housing Act 1996. The authority does not owe the full duty, however, in circumstances where the <b>homeless</b> <b>person</b> has made themselves ‘intentionally homeless’ - where they have carried out a deliberate act or omission which has led to their loss of accommodation. The House of Lords ruling in Din v Wandsworth London Borough Council [1983] had created a consistent and certain approach to findings of intentionality. The Supreme Court in Haile claims not to have departed from the reasoning in Din. Still, it will be shown that the express findings in Haile have completely changed the approach to intentionality. Despite the Supreme Court’s protestations to the contrary, a certain deliberate act by a <b>homeless</b> <b>person</b> can now be ignored if, hypothetically, the <b>homeless</b> <b>person</b> would have become homeless anyway – creating a causational nightmare for authority decision makers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Comorbid {{psychiatric}} illness can undermine outcomes among <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> undergoing addiction treatment, and psychiatric specialty {{care is not}} always readily available. The prognosis for nonsubstance abuse psychiatric diagnoses among <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> receiving behaviorally-based addiction treatment, however, is little studied. Results Data from an addiction treatment trial for 95 cocaine-dependent <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> (1996 – 1998) were used to profile psychiatric diagnoses at baseline and 6 months, including mood-related disorders (e. g. depression) and anxiety-related disorders (e. g. post-traumatic stress disorder). Treatment interventions, including systematic reinforcement for goal attainment, were behavioral in orientation. There was a 32 % reduction in the prevalence of comorbid non-addiction psychiatric disorder from baseline to 6 months, with similar reductions in the prevalence of mood (- 32 %) and anxiety-related disorders (- 20 %) (p = 0. 12). Conclusion Among cocaine-dependent <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> with psychiatric comorbidity undergoing behavioral addiction treatment, a reduction in comorbid psychiatric disorder prevalence was observed over 6 months. Not all participants improved, suggesting that even evidence-based addiction treatment will prove insufficient for a meaningful proportion of the dually diagnosed homeless population. </p...|$|R
