40|$|We {{develop a}} model of {{collective}} innovation for the repeated updating of a technology standard. We characterize equilibria in an open or con-sortium <b>standard</b> and <b>proprietary</b> <b>standard</b> environments. We highlight a possible free riding problem due to the public goods nature of the open standard. This implies {{a larger number of}} 8 ̆ 5 rms in a standard may have an adverse e¤ect on investment. However this e¤ect may be balanced and even o¤set by positive network e¤ects of larger participation. Turning as a second step to a <b>proprietary</b> <b>standard,</b> we show that introducing greater reward to a 8 ̆ 5 rm among the SOS members that provides the critical im-provement also can overcome the free riding problem. We derive the rule for setting optimal rewards...|$|R

Shimano's Octalink is a common <b>proprietary</b> <b>standard</b> that comes in two forms: version one for XTR, 105, Ultegra and Dura Ace; and version two for every other groupset such as XT, LX and Deore. Truvative and DMR also have their own <b>proprietary</b> spline interface <b>standards.</b> A 48 splined spindle, such as from Profile Racing, Demolition, and Eighth Inch, is mostly used for BMX, unicycles, and fixed-gear Freestyle.|$|R
50|$|DigiCipher 2, {{or simply}} DCII, is a <b>proprietary</b> <b>standard</b> format of digital signal {{transmission}} and it doubles as an encryption standard with MPEG-2/MPEG-4 signal video compression used on many communications satellite television and audio signals. The DCII standard was originally developed in 1997 by General Instrument, which then became the Home and Network Mobility division of Motorola, then bought by Google in Aug 2011, and lastly became the Home {{portion of the}} division to Arris.|$|R

Most open standards are royalty-free, and many <b>proprietary</b> <b>standards</b> are royalty-free as well. Examples of royalty-free standards include DisplayPort, VGA, VP8, and Matroska.|$|E
50|$|Several Sega Saturn {{games were}} {{converted}} to NV1-compatible formats on the PC such as Panzer Dragoon and Virtua Fighter Remix. However, the NV1 struggled in a market place full of several competing <b>proprietary</b> <b>standards,</b> and was marginalized by emerging Triangle polygon-based 2D/3D accelerators such as the low-cost S3 Graphics ViRGE, Matrox Mystique, ATI Rage, and Rendition Vérité V1000 among other early entrants. It ultimately did not sell well, despite being a promising and interesting device.|$|E
5000|$|DVB is an {{international}} standard for digital video broadcasting used by virtually all European broadcasters; some North American providers use incompatible <b>proprietary</b> <b>standards</b> such as DSS (DirecTV) or DigiCipher (Motorola) which predate the DVB standardisation effort. The packet size, tables and control information transmitted by proprietary systems require proprietary non-DVB receivers, even though the video itself nominally in some form will often still adhere to the MPEG-2 image compression standard defined by the Moving Picture Experts Group.|$|E

The mode also allows the operating system to continue performing background tasks, such as updating content from apps. Devices must be able to turn on in less than 500 milliseconds. The hardware requirements extend to battery life, in that systems must not drain more than 5% of battery capacity while idle over a 16-hour period.|$|R
50|$|The {{open source}} BiSS Interface (bidirectional/serial/synchronous) {{is based on}} a {{protocol}} which implements a real time interface. It enables a digital, serial and secure communication between controller, sensor and actuator. The BiSS protocol is designed in B mode and C mode (continuous mode). It is used in industrial applications which require transfer rates, safety, flexibility and a minimized implementation effort. The BiSS interface has roots in SSI and a simplified INTERBUS; competing solutions are the <b>proprietary</b> <b>standards</b> of Hiperface and EnDat.|$|E
50|$|In {{the same}} {{timeframe}} {{of the late}} 1980s to mid-1990s, the IBM PC clones using the x86 architecture became more ubiquitous, yet had a very different path in sound design than other PCs and consoles. Early PC gaming {{was limited to the}} PC speaker, and some <b>proprietary</b> <b>standards</b> such as the IBM PCjr 3-voice chip. While sampled sound could be achieved on the PC speaker using pulse width modulation, doing so required a significant proportion of the available processor power, rendering its use in games rare.|$|E

Also, the axle on the wheel must fit in the fork ends (usually either a 9mm solid or hollow axle, or a 20mm thru-axle). Some manufacturers have introduced forks and matching hubs with <b>proprietary</b> <b>standards,</b> such as Maverick's 24mm axle, Specialized 25mm thru-axle and Cannondale's Lefty system.|$|E
50|$|Emoji were {{initially}} used by Japanese mobile operators, NTT DoCoMo, au, and SoftBank Mobile (formerly Vodafone). These companies each defined their own variants of emoji using <b>proprietary</b> <b>standards.</b> The first emoji {{was created in}} 1999 in Japan by Shigetaka Kurita. He {{was part of the}} team working on NTT DoCoMo's i-mode mobile Internet platform. Kurita took inspiration from weather forecasts that used symbols to show weather, Chinese characters and street signs, and from manga that used stock symbols to express emotions, such as lightbulbs signifying inspiration. The first set of 176 12×12 pixel emoji was created as part of i-mode's messaging features to help facilitate electronic communication, and to serve as a distinguishing feature from other services. Kurita created the first 180 emoji based on the expressions that he observed people making and other things in the city.|$|E

Visual modeling languages may be General-Purpose Modeling (GPM) languages (e.g., UML, Southbeach Notation, IDEF) or Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM) languages (e.g., SysML). They include industry open standards (e.g., UML, SysML, Modelica), as well as <b>proprietary</b> <b>standards,</b> such as the visual languages associated with VisSim, MATLAB and Simulink, OPNET, NetSim, NI Multisim, and Reactive Blocks. Both VisSim and Reactive Blocks provide a royalty-free, downloadable viewer that lets anyone open and interactively simulate their models. The community edition of Reactive Blocks also allows full editing of the models as well as compilation, {{as long as the}} work is published under the Eclipse Public License. Visual modeling languages are an area of active research that continues to evolve, as evidenced by increasing interest in DSM languages, visual requirements, and visual OWL (Web Ontology Language).|$|E
