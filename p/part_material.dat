The required draft angle depends on {{the size and shape}} of the feature, the depth of the mold cavity, how the part or pattern is being removed from the mold, the pattern or <b>part</b> <b>material,</b> the mold material, and the process type.

50|$|There {{are four}} failure theories: maximum shear stress theory, maximum normal stress theory, maximum strain energy theory, and maximum {{distortion}} energy theory. Out {{of these four}} theories of failure, the maximum normal stress theory is only applicable for brittle materials, and the remaining three theories are applicable for ductile materials.Of the latter three, the distortion energy theory provides most accurate results in majority of the stress conditions. The strain energy theory needs the value of Poisson’s ratio of the <b>part</b> <b>material,</b> which is often not readily available. The maximum shear stress theory is conservative. For simple unidirectional normal stresses all theories are equivalent, which means all theories will give the same result.|$|E
50|$|MPP aims {{to become}} the {{equivalent}} of a high speed 3D-printer that produces three-dimensional objects directly from powder materials. This technique is based on the process principles of xerographic printers, (for example, laser or LED printers) that combine electrostatic printing with photography. The MPP process approach uses the same fundamental principles to build solid objects on a layer-by-layer basis. Layers of powder materials are generated by attracting different metal- and/or ceramic powders to their respective position on a charged pattern on a photoreceptor by means of an electrostatic field. The attracted layer is transferred to a punch and transported to the consolidation unit where each layer of <b>part</b> <b>material</b> is sintered onto the previous by pressure and heat. The procedure is repeated layer-by-layer until the three-dimensional object is fully formed and consolidated.|$|E
50|$|A sub-surface {{compressive}} {{residual stress}} profile is measured using {{techniques such as}} x-ray diffraction and hardness profile testing. The X-axis is depth in mm or inches and the Y-axis is residual stress in ksi or MPa. The maximum residual stress profile can {{be affected by the}} factors of shot peening, including: part geometry, <b>part</b> <b>material,</b> shot material, shot quality, shot intensity, and shot coverage. For example, shot peening a hardened steel part with a process and then using the same process for another unhardened part could result in overpeening; causing a sharp decrease in surface residual stresses, but not affecting sub-surface stresses. This is critical because maximum stresses are typically at the surface of the material. Mitigation of these lower surface stresses can be accomplished by a multi-stage post process with varied shot diameters and other surface treatments that remove the low residual stress layer.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedDemonstration of required reliability performance levels prior to system fielding {{has remained a}} challenge for the Army, and in recent years, the success rate of systems achieving their stated reliability performance in operational tests has declined. Realization of required reliability performance necessitates effective management strategies and techniques {{in order to reduce}} risks. "Designing-in" reliability up front is one of the critical elements to insure adequate system level reliability. It has also been ranked as one the top reliability problems by Program Managers. One design technique for maximizing inherent reliability is through the use of highly reliable parts, materials, and processes. Reliable parts, materials, and process are the building blocks of the total system reliability. They also have a significant role in overall program success because of the contribution to cost, schedule and performance goals. This research concentrates on the impacts of highly reliable parts and materials on the overall reliability of a weapon system. To gather these data, the researcher drew directly from experiences of <b>part,</b> <b>material,</b> and process professionals from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and contractors with whom they interface.
