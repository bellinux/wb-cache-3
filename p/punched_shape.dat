Then, the polynomial network and genetic algorithm were combined to construct the predicted and designed system. Through this approach, we can predict the forging results formed from arbitrary shaped punches, and design the optimal punch shape for forging recess. Through the interactive verifies of modeling repeatedly, the errors resulted from modeling analysis, network prediction and genetic algorithm optimal design are extremely limited. Consequently, the predicted and designed approach of optimal <b>punched</b> <b>shape</b> for forming recess in this study could be extended {{to the design of}} more complicated and difficult formed forging die...|$|E

A very large number of mechanical products such as furniture panels, shelves, cabinets, housing for electro-mechanical devices, etc. are created by using the sheet metal bending process. Bending tools need to satisfy the following two criteria: (1) tools should be able to withstand bending forces, and (2) tool shapes should be such that there is no tool-part interference. In this paper, we describe a methodology for automatically designing <b>shapes</b> of bending <b>punches</b> for bending multiple parts in a single setup. We create parametric geometric models of punches.

40|$|Self-similar {{problems}} of contact for non-convex punches are considered. The non-convexity of the <b>punch</b> <b>shapes</b> introduces differences {{from the traditional}} self-similar contact problems when punch profiles are convex and their shapes are described by homogeneous functions. First, three-dimensional Hertz type contact problems are considered for non-convex <b>punches</b> whose <b>shapes</b> are described by parametric-homogeneous functions. Examples of such functions are numerous including both fractal Weierstrass type functions and smooth log-periodic sine functions. It is shown that the region of contact in the problems is discrete and the solutions obey a non-classical self-similar law. Then the solution to a particular case of the contact problem for an isotropic linear elastic half-space when the surface roughness is described by a log-periodic function, is studied numerically, i. e. the contact problem for rough punches is studied as a Hertz type contact problem without employing additional assumptions of the multi-asperity approach. To obtain the solution, the method of non-linear boundary integral equations is developed. The problem is solved only on the fundamental domain for the parameter of self-similarity because solutions for other values of the parameter {{can be obtained by}} renormalization of this solution. It is shown that the problem has some features of chaotic systems, namely the global character of the solution is independent of fine distinctions between parametric-homogeneous functions describing roughness, while the stress field of the problem is sensitive to small perturbations of the <b>punch</b> <b>shape...</b>|$|R

40|$|Elastic {{solutions}} of {{a family}} of axisymmetric problems concerning frictionless contact between a rigid punch and a semi-infinite substrate are considered using the method of Green and Zerna and of Collins. The analysis is relevant to the interpretation of experimental results in materials indentation testing, e. g. when substrate properties need to be determined from load-displacement traces, and precise information about the indenter tip shape is crucial. Commonly used solutions for ideal <b>punch</b> <b>shapes,</b> e. g. those having spherical or conical tips, may only be viewed as approximations since, in practice, indenter tips are neither perfectly round nor infinitely sharp. In oder to illustrate the influence that small variations in <b>punch</b> <b>shape</b> may have on the contact behaviour, analytical solutions for a blunted Hertzian indenter and a rounded cone are obtained in parametric form, and their asymptotic behaviour at the extremes of low and high loads is investigated. A smooth punch is then considered of a general shape, given by a power series, and the resulting general solution is used as a basis for developing an inverse problem formulation of the tip share calibration procedure. The method allows the best match between the measured and predicted load-displacement dependencies to be established.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} {{compaction}} of pharmaceutical powders using different <b>shapes</b> of <b>punches.</b> We introduce {{a model of}} mechanical behaviour Drucker-Prager Cap (DPC), using the approach of compressible continuous media. The model parameters that are depending on the material density, were identified from experimental data and a calibration process was applied on Microcrystalline Cellulose (MCC) powder. In addition, the mathematical formulation of the boundary problem of compaction in rigid tools brings back to an optimization problem with constraint, which is solved by finite element method. The Drucker-Prager Cap model, which is implemented in Abaqus/Standard software, was employed using a user subroutine, USDFLD.

Unfortunately, a comprehensive scientific understanding of nanoscale wear is lacking. We initially investigate and discuss the mechanics of the tip-sample interaction in AM-AFM. Starting from existing analytical formulations, we introduce a method for conveniently choosing an appropriate probe and free oscillation amplitude that avoids exceeding a critical contact stress to minimize tip/sample damage. We then introduce a protocol for conducting consistent and quantitative AM-AFM wear experiments. The protocol involves determining the tip-sample contact geometry, calculating the peak repulsive force and normal stress over the course of the wear test, and quantifying the wear volume using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging. The peak repulsive tip-sample interaction force is estimated from a closed-form equation accompanied by an effective tip radius measurement procedure, which combines TEM and blind tip reconstruction.

40|$|In {{problems}} {{involving the}} relative sliding to two bodies, the frictional force {{is taken to}} oppose {{the direction of the}} local relative slip velocity. For a rigid flat punch sliding over a half-plane at any speed, it is shown that the velocities of the half-plane particles near the edges of the punch seem to grow without limit {{in the same direction as}} the punch motion. Thus the local relative slip velocity changes sign. This phenomenon leads to a paradox in friction, in the sense that the assumed direction of sliding used for Coulomb friction is opposite that of the resulting slip velocity in the region sufficiently close to each of the edges of the punch. This paradox is not restricted to the case of a rigid punch, as it is due to the deformations in the half-plane over which the pressure is moving. It would therefore occur for any <b>punch</b> <b>shape</b> and elastic constants (including an elastic wedge) for which the applied pressure, moving along the free surface of the half-plane, is singular.
