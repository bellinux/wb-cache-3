5|$|The sand {{devil is}} an ambush {{predator}} that spends much time {{buried in the}} bottom sediment. Its diet consists mainly of demersal teleost fishes such as croakers, goatfishes, and butterfishes. However, some types of demersal fishes such as jacks are rarely eaten, perhaps {{because they are more}} active and thus likely to escape attacks. Squid are a major secondary food source, particularly for smaller sharks. Crabs, shrimp, mantis shrimp, skates, and bivalves are infrequently eaten. This species feeds both during the day and at night. It tends to select prey approximately 50–60% as long as its mouth is wide; this size is consistent with what is predicted from optimal foraging theory to yield the most efficient rate of energy return. The variety of prey taken is greatest in fall and least in winter, and smaller sharks have a more varied diet than larger ones. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey species are Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), longspine <b>porgy</b> (Stenotomus caprinus), spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Gulf butterfish (Peprilus burti), red goatfish (Mullus auratus), dwarf goatfish (Upeneus parvus), and longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii). The relative importance of each differs across seasons (for example, squid are more important in winter), perhaps due to seasonal variation in their availability. A known parasite of the sand devil is the copepod Eudactylina spinula.|$|E
25|$|<b>Porgy</b> (1925), by DuBose Heyward, adapted {{into the}} play in 1927.

25|$|The detective {{enters and}} talks with Serena {{and her friends}} about the murders of Crown and Robbins. They deny {{knowledge}} of Crown's murder, frustrating the detective. Needing a witness for the coroner's inquest, he next questions an apprehensive <b>Porgy.</b> Once <b>Porgy</b> admits to knowing Crown, he is ordered to come and identify Crown's body. Sportin' Life tells <b>Porgy</b> that corpses bleed {{in the presence of}} their murderers, and the detective will use this to hang <b>Porgy.</b> <b>Porgy</b> refuses to identify the body, but is dragged off anyway. Bess is distraught, and Sportin' Life puts his plan into action. He tells her that <b>Porgy</b> will be locked up for a long time, and points out that he is the only one still here. He offers her happy dust, and though she refuses, he forces it on her. After she takes a whiff, he paints a seductive picture of her life with him in New York ("There's a boat dat's leavin' soon for New York"). She regains her strength and rushes inside, slamming the door on his face, but he leaves a packet of happy dust on her doorstep, and settles down to wait.|$|E

25|$|The {{libretto}} of <b>Porgy</b> and Bess {{tells the}} story of <b>Porgy,</b> a disabled black street-beggar living in the slums of Charleston, South Carolina.

25|$|A week later, Jake {{leaves to}} go fishing with his crew, one of whom observes that {{it looks as if}} a storm is coming in. Peter, still unsure of his crime, returns from prison.

Serena prays to remove Bess's affliction ("Oh, Doctor Jesus"), and promises <b>Porgy</b> that Bess will be well by five o'clock. As the day passes, a strawberry woman, Peter (the Honey Man) and a crab man each pass by with their wares ("Vendors' Trio"). As the clock chimes five, Bess recovers from her fever. <b>Porgy</b> tells Bess that he knows she has been with Crown, and she admits that Crown has promised to return for her. <b>Porgy</b> tells her she is free to go if she wants to, and she tells him that although she wants to stay, she is afraid of Crown's hold on her. <b>Porgy</b> asks her what would happen if there was no Crown, and Bess tells <b>Porgy</b> she loves him and begs him to protect her, and he promises that she will never have to be afraid again ("I Loves You, Porgy").|$|E

They are bottom feeding pelagic fishes, with small mouths equipped with strong teeth adapted for handling small fishes and invertebrates with hard shells. Most do not exceed a size of about , but some may grow to four times that length. They often school, and will migrate between reefs. Larger fish enter estuaries and harbours.|$|R

They are thought to spawn in July and August.There is some debate over the Jolthead <b>porgy's</b> diet.
