Sinologist Joseph Needham has disputed this and claimed that China's GDP per capita exceeded Europe by substantial margins from the 5th century BCE onwards, holding that Han China was much wealthier than the contemporary Roman Empire. The widespread circulation of coin cash enriched many merchants, who invested their money in land and became wealthy landowners. The government's efforts to circulate cash had empowered the very social class which it actively tried to suppress through heavy taxes, fines, confiscations, and <b>price</b> <b>regulation</b> schemes.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to complexly cover the area of <b>pricing</b> <b>regulation</b> of {{medicinal}} products in the Czech Republic. That means to analyze relevant Czech legislation and decision-making by the supreme judicial bodies in the country, investigate their historical background, compare conclusions already made in the area, and introduce own original suggestions. The reason for the research is an insufficient amount of sources covering the chosen topic, and in particular, the absolute absence of published papers which would embrace the topic of <b>pricing</b> <b>regulation</b> of medicinal products in the Czech Republic as whole. The thesis is composed of three chapters, each of them dealing with {{different aspects of the}} <b>pricing</b> <b>regulation</b> of medicinal products. Chapter One is introductory and defines basic terminology used in the thesis: <b>price,</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>regulation,</b> <b>pricing</b> decision, and medicinal product. Chapter Two examines the historical background of current legislation and possible approaches in the area of <b>pricing</b> <b>regulation</b> of medicinal products in the Czech Republic.

40|$|In {{the context}} in which {{transfer}} pricing may represent a mechanism through which multinationals have the possibility to move funds internationally, in order to prevent the base erosion and profit shifting between multinationals, countries over the world have adopted various transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations.</b> Furthermore, some of the countries adopted stricter regulations than others. The objective of our research was to identify the level of strictness for the transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations</b> from the European countries. To achieve this objective, we analyzed the transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations</b> of all European countries and we built a transfer pricing strictness index, based on which we defined 4 categories of countries (where category 1 includes the countries with the least strict transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations</b> and category 4 countries with the strictest regulations). After that, we illustrated how these categories are distributed on the European map. In order to collect the information, we used the transfer pricing guides issued by the Big Four companies for the year 2015. The study`s results show that the strictness of the transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations</b> decreases from the west of Europe to east. Moreover, most of the countries were included in category 2, respectively category 3, meaning that the transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations</b> from the European continent are not so flexible, but in the same time are not so strict...|$|R
25|$|In {{the period}} {{following}} the Second World War the wood industry in Trøndelag was outdated and had limited capacity. Forest-owners {{were forced to}} sell large portions of their lumber to industries in Eastern Norway. The long distances and hence transport costs cut into the prices, giving the forest-owners reduced revenue. At the time the forest industry was until 1957 organized through a <b>price</b> <b>regulation</b> mechanism, with maximum prices for lumber set by the government. Prices were set through negotiations between forest owner associations, organized by drainage system, and the industry.|$|E
25|$|As war dragged on, Richmond became {{crowded with}} {{training}} and transfers, logistics and hospitals. Prices rose dramatically despite government efforts at <b>price</b> <b>regulation.</b> A movement in Congress led by Henry S. Foote of Tennessee argued for moving the capital from Richmond. At {{the approach of}} Federal armies in mid-1862, the government's archives were readied for removal. As the Wilderness Campaign progressed, Congress authorized Davis to remove the executive department and call Congress to session elsewhere in 1864 and again in 1865. Shortly {{before the end of}} the war, the Confederate government evacuated Richmond, planning to relocate farther south. Little came of these plans before Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House, Virginia on April 9, 1865. Davis and most of his cabinet fled to Danville, Virginia, which served as their headquarters for about a week.|$|E
2500|$|On May 11, 1941, President Roosevelt {{signed the}} Executive Order 8734 which created the Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply (OPACS). On August 28, 1941, an Executive Order 8875 {{transformed}} OPACS into the Office of Price Administration (O.P.A.). After the U.S. entered WWII in December 1941, O.P.A. was tasked with rationing. [...] The Emergency Price Control Act passed on January 30, 1942 legitimized the O.P.A {{as a separate}} federal agency. It merged O.P.A. with two other agencies: Consumer Protection Division and Price Stabilization Division of the Advisory Commission to the Council of National Defense. The council {{was referred to as}} the National Defense Advisory Commission (NDAC), and was created on May 29, 1940. NDAC emphasized voluntary and advisory methods in keeping prices low. Leon Henderson, the NDAC commissioner for price stabilization, became the head of OPACS and of O.P.A. in 1941–1942. He oversaw a mandatory and vigorous <b>price</b> <b>regulation</b> that started in May 1942 after O.P.A. introduced the General Maximum <b>Price</b> <b>Regulation</b> (GMPR). It was heavily criticized by the American business community. In response, O.P.A. mobilized the public on behalf of the new guidelines and said that it reduced the options for those who were seeking higher rents or prices. O.P.A. had its own Enforcement Division, which documented the rising tide of violations: quarter million in 1943 and more than 300,000 during the next year.|$|E

40|$|As {{the number}} of {{multinational}} enterprises increases, {{the number of}} transactions between entities belonging to the same multinational group rises as well. Intercompany transactions generally offer the opportunity to shift income from one jurisdiction to the other. Income shifting can be driven by tax aspects, for instance a tax rate differential, or by firm-specific tax attributes like tax losses. At the same time, profit shifting imposes risk to governments as it may reduce tax revenues. More and more governments are therefore introducing and extending transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations</b> in order to combat profit shifting through intercompany transactions. This study examines 44 countries and analyses the development of different aspects of transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations</b> over a time period of nine years (2001 - 2009).

2500|$|The FPC was a five-member {{regulatory}} body {{appointed by the}} President and confirmed by the Senate. One of the FPC's strongest leaders was Leland Olds. Olds' insistence on enforcing the Natural Gas Act of 1938 raised the ire {{of the oil industry}} in Texas and led {{to the end of his}} tenure at the FPC. Robert Caro's book Master of the Senate describes how Lyndon B. Johnson defeated Leland's re-appointment by orchestrating a McCarthyism-style smear campaign. The tactics involved having the staff of the House Un-American Activities Committee dig up old writings, which were then taken out of context to falsely paint Olds as a communist. The subcommittee in charge of reappointment was stacked against Leland and coached by Johnson.

40|$|As {{the number}} of {{multinational}} enterprises increases, {{the number of}} transactions between entities be-longing to the same multinational group rises as well. Intercompany transactions generally offer the opportunity to shift income from one jurisdiction to the other. Income shifting can be driven by tax aspects, for instance a tax rate differential, or by firm-specific tax attributes like tax losses. At the same time, profit shifting imposes risk to governments as it may reduce tax revenues. More and more governments are, therefore, introducing and extending transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations</b> in order to combat profit shifting through intercompany transactions. In addition, the OECD has made a great effort in providing guidelines {{on the design of}} transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations</b> which are, by now, widely accepted in member and non-member countries. This study examines transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations</b> in 44 countries based on an extensive data collection and analyses the development of different aspects of such regulations over a time period of nine years (2001 - 2009). The considered aspects comprise the existence and applicability of transfer pricing regu-lations, i. e. whether transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations</b> have been introduced in the given country and, if so, to which transactions they apply, the available methods for the determination of transfer prices as well as implemented documentation requirements including submission deadlines. Furthermore, transfer pricing penalties, the statute of limitations, and advance pricing agreements are studied. The survey shows considerable differences between countries regarding those aspects depending not only on their geographical location but also on their position as a high- or low-tax country. Moreover, the analysis of the development of transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations</b> over time reveals that, within the past decade, a considerable number of countries have introduced or tightened transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations,</b> while not a single country has loosened or abolished them. In order to show the differences of the regulations in a single measure, an attempt is made to catego-rize transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations</b> with respect to their stringency and impact. The new measure extends existing variables by following a well comprehensible approach, but more importantly by referring to a more comprehensive data collection.

It opportunely chose Nigeria {{as a case study}} of transfer pricing issues in developing countries as Nigeria was devising and implementing its own transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulation.</b> In early 2012, Nigeria issued draft transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations</b> for consultation with a view to publishing them {{at the end of the}} same year. In order to gauge the reaction of the stakeholders in Nigeria to the adoption and implementation of transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations</b> and other related issues, a questionnaire was designed and administered to 140 respondents from eight different stakeholders groups including Nigerian tax authority, multinational companies in the petroleum sector and other organisations involved in tax matters. The questionnaire elicited their views on the (i) form of adoption of transfer pricing regulations; (ii) motive behind the adoption of the regulations; (iii) administrative resource capacity of the Nigerian tax authority; (iv) barriers that might hinder successful implementation of the regulations; and (v) needs for guidance and support. Institutional theory and resource-based view were employed as a theoretical lens through which to guide the study and to provide a platform against which to analyse the responses to the questionnaire and the interviews. The analysis of the responses to the questionnaire was thus undertaken subsequent to the adoption of the transfer pricing system which enabled informed reflection and critical analysis to be carried out on the results of the analysis. In addition, interviews with 16 experts were conducted subsequent to the issue and preliminary analysis of the responses to the questionnaire in order to gauge their reaction to the views being expressed by the respondents. This enabled a reflective analysis to be undertaken when assessing the information content emerging from the responses. The findings of the study indicate that the OECD transfer pricing framework, which is the transfer pricing system of choice amongst the developed countries, is not the most preferred framework for the <b>regulation</b> of transfer <b>pricing</b> in Nigeria. It also reveals that whilst the Nigerian tax authority has the administrative capacity to develop a transfer pricing team and other necessary platforms for the adoption and implementation of transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations,</b> the lack of sufficient transfer pricing experts, political will and inadequate comparable information are the major potential barriers that might hinder the successful implementation of transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations</b> in Nigeria. These findings should enable policy makers and other stakeholders in Nigeria to review their transfer pricing policies and find a way to overcome the identified potential barriers. This thesis is the first of its kind to empirically investigate the transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations</b> in Nigeria with a particular emphasis on the petroleum sector. It also further establishes the use of institutional theory and resource-based view framework in transfer pricing studies and especially, by extending its application to the adoption and implementation of transfer <b>pricing</b> <b>regulations</b> with a particular emphasis on the petroleum sector.
