25|$|An Active Reader <b>Passive</b> <b>Tag</b> (ARPT) {{system has}} an active reader, which transmits {{interrogator}} signals and also receives authentication replies from passive tags.|$|E
25|$|Passive RFID tags {{can also}} report sensor data. For example, the Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform is a <b>passive</b> <b>tag</b> that reports temperature, {{acceleration}} and capacitance to commercial Gen2 RFID readers.|$|E
25|$|RFID tags can {{be either}} passive, active or battery-assisted passive. An active tag has an {{on-board}} battery and periodically transmits its ID signal. A battery-assisted passive (BAP) has a small battery on board and is activated when {{in the presence of}} an RFID reader. A <b>passive</b> <b>tag</b> is cheaper and smaller because it has no battery; instead, the tag uses the radio energy transmitted by the reader. However, to operate a <b>passive</b> <b>tag,</b> it must be illuminated with a power level roughly a thousand times stronger than for signal transmission. That makes a difference in interference and in exposure to radiation.|$|E
30|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>tags</b> {{systems have}} limited link budget [2]; however, they are {{attracting}} attention {{due to their}} low cost and long life. The reader first energizes <b>passive</b> <b>tags</b> by means of electromagnetic energy and then identifies the objects by collecting unique IDs stored in the tag’s memory.|$|R
30|$|Between {{active and}} <b>passive</b> RFID, <b>passive</b> <b>tags</b> are {{shown to be}} the most {{suitable}} for an indoor application of tracking workers, materials and equipment due to their small size, low cost and low maintenance requirements (Costin et al. 2012 a). <b>Passive</b> <b>tags</b> also hold potential benefits for the operation and maintenance phase of a facility. First, <b>passive</b> <b>tags</b> are inexpensive (US$ 0.10 each or less) and can essentially last {{for a long time in}} typical indoor environments. Moreover, a facility can potentially have hundreds or thousands of tag objects, adding unnecessary costs. Although the <b>passive</b> <b>tags</b> have a significant smaller read range than an active tag, it is not necessarily beneficial to have a long read range in the first place. Having a long read range means more tags will be read at a certain time, potentially causing data overloads (Costin et al. 2012 b). Missed reads (false positives) can also result due to the high volume of tags. One limitation to <b>passive</b> <b>tags</b> is the fact that they are easily obstructed by objects. In this case, active or semi-active tags could be used.|$|R

Twins leverages a newly observed phenomenon called critical state that is caused by interference among <b>passive</b> <b>tags.</b> The author expands on the previous object tracking methods, which are mostly device-based, and reveals a new interference model and their extensive experiments for validation.

30|$|Semi-passive RFID tags {{are very}} similar to <b>passive</b> <b>tags</b> except for the {{addition}} of a small battery (Zhang and Amin 2006). This battery allows the tag IC to be constantly powered (Li et al. 2009). This removes the need for the aerial to be designed to collect power from the incoming signal. Aerials can therefore be optimised for the backscattering signal. Semi-passive RFID tags are faster in response as compared to <b>passive</b> <b>tags.</b> Active RFID tags or beacons, on the other hand, have an internal power source which is used to power any ICs and generate the outgoing signal (Ni et al. 2004; Jin and Lu 2006). They may have longer range and larger memories than the <b>passive</b> <b>tags,</b> as well as the ability to store additional information sent by the transceiver. At present, the smallest active tags are {{about the size of a}} coin. Many active tags have practical ranges of tens of metres, and a battery life of up to 10  years. As <b>passive</b> <b>tags</b> are cheaper to manufacture and have no battery, the majority of RFID tags in existence are of this variety.|$|R

40|$|This lecture {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), a technology enabling automatic identification of objects at a distance without requiring line-of-sight. Electronic tagging {{can be divided into}} technologies that have a power source (active tags), and those that are powered by the <b>tag</b> interrogation signal (<b>passive</b> tags); the focus here is on <b>passive</b> <b>tags.</b> An overview of the principles of the technology divides <b>passive</b> <b>tags</b> into devices that use either near field or far field coupling to communicate with a tag reader. The strengths and weaknesses of the approaches...|$|R
25|$|In 2011, {{the cost}} of <b>passive</b> <b>tags</b> started at US$0.09 each; special tags, meant to be mounted on metal or {{withstand}} gamma sterilization, can go up to US$5. Active tags for tracking containers, medical assets, or monitoring environmental conditions in data centers start at US$50 and can go up over US$100 each. Battery-Assisted <b>Passive</b> (BAP) <b>tags</b> are in the US$3–10 range and also have sensor capability like temperature and humidity.|$|R
50|$|Passive RFID tags have no {{internal}} power source and derive their power from an external power source, typically the interrogating signal generated by an RFID interrogator. The interrogation signal {{is required to}} both power and communicate with the RFID tag. For a PJM signal the un-modulated carrier component powers the <b>passive</b> <b>tag</b> and the low-level modulated component conveys data to the tag. The tag uses the un-modulated carrier signal as a phase reference for demodulating the data signal. There is no reduction in the transfer of power to the tag during PJM.|$|E
50|$|The term RTLS {{was created}} (circa 1998) at the ID EXPO trade show by Tim Harrington (WhereNet), Jay Werb, (PinPoint), and Bert Moore, (Automatic Identification Manufacturers, Inc.(AIM)). It {{was created to}} {{describe}} and differentiate an emerging technology that not only provided the automatic identification capabilities of active RFID tags, but also added the ability to view the location on a computer screen. It was at this show that the first examples of a commercial radio based RTLS system were shown by PinPoint and WhereNet. Although this capability had been utilized previously by military and government agencies, the technology had been too expensive for commercial purposes. In the early 1990s, the first commercial RTLS were installed at three healthcare facilities in the United States, and {{were based on the}} transmission and decoding of infrared light signals from actively transmitting tags. Since then, new technology has emerged that also enables RTLS to be applied to <b>passive</b> <b>tag</b> applications.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Currently RFID (radio {{frequency}} identification) {{technology is}} pushing {{to the market}} mainly forced by industry. <b>Passive</b> <b>tags</b> in the UHF (ultra high frequency) region are of particular interest e. g. for supply chains, showing a tendency to become state of the art. <b>Passive</b> <b>tags</b> obtain their energy from the readers during communication. The reader has to power the tag by radiating energy {{at the same time}} as it has to receive the tag answer. Due to this so-called self-interference the reader frontend design becomes more complex than that of typical communication systems. In this paper we present the implementation of a modular UHF reader frontend for a flexible RFID testbed...|$|R

The idea is that when a human object moves, he may block or reflect the RF signals between the reader and tags. Based on the estimation of Doppler Shift and Tag Read Rate variations, DTrack can detect whether a human object enters {{in the system and}} further track the moving direction of the object. DTrack uses commercial readers and off-the-shelf <b>passive</b> <b>tags</b> and is scalable and easy for large-scale deployments.

Multiple instances of the anti-collision scheme are executed for each set of tags in parallel and in an autonomous manner. Simulation results show that our approach makes significant improvements in reducing collisions and interrogation delay and thus increasing the reading rate and throughput of RFID systems. ...|$|R
