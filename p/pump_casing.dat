2500|$|Byron, {{like most}} U.S. nuclear plants, {{has been the}} subject of various actions by the NRC. Escalated Enforcement Actions {{represent}} one type. From 19972007 the Byron plant has received five such actions, two of which resulted in a total of $150,000 in fines. A $100,000 fine was issued on February 27, 1997 due to problems with excessive silt build up in two separate locations at the Byron facility; the NRC fined the plant $50,000 for each problem. The NRC levied an additional $55,000 in fines in October 1997 when the plant failed technical specifications surveillance guidelines. Specifically, they violated rules that require the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) <b>pump</b> <b>casing</b> and discharge piping high points be vented once every 31 days. The potential safety consequence of the violation affiliated with the second fine was considered [...] "low." [...] As of 2007, the last NRC Escalated Enforcement Action against the Bryon Station came in 2005 when an engineer deliberately falsified surveillance reports to show he had completed work that was incomplete; though the plant could have been fined up to $60,000 the NRC chose not to impose the fine.|$|E

50|$|A {{screw pump}} {{is a more}} {{complicated}} type of rotary pump that uses two or three screws with opposing thread — e.g., one screw turns clockwise and the other counterclockwise. The screws are mounted on parallel shafts that have gears that mesh so the shafts turn together and everything stays in place. The screws turn on the shafts and drive fluid through the pump. As with other forms of rotary pumps, the clearance between moving parts and the <b>pump's</b> <b>casing</b> is minimal.|$|R

50|$|Most {{centrifugal}} pumps are not self-priming. In other words, the <b>pump</b> <b>casing</b> must {{be filled with}} liquid before the pump is started, or the pump {{will not be able}} to function. If the <b>pump</b> <b>casing</b> becomes filled with vapors or gases, the pump impeller becomes gas-bound and incapable of pumping. To ensure that a centrifugal pump remains primed and does not become gas-bound, most {{centrifugal pumps}} are located below the level of the source from which the pump is to take its suction. The same effect can be gained by supplying liquid to the pump suction under pressure supplied by another pump placed in the suction line.|$|E

Solutions from the program are used to show how wear varies with the design of the pump, its application in terms of flow and rotational speed and with the particulars such as size, concentration, type, etc., of the slurry.

40|$|A {{suspension}} {{system for the}} BiVACOR biventricular assist device (BiVAD) has been developed and tested. The device features two semi-open centrifugal impellers mounted on a common rotating hub. Flow balancing is achieved through {{the movement of the}} rotor in the axial direction. The rotor is suspended in the <b>pump</b> <b>casings</b> by an active magnetic {{suspension system}} in the axial direction and a passive hydrodynamic bearing in the radial direction. This paper investigates the axial movement capacity of themagnetic bearing system and the power consumption at various operating points. The force capacity of the passive hydrodynamic bearing is investigated using a viscous glycerol solution. Axial rotor movement in the range of ± 0. 15 mm is confirmed and power consumption is under 15. 5 W. The journal bearing is shown to stabilize the rotor in the radial direction at the required operating speed. Magnetic levitation is a viable suspension technique for the impeller of an artificial heart to improve device lifetime and reduce blood damage...|$|R
5000|$|The {{tube well}} casing houses the inlet, cylinder, piston valves and rising main of a [...] "down-the-hole" [...] type hand <b>pump.</b> <b>Casing</b> {{to support the}} {{external}} surfaces of the borehole against collapse may be needed, either temporarily or permanently, and is often made of PVC pipe, which is both cheap and inert.|$|E
50|$|An {{end face}} {{mechanical}} seal, {{also referred to}} as a mechanical face seal but usually simply as a mechanical seal, is a type of seal utilised in rotating equipment, such as pumps, mixers, blowers, and compressors. When a pump operates, the liquid could leak out of the pump between the rotating shaft and the stationary <b>pump</b> <b>casing.</b> Since the shaft rotates, preventing this leakage can be difficult. Earlier pump models used mechanical packing (otherwise known as Gland Packing) to seal the shaft. Since World War II, mechanical seals have replaced packing in many applications.|$|E
50|$|An {{impeller}} is {{a rotating}} {{component of a}} centrifugal pump, usually made of iron, steel, bronze, brass, aluminium, rubber or plastic, which transfers energy from the motor that drives the pump to the fluid being pumped by accelerating the fluid outwards {{from the center of}} rotation. The velocity achieved by the impeller transfers into pressure when the outward movement of the fluid is confined by the <b>pump</b> <b>casing.</b> Impellers are usually short cylinders with an open inlet (called an eye) to accept incoming fluid, vanes to push the fluid radially, and a splined, keyed, or threaded bore to accept a drive-shaft.|$|E
40|$|Today, {{intricate}} {{problems of}} surface treatment {{can be solved}} through precision cladding using advanced laser technology. Metallic and carbidic coatings have been produced with high power lasers for years, and current investigations show that laser cladding is also a promising technique {{for the production of}} dense and precisely localized ceramic layers. In the present work, powders based on Al 2 O 3 /TiO 2 were used to clad aluminium light alloys. The compact layers are up to 1 mm thick and show a non-porous cast structure as well as a homogeneous network of vertical cracks. The high adhesive strength is due to several chemical and mechanical bonding mechanisms and may exceed that of plasma-sprayed coatings. Compared to thermal spray techniques, the material deposition is strictly focused onto small functional areas of the workpiece. Thus, being a precision technique, laser cladding is not recommended for large-area coatings. Examples of applications are filigree parts of <b>pump</b> <b>casings...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractNickel Aluminium Bronze (NAB) alloys {{have been}} used {{extensively}} in marine applications such as propellers, couplings, <b>pump</b> <b>casings</b> and <b>pump</b> impellers due to their enhanced mechanical properties such as tensile strength, creep resistance and corrosion resistance. However, {{there have been several}} instances of in-service failures of the alloy due to high cycle fatigue (HCF). The present research aims at characterizing the HCF behavior of as-cast NAB at room temperature in the presence of casting defects by analysing the effect of variation in mean stress and the influence of size and location of defects on the HCF life of NAB. A significant decrease in the HCF life was observed with an increase in the tensile mean stress, irrespective of the defect size. Further, a considerable drop in the HCF life was observed with an increase in the size of defects and proximity of the defects to the surface. However, the surface proximity was seen to override the influence of defect size and maximum cyclic stress...|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} been made to {{investigate}} provisions of water supply in areas where availability of potable water is scarce due to high organic matter, red and yellowish in colour and low in pH. The water quality was determined for surface and shallow ground water. Clean potable water was acquired by dugging a well with concrete casing in podsolic soil, provided with a shallow well hand <b>pump</b> with PVC <b>casing</b> in non-podsolic soil, and one provided with a shallow well hand <b>pump</b> with PVC <b>casing</b> connected to a small water treatment unit in podsolic soil.

The best potable water supply can be provided through the installment of auger shallow well hand <b>pumps</b> with PVC <b>casing</b> and connected to a small water treatment unit.

50|$|Some ring-liquid is also entrained {{with the}} {{discharge}} stream. This liquid {{is separated from}} the gas stream by other equipment external to the pump. In some systems, the discharged ring-liquid is cooled by a heat exchanger or cooling tower, {{then returned to the}} <b>pump</b> <b>casing.</b> In some recirculating systems, contaminants from the gas become trapped in the ring-liquid, depending on system configuration. These contaminants become concentrated as the liquid continues to recirculate, eventually causes damage and reduced life to the pump. In this case, filtration systems are required to ensure that contamination is kept to acceptable levels.|$|E
5000|$|The primary sealing {{surfaces}} are {{the heart of}} the device. A common combination consists of a hard material, such as silicon carbide, Ceramic or tungsten carbide, embedded in the <b>pump</b> <b>casing</b> and a softer material, such as carbon in the rotating seal assembly. Many other materials can be used depending on the liquid's chemical properties, pressure, and temperature. These two rings are in intimate contact, one ring rotates with the shaft, the other ring is stationary. These two rings are machined using a machining process called lapping in order to obtain the necessary degree of flatness.|$|E
50|$|A {{peristaltic}} pump {{is a type}} of positive displacement pump. It contains fluid within a flexible tube fitted inside a circular <b>pump</b> <b>casing</b> (though linear {{peristaltic pump}}s have been made). A number of rollers, shoes, or wipers attached to a rotor compresses the flexible tube. As the rotor turns, the part of the tube under compression closes (or occludes), forcing the fluid through the tube. Additionally, when the tube opens to its natural state after the passing of the cam it draws (restitution) fluid into the pump. This process is called peristalsis and is used in many biological systems such as the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) {{systems are}} {{designed}} based upon having redundant systems with replaceable orbital replacement units (ORUs). These ORUs {{are designed to}} be swapped out fairly quickly, but some are very large, and some are made up of many components. When an ORU fails, it is replaced on orbit with a spare; the failed unit is sometimes returned to Earth to be serviced and re-launched. Such a system is not feasible for a 500 + day long-duration mission beyond low Earth orbit. The components that make up these ORUs have mixed reliabilities. Components that make up the most mass-such as computer housings, <b>pump</b> <b>casings,</b> and the silicon board of PCBs-typically are the most reliable. Meanwhile components that tend to fail the earliest-such as seals or gaskets-typically have a small mass. To better understand the problem, my project is to create a parametric model that relates both the mass of ORUs to reliability, as well as the mass of ORU subcomponents to reliability...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of possible variants of {{reconstruction of the}} power equipment is fulfilled and the conclusion concerning the prospects of such work {{with the use of}} composite materials is reached. The data on the technical characteristics of composite repair materials for various purposes are presented, the results of repairs of power equipment, in particular the technology for the recovery of the boarding surfaces of the diffuser rings and protection of the <b>pumps</b> D 1250 <b>casings</b> are provided. The technology of the recovery pneumatic cylinder, hydraulic cylinder rod, as well as the unique technology of restoration of working surfaces of the impeller vanes of transfer pump, that had been destroyed by corrosion in conjunction with the cavitation processes and were considered as not restorable is described. The restored impeller was in operation during a year and only thereafter it was removed for restoration. Another composite material discussed in the article – diagum – makes it possible to perform a series of repairs associated with restoration of the rubber-covered surfaces of <b>pump</b> <b>casings</b> as well as with restoration of various surfaces of the conveyor belts. Taking the excellent adhesive properties of this composite into account, restoration of worn stainless steel sieve screens to remove abrasive material was fulfilled with the aid of it. The restoration was accomplished via the use of the conveyor belt which application time had expired, that was glued to a metal sieve with diagum. The use of the composites is economically justified, because the application of them in repairs reduces, firstly, terms of restoration work and, secondly, the price of repairs. Third, equipment that was damaged beyond repair is being commissioned by the use of the mentioned composites.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the 1997 Laser Materials Processing Conference, ICALEO' 97. Part 1 (of 2), San Diego, CA, USA, 17 - 20 November 1997 Cavitation erosion {{is a form}} of erosive wear {{occurring}} on {{the metal}} surface which encounters high fluid flow velocity. Typical examples of cavitation erosion can be found on high speed impellers, <b>pump</b> <b>casings,</b> ultrasonic mixers in the food and pharmaceutical industries, etc. Austenitic stainless steels AISI 316 L is widely used as pumping components for marine and urban water supply systems. 316 L stainless steel has poor cavitation erosion resistance despite its high pitting corrosion resistance in marine condition. Surface modification of 316 L stainless steel was achieved by surface melting the specimens by a 2 kW CW Nd-YAG laser to produce a rapidly quenched surface layer. The cavitation erosion characteristic of laser surface melted 316 L stainless steel was studied by means of a 20 kHz ultrasonic vibrator at a peak-to-peak amplitude of 30 μm in 3. 5 % NaCl solution at temperatures 23 ° and 50 °C. Its pitting corrosion behaviour was also studied at 23 °C by electrochemical method. The cavitation erosion resistance of 316 L stainless steel was found to be improved by 22 % at 23 °C after laser melting. The pitting potential of laser melted 316 L also increased from 359 to 452 mV at 23 °C. The deformation mechanism by cavitation erosion and the pitting morphology of laser melted 316 L stainless steel were also be examined. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
50|$|With a double-suction pump {{tied to a}} {{close-coupled}} elbow, flow {{distribution to}} the impeller is poor and causes reliability and performance shortfalls. The elbow divides the flow unevenly with more channeled {{to the outside of}} the elbow. Consequently, one side of the double-suction impeller receives more flow at a higher flow velocity and pressure while the starved side receives a highly turbulent and potentially damaging flow. This degrades overall pump performance (delivered head, flow and power consumption) and causes axial imbalance which shortens seal, bearing and impeller life.To overcome cavitation:Increase suction pressure if possible.Decrease liquid temperature if possible.Throttle back on the discharge valve to decrease flow-rate.Vent gases off the <b>pump</b> <b>casing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Suction {{cavitation}} {{occurs when}} the pump suction is under a low-pressure/high-vacuum condition where the liquid turns into a vapor at {{the eye of the}} pump impeller. This vapor is carried over to the discharge side of the pump, where it no longer sees vacuum and is compressed back into a liquid by the discharge pressure. This imploding action occurs violently and attacks the face of the impeller. An impeller that has been operating under a suction cavitation condition can have large chunks of material removed from its face or very small bits of material removed, causing the impeller to look spongelike. Both cases will cause premature failure of the pump, often due to bearing failure. Suction cavitation is often identified by a sound like gravel or marbles in the <b>pump</b> <b>casing.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} department {{should have}} a special maintenance worker {{that is responsible for}} the maintenance and repair of the machine. mud pumps and other mechanical equipment should be inspected and maintained on a scheduled and timely basis to find and address problems ahead of time, in order to avoid unscheduled shutdown. The worker should attend {{to the size of the}} sediment particles; when finding large particles, the mud pump wearing parts should frequently be checked for repairing needs or replacement. The wearing parts for mud pumps include <b>pump</b> <b>casing,</b> bearings, impeller, piston, liner, etc. Advanced antiwear measures should be adopted to increase the service life of the wearing parts, which can reduce the investment cost of the project, and improve production efficiency. At the same time, wearing parts and other mud pump parts should be repaired rather than replaced when possible.|$|E
40|$|Environmentally {{assisted}} cracking (EAC) of lightwater reactor (LWR) materials {{has affected}} nuclear reactors {{from the very}} introduction of the technology. Corrosion problems have afflicted steam generators from the very introduction of pressurized water reactor (PWR) technology. Shippingport, the first commercial PWR operated in the United States, developed leaking cracks in two Type 304 stainless steel (SS) steam generator tubes as early as 1957, after only 150 h of operation. Stress corrosion cracks were observed in the heat-affected zones of welds in austenitic SS piping and associated components in boiling-water reactors (BRWs) as early as 1965. The degradation of steam generator tubing in PWRs and the stress corrosion cracking (SCC) of austenitic SS piping in BWRs {{have been the most}} visible and most expensive examples of EAC in LWRs, and the repair and replacement of steam generators and recirculation piping has cost hundreds of millions of dollars. However, other problems associated with the effects of the environment on reactor structures and components am important concerns in operating plants and for extended reactor lifetimes. Cast duplex austenitic-ferritic SSs are used extensively in the nuclear industry to fabricate <b>pump</b> <b>casings</b> and valve bodies for LWRs and primary coolant piping in many PWRs. Embrittlement of the ferrite phase in cast duplex SS may occur after 10 to 20 years at reactor operating temperatures, which could influence the mechanical response and integrity of pressure boundary components during high strain-rate loading (e. g., seismic events). The problem is of most concern in PWRs where slightly higher temperatures are typical and cast SS piping is widely used...|$|R

From the above-mentioned facts, higher concentrations {{of iron and}} manganese in water cause many technological problems including failure of water supply systems’ operation and water quality deterioration.

Additionally, as the tube opens to its natural state after the passing of the cam ("restitution" [...] or [...] "resilience") fluid flow is induced to the pump. This process is called peristalsis and is used in many biological systems such as the gastrointestinal tract. Typically, there will be two or more rollers, or wipers, occluding the tube, trapping between them a body of fluid. The body of fluid is then transported, at ambient pressure, toward the pump outlet. Peristaltic pumps may run continuously, or they may be indexed through partial revolutions to deliver smaller amounts of fluid.|$|E

40|$|With {{regard to}} the reactor coolant pump and high {{flow-rate}} circulating pump, the requirements on the compactness of the structure, safety, and hydraulic performance are particularly important. Thus, the mixed-flow pump with cylindrical casing is adopted in some occasions. Due to the different characteristics between the special cylindrical casing and the common <b>pump</b> <b>casing,</b> {{the influence of the}} special casing on a mixed-flow pump characteristics was numerically investigated to obtain better performance and flow structure in the casing. The results show that the models with cylindrical casing have much worse head and efficiency characteristics than the experimental model, and this is caused by the flow in the <b>pump</b> <b>casing.</b> By moving the guide vanes half inside the <b>pump</b> <b>casing,</b> the efficiency gets improved while the low pressure zone at the corner of outlet pipe and <b>pump</b> <b>casing</b> disappeared. When the length of <b>pump</b> <b>casing</b> increases from the size equal to the diameter of outlet pipe to that larger than it, the efficiency drops obviously and the flow field in the outlet pipe improved without curved flow. In addition, the length of the <b>pump</b> <b>casing</b> has greater impacts on the pump performance than the radius of it...|$|E
