He supported Senator Barack Obama in both his Democratic primary race {{and in the}} 2008 general election. Later, Peretz expressed disappointment with Obama, telling The New York Times Magazine: “I’m not sure I feel betrayed, but it’s close... our first African-American <b>president</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> less to fight AIDS in Africa than George Bush, he’s done nothing on human rights.” ...|$|E
5000|$|All {{federal laws}} must, after counter-signature, be {{signed by the}} President before they can come into effect. Upon signing, the President has to check if the law was passed {{according}} to the order mandated by the Constitution and/or if {{the content of the}} law is constitutional. If not, he or she has the right to refuse to sign the law, thus effectively vetoing it. Some scholars also consider it possible that the president has the full veto authority on any bill, this however, is not how past presidents handled their power. As yet (2017), this has happened only eight times and no <b>President</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> it more often than two times during his term: ...|$|E

2500|$|As other <b>presidents</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> Bush {{issued a}} series of pardons during his last days in office. On December 24, 1992, he granted {{executive}} clemency to six former government employees implicated in the Iran-Contra scandal of the late 1980s, most prominently former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. Bush described Weinberger, who was scheduled to stand trial on January 5, 1993, for criminal charges related to Iran-Contra, as a [...] "true American patriot".|$|R
5000|$|During {{the height}} of the Cuervo-Barredo case, Planas made an eloquent and impassioned speech in front of a youth rally, criticizing Commonwealth President Manuel Quezon's {{interference}} in the judiciary. The following day she appeared on the front pages of the metropolitan papers with the headline [...] "U.P. COED ATTACKS QUEZON." [...] She was summoned by Malacañang and asked why she lambasted the president. She replied that she was only criticizing what the <b>president</b> <b>had</b> <b>done.</b>|$|R
40|$|Early in his administration, Rodrigo Duterte, the {{controversial}} sixteenth {{president of the}} Philippines, did what no other Filipino <b>president</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> before - announce a separation from the geopolitical interests of its former colonial master, the United States of America. Beyond the personal slights caused by the US criticism of his anti-drug campaign lies a deeper sense of historical grievance that has been ingrained in Duterte's generation and his identity as a Mindanaoan. Not only does he represent Mindanao's resentment towards "imperial Manila", but also a historical blowback against "US imperialism". Duterte's nationalist exhortations {{can be traced to}} the cycle of regime narratives in the Philippines, which serves as a medium for institutional continuity and change through the mobilisation of ideas at a discursive level. By reviving the anti-US nationalism of his youth, Duterte is repudiating the liberal reformist, albeit elitist, narrative of the Aquino-to-Aquino regimes. Duterte's so-called "pivot to China" is also a dramatic reversal of his predecessors' strong anti-China and rabidly pro-American foreign policy position. This paper blends Vivien A. Schmidt's discursive institutional analytical framework with Stephen Skowronek's concept of presidential leadership in political time to analyse how crafted narratives are transformed into governance scripts that bind together a coalition of interests within a particular institutional setting...|$|E

5|$|The adverse results {{momentarily}} {{put a stop}} to Republican {{calls to}} impeach Johnson, who was elated by the elections. Nevertheless, once Congress met in November, the Judiciary Committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against Johnson. After much debate about whether anything the <b>President</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> was a high crime or misdemeanor, the standard under the Constitution, the resolution was defeated by the House of Representatives on December 7, 1867, by a vote of 57 in favor to 108 opposed.|$|R
50|$|While {{vice presidents}} used to {{regularly}} {{preside over the}} Senate, modern vice <b>presidents</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so only rarely, usually only when swearing in new senators, during joint sessions, announcing {{the result of a}} vote on a significant bill or confirmation, or when casting a tie-breaking vote. The Senate chooses a president pro tempore to preside in the vice president's absence. Modern presidents pro tempore, too, rarely preside over the Senate. In practice, the junior senators of the majority party typically preside in order to learn Senate procedure.|$|R
50|$|On December 3, 2013, the House Judiciary Committee held {{a hearing}} {{on whether or not}} to impeach the President. At the hearing, there were views among Republicans that the <b>president</b> <b>has</b> not <b>done</b> his duty and that he abused his {{executive}} power.|$|R

Alfredo Moreno Charme, Minister of Foreign Affairs said [...] "How many other <b>presidents</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> the same?" [...] and Obama responded [...] "This is the only one."

5000|$|More than 67 million Americans {{watched the}} debate, {{making it the}} most widely viewed first presidential debate in 32 years. A CBS poll of {{uncommitted}} voters found that 46% thought that Romney <b>had</b> <b>done</b> better, 22% thought Obama <b>had</b> <b>done</b> better, and 32% {{thought that it was}} a tie. A CNN poll found a greater advantage for Romney among debate watchers overall, with 67% believing the former Massachusetts governor <b>had</b> <b>done</b> better, 25% believing that the <b>president</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> better, and 8% believing that it was a tie. A Gallup poll found that 72% of the debate watchers believed Romney was the clear winner, 20% believed that Obama had won, and 9% believed it was a tie or had no opinion; the widest margin of victory for any presidential debate in Gallup history. Time Magazines Joe Klein stated, [...] "It was, in fact, one of the most inept performances I’ve ever seen by a sitting President." ...|$|R

50|$|Although Republicans {{expressed}} anger {{with his}} actions, the 1867 elections generally went Democratic. No seats in Congress were directly elected in the polling, but the Democrats {{took control of}} the Ohio General Assembly, allowing them to defeat for re-election one of Johnson's strongest opponents, Senator Benjamin Wade. Voters in Ohio, Connecticut, and Minnesota turned down propositions to grant African Americans the vote. The adverse results momentarily put a stop to Republican calls to impeach Johnson, who was elated by the elections. Nevertheless, once Congress met in November, the Judiciary Committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against Johnson. After much debate about whether anything the <b>President</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> was a high crime or misdemeanor, the standard under the Constitution, the resolution was defeated by the House of Representatives on December 7, 1867, by a vote of 57 in favor to 108 opposed.|$|R

2500|$|However, {{in a third}} case, {{the special}} review court for FISA, the {{equivalent}} of a Circuit Court of Appeals, opined differently should FISA limit the President's inherent authority for warrantless searches in the foreign intelligence area.

2500|$|Hoover {{originally}} planned to make {{only one or}} two major speeches, and to leave the rest of the campaigning to proxies, as sitting <b>presidents</b> <b>had</b> traditionally <b>done.</b> However, encouraged by Republican pleas and outraged by Democratic claims, Hoover entered the public fray. In his nine major radio addresses Hoover primarily defended his administration and his philosophy of government. Hoover urged voters to hold to the [...] "foundations of experience," [...] rejecting the notion that government interventionism could save the country from the Depression.|$|R

5000|$|Cuban {{refugees}} were always welcome {{with open arms}} until the 1990s. President Bill Clinton “reacted by doing what no U.S. <b>president</b> <b>had</b> ever <b>done</b> - he ordered {{a halt to the}} special treatment of Cuban refugees. For more than thirty years, a succession of <b>presidents</b> <b>had</b> dispensed unprecedented financial aid to those fleeing Cuba.” [...] These new arrivals of {{refugees were}} labeled as “los marielitos” as they arrived in large numbers. Unlike the prior waves of Cuban immigration, these new waves lacked the skills the earlier Cuban settlers held. Also, Americans perceived these new refugees negatively for their darker skin tone and more rapid Spanish speaking compared to prior Cuban refugees.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s Amtrak {{eliminated}} several of its lightly-traveled lines. Ridership stagnated at roughly 20 million passengers per year amid uncertain government aid from 1981 to about 2000. Ridership increased during {{the first decade of}} the 21st century after implementation of capital improvements in the Northeast Corridor and rises in automobile fuel costs. Both the Obama and the Clinton administration announced plans for new high-speed rail lines in their first term. In the case of Clinton the only tangible outcome was the introduction of the Acela Express in the year 2000. Obama even mentioned his rail plans in the State of the Union address, the first time in decades a <b>President</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> so. While several small scale improvements to rail lines were financed by federal money, more ambitious plans in Florida, Ohio and other states failed when newly elected Republican governors stopped existing high-speed rail plans and returned federal funding. Currently (2016) construction is under way for California High-Speed Rail which will link Los Angeles and San Francisco in under three hours.|$|R
50|$|The Basic Law did {{not create}} an office of Vice President but {{designated}} the President of the Bundesrat (by constitutional custom the head of government {{of one of the}} sixteen german states, elected by the Bundesrat in a determined order of annual alternation) as replacement. If the office of president falls vacant, he or she temporarily assumes the powers of the President and acts as head of state until a successor is elected, but does not assume the office of president as such (which would be unconstitutional, as no member of a legislation or government on federal or state level can be President at the same time). While doing so, he or she does not continue to exercise the role of chair of the Bundesrat. If the President is unable to perform his duties temporarily (for example <b>Presidents</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so frequently, while being abroad on a state visit), he can in his own discretion delegate his powers or parts of them to the President of the Bundesrat.|$|R
5000|$|Although she lacked Evita's charisma, {{the grieving}} widow at first {{attracted}} {{support from the}} nation. She pledged to uphold the social market economy policies embodied in the 1973 [...] "Social Pact" [...] as well her husband's long-held economic nationalism; her first significant economic policy decisions were the enactment of a new, pro-labor employment contract law and the granting to YPF of a monopoly over filling stations. Even extremist groups, having fallen out with Juan Perón in previous months, publicly offered support to her. However she cancelled meetings with various constituent and political groups, and the sympathy resulting from her husband's death soon dissipated. Her government purged most leftists from university posts and the administration, and (as her husband and other Argentine <b>presidents</b> <b>had</b> <b>done)</b> used Federal intervention powers to unseat leftist governors. Following a string of political murders and a break by the Montoneros with the government, on 30 September Perón signed the Anti-Terrorism Law: {{the first in a}} series of measures which eroded constitutional rights for the sake of combating leftist violence.|$|R

Mr. Boulder's first idea had been to have Mr. Spillikins attend the university. Dr. Boomer, the <b>president,</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> his best to spread abroad the idea that a university education was perfectly suitable even for the rich; that it didn't follow that because a man was a university graduate he need either work or pursue his studies any further; that what the university aimed to do was merely to put a certain stamp upon a man. That was all. And this stamp, according to the tenor of the president's convocation addresses, was perfectly harmless. No one ought to be afraid of it. As a result, a great many of the very best young men in the City, who had no need for education at all, were beginning to attend college.
