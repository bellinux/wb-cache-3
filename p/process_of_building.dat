5|$|Due to {{a variety}} of factors, {{including}} the deterioration of the main campus building dating from 1844 and the need for additional space, the university considered building a new building designed specifically for the university beginning in the 1850s. Then on October 3, 1860, the board of trustees for the school resolved to begin the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> a new primary hall to be used by the university. Reverend Alvin F. Waller was placed in charge of the efforts to raise the funds needed for a building. However, this was unsuccessful and on November 19, 1862, the board again passed a resolution calling for a new structure and forming a committee of Waller, Gustavus Hines, Josiah Lamberson Parrish, J. Lamson, and John H. Moores to prepare plans.|$|E
5|$|Several {{ownership}} schemes {{were considered}} in the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> and running the system. One plan, which named city officials as the owners and operators of the network, was scrapped because the city lacked the core competency {{to do it on}} its own, as well as the $25–30 million capital investment required for the initial construction. The plan which was ultimately adopted entailed a private company building and running the network. This plan met opposition from the Institute for Local Self Reliance, an organization that stated that it believed that the city should build the network itself, and then contract a private company to maintain it.|$|E

5|$|The <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> skyscrapers {{became more}} sophisticated, {{starting}} with the acquisition {{of the real estate}} needed for the site. Brokers working on commission would secretly acquire the individual lots of land required for a project, operating under a variety of names to avoid having the price increase once a planned build became known. The properties {{at the front of the}} site would typically be bought first, so if news broke of the skyscraper then those owning property at the back of the plot would have little choice but to sell anyway. The funding for skyscraper developments was normally lent by banks, insurance companies, or raised through bonds sold through a specialised bond house, with the latter becoming increasingly popular after World War I.|$|E
5|$|The signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania {{were the}} twenty Lithuanian men {{who signed the}} Act of Independence of Lithuania on February 16, 1918. The signatories were elected to the Council of Lithuania by the Vilnius Conference in September 1917 and {{entrusted}} with the mission of establishing an independent Lithuanian state. The proclaimed independence was established only in late 1918, after Germany lost World War I and its troops retreated from Lithuanian territory. What followed was a long <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> the state, determining its borders, and gaining international diplomatic recognition. The signatories succeeded in their mission and independent Lithuania survived until the Soviet Union occupied the state on June 15, 1940.|$|E
5|$|Discussion about {{splitting}} the route into two {{started in the}} early in 1960s. The Public Roads Administration {{felt that it was}} unnecessary to have a cross-fjord service, as at the time there was a road from Vangshylla to Levanger which sufficed. The administration was also in the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> a road from Kjerringvik to Venneshamn, which would allow the ferry to drop that service. On 1 June 1964, the service was split in two: Vangshylla–Kjerringvik and Hokstad–Levanger. At the same time, the service was upgraded to a national road connection, and the full responsibility for funding was transferred to the ministry. The Vangshylla–Kjerringvik service was taken over by Innherredsferja, while the Hokstad–Levanger service was taken over by Innherredsferja II. In 1968, the state granted sufficient guarantees to allow a new ferry to be purchased. In the same year, the road from Framverran via Venneshamn to Kjerringvik was opened. The new ferry was similar to Innherredsferja II; it was built in Kristiansund for NOK1,555,000 and originally named Skarnsund. Innherredsferja was sold to an operator in Agder for NOK50,000. At the same time, Fremverran and Venneshamn were transferred from the municipality of Verran to Mosvik, while Ytterøy, Skogn and Frol merged with Levanger.|$|E
40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{specification}} for an assessment tool that integrates sustainable development into briefing and design <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> in developing countries. The {{building and construction}} industry have a significant {{role to play in}} supporting sustainable development in developing countries. However until the implications of sustainable development for the building and construction industry in developing countries are understood and interpreted into a plan of action, little progress can be made. The research proposal aims to make a contribution to knowledge within the field of sustainable development and building and construction in developing countries. The study suggests that an effective way of beginning to integrate sustainable development into building and construction is to make sustainable development an explicit goal during the briefing and design <b>process</b> <b>of</b> the <b>building.</b> The study develops a specification for assessment tool that enables the goal of sustainable development to be interpreted into building and construction objectives and shows how this can be used in the briefing and design <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings.</b> The study is based on both a qualitative and quantitative approach. Through critical review of literature and inductive analysis key concepts pertaining to sustainability, sustainable development, developing country contexts, assessment frameworks, and building and construction are defined. These are compared and analysed to formulate a specification for an assessment tool. In order to test and validate findings the specification is compared with an existing building assessment tool, the Sustainable Building Assessment Tool. All hypothesis developed by the study are successfully demonstrated and the study is successful in proposing a specification for an assessment tool that integrates sustainable development into briefing and design <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> in developing countries.

5|$|Few air units or {{anti-aircraft}} batteries {{were stationed}} in the home islands during {{the early months of}} the Pacific War. The General Defense Command (GDC) had been formed in July 1941 to oversee the defense of the home islands, but all combat units in this area were assigned to the four regional military districts (the Northern, Eastern, Central and Western districts) which reported directly to the Ministry of War. As a result, the GDC's functions were limited to coordinating communications between the Imperial General Headquarters—Japan's highest military decision-making body—and the military districts. In early 1942, forces allocated to the defense of Japan comprised 100 Imperial Japanese Army Air Force (IJAAF) and 200 Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) fighter aircraft, many of which were obsolete, as well as 500 Army-manned and 200 IJN anti-aircraft guns. Most of the IJAAF and IJN formations in the home islands were training units which had only a limited ability to counter Allied attacks. The Army also operated a network of military and civilian observation posts to provide warning of air attack and was in the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> radar stations. Command and control of the air defenses was fragmented, and the IJAAF and IJN did not coordinate their activities or communicate with each other. As a result, the forces were unable to react to a sudden air attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{substance}} Rhoca-Gil {{was used}} to fix the leakages, but the substance failed to work properly. Not only did it fail to polymerize and stop the leaks, it also contaminated the surroundings with acrylamide. The entire process of fixing the leak and cleaning up the toxicity delayed the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> the tunnel by one year; and it was first opened on 22 August 1999. Further complications arose due to conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the construction company. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during incidents {{that should have been}} addressed in 1995, and were never taken seriously. About sixty houses received damage due to the construction of the tunnel. An evaluation performed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was used on fixing the leaks; however, the report claimed this was, to a large extent, a waste of money due to inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the entire construction of the railway.|$|E
5|$|Shamrock Rovers F.C. is a members' club {{owned by}} the Shamrock Rovers Members Club. The Shamrock Rovers Members Club was {{originally}} formed as the 400 Club in November 2002, by the then privately owned football club's board of directors, to raise funds through the fan base, with {{the sole purpose of}} facilitating a mortgage {{for the development of the}} stalled stadium project in Tallaght. The monthly membership fee was set at €40. However, it became apparent to the members that the funds raised were being used for purposes outside of the stated objective. As a result, the membership took control of the 400 Club, adopted a transparent structure and constitution, and declared itself totally independent of the then board of Shamrock Rovers. The 400 Club consortium played a crucial role in the survival of Shamrock Rovers when the club entered examinership in April 2005. They paid off a portion of the club's debts and assumed responsibility for running it. After the successful acquisition of the club through the examinership process, the 400 Club Trustees became the Board of Directors of Shamrock Rovers Football Club and began the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> a sustainable club through sensible business practices. Numerous clubs and supporters groups subsequently sought their advice with regard to using the model of the 400 club elsewhere. At the annual meeting of the 400 Club in 2006, the members voted to rename it as the SRFC Members Club, reflecting the reality of their ownership of the football club. At the 2008 meeting, the monthly membership fee was increased to €50. In January 2012, there were more than 400 members of the club. Membership is open to all.|$|E

5|$|The remastered {{version was}} {{predicated}} on the transition of LucasArts from a developer and publisher into a licensor and publisher in 2013 shortly after its acquisition by Disney. Under new management, LucasArts licensed several of its intellectual properties (IP), including Grim Fandango, to outside developers. Schafer was able to acquire {{the rights to the}} game with financial assistance from Sony, and started the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> out the remaster within Double Fine Productions. Schafer said that the sale of LucasArts to Disney had reminded them of the past efforts of former LucasArts president Darrell Rodriguez to release the older LucasArts titles as Legacy Properties, such as the 2009 rerelease of The Secret of Monkey Island. Schafer also noted that they had tried to acquire the property from Lucasarts in the years prior, but the frequent change in management stalled progress. When they began to inquire about the rights with Disney and LucasArts following its acquisition, they found that Sony, through their vice president of publisher and developer relations Adam Boyes, was also looking to acquire the rights. Boyes stated that Sony had been interested in working with a wide array of developers for the PlayStation 4, and was also inspired to seek Grim Fandango after seeing developers like Capcom and Midway Games revive older properties. Boyes' determination was supported by John Vignocchi, VP of Production for Disney Interactive, who also shared memories of the game, and was able to bring in contacts to track down the game's assets. After discovering they were vying for the same property, Schafer and Boyes agreed to work together to acquire the IP and subsequent funding, planning to make the re-release a remastered version. Sony did not ask for any of IP rights for the game, instead only asking Double Fine to give the PlayStation platforms console exclusivity in exchange for funding support, similar to their Pub Fund scheme they use to support independent developers.|$|E
