After nuclease treatment, resistance was demonstrated by the ability to alter the electrophoretic mobility of a labeled complementary phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotide. Both 5 '- and 3 '-exonuclease activities were retarded by methylphosphonate linkages. Methylphosphonate-containing oligodeoxynucleotides with 1 - 5 adjacent <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>linkages</b> were tested as substrates for the endonucleases DNase I and DNase II.

40|$|A new {{strategy}} for site-selective DNA hydrolysis, which {{takes advantage of}} the difference in reactivity between the <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>linkages</b> at the target site and the others, is presented. As the molecular scissors, homogeneous Ce(IV) /ethylenediamine-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetate (EDTA) complex is used without being bound to any sequence-recognizing moiety. When a gap structure is formed at the target site by using two short oligonucleotides and the composite is treated with the Ce(IV) /EDTA complex at pH 7. 0 and 37 °C, the gap site in the substrate DNA is preferentially hydrolyzed over the double-stranded portion of the DNA. Site-selective DNA scission is also achieved by forming a bulge structure at the target site {{with the use of the}} appropriate oligonucleotide. These site-selective scissions are based on the following two factors: (i) the <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>linkages</b> in a single-stranded DNA are far more susceptible to the hydrolysis by the Ce(IV) complex than are the linkages in double-stranded DNA, and (ii) the <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>linkages</b> in the bulge sites are still more reactive than those in single-stranded DNA.

Using in vitro selection, here we identified deoxyribozymes that sequence-specifically hydrolyze DNA with multiple turnover and rate enhancement of 108 (possibly as high as 1014). The new DNA catalysts require both Mn 2 + and Zn 2 +, which is intriguing because many natural DNA nucleases are bimetallic protein enzymes. The first deoxyribozyme (DNA enzyme) was identified by in vitro selection in 1994 and cleaves an RNA phosphodiester bond 1.

Further, phosphates of nucleotides in the DNA chain are acidic, so at physiologic pH the H+ ion is dissociated.

At least 24 products were detected by ion-exchange chromatography and paper electrophoresis after alkaline hydrolysis of the polymer. Not all of these products could be identified. The main mechanistic pathways for depolymerization by the cleavage of <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>linkages</b> during alkaline hydrolysis involved (a) participation by the 2 -hydroxy group and a cyclic phosphodiester intermediate (leading to a series of mannitol-based products) and (b) participation by the 3 -hydroxy group in the cyclization of mannitol (leading to a series of products based on 1, 4 -anhydromannitol).

The retron msr RNA folds into a characteristic secondary structure that contains a conserved guanosine residue {{at the end of}} a stem loop. Synthesis of DNA by the retron-encoded reverse transcriptase (RT) results in a DNA/RNA chimera which is composed of small single-stranded DNA linked to small single-stranded RNA.

5000|$|The {{decanoic acid}} portion of {{daptomycin}} is synthesized by fatty acid synthase machinery (Figure 2). Post-translational {{modification of the}} apo-acyl carrier protein (ACP, thiolation, or T domain) by a phosphopantetheinyltransferase (PPTase) enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a flexible phosphopantetheine arm from coenzyme A to a conserved serine in the ACP domain through a <b>phosphodiester</b> <b>linkage.</b> The holo-ACP can provide a thiol on which the substrate and acyl chains are covalently bound during chain elongations. The two core catalytic domains are an acyltransferase (AT) and a ketosynthase (KS). The AT acts upon a malonyl-CoA substrate and transfers an acyl group to the thiol of the ACP domain. This net transthiolation is an energy-neutral step. Next, the acyl-S-ACP gets transthiolated to a conserved cysteine on the KS; the KS decarboxylates the downstream malonyl-S-ACP and forms a β-ketoacyl-S-ACP. This serves as the substrate for the next cycle of elongation. Before the next cycle begins, however, the β-keto group undergoes reduction to the corresponding alcohol catalyzed by a ketoreductase domain, followed by dehydration to the olefin catalyzed by a dehydratase domain, and finally reduction to the methylene catalyzed by an enoylreductase domain. Each KS catalytic cycle results in the net addition of two carbons. After three more iterations of elongation, a thioesterase enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis, and thus release, of the free C-10 fatty acid. To synthesize the peptide portion of daptomycin, the mechanism of an NRPS is employed. The biosynthetic machinery of an NRPS system is composed of multimodular enzymatic assembly lines that contain one module for each amino acid monomer incorporated. [...] Within each module are catalytic domains that carry out the elongation of the growing peptidyl chain. The growing peptide is covalently tethered to a thiolation domain; here it is termed the peptidyl carrier protein, as it carries the growing peptide from one catalytic domain to the next. Again, the apo-T domain must be primed to the holo-T domain by a PPTase, attaching a flexible phosphopantetheine arm to a conserved serine residue. An adenylation domain selects the amino acid monomer to be incorporated and activates the carboxylate with ATP to make the aminoacyl-AMP. Next, the A domain installs an aminoacyl group on the thiolate of the adjacent T domain. The condensation (C) domain catalyzes the peptide bond forming reaction, which elicits chain elongation. It joins an upstream peptidyl-S-T to the downstream aminoacyl-S-T (Figure 7). Chain elongation by one aminoacyl residue and chain translocation to the next T domain occurs in concert. The order of these domains is C-A-T. In some instances, an epimerization domain is necessary in those modules where L-amino acid monomers are to be incorporated and epimerized to D-amino acids. The domain organization in such modules is C-A-T-E.|$|E
