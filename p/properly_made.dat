25|$|Jeans {{or other}} sturdy, {{close-fitting}} trousers made of canvas or denim, {{designed to protect}} the legs and prevent the trouser legs from snagging on brush, equipment or other hazards. <b>Properly</b> <b>made</b> cowboy jeans also have a smooth inside seam to prevent blistering the inner thigh and knee while on horseback.|$|E
25|$|Coal {{deposits}} {{had been}} {{worked in the}} area close to the Fife coast for centuries. Coal had been important {{in the manufacture of}} lime, and of salt, both of which required huge quantities of coal. Transport of heavy minerals before the era when roads had been <b>properly</b> <b>made</b> was expensive, and most minerals were carried on the backs of pack horses. The expense of even a short transit hugely increased the cost of the product.|$|E

50|$|Most of {{the nobility}} in Toledo pledged loyalty to Henry II. Garci, unable {{to defend the}} city <b>properly,</b> was <b>made</b> to {{surrender}} the Grand Mastership to Gonzalo Mexía (who already exercised that title {{in the court of}} Henry II), in exchange for the title of Conde of Oropesa and Valdecorneja.|$|R
25|$|Iconodules further {{argued that}} {{decisions}} {{such as whether}} icons ought to be venerated were <b>properly</b> <b>made</b> by the church assembled in council, not imposed on the church by an emperor. Thus the argument also involved {{the issue of the}} proper relationship between church and state. Related to this was the observation that it was foolish to deny to God the same honor that was freely given to the human emperor, since portraits of the emperor were common and the iconoclasts did not oppose them.|$|E
25|$|In March 1911, Captain Ritchie {{returned}} to the Chilco with his crew and began the salvage operations and temporary repairs that were necessary {{to get her back}} to Quesnel where she could be <b>properly</b> <b>made</b> ready for the season. In late April, Ritchie decided that the river was clear and started the trip downstream to Quesnel. Upon entering the head of the Cottonwood Canyon, he saw that the foot of the canyon was blocked solid with ice. The Chilco was rapidly speeding towards the deadly obstacle and {{it was too late to}} turn back. Fortunately, the captain and the crew escaped to the shore on the lifeboat and there were no injuries or loss of life. (Other reports were made in the local paper, then the Fort George Herald, that the escape was made onto the ice). Nonetheless, the end result was the same, the crew survived, but the Chilco did not. She was torn apart in the icy waters and not one piece of her was ever recovered.|$|E
2500|$|A winter bivouac {{can also}} be made in a snow cave. It has thermal {{properties}} similar to an igloo and is effective both at providing protection from wind and low temperatures. [...] A <b>properly</b> <b>made</b> snow cave can be 0°C (32°F) or warmer inside, even when outside temperatures are −40°C (−40°F).|$|E

50|$|Muslin {{is often}} the cloth of choice for theater sets. It is used to mask the {{background}} of sets and to establish the mood or feel of different scenes. It receives paint well and, if treated <b>properly,</b> can be <b>made</b> translucent.|$|R
50|$|It was {{his film}} career, which brought him his fortune, that caused his downfall. The tension and {{pressure}} of success {{prevented him from}} sleeping and breathing <b>properly.</b> This <b>made</b> him take overdoses of sleeping tablets. This cost him dearly in his later days. He lost his hearing and could only see partially. He could not walk properly. His neural system got damaged severely. He tried to fight it but could not. He died on 26 May 2012.|$|R
2500|$|It is not {{necessary}} {{in the case of}} a small enterprise to have an elaborate or extensive classification of accounts. A few will answer all purposes in such cases, providing that the purpose of each account is well defined and charges and credits to these accounts during the year are <b>properly</b> <b>made.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{dialogue}} between the two brothers is an amicable contest between fact and philosophy. The younger draws his arguments from common apprehension, and the obvious appearance of things; the elder proceeds on a profounder knowledge, and argues from abstracted principles. Here the difference of their ages is <b>properly</b> <b>made</b> subservient to a contrast of character" [...] (Warton).|$|E
60|$|The {{peculiar}} joy of {{the mountain}} railway is that, if it is <b>properly</b> <b>made,</b> a loaded car--not a toy engine; it is too rough a game for delicate, respectable engines--will career {{from top to bottom}} of the system, and go this way and that as your cunningly-arranged switches determine; and afterwards--and this is a wonderful and distinctive discovery--you can send it back by 'lectric.|$|E
60|$|THE FEMALE FIGURE. Oh, don't be so cruel. I'm not fit to die. I {{will never}} bite anyone again. I {{will tell the}} truth. I will do good. Is it my fault if I was not <b>made</b> <b>properly?</b> Kill him; but spare me.|$|R
50|$|Economist J.

50|$|In October 2011 the Daily Mirror {{reported}} {{a story that}} Letwin had thrown away more than 100 secret government documents in public bins in St. James's Park, with no real care to dispose of them <b>properly.</b> Enquiries <b>made</b> by the Information Commissioner's Office found that although Letwin did not dispose of any government documents; he had, in fact, disposed of constituents' personal and confidential letters to him and therefore did breach data protection rules. Letwin later apologised for his actions.|$|R
6000|$|He {{answered}} that no such [...] "resurrection from the dead" [...] (as he called it) {{had ever happened}} in his long experience. On leaving me, he asked for the latest prescriptions that had been written. I inquired {{what he was going}} to do with them.

The King of Jerusalem [...] gives Joseph {{an order}} for a throne. Joseph works on it for two [...] years and makes it two spans too short.

6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} I can only repeat, general, that our foolhardy freak has {{put us in}} {{collision}} with your sentries," [...] said Lagrange, with a slight hauteur, that replaced his former jauntiness; [...] "and we were very <b>properly</b> <b>made</b> prisoners.

50|$|Murtis, when {{produced}} <b>properly,</b> are <b>made</b> {{according to}} the design rules of the Shilpa Shastras. They recommend materials, measurements, proportion, decoration and symbolism of the murti. Explanation of the metaphysical significance of each stage of manufacture and the prescription of specific mantras to sanctify the process and evoke and invoke {{the power of the}} deity in the image are found in the liturgical handbooks the Agamas and Tantras. By the Prana Pratishtha ceremony, the idol becomes identical with the deity.|$|R
50|$|For their Speed Bump, Liz and Michael {{traveled}} on {{foot to the}} nearby Kantina food truck to prepare a traditional skewered dish called kokoretsi by wrapping sections of meat intestines. Once the dish was <b>made</b> <b>properly</b> and presented to the chef, they could continue racing.|$|R
50|$|Once Ita's {{expedition}} had left, Spanish authorities mistakenly {{believed the}} Dutch {{had left the}} Caribbean.

60|$|Extract of Tea and Coffee.--Dr. Rae speaks {{very highly}} of the {{convenience}} of extract of tea. Any scientific chemist could make it, but he should be begged to use first-rate tea. The extract from first-rate tea makes a very drinkable infusion, but that from second-rate tea is not good, the drink made from the extract always a grade inferior to that made directly from the leaves. By pouring a small quantity of the extract into warm water, the tea is made; and, though inferior in taste to <b>properly</b> <b>made</b> tea, it has an equally good effect on the digestion.|$|E

50|$|COCKERS, or COGGERS, <b>properly</b> half-boots <b>made</b> of untanned leather, {{or other}} stiff materials, and {{strapped}} under the shoe; but old stockings without feet, used as gaiters by hedgers and ploughmen, are often so called. Cockers occurs in Bishop Hall's Satires. In Lancashire {{the word is}} often used for stockings. There is a small place not far from Bolton, called Doff-Cocker, where, my friend, Mr. Turner, informs me, {{it used to be}} the fashion for the country people who came from church or market to pull off their stockings and walk barefoot home.|$|R
50|$|Foott was {{determined}} that the men should always be supplied <b>properly,</b> and <b>made</b> a point of letting the officers of the Lines of Communication, living palatially on board the Aragon, {{know exactly what he}} thought of them whenever they placed obstacles in his way. He remained in the post for two years. In France he found the logistics far more complex, but much better organised, and increasingly free of shortages, he was able to deliver there a quality of service that he {{had never been able to}} achieve at Gallipoli.|$|R
50|$|Napier {{followed}} the Lion with two new H-block designs: the H-16 (Rapier) and the H-24 (Dagger). The H-block has a compact layout, {{consisting of two}} horizontally opposed engines, lying one atop or beside another. Since the cylinders are opposed, the motion in one is balanced by the motion on the opposing side, leading to no first order vibration or second order vibration. In these new designs, Napier chose air cooling but in service, the rear cylinders proved to be impossible to cool <b>properly,</b> which <b>made</b> the engines unreliable.|$|R

If we find we have cheated the customs, you can trust us to put things straight. Only, we would sooner deal with somebody important; yourself, for example." ...|$|E
60|$|She only said, indeed, {{that he must}} go to his tailor's at {{once and}} have his uniform <b>properly</b> <b>made,</b> and not just put up with what they gave him. But he could feel {{that she was very}} much upset. It was on his lips to console her with the spoken thought that he would be {{out of the way of}} that beastly divorce, but the {{presence}} of Imogen, and the knowledge that his mother would not be out of the way, restrained him. He felt aggrieved that she did not seem more proud of him. When Imogen had gone to bed, he risked the emotional.|$|E
60|$|Here Winterborne had {{remained}} after the girl's abrupt departure, {{to see that}} the wagon-loads were <b>properly</b> <b>made</b> up. Winterborne was connected with the Melbury family in various ways. In addition to the sentimental relationship which arose from his father having been the first Mrs. Melbury's lover, Winterborne's aunt had married and emigrated with the brother of the timber-merchant many years before--an alliance that was sufficient to place Winterborne, though the poorer, on a footing of social intimacy with the Melburys. As in most villages so secluded as this, intermarriages were of Hapsburgian frequency among the inhabitants, and there were hardly two houses in Little Hintock unrelated by some matrimonial tie or other.|$|E
60|$|Edward {{received}} them wrathfully, {{and ordered}} {{the heads of the}} whole six to be struck off. However, the good Queen fell upon her knees, and besought the King to give them up to her. The King replied, 'I wish you had been somewhere else; but I cannot refuse you.' So she had them <b>properly</b> dressed, <b>made</b> a feast for them, and sent them back with a handsome present, to the great rejoicing of the whole camp. I hope the people of Calais loved the daughter to whom she gave birth soon afterwards, for her gentle mother's sake.|$|R
50|$|As {{the tragic}} {{situation}} continued to unfold, Peter was rushed into emergency surgery which was successful but still remained critically ill. Peter then married Leanne while in critical condition, with Carla watching on, in {{the fear that}} he wouldn't recover to wed her <b>properly.</b> John <b>made</b> an attempt to switch off Charlotte's life support machinery and nearly got caught by her parents and John passed himself off as Colin Fishwick (David Crellin), who died during a heated argument with John and Charlotte back in July. John later got his wish when doctors declared Charlotte as brain dead.|$|R
40|$|The term {{meta-analysis}} {{refers to}} the quantitative combination of data from independent trials. Where the result of such combination is a descriptive summary {{of the weight of}} the available evidence, the exercise is of undoubted value. Attempts to apply inferential methods, however, are subject to considerable methodolo-gical and logical difficulties. The selection and quality of the trials included, population bias, and the specification of the population to which inference may <b>properly</b> be <b>made</b> are problems to which no satisfactory solutions have been proposed. Insightful quantitative description ought not to differ materially from inferential conclusions; where discrepancies exist the inferential techniques should be regarded with extreme caution...|$|R
