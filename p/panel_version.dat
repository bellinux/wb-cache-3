50|$|One Saab innovation, {{inspired}} by the company's roots in aeronautics, was the 'Black Panel' feature (available on S or SE models only), which extinguished most instrument panel lights {{at the touch of}} a button on the SID, to eliminate distraction from dash lights during night driving. While active, this feature permitted darkened instruments to re-illuminate themselves when they required driver attention - if say, the engine speed increased alarmingly or if the fuel level should drop below 15 L. This feature was later renamed 'Night Panel' in Saab 9-3 and Saab 9-5 models. In the later Night <b>Panel</b> <b>version,</b> the speedometer is only illuminated up to the 87 mph/140 km/h mark. The remainder of the scale will only be illuminated if the speed of the car exceeds 84 mph/135 km/h.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{empirical evidence}} which links the exchange rates to monetary {{variables in the}} newly entered ten EU members and Turkey. Using the <b>panel</b> <b>version</b> of various cointegration tests, we find a long-run relationship between nominal exchange rate and monetary variables such as monetary differential, output differential, interest rate differential and price differential. In addition, empirical evidence shows that our error-correction framework of the out-of-sample predictability outperforms random walk after two years. ...|$|E
30|$|We also {{employ the}} two Moon and Perron (2004) type pooled tests {{utilizing}} the PANIC residuals to estimate a bias-corrected pooled PANIC autoregressive estimator, and a <b>panel</b> <b>version</b> of the Sargan–Bhargava (1983) statistic using the sample {{moments of the}} residuals without the need to estimate the pooled autoregressive coefficients. A great advantage of the PANIC pooled statistics of Bai and Ng (2010) {{is that there is}} no need for least squares linear detrending that could give rise to a fall in statistical power.|$|E

To do this, the individual ADF test, its <b>panel</b> <b>versions</b> and theMinimumLMunit root test with structural break(s) were employed. While the former tests found more favorable evidence of an integrated process, after controlling for structural breaks only Uruguay seems to be integrated. Thus, in general, the consumption-income ratio was diagnosed as a stationary process, {{as suggested by the}} relative income hypothesis, the habit persistence model, the permanent income hypothesis and the life cycle hypothesis...|$|R

30|$|Finally, {{we assumed}} that panel {{attrition}} might explain decreasing deprivation when the worst-off individuals leave the panel (H 6). As {{can be seen from}} Table  1, the estimates β̂_ 1 remain significant if weights that control for non-response (including attrition) (Version A (A 1) estimates) or a balanced <b>panel</b> (<b>Version</b> A 2 estimates) are used. Therefore, {{to the extent that the}} weights (and balancing) control for the assumed selection process, the possibility can be ruled out that panel attrition drives decreasing deprivation.|$|E
40|$|Pure time series-based tests fail to find {{empirical}} support for monetary exchange rate models. In this paper we apply pooled time series estimation on a forward-looking monetary model, resulting in parameter estimates which are {{in compliance with the}} underlying theory. Based on a <b>panel</b> <b>version</b> of the Engle and Granger (1987) two-step procedure we find that the residuals of our pooled estimated model are stationary. This indicates that on a pooled time series level there is cointegration between the exchange rate and the macroeconomic fundamentals of this monetary model...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{empirical evidence}} linking {{the current account}} balance to its major determinants such as exchange rate, interest rate and budget balance in 7 of the EU member countries: Bulgaria, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Portugal and Spain. Using the <b>panel</b> <b>version</b> of various cointegration tests, we find a long-run relationship between the current account and its determinants. The long-run coefficient of the interest rate is found statistically significant in all estimation techniques. On the other hand, weak evidence is found {{for the existence of}} the twin deficit hypothesis...|$|E

40|$|Use of {{next-generation}} sequencing to detect somatic variants in DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues poses {{a challenge for}} clinical molecular diagnostic laboratories because of variable DNA quality and quantity, and the potential to detect low allele frequency somatic variants difficult to verify by non–{{next-generation sequencing}} methods. We evaluated somatic variant detection performance of the MiSeq and Ion Proton benchtop sequencers using two commercially available panels, the TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel and the AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot <b>Panel</b> <b>Version</b> 2. Both the MiSeq-TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel and Ion Proton-AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot <b>Panel</b> <b>Version</b> 2 were comparable in terms of detection of somatic variants and allele frequency determination using DNA extracted from tumor tissue. Concordance was 100 % between the panels for detection of somatic variants in genomic regions tested by both panels, including 27 variants present at low somatic allele frequency (< 15 %). Use of both the MiSeq and Ion Proton platforms in a combined workflow enabled detection of potentially actionable variants with importance for patient diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment in 49 % (305 / 621) of cases. Overall, a combined workflow using both platforms enabled successful molecular profiling of 96 % (621 / 644) of tumor samples, and provided an approach for verification of somatic variants not amenable to verification by Sanger sequencing (< 15 % variant allele frequency) ...|$|E

Estimation of the long-run parameters is performed with a pooled mean group method, with short run heterogeneous dynamics.

40|$|This latter test is {{equivalent}} to the well-known pooled t test proposed by Levin et al. (2002, Journal of Econometrics 108, 1 [...] 24), and its power depends only on the mean of the local-to-unity parameters. This implies that it has the same power against homogeneous and heterogeneous alternatives with the same mean autoregressive parameter. We then compare these tests to a <b>panel</b> <b>version</b> of the Sargan-Bhargava (1983, Econometrica 51, 153 [...] 74) statistic for a unit root and the common point-optimal test of Moon et al.
