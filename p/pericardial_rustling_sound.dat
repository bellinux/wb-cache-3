60|$|Duane's {{strained}} {{ears were}} pervaded by a slight <b>rustling</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|R
60|$|There was a <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> as the Captain {{slipped his}} doublet on.|$|R
60|$|The {{talking and}} {{laughter}} ceased. My own strained ears were pervaded by a slight <b>rustling</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|R
60|$|There was {{a moment}} of silence--followed by the <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> of her dress, {{approaching}} us along the corridor.|$|R
60|$|Listening attentively, {{they could}} hear a low <b>rustling</b> <b>sound,</b> with {{sometimes}} a faint crack as of a breaking stick.|$|R
6000|$|How blank!--but whence this <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> [...] Which, all too long, {{the pair}} hath chased! --A dancing leaf is close behind, [...] 1819.|$|R
60|$|A gentle <b>rustling</b> <b>sounded</b> at the window: Henrietta looked up, but {{the sight}} deserted her fading vision, as Ferdinand seized with {{softness}} her softer hand, {{and pressed it}} to his lips.|$|R
60|$|We sat silent after that; out {{of doors}} the light began to stir among the leaves. There were all kinds of <b>rustling</b> <b>sounds,</b> {{as if the world}} were turning over in bed.|$|R
60|$|That night Sobber, Pell {{and their}} friends went to bed as usual. But hardly had they turned out the lights when they heard a curious <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> on the floor near the door.|$|R
40|$|Echolocation is {{a highly}} {{sophisticated}} sensory system for actively probing light-deficient environments. However, due to the stroboscopic and directional emission of the calls and the strong attenuation of ultrasonic frequencies, the space that can be probed by biosonar is limited both temporally and spatially. We hypothesised that this limitation will favour the opportunistic use of additional information for prey detection, such as prey-generated <b>rustling</b> <b>sounds,</b> and that bats thus exploit a much wider range of environ- mental information than previously believed. We tested this hypothesis in greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), whose echolocation is specialised {{for the detection of}} fluttering insects, but spatially strongly limited due to high call frequencies. We predicted that bats will react to prey-generated <b>rustling</b> <b>sounds</b> by steering their sonar beam towards the position of the sound for further biosonar-based evaluation. To present prey <b>rustling</b> <b>sounds</b> and monitor bat echolocation, we developed a spherical three loudspeaker - eight microphone array. Each loudspeaker was placed next to one microphone and was symmetrically surrounded by three other microphones. Bats were trained to perch in the centre of the spherical array. Per trial, we played back a <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> of a moth fluttering in vegetation from one of the loudspeakers, or alternatively phase-randomized or amplitude-inverted versions of the recordings to control for temporal and spectral cues. We recorded the bat’s echolocation behaviour simultaneously with all eight microphones for offline analysis of relative call intensity and thus call direction...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait {{till the}} moon comes out, {{and we shall}} see what it is," [...] whispered George, and, as he spoke, there came from the {{direction}} of the figure a <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> as of falling garments.|$|R
60|$|Her ladyship took {{no notice}} of the proposal; her {{attention}} remained fixed on the library door. The <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> stopped for a moment. The door was softly pushed open. The false Grace Roseberry entered the room.|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} the {{monologue}} a <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> was heard. It proceeded {{from the}} Baital, who was disengaging himself from the dead body in the bundle, and the burden became sensibly lighter upon the monarch's back.|$|R
6000|$|Again Saxon was drowsing, {{when the}} <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> was heard, this time closer. To her excited {{apprehension}} {{there was something}} stealthy about it, and she imagined a beast of prey creeping upon them. [...] "Billy," [...] she whispered.|$|R
60|$|She made no answer, only {{turned and}} opened her arms wide, then let them fall to her side again. Whilst I {{wondered}} what this signal of hers might mean, from the shadows about us came a strange, <b>rustling</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|R
60|$|He started, {{and both}} men {{tried to look}} at their ease as a stiff <b>rustling</b> <b>sounded</b> from the stairs. Then the door opened and a tall, stoutly-built old lady with white hair swept into the room and stood {{regarding}} them.|$|R
60|$|As {{the music}} ceased, with a soft, <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> the Elves spread their shining wings, and flew silently over the {{sleeping}} earth; the flowers closed their bright eyes, the little winds were still, for the feast was over, and the Fairy lessons ended.|$|R
60|$|At this juncture, a faint <b>rustling</b> <b>sound,</b> as of {{the advance}} of an army with banners, was heard. Silks, scarfs, and ribbons fluttered in the background. Presently, a bright {{squadron}} of fair ladies drew nigh, escorted by certain outriding gallants of Falmouth.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} get clear cotton <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> signal, which will be {{analyzed}} to provide information at a certain stage of fabric processing for developing cotton products, before analysis of the data, it {{is the need for}} de-noising processing. The two de-noising methods, the median filtering method and the wavelet method are proposed in this paper. Their principles and algorithms are described. The cotton sound signals are exposed to interference and influence of some kinds of noise signal in the process of the data measured. So in practical applications, the two de-noising methods are used to process cotton <b>rustling</b> <b>sound.</b> The results of the process show the methods of processing the cotton sound signal are effective. The clear signal is getting to the next research...|$|R
60|$|Raising {{his rifle}} he opened fire upon the white foe. A struggling, <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> {{followed}} the shots. But {{whether it was}} the threshing about of wolves dying in agony, or the fighting of the fortunate ones over those shot, could not be ascertained in the confusion.|$|R
60|$|He {{crossed the}} floor carefully, {{stopping}} often to listen. At last {{he heard a}} <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> just ahead of him. His fingers tightened upon the revolver he carried in his right hand, by the barrel, clublike. Billy {{had no intention of}} making any more noise than necessary.|$|R
60|$|Then {{occurred}} the one thrilling {{adventure of}} this happy journey. In the darkest hour before dawn Mat awoke, heard a suspicious {{noise in the}} middle room, and asked if Lavinia was on the rampage again. No reply, and, listening, a low, rasping, <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> was heard.|$|R
50|$|This {{village is}} 45 km north of Port St Johns in East Pondoland. It {{developed}} {{from a military}} camp established in 1894, was surveyed in 1902 and administered by a village management board since 1932. The name is onomatopoeic, derived from the <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> of reeds in the wind.|$|R
60|$|The dining-room of {{the house}} was in a wing, and to get to it they had to pass through a pair of folding doors which were all but closed. As they did so all heard a {{peculiar}} <b>rustling</b> <b>sound,</b> but from whence it came they could not tell.|$|R
60|$|He did so, {{and was at}} once {{convinced}} that the man's ears had not deceived him. Although the night was perfectly still, and not a breath of wind was stirring, he heard a low <b>rustling</b> <b>sound,</b> {{like that of the}} wind passing through the dried leaves of a forest, in autumn.|$|R
40|$|DANCE THE DARK CHORUS ★★★½ Lucy Guerin Inc, Arts House ​Meat Market, North Melbourne ​Until October 12 The <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> {{should not}} be {{unexpected}} – and yet it is. It {{is the sound of}} heavy, brocade, floor-length skirts flapping against bare running legs as dancers dart en masse around a circle of light...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, half-hypnotised, {{the young}} girl ceased to struggle. Her face had the strangest {{expression}} of submission and defiance--a sort of pain, a sort of delight. So they sat full half a minute staring at each other's eyes. Hearing a <b>rustling</b> <b>sound,</b> they looked, and saw Bianca moving to the door. Cecilia, too, had risen.|$|R
60|$|When we {{had done}} all we could, we sat down, or at least I did, and waited. The night, I remember, was strangely still, only from the slopes {{on either side of}} our plateau came a kind of <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> which in fact was caused by the feet of Rezu's people, as they marched to {{surround}} us.|$|R
6000|$|Presently there came, not Dr. Hunter's tread, but a crisp, <b>rustling</b> <b>sound,</b> and the tap of high heels, and in {{the doorway}} stood, tall, erect, and terrible, Lady Belamour, with a blaze of wrath in her blue eyes, and {{concentrated}} rage in her whole form, while in accents low, but coming from between her teeth, she demanded, [...] "Miserable boy, what means this?" ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the gray}} of the {{deepening}} twilight Jonathan Zane sat alone. An owl hooted dismally {{in the dark}} woods beyond the thicket where the borderman crouched waiting for Wetzel. His listening ear detected a soft, <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> like the play of a mole under the leaves. A branch trembled and swung back; a soft footstep followed and Wetzel came into the retreat.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{our guide}} {{jumped up and}} loudly clapped his hands, which {{produced}} a curious effect--a short, sharp little shriek of terror from the busy multitude, followed by absolute stillness, every rat frozen to stone, which lasted {{for a second or}} two; then a swift scuttling away in all directions, vanishing with a <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> through the dead grass and wood.|$|R
60|$|A <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> {{near her}} at length {{caused her to}} open her eyes; before her stood a huge woman, almost a giantess, without any clothes save a lion's skin, which was thrown over her shoulders, while a dried snake's skin was plaited into her hair. In one hand she held a club on which she leaned, {{and in the other}} a quiver full of arrows.|$|R
60|$|How {{many more}} {{meanings}} {{of her own}} Lady Janet might have gone on enumerating, {{it is not easy}} to calculate. At her third sentence a sound in the library caught her ear through the incompletely closed door and suspended the next words on her lips. Horace heard it also. It was the <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> (traveling nearer and nearer over the library carpet) of a silken dress.|$|R
60|$|Dorn {{gradually}} {{grew more}} acutely {{sensitive to the}} many faint, <b>rustling,</b> whispering <b>sounds</b> in and near the dugout.|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves are}} thin and papery and {{resemble}} {{many forms of}} bamboo. They are very flexible and have a distinctive <b>rustling</b> <b>sound</b> when the wind blows that adds to their appeal. The foliage rises from the roots on thin wiry stalks. The leaf blades are green but many color variations exist. The papery texture keeps the foliage cool to the touch and often the surface is slightly puckered or rippled.|$|R
5000|$|After {{finishing}} the roof, all four performers take their places on chairs, light a campfire, and proceed to break small branches and twigs, {{starting with the}} larger pieces and proceeding toward the thinner ones [...] This process falls into ten phases, ending with a ritardando of clicking and <b>rustling</b> <b>sounds</b> resembling the [...] "very bright crackling of a fire". Throughout the movement, the ensemble playing should resemble that of a string quartet [...]|$|R
