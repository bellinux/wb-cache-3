40|$|Platinum single {{crystals}} were irradiated with fast electrons along various crystallographic {{directions to}} determine the anisotropy of the damage rate by resistivity measurements. The temperature dependence of the anisotropy was obtained by varying the irradiation temperature from 4. 5 K to 40 K and 400 K. The results were interpreted {{in terms of an}} anisotropy of the <b>threshold</b> <b>energy</b> for atomic displacement. The evaluation was done by a computer program which fitted a <b>threshold</b> <b>energy</b> profile to the measured damage rates. The effect of details of the <b>threshold</b> <b>energy</b> prof ile and the ef f ect of electron beam spreading on the anisotropy of the damage rate was studied. Two models, which may explain qualitatively the effect of temperature on the defect production process, are discussed. The important results of this work are: 1.) The anisotropy of the damage rate in platinum increases with increasing temperature. 2.)

40|$|The {{relative}} <b>threshold</b> dissociation <b>energies</b> of {{a series}} of flavonoid/transition metal/auxiliary ligand complexes of the type [MII (flavonoid − H) auxiliary ligand]+ formed by electrospray ionization (ESI) were measured by energy-variable collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) in a quadrupole ion trap (QIT). For each of the isomeric flavonoid diglycoside pairs, the rutinoside (with a 1 – 6 inter-saccharide linkage) requires a greater CAD energy and thus has a higher dissociation threshold than its neohesperidoside (with a 1 – 2 inter-saccharide linkage) isomer. Likewise, the <b>threshold</b> <b>energies</b> of complexes containing flavones are higher than those containing flavanones. The monoglycoside isomers also have characteristic <b>threshold</b> <b>energies.</b> The flavonoids that are glycosylated at the 3 -O- position tend to have lower <b>threshold</b> <b>energies</b> than those glycosylated at the 7 -O- or 4 ′-O- position, and those that are C- bonded have lower <b>threshold</b> <b>energies</b> than the O- bonded isomers. The structural features that substantially influence the <b>threshold</b> <b>energies</b> include the aglycon type (flavanone versus flavone), the type of disaccharide (rutinose versus neohesperidose), and the linkage type (O- bonded versus C- bonded). Various computational means were applied to probe the structures and conformations of the complexes and to rationalize the differences in <b>threshold</b> <b>energies</b> of isomeric flavonoids. The most favorable coordination geometry of the complexes has a plane-angle of about 62 °, which means that the deprotonated flavonoid and 2, 2 ′-bipyridine within a complex do not reside on the same plane. Stable conformations of five cobalt complexes and five deprotonated flavonoids were identified. The conformations were combined with the point charges and helium accessible surface areas to explain qualitatively the differences in <b>threshold</b> <b>energies</b> for isomeric flavonoids...|$|R
