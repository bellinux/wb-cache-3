40|$|Methylxanthines, namely caffeine, {{theobromine}} and theophylline {{are found}} in several beverages and food products such as coffee, cocoa, tea and cola drinks. These substances can provide benefits to humans but also prove harmful mainly when consumed in high amounts. However, the beneficial and deleterious effects of methylxanthines are controversial in research findings, largely because of inconsistencies within research conducted and factors associated within studies. For instance, some authors have reported methylxanthines could have potential antioxidant activity under physiological conditions but opposing studies do not support these claims. Factors that influence the effects of methylxanthines include age, gender and health status of the individual. In addition to these, other factors such as doses, consumption of drugs or <b>pharmaceuticals,</b> <b>alcohol</b> and tobacco habits and diet {{also play a role}} in methylxanthine effects and metabolism. Therefore, our review is to provide a clearer understanding of the beneficial/adverse effects of methylxanthines in humans.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} has been to assess the {{characteristics}} of acute poisoning deaths in Poland {{over a period of time}} 2009 – 2013. Material and Methods: The analysis was based on the data obtained from the patient records stored in toxicology departments in 6 cities – Łódź, Kraków, Sosnowiec, Gdańsk, Wrocław and Poznań. Toxicological analyses were routinely performed in blood and/or urine. Major toxic substances were classified to one of the following categories: <b>pharmaceuticals,</b> <b>alcohol</b> group poisonings (ethanol and other alcohols), gases, solvents, drugs of abuse, pesticides, metals, mushrooms, others. Cases were analyzed according to the following criteria: year, age and gender of analyzed patients, toxic substance category and type of poisoning. The recorded fatal poisonings were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases. Results: The record of 261 deaths were retrospectively reviewed. There were 187 males (71. 64 %) and 74 females (28. 36 %) and the male to female ratio was 2. 52. Alcohol group poisonings were more frequently responsible for deaths in men compared to all poisonings, 91. 1 % vs. 71. 6 %, respectively (p < 0. 05), and pharmaceutical agents were more frequently responsible for deaths in women, 47. 4 % vs. 28. 4 %, (p < 0. 05). Methanol was the most common agent in the alcohol group poisonings, accounting for 43. 75 % (N = 49), followed by ethylene glycol, 39. 29 % (N = 44), and ethanol, 16. 96 % (N = 19). Conclusions: Epidemiological profile data from investigation of poisoning deaths in Poland may be very useful for the development of preventive programs.

40|$|Methyl esters and amides are {{valuable}} compounds in fine chemicals synthesis, with methyl esters used in flavourings and perfumes, while amides {{are used in}} many industries from polymers to <b>pharmaceuticals.</b> <b>Alcohols</b> are desirable starting materials {{as they can be}} sustainably sourced, however both methyl ester synthesis from alcohols and methanol, and amide synthesis from alcohols and amines conventionally involve wasteful processes using stoichiometric quantities of metal oxidants and other toxic reagents. In this project a greener synthesis route was developed and studied for each reaction, employing plug flow reactors with a heterogeneous catalyst in the form of Au/TiO 2 and green oxidants and solvents. A continuous flow methyl ester synthesis route from benzyl alcohol and methanol with hydrogen peroxide over Au/TiO 2 was studied, Scheme 1. Using experimental observations, a reaction model was constructed in Berkeley Madonna (a differential equation solver), to draw conclusions about the reaction pathway, including the role of H 2 O 2 and factors determining product selectivity. This model was then fitted to experimental data to determine reaction parameters such as rate constants and activation energies. Initial attempts at amide synthesis over Au/TiO 2 in a single plug flow reactor were unsuccessful, therefore a system with two reactors in series was built and characterised. In the first reactor of the tandem system, the alcohol to aldehyde transformation took place over Au/TiO 2 with oxygen gas, while the second reactor was for amide synthesis from the aldehyde and amine using H 2 O 2, Scheme 2. After initial screenings of process conditions, solvents and catalysts to maximise product yields for each step, both stages of the reaction were studied separately for the reaction of benzyl alcohol and morpholine. As with the methyl ester synthesis above, a reaction model was developed in Berkeley Madonna and fitted to experimental data. Finally amide synthesis from decanol and morpholine was carried out and compared to the benzyl alcohol process. Open Acces...|$|R

Appointed Lon Nol's deputy, {{he proceeded}} to organise a series of economic denationalisation and deregulation measures in opposition to Sihanouk's previous policy of state control of import and export, banking, and production of <b>pharmaceuticals</b> and <b>alcohol.</b> Sirik Matak even visited Hanoi secretly {{to find out what}} could be done to remove Vietnamese troops from Cambodian soil. He was infuriated when he was shown documents signed by Sihanouk agreeing to the establishment of Vietnamese bases and the transport of Vietnamese supplies through Cambodian ports. On March 12, 1970, while Sihanouk was on a trip abroad, Sirik Matak canceled Sihanouk's trade agreements and Lon Nol demanded that all North Vietnamese and NLF troops leave Cambodia by dawn on March 15 (the deadline passed without any response from the Vietnamese). On March 18, Sirik Matak assisted Lon Nol in organising a vote of the National Assembly to depose Sihanouk as head of state. The pretext was given by a series of anti-Vietnamese riots - likely encouraged by the Prime Minister and his deputy - in front of the North Vietnamese embassy. Foreign media subsequently suggested that Sirik Matak, who continued as Lon Nol's deputy in the new government, was the real organisational force behind the coup; it was claimed that in order to finally convince Lon Nol, Sirik Matak had played him a tape-recorded press conference from Paris, in which Sihanouk threatened to execute them both on his return to Phnom Penh. It was even reported that Sirik Matak compelled Lon Nol at gunpoint to commit to deposing Sihanouk.|$|R

40|$|Primary fatty {{alcohols}} {{are present}} in all phyla, where they serve various unique biological functions, either in structural materials or biochemical compounds. Fatty alcohols and derivatives provided by living organisms are also important feedstock for the oleochemical and lubricant industries. Since they are biodegradable and generally non-toxic, {{they can also be}} used in the manufacture of cosmetics and <b>pharmaceuticals.</b> Fatty <b>alcohols</b> are produced by Fatty Acid Reductases (FAR), which catalyse the reductions of fatty acyl-CoA/ACPs. The reductions are conducted in two consecutive reactions; a fatty acyl-CoA/ACP is first reduced to a fatty aldehyde, which is then further reduced into a fatty alcohol. In prokaryotes, the two-step reduction has until now been considered to be catalysed by two different enzymes, while in eukaryotes it has been found that one enzyme carries out both reduction steps via an intermediate fatty aldehyde, which is thought not to be released during the reductions. This thesis presents data on the in vivo and in vitro characterisation of FARs from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtFARs) and Marinobacter aquaeolei VT 8 (Maqu_ 2220). Contrary to available literature, Maqu_ 2220 was found to catalyse both steps in the reductions of fatty acyl-CoA/ACPs into fatty alcohols. Thus, at least two biochemical pathways exist among prokaryotes for the reductions of activated fatty acyl chains to fatty alcohols, one of which is the above-identified activity in analogy with eukaryotic FARs. Characterisation of AtFAR 6, AtFAR 2 /MS 2 and the bacterial Maqu_ 2220 revealed that under in vitro conditions, intermediate fatty aldehydes were released and free fatty acids were observed, in addition to fatty alcohols produced as end-products. The in vitro characterisation of AtFAR 2 /MS 2 and AtFAR 6 showed that the ratio of fatty alcohol/fatty aldehyde produced by these enzymes depends strongly on chain length and saturation state of the substrates and substrate concentration. Both in vitro and in vivo data consistently showed that the highest activity of AtFAR 2 /MS 2 and AtFAR 6 is for the production of C 16 : 0 -alcohol from C 16 : 0 -CoA/ACP substrates. In a subsequent study, AtFAR 6 was found to be a chloroplast-localised FAR enzyme involved in production and accumulation of C 16 : 0 -alcohol within this organelle...|$|R

Method This study aims to compare and correlate the consumption estimates of <b>pharmaceuticals,</b> illicit drugs, <b>alcohol,</b> nicotine and caffeine from wastewater analysis and other sources of information. Wastewater samples were collected in 2015 from 8 different European cities over a one week period, representing a population of approximately 5 million people.

Although primarily designed for surviving Swiss tourists as well as relatives and acquaintances of the victims, the screening instrument was open to anyone who felt psychologically affected by this disaster. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the influences between self-declared increased substance use in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster, trauma exposure and current PTSD symptoms. METHODS: One section of the screening covered addiction related behavior. We analyzed the relationship between increased substance use, the level of PTSD symptoms and trauma exposure using multivariable logistic regression with substance use as the dependent variable. Included in the study were only subjects who reported being residents of Switzerland and the analyses were stratified by gender in order to control for possible socio-cultural or gender differences in the use of psychotropic substances. RESULTS: In women PTSD symptoms and degree of exposure enlarged the odds of increased <b>alcohol,</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> and cannabis use significantly. In men the relationship was more specific: PTSD symptoms and degree of exposure only enlarged the odds of increased pharmaceutical consumption significantly. Increases in alcohol, cannabis and tobacco use were only significantly associated with the degree of PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSION: The tsunami was associated with increased substance use.

The use of drugs is well integrated into the social, political, economic, and religious aspects of the American culture (79 : 35) (18 : 109). Historically, legal penalties against the possession or use of drugs has not dramatically discouraged people from using drugs (10 : 521). Traditional drug education efforts have also not been successful in decreasing drug use in this country (79 : 110 - 111, 119) (10 : 523). Most people use drugs {{as an attempt to}} either solve their personal problems or to structure their recreational time.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version {{is available from the}} APA via [URL] main aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate whether there is a significant long-term association between bullying at school and drug use later in life. A meta-analysis is presented based on results from major prospective longitudinal studies with available unadjusted and adjusted effect sizes. Results are based on thorough systematic searches of the literature across 19 databases and 63 journals. The unadjusted summary effect size suggests that youth who bully are at least twice as likely compared with non-involved students to use drugs later in life (OR = 2. 22, 95 % CI: 1. 60 – 3. 07). The adjusted summary effect size is markedly reduced to an OR of 1. 41 (95 % CI: 1. 20 – 1. 66) suggesting that a lot of variation in the final model is explained by other contributing factors, while bullying has a significant yet small effect over and above the contribution of these factors. Contributing factors include childhood risks falling within the individual, family and school domains that are significantly associated with both the predictor and the outcome. It is concluded that school bullying, drug use and other problem behaviors are intercorrelated, thus highlighting the need to create a meaningful holistic framework for the prevention of drug problems and other associated mental, emotional, and behavioral maladies. Implications for policy and practice arising from these findings are discussed. This study was supported by the British Academy and the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention.

40|$|Introduction and Aims: The harms {{associated}} with non-medical use of pharmaceutical opioid analgesics are well established; however, less {{is known about}} the characteristics and drug-use patterns of the growing and hidden populations of people using pharmaceutical opioids illicitly, including the frequency of pharmaceutical opioid injection. This paper aimed to undertake a detailed examination of jurisdictional differences in patterns of opioid use among a cohort of people who regularly tamper with pharmaceutical opioids in Australia. Design and Methods: Data were drawn from the National Opioid Medications Abuse Deterrence study. The cohort was recruited from New South Wales (NSW; n[*]=[*] 303), South Australia (SA; n[*]=[*] 150) and Tasmania (TAS; n[*]=[*] 153) to participate in face-to-face structured interviews collecting data on use of pharmaceutical opioids, benzodiazepines, other sedative drugs and illicit substances, as well as the harms {{associated with}} substance use. Results: TAS participants reported greater use and injection of certain pharmaceutical opioids (particularly morphine and methadone tablets), and limited heroin use, with lower rates of engagement in opioid substitution treatment, compared with NSW participants. NSW participants were more socially disadvantaged and more likely to report risky injecting behaviours and injecting-related injuries and diseases compared with SA and TAS participants. SA participants reported greater rates of pain conditions, greater use of pain-based services, as well as broader use of pharmaceutical opioids in regards to forms and route of administration, compared with NSW participants. Discussion and Conclusions: Distinct jurisdictional profiles were evident for people who tamper with pharmaceutical opioids, potentially reflecting jurisdictional differences in prescribing regulatory mechanisms and addiction treatment models [Peacock A, Bruno R, Cama E, Kihas I, Larance B, Lintzeris N, Hordern A, White N, Ali R, Degenhardt L.

Results: Heavy users of skin care products had a significantly lower BMI, higher level of physical activity, higher income, higher alcohol consumption, fewer children and a shorter total time of breastfeeding than non-users (p < 0. 001). There were significantly fewer current smokers and more former smokers among heavy users than among non-users (p < 0. 01). Current and earlier use of oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy or hormonal intra-uterine device were significantly more common among heavy users than among non-users (p < 0. 01). The use of skin care products was, to a moderate extent (weighted kappa 0. 52), consistent over time from 2003 to 2011, {{and as many as}} 91. 5 % of the women were classified into the same user group ± 1 category in 2003 and 2011. Conclusions: Heavy users of skin care products differ significantly from non-users on BMI, degree of daily physical activity, income, number of children, use of hormonal <b>pharmaceuticals,</b> smoking and <b>alcohol</b> consumption. Use of skin care products is common among women aged 41 – 76 years in Norway, and the use is consistent over time...|$|R
40|$|Background: Despite the {{numerous}} <b>pharmaceutical</b> applications of <b>alcohols</b> andglycols, the interspecies differences {{with respect to}} their pharmacokinetics (PK) arepoorly understood. The aim of this research was to use in-vivo and in-vitro approaches to compare and model the PK characteristics across various species. Methods: Appropriate published in-vivo studies (in different species) foralcohols and glycols were carefully selected. PK analysis was performed using (a) noncompartmental analysis and (b) compartmental modeling to estimate relevant dose-independent PK parameters. Next, six alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 1 -propanol, 1 -butanol, 1 -hexanol, and 1 -octanol), two glycols (ethylene glycol and propylene glycol) and one secondary alcohol (2 -propanol) were examined as in-vitro substrates for equine ADH using a UV spectrophotometric assay to evaluate the effect of molecular structure. Furthermore, in-vitro metabolism of ethanol and propylene glycol was also characterized in hepatic cytosolic fractions from rat, rabbit, dog and human and in-vitro in-vivo correlation for the hepatic disposition parameters was assessed. Finally, allometric scaling relationships for ethanol and propylene glycol PK parameters (in-vivo and in-vitro) were developed and validated. Results: Alcohols and glycols exhibited nonlinear PK due to saturable hepaticmetabolism in all species. The reported in-vivo data were well described by oneltwo compartment PK models with parallel saturable metabolism and first-order renalexcretion. In-vitro equine ADH experiments revealed differences in affinity andturnover between the substrates: Enzyme affinity (1 /Km) and in-vitro intrinsic clearance (CLintin-vitro) correlated positively with logP values; glycols showed lower CLintin-vitro values than straight-chain alcohols. In-vitro hepatic cytosol studies yielded acceptable in-vivo predictions for the metabolic clearance (CLmet) of ethanol and propylene glycol in the rat, dog and human, but not the rabbit. Vdss, Vmax, CLintin-vitro, CLmet scaled allometrically across species with similar powers for both ethanol and propylene glycol, and good agreement between in-vivo and in-vitro scaling was noted. The allometric scaling models gave excellent predictions when externally validated against in-vivo concentration-time data. Conclusions: The present research demonstrates. the successful application of amodeling-based approach to elucidate interspecies relationships for alcohols andglycols, compounds which exhibit nonlinear PK and mainly low hepatic extractionbehavior. The in-vitro experimental systems have been used successfully forcharacterizing alcohol/glycol metabolism and predicting in-vivo disposition...|$|R
40|$|Background: Drowning deaths {{constitute}} {{a significant proportion}} of unnatural deaths globally. In Sweden and other high-income countries, drowning deaths have decreased. This study investigates the epidemiology and current trends of unintentional, intentional, and undetermined drowning deaths with emphasis on the presence of alcohol and other drugs. Methods: During an 18 -years period, 5, 125 drowning deaths were autopsied in Sweden. Data on cases including toxicological analysis on <b>alcohol,</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> drugs, and illicit drugs were obtained from the National Board of Forensic Medicine. Results: During the study period, the annual incidence of drowning deaths in Sweden was 3. 1 / 100, 000 inhabitants and decreased on average by about 2 % each year (p< 0. 001). The highest incidence was found among males and in middle/older age groups. The incidence increased 3 % for each year of age. Children/adolescents (<= 18 years) constituted 5 % of all drowning deaths. Of all drowned females in the study, 55 % (847 / 1, 547) committed suicide, which was a significantly higher proportion compared with males (21 %, 763 / 3, 578) (p< 0. 001). In total, 38 % (1, 656 / 4, 377) of tested drowned persons had alcohol in their blood and the mean concentration was 1. 8 g/l. In the unintentional drowning group, intentional drowning group, and the undetermined group, the proportion of alcohol positive was 44 %, 24 %, and 45 %, respectively. One or several psychoactive drugs were present in the blood in 40 % (1, 688 / 4, 181) of all tested persons and in 69 % (965 / 1, 394) of tested persons who died from suicidal drowning. The most common drug was benzodiazepines (21 %, 891 / 4, 181). Illicit drugs were detected in 10 % (82 / 854) of tested persons. Conclusion: Presence of alcohol and drugs were frequent and {{may have contributed to the}} drowning deaths. The incidence of drowning deaths significantly decreased during the study period. Males and the middle/older age groups had a higher incidence compared to females and children. Suicidal drowning was common especially among women. Alcohol and drugs are significant contributors in drowning deaths in Sweden and should be considered as part of a comprehensive prevention program...|$|R
