25|$|As the {{shoreline}} continued to move eastward, the 285-foot-thick (87 m) Death Canyon Limestone Member of the Gros Ventre Formation was {{laid down in}} clear water farther from shore. It consists of two thick beds of dark blue-gray limestone that are separated by 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 m) of shale. The Death Canyon contains abundant fossil of brachiopods and trilobites in some places. Following this the sea retreated to the west for a short time. The 220-foot-thick (67 m) Park Shale Member of the Gros Ventre Formation was deposited in the shallow muddy water resulting from this retreat. It is a gray-green shale that contains beds of <b>platy</b> limestone conglomerate along with fossils of trilobites and brachiopods. Underwater expanses of algae flourished in places on the sea bottom and built extensive reefs. Periodically shoal areas were hit by violent storm waves that tore loose <b>platy</b> fragments of recently solidified limestone and swept them into nearby channels where they were buried and cemented into thin beds of jumbled fragments called 'edgewise' conglomerate.

25|$|Crystal habit {{refers to}} the overall shape of crystal. Several terms are used to {{describe}} this property. Common habits include acicular, which described needlelike crystals like in natrolite, bladed, dendritic (tree-pattern, common in native copper), equant, which is typical of garnet, prismatic (elongated in one direction), and tabular, which differs from bladed habit in that the former is <b>platy</b> whereas the latter has a defined elongation. Related to crystal form, the quality of crystal faces is diagnostic of some minerals, especially with a petrographic microscope. Euhedral crystals have a defined external shape, while anhedral crystals do not; those intermediate forms are termed subhedral.|$|E

It has a crystalline structure which forms layers which can be split (delaminated) into very thin sheets (0.125 to 0.025mm. or thinner), while remaining stable when exposed to electricity).

It also has a high dielectric breakdown and is resistant to corona discharge. It is also stable when exposed to light, moisture and extreme temperatures. Mica is also chemically inert, dielectric, elastic, flexible, hydrophilic, insulating, lightweight, <b>platy,</b> reflective, refractive, resilient, and ranges in opacity from transparent to opaque.|$|E

40|$|Aim: Anaplasma <b>platys,</b> the causative {{agent of}} {{infectious}} canine cyclic thrombocytopenia, is a tick-borne pathogen that {{also has been}} implicated as potentially zoonotic. To provide molecular evidence on the multiple infections of A. <b>platys</b> variants in Philippine dogs. Materials and Methods: DNA fragments of A. <b>platys</b> from infected dogs in the Philippines were molecularly characterized. For screening, 25 dogs suspected to have canine anaplasmosis were tested using a 16 S rRNA-based nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Infection was confirmed by sequencing of positive amplicons. Second round PCR targeting a longer 16 S rRNA fragment was subsequently performed on the first round PCR amplicons of the positive samples. Further characterization using the heat-shock operon (groEL) gene was also performed on the A. platys-positive samples. Results: 10 16 S rRNA sequences were obtained and found 99. 6 - 100 % identical {{to each other and}} 99. 6 - 99. 7 % identical to the closest registered A. <b>platys</b> sequences. On the other hand, 36 groEL clone sequences were obtained and found to be 85. 1 - 99. 8 % identical with each other and 85. 0 - 88. 9 % identical to the closest previously registered A. <b>platys</b> sequences. Four dogs were found coinfected with 2 - 3 groEL variant sequences. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the detected A. <b>platys</b> in the Philippines may represent unique variants. Conclusion: A. <b>platys</b> variants were detected in Philippine dogs. Coinfection of different A. <b>platys</b> variants in dogs was also demonstrated.

The {{present study was}} designed to characterize A. patys strains in dogs from Palermo, Sicily, Italy, using a combination of PCR and sequence analysis of the 16 S rDNA, heat shock operon groESL and citrate synthase (gltA) genes. Results Blood was collected from 344 dogs (111 pet dogs, 122 pound dogs and 111 hunting dogs) during 2003 – 2005 in the Province of Palermo, Sicily, Italy. The prevalence of A. <b>platys</b> in dogs in Sicily, as demonstrated by PCR and sequence analysis of the 16 S rDNA, groESL and gltA genes, was 4 %. None of the samples were positive for A. marginale, A. centrale, A. ovis and A. phagocytophilum DNA. Three different gltA genotypes of A. <b>platys</b> were identified in dogs from Sicily. Two of the gltA sequences of Sicilian A. <b>platys</b> strains were different from sequences reported previously. However, one of the gltA, 16 S rDNA and groESL sequences were identical to the sequence of A. <b>platys</b> strains from other regions of the world characterized previously. Conclusion At least three different strains of A. <b>platys</b> were identified in dogs from Sicily by PCR and sequence analyses of the 16 S rDNA, groESL and gltA genes. The results reported herein suggested that {{genetic diversity}} of A. <b>platys</b> strains may be similar to A. ovis, but lower than the diversity reported for A. marginale and A. phagocytophilum. This lower genetic diversity may have resulted from restricted movement of infected hosts compared to A. marginale -infected cattle and/or the limited host range of A. ovis and A. <b>platys</b> as compared with A. phagocytophilum.
