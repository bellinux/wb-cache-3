5|$|An investigative {{journalist}} whose articles notably relate to Daredevil, and the Kingpin. During the film, {{he goes on}} to uncover a lot of information about the two. Pantoliano was cast in March 2002. Urich works for the New York Post, rather than the Daily Bugle as in the comics, because the film rights to the Bugle were held by Sony <b>Pictures</b> <b>at</b> that time.|$|E
5|$|Grant was on {{assignment}} in November 1963 to cover President John F. Kennedy's trip from Washington, D.C., to Dallas. One of his photographs made {{the front page}} of the November 22 edition of the Morning News; a copy is believed to be the last thing Kennedy ever signed. Grant also would make several <b>pictures</b> <b>at</b> Parkland Memorial Hospital within minutes after Kennedy's motorcade arrived following the shooting in Dealey Plaza.|$|E
5|$|Born to a music-loving family, Ravel {{attended}} France's premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire; he was {{not well}} regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal. After leaving the Conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity, incorporating elements of baroque, neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz. He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, Boléro (1928), in which repetition {{takes the place of}} development. He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky's <b>Pictures</b> <b>at</b> an Exhibition is the best known.|$|E
50|$|He co-produced The Yard Sale, {{which won}} Best <b>Picture</b> <b>at</b> the San Diego Latino Film Festival, and The Little Match Makers, which won Best <b>Picture</b> <b>at</b> the San Diego Indie Fest in 2011.|$|R

5|$|Cinematographer Roger Deakins {{discussed}} {{the look of}} the film with the Coens during pre-production. They told him that they wanted some parts of the film to have a real and contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, to have a very stylized look. Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals. The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose Modest Mussorgsky's <b>Pictures</b> <b>at</b> an Exhibition. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece.|$|E
5|$|Development for X-Men {{began as}} far back as 1984 with Orion <b>Pictures.</b> <b>At</b> one point James Cameron and Kathryn Bigelow were in discussions. The film rights went to 20th Century Fox in 1994 and various scripts and film {{treatments}} were commissioned from Andrew Kevin Walker, John Logan, Joss Whedon, and Michael Chabon. Singer signed to direct in 1996, with further rewrites by Ed Solomon, Singer, Tom DeSanto, Christopher McQuarrie and Hayter in which Beast and Nightcrawler were deleted over budget concerns from Fox. X-Men marks the Hollywood debut of actor Hugh Jackman, a last-second choice for Wolverine, cast three weeks into filming. Filming took place from September 22, 1999 to March 3, 2000, primarily in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Haynes and Leary {{published}} the magazine Strange V.D., which featured photos of abnormal medical ailments, coupled with fictitious, humorous {{explanations for the}} diseases. After being caught {{with one of these}} <b>pictures</b> <b>at</b> work, Haynes left the accounting firm and moved to Southern California. Leary, at the time one semester shy of his degree, dropped out of college and followed Haynes. After a brief period spent selling homemade clothes and linens emblazoned with Lee Harvey Oswald's image, the pair returned to San Antonio, and launched the band that would eventually become Butthole Surfers.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, former {{warehouse}} {{workers and}} lottery winners Calvin (Calvin Tenner) and Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) approach Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) asking for their jobs back {{as they made}} a bad investment in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals. Darryl accepts them back and shows them around the warehouse and introduces them to new foreman Val (Ameenah Kaplan). Val's boyfriend, Brandon (Jerry Minor), is also there with her and notices the blatant compliments that Darryl gives to Val. Brandon then tells Darryl off which he responds to by just simply walking away. Later, Darryl and his daughter, Jada, are taking <b>pictures</b> <b>at</b> the family portrait studio; Val joins them and holds Darryl's hand.|$|E
5|$|On 25 March 1925, John Logie Baird {{was able}} to {{demonstrate}} the transmission of moving <b>pictures</b> <b>at</b> the London department store Selfridges. Baird's device relied upon the Nipkow disk and thus {{became known as the}} mechanical television. It formed the basis of experimental broadcasts done by the British Broadcasting Corporation beginning 30 September 1929. However, for most of the twentieth century televisions depended upon the cathode ray tube invented by Karl Braun. The first version of such a television to show promise was produced by Philo Farnsworth and demonstrated to his family on 7 September 1927. After World War II, the experiments in television that had been interrupted were resumed, and it also became an important home entertainment broadcast medium.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} between April 16, 1991 and September 27, 1991, using a mix of fixed sets and on-location footage. The production suffered {{from a lack of}} available set space because of shortages; the Starfleet Headquarters set was actually built a few blocks away from Paramount <b>Pictures</b> <b>at</b> the Hollywood Presbyterian Church. Meyer copied a technique used during filming of Citizen Kane, where the filmmakers let the set fall into darkness to save money on construction. The film was shot in Super 35 instead of anamorphic format, because of the former's greater flexibility in framing and lens selection, larger depth of field, and faster lenses.|$|E

5|$|With the LSO, he {{recorded}} Modest Mussorgsky's <b>Pictures</b> <b>at</b> an Exhibition and Night on Bald Mountain, Prokofiev's Symphony No. 5 and Lieutenant Kijé Suite, and Shostakovich's Symphony No. 9. With the Philharmonia, {{he recorded}}, among other things, Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, Tchaikovsky's Variations on a Rococo Theme and Theme and Variations from Suite No. 3, and Dvořák's Symphonic Variations. With the BBC, he also recorded Rachmaninoff's Symphony No.3, Handel's Water Music, which he also recorded with the RPO, Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5, Mendelssohn's A Midsummer Night's Dream incidental music, Humperdinck's overture to Hänsel und Gretel, {{and one of}} Britten's best known works, The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1946, RLPO; 1958, BBC). Sargent narrated and conducted the accompanying Instruments of the Orchestra, an educational film produced by the British government. He also conducted Britten's Simple Symphony with the RPO.|$|E
