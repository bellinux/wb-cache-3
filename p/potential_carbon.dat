25|$|Scientific {{research}} {{done in the}} Great Western Woodlands has estimated that currently there are ~950 million tonnes of carbon stored in the vegetation and soils of the region. Carbon that is stored in natural ecosystems such as woodlands {{is referred to as}} ‘Green Carbon’. Green Carbon is stored in both living and dead plant matter and in soils. Managing natural ecosystems, and the carbon they store, is believed to be crucial in a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change. Large and intense fires are identified as the most significant threat to green carbon stocks in the region. With better management, it is estimated that an additional 600 million tonnes of carbon could be stored in the region. This is equivalent to four times Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions for 2008. To maximise the <b>potential</b> <b>carbon</b> stored in the Great Western Woodlands requires that further degradation of the land be avoided, as well as restoring currently degraded ecosystems back to full maturity.|$|E
