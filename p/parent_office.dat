50|$|However, by {{this time}} the band had gained some {{critical}} praise in the United Kingdom, thanks in part to leading disc jockey John Peel, and this led EMI's <b>parent</b> <b>office</b> in London to invite the group to record their next album at the world-famous Abbey Road Studios. However the rejection of the Mutant album left the band with no new material, and when they arrived in London they discovered that EMI were expecting the line-up that had recorded the first LP. Rudd hastily wrote a number of new songs, but to complete the LP they were forced to fall back on Rudd's back-catalogue, recording new versions of several Spectrum/Murtceps songs. The resulting album, Rock'n'Roll Scars, was mixed by famous EMI recording engineer Geoff Emerick, who had worked with The Beatles.|$|E

40|$|Existing {{literature}} has identified domestic {{restrictive monetary policy}} and deteriorating funding conditions as the predominant factors explaining the increase in net interoffice accounts of global banks, that is, the net liabilities of <b>parent</b> <b>offices</b> due to their related foreign offices. The purpose {{of this research is}} twofold. Firstly, it quantifies the responsiveness of net interoffice accounts to variations in different types of domestic funding. Secondly, the paper assesses whether the relationship between net interoffice accounts and domestic policy-steered rates depends on cross-sectional differences in the funding structure of global banks. Using US banks' balance sheets data collected by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, the results highlight the importance of domestic repo borrowings in explaining net interoffice accounts, especially for larger banks during the crisis. On the other hand, a negative relationship between policy rates and net interoffice accounts is observed only for those global banks with a relatively higher share of repo borrowings...|$|R
