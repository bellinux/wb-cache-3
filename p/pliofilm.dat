5000|$|Plastic wrap, {{cling film}} (UK), cling wrap, food wrap, or <b>pliofilm</b> {{is a thin}} plastic film {{typically}} used for sealing food items in containers to keep them fresh {{over a longer period}} of time. Plastic wrap, typically sold on rolls in boxes with a cutting edge, clings to many smooth surfaces and can thus remain tight over the opening of a container without adhesive. Common plastic wrap is roughly 0.5 Thousandth of an inch (12.5 μm) thick. The trend has been to produce thinner plastic wrap, particularly for household use (where very little stretch is needed), so now the majority of brands on shelves around the world are 8, 9 or 10 μm thick.|$|E
40|$|A reanalysis of the <b>Pliofilm</b> cohort was {{conducted}} incorporating six additional years of follow-up information {{gathered by the}} National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and {{a new set of}} exposure estimates developed recently. The distribution of individual worker exposures calculated with the Paustenbach exposure estimates was compared to those derived using two earlier sets of job-, plant-, and year-specific exposure estimates. A traditional standardized mortality ratio analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model were used to investigate the impact of these exposure estimates and the NIOSH updated information on evaluation of benzene's leukemogenicity. There were no additional cases of multiple myeloma or any indication of increased incidences of solid tumors. The data added in the update did not greatly modify the estimated relative risk of all leukemias associated with benzene exposure but confirmed previous findings that occupational exposure only to very high concentrations had leukemogenic potential. Leukemia has not been observed in anyone who began employment in <b>Pliofilm</b> production after 1950. Neither the Paustenbach nor the Crump exposures gave dose-response estimates as steep as that resulting from the Rinsky exposures...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{the risk of}} developing acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and multiple myeloma in a cohort of workers exposed to benzene. The results were used to show the importance of taking specificity of disease into consideration in causation analysis. METHODS [...] Data were derived from a cohort of workers employed at two Goodyear plants in Ohio in the manufacture of <b>Pliofilm.</b> Based on data in the <b>Pliofilm</b> study, several papers that examined the relation between exposure to benzene and leukaemia (all cell types combined) have been published. In the current analyses based on updated data in the study, standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were calculated for AML and multiple myeloma by cumulative exposure to benzene. The results based on AML were compared with those for leukaemia (all cell types combined) published previously. RESULTS [...] An exposure response relation was shown between cumulative exposure to benzene and AML. No increased risk of AML was detected for cumulative exposure to benzene below 200 ppm-years (SMR 0. 91). Above 200 ppm-years, risk of AML rose drastically; reaching a significant SMR of 98. 37 for > 400 ppm-years. For multiple myeloma, no relation with exposure to benzene was detected. CONCLUSION [...] Analysis specific to AML shows the importance of taking specificity of disease into consideration in causation analysis. This investigation shows that previous analyses based on all leukaemia cell types combined have incorrectly set the estimated threshold too low, and have underestimated risk above the threshold. Current regulatory policies that rely on previous analyses based on all leukaemia cell types combined should be re-examined...|$|E
40|$|This report updates {{the risk}} {{assessment}} by Crump and Allen for benzene-induced leukemia {{that was based}} on a cohort exposed to benzene in the manufacture of <b>Pliofilm.</b> The present study derives new risk estimates using data from follow-up through 1987 (whereas the earlier assessment only had follow-up available through 1978) and uses new exposure information for this cohort developed by Paustenbach et al. that accounts for a number of factors that were unknown or not fully evaluated in earlier exposure assessments. There was a significant excess of acute myelocytic or acute monocytic leukemia (AMML) (8 - 10 observed, 1. 61 expected) in this cohort, and this end point also exhibited a strong dose-response trend. No other types of lymphatic or hematopoietic cancer were clearly linked to benzene exposure. Quantitative risk estimates were robust with respect to whether AMML or all leukemia was being modeled. They were also robust with respect to whether the Paustenbach et al. or Crump and Allen exposure estimates were used (differences in risk estimates of no greater than 2 -fold) as long as linear dose-response models were applied. However, whereas the Crump and Allen exposures predicted a linear dose response, the Paustenbach et al. exposures predicted a quadratic dose response. This departure from linearity was borderline significant (p= 0. 08). Estimates of additional lifetime from 45 years of occupational exposure (lifetime exposure) to 1 ppm derived using the Paustenbach et al. exposure matrix and best-fitting (quadratic) models ranged from 0. 020 to 0. 036 per thousand, whereas corresponding estimates based on a linear dose response ranged from 1. 6 to 3. 1 per thousand.

The development of French IAQGs has been on-going since 2005 in the framework of the National Environment and Health Action Plan (NEHAP, 2004 - 2008). According to toxicological and epidemiological data, benzene inhalation leads to acute and chronic effects. For long-term exposure, haematological effects and leukaemia have been observed in the <b>Pliofilm</b> cohort. Benzene is classified as carcinogenic for humans and its genotoxic effects have been demonstrated. Considering non carcinogenic effects and available toxicological reference values for benzene, the IAQG of 10 micro g. m- 3 is proposed to protect the general population for long-term exposure. To protect from carcinogenic effects, the proposed IAQGs are based on WHO's potency slope factor: 2 and 0. 2 micro g. m- 3 respectively associated with an excess lifetime risk of 10 - 5 and 10 - 6...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} recent {{risk assessments}} for benzene and observes {{a number of}} inconsistencies within the study and consistencies between studies that should effect the quantitative determination of the risk from benzene exposure. Comparisons across studies show that only acute myeloid leukemia (AML) {{is found to be}} consistently in excess with significant benzene exposure. The data from the <b>Pliofilm</b> study that forms the basis of most quantitative assessments reveal that all the AML cases came from only one of the three studied plants and that all the benzene exposure data came from the other plants. Hematological data from the 1940 s from the plant from which almost all of the industrial hygiene exposure data come do not correlate well with the originally published exposure estimates but do correlate well with an alternative set of exposure estimates that are much greater than those estimates originally published. Temporal relationships within the study are not consistent with those of other studies. The dose-response relationship is strongly nonlinear. Other data suggest that the leukemogenic effect of benzene is nonlinear and may derive from a threshold toxicity...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{and chronic}} {{exposure}} to benzene vapors poses {{a number of}} health hazards to humans. To evaluate {{the probability that a}} specific degree of exposure will produce an adverse effect, risk assessment methods must be used. This paper reviews much of the published information and evaluates the various risk assessments for benzene that have been conducted over the past 20 years. There is sufficient evidence that chronic exposure to relatively high concentrations of benzene can produce an increased incidence of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Some studies have indicated that benzene may cause other leukemias, but due to the inconsistency of results, the evidence is not conclusive. To predict the leukemogenic risk for humans exposed to much lower doses of benzene than those observed in most epidemiology studies, a model must be used. Although several models could yield plausible results, to date most risk assessments have used the linear-quadratic or conditional logistic models. These appear to be the most appropriate ones for providing the cancer risk for airborne concentrations of 1 ppb to 10 ppm, the range most often observed in the community and workplace. Of the seven major epidemiology studies that have been conducted, there is a consensus that the <b>Pliofilm</b> cohort (rubber workers) is the best one for estimating the cancer potency because it is the only one with good exposure and incidence of disease data. The current EPA, OSHA, and ACGIH cancer potency estimates for benzene are based largely on this cohort. A retrospective exposure assessment and an analysis of the incidence of disease in these workers were completed in 1991. All of these issues are discussed and the implications evaluated in this paper.

40|$|Significant benzene {{exposure}} {{has historically}} {{been associated with the}} development of a host of hematological disorders in humans and animals. In particular, benzene is known to cause disturbances of the peripheral blood, aplastic anemia and cancer of the lymphohematopoietic system. In 1928, the first modern report of an association between cancer and benzene exposure was published. This case report was followed by additional reports from around the world. In most instances, ailments resulted from long term, high level exposure to benzene found in glues, and through accidental industrial spills. Throughout the 19602 ̆ 7 s and 19702 ̆ 7 s, case reports accumulated linking benzene exposure to hematological cancers, particularly among leather workers in Turkey and Italy. At the time, only qualitative measures of benzene exposure were often available and most exposure information was based upon short term grab samples and subjective symptoms. However, this situation changed drastically in the mid- 1970 s, when the first report was published on a little known industry that manufactured rubber hydrochloride, also known as <b>Pliofilm.</b> This clear film product was made from natural rubber latex and processing utilized benzene in multiple stages. It appeared from the outset that there were an unusually large number of acute leukemia cases in this cohort of workers. Since that time, multiple follow-up evaluations of the same cohort have attempted to refine the benzene exposure of these workers. Benzene has subsequently been classified as a human carcinogen by several regulatory bodies and the allowable 8 hour time-weighted average has been lowered to 1 ppm. In pursuing the goal of protecting workers, regulatory bodies utilize a linear extrapolation, or no threshold dose, approach to cancer causation. This methodology assumes that every exposure brings an incremental rise in risk. In this work, the linear extrapolation methodology is tested utilizing the criteria proposed by Sir Bradford Hill. The Hill Criteria are used to critically evaluate the weight of evidence for a threshold dose that can cause hematological cancer in humans following benzene exposure. This evaluation revealed that there is sufficient evidence for a threshold dose and that linear extrapolation is designed to protect, not predict disease...|$|E
