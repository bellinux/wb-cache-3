5|$|Moncton {{was placed}} on the Trans-Canada Highway network in the early 1960s after Route 2 was built along the {{northern}} <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. Later, the Route 15 was built between the city and Shediac. At the same time, the Petitcodiac River Causeway was constructed. The Université de Moncton was founded in 1963. This institution became an important resource in the development of Acadian culture in the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{pictorial}} {{composition of}} the painting is constructed upon two pyramidal structures. The <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large mast on {{the left of the}} canvas forms the first. The horizontal grouping of dead and dying figures in the foreground forms the base from which the survivors emerge, surging upward towards the emotional peak, where the central figure waves desperately at a rescue ship.|$|E
5|$|The size of glaciers on Mount Rainier has fluctuated {{significantly}} in the past. For example, during the last ice age, from about 25,000 to about 15,000years ago, glaciers covered most of the area now {{within the boundaries of}} Mount Rainier National Park and extended to the <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present Puget Sound Basin.|$|E

5|$|As of 2014, {{the well}} {{can still be}} seen locked inside a red-brick {{enclosure}} with a steel gate, and its geothermal heat can be felt outside the building. Some plastic chairs, pails and mini-tubs kindly donated by visitors are stored at the <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compound, which has a makeshift shed in one corner. A caretaker, paid by Mindef, {{takes care of the}} place to ensure its overall cleanliness, but there is no toilet on location.

5|$|At Parken Stadium, {{where the}} final {{was to be}} played, the police erected iron fencing outside to {{separate}} the Arsenal and Galatasaray fans as a precaution. UEFA also requested that fences be put up around the <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pitch. The riots did not spread to the stadium, although there {{was an attempt to}} pull down the fences by fans heading towards the Arsenal area of the stadium before police stopped them.|$|E
25|$|Interspersed {{in various}} uplands {{and along the}} {{northern}} and western <b>perimeters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deep chernozems are mixtures of gray forest soils and podzolized black-earth soils, which together occupy much of Ukraine's remaining area. All these soils are very fertile when sufficient water is available. However, their intensive cultivation, especially on steep slopes, has led to widespread soil erosion and gullying.|$|R
2500|$|Viète {{obtained}} his formula {{by comparing}} <b>the</b> areas <b>of</b> regular polygons with [...] and [...] sides inscribed in a circle. The first {{term in the}} product, , is <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> areas of a square and an octagon, the second term is <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> areas of an octagon and a hexadecagon, etc. Thus, the product telescopes to give <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> areas <b>of</b> a square (<b>the</b> initial polygon in the sequence) to a circle (<b>the</b> limiting case <b>of</b> a -gon). Alternatively, the terms in the product may be instead interpreted as ratios <b>of</b> <b>perimeters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same sequence <b>of</b> polygons, starting with <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>perimeters</b> <b>of</b> a digon (<b>the</b> diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle, counted twice) and a square, <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>perimeters</b> <b>of</b> a square and an octagon, etc.|$|R
25|$|In 1616, Louis XIII of France gave a {{regiment}} <b>of</b> Swiss infantry <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Gardes suisses (Swiss Guards). The new regiment had <b>the</b> {{primary role}} <b>of</b> protecting <b>the</b> doors, gates and outer <b>perimeters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various royal palaces. In {{its early years}} this unit was officially a regiment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line, but it was generally regarded as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maison militaire du roi de France.|$|R
5|$|Before 1914, a cycling track {{ran around}} the <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pitch where regular cycling {{meetings}} were hosted as well as athletic events. Aside from football-related uses, the stadium has seen various concerts staged along with other sporting events including boxing matches and international rugby league and rugby union matches. In 1999, the last ever final of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup took place at Villa Park. Villa Park also hosted the 2012 FA Community Shield, as Wembley Stadium was in use for {{the final of the}} Olympic football tournament.|$|E
5|$|Bowes Castle was {{a medieval}} castle {{in the village}} of Bowes in County Durham, England. Built within the <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Roman fort of Lavatrae, the early timber castle on the site was {{replaced}} by a more substantial stone structure between 1170 and 1174 on the orders of Henry II. A planned village was built alongside the castle. Bowes Castle withstood Scottish attack during the Great Revolt of 1173-74 but was successfully looted by rebels in 1322. The castle went into decline and was largely dismantled after the English Civil War. The ruins are now owned by English Heritage and run as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Acurad system {{employed}} a patented double shot piston design. The {{idea was to}} use a second piston (located within the primary piston) to apply pressure after the shot had partially solidified around the <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> casting cavity and shot sleeve. While the system was not very effective, it did lead the manufacturer of the Acurad machines, Ube Industries, to discover {{that it was just}} as effective to apply sufficient pressure at the right time later in the cycle with the primary piston; this is indirect squeeze casting.|$|E
25|$|For Helms, the {{potential}} conflict became manifest {{with regard to}} his 1973 testimony about secret CIA activity during 1970 in Chile, ordered by President Nixon. At some point, <b>the</b> recorded facts <b>of</b> Helms's testimony ostensibly moved to territory outside <b>the</b> <b>perimeters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previously prevailing quiet and confidential understandings with Congress, and entered an arena in which new and different rules applied: those of transparency.|$|R
50|$|At {{some time}} between 180 and 225 CE the Romans built the {{defensive}} London Wall around <b>the</b> landward side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. The wall was about 3 km long, 6 m high, and 2.5 m thick. The wall would survive for another 1,600 years and define <b>the</b> City <b>of</b> London's <b>perimeters</b> for centuries to come. <b>The</b> <b>perimeters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present City are roughly defined by <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient wall.|$|R

5|$|Marine General Rathvon M. Tompkins, {{commander}} of the 3rd Marine Division, {{has pointed out that}} had NVA actually intended to take Khe Sanh, North Vietnamese troops could have cut the Combat Base's sole source of water, a stream 500 meters outside the <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> base. Had they simply contaminated the stream, the airlift would not have provided enough water to the Marines. Marine Lieutenant General Victor Krulak seconded the notion that there was never a serious intention to take the base by also arguing that neither the water supply nor the telephone land lines were ever cut by the North Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January, La Thanh Ton, an NVA {{lieutenant}} {{from the}} 325th Division, defected {{and laid out}} the plans for an entire series of North Vietnamese attacks. Hills 881 South, 861, and the main base itself would be simultaneously attacked that same evening. At 00:30 on 21 January, Hill 861 was attacked by approximately 300 North Vietnamese troops. The Marines, however, were prepared. The North Vietnamese infantry, though bracketed by artillery fire, still managed to penetrate the <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defenses and were only driven back after severe close-quarters combat.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 2–3 May, General Hasso von Manteuffel, {{commander}} of the III Panzer Army along with General Kurt von Tippelskirch, commander of the XXI Army, surrendered to the US Army.

5|$|Pakistani commandos {{raided the}} outer <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compound, {{blasting}} holes {{through the walls}} of the mosque to allow trapped women and children to escape. The assaults began shortly after 1:00am (20:00GMT) on 7 July and were met with heavy armed resistance. SSG Commander Lt. Col. Haroon-ul-Islam, who had been leading the operation, was wounded on 6 July and died in the hospital two days later. However, the commandos succeeded, and the boundary wall of Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa collapsed. Abdul Rashid Ghazi said they would not surrender and that they had sufficient ammunition and rations to last a month.|$|E
5|$|Started in 1743 and {{originally}} {{known as}} Temple Park, Castle Park is located {{to the south}} of the castle. Its original name derived from the Knights Templar, who used to own a manor in Warwick. Houses around the <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park were demolished and the land they stood on incorporated into the park. Attempts to make profits from the park in the late 18th century included leasing it for grazing, growing wheat, and keeping sheep.|$|E
5|$|The curve-shortening flow {{can be used}} {{to prove}} an isoperimetric {{inequality}} for surfaces whose Gaussian curvature is a non-increasing function of the distance from the origin, such as the paraboloid. On such a surface, the smooth compact set that has any given area and minimum perimeter for that area is necessarily a circle centered at the origin. The proof applies the curve-shortening flow to two curves, a metric circle and the boundary of any other compact set, and compares the change in <b>perimeter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two curves as they are both reduced to a point by the flow.|$|E
