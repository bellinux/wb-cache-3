40|$|Online {{retailers}} have associated {{the introduction of}} user-generated product reviews with increased customer sales and decreased product returns. For all of the perceived value conveyed by customer reviews, however, little effort has been directed towards leveraging user-generated content beyond a productcentric focus: customers first select a product in order to read from <b>prior</b> <b>users</b> of that product. In this paper, we integrate traditional information retrieval relevance ranking with database aggregation to model the knowledge within online product reviews and product descriptions. Customers search the knowledgebase of reviews by querying on specific needs or interests. The result is a customized ranking of products, a recommendation list, that is based upon and explained by the text of reviews written by <b>prior</b> <b>users</b> expressing similar needs or interests. We evaluate the approach using a knowledgebase of online reviews from Epinions. com and compare results to expert recommendations from Consumer Reports. 1...|$|R
40|$|Interactive {{segmentation}} {{is often}} performed on images {{that have been}} stored on disk (e. g., a medical image server) for some time <b>prior</b> to <b>user</b> interaction. We propose to use this time to perform an offline precomputation of the segmentation <b>prior</b> to <b>user</b> interaction that significantly decreases the amount of user time necessary to produce a segmentation. Knowing how to effectively precompute the segmentation <b>prior</b> to <b>user</b> interaction is difficult, since a user may choose to guide the segmentation algorithm to segment any object (or multiple objects) in the image. Consequently, precomputation performed <b>prior</b> to <b>user</b> interaction must be performed without any knowledge of the user interaction. Specifically, we show that one may precompute several eigenvectors of the weighted Laplacian matrix of a graph and use this information to produce a linear-time approximation of the Random Walker segmentation algorithm, even without knowing where the foreground/background seeds will be placed. Finally, we also show that this procedure may {{be interpreted as a}} seeded (interactive) Normalized Cuts algorithm. 1...|$|R

40|$|Background: Statins play an {{important}} role in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes. Several studies have reported low adherence with statins among patients with type 2 diabetes. Studies comparing discontinuation of statins compared with discontinuation of oral anti-diabetics within the same individuals before and after initiation of oral anti-diabetic drugs are not available. The aim of this study was to describe discontinuation among patients with type 2 diabetes prescribed statins prior to and after initiation of oral anti-diabetics and to compare statin discontinuation with discontinuation of oral anti-diabetics. Methods: We report an observational cohort study among patients initiating treatment with statins prior to or after initiation of oral anti-diabetics between 1999 and 2007. Patients were classified as starting statins prior to initiation (<b>Prior</b> <b>users)</b> or after initiation (After users) of anti-diabetics. Discontinuation was defined as an interval of 180 days or more between the theoretical end date of a statin/anti-diabetic prescription and the dispensing date of the next statin/anti-diabetic prescription. Results and Conclusions: We included 3323 starters with oral anti-diabetic drugs in our study; 2072 patients initiated statins in the period of observation. Discontinuation rates for statins were higher compared with oral anti-diabetics (52. 1 vs 15. 0 %). After users discontinued statin therapy more frequently compared to <b>prior</b> <b>users</b> (62. 8 vs 48. 2 %). Discontinuation of statins is higher compared with anti-diabetic discontinuation. Patients starting statins after the initiation of oral anti-diabetic treatment are more likely to discontinue treatment than patients who initiate statins before the start of oral anti-diabetics. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

Applying a basic OLS regression analysis, I show that mobile users tend to be heavier than non-mobile users irrespective of gender. Furthermore, I find that contemporaneous health on prior mobile use show higher weight levels compared to non- mobile <b>prior</b> <b>users.</b> Such findings provide evidence suggesting that mobile is ineffective in providing users with healthier outcomes...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Prior</b> <b>user</b> rights defense: If an individual/entity begins {{using an}} {{invention}} ('user') {{more than a}} year before a subsequent inventor files for a patent on the same invention, then the user will have the right to continue using the invention in the same way after the subsequent inventor is granted a patent, as long as the user did not derive the invention from the subsequent inventor. These <b>prior</b> <b>user</b> rights are limited in scope and transferability, and have limited applicability to patents held by universities.|$|E
50|$|Justice Hall, for the Court, {{states that}} “The patent in suit {{includes}} apparatus claims {{under which the}} respondent is entitled {{to the benefit of}} s. 58”, which implies that the prior use defence can only apply if the patent has claimed an apparatus. However, Ford’s apparatus did not come within the scope of the apparatus claims, yet Ford received the benefit of section 58, which implies that apparatus claims are not necessary for Ford to rely on section 58. The Court later states that “On the view that there is but one invention in the patent, Ford is entitled to rely on the specification as a whole to show that its machine is an “invention” for which the patent in suit was obtained.” Here, Justice Hall seems to conclude {{that as long as the}} patented invention covers Ford’s machine, the <b>prior</b> <b>user</b> defence is applicable. This interpretation is consistent with the view that apparatus claims are not necessary and that to rely on the <b>prior</b> <b>user</b> defence, Ford’s machine must merely be disclosed in the specification of the patent as an aspect of the claimed invention. Commentators have reached a similar conclusion.|$|E

30|$|In {{a number}} of {{randomized}} trials in infectious/inflammatory conditions such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, conducted over the past years, statins failed to improve outcome [25 – 27]. The majority of earlier observational studies, however, reported improved outcome of statin users with sepsis [7, 8]. In accordance, by using logistic regression analysis in the propensity-matched cohort, we found a survival benefit for <b>prior</b> statin <b>users.</b> The primary objective {{of this study was}} to compare the host response between <b>prior</b> <b>users</b> and non-users of statins in sepsis patients upon admission to the ICU. We measured 23 biomarkers, providing insight into systemic inflammatory reactions, activation of the endothelium and the coagulation system, and studied whole genome expression profiles in blood leukocytes, and compared these between sepsis patients who were on statin therapy prior to admission and those who were not, in both an unmatched and a propensity score-matched cohort. We defined sepsis using the 2001 consensus definition [17]; the vast majority of MARS patients included in this analysis had a SOFA score ≥  2 at ICU admission, which approximates the most recent consensus definitions for sepsis [28]. Our results strongly suggest that prior statin therapy does not influence the host response to sepsis in patients requiring intensive care.|$|R

50|$|Even under a first-to-invent system, the first-inventor-in-fact {{does not}} always obtain {{entitlement}} to a patent. If, for example, a first-inventor-in-fact maintained his invention as a trade secret for many years before seeking patent protection, he may be judged to have “abandoned, suppressed or concealed” the invention. Well-established patent law provides that an inventor who makes a secret, commercial use of an invention {{for more than one}} year prior to filing a patent application at the USPTO forfeits his own right to a patent. If an earlier inventor made secret commercial use of an invention, and another person independently invented the same technology later and obtained patent protection, then the trade secret holder could face liability for patent infringement. Many foreign patent regimes, on the other hand, protect <b>prior</b> <b>user</b> rights, which are often seen as assisting small entities that may lack the sophistication or resources to pursue patent protection. The American Inventors Protection Act of 1999 established a “first inventor defense,” but limited the defense to patents on “methods of doing or conducting business;” H.R. 2795 would have extended it to all subject matter.|$|E
