40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about porcine {{cysticercosis}} in Burkina Faso. We conducted a pilot study to estimate the prevalence of antigens of Taenia solium cysticercosis and to identify associated factors in pigs of three villages in Burkina Faso, selected to represent different <b>pig</b> <b>management</b> practices: one village where pigs are allowed to roam freely (Batondo), one village where pigs are penned {{part of the time}} (Pabre) and one village with limited pig farming (Nyonyogo). METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A clustered random sampling design was used. Data on socio-demographic characteristics (source of drinking water, presence of latrines in the household, type and number of breeding animals) and <b>pig</b> <b>management</b> practices were collected using a standardized questionnaire. Blood samples were collected from one pig per household to determine the presence of antigens of the larval stages of T. solium by the B 158 /B 60 Ag-ELISA. The associations between seropositivity and socio-demographic and <b>pig</b> <b>management</b> practices were estimated using logistic regression. Proportions of 32. 5 % (95 % CI 25. 4 - 40. 3), 39. 6 % (31. 9 - 47. 8), and 0 % of pigs, were found positive for the presence of circulating antigens of T. solium in Batondo, Pabre, and Nyonyogo, respectively. The results of the logistic regression analyses suggested that people acquire knowledge on porcine cysticercosis following the contamination of their animals. The presence of antigens in the pigs' sera was not associated with the absence of latrines in the household, the source of drinking water or the status of infection in humans but was associated with pig rearing practices during the rainy season. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that education of pig farmers is urgently needed to reduce the prevalence of this infection...|$|E
40|$|Taenia solium {{cysticercosis}} is {{a neglected}} tropical infection transmitted {{between humans and}} pigs. This infection is particularly common in areas where sanitation, hygiene and <b>pig</b> <b>management</b> practices are poor, and can sometimes lead to epilepsy in humans.

We conducted a pilot study in three villages: two villages where pig rearing and pork consumption are common (Batondo and Pabré) but with different <b>pig</b> <b>management</b> practices, and one village with limited pig farming and pork consumption (Nyonyogo). Blood tests were done on pigs and information on pig raising was collected from farmers.

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of total airborne bacteria, respirable endotoxins, ammonia, and respirable and inhalable particles were monitored in 160 piggery buildings in Australia between autumn 1997 and autumn 1999. The overall mean airborne bacteria, respirable endotoxins, ammonia (NH 3), and inhalable and respirable particle concentrations measured were 1. 17 × 105 cfu m- 3, 33. 1 EU m- 3, 3. 7 ppm, 1. 74 mg m- 3, and 0. 26 mg m- 3, respectively. The {{characteristics of the}} buildings and management systems used were documented {{at the time of}} sampling. A multifactorial general linear model (GLM) statistical procedure was used to analyze the effects of housing and management factors on the {{concentrations of}} the airborne pollutants. Both airborne bacteria and respirable endotoxin concentrations were affected by building classification (type), and respirable endotoxin concentrations were positively correlated with increasing humidity. The concentrations of airborne bacteria increased as the level of pen hygiene (cleanliness) decreased. The NH 3 concentrations were primarily affected by level of pen hygiene, building volume, <b>pig</b> flow <b>management,</b> and season. Building classification, <b>pig</b> flow <b>management,</b> season, building volume, ventilation rates, and temperature affected inhalable particle concentrations. Respirable particle concentrations were primarily affected by building classification, pen hygiene, <b>pig</b> flow <b>management,</b> season, ventilation rates, temperature, and humidity. These findings suggest that environmental improvement strategies (such as improved cleaning, ventilation, and temperature control) are likely to reduce airborne pollutant concentrations in pig buildings and in the environment, thus improving the health and welfare of both pigs and farm staff. ...|$|R

2500|$|Intensive piggeries {{have been}} {{increasingly}} criticized in preference of free range systems. Such systems usually refer {{not to a}} group-pen or shedding system, but to outdoor farming systems.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{smallholder}} farmer awareness in terms of good <b>pig</b> <b>management</b> and to identify serious management issues that should be readily changeable despite resources being limited in a rural setting. Methodology was a combination of questionnaire and observational surveys performed at pig-keeping households practising either confinement or a free-range system. Households were identified using the snowball method. A total of 120 pig-keeping households were included, of which 32 practised free-range systems and 88 confined their pigs. The observational survey included management practices and welfare assessment based on one pig from each of the 120 households. The results indicated that farmers were not aware of the basic requirements of pigs regardless of the production system practised. Water was often neglected and provided less frequently among those practising free-range. Pigs kept free-range also received treatment less frequently compared to those kept confined. Pigs were generally kept in poor conditions with risk of injury and without shelter from wind, rain, cold, heat, and sun. Welfare issues exist within both production systems, but issues within the confinement system could be easily eliminated with proper management. More knowledge on basic pig husbandry is required in the region and is essential for improving production. Educating farmers on the basic requirements for water and feed, alone, could vastly improve smallholder pig production. Education on <b>pig</b> <b>management</b> should therefore be a cornerstone in any research activity involving smallholder farmers in rural areas. [URL] Tropical Disease...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The ‘globalisation’ {{of plants}} and animals has been {{assisted}} by the move of international communities towards free trade and globalisation. Internationalisation of business and commensurate improved means and speed of transport has resulted in humans, animals and plants moving around the world, sometimes intentionally and in other cases as unintended hitchhikers. Pest animals introduced into new environments without natural balances can result in high costs to the economy into which they are introduced. Whilst prevention of entry of feral pests is desirable, their presence imposes a need for control. Resource allocation issues arise concerning whether eradication is desired, and if so, whether it is technically feasible and economically justified. If an eradication strategy is not selected, the question arises as to what level of management and which control instruments should be applied to pest populations. Feral pigs, a well-established feral pest in Australia introduced by early colonists, cause crop and environmental damage necessitating control costs to landholders and public land management agencies. The research problem addressed in this thesis was ‘What is the optimal control strategy, including instruments and intensity, for feral pigs in the horticultural cropping area of tropical north Queensland?’ In examining this research problem the following research questions are examined: ‘What is the cost of the sugar cane and banana crop damage caused by feral pigs in north Queensland’; ‘What are the current feral <b>pig</b> <b>management</b> techniques utilised by north Queensland banana and cane farmers and what are the success rates and costs associated with the management techniques utilised?’; ‘What is the damage cost to the environment caused by feral pigs?’; ‘Is regional eradication in north Queensland technically feasible and is it economically preferable to the maintenance expenditure incurred in living with the continued presence of feral pigs?’ and ‘What is the optimal control strategy for feral pigs by stakeholders in the horticultural crop areas in the Wet Tropics of north Queensland?’ Addressing the research problem and questions necessitated a literature review to comprehend the economic nature of the problem associated with feral pigs. This required examination of legislation that affects feral <b>pig</b> <b>management</b> and hence a landholder’s property rights. Obligations imposed and restrictions placed on landholders with respect to feral <b>pig</b> <b>management</b> have commensurate costs. Alternative modelling techniques and research approaches were assessed and it was decided that a form of cost-benefit analysis – estimation of the damage cost and control cost trade-off curve for alternative control strategies – would be utilised. This necessitated the development of the bio-economic simulation Feral <b>Pig</b> <b>Management</b> Model (FPMM). The types, nature and effectiveness of the control instruments and control tools and their respective costs were examined to determine the appropriate controls for feral <b>pig</b> <b>management</b> in the Wet Tropics of north Queensland. A case study in the Wet Tropics of horticultural crop damage and feral pig control involving 11 banana and 19 sugar cane farms was undertaken in conjunction with Department of Environment and Resource Management (DERM) officers. The horticultural crop damage from the case study farms was subsequently used, together with other data, to estimate damage for the Wet Tropics region {{with the aid of a}} Geographic Information System (GIS). For the broader socio-economic study, the damage that feral pigs cause to the environment was examined. To compare control strategies for feral pigs the author developed the FPMM using Excel and visual basic coding. The model was developed with continuing consultation with a number of people involved in feral <b>pig</b> <b>management,</b> and was presented to a number of feral pig experts for validation purposes, specifically with respect to model assumptions, most likely parameter values and alternative feral pig control strategies. The FPMM permitted alternative strategies to be ranked in terms of the lowest present value of damage and control costs combined, and the optimal strategy to be identified. A damage cost and control cost trade-off curve was developed permitting the optimal strategy to be identified. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to assess the affect changes to parameter values had on the strategy ranking. The analysis revealed that eradication of feral pigs on a national or regional level is highly unlikely to be achieved and would incur unacceptable costs. The highest ranking strategies – having the lowest present values of aggregate feral pig damage and control costs over a 20 -year planning horizon – involved regular control intervention, at a relatively high intensity. There are still substantial gaps in the information available to undertake a comprehensive socio-economic analysis of the feral pig and feral pest problem in general in Australia and various useful further research studies can be identified. For example, research into the carrying capacity of the Wet Tropics (feral pigs/km 2) and whether the carrying capacity changes from one season to the next is required. Carrying capacity is a critical factor because it creates a ‘ceiling’ or upper limit below which an unmanaged feral pig population would fluctuate. Many of the modelling issues that came to the fore in this research would be equally applicable to other vertebrate pests and could be applied in research on other pest mammals...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of farming landscapes in the Thames Valley from the Neolithic to the Roman period (4000 BCE â 410 CE). The focus is on the major domestic animal species, cattle, sheep and pig, and their roles in the agroecosystem, traced using carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios measured in collagen. The large dataset of faunal isotope values from a limited area, obtained from sites with extensive archaeological and environmental information, allowed a thorough characterisation of variability in isotope values, within and between species, sites, archaeological periods, and landscape regions. Isotope ratios in a flock of modern sheep showed less variability than archaeological assemblages. Linear mixed models were used to analyse variation in isotope values in 1490 archaeological samples from 23 sites. The pattern of change over time differed for cattle, sheep and pig, reflecting both wide-scale environmental change and changes in animal management. δ 13 C values of cattle and pigs reflected the loss of primary closed-canopy woodland. <b>Pig</b> <b>management</b> changed from an emphasis on woodland resources to a closer association with settlement and consumption of anthropogenic waste. Herbivore δ 15 N values probably reflect variations in the intensity of pasture use and association with arable farming. Climatic cooling since the post-glacial thermal maximum cannot explain these varied trajectories of change. Variation between sites in faunal isotope values was related to landscape regions. Faunal isotope values at individual sites were useful in site interpretation in the context of other evidence. The trend in pig and cattle δ 13 C values with time was widely found in the UK, as expected if it represents forest clearance. In the Neolithic, cattle management was similar to the UK at central and eastern European Neolithic sites, but <b>pig</b> <b>management</b> was different. Patterns of faunal isotope values and their changes over time, analysed in the context of archaeological and environmental information, can contribute to the interpretation of sites, and give a unique perspective on changes in farming practice and their effects on the landscape. </p...|$|E

Twelve PFGE types and nine STs, accounting for 34 and 41. 6 % of the isolates, respectively, were common between the two production systems with ST 854 dominating (18. 3 % of the isolates). Twenty-nine PFGE types and 25 STs were only found in isolates from organic farms, and 18 PFGE types and 16 STs from conventional farms. No significant differences were found in diversity despite the differences in rearing systems, except at the locus level for the glnA, gltA, and uncA genes. All isolates, regardless of their origin, carried the ceuE, iam, ciaB, and flaA genes and more than 95 % of the isolates carried the cadF and cdtABC genes.

40|$|Feral pigs (Sus scrofa) are {{declared}} {{as a major}} vertebrate pest in the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area (WTWHA) of North Queensland, Australia. However, stakeholders' {{perceptions of}} their effects did not necessarily match their reported pest status. Almost unanimously, the environmental costs of pigs {{were considered to be}} significant because most stakeholders believed that pigs diminished the values that they attached to the rainforest. Nonetheless, those public 'values' which pigs damaged, did not match the experts' or scientific perspectives on 'values' of the WTWHA. The socio-economic impacts of pigs had greatest perceptive variation among stakeholder groups, particularly among the local agriculture and tourism industries; and local residents. This was because feral pigs were valued either both as a resource and a pest, or neither a resource nor a pest. The main perceived costs associated with feral pigs were environmental, thus occurring in rainforest-dominant national parks. This resulted in feral <b>pig</b> <b>management</b> being seen as the responsibility of the government. Moreover, many stakeholders perceived that {{there was a lack of}} government action within national parks, and therefore, they were dissatisfied with the current management of feral pigs. Management plays a crucial role in reducing the conflicts between stakeholders and feral pigs, and the methods used to control the animal need to be socially acceptable and cost-effective. Most stakeholders preferred trapping, compared to fencing, hunting and poisoning, because it entailed socio-economic benefits, and was perceived to be humane and target specific. Poisoning (1080) was the least favoured method mainly owing to its perceived lack of target specificity. Levels of social acceptability of the methods, however, varied considerably with social factors such as the type of stakeholder group and their socio-demographics, as well as cognitive factors such as perceptions of the severity of the problems associated with feral pigs. Cost-effectiveness of the methods also varied, and trapping appeared to be the most cost-effective; however, simple reduction in numbers of pigs did not necessarily correspond to damage reduction; thus, cost-effectiveness based on population reduction was not an effective decision making tool in management. Feral <b>pig</b> <b>management</b> faces challenges in optimising socially acceptable and cost-effective control while accommodating various values of pigs held by different stakeholder groups. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Taeniasis and {{cysticercosis}} are two diseases {{caused by}} Taenia solium, a parasite transmitted {{between humans and}} pigs, leading to considerable economic loss and disabilities. Transmission of the parasite is linked to environmental and behavioural factors such as inadequate sanitation and hygiene, poor <b>pig</b> <b>management,</b> and consumption of infected pork. This study used implementation research method to design a health education intervention strategy for reducing T. solium infections in Burkina Faso, a country endemic for the parasite. Methods: Eighteen group discussions were conducted with 8 - 18 participants each in three villages. In addition, structured interviews were conducted among 4 777 participants and 2 244 pig owners, who were selected through cluster random sampling in 60 villages of three provinces of Burkina Faso. Both approaches assessed knowledge and practices related to T. solium. The information obtained was used to develop a community-adapted health education intervention strategy to control taeniasis and cysticercosis in Burkina Faso. Results: The group discussions revealed that participants had a poor quality of life due to the diseases as well as inadequate access to latrines, safe water, and healthcare services. In addition, {{it was found that}} pig production was an important economic activity, especially for women. Furthermore, financial and knowledge constraints were important limitations to improved <b>pig</b> <b>management</b> and latrine construction. The survey data also showed that open defecation and drinking unboiled water were common behaviours, enhanced by a lack of knowledge regarding the transmission of the parasite, perceived financial barriers to the implementation of control measures, lack of public sensitization, as well as a lack of self-efficacy towards control of the parasite. Nevertheless, the perceived financial benefits of controlling porcine cysticercosis could be emphasized by an education program that discourages open defecation and encourages drinking safe water. The final intervention strategy included a Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation Transformation (PHAST) approach, as well as a 52 -min film and an accompanying comic booklet. Conclusions: The main problem in the study communities regarding the transmission of T. solium cysticercosis is the random disposal of human faeces, which can be contaminated with parasite eggs. Prevention of open defecation requires the building of latrines, which can be quite problematic in economically challenged settings. Providing the community with the skills to construct durable latrines using low-cost locally available materials would likely help to resolve this problem.

Neither of these methods was expected to reduce bait selection or access by pigs.

Use of corn as a bait substrate effectively prevented bait-take by dingoes. Covering baits substantially reduced bait-take by other nontarget species and completely prevented nontarget bait-take when uncovered feed was provided simultaneously. The corn bait preparation was highly acceptable and accessible to feral pigs. We conclude that the methods evaluated here could enable the consideration of poison baiting as a viable method for controlling feral pigs in the World Heritage Area, where it has previously been unavailable...|$|E

This paper presents the combination of a dynamic simulation model and LCA to assess the environmental impact of a collective <b>pig</b> slurry <b>management</b> system. The model simulates the production of slurry, its stock level in storage facilities, its transport and application to crop fields, as well as the gaseous emissions occurring in these stages, under different management strategies and climatic conditions. Results from the combination of these approaches show the great variability of the agronomic and environmental performance of the collective slurry management system in relation to different organisational schemes, agronomic decisions and climatic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Ethnographical, {{historical}} and archaeological {{evidence suggests that}} a great diversity in pig husbandry may have existed in the past. However, such diversity remains difficult to document from traditional zooarchaeological methods and its study may necessitate the implementation of combined methodological approaches. An integrated dental analysis, combining kill-off patterns, traditional and geometric morphometrics, linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH), microwear and stable isotope (δ 18 O,δ 13 C, δ 15 N) data, has been performed on assemblages from the neighbouring sites of Düzen Tepe and Sagalassos (SW Turkey) dated to Classical-Hellenistic to Byzantine time periods. Results indicate a diachronic evolution in slaughter practices, and a gradual decrease in pig mean size from the Early-Middle Imperial to the Byzantine. The seasonality of physiological stressing events remains the same, although their intensity varies through time. During the Early Byzantine period (CE 450 – 700), <b>pig</b> demographic <b>management</b> is characterized by two birth seasons, and a great diversity in diet and scale of management occurred, from free-ranging pigs – whether or not given food supplement - to closely confined wellwatered and more omnivorous pigs. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Next Generation {{sequencing}} {{is producing}} ever larger data sizes with a growth rate outpacing Moore's Law. The data deluge has made {{many of the}} current sequenceanalysis tools obsolete {{because they do not}} scale with data. Here we present BioPig, a collection of cloud computing tools to scale data analysis and <b>management.</b> <b>Pig</b> is aflexible data scripting language that uses Apache's Hadoop data structure and map reduce framework to process very large data files in parallel and combine the results. BioPig extends Pig with capability with sequence analysis.

40|$|The study {{evaluated}} the energy performance of pig farming integrated with maize production in mechanized no-tillage system. In this proposed conception of integration, the swine excrement {{is used as}} fertilizers in the maize crop. The system was designed involving the activities associated to the <b>pig</b> <b>management</b> and maize production (soil management, cultivation and harvest). A one-year period of analysis was considered, enabling the production of three batches of pigs and two crops of maize. To evaluate the energy performance, three indicators were created: energy efficiency, use of non-renewable resources efficiency and cost of non-renewable energy to produce protein. The energy inputs are composed by the inputs and infrastructure used by the breeding of pigs and maize production, {{as well as the}} solar energy incident on the agroecosystem. The energy outputs are represented by the products (finished pigs and maize). The results obtained in the simulation indicates that the integration improves the energy performance of pig farms, with an increase in the energy efficiency (186 %) {{as well as in the}} use of the non-renewable energy resources efficiency (352 %), while reducing the cost of non-renewable energy to produce protein (&# 8209; 58 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are {{recognised}} on {{a global}} scale as a tantalising and delicious food source. But, they are also a major pest species and cause millions of dollars of destruction each year. Due to their negative effects on biodiversity, Regional Councils and Governing Bodies in New Zealand seek to control pig numbers. Nevertheless, stakeholder views and values have not been considered in the management process. Therefore, leaving local and national officials open for criticism and strong opposition from other stakeholders. The aim {{of this study is to}} provide the first insight into a community’s values to determine whether the harvest of wild pigs would be a potential threat or benefit to conservation. A series of semi-structured interviews was conducted with notable individuals from different stakeholder groups and their views and their values collected and analysed against the research objectives. There are several responses affirming or denying whether the harvest of wild pigs would potentially be a threat or a benefit to conservation. However, whilst the benefits (social, cultural, environmental, economic) for and against wild pigs in the environment are wide ranging, all stakeholders (Government, Iwi, Agencies, NGO’s, and the public) must express their views and reach a collective agreement to guide future wild <b>pig</b> <b>management...</b>|$|E
40|$|Nursery pigs {{are defined}} as newly weaned pigs {{adjusting}} to a solid-plant based diet after being weaned from a milk-based diet. Weaning has nutritional, environmental, social, and physiological impacts on the nursery pig. Nutrition is modified to accommodate changing needs of the nursery pig. The nursery pig diet is developed by adding highly digestible animal proteins to the standard corn-soybean meal swine diet. Development of the nursery diet improves pig performance but animal-based proteins can be expensive and do not address undigestible components of the plant-based ingredients. Addition of lower-cost animal proteins, addition of enzymes, and addition of acidifiers {{have the capability to}} improve nutrient utilization of corn-soybean meal diets by nursery pigs at a lower cost. This thesis consists of four chapters. Chapter one consists of a literature review examining nursery <b>pig</b> <b>management</b> and nutrition in the United States swine industry. Chapter two examines the effectiveness of independent addition of spray-dried blood plasma or spray-dried egg to improve nursery pig growth performance when added to the standard nursery diet. Chapter three examines the effectiveness of the independent and joint addition of α-galactosidase and citric acid to improve nursery pig growth performance when added to a corn-soybean meal diet. Chapter four summarizes the findings of Ch two and three and the implications of these findings for the swine industry...|$|E
40|$|Feral pigs (Sus scrofa) {{are a major}} {{vertebrate}} pest in Australia {{and have}} been {{commonly referred to as}} an environmental and agricultural pest. However, perceptions about pigs and their impacts may vary from person to person, particularly Aboriginal Australians, who have different cultural backgrounds and worldviews. Such variation in perceptions makes the pest status of pigs ambiguous. This paper illustrates Aboriginal rangers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of feral pigs and their impacts in the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area of North Queensland, Australia. There were differences in the values of feral pigs among Aboriginal communities, depending on the socio-economic context.

40|$|Between 1997 and 1999 a {{comprehensive}} survey of airborne pollutant concentrations within, and emissions from, 160 Australian piggery buildings was undertaken. The primary {{aim of the}} study was to model the concentrations and emissions of different airborne pollutants and thus identify potential reduction techniques. The main factors identified as significantly influencing airborne pollutant concentrations were building type, pen hygiene, <b>pig</b> flow <b>management,</b> seasons, building volume, ventilation airflow rate, air temperature, relative humidity, and farm size (as expressed by number of sows on site). These effects were included in comprehensive statistical models to explain the variation in measured concentrations and emission rates. The models developed were validated and fine-tuned using the ‘‘leave-one-out’’ cross-validation technique. This article details the validation technique used that was aimed to maximise the value of available experimental data and further improves the practicality of the models developed. The main result {{of the study was}} the development of an improved model. The study results, and the resulting prediction models, should help improve air quality in piggery buildings by providing decision makers with an awareness of the environmental conditions inside and outside of piggery buildings. In turn, that should lead to improvements in the health and welfare of pigs and piggery staff and the sustainability of the piggery operations...|$|R
