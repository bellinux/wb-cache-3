5|$|Salisbury, then a {{dormitory}} {{town to the}} north of Adelaide, became a defence centre; the shipyards at Whyalla began launching corvettes in 1941 just as Japan entered the war. All of these developments were done under Playford's watch, with most of the factories being built by the Department of Manpower and the South Australian Housing Trust. In Woodville in western Adelaide, a large <b>plant</b> <b>for</b> Actil cotton was built. The explosives factory at Salisbury was converted into an aerospace research facility after the war, as various companies worked on matters related to rocket testing at Woomera in the state's far north; the Salisbury complex became the second largest employer of South Australians for a period after the war. The munitions factory in the western suburb of Hendon was later converted into a <b>plant</b> <b>for</b> the electrical appliance firm Philips and at its peak employed more than three thousand people.|$|E
5|$|A 1988 {{field study}} found that most flowers of B.serrata opened at night, and {{recorded}} the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii), sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps), eastern pygmy possum (Cercartetus nanus), and bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) as nocturnal mammalian visitors and pollinators. Other mammals recorded eating the flowers include the grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus), little red flying fox (P. scapulatus) and common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis). Banksia serrata is a host <b>plant</b> <b>for</b> the larval and adult stages of the banksia jewel beetle (Cyrioides imperialis). Native bees and European honey bees visit the flowers.|$|E
5|$|Aker Stadion {{has been}} {{proposed}} used during the annual Moldejazz, Norway's largest jazz festival, but this has been rejected several times by the festival management. The issue was intensified in 2004, when a much smaller arena was used for a quickly sold-out Stevie Wonder concert. On 6 October 2007, StatoilHydro arranged a free concert at the stadium with Ane Brun and Röyksopp to celebrate the completion of their near-by processing <b>plant</b> <b>for</b> the gas field Ormen Lange. In a 2012 survey {{carried out by the}} Norwegian Players' Association among away-team captains, Ullevaal was found to be the league's fourth-best stadium, with a score of 4.27 on a scale from one to five.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of Estonian {{oil shale}} {{resources}} and mining possibilities intensified {{during the early}} 20th century while Estonia {{was part of the}} Russian Empire. Industrial development was under way in Saint Petersburg (known as Petrograd in 1914–24), but regional fuel resources were in short supply. A large shale oil extraction <b>plant</b> <b>for</b> processing Estonian oil shale was proposed in 1910. The outbreak of World War I, coupled with a fuel supply crisis, accelerated the pace of the research.|$|E
5|$|Attached to {{the dome}} is a three-storey {{rectangular}} building which houses the telescope control room, computer room, kitchen etc. Almost no human presence is required inside the dome, {{which means the}} environmental conditions can be kept very stable. As a result, the WHT obtains perfect dome seeing. This building also houses a detector laboratory and a realuminising plant. Because the WHT has the largest single mirror at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos, its realuminising plant has a vacuum vessel {{large enough to accommodate}} the mirrors from any other telescope on the mountain. As a result, all of the other telescopes at the observatory contract to use the WHT <b>plant</b> <b>for</b> their realuminising (with the exception of the Gran Telescopio Canarias, which has its own plant).|$|E
5|$|Brachychiton rupestris {{has been}} {{recorded}} as a host <b>plant</b> <b>for</b> the mistletoe species Dendrophthoe glabrescens. Insects hosted by the species include the pale cotton stainer bug, a pest of cotton crops, and the kurrajong leaf roller caterpillar that chews on the foliage and rolls individual leaves, within which it then pupates. Bottle tree scrub is a key habitat of the near threatened black-breasted buttonquail. Brachychiton rupestris can withstand bushfires and responds by flowering and putting forth new foliage afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Demand {{for heavy}} water {{increased}} in the early 1950s. The heavy water facility at Wabash, now renamed the Dana Plant by the Atomic Energy Commission, was reopened, and DuPont resumed production of heavy water in May 1952. The site was used a pilot <b>plant</b> <b>for</b> a new production process using hydrogen sulphide. The heavy water facility was closed again in early 1957. The facility, and a larger complex at the Savannah River Site had fulfilled its purpose, supplying heavy water for the plutonium production reactors at Savannah River.|$|E
5|$|For much of {{its early}} life, the school {{consisted}} only of Nathan Smith and a small class of students, operating in borrowed space at Dartmouth College. Students of Smith were educated as apprentices, and received a Bachelor of Medicine degree upon graduation. Like Dartmouth College as a whole, the medical school had continual funding shortages. As time passed, however, the popularity of both the medical instruction and the basic sciences taught at the school drew undergraduates and training physicians alike. Soliciting funds {{from the state of}} New Hampshire, Smith was able to obtain medical equipment and, by 1811, a dedicated physical <b>plant</b> <b>for</b> the school.|$|E
5|$|For {{security}} reasons, Groves wanted H. K. Ferguson {{to operate}} the new plant, {{but it was a}} closed shop, and security regulations at the Clinton Engineer Works did not allow trade unions. To get around this, H. K. Ferguson created a wholly owned subsidiary, the Fercleve Corporation (from Ferguson of Cleveland), and the Manhattan District contracted it {{to operate the}} <b>plant</b> <b>for</b> $11,000 a month. Operating personnel for the new plant were initially trained at the Philadelphia pilot plant. In August 1944, Groves, Conant and Fox asked ten enlisted men of the Special Engineer Detachment (SED) at Oak Ridge for volunteers, warning that the job would be dangerous. All ten volunteered. Along with four Fercleve employees, they were sent to Philadelphia to learn about the plant's operation.|$|E

5|$|In China, {{the tree}} of heaven has a long and rich history. It was {{mentioned}} in the oldest extant Chinese dictionary and listed in countless Chinese medical texts for its purported ability to cure ailments ranging from mental illness to baldness. The roots, leaves and bark are still used today in traditional Chinese medicine, primarily as an astringent. The tree has been grown extensively both in China and abroad as a host <b>plant</b> <b>for</b> the ailanthus silkmoth, a moth involved in silk production. Ailanthus has {{become a part of}} western culture as well, with the tree serving as the central metaphor and subject matter of the best-selling American novel A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{mitigate}} damage by camas pocket gophers to sensitive habitat, the Oregon Department of Transportation and the Institute for Applied Ecology trap and relocate the animals. At a site south of Philomath, Oregon, the IAE is working to protect a small but viable population of Kincaid's lupine (Lupinus sulphureus). This threatened flower is the primary host <b>plant</b> <b>for</b> the endangered Fender's blue butterfly (Icaricia icarioides fenderi), which is endemic to the Willamette Valley. The gophers are relocated to a nearby location distant from the lupines.|$|E

5|$|Most ground-living cacti {{have only}} fine roots, which spread {{out around the}} base of the <b>plant</b> <b>for</b> varying distances, close to the surface. Some cacti have taproots; in genera such as Copiapoa, these are {{considerably}} larger and of a greater volume than the body. Taproots may aid in stabilizing the larger columnar cacti. Climbing, creeping and epiphytic cacti may have only adventitious roots, produced along the stems where these come into contact with a rooting medium.|$|E

Lisa refuses the money and rips up the cheque. This causes Homer to have four simultaneous heart attacks. While in the hospital, Lisa apologizes to Homer for not accepting the money. He tells her that he understands what she did, but says that the $12,000 would have been a big financial help. Lisa replies that 10% of $120 million is actually $12 million. The hospital's public address system announces a code blue, signifying that Homer has entered cardiac arrest.|$|E
