40|$|Peripheral {{neuropathy}} is {{a leading}} complication of diabetes mellitus. Although its exact pathogenesis is not fully under-stood, chronic hyperglycemia and resultant microenvironmental changes in peripheral nerve tissue {{contribute to the development}} of neuropathy. 5 Therefore, intensive insulin therapy is needed to prevent such complications in patients with type 1 diabetes. However, intensive insulin therapy can lead to hypoglycemia, with patients sometimes developing hypoglycemic peripheral neuropathy. 8 Although experimental hypoglycemic peripheral neuropathy has been studied by using animal models of type 1 diabetes, few studies have included morphologic analyses. 4, 7, 14, 15 These studies showed that hypoglycemia causes axonopathy involving both degenerative and regenerative events. However, hyperglycemic peripheral neuropathy characterized by axonal atrophy has also been induced in diabetic animal models, such that the hyper-glycemic changes in these models were similar to hypoglycemic changes. Diabetic WBN/Kob rats spontaneously develop diabetic <b>peripheral</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy</b> characterized by segmental demy-elination and secondary axonal degeneration. 12, 13, 19 Morphologic changes in diabetic <b>peripheral</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy</b> are character-ized by various degenerative and regenerative changes in myelin sheath, demyelination, and a shift toward axons of smaller di-ameter. Therefore, WBN/Kob rats may be useful for distinguish-ing hyperglycemic from hypoglycemic changes. In addition, the threshold of hypoglycemia that induces the morphologic and clinical changes characteristic of peripheral neuropathy in diabet-ic animals remains unclear. 14 In the present study, we investigated the effects of short-term hypoglycemia on peripheral neuropathic changes in diabetic WBN/Kob rats...|$|E

40|$|Diabetic foot {{is one of}} {{the most}} common long term {{complications}} of diabetes. The risk of developing a foot ulcer is significantly increased when a patient presents with a callus. Callus develops due to various reasons, of which, the most important in people with diabetes is <b>peripheral</b> <b>neuropathy.</b> <b>Motor</b> <b>neuropathy</b> leads to deformity and sensory neuropathy causes lack of sensation, which results in persistent abnormal pressure on the foot. The cells of skin react to it by increasing keratinization and turns into a callus, which predisposes to foot ulceration. However, there is a lack of research in the field of callus. The link between hyperkeratosis, insulin and hyperglycaemia is not fully explored. There is also a lack of research on the relationship between genetic defects of hyperkeratosis, and the risk of developing a diabetic foot ulcer. There is scope for further research in this area, such as exploring whether development of callus is an individual risk factor, and whether glycaemic control or its treatment has any relationship with callus formation. The research around the genetic defects of hyperkeratosis may lead to identification of those, with diabetes, who may have increased risk of developing a foot ulcer...|$|R

We examined the short-term effects of hypoglycemia on neuropathic changes in these rats. Spontaneous diabetic WBN/Kob rats received insulin implants for 40 d and were divided into 3 groups based on blood glucose levels: group N, normoglycemic to slightly hyperglycemic (150 to 250 mg/dL); group H, hypoglycemic to slightly hyperglycemic (50 to 200 mg/dL); and group D, nontreated spontaneously diabetic (350 to 420 mg/dL). Conduction velocity was measured in sciatic–tibial motor nerves; these nerves also underwent qualitative and quantitative histomorphologic analysis. Conduction velocity was not significantly different in N, D, and H groups. Morphologic analysis of the sciatic nerves of H rats showed severe changes, including axonal degeneration, myelin distention, and endoneurial fibrosis, that tended to occur in large, myelinated fibers. N and D rats showed relatively mild changes. The degree and distribution of degenerated nerve fibers in H rats {{were significantly higher than}} in N and D rats. These results suggest that hypoglycemia of less than 50 mg/dL induced severe peripheral neuropathy. Hypoglycemic lesions differed from the hyperglycemic lesions in diabetic WBN/Kob rats.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Rodent {{models of}} {{diabetes}} develop a slowing of {{nerve conduction velocity}} and mild axonal atrophy, but generally lack overt de-generative neuropathy. Spontaneously diabetic Wistar Bonn Kobori (WBN/Kob) rats develop severe diabetic <b>peripheral</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy</b> with a slowing of nerve conduction velocity. We examined the effect of glycemic control, using insulin implant, on neuropathic changes in these rats. Animals were divided into 2 groups: WBN group (spontaneously occurring diabetes rats) and WBN + insulin group (spontane-ously occurring diabetes rats treated with insulin implants until 90 weeks of age). Conduction velocity was measured in sciatic–tibial motor nerves. These nerves also underwent qualitative and quantitative histomorphologic analysis. Mild to severe hyperglycemia (> 200 mg/dl) and glycosuria (> 100 mg/dl) were observed in the WBN group. In contrast, the blood glucose level of the WBN + insulin group fluctuated between normoglycemia (< 200 mg/dl) and hyperglycemia. Conduction velocity significantly decreased in WBN group compared with WBN + insulin group. Morphologic analysis of the sciatic and tibial nerves of WBN group showed severe changes, including axonal degeneration, myelin distention, endoneurial fibrosis and microangiopathy. Insulin treatment corrected these changes without microangi-opathy. These results suggest that insulin could decrease axonal atrophy and myelin distension of peripheral nerve in diabetic WBN/Kob rats. Observation of WBN/Kob rats revealed changes of axon, myelin and capillary caused by diabetes, thus indicating that this animal is a suitable model for investigating diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

40|$|Goldberg-Shprintzen {{megacolon}} syndrome (GOSHS) (OMIM 609460) {{is characterized}} by a combination of learning difficulties, characteristic dysmorphic features and Hirschsprung's disease. Variable clinical features include iris coloboma, congenital heart defects and central nervous system abnormalities, in particular polymicrogyria. GOSHS has been attributed to recessive mutations in KIAA 1279, encoding kinesin family member (KIF) -binding protein (KBP) with a crucial role in neuronal microtubule dynamics. Here we report on a 7 -year-old girl with GOSHS {{as a result of a}} homozygous deletion of exons 5 and 6 of the KIAA 1279 gene.

We conducted a dose-escalation/expansion phase 2, multicenter, single-arm study to determine the optimal dose of coltuximab ravtansine (SAR 3419), an anti-CD 19 antibody-drug conjugate, in this setting. Patients and Methods The dose-escalation {{part of the study}} determined the selected dose of coltuximab ravtansine for evaluation of efficacy and safety in the dose-expansion phase. Patients received coltuximab ravtansine induction therapy (up to 8 weekly doses); responding patients were eligible for maintenance therapy (biweekly administrations for up to 24 weeks). Three dose levels of coltuximab ravtansine were examined: 55, 70, and 90 mg/m 2. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR) and safety. Results A total of 36 patients were treated: 19 during dose escalation; 17 during dose expansion. One dose-limiting toxicity was observed at 90 mg/m 2 (grade 3 <b>peripheral</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy),</b> and therefore 70 mg/m 2 was selected for the dose-expansion phase. Five patients discontinued therapy due to adverse events (AEs). The most common AEs were pyrexia, diarrhea, and nausea. Of 17 evaluable patients treated at the selected dose, 4 responded (estimated ORR using Bayesian methodology: 25. 47 % [80 % confidence interval: 14. 18 - 39. 6 %]); DOR was 1. 94 (range: 1 - 5. 6) months.

RESULTS [...] A considerable overlap {{was evident in the}} titre of AGA to GM 1 in control and test sera. High antibody titres were most frequent in patients with multifocal <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy</b> with conduction block (MMNCB). Low AGA titre were observed in several patient groups.

Case presentation: Our patient has a clinical presentation that is typical for ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1 with no particularly severe phenotype. Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification analysis resulted {{in the identification of}} a homozygous deletion of all coding APTX exons (3 to 9). SNP array analysis using the Illumina Infinium CytoSNP- 850 K microarray indicated that the deletion was about 62 kb. Based on the SNP array results, the breakpoints were found using direct sequence analysis: c. - 5 + 1225 _* 44991 del 67512, p. 0 ?. Both parents were heterozygous for the deletion. Homozygous complete APTX deletions have been described in literature for two other patients. We obtained a sample from one of these two patients and characterized the deletion (156 kb) as c. - 23729 _* 115366 del 155489, p. 0 ?, including the non-coding exons 1 A and 2 of APTX. The more severe phenotype reported for this patient is not observed in our patient. It remains unclear whether the larger size of the deletion (156 kb vs 62 kb) plays a role in the phenotype (no extra genes are deleted). Conclusion: Here we described an ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1 patient who has a homozygous deletion of the complete coding region of APTX.

We show that neurons and Schwann cells express ganglioside- induced differentiation associated protein 1 (GDAP 1), which suggest that both cell types {{may contribute to the}} mixed features of the disease. GDAP 1 is located in the mitochondrial outer membrane and regulates the mitochondrial network. Overexpression of GDAP 1 induces fragmentation of mitochondria without inducing apoptosis, affecting overall mitochondrial ac- M tivity, or interfering with mitochondrial fusion. The mitochondrial fusion proteins, mitofusin 1 and 2 and Drp 1 (K 38 A), can counterbalance the GDAP 1 -dependent fission. GDAP 1 -specific knockdown by RNA interference results in a tubular mitochondrial morphology. GDAP 1 truncations that are found in patients who have CMT are not targeted to mitochondria and have lost mitochondrial fragmentation activity. The latter activity also is reduced strongly for disease-associated GDAP 1 point mutations. Our data indicate that an exquisitely tight control of mitochondrial dynamics, regulated by GDAP 1, is crucial for the proper function of myelinated peripheral nerves...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Functional {{reorganisation}} of {{the motor}} or sensory cortex has been demonstrated in animals after section of mixed peripheral nerves. Here functional changes in the motor cortex specifically after <b>peripheral</b> <b>motor</b> denervation in humans are investigated. METHODS: Functional MRI (fMRI) was used to study brain activation during a finger flexion-extension task in patients with a late onset, acquired pure <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy</b> (n= 6), contrasting results with those from patients with pure sensory neuropathies (n= 4) or healthy controls (n= 7). RESULTS: Increases in the extent of activation in the motor cortex both ipsilateral and contralateral to the hand moved {{were found in the}} patients with <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy.</b> The neuroanatomical localisation of the mixed contralateral sensorimotor cortex activation volume was more posterior for the patients with <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy</b> than for the healthy controls (mean difference, 12 mm, p< 0. 05). The pure sensory neuropathy group by contrast showed no change in the extent of activation relative to healthy controls and a trend for more anterior primary sensorimotor cortex activation (p< 0. 06). To test whether the increased activation volumes found in patients with <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy</b> were a result simply of factors such as increased effort with movement rather than the motor denervation, patients with hand weakness from inclusion body myositis (n= 4) were studied while making similar hand movements. No differences in either the numbers of significantly activated voxels or in their localisation were found relative to healthy controls (n= 10). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a novel demonstration that peripheral denervation (as distinguished from factors related to weakness) leads to functional reorganisation of the sensorimotor cortex in the adult brain. This suggests that adaptive responses to motor denervation involve the central as well as the peripheral nervous system...|$|R

A c. 923 C>T variant affecting an adjacent residue (p. Pro 308 Leu) produced a presynaptic neuromuscular junction defect and a dominant hereditary <b>motor</b> <b>neuropathy</b> in a second family. Characterization of the mutation homologous to the human c. 920 A>C variant in Drosophila Synaptotagmin revealed a dominant disruption of synaptic vesicle exocytosis using this transgenic model. These findings indicate that Synaptotagmin 2 regulates neurotransmitter release at human <b>peripheral</b> <b>motor</b> nerve terminals. In addition, mutations in the Synaptotagmin 2 C 2 B domain represent an important cause of presynaptic congenital myasthenic syndromes and link them with hereditary motor axonopathies.
