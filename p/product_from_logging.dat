40|$|Several {{methods are}} {{employed}} by the timber industry to try to restrict the flow of <b>products</b> <b>from</b> illegal or unsustainable sources into timber supply chains. The most commonly applied are systems of log marking and associated documentation that accompany the logs. However this system is open to falsification, particularly between the logging concession and the timber mill, {{where the majority of}} illegally logged timber enters the supply chain. This paper describes the development of a methodology to track a unique genetic fingerprint for single logs of merbau, Intsia palembanica (Leguminosae), a high-value Indonesian timber species, <b>from</b> <b>logging</b> concession to the mill, where the DNA profile of individual logs is difficult or impossible to falsify. We find that whilst the ability to extract DNA and amplify a PCR <b>product</b> <b>from</b> <b>logs</b> decreases slightly between forest concession (59. 2 %) and mill (41. 9 %) samples, that overall enough samples worked across the 14 microsatellite markers to provide an exact genotype match between forest and sawmill samples for 27 out of 32 logs. Furthermore for these 27 samples, the probability that an illegal log with an exact genotype match to forest samples had been substituted was very low (less than 10 – 5) for 18 samples, was low (between 10 – 2 and 10 – 4) for 7 samples and was moderate (10 – 1) for 2 samples. Improvements to DNA extraction and amplification success are recommended to improve this protocol, and there was a negative correlation between locus size and amplification success but a positive correlation with allele number. However, overall we propose that this methodology is now suitable for broad-scale industry application to track legally harvested timber and check for illegal substitutions along supply chains. A. J.

40|$|This {{case study}} {{investigated}} profitability {{of a small}} stand of fast-grown Eucalyptus nitens in Canterbury for sawn timber production. This stand was pruned and thinned and then harvested at 15 years old. An estimate of per-hectare log yields and diameters was made from the stand. Sample logs were sawn, dried and profiled, then products quantified. Log prices were estimated using the residual value method. Prices were summed for sawn <b>products</b> <b>from</b> each <b>log,</b> <b>from</b> which processing expenses and sawmill profit were deducted for an estimate of log value. In the absence of market prices for sawn E. nitens products empirical estimates of price were derived from market survey data. Predictive models were produced <b>from</b> estimated stand <b>log</b> yields along with predicted product revenues and processing costs <b>from</b> sample <b>logs.</b> These were used for estimating per-hectare <b>log</b> residual values <b>from</b> the case study stand trees. Financial returns to the grower were then calculated as discounted cash flows <b>from</b> the estimated <b>log</b> residual values per hectare, taking into account grower costs along with harvesting and transport costs. Best-practice processing methods were identified from the literature and applied as a productivity benchmark. Methods were developed with the view to standardising data across research efforts that seek to improve grade recoveries for E. nitens. A range of factors were investigated that potentially influenced E. nitens log residual value in this case study, including log diameter and log position. Outcomes included a reasonably favourable return on investment for the grower. However, this depended {{on a number of}} factors such as land price, distance <b>from</b> processor, <b>product</b> prices, grading methods, drying methods and level of sawmill profit. The application of contemporary best practice small-scale processing methods indicates that E. nitens has potential as a profitable plantation species for solid timber production...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{planning}} of how hardwood logs can be sawn to improve recovery of high-value lumber {{has always been}} hampered by the limited information provided by external defects, and whatever internal defects are eventually revealed on the cut log faces by the sawing pattern. With expanded markets, lower-quality <b>logs,</b> increased competition <b>from</b> non-wood <b>products,</b> social pressures to manage public lands for nontimber resources, and the reduced profit margin between log costs and lumber prices, the hardwood products industry has been exploring alternative means of improving value yield. The goal of this project is to provide science and technology-based methods and information that will benefit the hardwood products industry and related fields. Summary: Hardwood timber is a substantial economic staple in the Eastern United States. Primary hardwood processors there produce more than 10 billion board feet of sawn hardwoods annually. Most of their facilities are relatively small (< 10 MMBF/year) and are located in rural areas. To survive in a highly competitive marketplace and meet current and future consumer needs for hardwood products, sawmill operators must: (1) produce high quality and consistent <b>products</b> <b>from</b> current stocks of increasingly lower-grade timber, and (2) increase the value of each board sold. To manufacture the highest value <b>products</b> possible <b>from</b> hardwood <b>logs,</b> decisions made during the firs...|$|R
40|$|International audienceContext Improved and {{cost-efficient}} {{predictions of}} detailed <b>product</b> recovery <b>from</b> <b>logging</b> operations may increase efficiency and improve value chains based on modern cut-to-length harvesting (CTL). • Aims The {{objective of this}} study was to investigate and evaluate the use of individual tree data estimates from two inventory techniques: (a) established airborne laser scanner inventory (ALS case) and (b) traditional field inventory (BAU case) for predicting product recovery in a Swedish case study. • Methods Statistics from previous harvester production files within the region were used to generate realistic levels of simulated stem defects. Bucking simulations were performed to optimise log products according to stem profiles, stem defects, and an operational price list expressing the demand of the industry customer. All simulation results at the stand level were compared to operational harvester production data that were used to provide an accurate measure of the ‘true’ product recovery. The total harvested area was 139  ha including 16 forest stands. Seven groups of log products were included in the analysis. The predicted versus real top diameter distributions of sawlogs were evaluated using an error index to express deviations. • Results At the stand level, the average error index values were 0. 15 and 0. 18 for the ALS and BAU approaches, respectively. As a consequence of an overall bias of the ALS tree lists the opposite was found at the total wood flow level, with the field-based data yielding a lower error index. • Conclusions The volume predictions for different log product groups were slightly more accurate in the ALS case than in the BAU case...|$|R
