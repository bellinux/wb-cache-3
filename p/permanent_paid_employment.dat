5000|$|Generally, an {{internship}} {{consists of an}} exchange of services for experience between the student and an organization. Students can also use {{an internship}} {{to determine if they}} have an interest in a particular career, to create a network of contacts, to acquire a recommendation letter to add to their curriculum vitae, or to gain school credit. Some interns find <b>permanent,</b> <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> with the organizations for which they worked upon completion of the internship. This can be a significant benefit to the employer as experienced interns often need little or no training when they begin regular employment. It also helps an employer in gauging a student's aptitude, since grade inflation has undermined the reliability of academic grades. Unlike a trainee program, employment at the completion of an internship is not guaranteed.|$|E
30|$|Noticeable {{differences}} {{exist in the}} probability of entering self-employment for ethnic minorities. The higher propensity to be self-employed for ethnic minorities {{may be attributed to}} unobserved differences between ethnic groups (Parker 2004, pp. 123 – 124). In general, for both genders, the coefficients of being a professional, hours of work and tenure are significantly negative. Spatial variations in self-employment propensities suggest that, for men, these propensities are negative in urban areas and the two city locations with higher-than-average levels of income, Almaty and Astana. These findings may be explained by the housing bubble, which had over-stimulated the economy in urban locations and, in turn, led rural–urban migrants to anticipate more <b>permanent</b> <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> than was actually available.[*]It is also plausible to assume that rent is more expensive in urban locations, as asserted by Parker (2004, pp. 99 – 102). The estimated effect of the exclusion restriction (Experience) is positive and significant, suggesting that individuals with previous self-employment experience have a higher tendency to choose the self-employed sector.|$|E

The theoretical framing is provided by accounts of Chinese cultural values, experiences of Chinese-born skilled migrants and aspects of adult career development. Data were collected using a thematic interview guide focusing on occupational choice, organisational entry and early career experiences. The participants used a variety of techniques described in traditional career development models to find employment and to develop their early career. The students attributed their success in gaining employment to obtaining permanent residency before seeking work, language proficiency, networks developed during their study years, and having a recognised New Zealand qualification...|$|R

40|$|Objective : We explore whether women's <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> is {{associated}} with reductions in women's stated son preference in India and whether these results vary by employment sector (agriculture, manufacturing, services, professional-technical) and skill level (education and literacy). Methods : We conduct a logistic regression analysis {{of the relationship between}} women's <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> and women's stated son preference among a sample of never-pregnant Indian women. We use the 2005 India National Family Health Survey (NFHS). Results : Women's <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> in the service and manufacturing sectors {{is associated}} with significant reductions in the stated son preference of low-skilled women (i. e., low education and literacy). However, this negative association goes away for women at higher skill levels. In fact, <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> in manufacturing {{is associated with}} significantly higher stated son preference among university-educated women. However, women's <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> in agriculture and the professional-technical sectors is not significantly associated with women's stated son preference. Finally, the association between women's <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> and stated son preference is significantly larger for women living in north India than for women living in south and east India. Conclusions : We hypothesize that significant negative associations between women's <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> and women's stated son preference occur only in cases where <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> changes the economic status of women within the family. Contribution : Our analysis demonstrates that there are important linkages between women's <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> and stated son preference, and draws attention to how the context of employment (e. g., sector and skill level) is differentially associated with demographic outcomes...|$|R

30|$|Being {{asked about}} their {{attitude}} towards career advancement self-employed women significantly more often stated high career aspirations than women in <b>paid</b> <b>employment,</b> namely 58 percent vs. 47 percent (which is even higher than the share of 54 percent of male self-employed stating high career aspirations). This may indicate that women with high career aspirations choose self-employment because <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> does not provide them with satisfactory career opportunities (e.g., because {{of the existence of}} a “glass ceiling”), whereas women who attach less importance to career advancement (and more to family-work balance) stay in <b>paid</b> <b>employment.</b> Looking at family background, we find no substantial differences in terms of living with a partner and presence of young children (aged 0 – 5) in the household between self-employed women and women in <b>paid</b> <b>employment.</b>|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This article {{presents}} findings from a scoping review {{that sought to}} highlight {{what is known about}} pre-registration <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> practices of undergraduate nursing students. Background: Researchers have identified large numbers of undergraduate nursing students engaging in <b>paid</b> <b>employment.</b> This review was prompted by our interest in the different employment choices that students make and whether these choices have any impact on transition to practice. Design: A scoping review was designed to map the existing evidence base on undergraduate student nurse employment practices. Scoping reviews support the identification of a broad range of literature, which encompasses all types of study design. Data sources: Utilising key search terms, databases searched included MEDLINE, CINAHL, Psych INFO, EMBASE, SCOPUS, SCIRUS, Joanna Briggs Institute, Web of Science, Informit Health and the Cochrane database. Review method: We utilised Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage approach: identifying the research question; identifying relevant studies; study selection; charting the data; and collating, summarising and reporting the results. Based on the research question, relevant literature was selected which was reported in accordance with Arksey and O'Malley's framework. Results: The scoping review identified 40 articles that explored the nature of undergraduate student nurse <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> activity. Highlighted themes included: reasons for engaging in paid employment; specific <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> models; <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> and academic performance, and <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> choice and transition to graduate practice. Conclusion: The review highlighted a lack of studies detailing the relationship between <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> and transition to graduate nurse practice, particularly those studies situated within the hospitality sector...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{phenomenon}} that {{high numbers of}} full-time students in the UK participate in term time <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> has become {{a feature of the}} current higher educational landscape. A major contributory factor is the revised funding for higher education, placing a higher portion of the funding onto the individual. While student <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> is seen in many Western societies, the structure of a full-time degree in the UK means there is a much higher workload for academic studies. This has given rise to concerns that alongside the beneficial aspects of <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> are negative connotations, which impact on academic achievement and student experience. These concerns are associated with equality and student retention. This research considers the impacts of <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> for full-time students, whether there are characteristics in the employment that facilitate any detrimental impacts, whether there are vulnerable groups in the student population that will be most affected by these. The study used a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, surveys to consider what is happening, interviews and diaries to examine why this is happening. The study acknowledged beneficial aspects to student <b>paid</b> <b>employment,</b> but also identified negative impacts to both academic studies and the student experience. These were associated particularly with term time <b>paid</b> <b>employment,</b> in addition to the amount of hours undertaken. Social class was also identified to contribute, with student time management a major issue. Parental contributions are becoming increasingly important to students to fund their degree. A relatively new concept of social contracts between students and their parents appears to be evolving over recent years, making them become joint agents within the decision-making and choices students are making regarding <b>paid</b> <b>employment.</b> Data analysis is utilised to make recommendations for government, policymakers and universities regarding how negative impacts may be minimised...|$|R
