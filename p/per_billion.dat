5|$|Plants absorb some uranium from soil. Dry weight {{concentrations}} of uranium in plants range from 5 to 60 parts <b>per</b> <b>billion,</b> and ash from burnt wood can have concentrations up to 4 parts per million. Dry weight {{concentrations of}} uranium in food plants are typically lower with {{one to two}} micrograms per day ingested through the food people eat.|$|E
5|$|The main {{evidence}} of such an impact, besides the crater itself, is contained in {{a thin layer of}} clay present in the K–Pg boundary across the world. In the late 1970s, the Alvarezes and colleagues reported that it contained an abnormally high concentration of iridium. Iridium levels in this layer reached 6 parts <b>per</b> <b>billion</b> by weight or more compared to 0.4 for the Earth's crust as a whole; in comparison, meteorites can contain around 470 parts <b>per</b> <b>billion</b> of this element. It was hypothesized that the iridium was spread into the atmosphere when the impactor was vaporized and settled across the Earth's surface amongst other material thrown up by the impact, producing the layer of iridium-enriched clay. Similarly, an iridium anomaly in core samples from the Pacific Ocean suggested the Eltanin impact of about 2.5 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the lighter}} elements, fluorine's {{abundance}} value of 400ppb (parts <b>per</b> <b>billion)</b> – 24th among {{elements in the}} universe – is exceptional: other elements from carbon to magnesium are twenty or more times as common. This is because stellar nucleosynthesis processes bypass fluorine, and any fluorine atoms otherwise created have high nuclear cross sections, allowing further fusion with hydrogen or helium to generate oxygen or neon respectively.|$|E

These are an enormous burden in the United States, Canada, and other industrial countries. We review findings on actual social and economic costs, construct estimates {{of some of the}} costs from pertinent sources, and provide several hypothetical examples consistent with published evidence. Many detailed costs are estimated, but these are fragmented and missing in coverage and jurisdiction. Nonetheless, the cumulative costs identified are very large, totaling $ 568 billion to $ 793 <b>billion</b> <b>per</b> year for Canada and the United States combined. Partial Canadian costs alone are $ 46 billion to $ 52 <b>billion</b> <b>per</b> year. Specifics include diabetes (United States and Canada), $ 128 <b>billion</b> <b>per</b> year; PD in the United States, $ 13 billion to $ 28. 5 <b>billion</b> <b>per</b> year; neurodevelopmental deficits and hypothryoidism are endemic and, including estimates of costs of childhood disorders that evidence suggests are linked, amount to $ 81. 5 billion to $ 167 <b>billion</b> <b>per</b> year for the United States and $ 2 <b>billion</b> <b>per</b> year in Ontario; loss of 5 IQ points cost $ 30 <b>billion</b> <b>per</b> year in Canada and $ 275 billion to $ 326 <b>billion</b> <b>per</b> year in the United States; and hypothetical dynamic economic impacts cost another $ 19 billion to $ 92 <b>billion</b> <b>per</b> year for the United States and Canada combined.

5|$|Concentrations {{of heavy}} metals below the crust are {{generally}} higher, with most being {{found in the}} largely iron-silicon-nickel core. Platinum, for example, comprises approximately 1 part <b>per</b> <b>billion</b> of the crust whereas its concentration in the core {{is thought to be}} nearly 6,000 times higher. Recent speculation suggests that uranium (and thorium) in the core may generate a substantial amount of the heat that drives plate tectonics and (ultimately) sustains the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{is found}} in trace amount in {{numerous}} plants, plankton, and invertebrates, at concentrations of 69 to 5,760 parts <b>per</b> <b>billion</b> (ppb). In vertebrates the concentration is slightly lower, and nearly all vertebrate tissue and body fluids contain lithium ranging from 21 to 763 ppb. Marine organisms tend to bioaccumulate lithium more than terrestrial organisms. Whether lithium has a physiological role {{in any of these}} organisms is unknown.|$|E

The report claims the Posco India project will produce an average of Rs. 249 <b>billion</b> <b>per</b> year ($5.44 <b>billion</b> <b>per</b> year) of steel for India’s economy, contribute an average of Rs. 49.9 <b>billion</b> <b>per</b> year ($1.1 <b>billion</b> <b>per</b> year) of domestic sales taxes, capital goods taxes, value added taxes (VAT), iron ore duties, and employee income taxes, annually for 35 years, for the social programs {{of the central government}} of India and state government of Odisha. The report admits that its analysis is based on nominal numbers using 2007 basis, that it assumes constant steel prices at $450 per tonne through the year 2040, and ignores the effect of inflation in steel prices or in Indian economy. The carbon steel prices between January and July 2011 ranged between $815 to $910 per tonne.|$|R

5|$|Lead's per-particle {{abundance}} in the Solar System is 0.121 ppb (parts <b>per</b> <b>billion).</b> This figure is {{two and a}} half times higher than that of platinum, eight times more than mercury, and seventeen times more than gold. The amount of lead in the universe is slowly increasing as most heavier atoms (all of which are unstable) gradually decay to lead. The abundance of lead in the Solar System since its formation 4.5 billion years ago has increased by about 0.75%. The solar system abundances table shows that lead, despite its relatively high atomic number, is more prevalent than most other elements with atomic numbers greater than 40.|$|E
5|$|Rhenium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Re and atomic number 75. It is a silvery-white, heavy, third-row transition metal in group 7 of the periodic table.

5|$|The {{long-term}} {{solution to this}} problem, however, is to liberate the SI system's dependency on the IPK by developing a practical realization of the kilogram that can be reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification. The units of measure in such a practical realization would have their magnitudes precisely defined and {{expressed in terms of}} fundamental physical constants. While major portions of the SI system would still be based on the kilogram, the kilogram would in turn be based on invariant, universal constants of nature. Much work towards that end is ongoing, though no alternative has yet achieved the uncertainty of 20 parts <b>per</b> <b>billion</b> (~20µg) required to improve upon the IPK.|$|E
5|$|Uranium's average {{concentration}} in the Earth's crust is (depending on the reference) 2 to 4 parts per million, or about 40 times as abundant as silver. The Earth's crust from the surface to 25km (15mi) down is calculated to contain 1017kg (2lb) of uranium while the oceans may contain 1013kg (2lb). The concentration of uranium in soil ranges from 0.7 to 11 parts per million (up to 15 parts per million in farmland soil due to use of phosphate fertilizers), and its {{concentration in}} sea water is 3 parts <b>per</b> <b>billion.</b>|$|E
5|$|In a study {{published}} in 2007, the National Institutes of Health deemed hexavalent chromium VI (chromium-6) to be a likely carcinogen in lab animals when consumed in large quantities in drinking water. Prior to the NIH study, a World Health Organization study found that chromium-6 was a likely cause of lung cancer when inhaled by humans. In 2010, test results released from a California non-profit group known as the Environmental Working Group showed that Norman's tap water has a chromium-6 concentration level of 12.90 parts <b>per</b> <b>billion</b> (ppb), which was the highest level detected among 35 U.S. cities sampled in the study. The group is studying chromium-6 levels in water supplies in an attempt to prove a causal link between the element's ingestion and cancer in humans, and as a result improve the country's water standards.|$|E

5|$|Safety overall has {{steadily}} improved in the United States for many decades. Between 1920 and 2000, {{the rate of}} fatal automobile accidents per vehicle-mile decreased {{by a factor of}} about 17. Except for a pause during the youth bulge of the 1960s (a time when many young, inexperienced drivers were on the road), progress in reducing fatal accidents has been steady. Safety for other types of U.S. passenger transportation has also improved substantially, but long-term statistical data are not as readily available. While the fatality rate roughly leveled off around 2000–2005 at around 1.5 fatalities per 100 million miles traveled, it has resumed a downward trend and reached 1.27 in 2008. The National Safety Council (whose data methodology differs slightly from the NHTSA) reports a rate (including deaths of pedestrians and cyclists killed in motor vehicle accidents) of 1.25 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles (or 12.5 deaths <b>per</b> <b>billion</b> vehicle miles) traveled in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Soluble thulium salts are mildly toxic, but {{insoluble}} thulium salts {{are completely}} nontoxic.

5|$|The {{element is}} never {{found in nature}} in pure form, but it is found in small {{quantities}} in minerals with other rare earths. Thulium is often found with minerals containing yttrium and gadolinium. In particular, thulium occurs in the mineral gadolinite. However, thulium also occurs in the minerals monazite, xenotime, and euxenite. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is 0.5mg/kg by weight and 50 parts <b>per</b> <b>billion</b> by moles. Thulium makes up approximately 0.5 parts per million of soil, although this value can range from 0.4 to 0.8 parts per million. Thulium makes up 250 parts per quadrillion of seawater. In the solar system, thulium exists in concentrations of 200 parts per trillion by weight and 1part per trillion by moles. Thulium ore occurs most commonly in China. However, Australia, Brazil, Greenland, India, Tanzania, and the United States also have large reserves of thulium. Total reserves of thulium are approximately 100,000 tonnes.
