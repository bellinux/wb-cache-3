Many {{men and women}} have loved, and have meant to help each other all their lives; and with the years have drifted asunder; coming even to be against one another. We change and our thoughts change; slight differences of temperament grow into barriers between us; unguessed antagonisms widen into gulfs. Accidents come into our lives. A friend was telling me the other day of a woman who practically proposed to and married a musical genius, purely and solely to be of use to him. She earned quite a big income, drawing fashions; and her idea was to relieve him of the necessity of doing pot-boilers for a living, so that he might devote his whole time to his real work. And a few weeks after they were married she ran the point of a lead pencil through her eye and it set up inflammation of her brain. And now all the poor fellow has to think of is how to make enough to pay for her keep at a private lunatic asylum. I don't mean to be flippant. It's the very absurdity of it all that makes the mystery of life--that renders it so hopeless for us to attempt to find our way through it by our own judgment. It is like the ants making all their clever, laborious <b>plans,</b> <b>knowing</b> nothing of chickens and the gardener's spade. That is why we have to cling to the life we can order for ourselves--the life within us. Truth, Justice, Pity. They are the strong things, the eternal things, the things we've got to sacrifice ourselves for--serve with our bodies and our souls.|$|E

The main empirical findings in this study provide favorable evidence for the performance of managed care. Most of the measures we used to evaluate the quality of health care of managed care plans exhibited comparable level or even better to traditional FFS plans. Specifically, in terms of access to care,: 1) HMO enrollees were more likely having USC provider than FFS enrollees; 2) The providers in HMOs {{were more likely to have}} nights/weekends office hours when compared to FFS enrollees; 3) And, HMO enrollees were much easier to see providers. With regard to satisfaction with the providers, the analysis found no significant differences in any measures across the three types of plans. As for use of health care, HMO enrollees have lower number of nights in hospital for discharges and were more often treated with diet modification compared to FFS enrollees. In regards to health outcome, HMO enrollees were more likely fallen in category of 2 ̆ 2 excellent 2 ̆ 2 health when compared to FFS enrollees. OMC plans exhibited no difference from FFS plans...|$|E

Moreover, services for people with an intellectual disability have moved from the traditional institutional setting to supporting people with an intellectual disability to live in their own community and family home.

This study aims to describe the provision of community nursing support for persons with an intellectual disability and palliative/end-of-life care needs from the perspective of community nurses. A quantitative descriptive cross-sectional survey was employed. On receipt of ethical approval, data were collected through self-reporting questionnaires and descriptive analysis was conducted to describe frequencies and to identify patterns of the respondents using spss version 18.

Problems discussed and solutions provided will hopefully serve well to highlight points of improvement for small service firms, especially where the owners are inexperienced in business, marketing and entrepreneurship. The study is conducted {{with the aim of}} providing realistic solutions for The Norwegian Imago Institute. In the process, eight people with great insight and experience were interviewed in Norway, Sweden and Denmark and a survey sent to 250 people with 11 respondents. The paper concludes that previous experience with employment is often necessary to succeed with employment growth. However, other forms of growth proved to have great potential.

What increases the odds of success is writing a business and liquidity <b>plan,</b> <b>knowing</b> exactly what and where you want to go, innovative thinking about marketing, PR and standardization of services. The implication for small service firms that lack experience in business, marketing and entrepreneurship is mostly a realization that they have to change their view on profitability from thinking it’s a evil phenomenon of the information age to the fact that having healthy profitability might actually improve the service and experience.

The {{objective of}} this pilot study {{was to develop a}} comprehensive program to sharpen performance of experienced cardiac surgical teams in acute crisis management. MethodsWe developed and implemented an educational program for cardiac surgery based on high realism acute crisis simulation scenarios and interactive whole-unit workshop. The impact of these interventions was assessed with postintervention questionnaires, preintervention and 6 -month postintervention surveys, and structured interviews. ResultsThe realism of the acute crisis simulation scenarios gradually improved; most participants rated both the simulation and whole-unit workshop as very good or excellent. Repeat simulation training was recommended every 6 to 12 months by 82 % of the participants. Participants of the interactive workshop identified 2 areas of highest priority: encouraging speaking up about critical information and interprofessional information sharing. They also stressed the importance of briefings, early communication of surgical <b>plan,</b> <b>knowing</b> members of the team, and continued simulation for practice. The pre/post survey response rates were 70 % (55 / 79) and 66 % (52 / 79), respectively. The concept of working as a team improved between surveys (P = . 028), with a trend for improvement in gaining common understanding of the plan before a procedure (P = . 075) and appropriate resolution of disagreements (P = . 092). Interviewees reported that the training had a positive effect on their personal behaviors and patient care, including speaking up more readily and communicating more clearly.
