40|$|U. S. warfighters {{are being}} asked to work in ever more complex {{operations}} and environments, where everyone from the general officer to the “strategic corporal ” must engage in critical reasoning and creative thinking. Advanced military professional schools often address such skills, adopting a virtual apprenticeship or mentorship approach: students analyze past cases and work through problems while an expert practitioner probes their thinking and models good practice. As more of our military requires such skills, it is desirable to make this labor-intensive form of education readily available to a broader military audience. The emerging technology of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) has successfully provided computer-based training with automated individualized assessment and instruction across a range of <b>procedural</b> and <b>reasoning</b> tasks. Scenario-based techniques can potentially allow ITS construction even when computerized expert performance models cannot be built.

40|$|We {{present an}} epistemic default logic, {{based on the}} metaphore of a meta-level architecture. Upward {{reflection}} is formalized by a nonmonotonic entailment relation, based on the objective facts that are either known or unknown at the object level. Then, the meta (monotonic) reasoning process generates a number of “default-beliefs” of object-level formulas. We extend this framework by proposing a mechanism to reflect these defaults down. Such a reflection is seen as essentially having a temporal flavour: defaults derived at the meta-level are projected as facts in a “next” object level state. In this way, we obtain temporal models for default reasoning in meta-level formalisms which can be conceived as labeled branching trees. Thus, descending the tree corresponds to shifts in time that model downward reflection, whereas the branching of the tree corresponds to ways of combining possible defaults. All together, this yields an operational or <b>procedural</b> semantics of <b>reasoning</b> by default, which admits one to reason about it by means of branching-time temporal logic. Finally, we define sceptical and credulous entailment relations based on these temporal models and we characterize Reiter extensions in our semantics...|$|R
40|$|Currently, the {{numerical}} simulation of flow and/or water quality {{becomes more and}} more sophisticated. There arises a demand on the integration of recent knowledge management (KM), artificial intelligence technology with the conventional hydraulic algorithmic models in order to assist novice application users in selection and manipulation of various mathematical tools. In this paper, an ontology-based KM system (KMS) is presented, which employs a three-stage life cycle for the ontology design and a Java/XML-based scheme for automatically generating knowledge search components. The prototype KMS on flow and water quality is addressed to simulate human expertise during the problem solving by incorporating artificial intelligence and coupling various descriptive knowledge, <b>procedural</b> knowledge and <b>reasoning</b> knowledge involved in the coastal hydraulic and transport processes. The ontology is divided into information ontology and domain ontology in order to realize the objective of semantic match for knowledge search.

40|$|Situation {{assessment}} (SA) involves deriving {{relations among}} entities, e. g., the aggregation of object states (i. e., classification and location). While SA {{has been recognized}} in the information fusion and human factors literature, there still exist open questions regarding knowledge representation and reasoning methods to afford SA. For instance, while lots of data is collected over a region of interest, how does this information get presented to an attention constrained user? The information overload can deteriorate cognitive reasoning so a pragmatic solution to knowledge representation is needed for effective and efficient situation understanding.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{compilation}} of four papers in which mathematical reasoning is examined in various contexts, in which mathematics is an integral part. It is known from previous studies that a focus on rote learning and <b>procedural</b> mathematical <b>reasoning</b> hamper students’ learning of mathematics. The aims of this thesis are to explore how mathematical reasoning affects upper secondary students’ possibilities to master the physics curricula, and how real-life contexts in mathematics affect students’ mathematical reasoning. This is done by analysing the mathematical reasoning requirements in Swedish national physics tests; {{as well as by}} examining how mathematical reasoning affects students’ success on the tests/tasks. Furthermore, the possible effect of the presence of real-life contexts in Swedish national mathematics tasks on students’ success is explored; as well as if the effect differs when account is taken to mathematical reasoning requirements. The framework that is used for categorising mathematical reasoning, distinguishes between imitative and creative mathematical reasoning, where the latter, in particular, involves reasoning based on intrinsic properties. Data consisted of ten Swedish national physics tests for upper secondary school, with additional student data for eight of the tests; and six Swedish national mathematics tests for upper secondary school, with additional student data. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used in the analyses. The qualitative analysis consisted of structured comparisons between representative student solutions and the students’ educational history. Furthermore, various descriptive statistics and significance tests were used. The main results are {{that a majority of the}} physics tasks require mathematical reasoning, and particularly that creative mathematical reasoning is required to fully master the physics curricula. Moreover, the ability to reason mathematically creatively seems to have a positive effect on students’ success on physics tasks. The results indicate additionally, that there is an advantage of the presence of real-life context in mathematics tasks when creative mathematical reasoning is required. This advantage seems to be particularly notable for students with lower grades...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntroductionMotor {{coordination}} disorders {{caused by}} cerebellar dysfunction are well known. However, the less known cerebellar neuropsychological disorders also merit attention, since they occur {{more frequently than}} one might imagine. Case reportWe describe a 66 -year-old patient with severe cerebellar damage caused by hemorrhagic stroke and associated with cognitive impairments (including impaired executive function, reasoning and judgment). A {{review of the literature}} on these neuropsychological disorders revealed a set of clinical, anatomical and functional imaging arguments that prompted us to broaden our vision of the cerebellum's role by acknowledging the presence of a cognitive component as well as the well-known motility component. In fact, there is good evidence of altered executive function (including mental flexibility, scheduling capacities and verbal working memory) in cerebellar patients. Visuospatial capacities are also affected, with disorders of visual memory and construction abilities having been reported. In terms of language, we noted reports of hypospontaneity and agrammatism with syntax problems. Memory (especially verbal memory), learning (both associative and <b>procedural),</b> judgment and <b>reasoning</b> also seem to be affected. In terms of emotion, various types of abnormal behavior and psychiatric disorders have been described and range from depression to true psychoses.

40|$|Objective: Simulation is now firmly {{established}} in modern surgical training and is applicable {{not only to}} acquiring surgical skills but also to non-surgical skills and professionalism. A 5 -day intensive Urology Simulation Boot Camp was run to teach emergency <b>procedural</b> skills, clinical <b>reasoning,</b> and communication skills using clinical scenario simulations, endoscopic and laparoscopic trainers. This paper reports the educational value of this first urology boot camp. Subjects and methods: Sixteen urology UK trainees completed pre-course questionnaires on their operative experience and confidence level in common urological procedures. The course included seven modules covering basic scrotal procedures, laparoscopic skills, ureteroscopy, transurethral resection of the prostate and bladder tumour, green light laser prostatectomy, familiarisation with common endoscopic equipment, bladder washout to remove clots, bladder botox injection, setting up urodynamics. Emergency urological conditions were managed using scenarios on SimMan®. The main focus of the course was hands-on training using animal models, bench-top models and virtual reality simulators. Post-course assessment and feedback on the course structure and utility of knowledge gained together with a global outcome score was collected. Results: Overall all the sections of feedback received score of over 4. 5 / 5, with the hands-on training on simulators getting the best score 4. 8 / 5. When trainees were asked “The training has equipped me with enhanced knowledge, understanding and skills,” the average score was 4. 9 / 5. 0. The vast majority of participants felt they would recommend the boot camp to future junior trainees. Conclusion: This first UK Urology Simulation Boot Camp has demonstrated feasibility and effectiveness in enhancing trainee’s experience. Given these positive feedbacks {{there is a good}} reason to expect that future courses will improve the overall skills of a new urology trainee...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{outcome of}} formal {{education is the}} acquisition of knowledge that will facilitate domain specific problem-solving skill. Theories of human intelligence identify general reasoning as a cognitive ability that is strongly associated with solving novel problems where learning about the problem is necessary. This dissertation investigates individual differences, such as general reasoning, that may influence how an individual structures knowledge within a domain, such as bicycle gears, and subsequent problem-solving skill. Special focus is given to identifying the structural characteristics of the acquired bicycle gear knowledge and relating these characteristics to general reasoning and skill at solving bicycle gear problems. College participants (N = 174, 111 female) completed a general reasoning test, reported the bicycle parts they knew, and their mechanical self-efficacy was assessed before they watched a training video on bicycle gear adjustment. After training, {{the extent of their}} procedural knowledge was tested, the structure of their knowledge was elicited, and then their skill at fixing bicycle gear problems was tested. Professional bicycle mechanics (N = 3) were recruited to provide a criterion for evaluating the structural characteristics of bicycle gear knowledge. The results from regression analysis indicated that bicycle gear problem-solving skill had a stronger relation with how knowledge was structured, as compared to the extent of <b>procedural</b> knowledge, general <b>reasoning,</b> mechanical self-efficacy, or problem-solving effort. Regression analysis of knowledge structure indicated that general reasoning was associated with acquiring an expert-like knowledge structure, as was learning effort and pre-training bicycle part knowledge, but not mechanical self-efficacy. These results support the view that general reasoning is associated with problem solving because it facilitates the acquisition of knowledge that is structured similarly to experienced professionals. If it is the structure of knowledge that facilitates or hinders problem-solving, as suggested by this study’s results, mechanical training may be enhanced by an explicit focus on structuring knowledge to replicate that of experts. A focus on using educational materials that impart the desired knowledge structure may significantly reduce the need of general reasoning in achieving mechanical expertise...|$|R
