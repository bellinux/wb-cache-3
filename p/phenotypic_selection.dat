Here I present two empirical {{studies on the}} effectiveness of genomewide selection within biparental populations in maize (Zea mays L.). To my knowledge, these are the first reported empirical studies {{on the effectiveness of}} genomewide selection compared to <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection,</b> across multiple years and locations within individual biparental populations. In the first study, I report the results of a comparison of <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection</b> and genomewide selection based on multiple years (2008 - 2012), multiple locations (six per year), and two testers. My objectives were to compare the accuracy of <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection,</b> genomewide selection and an index for combined phenotypic and marker information. <b>Phenotypic</b> <b>selection</b> was always as accurate as or more accurate than genomewide selection. Selection based on marker and phenotypic information was slightly more accurate than genomewide selection or <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection</b> alone. I concluded that for genomewide selection to be superior to <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection,</b> the gains must not be measured in terms of the per-generation response with equal population sizes and selection intensities. In the second study I considered different total budgets and per-sample costs for phenotyping and genotyping in maize and assessed the observed and expected gains from the schemes for <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection</b> and genomewide selection. My objectives were {{to determine whether or not}} genomewide selection is more efficient than <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection</b> under a fixed budget and to give recommendations for implementing genomewide selection in a commercial maize breeding program. Whether or not genomewide selection was more efficient than <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection</b> depended on the following factors: (1) accuracy of <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection</b> and of genomewide selection for the trait in a given cross; (2) size of the training population; (3) total budget; (4) costs of producing and genotyping a DH line; and (5) number of selected lines. The results indicated that in general prediction accuracies above 0. 50 usually lead to higher efficiency in genomewide selection. In general, the relative efficiencies decreased as size of the training population decreased. A larger total budget and lower costs of DH production and of genotyping would enable larger test populations, thus leading to higher efficiencies of genomewide selection...|$|E

Through a combination of overexpression and knockouts of relevant genes and optimization of transformation and oligonucleotide designs, we achieve high gene-modification frequencies at levels that only require screening of dozens of cells. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach in three divergent yeast strains, including those involved in industrial production of biobased chemicals. Furthermore, YOGE can be iteratively executed via cycling to generate genomic libraries up to 105 individuals at each round for diversity generation.

The objective of this investigation was to compare the use of <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection</b> to a combination of AFLP marker assisted selection and <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection</b> in a maize backcross project.

Analysis of data, both combined across generations and within the BC 3 S 2 generation, resulted in similar conclusions. First, positive <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection</b> was found to be effective used per se in recovery of the recurrent parent.

Markers significantly associated with the trait were used to calculate marker scores in MARS, whereas all markers were used (without significance tests) to calculate marker scores in genomewide selection. Responses to <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection</b> and to genomewide selection were consistently greater than the response to MARS. With population sizes of N = 50 or 70, responses to genomewide selection were 4 to 25 % larger than the corresponding responses to <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection,</b> depending on the heritability and number of quantitative trait loci.

An alternative to solve this problem is to use the opaque- 2 gene, which improves the level of these amino acids, but has negative pleiotropic effects on agronomic characters. A <b>phenotypic</b> recurrent <b>selection</b> scheme was carried out in two non-opaque maize populations to verify the possibility of improving their protein quality without using this gene. Four cycles were completed and a 20 % selection intensity for tryptophan content in the kernels was used in two populations, IG- 1 and IG- 2. The original and the four-cycle populations were evaluated in three locations for agronomic traits. For protein and tryptophan content, a separated trial was carried out because plants of the plots were hand-pollinated. No increase in tryptophan content was observed in the IG- 2 population, whereas IG- 1 presented a small increase (0. 70 % per cycle). The ratio tryptophan/protein increased 1. 26 % per cycle in IG- 1 and the protein content did not increase in both populations. The ESALQ-VD 2 -opaque check was superior in relation to both populations for protein quality, as expected, even after completion of four selection cycles.

The breeding lines were divided into six sets designated as one parent set and five consecutive progeny sets comprised of representative samples of breeding lines over a five-year period. We used these data sets to investigate the effect of model and training population composition on prediction accuracy over time. We found little difference in prediction accuracy among the models confirming prior studies that found the simplest model, RR-BLUP, to be accurate {{across a range of}} situations. In general, we found that using the parent set was sufficient to predict progeny sets with little to no gain in accuracy from generating larger training populations by combining the parent set with subsequent progeny sets. The prediction accuracy ranged from 0. 03 to 0. 99 across the four traits and five progeny sets. We explored characteristics of the training and validation populations (marker allele frequency, population structure, and linkage disequilibrium) as well as characteristics of the trait (genetic architecture and heritability). Fixation of markers associated with a trait over time was most clearly associated with reduced prediction accuracy for the mycotoxin trait DON. Higher trait heritability in the training population and simpler trait architecture were associated with greater prediction accuracy. Genomic selection is a marker based selection method that promises to improve and accelerate the breeding process in plants and animals. Numerous studies have investigated the gain per unit time; however very limited studies have directly compared gains from genomic and <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection</b> using empirical data. In this study, we used five consecutive sets of breeding lines to compare the gain between genomic and <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection.</b> In each set, about ninety six barley breeding lines were phenotypically evaluated for yield, FHB resistance, and DON accumulation. A set 168 historic parental lines were used as a training population to predict the performance of the selection candidate sets using RR-BLUP. All lines were genotyped using 1, 536 SNP markers (BOPA 1) for all seven barley chromosomes. The best performing 10 % of the breeding lines in each year were selected using the two schemes and revaluated together in several trials in Minnesota and North Dakota. We made direct comparison between genomic and <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection</b> in two selection candidate sets for yield and five sets for FHB resistance and DON accumulation. We assessed the relative efficiency of genomic over <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection</b> and changes in the genetic similarity using the two selection schemes. Results showed similar response to selection between genomic and <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection</b> in most cases. Genomic selection resulted in more genetic similarity only for FHB resistance; however, for yield and DON concentration no changes in the genetic similarity were detected between genomic and <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection.</b> In addition, we assessed the use of <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection</b> for FHB, genomic selection for FHB, and genomic selection for DON as indirect selection methods to select for low DON concentration. We did not find significant differences between direct and indirect selection methods...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A {{mathematical}} {{approach to}} optimize selection on multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) and {{an estimate of}} residual polygenic effects was applied to selection on two linked or unlinked additive QTL. Strategies to maximize total or cumulative discounted response over ten generations were compared to standard QTL selection on the sum of breeding values for the QTL and an estimated breeding value for polygenes, and to <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection.</b> Optimal selection resulted in greater response to selection than standard QTL or <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection.</b> Tight linkage between the QTL (recombination rate 0. 05) resulted in a slightly lower response for standard QTL and <b>phenotypic</b> <b>selection</b> but in a greater response for optimal selection. Optimal selection capitalized on linkage by emphasizing selection on favorable haplotypes. When the objective was to maximize total response after ten generations and QTL were unlinked, optimal selection increased QTL frequencies to fixation in a near linear manner. When starting frequencies were equal for the two QTL, equal emphasis was given to each QTL, regardless {{of the difference in}} effects of the QTL and regardless of the linkage, but the emphasis given to each of the two QTL was not additive. These results demonstrate the ability of optimal selection to capitalize on information on the complex genetic basis of quantitative traits that is forthcoming. </p...|$|E

This fact is crucial for the establishment of genetic breeding programs. The present research aimed to produce a synthetic variety of maize from the interbreeding of cultivars available in the market, as well as to evaluate the agronomic performance observed during the <b>phenotypic</b> recurrent <b>selection</b> procedure. It was observed that the selected population showed a great homogeneity, creating a uniform population, which is required for the cultivar registration. The evaluation of the agronomic performance of genotypes contributed to the generation of basic knowledge required to process development of this new variety. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} {{stabilizing}} selection on a multilocus character is proposed {{that allows the}} maintenance of stable allelic polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium. The model is a generalization of Lerner's model of homeostasis in which heterozygotes are less susceptible to environmental variation and hence are superior to homozygotes under <b>phenotypic</b> stabilizing <b>selection.</b> The analysis is carried out for weak selection with a quadratic-deviation model for the stabilizing selection. The stationary state is characterized by unequal allele frequencies, unequal proportions of complementary gametes, and a reduction of the genetic (and phenotypic) variance by the linkage disequilibrium. The model is compared with Mather's polygenic balance theory, with models that include mutation-selection balance, and others that have been proposed to study the role of linkage disequilibrium in quantitative inheritance...|$|R

The application of these classic breeding methods yielded continuous progress of great value to increase the profitability of the shrimp industry in several countries.

In particular, these novel techniques may help increase disease resistance to specific emerging diseases, which is today a very important component of shrimp breeding programs.
