2500|$|A {{side effect}} of the Social Security program in the United States has been the near-universal {{adoption}} of the program's identification number, the Social Security number, as the de facto U.S. national identification number. The social security number, or SSN, is issued pursuant to section 205(c)(2) of the Social Security Act, codified as [...] The government originally stated that the SSN {{would not be a}} means of identification, but currently a multitude of U.S. entities use the Social Security number as a <b>personal</b> <b>identifier.</b> These include government agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service, the military as well as private agencies such as banks, colleges and universities, health insurance companies, and employers.|$|E

50|$|Common {{strategies}} of de-identification are masking <b>personal</b> <b>identifiers</b> and generalizing quasi-identifiers. Pseudonymization {{is the main}} technique used to mask <b>personal</b> <b>identifiers</b> from data records and k-anonymization is usually adopted for generalizing quasi-identifiers.|$|R

50|$|Being able to dial {{telephone}} numbers the way customers {{have come to}} expect is considered crucial for the convergence of classic telephone service (PSTN) and Internet telephony (Voice over IP, VoIP), and for the development of new IP multimedia services. The problem of a single universal <b>personal</b> <b>identifier</b> for multiple communication services can be solved with different approaches. One simple approach is the Electronic Number Mapping System (ENUM), developed by the IETF, using existing E.164 telephone numbers, protocols and infrastructure to indirectly access different services available under a single <b>personal</b> <b>identifier.</b> ENUM also permits connecting the IP world to the telephone system in a seamless manner.|$|E

50|$|The new enlisted service numbers {{applied only}} to those drafted and ranged from 60 000 000 to 69 999 999 with the first two numbers a {{recruiting}} code and the last six a <b>personal</b> <b>identifier.</b> At the same time, there were still {{a wide variety of}} older enlisted numbers still active, ranging back to the thirty million series used during World War II.|$|E
5000|$|Within the Regular Air Force, {{the range}} of 11 000 000 to 19 999 999 was {{reserved}} for Regular Air Force personnel who had enlisted from within the United States; With the first two numbers a geographical code and the last six a <b>personal</b> <b>identifier.</b> This gave geographical recruiting areas 999,999 service numbers a piece to allocate to new recruits. Air Force regulations directed against repeating service numbers and allocated only a certain block of numbers for certain time periods of enlistments. Instructions were also in place that Air Force service members should not be assigned numbers already held by Regular Army soldiers. This resulted in the first 200,000 <b>personal</b> <b>identifier</b> numbers of each geographical code remaining un-issued, since these numbers had already been exhausted by assignments to Regular Army personnel.The breakdown of Regular Air Force service number assignments, from 1947 to the discontinuation of service numbers in 1969, was as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|In an {{experiment}} in Northern Ireland using <b>personal</b> <b>identifiers,</b> such as National Insurance numbers and signatures, the number of registered electors fell by some ten thousand. It was also understood that the new process may have resulted in fictitious voters being dropped from rolls.|$|R
50|$|The {{acquisition}} of <b>personal</b> <b>identifiers</b> {{is made possible}} through serious breaches of privacy. For consumers, this is usually a result of them naively providing their personal information or login credentials to the identity thieves {{as a result of}} being duped but identity-related documents such as credit cards, bank statements, utility bills, checkbooks etc. may also be physically stolen from vehicles, homes, offices, and not the least letter boxes, or directly from victims by pickpockets and bag snatchers. Guardianship of <b>personal</b> <b>identifiers</b> by consumers is the most common intervention strategy recommended by the US Federal Trade Commission, Canadian Phone Busters and most sites that address identity theft. Such organizations offer recommendations on how individuals can prevent their information falling into the wrong hands.|$|R
50|$|Identity scores {{incorporate}} a broad set of consumer data that gauges a person’s legitimacy. Identity score components can include (but {{are not limited}} to) <b>personal</b> <b>identifiers,</b> public records, Internet data, government records, corporate data, predicted behavior patterns based on empiric data, self-assessed behavior patterns, and credit records.|$|R
50|$|After {{the close}} of World War II, all states began issuing guard {{personnel}} service numbers {{whether or not the}} guardsman had been federalized. National Guard service numbers were extended from their previous cap of 20 999 999 to a new range from 20 000 000 to 29 999 999. The first two numbers were a state identification code while the last six a <b>personal</b> <b>identifier.</b>|$|E
50|$|Given {{the growing}} problem of {{identity}} theft {{and the importance}} of the Social Security number as a <b>personal</b> <b>identifier</b> in the United States, it might seem unusual that these identifiers are released publicly. However, because the documents held by the Social Security Administration are government records, it is required to make the information public under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In fact, the related Death Master File is used to prevent fraud so that no one can steal the identity of a dead person, and take out a credit card or a bank loan in a dead person's name.|$|E
50|$|The {{service number}} range of 11 000 000 to 19 000 000 {{was used by}} Regular Air Force {{in the same manner}} as the Army, in that these numbers were {{reserved}} for Regular Air Force personnel, who had enlisted from inside the United States, with the first two numbers a geographical code and the last six a <b>personal</b> <b>identifier.</b> The geographical codes for the Air Force were the same as the Army and recruiting stations had instructions to avoid repeat service numbers and to ensure that no service number was issued by both the Army and the Air Force.|$|E

50|$|Identity theft can be {{partially}} mitigated by not identifying oneself unnecessarily (a form of information security control known as risk avoidance). This implies that organizations, IT systems and procedures should not demand excessive amounts of personal information or credentials for identification and authentication. Requiring, storing and processing <b>personal</b> <b>identifiers</b> (such as Social Security number, national identification number, driver's license number, credit card number, etc.) increases {{the risks of}} identity theft unless this valuable personal information is adequately secured at all times. Committing <b>personal</b> <b>identifiers</b> to memory is a sound practice that can reduce the risks of a would-be identity thief from obtaining these records. To help in remembering numbers such as social security numbers and credit card numbers, {{it is helpful to}} consider using mnemonic techniques or memory aids such as the mnemonic Major System.|$|R
50|$|User IDs, {{also known}} as logins, user names, logons or accounts, are unique <b>personal</b> <b>identifiers</b> for agents of a {{computer}} program or network that is accessible {{by more than one}} agent.

5000|$|By 1942, the Army {{had also}} {{discontinued}} the prefix O and established that all officer numbers would {{begin with a}} zero. For instance, an officer with the service number 2,345,678 would have the number written in military records as 02 345 678.The remaining enlisted draft force of the Army of the United States were issued service numbers in the 30 million range. Service number ranged from 30 000 000 to 39 999 999. As with Regular Army service numbers, the first two numbers corresponded to a geographical area where a person had been drafted and the last six were a <b>personal</b> <b>identifier.</b> The geographical codes were as follows: ...|$|E
5000|$|By the {{outbreak}} of the Vietnam War, the Navy realized that the enlisted service number system would require an overhaul as new numbers were running out and repeat issuances were becoming more and more common. As a result, the Navy created the [...] "B" [...] series with new enlisted numbers ranging from 10,001 to 99,999. The numbers would be annotated in the format [...] "B12 34 56" [...] with all six numbers a <b>personal</b> <b>identifier.</b> The intent of the Navy was to continue with higher letters of the alphabet upon the exhaustion of all available numbers. This would effectively grant the Navy over two million new service numbers.|$|E

50|$|As a solution, the Navy {{changed the}} way it issued enlisted service numbers and now {{provided}} service numbers from all nine series. Instead of the first number indicating a decade, this number now specified a recruiting district code. By the start of World War II, the Navy was regularly issuing enlisted service numbers from the two through nine hundred series (200 00 01 - 999 99 99) with the first number indicating a recruiting code and the last six a <b>personal</b> <b>identifier.</b> This service number system remained unchanged after World War II and continued through the Korean War and into Vietnam.
