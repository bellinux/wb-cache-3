The first releases of the successive books in the series followed in the same style but somewhat more realistic, illustrating scenes from the books. These covers were created by first Cliff Wright and then Jason Cockroft.|$|E
5|$|Vandersteen {{could no}} longer handle the work load on his own. In 1949, he hired his first collaborator, François-Joseph Herman. Herman stayed with Vandersteen only three years, but his tenure {{was the start of}} the large Studio Vandersteen, which has {{continued}} the series. He was followed by Karel Boumans in 1952, who was an anonymous contributor until 1959. He worked mainly for De grappen van Lambik, a Suske en Wiske spin-off Vandersteen created for the weekly newspaper De Bond, which ran from 24 January 1954 on. But he also inked many Suske en Wiske comics, including those in Tintin. Vandersteen devoted himself more and more towards the storytelling and the initial <b>pencil</b> <b>drawing,</b> which he considered the artistic process, while the inking was more of a craft.|$|E

25|$|The project {{preparation}} {{started in the}} year of 1996. The actual work of drawing pencil sketch started in May 1997. It got completed on the eve of independence day of 1997. (15 Aug 1997). It took 72 consecutive days, which was 1728 hours of work. Pramod dedicated 3 months for this project. He had to work at night to reduce disturbance of street watchers. The artist believes that this pencil sketch was the turning point in his life. Expenses made for this painting were 500,000 Rs. It included preparations of the wall, painting of the wall and other procedures to make the wall ready for <b>pencil</b> <b>drawing.</b> Initially, the pencil required for the sketch were sponsored by Camlin (A pencil company) till the completion of the project.|$|E
25|$|Animation for A Charlie Brown Christmas {{was created}} by Bill Melendez Productions. Mendelson had no idea whether or not {{completing}} a half-hour's worth of animation would be possible given the production's six-month schedule, but Melendez confirmed its feasibility. In actuality, animation was only completed {{in the final four}} months of production. CBS initially wanted an hour's worth of animation, but Melendez talked them down to a half-hour special, believing an hour of television animation was too much. Having never worked on a half-hour special before, Melendez phoned Bill Hanna of Hanna-Barbera for advice, who declined to give any. CBS gave a budget of $76,000 to produce the show, and it went over budget, costing $96,000. The first step in creating the animation was to make a <b>pencil</b> <b>drawing,</b> afterwards inking and painting the drawing onto a cel. The cel was then placed onto a painted background. There are 13,000 drawings in the special, with 12 frames per second to create the illusion of movement.|$|E

500|$|William Gilpin, in his Observations on the River Wye, and Several Parts of South Wales, etc. Relative Chiefly to Picturesque Beauty; {{made in the}} Summer of the Year 1770, {{published}} in 1782, generated considerable interest in the natural and man-made attractions of South Wales and heralded {{the development of the}} Wye Tour {{as an alternative to the}} Grand Tour. As a consequence, Monnow Bridge and Gatehouse became a popular subject for artists. A late 18th-century watercolour by Michael Angelo Rooker is now in the Monmouth Museum. The noted architectural watercolourist Samuel Prout painted the bridge in a study dated [...] "before 1814", now held at the Yale Center for British Art in Connecticut. In 1795, J. M. W. Turner sketched the bridge and gatehouse during one of his annual summer sketching tours. Henry Gastineau drew the bridge [...] Due to a printing error that confused his drawing of the bridge with one of the tower at Raglan Castle on the opposite page of the printed collection, Gastineau's image often appears with the title Gate and Bridge, Ragland. The watercolourist and etcher John Sell Cotman sketched the bridge in the early 19th century, his drawing showing the overhanging accommodation and guardhouse that were later removed. Joshua Cristall produced a similar pencil sketch in 1803. The artist of the American West Thomas Moran produced an undated <b>pencil</b> <b>drawing</b> of the bridge which is printed in his Field Sketches. A depiction of the bridge in stained glass by Charles Eamer Kempe can be seen in the Memorial of the Boer War window in St Mary's Priory Church in Monmouth.|$|E

60|$|Professional skill {{might be}} {{exercised}} very effectively in retouching composites. It {{would be easy}} to obliterate the ghosts of stray features that are always present when the composite is made from only a few portraits, and it would not be difficult to tone down any irregularity in the features themselves, due to some obtrusive peculiarity in one of the components. A higher order of artistic skill might be well bestowed upon the composites that have been made out {{of a large number of}} components. Here the irregularities disappear, the features are perfectly regular and idealised, but the result is dim. It is like a <b>pencil</b> <b>drawing,</b> where many attempts have been made to obtain the desired effect; such a drawing is smudged and ineffective; but the artist, under its guidance, draws his final work with clear bold touches, and then he rubs out the smudge. On precisely the same principle the faint but beautifully idealised features of these composites are, I believe, capable of forming the basis of a very high order of artistic work.|$|E

Or you can talk with the post directly. Ask him where he came from, who {{put him in the}} ground, and what he was put in the ground for, and what kind of a tree he was when he was a part of a tree growing in the woods; and, following the subject out, the conversation may be the means of not only amusing the child for the moment, but also of gratifying his curiosity, and imparting a great amount of useful information to him which will materially aid in the development of his powers.|$|E
60|$|There was one {{advantage}} which John {{and his wife}} found, {{in the way in}} which they furnished their house, that I have hinted at before: it gave freedom to their children. Though their rooms were beautiful, it was not with the tantalizing beauty of expensive and frail knick-knacks. Pictures hung against the wall, and statuary safely lodged on brackets, speak constantly to the childish eye, but are out of the reach of childish fingers, and are not upset by childish romps. They are not, like china and crystal, liable to be used and abused by servants; they do not wear out; they are not spoiled by dust, nor consumed by moths. The beauty once there is always there; though the mother be ill and in her chamber, she has no fears that she shall find it all wrecked and shattered. And this style of beauty, inexpensive as it is, compared with luxurious furniture, is a means of cultivation. No child is ever stimulated to draw or to read by an Axminster carpet or a carved centre-table; but a room surrounded with photographs and pictures and fine casts suggests a thousand inquiries, stimulates the little eye and hand. The child is found with its <b>pencil,</b> <b>drawing,</b> or he asks for a book on Venice, or wants to hear the history of the Roman Forum.|$|E
