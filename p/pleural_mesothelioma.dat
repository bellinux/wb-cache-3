Long-term inhalation of a ceramic fiber (RCF- 1) results in {{a high incidence of}} <b>pleural</b> <b>mesotheliomas</b> in Syrian golden hamsters but not in identically exposed Fischer- 344 rats. The present study compared the histopathology of the early pleural response in rats and hamsters instilled with artificial fibers. Groups of Syrian golden hamsters and Fischer- 344 rats were instilled with ceramic (RCF- 1) or glass (MMVF- 10) fibers directly into the pleural space. Each species received approximately equal numbers of long, thin fibers per g body weight. Fiber-induced lesions were compared 7 and 28 days postinstillation. Both hamsters and rats developed qualitatively similar dose-dependent inflammatory lesions that were not fiber-type specific. Both species developed fibrosis in conjunction with inflammation in the visceral pleura, but a striking interspecies difference was noted in the pattern of mesothelial cell response. Hamsters developed greater surface meso-thelial cell proliferation and had focal aggregates of mesothelial cells embedded deep within regions of visceral pleural fibrosis. It is hypothesized from the present study that the marked fiber-induced proliferative me-sothelial cell response of the hamster visceral pleura may explain the high number of <b>pleural</b> <b>mesotheliomas</b> found in long-term fiber studies in this species...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{investigate}} whether workers in Swedish sulfate mills {{have an increased}} risk of death from certain malignancies that have previously been linked to the pulping process.  METHODS—Subjects of the study (n= 2480) were men aged 40 - 75 at death during 1960 - 89 in the parishes surrounding four sulfate mills. Exposure assessment was based on information from the personnel files in the mills— 35 % of the subjects were recognised there, and work categories were created.  RESULTS—Among all sulfate mill workers, the odds ratio (OR) (90 % confidence interval (90 % CI)) for death from lung cancer was 1. 6  (1. 1  to 2. 3), <b>pleural</b> <b>mesotheliomas</b> 9. 5  (1. 9  to 48), brain tumours 2. 6  (1. 2  to 5. 3), and liver or biliary tract cancer 2. 3  (1. 0  to 5. 2). There was an increased mortality from leukaemia among workers in the soda recovery plant (5. 9  (2. 6  to 13)) and bleaching plant and digester house (2. 8  (1. 0  to 7. 5)).  CONCLUSIONS—Sulfate mill workers were at increased risk of dying from lung cancer and <b>pleural</b> <b>mesotheliomas,</b> probably due to exposure to asbestos.

40|$|The {{ability to}} immortalize human {{mesothelioma}} cells in vitro with simian virus (SV) 40 {{and the fact}} that SV 40 induces mesotheliomas in hamsters prompted us to look for SV 40 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences in human mesotheliomas. In a previous study, we found that over half (29 / 48) of human malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>mesotheliomas</b> contained SV 40 -like sequences whereas only a few (3 / 47) control samples contained the same detectable sequences. The SV 40 genome encodes the 90 KD nuclear large T-antigen (Tag) and the 17 KD small-t antigen (tag), responsible for SV 40 's transforming and oncogenic properties. These antigens block tumour suppressor gene products, such as p 53. We considered the possibility of reverting this effect by adding exogenous wild-type p 53 and thus restoring normal cell functions. For this purpose, we developed a recombinant adenovirus carrying complementary DNA (cDNA) for wild type p 53 (AdCMV. p 53) and infected mesothelioma cell lines with this virus. Inhibition of proliferation, halting of the cell cycle and massive apoptosis was observed in all mesothelioma cell lines tested. In addition, proliferation of human mesothelioma tumours into nude mice was inhibited by in vivo adenovirus-mediated p 53 transgene expression. We also report preliminary evidence of expression, by immunoreactivity, of the extracellular matrix protein tenascin in human malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>mesotheliomas.</b> It was interesting to find predominant tenascin positivity at the tumour's invasive edge and in areas of tumour vascularization.

Monoclonal antibodies 44 - 3 A 6 and 624 A 12 were raised against human pulmonary carcinoma cell lines; they recognize a membrane-associated protein of 40, 000 mol wt and a specific sugar sequence of lacto-N-fucopentose III, respectively. Samples were also studied with a broad-spectrum antikeratin antibody and a polyclonal antibody to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). These investigations {{were performed on}} formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues. The mesotheliomas comprised only grossly evident, pleurectomized, or pneumonectomized cases; they included 22 epithelial, 15 biphasic, and 6 spindle cell types. Electron-microscopic study was also done on 9 cases. None of the mesotheliomas was immunoreactive to 624 A 12, while 9 / 10 metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinomas were convincingly immunoreactive. Monoclonal antibody 44 - 3 A 6 immunostained all of the metastatic adenocarcinomas strongly, whereas only 10 / 43 mesotheliomas were focally and weakly immunoreactive. The latter included 5 epithelial and 4 biophasic mesotheliomas and 1 spindle cell mesotheliomas; the immunoreaction was confined to scattered single cells, and the staining pattern was readily discernible from that of adenocarcinomas. Forty of 43 mesotheliomas were strongly immunoreactive with the broad-spectrum anti-keratin antibody, whereas 8 / 10 metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinomas showed focal and rather weak staining. Seven of 10 metastatic adenocarcinomas were immunoreactive to anti-CEA antibody, while only 15 / 43 mesotheliomas displayed weak immunoreactivity. It is concluded that monoclonal antibodies 44 - 3 A 6 and 624 A 12 are excellent phenotypic markers of metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinomas to the pleura and thus are useful for the differential diagnosis of <b>pleural</b> <b>mesotheliomas.</b> Given conventionally fixed and processed tissues, {{it appears that the}} combined use of these monoclonal antibodies may be more effective for that differential diagnosis than anti-CEA and anti-keratin antibodies...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND—Gradual {{telomere}} erosion eventually {{limits the}} replicative {{life span of}} somatic cells and is regarded as an ultimate tumour suppressor mechanism, eliminating cells that have accumulated genetic alterations. Telomerase, which {{has been found in}} over 85 % of human cancers, elongates telomeres and may be required for tumorigenesis by the process of immortalisation. Malignant mesothelioma is an incurable malignancy with a poor prognosis. The disease becomes symptomatic decades after exposure to carcinogenic asbestos fibres, suggesting the long term survival of pre-malignant cell clones. This study investigated the presence of telomerase in <b>pleural</b> malignant <b>mesothelioma,</b> which may be the target for future anti-telomerase drugs.  METHODS—Telomerase activity was semi-quantitatively measured in extracts from 22 primary <b>pleural</b> <b>mesotheliomas,</b> two benign solitary fibrous tumours of the pleura, four mesothelioma cell lines, and six short term mesothelial cell cultures from normal pleura using a non-isotopic dilution assay of the telomeric repeat amplification protocol.  RESULTS—Twenty of the 22 primary mesotheliomas (91 %) and all tumour derived mesothelioma cell lines were telomerase positive. Different levels of enzyme activity were observed in the tumours of different histological subtypes. Telomerase activity could not be detected in the six normal mesothelial cell cultures or in the two mesotheliomas. Both benign solitary fibrous tumours showed strong telomerase activity.  CONCLUSIONS—Telomerase activity is found in a high proportion of mesotheliomas and anti-telomerase drugs might therefore be useful clinically. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that telomerase activity may be a feature of carcinogenesis in mesotheliomas and possibly in many other cancers. ...|$|R
40|$|Malignant <b>pleural</b> <b>mesotheliomas</b> is in {{most cases}} {{associated}} with elevated amounts of hyaluronan. To investigate the importance of hyaluronan for the malignant properties of mesotheliomas, we have expressed murine hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS 2) in the non-hyaluronan producing mesothelioma cell line, Mero- 25. We found that upon hyaluronan overproduction the mesothelioma cells changed their epitheloid character to a fibroblastic phenotype and were surrounded by pericellular matrices, the size of which correlated {{to the amount of}} synthesized hyaluronan. HAS 2 -transfected cells with the ability to synthesize about 520  ng hyaluronan/ 5 × 104 cells/ 24  h exhibited about a 2 -fold increase in the expression of the cell surface hyaluronan receptor CD 44 and their locomotion increased compared to that of mock-transfected Mero- 25 cells. Furthermore, the malignant properties of mesothelioma cell clones as determined by the ability to grow in a soft agar assay correlated to their hyaluronan production.
