5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} A.subrubescens are usually solitary, but {{sometimes}} several (typically {{between two and}} eight) are stuck together by the stem bases or {{on the sides of}} their caps. A strictly terrestrial species, it is not found fruiting on wood. It prefers to grow in pine woods, but has occasionally been associated with silver fir in Europe; fruit bodies associated with the latter tree species tend to be less robust than those found growing with pine. It is suspected that A.subrubescens may be mycorrhizal with two- and three-needle pines (i.e., those species that have their needles attached in bundles of two or three), although its ecological preferences are not known with certainty. Ginns, relating a <b>personal</b> <b>communication</b> with David Arora, wrote that Arora encountered several clumps of fruit bodies in an area in California containing mostly knobcone pine (a three-needle pine), manzanita, huckleberry and a few mandrones.|$|E

25|$|While {{there is}} {{currently}} little evidence to support this (and mounting evidence to refute it), some early studies implicated the Ephs to {{play a part in}} the signaling of limb development. In chicks, EphA4 is expressed in the developing wing and leg buds, {{as well as in the}} feather and scale primordia. This expression is seen in the distal end of the limb buds, where cells are still undifferentiated and dividing, and appears to be under the regulation of retinoic acid, FGF2, FGF4, and BMP-2 – known to regulate limb patterning. EphA4 defective mice do not present abnormalities in limb morphogenesis (<b>personal</b> <b>communication</b> between Andrew Boyd and Nigel Holder), so it is possible that these expression patterns are related to neuronal guidance or vascularisation of the limb with further studies being required to confirm or deny a potential role of Eph in limb development.|$|E
