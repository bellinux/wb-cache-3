5|$|The James Bond {{character}} and related media have triggered {{a number of}} criticisms and reactions across the political spectrum, and are still highly debated in popular culture studies. Some observers accuse Bond novels and films of misogyny and sexism. Geographers have considered the role of exotic locations in the movies in {{the dynamics of the}} Cold War, with power struggles among blocs <b>playing</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the peripheral areas. Other critics claim that 21st century Bond movies reflect imperial nostalgia. American conservative critics, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s, saw Bond as a nihilistic, hedonistic, and amoral character that challenged family values.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} {{cinematic}} scenes {{was written by}} Naoki Mori, who joined the project for one and a quarter years in his role: the cinematic director was Shigeki Yoshida, who was brought on {{at the same time}} as and worked on the storyboards with Mori. The initial script was proposed by Fujibayashi based on his perception of the game's structure. As the game's theme was the use of the sword, and the sword most associated with the series was the Master Sword, the team decided to make it an origin story for the weapon. An early element was whether to incorporate the creation of Hyrule, while also needing to explain the creation of Skyloft: this initial stage of story development ended up being difficult as their initial story plans were full of contradictions to established series lore due to them wanting to create an origin story for the entire series. These issues were further complicated by the third year of development with the necessity of finalizing the gameplay and environments. Feigning illness, Fujibayashi shut himself away in a hotel room and wrote the synopsis in a single day. Mori wrote the dialogue based on Fujibayashi's synopsis, who needed to work out the fine details with Fujibayashi. A scene Fujibayashi was intent on including was where Zelda jumped from the edge of Skyloft and Link caught her: this was fitted in for the two characters after the end of Link's exam. The early part of the story was quite different from earlier Zelda titles, <b>playing</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a similar way to a school drama. Once the script was finished, it was handed to Yoshida so his team could create the cinematics. The total number of cinematics was estimated as 79, coming to over 120 minutes.|$|E

25|$|The {{writings}} of Antonio Gramsci and Herbert Marcuse were drawn upon. Gramsci wrote on power, cultural and ideological conflicts {{in society and}} institutions—real-time class struggles <b>playing</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> rapidly developing industrial nation states through interlinked areas of political behavior, Marcuse on coercion and hegemony in that cultural indoctrination and ideological manipulation through the means of communication ("repressive tolerance") dispensed {{with the need for}} complete brute force in modern 'liberal democracies'. His One-Dimensional Man was addressed to the restive students of the sixties. Marcuse argued that only marginal groups of students and poor alienated workers could effectively resist the system. Both Gramsci and Marcuse {{came to the conclusion that}} the ideological underpinnings and the 'superstructure' of society was vitally important in the understanding of class control (and acquiescence). This could perhaps be seen as an extension of Marx's work as he did not cover this area in detail. Das Kapital, his mainly economic work, was meant to be one of a series of books which would have included one on society and one on the state, but his death prevented fulfilment of this.|$|E
25|$|According to Indian {{academic}} Sarmila Bose, {{a significant}} minority of Bengalis, {{especially from the}} Islamic parties, continued to support a united Pakistan and a section of Awami League voters may not have supported secession from Pakistan at all; rather, they were hoping to achieve provincial autonomy. Additionally, some Bengali officers and soldiers remained loyal to the Pakistani Army and were taken as prisoners of war by India along with other West Pakistani soldiers. Thus, according to Sarmila Bose, there were many pro-regime Bengalis who killed and persecuted the pro-liberation fighters. Sydney Schanberg reported the formation of armed civilian units by the Pakistani Army in June 1971. Only {{a minority of the}} recruits were Bengali while most were Biharis and Urdu speakers. The units with local knowledge {{played an important role in}} the implementation of the Pakistani Army's genocide. American writer Gary J. Bass believes that the breakup of Pakistan was not inevitable, identifying 25 March 1971 as the point where the idea of a united Pakistan ended for Bengalis with the start of military operations. According to John H. Gill, since there was widespread polarization between pro-Pakistan Bengalis and pro-liberation Bengalis during the war, those internal battles are still <b>playing</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the domestic politics of modern day Bangladesh.|$|E
500|$|During {{interviews}} {{following the}} Pulitzer announcement, Akhtar {{said that the}} play's title has both a literal and a metaphorical meaning.

Megan Lehmann of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "The hammer-hurling god of thunder kicks off this superhero summer with a bang".

500|$|All of {{the episodes}} open with Bathurst portraying Mark Taylor, a sitcom writer, {{apparently}} performing stand-up {{in a small}} comedy club. These performances are fantasy sequences, <b>playing</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the character's mind and portraying his internal creative processes as comedic monologues; these monologues mainly employ material from the character's failing marriage and are intended to show that [...] "he thinks in punchlines, in comedy". Episodes regularly cut back to these fantasy performances, which usually open with the signature line: [...] "My wife left me...". Moffat felt that audiences needed to know {{from the start that}} the relationship would not survive. However, it was unclear to some viewers that the fantasy sequences were set in the writer's mind; many journalists reported that the character Mark was a stand-up comic, not a sitcom writer.|$|E
500|$|Rob Leane, for Den of Geek, {{stated that}} [...] "this week we {{continue}} to see the fallout of ’s revelations <b>playing</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> gleefully entertaining fashion ... we were treated to a twisty espionage-heavy thriller of an episode". Leane added that [...] "by pitting May against her other self in a well-shot, thumpingly-scored fight sequence, new-to-S.H.I.E.L.D. director Kevin Tancharoen used his experience from Mortal Kombat: Legacy to highlight how far the action elements of the show have come since the early days." [...] and also noted the development of multiple characters as positive. Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush said [...] "I had my trepidations about [...] "Face My Enemy"'s cutesy-looking callbacks to more camp episodes and spy tropes, the kind you might expect from Chuck, back in the day. The hour certainly danced over that line here and there, what with May and Coulson’s only means to recover an important artifact lying in a lavish party, the stock laser grid security alarm, May's mirror image fight, and other such throwback fare, but I’d say [...] "Face My Enemy" [...] ended up more of a celebratory self-aware subversion, rather than {{a sign of the}} season running out on empty just yet." ...|$|E

I look forward to working closely with him as a partner on areas of common interests to the Jewish and wider community". Janner-Klausner has since said of Rabbi Mirvis: [...] "he made some very positive noises about inclusivity and working together and it was really well received. It’s not <b>playing</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> reality, unfortunately." ...|$|E

Mike Lux, a political consultant, stated that some of the protestors in Wisconsin and Ohio carried Egyptian flags and that [...] "the pictures we are seeing and the story <b>playing</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> Wisconsin is like Egypt in some really important ways.

2500|$|Through the 1890s, Remington took {{frequent}} trips {{around the}} U.S., Mexico, and abroad to gather ideas for articles and illustrations, but his military and cowboy subjects always sold the best, {{even as the}} Old West was <b>playing</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> 1892, he painted [...] "A Cavalryman's Breakfast on the Plains". Gradually, he transitioned from the premiere chronicler-artist of the Old West to its most important historian-artist. He formed an effective partnership with Owen Wister, who became the leading writer of Western stories at the time. Having more confidence of his craft, Remington wrote, [...] "My drawing is done entirely from memory. I never use a camera now. The interesting never occurs in nature as a whole, but in pieces. It's more what I leave out than what I add." [...] Remington's focus continued on outdoor action and he rarely depicted scenes in gambling and dance halls typically seen in Western movies. He avoided frontier women as well. His painting A Misdeal (1897) is a rare instance of indoor cowboy violence.|$|E

[...] "I suppose you do not remember the time your mother spanked you either," [...] continued Susan, who seemed to be bent on reviving tender reminiscences that evening. [...] "I shall never, no never, forget it. She was up here one night with you when you were about three, and you and Walter were <b>playing</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the kitchen yard with a kitten. I had a big puncheon of rainwater by the spout which I was reserving for making soap. And you and Walter began quarrelling over the kitten. Walter was at one side of the puncheon standing on a chair, holding the kitten, and you were standing on a chair at the other side. You leaned across that puncheon and grabbed the kitten and pulled. You were always a great hand for taking what you wanted without too much ceremony. Walter held on tight and the poor kitten yelled but you dragged Walter and the kitten half over and then you both lost your balance and tumbled into that puncheon, kitten and all. If I had not been on the spot you would both have been drowned. I flew to the rescue and hauled you all three out before much harm was done, and your mother, who had seen it all from the upstairs window, came down and picked you up, dripping as you were, and gave you a beautiful spanking. Ah," [...] said Susan with a sigh, [...] "those were happy old days at Ingleside." ...|$|E
