40|$|Abundance {{and species}} {{richness}} of the predatory arthropods on paddy treated with Bacillus thuringiensis bioinsecticide.  Application of bioinsecticide from bacterial entomopathogen has not been reported yet that can decrease abundance and species richness of predatory arthropods, such as spiders and <b>predatory</b> <b>insects.</b> This research was aimed to analyze the abundance and species richness of predatory arthropods paddy fields applied by B. thuringiensis bioinsecticide on paddy in fresh swamp area. Areas observed were 2 ha paddy field’s at Situ Bagendit variety. Predatory arthropods inhabiting canopy were sampled using sweep but soil dwelling arthropods were trapped using pitfall traps. The result showed that abundance of spiders inhabiting canopy decreased significantly after B. thuringiensis bioinsecticide application on paddy compared to control without bioinsecticide but the abundance of <b>predatory</b> <b>insects</b> were not significantly affected by the bioinsecticide.

50|$|Another {{conceptual}} model that specifically considers cross-boundary subsidies {{is a model}} developed by Rand et al. (2006) of spillover from agriculture to wildland patches by <b>predatory</b> <b>insects.</b> The edge is permeable to insects that are habitat generalists and therefore capable of easily crossing the boundary between agriculture and wildland patches, whereas it is considered impermeable to insects that specialize on a particular patch type and cannot cross the boundary. In this model, edge permeability (habitat specialists vs. generalists), patch productivity, and complementary resource use (use of resources obtained in both agriculture and wildland patches) determine the expected impact of cross-boundary subsidies by <b>predatory</b> <b>insects</b> (Fig. 1).|$|R
50|$|Orius insidiosus, {{common name}} the {{insidious}} flower bug, is {{a species of}} minute pirate bug, a <b>predatory</b> <b>insect</b> in the order Hemiptera (the true bugs).

50|$|The violet black-legged robber fly, Dioctria atricapilla, is {{a species}} of robber fly in the {{subfamily}} Dasypogoninae. This 9- to 12-millimeter long insect has a wingspan of roughly 7 to 9 mm and short, three-segmented antennae. It's a <b>predatory</b> <b>insect,</b> feeding mainly on smaller flies and predatory hymenopterans. It primarily thrives in grassland, and is seen from May to July.|$|E
5000|$|It is a <b>predatory</b> <b>insect,</b> {{feeding on}} small insects {{including}} greenflys and red spider mites.

5000|$|Creobroter or flower mantises is a genus of mantis {{concentrated}} in Western Asia. The {{name comes from}} the Greek [...] "kreas" [...] (combining form"kreo-", meaning [...] "flesh"), and [...] "broter" [...] (eating); therefore, [...] "flesh-eating", an apt name for a <b>predatory</b> <b>insect.</b> Both sexes have long wings and are capable fliers. Full-grown males are about 3 to 4 cm in length, females about 4 to 5 cm.|$|E
5000|$|The mantis is a {{long and}} narrow <b>predatory</b> <b>insect.</b> While heavily armoured, it is not built to {{withstand}} forces from perpendicular directions. Consequently, its fighting style {{involves the use of}} whip-like/circular motions to deflect direct attacks, which it follows up with precise attacks to the opponent's vital spots. These traits have been subsumed into the Northern Praying Mantis style, under the rubric of [...] "removing something" [...] (blocking to create a gap) and [...] "adding something" [...] (rapid attack).|$|E
50|$|Stenus palposus (also {{known as}} Metastenus palposus or the Lough Neagh camphor beetle) is {{a species of}} beetle of the {{subfamily}} Steninae in the family Staphylinidae. As a <b>predatory</b> <b>insect,</b> it feeds on other smaller arthropods such as springtails. It is now restricted to parts of northern Europe such as Sweden, Finland and Russia, having gone extinct in areas like Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland sometime before 1996. It lives in damp areas of open fine sand beaches {{where they have been}} observed hunting by running their prey down.|$|E

50|$|G. lacustris is a <b>predatory</b> <b>insect.</b> The species hunts on {{or below}} water surface for insects {{and other small}} {{invertebrates}} using their strong forelegs which end with claws. They also have piercing and sucking mouthparts in order to consume other small insects that fall into the water surface and to feed on live and dead insects such as culiseta annulata, non-biting midge, and other water invertebrates. With their front pair of legs they’re able to detect ripples and sense vibrations in the surface film from struggling insects and handle or grasp their prey. G. lacustris eat other small invertebrates and digest them internally.|$|E
50|$|The Salt Creek tiger beetle, Cicindela nevadica lincolniana, is a {{critically}} endangered subspecies of tiger beetle endemic to the saline wetlands of northern Lancaster County, Nebraska, adjacent to and {{immediately to the}} north of the city of Lincoln. It is a <b>predatory</b> <b>insect,</b> using its mandibles to catch other insects. The beetle is one of the rarest insects in North America; surveys showed that 194 adults existed in 2009, down from 263 in 2008, and 777 in 2000. However, efforts are continuing to boost the population, which in 2013 numbered 365 beetles: one beetle for each day in a regular year.|$|E

50|$|Megarhyssa nortoni is a <b>predatory</b> <b>insect.</b> Its larvae are parasitoids of {{horntail}} wasp larvae in coniferous trees. The adult female hunts horntail larvae for egg placement. It smells wood-eating fungus, {{utilized by}} the horntail larvae to predigest wood pulp, and uses its antennae to detect vibrations {{made by the}} horntail larvae. The female M. nortoni curls its ovipositor over its abdomen to insert {{the tip of the}} ovipositor at a right angle into the bark and cuts into the tree until it reaches the horntail larval tunnel. The female then deposits a very slender egg through its ovipositor into the tunnel on or near the horntail larva. The M. nortoni larva then hatches to eat the live horntail larval host from the inside causing the horntail larva's eventual death. The M. nortoni larva pupates inside its host and emerges the following summer as an adult.|$|E
50|$|Infanticide is {{also seen}} in giant water bugs. Lethocerus deyrollei {{is a large}} and nocturnal <b>predatory</b> <b>insect</b> found in still waters near vegetation. In this species the males take care of masses of eggs by keeping them {{hydrated}} with water from their bodies. Without a male caring for the eggs like this, they become desiccated and will not hatch. In this species, males are a scarce resource that females must sometimes compete for. Those that cannot find a free male often stab the eggs of a brooding one. As in the above case, males then fertilize this female and care for her eggs. Noritaka Ichikawa has found that males only moisten their eggs during the first 90 seconds or so, after which all of the moisture on their bodies has evaporated. However, they guard the egg masses {{for as long as}} several hours at a time, when they could be hunting prey. They do not seem to prevent further evaporation by staying guard, as males that only guarded the nest for short periods were seen to have similar hatching rates in a controlled experiment where there were no females present. It seems rather that males are more successful in avoiding infanticidal females when they are out of the water with their eggs, which might well explain the ultimate cause of this behavior.|$|E
