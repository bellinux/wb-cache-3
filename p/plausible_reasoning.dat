40|$|International audienceThe main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to add one more brick in building the CG model as a knowledge representation model autonomous from logic. The CG model is not only a graphical representation of logic, it is much more: it is a declarative model encoding knowledge in a mathematical theory, namely labelled graph theory, which has efficient computable forms, with a fundamental graph operation on the encodings to do reasoning, projection, which is a labelled graph morphism. Main topics of this paper are: a generalized formalism for simple CGs; a strong equivalence between CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) and labelled graph morphism. This correspondence allows the transportation of efficient algorithms from one domain to the other, and confirms that projection —or more generally labelled graph morphism— firmly moors CGs to combinatorial algorithmics, which is a cornerstone of computer science. The usual sound and complete first order logic semantics for CGs is still valid for our generalized model. This, plus the ease of doing important reasonings with CGs —for instance <b>plausible</b> <b>reasonings</b> by using some maximal join operations— without, at least for the moment, logical semantics, strengthens our belief that CGs must also be studied and developed independently from logic...|$|R

Consequently, the nonmonotonic consequence relations that they induce fulfill the desired conditions of plausible consequence relations. Hence our frameword encompasses different types of preferential systems that were developed from different motivations of paraconsistent reasoning and non-monotonic reasoning, and reveals an important link between them. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The recent {{theory of}} <b>plausible</b> and {{paradoxical}} <b>reasoning</b> (DSmT) {{developed by the}} authors {{appears to be a}} nice promising theoretical tools to solve many information fusion problems where the Shafer’s model cannot be used due to the intrinsic paradoxical nature of the elements of the frame of discernment and where a strong internal conflict between sources arises. The main idea of DSmT is to work on the hyper-powerset of the frame of discernment of the problem under consideration. Although the definition of hyper-powerset is well established, the major difficulty in practice is to generate such hyper-powersets in order to implement DSmT fusion rule on computers. We present in this paper a simple algorithm for generating hyper-powersets and discuss the limitations of our actual computers to generate such hyper-powersets when the dimension of the problem increases. Keywords: Dezert-Smarandache theory (DSmT), hyper-powersets, monotone boolean functions, Dedekind problem, <b>plausible</b> and paradoxical <b>reasoning,</b> data fusion. ...|$|R
