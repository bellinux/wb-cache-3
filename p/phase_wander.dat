40|$|The {{following}} thesis presents {{results obtained}} from both numerical simulation and laboratory experimentation (both {{of which were}} {{carried out by the}} author). When data is propagated along an optical transmission line some timing irregularities can occur such as timing jitter and <b>phase</b> <b>wander.</b> Traditionally these timing problems would have been corrected by converting the optical signal into the electrical domain and then compensating for the timing irregularity before converting the signal back into the optical domain. However, this thesis posses a potential solution to the problem by remaining completely in the optical domain, eliminating the need for electronics. This is desirable as not only does optical processing reduce the latency effect that their electronic counterpart have, it also holds the possibility of an increase in overall speed. A scheme was proposed which utilises the principle of wavelength conversion to dynamically convert timing irregularities (timing jitter and <b>phase</b> <b>wander)</b> into a change in wavelength (this occurs on a bit-by-bit level and so timing jitter and <b>phase</b> <b>wander</b> can be compensated for simultaneously). This was achieved by optically sampling a linearly chirped, locally generated clock source (the sampling function was achieved using a nonlinear optical loop mirror). The data, now with each bit or code word having a unique wavelength, is then propagated through a dispersion compensation module. The dispersion compensation effectively re-aligns the data in time and so thus, the timing irregularities are removed. The principle of operation was tested using computer simulation before being re-tested in a laboratory environment. A second stage was added to the device to create 3 R regeneration. The second stage is used to simply convert the timing suppressed data back into a single wavelength. By controlling the relative timing displacement between stage one and stage two, the wavelength that is finally produced can be controlled.

40|$|Of {{the current}} known pulsars, the Crab pulsar (B 0531 + 21) {{is one of}} the most {{promising}} sources of gravitational waves. The relatively large timing noise of the Crab causes its phase evolution to depart from a simple spin-down model. This effect needs to be taken in to account when performing time domain searches for the Crab pulsar in order to avoid severely degrading the search efficiency. The Jodrell Bank Crab pulsar ephemeris is examined to see if it can be used for tracking the phase evolution of any gravitational wave signal from the pulsar, and we present a method of heterodyning the data that takes account of the <b>phase</b> <b>wander.</b> The possibility of obtaining physical information about the pulsar from comparisons of the electromagnetically and a gravitationally observed timing noise is discussed.

40|$|This article {{explains}} phase noise, jitter, {{and some}} slower phenomena in digital integrated circuits, focusing on high-demanding, noise-critical applications. We introduce {{the concept of}} phase type and time type phase noise. The rules for scaling the noise with frequency are chiefly determined by the spectral properties of these two basic types, by the aliasing phenomenon, and by the input and output circuits. Then, we discuss the parameter extraction from experimental data and {{we report on the}} measured phase noise in some selected devices of different node size and complexity. We observed flicker noise between - 80 and - 130 dBrad^ 2 /Hz at 1 Hz offset, and white noise down to - 165 dBrad^ 2 /Hz in some fortunate cases and using the appropriate tricks. It turns out that flicker noise is proportional to the reciprocal of the volume of the transistor. This unpleasant conclusion is supported by a gedanken experiment. Further experiments provide understanding on: (i) the interplay between noise sources in the internal PLL, often present in FPGAs; (ii) the chattering phenomenon, which consists in multiple bouncing at transitions; and (iii) thermal time constants, and their effect on <b>phase</b> <b>wander</b> and on the Allan variance.

Right-handed subjects were required to produce circles with both hands in either a symmetrical (mirror) mode (i. e. one hand moving clockwise, the other counter-clockwise) or in an asymmetrical mode (i. e. both hands moving clockwise or counter-clockwise). The frequency of movement was scaled by an auditory metronome from 1. 50 Hz to 3. 25 Hz in 8 (8 -sec) steps. In the asymmetrical mode, distortions of the movement trajectories, transient departures from the target pattern of coordination, and <b>phase</b> <b>wandering</b> were evident as movement frequency was increased. These features suggested loss of stability. Deviations from circular trajectories were most prominent for movements of the left hand. Transient departures from the required mode of coordination were also largely precipitated by the left hand.

40|$|The authors' goal in {{this study}} was to probe the basis for an earlier, {{unexpected}} finding that preferred-frequency finger tapping tends to have higher frequencies and to be less stable for in-phase than for antiphase tasks. In follow-up experiments, 3 protocols were employed: a preferred-frequency replication in both coordination modes, a metronome-driven matching of the preferred frequencies to each of the coordination modes, and a frequency scaling of both modes. The original findings were affirmed for preferred frequency. Tapping to a metronome had a differential effect on in-phase and antiphase: A more stable coupling across frequencies was exhibited during in-phase. Under frequency scaling, the antiphase pattern decomposed at lower frequencies than did in-phase, but no phase transitions were observed. The loss of stable coordination in both modes was attended by sudden increases in frequency differences between fingers and by <b>phase</b> <b>wandering.</b> The emergence of those effects is discussed in light of asymmetric modifications to the Haken-Kelso-Bunz model (H.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method of {{gravitational}} wave detection using a modified form of higher criticism, a statistical technique introduced by Donoho & Jin (2004). Higher criticism {{is designed to}} detect a group of sparse, weak sources, none of which {{are strong enough to}} be reliably estimated or detected individually. We apply higher criticism as a second-pass method to synthetic F-statistic and C-statistic data for a monochromatic periodic source in a binary system and quantify the improvement relative to the first-pass methods. We find that higher criticism on C-statistic data is more sensitive by ~ 6 % than the C-statistic alone under optimal conditions (i. e. binary orbit known exactly) and the relative advantage increases as the error in the orbital parameters increases. Higher criticism is robust even when the source is not monochromatic (e. g. <b>phase</b> <b>wandering</b> in an accreting system). Applying higher criticism to a phase-wandering source over multiple time intervals gives a > 30 % increase in detectability with few assumptions about the frequency evolution.

40|$|The authors {{investigated}} how {{the intention}} to passively perform a behavior and {{the intention to}} persist with a behavior impact upon the spatial and temporal properties of bimanual coordination. Participants (N = 30) were asked to perform a bimanual coordination task that demanded the continuous rhythmic extension-flexion of the wrists. The frequency of movement was scaled by an auditory metronome beat from 1. 5 Hz, increasing to 3. 25 Hz in. 25 -Hz increments. The task was further defined by the requirement that the movements be performed initially in a prescribed pattern of coordination (in-phase or antiphase) while the participants assumed one of two different intentional states: stay with the prescribed pattern should it become unstable or do not intervene should the pattern begin to change. Transitions away from the initially prescribed pattern were observed only in trials conducted in the antiphase mode of coordination. The time at which the antiphase pattern of coordination became unstable was {{not found to be}} influenced by the intentional state. In addition, the do-not-intervene set led to a switch to an in-phase pattern of coordination whereas the stay set led to <b>phase</b> <b>wandering.</b> Those findings are discussed within the framework of a dynamic account of bimanual coordination...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{periodic}} nature of detailed structure (particularly dips) in the RXTE/ASM lightcurve of Circinus X- 1. The significant <b>phase</b> <b>wandering</b> of the X-ray maxima suggests their {{identification with the}} response on a viscous timescale of the accretion disk to perturbation. We find that the X-ray dips provide a more accurate system clock than the maxima, and thus use these as indicators of the times of periastron passage. We fit a quadratic ephemeris to these dips, and find its predictive power for the X-ray lightcurve to be superior to ephemerides based on the radio flares and the full archival X-ray lightcurve. Under {{the hypothesis that the}} dips are tracers of the mass transfer rate from the donor, we use their occurrence rate as a function of orbital phase to explore the (as yet unconstrained) nature of the donor. The high Ṗ term in the ephemeris provides another piece of evidence that Cir X- 1 {{is in a state of}} dynamical evolution, and thus is a very young post-supernova system. We further suggest that the radio "synchrotron nebula" immediately surrounding Cir X- 1 is in fact the remnant of the event that created the compact object, and discuss briefly the evidence for and against such an interpretation.

On each block of trials, the wrist of the response hand {{was placed in a}} extended, neutral or flexed position. In the flex-on-the-beat condition, subjects were instructed to coordinate maximum excursion in the direction of finger flexion with each beat of the metronome. In the extend-on-the-beat condition, subjects were instructed to coordinate maximum excursion in the direction of finger extension with each beat of the metronome. The frequency of the metronome was increased from 2. 00 Hz to 3. 75 Hz in 8 steps (8 s epochs) of 0. 25 Hz. During trials prepared in the extend-on-the-beat pattern, all subjects exhibited transitions to either a flex-on-the-beat pattern or to <b>phase</b> <b>wandering</b> as the frequency of pacing was increased. The time at which these transitions occurred was reliably influenced by the position of the wrist. Four subjects exhibited qualitative departures from the flex-on-the-beat pattern at pacing frequencies that were greater than those at which the extend-on-the-beat pattern could be maintained. The lime at which these departures occurred was not influenced by the position of the wrist. These results are discussed with reference to the constraints imposed on the coordination dynamics by the intrinsic properties of the neuromuscular-skeletal system...|$|R
40|$|The {{coordination}} of body movements to a musical beat {{is a common}} feature of many dance styles. However, the auditory-motor coordination skills of dancers remain largely uninvestigated. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the auditory-motor coordination skills of non-dancers, street dancers, and the winner of a celebrated international street dance competition, while coordinating their rhythmic finger movements to a beat. The beat rate of a metronome increased from 1. 0 to 3. 7 Hz. The participants were asked to either flex or extend their index fingers on the beat in each condition. Under the extend-on-the-beat condition, both the dancers and non-dancers showed a spontaneous transition from the extend-on-the-beat to the flex-on-the-beat or to a <b>phase</b> <b>wandering</b> pattern. However, the critical frequency at which the transition occurred was significantly higher in the dancers (3. 3 Hz) than in the non-dancers (2. 6 Hz). Under the flex-on-the-beat condition, the dancers were able to maintain their coordination pattern more stably at high beat rates compared to the non-dancers. Furthermore, the world champion matched the timing of movement peak velocity to the beat across the different beat rates. This may give a sense of unity between the movement and the beat for the audience because the peak velocity of the rhythmic movement works as a temporal cue for the audiovisual synchrony perception. These results suggest that the skills of accomplished dancers lie in their small finger movements and that the sensorimotor learning of street dance is characterized by a stabilization of the coordination patterns, including the inhibition of an unintentional transition to other coordination patterns...|$|R

An understanding of the spatial behaviour of this crayfish could be the baseline for future research aimed at control and management. Following the same pattern as other fresh-water decapods, P. clarkii, studied in an irrigation ditch system in Florence, Tuscany, displayed sta-tionary phases (several marked individuals were recaptured in the area) interposed with nomadic bursts of movement (many marked crayfish disappeared). With a few exceptions, nocturnal activity prevailed in almost all the seasons in two different analysed habitats (irrigation ditches and the Massaciuccoli Lake, Lucca). However, in the laboratory, locomotion occurred mostly at day-time. Although still prevailing, P. clarkii’s nocturnal activity appeared puzzling, because some of its major predators are nocturnal and this species is mostly herbivorous.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of EntomologyFrank ArthurThe {{control of}} Indianmeal moth [Plodia interpunctella (Hübner) ], a {{commonly}} found serious stored product pest around the world, relies mainly upon chemical control methods. Because of {{recent changes in}} the laws and regulations governing pesticide usage in the United States, there is an increasing need for finding safer chemicals to control insect pests. Hydroprene, an insect growth regulator, {{is considered to be}} a safe alternative. In this study, I quantified the effects of hydroprene on two critical life stages of Indianmeal moth, the eggs and 5 th instar <b>wandering</b> <b>phase</b> larvae. Maximum development time in the untreated controls was 13. 6 ± 0. 6 d at 16 °C and minimum development time was 2. 3 ± 0. 4 d at 32 °C. At 20 °C and 24 °C, the effect of hydroprene on egg development became more evident; development time generally increased with exposure interval, with some variability in the data. The mean egg mortality among all temperatures was 7. 3 ± 4. 6 %. Among the treatments, mortality of eggs increased as the exposure periods increased within any given temperature, with a dramatic increase in mortality with increase in temperature. Egg mortality was lowest at 16 °C when exposed for 1 h (0 ± 3 %), but mortality gradually increased up to 32 ± 3 % when exposed for 18 h. Within each exposure interval, there was a direct increase in mortality as the temperatures increased. For the 5 th instar <b>wandering</b> <b>phase</b> larvae, the longest development time among the treatments of 47. 2 ± 1. 3 d occurred at 16 ºC when the larvae were exposed for 30 h, whereas the shortest development time of 7. 0 ± 0. 5 d occurred when the larvae were exposed for 1 h at 32 ºC. Among treatments, the greatest larval mortality (82. 0 ± 0. 1 %) occurred when larvae were exposed for 30 h at 28 ºC, while the minimum mortality of 0. 0 ± 0. 5 % occurred at 16 ºC when larvae were exposed for 1 h.

40|$|A neural {{mechanism}} coordinates pupariation {{behavior and}} tanning in the tsetse larva. At parturition, the mature larva has already received sufficient ecdysteroid {{to commit the}} epidermal cells to metamorphosis but, before sclerotization and tanning of the cuticle can begin, the larva must first select a pupariation site and then proceed through a stereotypic sequence of pupariation behavior that culminates {{in the formation of}} a smooth, ovoid puparium. Both pupariation behavior and tanning are inhibited by the central nervous system (CNS) during the <b>wandering</b> <b>phase.</b> This central inhibition is maintained by sensory input originating in the extreme posterior region of the body. At the transition from wandering to pupariation, the posterior signal that induces inhibition of pupariation behavior is removed and the larva begins the contractions associated with pupariation, but the CNS inhibition of tanning persists. At this point, separation of the body into two halves by ligation or nerve transection prevents tanning of the anterior half (containing the CNS), whereas the denervated integument of the posterior half tans completely. Transection of nerves to the midline of the body produces larvae with a tanning pattern that ends abruptly along a sagittal plane, implying that the central control of this proces...|$|R
40|$|At {{continental}} margins, {{the water}} content and its distribution {{play an important}} role in the subduction process. Water is released from the subducting slab in a series of metamorphic reactions and may trigger the onset of melting, cause crustal weakening and changes in the dynamics and thermal structure of subduction zones. However, the amount of water carried into the subduction zone and its distribution are not well constrained by existing data. They are subject of vigorous current research in the special research initiative (SFB 574) at University of Kiel and IFM-GEOMAR “Volatiles and Fluids in Subduction Zones: Climate Feedback and Trigger Mechanisms for Natural Disasters”. Electromagnetic methods like magnetotellurics have been widely used to recognize fluid release and melt production through enhanced electrical conductivities. In the framework of SFB 574, an offshore magnetotelluric experiment was performed in 2007 - 2008 along a profile crossing the trench, where the Cocos plate is thrust beneath the Caribbean plate. The marine profile was extended onshore by the Free University of Berlin, yielding a large-scale amphibious data set across the subduction zone with a profile length of 370 km. The main goal of the experiment is to image the fluid content and its distribution along the subducting plate and deeper Earth structure. The recorded electromagnetic time series have been processed to electromagnetic sounding curves (apparent resistivity & phase, and Tipper) at each station. As most of the stations lay on a cliffy continental shelf, they were highly susceptible to water enforced movement (tidal currents hitting the shelf). The data quality of the recorded electromagnetic time series therefore ranges from very good to noisy, depending on the instrument’s position and stability. Only quiet sections are used for the processing. In the subsequently derived marine transfer functions a distortion due to the so-called “coast effect” is visible at specific period and distance to the coast (apexes in apparent resistivity curves occur in the transvers-electric (TE) mode, accompanied by <b>phases</b> <b>wandering</b> through all four quadrants and abnormally high Tipper values). A detailed modeling study is performed in order to explain and quantify the coastal distortion. The modeling study reveals that the presence of a coast affects the marine transfer functions with a specific signature, which depends on several physical parameters, such as distance from the coast, period, ocean depth and bulk resistivity. Approximations are derived that define a “characteristic period” and “characteristic distance” from the coast at which the distortion is expected to be most pronounced in the transfer functions. The distortion due to the coast is shown to be helpful as it allows the estimation of the bulk resistivity of the subsurface and furthermore increases the sensitivity of the electromagnetic response to conductivity anomalies at depth. The recorded marine transfer functions were inverted together with the land transfer functions to an electrical resistivity model of the subduction zone down to a depth of approximately 120 km. Based on the model the hydration and dehydration cycle of a subduction zone may be derived. An electrically conductive zone in the incoming plate outer rise is associated with sea water penetrating down extensional faults and cracks into the upper mantle. Along the downward subducting plate, distinct conductive anomalies identify fluids from dehydration processes in the sediments, crust and mantle. A conductivity anomaly at a depth of approximately 12 km and at a distance of 65 km from the trench is associated with a first major dehydration reaction of minerally-bound water. This is of importance in the context of mid-slope fluid seeps which are thought to significantly contribute to the recycling of minerally-bound water. Another fluid accumulation is revealed by a conductivity anomaly at 20 - 30 km depth and a distance of approximately 30 km seaward from the volcanic arc. This lower crustal fluid accumulation could likely be caused by trapping of fluids released due to de-serpentinization processes or due to other mineral dehydration processes. A comparison with other electromagnetic studies from subduction zones around the world reveal that such a conductivity anomaly is a global feature suggesting the presence of a global fluid sink. This sink may help to explain the general observed deficit between water input and output in a subduction cycle. By relating seismic evidence as well as petrological results collected in the multi-disciplinary study of Costa Rica, budget estimations for the water cycle in the subduction zone are introduced...|$|R

It has roles in innate behaviors such as larval locomotion and adult courtship. In performing tissue-specific knockdown with the Gal 4 -UAS system we identified a new behavioral phenotype for lov: larvae failed to burrow into their food during their growth phase and then failed to tunnel into an agarose substratum during their <b>wandering</b> <b>phase.</b> We determined that these phenotypes originate in a previously unrecognized role for lov in the tracheae. By using tracheal-specific Gal 4 lines, Lov immunolocalization and a lov enhancer trap line, we established that lov is normally expressed in the tracheae from late in embryogenesis through larval life. Using an assay that monitors food burrowing, substrate tunneling and death we showed that lov tracheal knockdown results in tracheal fluid-filling, producing hypoxia that activates the aberrant behaviors and inhibits development. We investigated the role of lov in the tracheae that initiates this sequence of events. We discovered that when lov levels are reduced, the tracheal cells are smaller, more numerous and show lower levels of endopolyploidization. Together our findings indicate that Lov is necessary for tracheal endoreplicative growth and that its loss in this tissue causes loss of tracheal integrity resulting in chronic hypoxia and abnormal burrowing and tunneling behavior...|$|R
40|$|Ance is {{a single}} domain {{homologue}} of mammalian angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and is important for normal development and reproduction in Drosophila melanogaster. Mammalian ACE {{is responsible for the}} synthesis of angiotensin II and the inactivation of bradykinin and N -acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro, but the absence of similar peptide hormones in insects suggests novel functions for Ance. We now provide evidence in support of a role for Ance during Drosophila metamorphosis. The transition of larva to pupa was accompanied by a 3 -fold increase in ACE-like activity, which subsequently dropped to larval levels on adult eclosion. This increase was attributed to the induction of Ance expression during the <b>wandering</b> <b>phase</b> of the last larval instar in the imaginal cells (imaginal discs, abdominal histoblasts, gut imaginal cells and imaginal salivary gland). Ance expression was particularly strong in the presumptive adult midgut formed as a result of massive proliferation of the imaginal midgut cells soon after pupariation. No Ance transcripts were detected in the midgut of the fully differentiated adult intestine. Ance protein and mRNA were not detected in imaginal discs from wandering larvae of flies homozygous for the ecd (1) allele, a temperature-sensitive ecdysone-less mutant, suggesting that Ance expression is ecdysteroid-dependent. Physiological levels of 20 -hydroxyecdysone induced the synthesis of ACE-like activity and Ance protein by a wing disc cell line (Cl. 8 +), confirming that Ance is an ecdysteroid-responsive gene. We propose that the expression of Ance in imaginal cells is co-ordinated by exposure to ecdysteroid (moulting hormone) during the last larval instar moult to increase levels of ACE-like activity during metamorphosis. The enzyme activity may be required for the processing of a developmental peptide hormone or may function in concert with other peptidases to provide amino acids for the synthesis of adult proteins...|$|R

We have carried out N-body simulations of the motion of a MBH = 3. 7 x 10 ^ 6 Msun MBH remnant in the Via Lactea I simulation, a Milky Way sized dark matter halo. The black hole receives a recoil velocity of Vkick = 80, 120, 200, 300, and 400 km/s at redshift 1. 5, and its orbit is followed for over 1 Gyr within a live host halo, subject only to gravity and dynamical friction against the dark matter background. We show that, owing to asphericities in the dark matter potential, the orbit of the MBH is hightly non-radial, resulting in a significantly increased decay timescale compared to a spherical halo. The simulations are used to construct a semi-analytic model of the motion of the MBH in a time-varying triaxial Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter halo plus a spherical stellar bulge, where the dynamical friction force is calculated directly from the velocity dispersion tensor. Such a model should offer a realistic picture of the dynamics of kicked MBHs in situations where gas drag, friction by disk stars, and the flattening of the central cusp by the returning black hole are all negligible effects. We find that MBHs ejected with initial recoil velocities Vkick > 500 km/s do not return to the host center within Hubble time. In a Milky Way-sized galaxy, a recoiling hole carrying a gaseous disk of initial mass ~MBH may shine as a quasar for a substantial fraction of its <b>wandering</b> <b>phase.</b> The long decay timescales of kicked MBHs predicted by this study may thus be favorable to the detection of off-nuclear quasar activity.
