50|$|The 1970s and 1980s {{witnessed}} {{a renewed interest}} in separations media with reduced interparticular void volumes. <b>Perfusion</b> <b>chromatography</b> showed, for the first time, that chromatography media could support high flow rates without sacrificing resolution. Monoliths aptly fit into this new class of media, as they exhibit no void volume and can withstand flow rates up to 9mL/minute. Polymeric monoliths as they exist today were developed independently by three different labs in the late 1980s led by Hjerten, Svec, and Tennikova. Simultaneously, bioseparations became increasingly important, and monolith technologies proved beneficial in biotechnology separations.|$|E

After treatment with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), peptides were purified on an Inertsil ODS- 3 column (250 × 20 mm, 3.5 μm; GL Sciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan) using a BioCAD <b>Perfusion</b> <b>Chromatography</b> system (Ikemoto Scientific Technology Co., Tokyo, Japan) and a linear A-B gradient at a flow-rate of 8 mL/min, where eluent A was 0.1 % TFA in water and eluent B was 0.1 % TFA in acetonitrile.|$|E
40|$|A {{high-speed}} HPLC gradient {{method for}} {{the determination of}} the antiviral ester prodrug bis(POM) -PMEA and its degradation products mono(POM) -PMEA and PMEA, is described. <b>Perfusion</b> <b>chromatography</b> enabled us to increase the flow rate up to 4 mL/min, resulting in high sample turn-over. Using a gradient system, the three compounds were separated from each other and the sample matrix within six minutes, while column equilibration was obtained in less than 3 minutes. Tetrabutylammonium was used as a counterion for PMEA. Notwithstanding the high flow rate, excellent reproducibility was obtained: the intraday as well as the interday precision, expressed as the relative standard deviation, for concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 mu M PMEA and bis(POM) -PMEA, was lower than 5 %. The applicability of the method is demonstrated by studying the temperature- and pH-dependent degradation of bis(POM) -PMEA. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The EU subsidises {{the use of}} {{skimmed-milk powder}} (SMP) in {{compound}} feeding stuffs. There are indications of falsified SMP content due to the addition of plant proteins. These proteins are not allowed in SMP and cannot be identified by the official reference method. Since soy and pea proteins {{are most likely to}} be added to SMP, manufactured SMP containing 1 and 5 % of these plant proteins was used to develop a sensitive protein identification method based on mass spectrometry (MS). The method included a pre-fractionation step to enrich for plant proteins by using a borate buffer. A very fast <b>perfusion</b> liquid <b>chromatography</b> method including sensitive and selective intrinsic fluorescence detection was developed for monitoring and quantifying the efficiency of the pre-fractionation and screening for plant proteins. After tryptic digestion of the enriched fraction from manufactured adulterated SMP, numerous peptides originating from the major seed proteins of soy (glycinin, ß-conglycin) and pea (legumin, vicilin) could be identified by MS/MS analysis on a quadrupole time-of-flight MS instrument...|$|R
40|$|We report {{here on a}} {{procedure}} to obtain large amounts of a chloroplast-localized heat shock protein (HSP 21) with unknown structure and function, by using anEscherichia coliexpression system for the pea (Pisum sativum) protein and a purification procedure based on <b>perfusion</b> ion-exchange <b>chromatography.</b> After initial precipitation steps, the sample was applied to cation- and anion-exchange on two columns connected in sequence, which allowed rapid purification of HSP 21 in one equilibration and one elution step. The purified recombinant protein had an isoelectric point of 5. 0 and appeared in assembled, oligomeric form (approximately 200 kDa) composed of 21 -kDa monomers, similar to the native HSP 21 protein as detected by immunoblotting in plants after heat-stress treatment. This chloroplast-localized heat shock protein belongs to a special group of small heat shock proteins (sHSPs), which share an evolutionary conserved C-terminal domain with the vertebrate eye lens @a-crystallin. The crystallins are known from both crystallographic and spectroscopic data to be all-@b proteins. In contrast, this paper presents circular dichroism spectroscopy data which shows that the purified recombinant HSP 21 oligomer has a content of more than 30 % @a-helical secondary structure...|$|R
40|$|<b>Perfusion</b> liquid <b>chromatography</b> {{has been}} applied in this work to the {{determination}} of soybean proteins in commercially available cured meat products, enabling the detection of additions of soybean proteins in cured meat products to which the addition of these vegetable proteins is forbidden and the quantitation of soybean proteins in cured meat products to which the addition of these proteins is allowed {{up to a certain}} limit. The analytical methodology is based on a sample treatment (fat extraction and soybean protein solubilization) prior to chromatographic analysis. Fat extraction with acetone and soybean protein solubilization with a buffer solution at basic pH (pH 10 or 9) were necessary to obtain selective and sensitive conditions. Use of water-acetonitrile-trifluoroacetic acid or water-tetrahydrofuran-trifluoroacetic acid linear binary gradients at a flow rate of 3 mL/min, a temperature of 50 degrees C, and UV detection at 280 nm enabled chromatographic analysis of soybean proteins in cured meat products in less than 3 min.

40|$|A {{high-speed}} reversed phase HPLC {{method for}} {{the determination of}} chloroquine and desethylchloroquine in biological samples is presented. <b>perfusion</b> <b>chromatography,</b> based {{on the use of}} now-through particles made of cross-linked polystyrene/divinylbenzene, allowed to increase the flow-rate of the mobile phase to 4 mL/min, resulting in base-line separation of bis-desethylchloroquine, desethylchloroquine, chloroquine, and the internal standard in less than 3 minutes. As the column material withstands prolonged exposure to high pH conditions, the pH of the mobile phase could be adjusted to 9. 5, enabling direct determination of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine by fluorescence detection after elution; therefore, no post-column alkalinization to obtain the pH of optimal fluorescence was required. Interday as well as intraday reproducibility for chloroquine concentrations ranging from 31. 3 to 500 ng/mL in plasma was lower than 7 %. The applicability of the method is illustrated by measuring blood concentrations of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine in blood during 1 week after oral intake of 500 mg chloroquine. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We have cloned and {{characterized}} {{a full-length}} cDNA encoding tissue kallikrein {{from a human}} colon carcinoma cell line (T 84). The nucleic acid sequence of the colon kallikrein cDNA is identical to that of renal/pancreatic or tissue kallikrein cDNA. Reverse-transcription PCR followed by Southern-blot analysis using specific oligonucleotide probes showed expression of tissue kallikrein in human colon, pancreas and kidney. Tissue kallikrein mRNA was localized in glandular epithelial cells (goblet cells) in colon by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Human colon kallikrein was purified to apparent homogeneity by DEAE-Sepharose Cl- 6 B, aprotinin-affinity, and HQ/M <b>perfusion</b> <b>chromatography.</b> The purified colon kallikrein migrated as a broad, 40 - 45 kDa band in SDS/PAGE and was recognized by antibodies to human tissue kallikrein. The linear displacement curves for the colon kallikrein in an RIA were parallel with the human tissue kallikrein standard curve, indicating their immunological identity. The N-terminal sequence of the purified colon kallikrein matches completely with that of purified urinary or tissue kallikrein. These results indicate that human colon kallikrein is transcribed from the tissue kallikrein gene...|$|E
40|$|Two novel type I ribosome-inactivating {{proteins}} (RIPs) {{were found}} in the storage roots of Mirabilis expansa, an underutilized Andean root crop. The two RIPs, named ME 1 and ME 2, were purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange <b>perfusion</b> <b>chromatography,</b> and C 4 reverse-phase chromatography. The two proteins were found to be similar in size (27 and 27. 5 kD) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and their isoelectric points were determined to be greater than pH 10. 0. Amino acid N-terminal sequencing revealed that both ME 1 and ME 2 had conserved residues characteristic of RIPs. Amino acid composition and western-blot analysis further suggested a structural similarity between ME 1 and ME 2. ME 2 showed high similarity to the Mirabilis jalapa antiviral protein, a type I RIP. Depurination of yeast 26 S rRNA by ME 1 and ME 2 demonstrated their ribosome-inactivating activity. Because these two proteins were isolated from roots, their antimicrobial activity was tested against root-rot microorganisms, among others. ME 1 and ME 2 were active against several fungi, including Pythium irregulare, Fusarium oxysporum solani, Alternaria solani, Trichoderma reesei, and Trichoderma harzianum, and an additive antifungal effect of ME 1 and ME 2 was observed. Antibacterial activity of both ME 1 and ME 2 was observed against Pseudomonas syringae, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Agrobacterium radiobacter, and others...|$|E

Both groups were matched for gender, age and body height. BAR density was evaluated according to Böyum and De Blasi methods. Plasma catecholamines by high <b>perfusion</b> liquid <b>chromatography</b> and fasting immunoreactive plasma insulin (IRI) levels by RIA were also measured. Casual (c) and 24 h ambulatory mean blood pressure (MBP/ 24 h) were determined. Radionuclide angiocardiography was used to measure left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), peak filling rate (PFR), time to PFR (tPFR), cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV). Total left ventricular mass (LVM), indexed for height (LVM/H), left ventricular diastolic dimension (LVDD) and interventricular septal (IVS) thickness by echocardio-graphic study were calculated.

40|$|The {{first chapter}} of this thesis {{describes}} an automated system for rapid on-line process monitoring and harvesting of monoclonal antibody produced in a fermentor. Antibody production was monitored for the first 60 hours. When production reached a plateau, harvesting was initiated, which took 90 hours to complete. ^ The following two chapters discuss a flow ELISA methodology for quantitation of mIgG developed in: (i) a bed packed <b>perfusion</b> <b>chromatography</b> media and (ii) a fused silica capillary. mIgG was captured by the primary antibody immobilized in either the perfusion media or the fused silica capillary; secondary antibody with ALP label was loaded and bound by mIgG; and finally, pNPP was injected and the product detected at 405 nm. The lowest amount of mlgG detected was 1 ng with a RSD {{in the range from}} 0. 01 to 0. 04. ^ The last two chapters are devoted to the search for peptides that mimic or could be substituted for antibodies in protein purification. Candidates in this study were peptide libraries or banks and the tryptic peptides from selected antibodies. Candidates were incubated with a specific protein; size exclusion chromatography was employed to isolate the protein; then reversed phase chromatography was used to analyze the excluded SEC fraction to look for binding peptides. A few peptides were found and did show binding to the chosen protein. ...|$|E
40|$|The use of heparin for extracorporeal therapies {{has been}} problematical due to {{haemorrhagic}} complications; as a consequence, heparinase I from Fla�obacterium heparinum {{is used for}} the determination of plasma heparin and for elimination of heparin from circulation. Here we report the expression of recombinant heparinase I in Escherichia coli, purification to homogeneity and characterization of the purified enzyme. Heparinase I was expressed with an N-terminal histidine tag. The enzyme was insoluble and inactive, but could be refolded, and was purified to homogeneity by nickel-chelate chromatography. The cumulative yield was 43 %, and the recovery of purified heparinase I was 14. 4 mg�l of culture. The N-terminal sequence and the molecular mass as analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption MS were consistent with predictions from the heparinase I gene structure. The reverse-phase HPLC profile of the tryptic digest, the Michaelis–Menten constant K (47 µg�ml) and the specific m activity (117 units�mg) of purified recombinant heparinase I were {{similar to those of the}} native enzyme. Degradation of heparin by heparinase I results in a characteristic product distribution, which is different from those obtained by degradation with heparinase II or III from F. heparinum. We developed a rapid anion-exchange HPLC method to separate the products of enzymic heparin degradation, using POROS <b>perfusion</b> <b>chromatography</b> media. Separation of characteristic di-, tetra- and hexasaccharide products is performed in 10 min. These methods for the expression, purification and analysis of recombinant heparinase I may facilitate further development of heparinase I-based medical therapies as well as further investigation of the structures of heparin and heparan sulphate and their role in the extracellular matrix...|$|E
40|$|Based on an {{improved}} isolation procedure using <b>perfusion</b> <b>chromatography,</b> trimeric Photosystem 1 (PS 1) complexes have been isolated from various deletion mutants of the mesophilic cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803. These mutants are only deficient in the deleted subunits, which was carefully checked by high resolution gel electrophoresis {{in combination with}} immunoblotting. These highly purified and well characterized PS 1 particles were then examined by electron microscopy, followed by computer-aided image processing with single particle averaging techniques as described earlier (Kruip, J., Boekema, E. J., Bald, D., Boonstra, A. F., and Rogner, M. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 23353 - 23360). This precise methodological approach allowed a confident localization of the PS 1 subunits PsaC, -D, -E, -F, and -J; it also shows shape and size of these subunits once integrated in the PS 1 complex. Subunits PsaC, -D, and -E form a ridge on the stromal site, with PsaE {{toward the edge of}} each monomer within the trimer and PsaD extending toward the trimeric center, leaving PsaC in between. PsaF (near PsaE) and PsaJ are close together on the outer edge of each monomer; their proximity is also supported by chemical cross-linking, using the zero-length cross-linker EDC. This localization of PsaF contradicts the position suggested by the published low resolution x-ray analysis and shows {{for the first time the}} existence of at least one transmembrane cu-helix for PsaF. A topographic three-dimensional map has been drawn from this set of results showing the location of the major PS 1 subunits (besides PsaA and PsaB). These data also led to the assignment of electron density in the recent medium resolution x-ray structure for PS 1 (Krauss, N., Schubert, W. -D., Klukas, O., Fromme, P., Witt, H. T., Saenger, W.
