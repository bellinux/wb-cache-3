On 13 January 1874 Bergen city council started issuing stock for the Voss Line, to begin with 400,000 Norwegian speciedaler (NOK 1.6 million) was issued. In the 1873 parliamentary election the railway supporter Peter Jebsen was elected, spending {{the next few years}} furiously defending the railway. Parliament chose to not issue new railway projects in the 1874 session, and instead make a complete plan for all railway construction in the country—to be proposed by a committee. When the report was launched on 20 March 1875, the Voss Line was not included since it could not show a higher profitability than 1%. During the 1875 session there was not a majority for the Voss Line, partially {{due to the lack of}} capital available for local investors. This was based on a claim from Johan Jørgen Schwartz, the chairman of the committee, that the investment costs were underestimated. This was countered by Nils Henrik Bruun, a constructor from Bergen, who was willing to construct all tunnels on the railway for less than the budgeted sum. When Jebsen in addition was willing to act as <b>personal</b> <b>guarantee</b> for Bruun in case of his death, the majority in the parliament shifted. On 9 June 1875 parliament voted with 61 against 42 to build Vossebanen.|$|E
25|$|In July 2011, {{it emerged}} that Cameron met key {{executives}} of Murdoch's News Corporation 26 {{times during the}} 14 months that Cameron had served as Prime Minister. It was also reported that Murdoch had given Cameron a <b>personal</b> <b>guarantee</b> {{that there would be}} no risk attached to hiring Andy Coulson, the former editor of News of the World, as the Conservative Party's communication director in 2007. This was in spite of Coulson having resigned as editor over phone hacking by a reporter. Cameron chose to take Murdoch's advice, despite warnings from Nick Clegg, Lord Ashdown and The Guardian. Coulson resigned his post in 2011 and was later arrested and questioned on allegations of further criminal activity at The News of the World, specifically the News International phone hacking scandal. As a result of the subsequent trial, Coulson was sentenced to 18 months in jail.|$|E

To address concerns of the Port of Seattle, the Seattle Mariners, and local industry, a SoDo transportation improvement fund to be maintained at $40 million by tax revenue generated by the arena was also included. Also, all parties agreed that transaction documents would not be signed and construction would not begin before the state required environmental impact analysis was completed. By a vote of 7–2, the Seattle City Council approved the amended MOU on September 24, 2012. The King County Council reviewed the amended MOU and voted unanimously in favor of approval on October 15, 2012. The final MOU was signed and fully executed by Mayor McGinn and Executive Constantine on October 18, 2012, starting an effective period of the agreement of five years.|$|E

Aboard the alien spaceship, the Doctor discovers the three human astronauts, unharmed, but they have been mentally conditioned to believe they are in extended quarantine at Space Control on Earth.

500|$|In an {{additional}} legal issue, on February 8, 2005, Trump had closed on a construction loan of $640million from Deutsche Bank for the project. He also obtained a $130–135million junior mezzanine loan from another syndicate headed by Fortress Investment Group. As {{part of these}} contracts, Trump had included a $40million <b>personal</b> <b>guarantee.</b> The contracts also mandated partial repayments for each closed unit sale, and minimum sale prices. In September 2008, due to slow unit sales, Trump sought to extend both loans until mid-2009 because he {{felt that it was}} necessary in the business environment and expected from the outset of the contract. On November 10, Deutsche Bank demanded the outstanding loan payment and the $40million guarantee. Trump filed suit later that month against Deutsche Bank in New York State Supreme Court in an effort to excuse a repayment of more than $330million that had been due November 7, and to extend the construction loan for an unspecified period of time because of extenuating circumstances arising from the financial crisis of 2007–2010. Trump cited a [...] "force majeure" [...] clause that allowed the borrower to delay completion of the project under a catch-all section covering [...] "any other event or circumstance not within the reasonable control of the borrower". Trump not only sought an extension, but sought damages of $3billion from the bank for its use of predatory lending practices to undermine the project and damage his reputation, which he claimed [...] "is associated worldwide with on-time, under-budget, first-class construction projects and first-class luxury hotel operations." [...] At the end of November, Deutsche Bank countersued Trump to force him to uphold his personal payment guarantee from February 2005, after he failed to repay the amount due November 7—a date that already had been extended. The suits did not interfere with Trump's ability to continue drawing on the credit line provided by Deutsche Bank, because without the project's continued financing, Deutsche Bank may have had to assume the role of developer. In March 2009, both parties agreed to suspend litigation and resolve the disagreement amicably in an effort to help the project to succeed. In September 2010, an amended loan agreement stopped the litigation and extended the term on an approximately $600million construction loan for five years.|$|E

Consistent with conventional theory, collateral {{is more likely to}} be pledged by riskier borrowers, implying they may be useful in mitigating debtor moral hazard. Contrary to conventional theory, we find that banks whose claims are either collateralized or personally guaranteed monitor borrowers more frequently.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} guarantees on interest rates {{before and during the}} recent financial crisis in small-sized firm financing. The novelty of this work is the distinction between real and <b>personal</b> <b>guarantees,</b> and the potential different role they could have played in the bank-borrower relationship during the recent financial crisis. This paper draws from individual Italian bank and producer households data taken from the Central Credit Register at the Bank of Italy over the period 2006 – 2009. Our analysis demonstrates that collateral affects the cost of credit of small business by systematically reducing the spread of secured loans, once we control for borrower and loan risk. <b>Personal</b> <b>guarantees</b> reduce the loan interest rate only during the crisis...|$|R

In the case of firms banks seem to efficiently screen and monitor customers, and <b>guarantees</b> (real and <b>personal)</b> are used to reduce moral hazard problems. In the case of consumer households and sole proprietorships banks behave “lazily” by replacing screening and monitoring activities with <b>personal</b> <b>guarantees.</b> Collateral, instead, is used to separate good from bad customers (i. e., to mitigate adverse selection problems).

Our database covers the period 2006 – 2009 for a total of 560 339 firms and 214 banks.

This effect was larger during the crisis. <b>Personal</b> <b>guarantees</b> show no systematic effect on interest rates, but favour firms’ access to credit. Furthermore, guarantees are a more powerful instrument for riskier borrowers than for safer borrowers, i. e., the decrease in interest rates due to the presence of guarantees is larger for the former than for the latter...|$|R
