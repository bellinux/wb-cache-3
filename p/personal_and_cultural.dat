25|$|In this formula, what {{constitutes}} benefit or harm largely varies by <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> values, but general conclusions {{can still be}} drawn. For example, if the only expected effect of a medical test is to make one disease more likely than another, but the two diseases have the same treatment (or neither can be treated), then ri = 0 and the test is essentially without any benefit for the individual.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} {{retirement}} on subjective well-being {{vary depending on}} <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> factors. Subjective well-being can remain stable for those who retire from work voluntarily, but declines {{for those who are}} involuntarily retired. In countries with an average social norm to work, the well-being of men increases after retirement, and the well-being of retired women is at the same level as women who are homemakers or work outside the home. In countries with a strong social norm to work, retirement negatively impacts the well-being of men and women.|$|E

500|$|Black {{nationalist}} {{poet and}} author Haki R. Madhubuti (Don L.

[...] The New York Times critic Clayton Riley viewed the film more favorably, commenting on its aesthetic innovation, but stated of the character of Sweetback that he [...] "is the ultimate sexualist in whose seemingly vacant eyes and unrevealing mouth are written the protocols of American domestic colonialism." [...] In another review, Riley explained that [...] "Sweetback, the profane sexual athlete and fugitive, is based on a reality that is Black. We may not want him to exist but he does." [...] Critic Donald Bogle states in a New York Times interview that the film in some ways met the black audience's compensatory needs after years of asexual, Sidney Poitier-type characters and that they wanted a [...] "viable, sexual, assertive, arrogant black male hero." [...] In a compendium about the Museum of Modern Art's film and media collection, curator Steven Higgins describes the film's place in history: [...] "Not since Oscar Micheaux had an African American filmmaker taken such complete control of the creative process, turning out a work so deeply connected to his own <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> reality that he was not surprised when the white critical establishment professed bewilderment... depends less on its story of a superstud running from the police than it does on its disinterest in referencing white culture and its radically new understanding of how style and substance inform each other." ...|$|E
