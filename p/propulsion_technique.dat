40|$|To {{gain insight}} into cyclic motor {{learning}} processes, hand rim wheelchair propulsion is a suitable cyclic task, to be learned during early rehabilitation and novel to almost every individual.

Therefore, 70 naive able-bodied men received 12 -min uninstructed wheelchair practice, consisting of three 4 -min blocks separated by 2 min rest.

Both groups received equal practice dose of 80 min, over 3 weeks, at 0. 24 W/kg at a treadmill speed of 1. 11 m/s. To compare both groups the pre- and post-test were performed without feedback. The feedback group received real-time visual feedback on seven propulsion variables with instruction to manipulate the presented variable to achieve the highest possible variability (1 st 4 -min block) and optimize it in the prescribed direction (2 nd 4 -min block). To increase motor exploration the participants were unaware of the exact variable they received feedback on.

The feedback group, which practiced with higher intra-individual variability, improved the <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique</b> between pre- and post-test to the same extent as the natural learning group. Mechanical efficiency improved between pre- and post-test in the natural learning group but remained unchanged in the feedback group. These results suggest that feedback-induced variability inhibited the improvement in mechanical efficiency. Moreover, since both groups improved <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique</b> but only the natural learning group improved mechanical efficiency, it can be concluded that the improvement in mechanical efficiency and <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique</b> do not always appear simultaneously during the motor learning process.

40|$|Background: Handrim {{wheelchair}} propulsion is a cyclic {{skill that}} needs to be learned during rehabilitation. It has been suggested that more variability in <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique</b> benefits the motor learning process of wheelchair propulsion. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the influence of variable practice on the motor learning outcomes of wheelchair propulsion in able-bodied participants. Variable practice was introduced in the form of wheelchair basketball practice and wheelchair-skill practice. Motor learning was operationalized as improvements in mechanical efficiency and <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique.</b> Methods: Eleven Participants in the variable practice group and 12 participants in the control group performed an identical pre-test and a post-test. Pre- and post-test were performed in a wheelchair on a motor-driven treadmill (1. 11 m/s) at a relative power output of 0. 23 W/kg. Energy consumption and the <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique</b> variables with their respective coefficient of variation were calculated. Between the pre- and the post-test the variable practice group received 7 practice sessions. During the practice sessions participants performed one-hour of variable practice, consisting of five wheelchair-skill tasks and a 30 min wheelchair basketball game. The control group did not receive any practice between the pre-and the post-test. Results: Comparison of the pre-and the post-test showed that the variable practice group significantly improved the mechanical efficiency (4. 5 +/- 0. 6 %. 5. 7 +/- 0. 7 %) in contrast to the control group (4. 5 +/- 0. 6 %. 4. 4 +/- 0. 5 %) (group x time interaction effect p < 0. 001). With regard to <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique,</b> both groups significantly reduced the push frequency and increased the contact angle of the hand with the handrim (within group, time effect). No significant group x time interaction effects were found for <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique.</b> With regard to propulsion variability, the variable practice group increased variability when compared to the control group (interaction effect p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Compared to a control, variable practice, resulted in an increase in mechanical efficiency and increased variability. Interestingly, the large relative improvement in mechanical efficiency was concomitant with only moderate improvements in the <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique,</b> which were similar in the control group, suggesting that other factors besides <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique</b> contributed to the lower energy expenditure...|$|E

40|$|Background: To propel in an {{energy-efficient}} manner, handrim wheelchair users {{must learn}} to control the bimanually applied forces onto the rims, preserving both speed and direction of locomotion. Previous studies have found an increase in mechanical efficiency due to motor learning associated with changes in <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique,</b> but it is unclear in what way the <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique</b> impacts the load on the shoulder complex. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate mechanical efficiency, <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique</b> and load on the shoulder complex during the initial stage of motor learning. Methods: 15 naive able-bodied participants received 12 -minutes uninstructed wheelchair practice on a motor driven treadmill, consisting of three 4 -minute blocks separated by two minutes rest. Practice was performed at a fixed belt speed (v = 1. 1 m/s) and constant low-intensity power output (0. 2 W/ kg). Energy consumption, kinematics and kinetics of <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique</b> were continuously measured. The Delft Shoulder Model was used to calculate net joint moments, muscle activity and glenohumeral reaction force. Results: With practice mechanical efficiency increased and <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique</b> changed, reflected by a reduced push frequency and increased work per push, performed over a larger contact angle, with more tangentially applied force and reduced power losses before and after each push. Contrary to our expectations, the above mentioned <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique</b> changes were found together with an increased load on the shoulder complex reflected by higher net moments, a higher total muscle power and higher peak and mean glenohumeral reaction forces. Conclusions: It appears that the early stages of motor learning in handrim wheelchair propulsion are indeed associated with improved technique and efficiency due to optimization of the kinematics and dynamics of the upper extremity. This process goes at the cost of an increased muscular effort and mechanical loading of the shoulder complex. This seems to be associated with an unchanged stable function of the trunk and could be due to the early learning phase where participants still have to learn to effectively use the full movement amplitude available within the wheelchair-user combination. Apparently whole body energy efficiency has priority over mechanical loading in the early stages of learning to propel a handrim wheelchair...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of wheelchair mass, solid vs. pneumatic tires and tire pressure on physical strain and wheelchair <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique.</b> 11 Able-bodied participants performed 14 submaximal exercise blocks on a treadmill with a fixed speed (1. 11 m/s) within 3 weeks to determine the effect of tire pressure (100 %, 75 %, 50 %, 25 % of the recommended value), wheelchair mass (0 kg, 5 kg, or 10 kg extra) and tire type (pneumatic vs. solid). All test conditions (except pneumatic vs. solid) were performed with and without instrumented measurement wheels. Outcome measures were power output (PO), physical strain (heart rate (HR), oxygen uptake (VO 2), gross mechanical efficiency (ME)) and <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique</b> (timing, force application). At 25 % tire pressure PO and subsequently VO 2 were higher compared to 100 % tire pressure. Furthermore, a higher tire pressure led to a longer cycle time and contact angle and subsequently lower push frequency. Extra mass did not lead to an increase in PO, physical strain or <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique.</b> Solid tires led to a higher PO and physical strain. The solid tire effect was amplified by increased mass (tire x mass interaction). In contrast to extra mass, tire pressure and tire type have an effect on PO, physical strain or <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique</b> of steady-state wheelchair propulsion. As expected, it is important to optimize tire pressure and tire type. (C) 2013 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. ...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To study {{wheelchair}} skill acquisition in handrim wheelchair propulsion on a motor-driven treadmill in able-bodied male novices {{to simulate}} early rehabilitation. Major content of paper. Mechanical efficiency (ME) {{is a measure}} to evaluate {{the performance of the}} wheelchair-user combination and is sensitive to changes in the wheelchair-user interface as well as to skill acquisition. ME is defined as the ratio between external power output and the energy consumption. When the wheelchair configuration is kept constant, changes in efficiency {{can be attributed to the}} user. Changes in <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique</b> due to continued, often implicit, motor learning account for a higher ME. The changes in ME and <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique</b> due to the implicit motor learning process were studied in a three week learning experiment (3 times a week for 8 min at 0. 21 W/kg) with 9 able-bodied subjects, novice to handrim wheelchair propulsion, simulating early rehabilitation. No instructions on technique or feedback on results were given. Methods. Instrumented wheels allowed for measuring three-dimensional forces and torques on the handrim in real life situations. Combining these wheels during treadmill wheelchair propulsion with analysis of energy cost gives the possibility to compare physiological parameters to the biomechanics of wheelchair propulsion over the learning period. From the force data different <b>propulsion</b> <b>technique</b> parameters e. g. timing (frequency, push time, angle) and force application (force magnitude and direction, periods of negative power) were derived.
