40|$|ABSTRACT In recent years, a {{reduction}} {{has been observed}} in the prevalence of dental caries in the global population. However, caries is still considered a public health problem. Currently, total removal of decayed tissue has been questioned and replaced by less invasive therapeutic approaches, which offer the possibility of incomplete removal of decayed tissue {{in one or two}} clinical sessions. Other techniques aim at sealing the carious lesion or use <b>prefabricated</b> <b>metal</b> <b>crowns</b> on the cavitated tooth without removal of the decayed tissue, preventing direct contact of the substrates with the carious lesion. Recently, ultra-conservative treatment has gained scientific prominence, and is able to control carious lesions through the disorganization of dental biofilm via supervised brushing. Each therapeutic approach has its advantages and limitations, and {{it is the responsibility of}} dental professionals to plan their patients' treatments according to their individual needs, allowing for better functional, aesthetic and psychological conditions for patients by preserving primary teeth until their physiological exfoliation...|$|R
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{fracture}} behavior of severely damaged premolars, restored with <b>metal</b> <b>crowns</b> with limited ferrule and several post-and-core systems, was investigated. Crowns of maxillary premolars were removed and canals were prepared with Gates Glidden drills and with Parapost drills. Groups of 11 samples were each treated with cast post-and-cores (Parapost XP, Wironium Plus) (group 1), <b>prefabricated</b> <b>metal</b> posts (Parapost XH) (group 2), prefabricated glass fiber posts (Parapost FiberWhite) (group 3), and custom-made glass fiber posts (EverStick Post) (group 4). Posts and composite cores and <b>metal</b> <b>crowns</b> in groups 2, 3, and 4 were adhesively cemented. Post-and-cores and crowns in group 1 were cemented with phosphate cement. Thermocycling was performed (6, 000 x, 5 - 55 degrees C). Two static load tests (30 degrees) were applied. During the first load test (preloading) no failures occurred. Failure modes {{from the second}} load test were categorized into favorable and unfavorable failures. Mean failure loads among the four groups (group 1, 1, 845 N; group 2, 1, 718 N; group 3, 1, 812 N; and group 4, 1, 514 N) were not significantly different. Unfavorable failures were root fractures and favorable failures were postcrown displacements. No differences in frequencies of unfavorable/favorable failures were seen among the groups. The results suggest that different post-and-core systems have no influence on the fracture behavior of severely damaged premolars restored with <b>metal</b> <b>crowns</b> with limited ferrule...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{aim of this}} {{long-term}} {{follow-up study}} was to collect up to 17 years of survival data of endodontically treated single teeth {{with or without a}} <b>prefabricated</b> <b>metal</b> post. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single teeth were provided with direct composite resin core-crown reconstructions with or without posts by 15 operators. Restorations consisted of either a <b>prefabricated</b> <b>metal</b> post and a composite core-crown reconstruction or a post-free direct composite reconstruction. Allocation of either restoration was performed by balanced drawing. These restorations were not covered by an artificial crown. The study sample consisted of 87 patients who received 98 core-crown reconstructions. The performance of the restorations was evaluated based on data collected from the files of the clinicians currently monitoring the oral health of the patients. The survival probability was analyzed at different levels: on the restoration level and on the level of the tooth carrying the restoration. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare survival probabilities. RESULTS: Post placement showed no influence on the survival probability at either level (P >. 05). The estimated overall survival rate at 17 years was 53 % +/- 14 % at the restoration level and 79 % +/- 11 % at the tooth level. CONCLUSION: The results of this long-term follow-up study showed no difference in survival probabilities between different direct composite resin core-crown reconstructions of endodontically treated single teeth (with or without a post) ...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare the oral stereognostic ability and satisfaction for fixed prosthesis in human being. Materials and Methods: The present study was carried out on 40 subjects, the purpose being to investigate the relation of oral perception to diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Two types of cast metal crowns-one had morphology closely resembling original tooth and other one confirmed to ideal contours were constructed on endodontically treated posterior tooth. One cast <b>metal</b> <b>crown</b> was randomly selected from two cast <b>metal</b> <b>crown</b> and fitted on prepared tooth. Oral stereognostic score of subject was determined by correct response to questionnaire based on the recognition ability of subjects. Patient satisfaction level was checked by psychometric parameter Likert scale. Same procedure was repeated with other type of cast <b>metal</b> <b>crown.</b> Results: Data obtained were compared by paired and unpaired two sample t-test. Oral stereognostic score and satisfaction score were found to be higher for cast <b>metal</b> <b>crown</b> with morphology resembling to original tooth due to recognition and discriminatory ability of subjects and recall-memory. Oral stereognostic level was found to be higher in younger than older subjects. The level of satisfaction was found to be higher in older subjects than younger subjects. Conclusion: It was concluded that acceptance of fixed prosthesis is not only based on dentist′s routine procedure of treatment and patient′s judgment about oral health, function, and esthetics, but also depends upon patient′s oral perception and discriminatory skill for external morphology of fixed prosthesis...|$|R
