50|$|The Convention for the Protection <b>of</b> <b>Producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Phonograms</b> Against Unauthorized Duplication <b>of</b> Their <b>Phonograms,</b> {{also known}} as the Geneva Phonograms Convention, is a 1971 {{international}} agreement relating to copyright protection for sound recordings.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>phonograms</b> {{enjoy the}} right to {{authorise}} or prohibit the direct or indirect reproduction <b>of</b> their <b>phonograms.</b> Phonograms are defined in the Rome Convention as meaning any exclusively aural fixation of sounds of a performance or of other sounds. When a phonogram published for commercial purposes gives rise to secondary uses (such as broadcasting or communication {{to the public in}} any form), a single equitable remuneration must be paid by the user to the performers, or to the <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>phonograms,</b> or to both; contracting States are free, however, not to apply this rule or to limit its application.|$|R
50|$|In {{an effort}} to combat {{copyright}} violation, in 1971, the IFPI advocated for the Convention for the Protection <b>of</b> <b>Producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Phonograms</b> Against Unauthorized Duplication <b>of</b> Their <b>Phonograms</b> (the Geneva Phonograms Convention), which 72 countries signed.|$|R
50|$|The {{domestic}} trade name of IFPI Greece is Ένωση Ελλήνων Παραγωγών Ηχογραφημάτων (ΕΕΠΗ) (English: Association <b>of</b> Greek <b>Producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Phonograms</b> AGPP). However, {{it is generally}} referred to, and branded as, IFPI Greece.|$|R
50|$|The Associação Fonográfica Portuguesa (AFP) is {{the only}} {{recording}} industry association in Portugal. Created in 1989, it succeeded GPPFV (Portuguese group <b>of</b> <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Phonograms</b> and videograms) and UNEVA (Union of audio and video editors).|$|R
50|$|Related rights {{include the}} rights <b>of</b> {{performers}} and <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>phonograms</b> (s. 24A; term: 50 years), of broadcasting organizations (s. 24; term: 25 years) and of publishers {{relating to the}} typographical arrangement of their editions (s. 28; term: 25 years).|$|R
50|$|Related rights vary {{much more}} widely in scope between {{different}} countries than authors' rights. The rights <b>of</b> performers, <b>phonogram</b> <b>producers</b> and broadcasting organisations are certainly covered, and are internationally {{protected by the}} Rome Convention for the Protection <b>of</b> Performers, <b>Producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Phonograms</b> and Broadcasting Organisations signed in 1961.|$|R
50|$|Related rights (in German verwandte Schutzrechte), often {{referred}} to as neighbouring rights as a more direct translation of the French Droit Voisins, are property rights granted to people who are not the “author” of the work in the creative sense of the term. Typically these include performers, <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>phonograms</b> (records, CDs, etc.), <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> films (as opposed to directors or scriptwriters) and broadcasting organisations. Related rights are generally more restricted than authors’ rights in civil law countries, although they may be equivalent in common law countries where both fall under the same concept of “copyright”. They are not directly covered by the Berne Convention, but are internationally protected by other treaties such as the Rome Convention for the Protection <b>of</b> Performers, <b>Producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Phonograms</b> and Broadcasting Organisations.|$|R
50|$|On July 26, 1971, {{the name}} was changed to Mexican Phonogram Producers Association (Asociación Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas) and, {{as a result of}} the new medium of music videos, on May 3, 1990 {{the name was}} changed to Mexican Association <b>of</b> <b>Producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Phonograms</b> and Videograms (AMPROFON), its current name.|$|R
5000|$|The Copyright Act of Japan, {{as well as}} the {{copyright}} attributed to authors, provides certain special rights called [...] "neighboring righs" [...] for performers, <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>phonograms,</b> broadcasting organization and wire-broadcasting organizations, which play important roles in creation and distribution of the works, in order to promote distribution by protecting their rights. [...] Under the Copyright Act of Japan, the right to make transmittable is also provided as one of such neighboring righs <b>of</b> performers, <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>phonograms,</b> broadcasting organization and wire-broadcasting organizations, {{as well as the}} right that constitutes copyright of authors. The Copyright Act of Japan provides that the right to make transmittable shall be exclusively attributed to such performers, <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>phonograms,</b> broadcasting organization and wire-broadcasting organizations. Accordingly, to upload cinematographic works on internet, it is basically necessary to obtain approval from relevant authors, performers, <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>phonograms,</b> broadcasting organization and wire-broadcasting organizations. Under Article 92-2, Paragraph 2, Item 2 of the Copyright Act of Japan, performers shall {{not have the right to}} make transmittable with respect to their performance recorded on cinematographic works except sound recordings. Under the Copyright Act of Japan, basically, rights of performers are established under the principle that performers should collect compensation for their performance in a lump sum when they first permit their performance to be utilized, and the allocation of profits obtained by utilizing their performance afterwards should be determined by the agreement that performers should enter into at that time. Such principle is established in purpose of promoting the distribution of works by gathering the rights on fewer numbers of people and preventing complicated legal relations from arising due to the large numbers of people related to the works. [...] However, such principle basically does not apply to the recordings of sound such as soundtrack to cinematographic works and to upload such recordings of sound, it is necessary to obtain permission from relevant performers such as singers.|$|R
50|$|The Rome Convention for the Protection <b>of</b> Performers, <b>Producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Phonograms</b> and Broadcasting Organisations was {{accepted}} by members of BIRPI, the predecessor to the modern World Intellectual Property Organization, on 26 October 1961. The agreement extended copyright protection {{for the first time}} from the author of a work to the creators and owners of particular, physical manifestations of intellectual property, such as audiocassettes or DVDs.|$|R

5000|$|The sound {{recording}} copyright symbol, {{represented by the}} graphic symbol ℗ (a circled capital letter P), is the copyright symbol used to provide notice of copyright in a {{sound recording}} (phonogram) embodied in a phonorecord (LPs, audiotapes, cassette tapes, compact discs, etc.). [...] Present in Europe {{since at least the}} mid-1960s, the use of the symbol in United States copyright law after 1971 was codified at 17 U.S.C. and is specified internationally in the Convention for the Protection <b>of</b> <b>Producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Phonograms</b> Against Unauthorized Duplication <b>of</b> Their <b>Phonograms.</b>|$|R
