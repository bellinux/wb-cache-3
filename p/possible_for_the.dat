5|$|A comet may be {{discovered}} photographically using a wide-field telescope or visually with binoculars. However, even {{without access to}} optical equipment, it is still <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> amateur astronomer to discover a sungrazing comet online by downloading images accumulated by some satellite observatories such as SOHO. SOHO's 2000th comet was discovered by Polish amateur astronomer Michał Kusiak on 26 December 2010 and both discoverers of Hale-Bopp used amateur equipment (although Hale was not an amateur).|$|E

5|$|Disraeli left {{much of the}} {{detailed}} work to Salisbury, concentrating his efforts on making it as difficult as <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> broken-up big Bulgaria to reunite. Disraeli did not have things all his own way: he intended that Batum be demilitarised, but the Russians obtained their preferred language, and in 1886, fortified the town. Nevertheless, the Cyprus Convention ceding the island to Britain was announced during the congress, and again made Disraeli a sensation.|$|E

5|$|Frank Harold Spedding (October 22, 1902 – December 15, 1984) was a Canadian American chemist. He was {{a renowned}} expert on rare earth elements, and on {{extraction}} of metals from minerals.

5|$|In {{transparent}} materials, the {{refractive index}} generally {{is greater than}} 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than c. In other materials, it is <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> refractive index to become smaller than 1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> index of refraction to become negative. The requirement that causality is not violated implies that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of any material, corresponding respectively to the index of refraction and to the attenuation coefficient, are linked by the Kramers–Kronig relations. In practical terms, this means that in a material with refractive index less than 1, the absorption of the wave is so quick that no signal can be sent faster than c.|$|E

5|$|Partly {{because of}} {{theoretical}} and mathematical difficulties {{and partly because}} of the extremely high energies (beyond what is technologically <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> foreseeable future) needed to test these theories experimentally, there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point to any of these models being a correct fundamental description of nature. This has led some in the community to criticize these approaches to unification and question the value of continued research on these problems.|$|E
