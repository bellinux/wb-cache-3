40|$|For {{the past}} several decades inkjet {{technology}} {{has been shown to be}} a useful tool for fabricating anything from three dimensional objects to electrical devices and biological sensors. From a manufacturing perspective, it is important to functionalize a substrate with material in as timely a manner as possible while maintaining optimal functionality and satisfying hardware limitations. Of particular interest in previous work has been the effect of drop coalescence on print quality. Random variations in drop volume and drop placement make coalescence a stochastic process. Therefore, this study investigates the occurrence of coalescence between adjacently printed drops, considering drop impact, spreading, evaporation, and variation in drop volume and drop placement, especially for a high vapor pressure ink and an ink-substrate system with small contact angle hysteresis. This work also examines how coalescence affects the uniformity of printed pairs of drops and printed lines as well as the functional performance of printed lines. The results indicate that film uniformity and optimal functional performance can be achieved by minimizing ink migration. The results further show that using probability of coalescence as a cost function in order to minimize ink migration is a viable strategy. ^ Since the introduction of multiple nozzle print-heads, <b>print</b> <b>mask</b> design has become a means of controlling the firing sequence of nozzles in a print-head. Given a printing system, this study provides a detailed introduction to define essential items involved in <b>print</b> <b>mask</b> design, such as print mode, <b>print</b> <b>mask,</b> nozzle mapping, and deposition time. This work also develops a modification of the direct binary search (DBS) algorithm incorporating the probability of coalescence developed herein as an error measure to be minimized in order to design print masks for optimal performance. Applying this design to an in-house inkjet functionalization system with Pd hexadecanethiolate onto Si and SiO 2 substrates demonstrates the utility of this proposed design to optimize image quality and device functionality. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} in a {{constraint}} solving approach for automatic generation of inkjet print masks. Print masks are used to control the firing of the nozzles, that is, to determine which nozzles on an inkjet printer cartridge are to spit an ink droplet at each particular instant in a multiple-pass print mode. Many design rules for print masks can be modeled in terms of constraints and cost functions. For example, if adjacent nozzles are fired simultaneously, printing artifacts often result. Therefore, spatial adjacency constraints with respect to horizontal, vertical and diagonal neighbors are modeled with various cost functions. Minimizing the associated, total costs then generates the print masks. Initial solutions are found by a greedy algorithm with some randomization; then neighborhood search techniques are applied to find local near-optima. Our approach can generate masks for Inkjet printers in multiple-pass print modes for multiple-level, multiple-drop technologies. It {{has been used to}} help design the print masks for Hewlett Packard's wide format printers (DeskJet 2500 C and 2500 CM).

An immobilization mask is manufactured directly from a 3 -D model, built using the CT data routinely acquired for treatment planning {{so there is no}} need to take plaster of Paris moulds.

40|$|Light field {{photography}} {{offers a}} new approach to digitally captured images. These commercially available cameras are able to capture the 4 D light field in a single image. This allows for a variety of image processing capabilities that traditional cameras do not offer. For example, the image can be digitally refocused after it is captured and its depth can be estimated. In terms of application, these capabilities could be beneficial on airborne platforms. However, a limitation of currently available light field cameras is that they are not fully functional at medium or long ranges. If these cameras were to capture light fields at longer ranges, they would have a practical application when mounted on low-flying aircrafts. This dissertation takes current light field photography techniques and modifies them so they work better to capture medium-range images. The majority of cameras that capture the 4 D light field use a microlens array to modulate the incoming light before it hits the image sensor. Previous work using <b>printed</b> modulation <b>masks</b> garnered the same effect obtained by microlens arrays. This dissertation details the development of a modulation mask that has medium-range applications. A new way of extracting the 4 D light field from raw images that uses a digital Fourier transform is presented. This method works for images captured with microlens arrays and <b>printed</b> <b>mask</b> cameras. Two prototype cameras were built and tested to demonstrate some of these concepts. The concepts demonstrated by these cameras could be used in the future designs of light field cameras...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{reservoir}} {{management in}} {{oil and gas industry}} relies on accurate water fraction measurement which is produced as a by-product with oil. This paper presents a novel and contactless water fraction (also known as water-cut) measurement technique which is independent of geometric distribution of oil and water inside the pipe. The sensor is based on a modified T-resonator implemented directly on the pipe's outer surface and whose resonance frequency decreases by increasing the water content in oil. The E-fields have been made to rotate and distribute well inside the pipe, despite having narrow and curved ground plane. It makes the sensor's reading dependent only on the water fraction and not on the mixture distribution inside the pipe. That is why, the presented design does not require any flow conditioner to homogenize the oil/water mixture unlike many commercial water-cut (WC) sensors. The presented sensor has been realized by using extremely low-cost methods of screen printing and reusable 3 -D <b>printed</b> <b>mask.</b> Complete characterization of the proposed WC sensor, both in horizontal and vertical orientations, has been carried out in an industrial flow loop. Excellent repeatability of the sensor's response has been observed in 'dispersed bubble' as well as in 'stratified wavy' flow regimes. The performance test of the sensor confirms that the water fraction measurement is independent of the flow pattern, flow rate or orientation.
