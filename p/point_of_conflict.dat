5|$|Shortly after {{independence}} in 1948, G. G. Ponnambalam and his All Ceylon Tamil Congress joined D. S. Senanayake's moderate, western-oriented United National Party led government {{which led to}} a split in the Tamil Congress. S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, the leader of the splinter Federal Party (FP or Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi), contested the Ceylon Citizenship Act, which denied citizenship to Tamils of recent Indian origin, before the Supreme Court, and then in the Privy council in England, but failed to overturn it. The FP eventually became the dominant Tamil political party. In response to the Sinhala Only Act in 1956, which made Sinhala the sole official language, Federal Party Members of Parliament staged a nonviolent sit-in (satyagraha) protest, but it was violently broken up by a mob. The FP was blamed and briefly banned after the riots of May–June 1958 targeting Tamils, in which many were killed and thousands forced to flee their homes. Another <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> between the communities was state sponsored colonisation schemes that effectively changed the demographic balance in the Eastern Province, an area Tamil nationalists considered to be their traditional homeland, in favour of the majority Sinhalese.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{founding}} of Tawau, the region around it {{was the subject of}} dispute between the British and Dutch spheres of influence. In 1893, the first British merchant vessel sailed into Tawau, marking the opening of the town's sea port. In 1898, the British set up a settlement in Tawau. The British North Borneo Chartered Company (BNBC) accelerated growth of the settlement's population by encouraging the immigration of Chinese. Consequent to the Japanese occupation of North Borneo, the Allied forces bombed the town, in mid-1944, razing it to the ground. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, 2,900 Japanese soldiers in Tawau became prisoners of war and were transferred to Jesselton. Tawau was rebuilt after the war, {{and by the end of}} 1947, the economy was restored to its pre-war status. Tawau was also the main <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation from 1963 to 1966. During that period, it was garrisoned by the British Special Boat Section, and guarded by Australian Destroyers and combat aircraft. In December 1963, Tawau was bombed twice by Indonesia and shootings occurred across the Tawau-Sebatik Island international border. Indonesians were found trying to poison the town's water supply. In January 1965, a curfew was imposed to prevent Indonesian attackers from making contact with Indonesians living in the town. While in June 1965, another attempted invasion by the Indonesian forces was repelled by bombardment by an Australian destroyer. Military conflict finally ended in December 1966.|$|E

In Xu, Zhang Fei was appointed as a General of the Household (中郎將).|$|E
25|$|With peace {{restored}} in Germany, the Crown Prince was constantly sent abroad {{to represent the}} Berlin court. On these trips, Vicky rarely accompanied her husband because, due to their financial difficulties, they tried to limit costs to a minimum. On the other hand, the Crown Princess was also concerned to leave her children {{for long periods of}} time. Despite the death of Sigismund, the royal family continued to grow with the arrival of four new children between 1866 and 1872. While the elder children (William, Charlotte and Henry) were left in the care of governesses, the younger ones (Sigismund, Viktoria, Waldemar, Sophia and Margaret) were raised personally by Victoria, which was a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> with both her mother and mother-in-law.|$|E

25|$|According to simulations, a two-lane {{roundabout}} {{with three}} right turns should offer 12–20% greater traffic flow than a conventional, three-lane roundabout {{of the same}} size. The reason is reduced weaving that makes entering and exiting more predictable. Because there are only ten <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> (compared with 8 for a conventional single lane roundabout, or between 32 and 64 with traffic signal control), this design is often safer as well. Research and experiments show that traffic accidents are reduced by 72% on turbo roundabouts compared to multi-lane roundabouts, which have 12 <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict.</b> Research at Windesheim University also shows that turbo roundabouts reduce accidents including casualties by some 75% when compared to regular intersections, and by 61% compared to single-lane roundabouts. The same research {{made it very clear}} that it is safer for cyclists not to have priority over motor vehicles on the roundabout, than to have it.|$|R
40|$|Serbian {{migration}} {{practice is}} the result <b>of</b> often <b>conflicting</b> policies at the regional, state and local level.

Zhuge Liang was {{upset by the}} lack of harmony between his two subordinates, but was unwilling to side with either of them because he appreciated the talents of both men. In 234, Yang Yi followed Zhuge Liang on another campaign against Wei which led to the stalemate at the Battle of Wuzhang Plains. Zhuge Liang died of illness during the standoff, after which Yang Yi and the others ordered a retreat back to Shu. Around this time, relations between Yang Yi and Wei Yan deteriorated the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> – they accused each other of treason and nearly started a civil war in Shu.

500|$|Paul Raibourn {{served as}} the {{president}} of Paramount Television Productions. Raibourn was also appointed vice president of Paramount Pictures Corporation, and, due to Paramount's minority interest in DuMont, was installed as treasurer of the DuMont Television Network. This appointment created another <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> between Paramount and DuMont.

DuMont came to the point where, psychologically, he thought he couldn't do anything without Raibourn's approval." [...] Raibourn trimmed DuMont's budgets {{at a time when the}} network should have been expanding.
