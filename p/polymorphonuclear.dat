5|$|Lead has {{no known}} physiologically {{relevant}} {{role in the}} body, and its harmful effects are myriad. Lead and other heavy metals create reactive radicals which damage cell structures including DNA and cell membranes. Lead also interferes with DNA transcription, enzymes that help in the synthesis of vitamin D, and enzymes that maintain {{the integrity of the}} cell membrane. Anemia may result when the cell membranes of red blood cells become more fragile as the result of damage to their membranes. Lead interferes with metabolism of bones and teeth and alters the permeability of blood vessels and collagen synthesis. Lead may also be harmful to the developing immune system, causing production of excessive inflammatory proteins; this mechanism may mean that lead exposure is a risk factor for asthma in children. Lead exposure has also been associated with a decrease in activity of immune cells such as <b>polymorphonuclear</b> leukocytes. Lead also interferes with the normal metabolism of calcium in cells and causes it to build up within them.|$|E

25|$|The first {{evidence}} for antinuclear antibodies arose in 1948 when Hargraves, Richmond and Morton discovered the LE cell. These abnormal cells, which {{are found in}} the bone marrow of persons who have SLE are categorised as <b>polymorphonuclear</b> leukocytes with phagocytosed whole nuclei.

25|$|Neutrophils are {{the most}} {{abundant}} white blood cell, constituting 60-70% of the circulating leukocytes. They defend against bacterial or fungal infection. They are usually first responders to microbial infection; their activity and death in large numbers form pus. They are {{commonly referred to as}} <b>polymorphonuclear</b> (PMN) leukocytes, although, in the technical sense, PMN refers to all granulocytes. They have a multi-lobed nucleus, which consists of three to five lobes connected by slender strands. This gives the neutrophils the appearance of having multiple nuclei, hence the name <b>polymorphonuclear</b> leukocyte. The cytoplasm may look transparent because of fine granules that are pale lilac when stained. Neutrophils are active in phagocytosing bacteria and are present in large amount in the pus of wounds. These cells are not able to renew their lysosomes (used in digesting microbes) and die after having phagocytosed a few pathogens. Neutrophils {{are the most}} common cell type seen {{in the early stages of}} acute inflammation. The life span of a circulating human neutrophil is about 5.4 days.|$|E

25|$|Within {{an hour of}} wounding, <b>polymorphonuclear</b> {{neutrophils}} (PMNs) {{arrive at}} the wound site and become the predominant cells in the wound {{for the first two}} days after the injury occurs, with especially high numbers on the second day. They are attracted to the site by fibronectin, growth factors, and substances such as kinins. Neutrophils phagocytise debris and kill bacteria by releasing free radicals in what is called a 'respiratory burst. They also cleanse the wound by secreting proteases that break down damaged tissue. Functional neutrophils at the wound site only have life-spans of around 2 days, so they usually undergo apoptosis once they have completed their tasks and are engulfed and degraded by macrophages.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that competence development and biofilm formation is an adaptation of S. pneumoniae to survive the defenses of the host. In particular, the host’s <b>polymorphonuclear</b> leukocytes produce an oxidative burst to defend against the invading bacteria, and this response can kill bacteria by damaging their DNA. Competent S. pneumoniae in a biofilm have the survival advantage that they can more easily take up transforming DNA from nearby cells in the biofilm to use for recombinational repair of oxidative damages in their DNA. Competent S. pneumoniae can also secrete an enzyme (murein hydrolase) that destroys non-competent cells (fratricide) causing DNA to be released into the surrounding medium for potential use by the competent cells.|$|E
25|$|The 196 residue OSM is the {{predominant}} form isolated form {{a variety of}} cell lines and corresponds to a glycoprotein of 28 KDa, although the larger 227 residue pro-OSM can be isolated from over transfected cells. Pro-OSM although {{an order of magnitude}} less efficacious in growth inhibition assays, displays similar binding affinity toward cells in radio ligand binding assays. Thus post translational processing may {{play a significant role in}} the in vivo function of OSM. Like many cytokines OSM is produced from cells by de novo synthesis followed by release through the classical secretion pathway. However, OSM can be released from preformed stores within <b>polymorphonuclear</b> leukocytes on degranulation. It still remains unclear how OSM is targeted to these intracellular compartments.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{monitoring}} of hOCT 1 mRNA expression {{in patients with}} chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) was used for predicting the response to imatinib treatment. However, different cell populations from patients who received various degrees of pretreatment were used for this analysis. Therefore, several biases in the results and their interpretation may arise. We investigated hOCT 1 mRNA expression in different cell populations of peripheral blood (PB) from healthy volunteers and in imatinib naïve de novo CML patients by analyzing changes in hOCT 1 mRNA expression during the first 6 months of imatinib therapy. The hOCT 1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in PB <b>polymorphonuclears</b> compared to mononuclears. The hOCT 1 mRNA expression in total PB leukocytes is therefore preferentially determined by the percentage of <b>polymorphonuclears.</b> Expression in each analyzed group of cells was always significantly lower in imatinib naïve de novo CML patients compared to healthy volunteers. This difference disappeared after the initiation of imatinib therapy, suggesting that CML tumor burden {{and the degree of}} pretreatment at the time of monitoring were both influencing factors...|$|R

25|$|Beta {{hemolysis}} (β-hemolysis), {{sometimes called}} complete hemolysis, {{is a complete}} lysis of red cells in the media around and under the colonies: the area appears lightened (yellow) and transparent. Streptolysin, an exotoxin, is the enzyme produced by the bacteria which causes the complete lysis of red blood cells. There {{are two types of}} streptolysin: Streptolysin O (SLO) and streptolysin S (SLS). Streptolysin O is an oxygen-sensitive cytotoxin, secreted by most Group A streptococcus (GAS), and interacts with cholesterol in the membrane of eukaryotic cells (mainly red and white blood cells, macrophages, and platelets), and usually results in β-hemolysis under the surface of blood agar. Streptolysin S is an oxygen-stable cytotoxin also produced by most GAS strains which results in clearing on the surface of blood agar. SLS affects immune cells, including <b>polymorphonuclear</b> leukocytes and lymphocytes, and is thought to prevent the host immune system from clearing infection. Streptococcus pyogenes, or group A Streptococcus (GAS), displays beta hemolysis.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{produces a}} host of virulence factors in concert, {{under the control of}} the quorum sensing system. Many studies show that inhibiting quorum sensing down-regulates the pathogenicity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, it has been shown that rhamnolipids specifically are a key virulence determinant in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A variety of virulence factors were analysed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from pneumonia patients. Rhamnolipids were found to be the only virulence factor that was associated with the deterioration of the patients to ventilator-associated pneumonia. Several other reports also support the role of rhamnolipids in lung infections. The effect of rhamnolipids in Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence has been further noted in corneal infections (Alarcon et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2004). It has been shown that rhamnolipids are able to integrate into the epithelial cell membrane and disrupt tight-junctions. This study used reconstituted epithelial membranes and purified rhamnolipids to demonstrate this mechanism. In addition to inhibition and killing of epithelial cells, rhamnolipids are able to kill <b>polymorphonuclear</b> (PMN) leukocytes and macrophages and inhibit phagocytosis. In summary, rhamnolipids have been shown unequivocally to be a potent virulence factor in the human host, however, they are also produced outside of the host, for example in a soil environment.|$|E

2500|$|Neutrophils, {{along with}} two other cell types (eosinophils and basophils; see below), are known as granulocytes due to the {{presence}} of granules in their cytoplasm, or as <b>polymorphonuclear</b> cells (PMNs) due to their distinctive lobed nuclei. [...] Neutrophil granules contain a variety of toxic substances that kill or inhibit growth of bacteria and fungi. [...] Similar to macrophages, neutrophils attack pathogens by activating a respiratory burst.

Neutrophils are the most abundant type of phagocyte, normally representing 50-60% of the total circulating leukocytes, and are usually the first cells to arrive at the site of an infection.

2500|$|Competence in S. pneumoniae is {{induced by}} DNA-damaging agents such as {{mitomycin}} C, fluoroquinolone antibiotics (norfloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin), and topoisomerase inhibitors.

On the basis of these findings they suggested that transformation is an adaptation for repairing oxidative DNA damages. S. pneumoniae infection stimulates <b>polymorphonuclear</b> leukocytes (granulocytes) to produce an oxidative burst that is potentially lethal to the bacteria. The ability of S. pneumoniae to repair the oxidative DNA damages in its genome, caused by this host defense, likely contributes to this pathogen’s virulence.

2500|$|The {{cannabinoid}} receptor {{is a typical}} member of the largest known family of receptors called a G protein-coupled receptor.

After 28 days, the mesh and the surrounding tissue were removed and submitted to macroscopic analysis (assessment of the abdominal wall for presence of abscess in the surgical wound and/or skin necrosis, and adhesions) as well as microscopic analysis (presence of fibrosis, necrosis and abscess, counting of macrophages, mononuclears and <b>polymorphonuclears).</b> RESULTS: Adhesions and abscesses in the surgical wound were observed more commonly associated to the group treated with PTFEe. The size of the fibrous tissue was greater in the group treated with polypropylene. Cohort E-A showed PTFEe mesh enveloped by organized fine connective tissue. No groups presented necrosis {{on the site of the}} insertion. The highest mononuclear inflammatory reaction occurred in association to PTFEe when compared to the control group, but the findings for the polypropylene mesh were also significant when compared to the control group.
