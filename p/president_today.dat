2500|$|Originally, the President was {{directly}} {{in charge of}} the first campus, Berkeley, and in turn, all other UC locations (with the exception of Hastings College of the Law) were controlled by the Berkeley campus. In March 1951, the Regents reorganized the university so that day-to-day [...] "chief executive officer" [...] functions for the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses were transferred in 1952 to chancellors who were entrusted {{with a high degree of}} autonomy. As noted above, the Regents promoted five additional UC locations to campuses and allowed them to have Chancellors of their own in a series of decisions from 1958 to 1964, and the three campuses added since then have also been run by Chancellors. [...] In turn, all Chancellors (again, with the exception of Hastings) report as equals to the UC <b>President.</b> <b>Today,</b> the UC Office of the President (UCOP) and the Office of the Secretary of the Regents of the University of California share an office building in downtown Oakland that serves as the UC system's headquarters.|$|E

50|$|All missionaries {{serve in}} a mission under the {{direction}} of a mission president, who, like individual missionaries, is assigned by the LDS Church president. The mission president must be a married high priest in the Melchizedek Priesthood; his wife is asked to serve alongside him.

Mission presidents are typically in their forties or older, and usually have the financial means to devote themselves full-time to the responsibility for three consecutive years. The church provides mission presidents with a minimal living allowance but it normally requires them to supplement it with their own funds. Often, the mission president must learn the local language spoken in the mission, as the missionaries do (although many mission <b>presidents</b> <b>today</b> have either previously served a mission in the mission language or speak the mission language as their native language).|$|R
