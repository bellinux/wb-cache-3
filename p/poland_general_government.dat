5000|$|The {{unit was}} {{assigned}} to security duties first in German-occupied <b>Poland</b> (<b>General</b> <b>Government),</b> where Dirlewanger served as an SS-TV commandant of a labour camp at Stary Dzików. The camp {{was the subject of}} an abuse investigation by the SS judge Georg Konrad Morgen, who accused Dirlewanger of wanton acts of murder, corruption and Rassenschande or race defilement (Morgen consequently himself was reduced in rank and sent to the Eastern Front). According to Morgen, [...] "Dirlewanger was a nuisance and a terror to the entire population. He repeatedly pillaged the ghetto in Lublin, extorting ransoms." [...] Atrocities committed by Dirlewanger included injecting strychnine into young Jewish female prisoners, previously undressed and whipped, to watch them convulse to death {{in front of him and}} his friends for entertainment. According to Raul Hilberg, this camp was where [...] "one of the first instances that reference was made to the 'soap-making rumor';" [...] according to the rumor, Dirlewanger [...] "cut up Jewish women and boiled them with horse meat to make soap." [...] Dirlewanger's primary patron in the SS hierarchy was still Gottlob Berger, who provided Himmler with a massive political boost by numerically increasing the Waffen-SS through his position as chief of the SS-Hauptamt. In Forgotten Holocaust: The Poles Under German Occupation, Richard C. Lukas described Dirlewanger as [...] "a sadist whose brutality was well known ... one of those degenerates who, in saner days, would have been court-martialed out of the German army." [...] According to Peter Longerich, Dirlewanger's leadership [...] "was characterized by continued alcohol abuse, looting, sadistic atrocities, rape, and murder—and his mentor Berger tolerated this behaviour, as did Himmler, who so urgently needed men such as the Sonderkommando Dirlewanger in his fight against 'subhumanity'." [...] In his letter to Himmler, SS-Brigadeführer Odilo Globocnik recommended Dirlewanger, who [...] "in charge of the Jewish camp of Dzikow ... was an excellent leader." [...] During the Nuremberg Trials after the war, Berger said: [...] "Now Dr. Dirlewanger was hardly a good boy. You can't say that. But he was a good soldier, and he had one big mistake that he didn't know when to stop drinking." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Hunger Plan {{directed}} against the population of Soviet cities and grain-deficit territories was unique - the Nazis formulated no other premeditated plan against the inhabitants of any other German-occupied territory.

Raul Hilberg estimated that [...] "in the whole of occupied Poland 500,000 to 600,000 Jews died in ghettos and labor camps", {{in part due to}} starvation. In early 1943, Hans Frank, the German governor of Poland, estimated that three million Poles would face starvation {{as a result of the}} Plan. In August, the Polish capital Warsaw was completely cut off from grain deliveries. Only the above-average harvest of 1943 and the collapsing Eastern Front of 1944 saved the Poles from starvation. Western Europe was third on the German list for food re-prioritizing. Food was also shipped to Germany from France and other occupied territories in the West, although the West was never subjected to the genocidal starvation experienced in the East. As many as 22,000 people died during the Dutch famine of 1944 as a result of an embargo placed by the Germans on transporting food into the country.|$|R
