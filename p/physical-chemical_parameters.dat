The article proposes to obtain experimentally ST (1 ST) time dependence of the controlled aqueous environment and to judge by the equilibrium ST value (EST) about the surfactant concentration in such an environment, based on the previously received calibration dependence of EST on the concentration of respective surfactant in the aqueous environment. EST dependence of controlled aqueous environment is recommended to get though ST measurements by pulsing meniscus method based on the measurement of maximum pressure in the bubble (MPB) without its separation. The essence of pulsing meniscus method has been described. The advantage of this method over usual MPB method is that in the process of obtaining 1 ST dependence and EST value one should use the same air meniscus surface at the end of metering capillary submerged in the sample of the investigated aqueous environment. It considerably speeds up the process of getting 1 ST dependence and EST value of aqueous environment.

During the 1980 s and 1990 s, the main chlorinated compound used in the study area was 1, 1, 1 -Trichloroethane (1, 1, 1 -TCA), which was substituted by Perchloroethene (PCE) in the last 15 years. A hydrogeological conceptual model has been developed for the alluvial aquifer taking into account the presence of low permeability lenses, forming a multilayer semi-confined aquifer. Hydrodynamic tests (pumping and flowmeter heat-pulse tests) coupled with standard and multilevel hydrochemical and isotopic samplings were performed. Flowmeter tests showed the existence of vertical flow between aquifer levels having different permeability. <b>Physical-chemical</b> <b>parameter</b> logs agreed with the existence of a multilayer aquifer. Concentration data collected in 21 wells located downgradient of the different sources revealed VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) levels lower than 100 μg/L in {{the upper part of the}} valley and levels reaching about 200 μg/L in the near shore areas. PCE is the main compound present in the aquifer. No evidence of the presence of TCA was found in the upper areas of the Chienti Valley, but in the areas near the shore, TCA and its degradation products are predominant. Data collected at multilevels located at two sites (upper and near shore areas) to refine the results obtained in the regional survey show a stratification of the VOC concentrations; values of each compound are higher than those measured in the conventional wells during the standard sampling (e. g. PCE: 150 μg/L instead of 2 μg/L). In addition, the vertical distribution of the contaminant reflects the vertical flow pattern inferred from hydrogeological data. The hydrogeological, VOC and isotope data showed that dilution is the main process controlling VOCs concentration in the aquifer. Degradation also played a role in the attenuation of the parent compounds in some localized areas of the aquifer.

The macrophyte species composition of the lakes was found to differ reflecting the influence of environmental factors at two different scales: local (within-lake) and regional (between-lakes). Volcanic lakes are dominated by Chara meadows as deep "limestone lakes" of Central Europe. In high status of conservation three types of Chara community are present at different depth zones. This report describes the available content in the vegetation-plot database Macrophytes of Italian Volcanic Lakes Database (GIVD ID EU-IT- 007) ...|$|E
30|$|Statistical {{significance}} {{of the difference in}} viral load and positive samples (EV) on the same site of collection was measured by the Student test (α =  0.05). Furthermore, the viral loads and positive samples (EVs) by collection site were, respectively, compared using Krustal-Wallis test and analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA), statistical significance was assumed to P <  0.05. Overviews and analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA) were performed to determine differences in mean levels of viral loads among rainfall in three sampling campaigns as well as <b>physical–chemical</b> <b>parameters.</b>|$|E
40|$|The first {{environmental}} survey was undertaken in February 2011. The survey covered <b>physical-chemical</b> <b>parameters</b> (Water depth, water transparency, water column temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and conductivity), nutrient status, algal and invertebrate communities (algae, micro-invertebrates/zooplankton and macro-invertebrates/macro-benthos) {{and the fish}} community. This report presents the field observations made and provides a scientific interpretation and {{discussion of the results}} with reference to possible impacts of the cage facilities to the water environment and the different aquatic biota at and around the cage site including natural fish communities...|$|E
40|$|In the {{sustainable}} management {{of natural and}} artificial resources, the management of drinking water has a very important and direct impact on the population`s health. The analysis of the organoleptic characteristics, physical, chemical and bacteriological analysis {{in relation to the}} quality conditions as recorded in the specific rules is a way to prevent biological disasters that may produce the water in the field of infectious and non-infectious pathology. In his paper we present issues related to the monitoring of the main <b>physical-chemical</b> and bacteriological <b>parameters</b> of raw water used as source in water treatment plant from Bistrţa City as well as undeline the need to improve methods for cleaning water destinated to human consumption, food industry and aquaculture...|$|R
40|$|Nymphaeion {{alliance}} vegetation is dominant floating-leaved vegetation in the Danube–Tisza–Danube hydrosystem {{in northwestern}} Serbia and comprises Nymphaeetum albae, Nymphaeetum albo-luteae, Nymphoidetum peltatae and Trapetum natantis associations. Comparative analysis of <b>physical-chemical</b> water <b>parameters</b> on localities where these – {{in most parts}} of Europe endangered and vulnerable stands – develop showed that most phytocenoses are associated with specific habitat conditions. Of the analyzed water properties, the factors that cause Nymphaeion alliance phytocenoses differentiation are primarily pH, alkalinity and COD-MnO 4. Formation of the Nymphaeetum albae stands is significantly associated with the highest values of pH, COD-MnO 4 and alkalinity, and the lowest nitrate, nitrite, dissolved and the total phosphorus content values, in comparison to the other studied associations. Nymphoidetum peltatae stands develop in waters characterized by the lowest pH and COD-MnO 4, low alkalinity, and the highest nitrate and nitrite values in relation to the other analyzed phytocenoses. Trapetum natantis stands, on the other hand, prefer the warmer sections of the canal network, neutral pH, and the highest values of BOD 5, dissolved and total phosphorus. Habitat conditions in which Nymphaeetum albo-luteae stands develop are of the widest range in comparison to other investigated phytocenoses...|$|R
40|$|We studied vernal pool (VP) {{ecosystems}} along a latitudinal gradient {{crossing the}} Strait of Gibraltar {{in order to}} determine its role in the distribution of VP plant communities. We analyzed flora, vegetation, <b>physical–chemical</b> water <b>parameters,</b> and climatic data from two vernal pool areas on both the European (Iberian) and African (Moroccan) sides of the Strait. Despite the minor distance between both territories, the pools clearly differed in species composition and ecology. However, they showed a similar vegetation zonation in growth forms, including isoetid, batrachiid, and helophytic vegetation. The distribution of the plant communities was related to nutrient load, temperature, and precipitation. Water nitrate concentration was higher in Morocco, where VPs are characterized by Isoetes velata subsp. adspersa and Ranunculus saniculifolius communities. Iberian VPs had lower water nitrate content, and were characterized by Isoetes velata subsp. velata and Ranunculus peltatus communities. We think this nutrient difference is likely to be caused by the different land management regime {{on each side of the}} Strait, with more intensive agriculture in Morocco. Long-term (historical) and present-day (ecological) processes have been proposed to account for the habitat variation in vernal pool ecosystems on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar...|$|R
