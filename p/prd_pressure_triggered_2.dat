40|$|Many {{patients}} with end-stage cardiomyopathy {{are now being}} implanted with Total Artificial Hearts (TAHs). We have observed individual cases of post-operative mechanical ventilator autocycling with a flow trigger, and subsequent loss of autocycling after switching to a <b>pressure</b> <b>trigger.</b> These observations prompted us to do a retrospective review of all TAH devices placed at our institution between August 2007 and May 2009. We found that in the immediate post-operative period following TAH placement, autocycling was present in 50 % (5 / 10) of cases. There was immediate cessation of autocycling in all patients after being changed from a flow <b>trigger</b> of <b>2</b> L/minute to a <b>pressure</b> <b>trigger</b> of <b>2</b> cm H 2 O. The autocycling group {{was found to have}} significantly higher CVP values than the non-autocycling group (P = 0. 012). Our data suggest that mechanical ventilator autocycling may be resolved or prevented by the use of a <b>pressure</b> <b>trigger</b> rather than a flow trigger setting in {{patients with}} TAHs who require mechanical ventilation...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{effect of}} the type of trigger system on inspiratory effort has been studied in intubated patients, but no data are {{available}} in non-invasive mechanical ventilation where the "trigger variable" may be even more important since assisted modes of ventilation are often employed from the beginning of mechanical ventilation. METHODS: The effect of flow triggering (1 and 5 1 /min) and <b>pressure</b> <b>triggering</b> (- 1 cm H 2 O) on inspiratory effort during pressure support ventilation (PSV) and assisted controlled mode (A/C) delivered non-invasively with a full face mask were compared in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) recovering from an acute exacerbation. The patients were studied during randomised 15 minute runs at zero positive end expiratory pressure (ZEEP). The oesophageal pressure time product (PTPoes), dynamic intrinsic PEEP (PEEPi,dyn), fall in maximal airway pressure (delta Paw) during inspiration, and ventilatory variables were measured. RESULTS: Minute ventilation, respiratory pattern, dynamic lung compliance and resistances, and changes in end expiratory lung volume (delta EELV) were the same with the two triggering systems. The total PTPoes and its pre-triggering phase (PTP due to PEEPi and PTP due to valve opening) were significantly higher during both PSV and A/C with <b>pressure</b> <b>triggering</b> than with flow triggering at both levels of sensitivity. delta Paw was larger during <b>pressure</b> <b>triggering,</b> and PEEPi,dyn was significantly reduced during flow triggering in the A/C mode only. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COPD flow triggering reduces the inspiratory effort during both PSV and A/C modes compared with <b>pressure</b> <b>triggering.</b> These findings are likely to be due to a reduction in PEEPi,dyn and in the time of valve opening with a flow trigger. ...|$|R

30|$|Among {{available}} ventilatory parameters, {{the sensitivity}} to patient inspiratory effort for <b>triggering</b> the <b>pressure</b> rise (here {{designated as the}} <b>pressure</b> rise <b>triggering</b> sensitivity or the high <b>pressure</b> <b>triggering</b> sensitivity) {{appears to be the}} most significant setting in pressure support ventilation since it directly affects the synchronization between the pressure cycle and the respiratory demand [8]. A lack of synchronization such as the presence of non-triggered cycles reduces patient comfort and increases the work of breathing [1, 9]. It is thus relevant to assess the abilities of ventilators to correctly synchronize their pressure cycles with patient inspiratory demand. Assessing triggering sensitivity performances is a non trivial task [3, 10, 11], mainly because different algorithms are used by the manufacturers to detect inspiratory efforts. It is therefore difficult to propose a standard measure to evaluate their performances. We are not yet able to propose an external measure allowing to compare objectively the sensitivity of the <b>pressure</b> rise <b>triggering</b> rather than counting the different types of asynchrony events. Pressure rise duration is also a key parameter which affects patient’s inspiratory work load [12], and {{must be taken into account}} for optimizing patient-ventilator interactions. A key parameter is the trigger to switch from the high to the low pressure delivered by the ventilator (here designated as the low <b>pressure</b> <b>trigger</b> or the <b>pressure</b> release <b>trigger</b> and often designated elsewhere as the “cycling”). These last two parameters are easier to compare because they are more or less based on similar algorithms and can be easily evaluated by the pressure rise duration and the percentage of the maximum airflow reached during the running cycle, respectively.|$|R

If the test was positive, a Student t-test (if the variances between the two distributions were equal) or a Welch t-test (if the variances were different) was performed to determine whether the two sets of data were significantly different from each other. In order to assess the disparities in terms of synchronizability and performances between the different ventilators, we performed a Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test, which is the non-parametric equivalent of the ANOVA test, to test whether samples originate from the same distribution.|$|R
