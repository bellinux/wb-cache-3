40|$|Requirements for <b>prime</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> from solar arrays are {{expected}} to increase {{for the next generation}} of spacecraft power systems. An enhancement of the efficiency of the conversion of incident sunlight to electricity would have a number of advantages, provided the cost involved in achieving this enhancement would not be too great. Solar input response can be improved by splitting the solar spectrum into component wavelength bands and directing these bands to solar cells of different bandgaps. Two approaches have been proposed for achieving spectrum splitting photovoltaics. One approach involves multiple-cell systems using dichroic mirrors, while the other employs monolithic multibandgap solar cells. The present investigation is concerned with a procedure which has the advantages of both approaches, while avoiding many of the drawbacks of each...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — <b>Prime</b> <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> {{on board}} all-electric ships {{presents}} several options that affect fuel consumption, power density, operational effectiveness, and survivability. A study that aims at understanding {{the effects of}} some of these options has been conducted and results are reported in this paper. It is found that direct coupling of gas turbines to permanent magnet generators reduces system mass and volume significantly as compared to electric power generation systems installed on present-day navy ships. Furthermore, it is found that a significant benefit this topology brings is a reduction in gas turbine air duct volume if the compact gen-set units are relocated on or near the ship’s upper decks. In addition, a combinatory analysis revealed that the choice of the number of generating units and their respective power levels has a significant influence on overall efficiency.

40|$|Global {{climate change}} {{has emerged as}} a major concern in 21 st century and it has become a threat to all living beings on earth, {{creating}} impact on the biodiversity, food production and human settlement. Among the human settlement, the industrial sectors especially the power sector will face a great threat due to the ambient temperature rise caused by global warming. Scant research has been undertaken to identify the impact of climate change on <b>power</b> <b>generation.</b> The objective of this research is to identify potential impact on <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> in developed and developing countries. The study includes two case studies; a) <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> in a developing country and b) <b>Power</b> <b>generation</b> in a developed country. The study examines impact of climate change on <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> over a period of 100 years (2010 - 2100) in these two diverse countries. <b>Power</b> <b>generation</b> efficiency generally depends on the efficiency of cooling system which in term depends on the ambient temperature, water temperature and availability of fresh water. In order to investigate the climate change impact on <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> in Bangladesh and Australia, present and future <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> capacities have been identified. The study modelled the future <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> till 2100. The climate change impact on different regions of these two countries has been identified. The effects of individual climate change parameters on region based <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> have also been investigated. For Bangladesh, the study identified the effects of temperature increase, inundation, salinity increase, flood, drought, river erosion, storm surge and cyclone on <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> capacity. For Australia, the effect of temperature rise on <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> is considered. The study has revealed that all <b>power</b> <b>generations</b> in coastal areas of Bangladesh, which constitute around 30 % of the total <b>power</b> <b>generation,</b> will experience a higher risk due to inundation, salinity, storm surge and tropical cyclone by year 2100. <b>Power</b> <b>generation</b> in the central region (30 % of the total) will expose to flooding and the northern region (~ 29 %) will be affected by drought. Additionally, all <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> capacity throughout the country will be affected by 2. 4 °C temperature rise by 2100. For Australia, the study found that the <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> will experience temperature rise up to 7 °C by 2100, 65 % of which will face a temperature rise of more than 5 °C. The study also found that the <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> in western, central and northern regions of Australia will experience much higher temperature increase compared to eastern region. Despite, not been estimated the exact reduction of <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> that would be affected by each degree of temperature rise or other direct and indirect climate change parameters in this study, it is widely anticipated that a significant reduction of <b>power</b> <b>generation</b> efficiency will occur.
