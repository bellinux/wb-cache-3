5|$|Indonesia was {{the country}} {{hardest hit by}} the Asian {{financial}} crisis of 1997–98. From mid-1997 there were large capital outflows and against the US dollar. Due to poor bank lending practices, many Indonesian companies borrowed cheaper US dollar loans while their income is mainly in Indonesian rupiah. The weakening rupiah spurred <b>panic</b> <b>buying</b> of US dollar by these companies, causing the Indonesian Rupiah to drop in value from a pre-crisis level of Rp. 2,600 to a low point in early 1998 of around Rp. 17,000. Consequently, many companies were bankrupted and the economy shrank by 13.7% leading to sharp increases in unemployment and poverty across the country. Efforts by the central bank to defend the rupiah proved futile and only drained the country's dollar reserves. In exchange for US$43 billion in liquidity aid, between October 1997 and the following April, Suharto signed three letters of intent with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an economic reform process. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantees for bank deposits, and set-up the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency to take over management of troubled banks {{in order to prevent}} the collapse of the financial system. Among the steps taken on IMF recommendation, the government raised interest rate up to 70% pa in February 1998 which further worsened the contraction of the economy.|$|E

5000|$|He {{was sold}} to Sunderland on {{transfer}} deadline day {{at the beginning of}} the 2002-03 season. Flo's arrival was announced alongside fellow striker Marcus Stewart, and the total cost of the transfers were declared as £10m. The individual prices were not made clear by Sunderland, although a figure of £8.2 million for Flo was widely quoted by the media. [...] Sunderland have since confirmed that he was bought for £6.75 million, making him Sunderland's second most expensive purchase. Sunderland's manager Peter Reid had been under-fire throughout pre-season for his failure to buy a big-name striker as a long-term replacement for the ageing Niall Quinn. The relatively high price-tag for a player who was struggling in Scotland, and the late hour of his signing led many fans, and pundits including legend Jimmy Montgomery [...] to believe that Flo was a deadline-day <b>panic</b> <b>buy.</b> Once again he scored in his debut match, a 1-1 draw with Manchester United.|$|R
500|$|The 1910 approach, {{which came}} into naked-eye view around 10 April {{and came to}} {{perihelion}} on 20 April, was notable for several reasons: {{it was the first}} approach of which photographs exist, and the first for which spectroscopic data were obtained. Furthermore, the comet made a relatively close approach of 0.15 AU, making it a spectacular sight. Indeed, on 19 May, Earth actually passed through the tail of the comet. One of the substances discovered in the tail by spectroscopic analysis was the toxic gas cyanogen, which led astronomer Camille Flammarion to claim that, when Earth passed through the tail, the gas [...] "would impregnate the atmosphere and possibly snuff out all life on the planet." [...] His pronouncement led to <b>panicked</b> <b>buying</b> of gas masks and quack [...] "anti-comet pills" [...] and [...] "anti-comet umbrellas" [...] by the public. [...] In reality, as other astronomers were quick to point out, the gas is so diffuse that the world suffered no ill effects from the passage through the tail.|$|R

25|$|The protests spread so that on 10 September 2000 they {{included}} facilities at the Manchester Fuels Terminal, Kingsbury Oil Terminal, the largest inland oil terminal, and at Cardiff Docks. <b>Panic</b> <b>buying</b> of petrol began to close some petrol stations as motorists queued for fuel which {{was beginning to}} be rationed and reports of garages increasing their prices substantially. Rolling roadblocks were also reported in North East England on the A1 and A55 roads. On 11 September 2000, the government obtained an Order in Council which was authorised by the Privy Council and the Queen to take emergency powers under the Energy Act 1976 to ensure delivery of fuel to essential services. By now six of the nine refineries and four oil distribution depots were subject to protests.|$|E

However, both the AA and fire-fighters have now called on him to withdraw the advice, because of the risk of explosions in garages. The shadow transport secretary, Maria Eagle, warned of a danger of <b>panic</b> fuel <b>buying,</b> as did the AA after the government urged motorists to be ready for a strike-induced shortage. The AA also warned of the danger of panic-buying. Andrew Howard, its spokesman, said: [...] "If people begin panic-buying we could well have shortages in fuel even before the strike.".As the day progressed there were scenes of long queues at petrol pumps in Liverpool, Preston and Kent, while pumps ran dry in Wilmslow in Cheshire and Llandudno Junction in North Wales.|$|R

5000|$|Helicopter ditchings {{usually come}} with little warning, often while the pilot is {{attempting}} a ship landing or other low-altitude maneuver. Because they are top-heavy, ditched helicopters invariably flip upside-down upon hitting the water. The crew and embarked {{troops will be}} bombarded with violent jerking motions and several tons of incoming water, which causes unsecured gear to fly uncontrolled throughout the cabin and can knock troops unconscious. Jet fuel and hydraulic fluid often seep into the cabin and can cause blindness to open eyes and lung damage if inhaled. Troops unfortunate enough to {{find themselves in a}} ditched helicopter will be upside-down, disoriented, often in the dark and in a rapidly sinking bird.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{particularly}} concerned with mean reversion in investment markets {{and its implications}} for investment market regulation. It is now well established that equity markets reflect a varying risk premium. It also seems that they and other investment markets are not necessarily always efficient and can sometimes move to extreme levels. Investors who rely on fundamental analysis of individual assets and asset classes can profit from such movements. Uninformed investors, on the other hand, can not only lose money by inadequate diversification and excessive trading, but also by being <b>panicked</b> into <b>buying</b> overpriced or selling under priced assets. This leads on to a consideration of other errors, identified by recent research, to which uninformed investors may be prone. Most important would appear to be the failure of superannuation members to adapt their investment strategy over their lifetimes. It is suggested that official and industry regulators should take behavioural finance insights into account in enforcing disclosure, and by encouraging a more thorough approach to the monitoring of investment performance. The pressure on uninformed and nervous investors to panic might be reduced by the publication of a consensus portfolio to act as a benchmark. 50 page(s...|$|R

Conclusion Panic in epidemics {{is a part of the}} human condition. The increase in health scares may reflect the absence of real attacks, making us over-react to hypothetical dangers. We should use panic, with good reason or not, to tackle the larger agenda of preventable and curable disease in the world, starting with low vaccination rates in winter flu.

The humanist road leading to adequate healthcare services for all citizens of the world is still long...|$|R
2500|$|In late 2007 to May 2008, {{the price}} of grains rose greatly due to {{droughts}} in major producing countries (particularly Australia), increased use of grains for animal feed and US subsidies for bio-fuel production. Although {{there was no shortage}} of rice on world markets this general upward trend in grain prices led to <b>panic</b> <b>buying</b> by consumers, government rice export bans (in particular, by Vietnam and India) and inflated import orders by the Philippines marketing board, the National Food Authority. This caused significant rises in rice prices. In late April 2008, prices hit 24 US cents a pound, twice {{the price of}} seven months earlier.

Three-quarters of petrol stations were reported to be without fuel. Some NHS trusts cancelled non-essential operations due to staff difficulties in reaching work and ambulances were only able to answer emergency calls {{in most parts of}} the UK. The National Blood Service reported that it was coping and blood supplies to hospitals were not under threat but said that there [...] "were some significant problems in some parts of the country". [...] The government placed the National Health Service (NHS) on red alert. Supermarkets began rationing food due to difficulties in getting food deliveries through and there were reports of <b>panic</b> <b>buying.</b> [...] Sainsbury's warned that they would run out of food within days having seen a 50% increase in their sales over the previous two days; Tesco and Safeway stated that they were rationing some items. The Royal Mail also reported they didn't have enough fuel supplies to maintain deliveries and that schools began to close. [...] The government began deploying military tankers around the country and designated 2,000 petrol stations to receive supplies for essential services. Some deliveries commenced from the refineries and the police supplied escorts as required to ensure that tankers could move.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent protests {{have not}} had as {{significant}} an impact but did result in <b>panic</b> <b>buying</b> in 2005 and again in 2007. The 2007 fuel protests were put together by {{several members of the}} old [...] "TransAction group" [...] from the South of England, reforming as [...] "TransAction 2007". The protests of this period were not widely supported nor did they cause the same disruption as those in previous years. The 2007 protest which took place at the latter end of the year, culminated in 200–300 trucks descending on Central London with the police closing off the A40 fly-over for use as a truck park for the day. Following this, a rally was held at Marble Arch. Later in the day, a deputation went to 10 Downing Street to deliver a formal petition calling for the reduction of UK fuel duty. There were those who felt that the 2007 fuel protests were politically motivated, given that many truck owner operators and farmers would have supported the Conservative Party. The Conservative leader David Cameron gave them his support and promised a “fair fuel stabiliser”, a proposal to limit the price of petrol {{that was part of the}} Conservative manifesto for the 2010 UK general election and was announced to be implemented following the budget of March 2011. The “fair fuel stabiliser” which was meant to lower taxes levied on fuel as the price rose and raise tax as the price fell, in fact tax will still rise as the oil price rises but the tax will be capped at the level of inflation at that time and will be applied twice a year, but when the oil price is falling then the tax can be greater than inflation. Quote from [...] "Overview of Tax Legislation and Rates" [...] section 3.44: [...] "When oil prices are high, as now, fuel duty will increase by the retail prices index (RPI). However, if the oil price falls below a set trigger price on a sustained basis, the Government will increase fuel duty by RPI plus 1 penny per litre. The Government believes that a trigger price of $75 per barrel would be appropriate, and will set a final trigger price and mechanism after seeking the views of oil and gas companies and motoring groups".|$|E
