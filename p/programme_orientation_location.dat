40|$|The {{systematic}} {{inclusion of}} information on orientation of study (vocational vs. general) in the Labour Force Survey (LFS) starting from 2014 will give the possibility to analyse the features and the labour market outcomes of individuals depending on the <b>programme</b> <b>orientation</b> of their qualification. One of the main purposes of this technical briefing is to investigate the possible impact of the addition of this information {{in the context of}} the Joint Assessment Framework (JAF) approach, in particular with reference to the benchmark on the employment rate of recent graduates. In this perspective, orientation of study appears to be a natural candidate for inclusion among the additional sub-groups concerning the employment rate of recent graduates within the JAF methodology. The analysis carried out in the briefing shows a labour market advantage, at least in the short run, of young individuals with VET qualifications (compared to their non-VET counterparts), although with important cross-country differences. However, {{in the context of the}} JAF approach, the current data availability would not allow <b>programme</b> <b>orientation</b> to work in the same way as other JAF sub-groups, thus the recommendation is to add the VET/non-VET distinction within one of the sub-groups of the benchmark, i. e. the already existing level of education.

5000|$|In sign languages, movement, or sig, {{refers to}} the {{distinctive}} hand actions that form words. In William Stokoe's terminology, it is the , an abbreviation of signation. Movement {{is one of five}} components of a sign—with handshape (...) , <b>orientation</b> (...) , <b>location</b> (...) , and facial-body expression. Different sign languages use different types of movement. Some treatments distinguish movement and hold—signs, or parts of signs, that involve motion vs. those that hold the hands still.|$|R
50|$|Signs {{are made}} up of a {{combination}} of different elements from each of the classes of distinctive features: handshape, hand <b>orientation,</b> <b>location</b> and movement. If one of these elements is changed, it can result in a sign with a completely different meaning. Two signs differing in only one element are deemed to be a minimal pair. German Sign Language uses 32 handshapes, of which six are basic handshapes found in all sign languages.|$|R

50|$|Both {{vocal and}} sign {{languages}} {{are composed of}} words. In vocal languages, words are made up from a limited set of vowels and consonants, and often tone. In sign languages, words are made up from a limited set of shapes, <b>orientations,</b> <b>locations</b> movements of the hands, and often facial expressions; in both cases, the building blocks are called phonemes. In both vocal and sign languages, words are grammatically and prosodically linked into phrases, clauses, and larger units of discourse.|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} {{of a large number}} of unique shapes called ligatures in cursive languages, along with variations due to scaling, <b>orientation</b> and <b>location</b> provides one of the most challenging pattern recognition problems. Recognition of the large number of ligatures is often a complicated task in oriental languages such as Pashto, Urdu, Persian and Arabic. Research on cursive script recognition often ignores the fact that scaling, <b>orientation,</b> <b>location</b> and font variations are common in printed cursive text. Therefore, these variations are not included in image databases and in experimental evaluations. This research uncovers challenges faced by Arabic cursive script recognition in a holistic framework by considering Pashto as a test case, because Pashto language has larger alphabet set than Arabic, Persian and Urdu. A database containing 8000 images of 1000 unique ligatures having scaling, <b>orientation</b> and <b>location</b> variations is introduced. In this article, a feature space based on scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) along with a segmentation framework has been proposed for overcoming the above mentioned challenges. The experimental results show a significantly improved performance of proposed scheme over traditional feature extraction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) ...|$|R

50|$|Sign languages, like spoken languages, {{organize}} elementary, meaningless units called phonemes into meaningful semantic units. This {{is often}} called duality of patterning. As in spoken languages, these meaningless units are represented as (combinations of) features, although often also crude distinctions are made in terms of Handshape (or Handform), <b>Orientation,</b> <b>Location</b> (or Place of Articulation), Movement, and Non-manual expression. More generally, both sign and spoken languages share the characteristics that linguists have found in all natural human languages, such as transitoriness, semanticity, arbitrariness, productivity, and cultural transmission.|$|R
