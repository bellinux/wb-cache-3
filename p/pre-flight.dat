5|$|Before each flight, a {{briefing}} was held, alerting the crewmembers to basic world events {{as well as}} safety criteria. At least 15 hours before takeoff, the crew would thoroughly <b>pre-flight</b> their aircraft. Inadvertently, this also increased efficiency in terms of maintenance and other <b>pre-flight</b> routines.|$|E
5|$|Dedicated British Airways 'Galleries First' lounges are {{available}} at some airports. The exclusive 'Concorde Room' lounges at Heathrow Terminal 5 and New York JFK airports offer <b>pre-flight</b> dining with waiter service and more intimate space. Business lounges are used where these are not available.|$|E
5|$|After the deicing {{truck was}} repaired, the pilot {{requested}} a second deicing, though {{the flight crew}} did not perform a walkaround of their airplane, and USAir procedures did not require them to do so. Following the second deicing, LaGuardia ground control granted Flight 405 permission to taxi to Runway 13. The flight crew completed the <b>pre-flight</b> checklist during the taxi.|$|E
5|$|Graham's {{career at}} Northwestern officially ended in February 1944, {{when he moved}} to Colgate University in Hamilton, New York, in the Navy's V-5 cadet program, a pilot {{training}} course. He played basketball for Colgate before moving to North Carolina <b>Pre-Flight</b> later in 1944, where he played on the Cloudbusters football team under coaches Glenn Killinger and Bear Bryant.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} the first Orange Bowl to feature tie-ins between the Big Seven Conference and the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) champions. It {{was the first}}-ever meeting of the two teams. Maryland and Oklahoma were head coached by former colleagues Jim Tatum and Bud Wilkinson, respectively, who had {{previously}} coached together at the United States Navy's Iowa <b>Pre-Flight</b> School and the University of Oklahoma.|$|E
5|$|After the United States {{entry into}} World War II, Loring {{enlisted in the}} U.S. Army at Portland, at age 23.in March 1942, and as a private joined the Army Air Corps. By May 1942, he had been {{selected}} as an aviation cadet at the USAAC <b>pre-flight</b> school at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama. There, Loring completed primary, basic and advanced flight training courses. After graduating, Loring was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army Reserve with a pilot rating.|$|E
5|$|As {{the project}} name suggests, the mobile robot is a cobot – a {{collaborative}} robot. During phases of navigation and inspection, a human operator accompanies the robot; {{he can take}} control if necessary, add inspection tasks, note a defect {{that is not in}} the list of robot checks, or validate the results. In the case of <b>pre-flight</b> inspections, the diagnosis of the walk-around is sent to the pilot who decides whether or not to take off.|$|E
5|$|Pellerin was {{originally}} scheduled {{to fly in}} this mission, {{as he had done}} on the 17 June flight. Pellerin was unavailable for the flight on 24 June and Wolff was selected as the replacement aircrew member. Due to the short notice of his assignment to the mission, Wolff did not participate in the <b>pre-flight</b> briefing and boarded the aircraft after the engines were started. Thus, Wolff was not aware of the planned mission profile and did not have an opportunity to raise any objections before take-off.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{the private}} sector, {{military}} weather forecasters present weather conditions to the war fighter community. Military weather forecasters provide <b>pre-flight</b> and in-flight weather briefs to pilots and provide real time resource protection services for military installations. Naval forecasters cover the waters and ship weather forecasts. The United States Navy provides a special service to both themselves {{and the rest of}} the federal government by issuing forecasts for tropical cyclones across the Pacific and Indian Oceans through their Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E
5|$|When the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II, Glenn quit college to {{enlist in the}} U.S. Army Air Corps. Never called to duty, he enlisted as a U.S. Navy {{aviation}} cadet in March 1942. Glenn attended the University of Iowa in Iowa City for <b>pre-flight</b> training and continued at Naval Air Station Olathe in Kansas for primary training, where {{he made his first}} solo flight in a military aircraft. During advanced training at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas, he accepted an offer to transfer to the U.S. Marine Corps.|$|E
5|$|After Wade's resignation, Crisp {{was again}} {{retained}} {{on the football}} staff. Working under Frank Thomas, Crisp continued in his role of line coach, and again won {{a share of the}} national championship after the 1934 season. Under Thomas, Crisp's role outside of his duties as the line coach was that of the team disciplinarian to compliment the soft-spoken, diplomatic style of Thomas. He continued in his role as line coach {{through the end of the}} 1941 season when he took a leave of absence to serve as a civilian physical training instructor for the U.S. Navy <b>pre-flight</b> school at the University of Georgia. He then returned to Alabama and again served as line coach for the 1945 season, before he left to take an assistant coaching position with the Miami Seahawks.|$|E
5|$|After the fire, the Monterey was {{declared}} unfit for service, and the crippled carrier reached Ulithi on December 21 before continuing across the Pacific to Bremerton, Washington where it underwent repairs. On December 24, 1944, at Ulithi, Ford was {{detached from the}} ship {{and sent to the}} Navy <b>Pre-Flight</b> School at Saint Mary's College of California, where he was assigned to the Athletic Department until April 1945. One of his duties was to coach football. From the end of April 1945 to January 1946, he was {{on the staff of the}} Naval Reserve Training Command, Naval Air Station, Glenview, Illinois, as the Staff Physical and Military Training Officer. On October 3, 1945, he was promoted to lieutenant commander.|$|E
5|$|James {{attended}} Ohio State University {{starting in}} 1941, {{the same year}} Brown was hired as the school's head football coach. He played on the freshman team in his first year, moving to the varsity team in 1942. Ohio State finished {{the season with a}} 9–1 win–loss record and won its first-ever college football national championship. James, who played as a halfback, was injured in a late-season game against the University of Illinois. This caused him to miss Ohio State's annual game against arch-rival Michigan, but he returned for the final game of the season against Iowa <b>Pre-Flight,</b> a military squad. James ran for a 54-yard touchdown on that game's first play and later added a punt return for a touchdown as Ohio State won 41–12.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma {{was led by}} seventh-year {{head coach}} Bud Wilkinson. He had assumed the {{position}} himself after Tatum resigned to leave for Maryland. The two had also both served as assistant coaches in the U.S. Navy for the Iowa <b>Pre-Flight</b> football team under Don Faurot. Faurot had pioneered the split-T offense that both Tatum and Wilkinsons' teams employed. Since taking over at Oklahoma, Wilkinson had achieved a 62–8–3record. Oklahoma entered the game on an eight-game winning streak with a single loss in the season-opener to Notre Dame and a tie in Week 2 against Pittsburgh. Oklahoma also had an injured quarterback, second-stringer Pat O'Neal had separated his sternum at Miami and would miss the game.|$|E
5|$|Polyakov {{underwent}} medical assessments before, during, {{and after}} the flight. He also underwent two follow-up examinations six months after returning to Earth. When researchers compared {{the results of these}} medical exams, it was revealed that although there were no impairments of cognitive functions, Polyakov experienced a clear decline in mood as well as a feeling of increased workload during the first few weeks of spaceflight and return to Earth. However, Polyakov's mood stabilized to <b>pre-flight</b> levels between the second and fourteenth month of his mission. It was also revealed that Polyakov did not suffer from any prolonged performance impairments after returning to Earth. In light of these findings, researchers concluded that a stable mood and overall function could be maintained during extended duration spaceflights, such as manned missions to Mars.|$|E
5|$|Having {{completed}} his <b>pre-flight</b> training in March 1943, Glenn was commissioned {{as a second}} lieutenant. After advanced training at Camp Kearny, California, {{he was assigned to}} Marine Squadron VMJ-353 and flew R4D transport planes. Glenn was posted to the Marine Corps Air Station El Centro in California in July 1943 and joined VMO-155, which flew the F4F Wildcat fighter. The Wildcat was obsolete by this time, and VMO-155 re-equipped with the F4U Corsair in September 1943. He was promoted to first lieutenant in October 1943, and shipped out to Hawaii in January 1944. It was intended that VMO-155 would move to the Marshall Islands but this was delayed, and on February 21 it moved to Midway Atoll and became part of the garrison. This had been the site of the Battle of Midway in 1942, but was a backwater by this time. VMO-155 moved to the Marshall Islands in June 1944, and flew 57 combat missions in the area. He received two Distinguished Flying Crosses and ten Air Medals.|$|E
5|$|On March 21, 1942, Davis {{enlisted in}} the United States Army in Lubbock, Texas, just after the US entry into World War II. On June 3, he was {{appointed}} an aviation cadet in the Army Air Corps. He was moved to Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas for <b>pre-flight</b> training, which he completed in August. He was then moved to Jones Field in Bonham, Texas for primary flight training. During this training, {{he got his first}} 60 hours of flight time aboard a Fairchild PT-19 trainer aircraft. Then, he flew for another 74 hours during Basic Flight Training in Waco, Texas and a final stint of training aboard the T-6 Texan at Aloe Field in Victoria, Texas. On February 16, 1943, Davis completed his training and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the US Army Reserve, and immediately ordered to active duty with the Army Air Forces. By this time he had accrued 314 hours of flight time.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1942 he {{established}} and refined the administrative infrastructure for aviation training. Radford oversaw the massive {{growth of the}} training division, establishing separate sections for administration; Physical Training Service Schools; and training devices; and sections to train various aviators in flight, aircraft operation, radio operation, and gunnery. The section also organized technical training and wrote training literature. He also engineered the establishment of four field commands for pilot training. Air Primary Training Command commanded all <b>pre-flight</b> schools and Naval reserve aviation bases in the country. Air Intermediate Training Command administered Naval Air Station Pensacola and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi where flight training was conducted. Air Operational Training Command {{was in charge of}} all education of pilots between pilot training and their first flying assignments. Finally, Air Technical Training Command trained enlisted men for support jobs in aviation such as maintenance, engineering, aerography, and parachute operations. Radford sought to integrate his own efficient leadership style into the organization of these schools.|$|E
25|$|On March 10, 2017, it was {{announced}} on Toonami <b>Pre-Flight</b> that One Piece would {{be removed from the}} block after March 18.|$|E
25|$|In February 2017, Philippine Airlines {{released}} a new <b>pre-flight</b> safety demonstration video {{in conjunction with}} The Heart of the Filipino campaign. The video featured various tourist destinations in the Philippines with locals from those destinations demonstrating the safety guidelines.|$|E
25|$|Williams {{completed}} <b>pre-flight</b> {{training in}} Athens, Georgia, his primary training at NAS Bunker Hill, Indiana, and his advanced flight training at NAS Pensacola. He received his gold Naval Aviator wings and his commission {{as a second}} lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps on May 2, 1944.|$|E
25|$|Michigan's {{starting}} lineup against Iowa <b>Pre-Flight</b> was Bruce Hilkene (left end), Arthur Leroux (left tackle), Quentin Sickels (left guard), Harold Watts (center), George Burg (right guard), Clem Bauman (right tackle), Art Renner (right end), Ponsetto (quarterback), Gene Derricotte (left halfback), Bob Nussbaumer (right halfback), and Wiese (fullback).|$|E
25|$|Athletic {{director}} Jap Haskell recommended Jim Tatum to University of Oklahoma president George Cross, {{and other}} applicants {{considered by the}} Board of Regents included Bear Bryant and Harold Drew. Haskell {{had served in the}} U.S. Navy during the war, and Tatum was an assistant coach for the Navy's Iowa <b>Pre-Flight</b> School football team under head coach Don Faurot, the inventor of the split-T formation. Prior to that, Tatum had coached at his own alma mater, North Carolina. Bud Wilkinson, who had been a colleague of Tatum's at Iowa <b>Pre-Flight,</b> was hired as Oklahoma's new backfield coach. Walter Driskill, the former line coach at Colorado and Wyoming, was given that same role at Oklahoma. Tatum and Wilkinson installed the split-T, the innovative new offensive system they had learned under Don Faurot during the war.|$|E
25|$|It {{was one of}} two {{aircraft}} {{carrying the}} Wichita State University football team to Logan, Utah, for a game against Utah State University; the second aircraft flew a conventional route and arrived safely in Utah. Pilot errors, including poor in-flight decisions and inadequate <b>pre-flight</b> planning, were officially reported as leading to the crash.|$|E
25|$|The Del Monte Hotel (now the {{location}} of the Naval Postgraduate School) was leased in February 1943 for conducting a large <b>Pre-Flight</b> Training School. A year later, this was changed to an ETP Primary School, which continued in operation until June 1947, serving about 6,000 students, the most of any of the Primary Schools.|$|E
25|$|Fixed laser {{installations}} (e.g. laser guide {{stars from}} observatories) may be marked on aeronautical charts so pilots {{are aware of}} potential beams along their flight path. Temporary uses (laser shows) may be described in <b>pre-flight</b> information. For example, in the U.S., laser uses submitted to the FAA are often listed in NOTAMs for pilots.|$|E
25|$|Powers {{enjoyed the}} limelight, and {{was accused of}} {{scheduling}} news conferences so he could appear live on national television and occasionally twisting the facts. For example, he told reporters the day before Gus Grissom's flight that the astronaut had gone fishing that day and had cooked and eaten his catch, which would have violated his <b>pre-flight</b> diet.|$|E
25|$|Nine {{minutes after}} takeoff, the {{aircraft}} ditched in rough seas 11.3 miles NW of San Juan Airport, broke apart and sank after three minutes. Panicking passengers {{refused to leave}} the sinking wreck. 52 passengers were killed, and 17 passengers and crew members were rescued by the USCG. After this accident it was recommended to implement <b>pre-flight</b> safety demonstrations for over-water flights.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1941, Johnson enlisted as an {{aviation}} cadet in the United States Army, and entered the service at Oklahoma City on November 11, 1941, {{as a member of}} Class 42F. <b>Pre-Flight</b> training was conducted at Kelly Field, Texas, beginning November 12 and was still in progress when the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor thrust the United States into World War II.|$|E
25|$|However, {{due to the}} Guam and CNMI {{visa waiver}} program for certain countries, an {{eligibility}} pre-clearance check is carried on Guam for flights to the States. For travel from the Northern Mariana Islands to Guam, a <b>pre-flight</b> passport and visa check is performed before boarding the flight to Guam. On flights from Guam to the Northern Mariana Islands, no immigration check is performed. Traveling between Guam and the States through a foreign point, however, does require a passport.|$|E
25|$|Unlike some {{cars and}} motorcycles, a Wankel aero-engine will be {{sufficiently}} warm before full power is asked {{of it because}} of the time taken for <b>pre-flight</b> checks. A Wankel aero-engine spends most of its operational time at high power outputs, with little idling. This makes ideal the use of peripheral ports. An advantage is that modular engines with more than two rotors are feasible. If icing of any intake tracts is an issue, there is plenty of waste engine heat available to prevent icing.|$|E
25|$|Aanenson {{enlisted in}} the United States Army Air Corps in 1942 but was not called up to active duty until February 1943. He left for Santa Ana Air Force Base for <b>pre-flight</b> {{training}} and then to Primary Flight School at Thunderbird Field near Phoenix, Arizona. In September 1943, he attended Basic Flight School at Gardner Field near Bakersfield, California. Aanenson then received Advanced Flight Training at Luke Field, Phoenix, Arizona where he was commissioned a second lieutenant on January 7, 1944. From January to May 1944, he trained at Harding Field in Baton Rouge, Louisiana where he met his wife Jackie.|$|E
25|$|After serving {{for several}} years in staff assignments, Feightner {{received}} orders to attend the U.S. Navy Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River in Maryland. He graduated in July 1949 with the school's second class and served with the Flight Test Division at the Naval Air Test Center where he flew a variety of aircraft including helicopters and the Navy's largest transport, the Lockheed R6V Constitution. Feightner also tested the Grumman F8F Bearcat, the Vought F4U Corsair, and the Grumman F7F Tigercat. When Colonel Charles Lindbergh came to evaluate the Tigercat, Feightner, as F7F project pilot, provided the <b>pre-flight</b> instruction.|$|E
25|$|Greenlee and David team up {{to regain}} control of Fusion. Greenlee plants {{documents}} that frame Erica for stealing money from the Miranda House to pay for her new line of Fusion products. When this scandal becomes public, Erica is out of state, and in order to delay Erica from returning quickly and make a counter-statement to the scandal, David has someone sabotage the plane – expecting the pilot to run routine inspection before take-off. Erica, {{in a hurry to get}} back to Pine Valley, insists the pilot take off without the <b>pre-flight</b> inspection or filing a flight plan.|$|E
25|$|The earth {{inductor}} compass failed {{soon after}} takeoff and after {{an attempt to}} fix it, Hegenberger disregarded the instrument. At 7:45a.m. {{he picked up the}} Crissy beacon as planned, but within an hour the receiver failed. Hegenberger seemingly repaired the radio by switching out the batteries, but the signal was lost again after another thirty minutes, forcing Hegenberger to navigate by dead reckoning using the magnetic compass and driftmeter. As part of his <b>pre-flight</b> planning, Hegenberger had computed azimuth and altitude for the sun, as well as selecting stars for sighting, for various points along the route. He used these figures for celestial observations to supplement his dead reckoning.|$|E
25|$|After {{its flight}} test program, the two RB-57F prototypes {{were sent to}} Rhein-Main AB, West Germany in late 1963 for {{operational}} testing and evaluation (OT) with the 7407th Support Squadron, where they proved their effectiveness in flights along the German border at over , taking long-range photographs over the border into East Germany. They also flew reconnaissance missions over the Baltic Sea. They returned to the United States in February 1964 and {{were assigned to the}} 58th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. High altitude flights required the wearing of David Clark Company A/P22S-2 and later A/P22S-4 full pressure suits, and crew <b>pre-flight</b> preparations were similar to those used by U-2 and SR-71 crews.|$|E
