Eight critical stress points were selected for the pylon fatigue analysis. Using fracture mechanics and the half-cycle theory (directly or indirectly) for the calculations of fatigue-crack growth,the remaining fatigue life (number of flights left) was estimated for each critical part. It was found that the two rear hooks had relatively short fatigue life and that the front hook had the shortest fatigue life of all the parts analyzed. The rest of the pylon parts were found to be noncritical because of their extremely long fatigue life associated with the low operational stress levels...|$|R

40|$|A new {{numerical}} methodology {{to examine}} fluid-structure interaction of a wing/pylon/store {{system has been}} developed. The aeroelastic equation of motion of the complete system is solved iteratively in the time domain using a two-entity numerical code comprised of ABAQUS/Standard and the Unsteady-Vortex-Lattice Method. Both codes communicate through an iterative handshake procedure during which displacements and air loads are updated. For each increment in time the force/displacement equilibrium is found in this manner. The wing, <b>pylon,</b> and <b>store</b> data considered in this analysis are based on an F 16 configuration that was identified to induce flutter in flight at subsonic speeds. The wing structure is modeled as an elastic plate and <b>pylon</b> and <b>store</b> are rigid bodies. The store body {{is connected to the}} pylon through an elastic joint exercising pitch and yaw degrees of freedom. Vortex-Lattice theory featuring closed ring-vortices and continuous vortex shedding to form the wakes is employed to model the aerodynamics of wing, <b>store,</b> and <b>pylon.</b> The methodology was validated against published data demonstrating excellent agreement with documented key phenomena of fluid-structure iteration.

50|$|NATO {{suspension}} equipment (pylons {{and other means}} of carriage) and stores are standardized in MIL-STD-8591.

50|$|Other {{upgrades}} {{are also}} being considered, such as a fast-track effort to add <b>stores</b> <b>pylons</b> for external payloads, including improved electro-optic / infrared and multispectral sensors; or jamming pods. While a Global Hawk configuration carrying two 225 kilogram (500 pound) or four 112 kilogram (250 pound) GPS-guided bombs has been considered, senior Air Force brass are not enthusiastic about arming the type, since {{that would make it}} politically more difficult to use in peacekeeping operations or to obtain overflight permission from friendly nations.|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} method for prediction of external store carriage loads at transonic speeds is described. The geometric flexibility required {{for treatment of}} isolated and underwing, <b>pylon</b> mounted <b>stores</b> is achieved by computing solutions on a five level embedded grid arrangement. A completely automated grid generation procedure facilitates applications. Store modeling capability consists of bodies of revolution with multiple fore and aft fins. A body conforming grid improves {{the accuracy of the}} computed store body flow field. A nonlinear finite difference relaxation scheme, developed specifically for modified transonic small disturbance flow equations, enhances numerical stability and accuracy. As a result, more accurate treatment of low aspect ratio, highly swept and tapered wing planforms is possible. A limited supersonic freestream capability is also provided. Pressure, load distribution, force and moment correlation show good agreement for several test cases...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} for a passive flutter suppression approach {{known as the}} decoupler pylon. The decoupler pylon dynamically isolates the wing from store pitch inertia effects by means of soft spring/damper elements assisted by a low frequency feedback control system which minimizes static pitch deflections of the store because of maneuvers and changing flight conditions. Wind tunnel tests and analyses show that this relatively simple pylon suspension system provides substantial increases in flutter speed and reduces the sensitivity of flutter to changes in store inertia and center of gravity. Flutter characteristics of F- 16 and YF- 17 flutter models equipped with decoupler <b>pylon</b> mounted <b>stores</b> {{are presented}} and compared with results obtained on the same model configuration with active flutter suppression systems. These studies show both passive and active concepts {{to be effective in}} suppressing wing/store flutter. Also presented are data showing the influence of pylon stiffness nonlinearities on wing/store flutter...|$|R
50|$|Wing {{stations}} require pylons {{to carry}} objects. Stations on the fuselage {{may not necessarily}} require a pylon, such as the fuselage stations on the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, while other aircraft need pylons for certain stations {{in order to provide}} clearance for the landing gear retraction sequence (like in F-14 Tomcat) or to provide necessary item space (like in Mikoyan MiG-27). Swing-wing aircraft that mount pylons on the moving portion of the wing (such as the General Dynamics F-111 and the Panavia Tornado) must include a mechanism for swiveling the pylon as the wing sweeps fore or aft, {{in order to keep the}} <b>pylon</b> and <b>store</b> facing directly forwards at all times. The F-111's outermost pair of hardpoints do not swivel, and can only be used while the wing is fully extended. This restricts the aircraft to subsonic flight only while these pylons are fitted, usually fitted with fuel tanks during ferry flights. The pylons are automatically jettisoned if the wing sweep moves past 26 degrees, which would mean that the aircraft is accelerating towards transonic speeds.|$|R
40|$|A {{transonic}} unsteady aerodynamic and aeroelasticity code {{has been}} developed for application to realistic aircraft configurations. The new code is called CAP-TSD which is an acronym for Computational Aeroelasticity Program - Transonic Small Disturbance. The CAP-TSD code uses a time-accurate approximate factorization (AF) algorithm for solution of the unsteady transonic small-disturbance equation. The AF algorithm is very efficient for solution of steady and unsteady transonic flow problems. It can provide accurate solutions in only several hundred time steps yielding a significant computational cost savings when compared to alternative methods. The new code can treat complete aircraft geometries with multiple lifting surfaces and bodies including canard, wing, tail, control surfaces, launchers, <b>pylons,</b> fuselage, <b>stores,</b> and nacelles. Applications are presented {{for a series of}} five configurations of increasing complexity to demonstrate the wide range of geometrical applicability of CAP-TSD. These results are in good agreement with available experimental steady and unsteady pressure data. Calculations for the General Dynamics one-ninth scale F- 16 C aircraft model are presented to demonstrate application to a realistic configuration. Unsteady results for the entire F- 16 C aircraft undergoing a rigid pitching motion illustrated the capability required to perform transonic unsteady aerodynamic and aeroelastic analyses for such configurations...|$|R

The Mirage IIIC was armed with twin 30 mm DEFA cannon fitted in the belly with the gun ports under the air intakes.

40|$|The {{manner of}} {{representing}} a flight vehicle structure as an assembly of beam, spring, and rigid-body components for vibration analysis is described.

The particular manner of employing beam, spring, and rigid-body components to model such items as wing structures, external <b>stores,</b> <b>pylons</b> supporting engines or external stores, and sprung masses associated with launch vehicle fuel slosh is described by means of several simple qualitative examples. A detailed numerical example consisting of a tilt-rotor VTOL aircraft is included to provide a unified illustration of the procedure for representing a structure as an equivalent system of beams, springs, and rigid bodies, the manner of forming the substructure mass and stiffness matrices, and the mechanics of writing the equations of constraint which enforce deflection compatibility at the junctions of the substructures.

2500|$|The USAF BIG SAFARI program office {{managed the}} Predator program {{and was given}} {{direction}} on 21 June 2000 to explore options to arm the aircraft. [...] This led to it being fitted with reinforced wings and <b>stores</b> <b>pylons</b> to carry munitions, {{as well as a}} laser designator. The RQ-1 conducted its first firing of a Hellfire anti-tank missile on 16 February 2001; over a bombing range near Indian Springs Air Force Station north of Las Vegas, Nevada, an inert AGM-114C successfully hit a tank target. This led to a series of tests on 21 February 2001 in which the Predator fired three Hellfire missiles, scoring hits on a stationary tank with all three missiles. Following the February tests, {{the decision was made to}} move immediately to increment two of the testing phase, which involved more complex tests to hunt for simulated moving targets from greater altitudes with the more advanced AGM-114K version. The scheme was put into service, with the armed Predators given the new designation of MQ-1A. The Predator gives little warning of attack; it is relatively quiet and the Hellfire is supersonic, so it strikes before it is heard by the target.|$|R
5000|$|Similar {{requirements}} in the Soviet Union also led TsAGI, the Soviet aerodynamics bureau, {{to explore the}} possibilities of variable geometry. TsAGI evolved two distinct designs, differing mainly in the distance (expressed {{as a percentage of}} total wingspan) between the wing pivots. A wider spacing not only reduced the negative aerodynamic effects of changing wing sweep, but also provided a larger fixed wing section which could be used for landing gear or <b>stores</b> <b>pylons.</b> This could, in fact, be adapted to more-or-less existing airframes, which the Soviets soon did, with the Sukhoi Su-17 (based on the earlier swept wing Sukhoi Su-7). The limitation of the wide spacing, however, was that it reduced the benefits of variable geometry as much as it reduced their technical difficulties. For the new, [...] "clean-sheet" [...] Soviet designs, TsAGI devised a more narrowly spaced arrangement {{similar to that of the}} F-111. This design was used (albeit at different scales) for the MiG-23 fighter and the Sukhoi Su-24 interdictor, which flew in prototype forms at the end of the 1960s, entering service in the early 1970s. [...] more than 100 Tupolev Tu-22M strategic bombers are in use.|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} {{nonlinear}} aerodynamic effects for transonic Limit Cycle Oscillation (LCO) mechanisms are explored via CFD analyses, providing a significant building {{block in the}} understanding of the overall aeroelastic effects in the LCO mechanism. Examination of a true Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) LCO case is considered quasi-incrementally since this capability does not yet exist in the flutter community. The first step in this process is to examine the flow field on the F- 16 wing during prescribed rigid-body pitch and roll oscillations, simulating the torsional and bending nature of LCO mechanisms. Next, the wingtip will be forcefully deformed in bending, torsion, and complex LCO motions and <b>pylons,</b> launchers, and <b>stores</b> will be added. Through this build-up Fluid Structure Reaction (FSR) approach, it is hoped that valuable insight is gained into the characteristics of the flow field during transonic LCO conditions in order to assess any possible influences on the LCO mechanism. It is hypothesized that flow features interact with the structure in a way that limits the magnitude of an LCO mechanism, effectively bounding the divergent flutter. F- 16 rigid-body pitch and roll oscillations are presented for tip-launcher and clean-wing cases, simulating the torsional and bending nature of LCO mechanisms, respectively. The F- 1...|$|R
5000|$|The {{work was}} carried out by Atlas Aviation (formerly Atlas Aircraft Corporation and lately Denel Aviation), using {{expertise}} partly gained by recruiting technicians from Israel's aborted IAI Lavi fighter project. The upgrade consisted of a complete refurbishment of the airframe down to zero hours (in which some 50% of the original airframe was said by Atlas to have been replaced), the fitting of non-moving canards (Cheetah D & E having slightly smaller (70%) canards than that of the Cheetah C and Kfir) just aft of the engine intakes, two new <b>stores</b> <b>pylons</b> at the wing roots, an aerial refuelling probe, new ejection seats, a more powerful engine (the SNECMA Atar 9K50C-11 in South Africa) in the D and C variants, a new main wing spar along with a new [...] "drooping" [...] leading edge and a dog-tooth incision on each wing, modern elevons controlled by a twin computer flight control system, and strakes on the nose to improve the Cheetah's high-Angle of attack (AoA) performance. The aerodynamic refinements alone increased the turn rate by 15%, increased the AoA, reduced the minimum airspeed to 100 kt and increased maximum take-off weight by 700 kg. However, it also resulted in a 5% decrease in maximum level speed and acceleration.|$|R
50|$|However, a ministerial {{ruling on}} 9 July 1962 decreed that all future {{tactical}} nuclear weapons {{should be limited to}} a yield of 10 kt. The RAF issued {{a new version of the}} OR.1177 specification, accepting the lower yield, while making provision in the design for it to be capable of adaptation later for a higher yield, in the event of the political restriction being lifted. Meanwhile, the RAF explored ways of compensating for the lower yield by including, in the specifications for both the bomb and TSR-2, provision for releasing the smaller weapons in salvos, dropping sticks of four of the revised OR.1177, later named WE.177A, at 1000 yd intervals to prevent the detonation of the first weapon destroying the succeeding ones before they could, in turn, detonate. This led to the requirement that the TSR-2 must be able to carry four WE.177As, two internally and two on external underwing <b>stores</b> <b>pylons</b> - the width of the TSR-2 bomb bay (originally designed to accommodate a single Red Beard weapon) necessitating the reduction in diameter of the WE.177A to 16.5 in, the bomb's width and fin span being constrained by the need to fit two WE.177 bombs side-by-side in the aircraft's bomb bay. The requirement for stick bombing using nuclear weapons was soon dropped as larger yield bombs came back into favour.|$|R
