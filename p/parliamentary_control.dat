The first English Army regiments, including elements of the disbanded New Model Army, were formed between November 1660 and January 1661 and became a standing military force for Britain (financed by Parliament). The Royal Scots and Irish Armies were financed by the parliaments of Scotland and Ireland. <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>control</b> was established by the Bill of Rights 1689 and Claim of Right Act 1689, although the monarch continued to influence aspects of army administration until at least {{the end of the}} nineteenth century.|$|E

The Isles of Scilly had supported Charles I during the conflict between 1642 and 1646, and, after a short period in <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>control,</b> the islands rebelled in favour of Charles in 1648. The islands became a base for Royalist privateers, and Parliament became concerned that the Dutch, then hostile to England, might counter the piracy by occupying the islands, gaining a foothold that they could then use against England. In 1651 Parliament sent Sir Robert Blake in charge of a naval task force to retake the islands.|$|E

The Royalists on Tresco appeared to have believed that King Charles's Castle was a critical defensive point {{on the island and}} probably built new earthwork defences around the castle to defend it against an attack from the land. It is possible, however, that these defences instead date from around 1627, and were built by the King's engineer, Bernard Johnson. During this period the castle was given its current name.|$|E

25|$|John Lesley {{wrote on}} behalf of Mary, Queen of Scots. A defence of the honour of the right high, mightye and noble Princess Marie (1569) had its London {{printing}} prevented by Lord Burghley. It raised, in particular, the tensions between the Succession Act of 1543 and the actual wills left by Henry VIII. Elizabeth would not accept the implied degree of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>control</b> of the succession. Further discussion of the succession was prohibited by statute, from 1571. A related work, by Thomas Morgan (as supposed), or Morgan Philipps (supposed), for Mary, Queen of Scots, was another printing of Lesley's work, in 1571. Lesley's arguments in fact went back to Edmund Plowden, and had been simplified by Anthony Browne.|$|E
25|$|With the {{military}} faltering and with widespread loss {{of confidence in}} the Kaiser, Germany moved towards surrender. Prince Maximilian of Baden took charge of a new government as Chancellor of Germany to negotiate with the Allies. Negotiations with President Wilson began immediately, in the hope that he would offer better terms than the British and French. Wilson demanded a constitutional monarchy and <b>parliamentary</b> <b>control</b> over the German military. There was no resistance when the Social Democrat Philipp Scheidemann on 9 November declared Germany to be a republic. The Kaiser, kings and other hereditary rulers all were removed from power and Wilhelm fled to exile in the Netherlands. Imperial Germany was dead; a new Germany had been born as the Weimar Republic.|$|E

For example, the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 allowed Ministers to change certain Acts of Parliament by way of statutory instrument, without going through the normal parliamentary legislative process. This power was later extended by the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 and the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006, although more rigorous <b>parliamentary</b> <b>controls</b> were introduced.|$|R

He campaigned for neutrality but on the outbreak of war accepted that the fight was lost, and with Charles Trevelyan, Norman Angell and Ramsay MacDonald, formed the Union of Democratic Control to press for a more responsive foreign policy (he also resigned his candidature at this time). He was Secretary of the UDC until his death. The main demands of the UDC were: (1) that in future to prevent secret diplomacy there should be <b>parliamentary</b> <b>control</b> over foreign policy; (2) there should be negotiations after the war with other democratic European countries in an attempt to form an organisation to help prevent future conflicts; (3) {{that at the end of}} the war the terms of peace should neither humiliate the defeated nation nor artificially rearrange frontiers, as this might provide a cause for future wars.|$|E
25|$|The Europol Directorate, day-to-day {{leadership}} of the Agency, is appointed by the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council (JHA) for four-year terms. As of September 2017, the Agency was headed by Executive Director Rob Wainwright and Deputy Directors Wil van Gemert, Oldrich Martinu and Luis de Eusebio Ramos. The Agency is accountable to and controlled by the Justice and Home Affairs Council. Together with the European Parliament, the Council approves Europol’s budget and regulations related to its work. The Council forwards an annual special report to the European Parliament {{on the work of}} the Agency—and the Parliament also discharges Europol from its responsibility for managing a set budget. Before 2009, the Agency was an international body and thus the European Parliament lacked effective scrutiny powers over it. From 2009 to 2017, the European Parliament had been the sole organ in <b>parliamentary</b> <b>control</b> of Europol. The Joint Parliamentary Scrutiny Group (JPSG) was created at the EU Speakers Conference in Bratislava on 23-25 April 2017 to allow both the European Parliament and national EU parliaments to exert control over Europol.|$|E
25|$|By July {{the tide}} was turning in the Parliamentarians' favour: bombardment, scurvy, lack of water, perhaps a {{shortage}} of gunpowder {{and the threat of}} starvation and only 25 men fit to fight meant that the castle surrendered on 25 July 1645. Only about half of the original 500 defenders emerged alive. Subsequently the castle was repaired and rearmed for Parliament with a company of 160. Matthew Boynton, the castle's new governor, declared for the king on 27 July 1648 when the soldiers went unpaid. This led to a second siege which brought the castle back under <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>control</b> on 19 December, when the garrison was defeated as much by the oncoming winter as by the Parliamentary forces. The castle changed hands seven times between 1642 and 1648. The castle was later used as a prison for those who were deemed to be enemies of the Commonwealth of England, the country's brief period of republicanism; the shell of the keep survives, minus the west wall, which was destroyed in the bombardment. The castle was returned to the Crown following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660.|$|E

25|$|Parnell now {{sought to}} use his {{experience}} and huge support to advance his pursuit of Home Rule and resurrected the suppressed Land League on 17 October 1882 as the Irish National League (INL). It combined moderate agrarianism, a Home Rule programme with electoral functions, was hierarchical and autocratic in structure with Parnell wielding immense authority and direct <b>parliamentary</b> <b>control.</b> Parliamentary constitutionalism was the future path. The informal alliance between the new, tightly disciplined INL and the Catholic Church {{was one of the}} main factors for the revitalisation of the national Home Rule cause after 1882. Parnell saw that the explicit endorsement of Catholicism was of vital importance to the success of this venture and worked in close co-operation with the Catholic hierarchy in consolidating its hold over the Irish electorate. The leaders of the Catholic Church largely recognised the Parnellite party as guardians of church interests, despite uneasiness with a powerful lay leadership. At the end of 1885, the highly centralised organisation had 1,200 branches spread around the country, though there were fewer in Ulster than in the other provinces. Parnell left the day-to-day running of the INL in the hands of his lieutenants Timothy Harrington as Secretary, William O'Brien, editor of its newspaper United Ireland, and Timothy Healy. Its continued agrarian agitation led to the passing of several Irish Land Acts that over three decades changed the face of Irish land ownership, replacing large Anglo-Irish estates with tenant ownership.|$|E
500|$|The {{five years}} Henson spent as Dean of Durham {{were marked by}} further controversy, {{including}} his objection to the existing divorce laws as too favourable to men and unfair to women. He was hostile to changes aimed at giving the Church more control over its own affairs; he regarded establishment and <b>parliamentary</b> <b>control</b> as safeguards against extremism. He opposed William Temple's [...] "Life and Liberty movement", which campaigned for synodical and democratic government of the Church, and he was against {{the establishment of the}} National Assembly of the Church of England in 1919. To Henson, the essence of Anglicanism rested on parliamentary enforcement of the rights of the laity of the Church against the bishops and priests, and the inclusion of both clergy and laity in all matters under the rule of the monarch as Supreme Governor of the Church.|$|E
500|$|Although his {{accession}} was {{at first}} welcomed by politicians of all parties, {{the first years of}} his reign were marked by political instability, largely generated as a result of disagreements over the Seven Years' War. George was also perceived as favouring Tory ministers, which led to his denunciation by the Whigs as an autocrat. On his accession, the Crown lands produced relatively little income; most revenue was generated through taxes and excise duties. George surrendered the Crown Estate to <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>control</b> in return for a civil list annuity for the support of his household and the expenses of civil government. Claims that he used the income to reward supporters with bribes and gifts are disputed by historians who say such claims [...] "rest on nothing but falsehoods put out by disgruntled opposition". Debts amounting to over £3million over the course of George's reign were paid by Parliament, and the civil list annuity was increased from time to time. He aided the Royal Academy of Arts with large grants from his private funds, and may have donated more than half of his personal income to charity. Of his art collection, the two most notable purchases are Johannes Vermeer's Lady at the Virginals and a set of Canalettos, but it is as a collector of books that he is best remembered. The King's Library was open and available to scholars and was the foundation of a new national library.|$|E

2500|$|He {{was born}} in Stoke upon Tern in Shropshire. [...] He entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1628. In 1637, he was ordained, a deacon and priest at the same time.

In 1644, he became Provost of King's College due to <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>control</b> of the universities; however, {{he was the only}} new head of house who did not {{subscribe}} to the National Covenant.

40|$|The European Ombudsman is a {{new kind}} of 'agent', whose status and role remain unclear. On the one hand, it is {{formally}} a parliamentary body, designed to strengthen the control of EU institutions and administrations by MEPs; on the other hand, the profile and role of this organ is close to that of a court. This article argues that the hybrid nature of this organ is the reason for its success. The powers of the Ombudsman, limited as they are, give him the opportunity to combine the instruments of parliamentary scrutiny and judicial control in an original way. As such it is well equipped to scrutinize those agents which cannot be submitted to classic <b>parliamentary</b> <b>controls</b> without losing their independence, and thereby helps to reconcile executive delegation with parliamentary democracy.
