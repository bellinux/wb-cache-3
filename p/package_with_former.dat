40|$|In {{his report}} into {{corruption}} in Queensland, Fitzgerald listed whistleblower protection {{as a necessary}} part of a strong governance regime. "What is required is an accessible, independent body to which disclosures can be made, confidentially (at least in the first instance) and in any event free from fear of reprisals. " It was one of the reforms studied by the Electoral and Administrative Review Committee, the report of which resulted in the Whistleblowers Protection Act 1994 (WPA). The need for whistleblower protection was supported by all sides of Parliament. The Premier, Wayne Goss, in his Second Reading Speech on the Public Sector Ethics Bill, said that that Act and the WPA would form a <b>package</b> <b>with</b> the <b>former</b> outlining required behaviour and the WPA encouraging staff to report wrongdoing. The WPA was subsequently passed and has remained virtually unamended for over a decade. Such consistency is either an indication of skilled drafting and effectiveness or the fact that the Act has been neglected. It is the hypothesis of this paper that the latter is the case. This hypothesis will be tested by examining the sincerity and diligence with which the Act has been treated during, and following, its passage...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Low {{frequency}} electromagnetic casting {{is a new}} developed {{technology that}} appears in the recent years. In this paper, a comprehensive mathematical model has been developed to describe {{the interaction of the}} multiple physics fields during LFEC (low frequency electromagnetic casting) process. The model is based on a combination of the commercial finite element package ANSYS and the commercial finite volume <b>package</b> FLUENT, <b>with</b> the <b>former</b> for calculation of the electromagnetic field and the latter for calculation of the magnetic driven fluid flow, heat transfer and solidification. Moreover, the model has been verified against the temperature measurements obtained from one 7 XXX aluminum alloy billet of 200 mm in diameter, during the LFEC casting processes, respectively. There was a good agreement between the calculated results and the measured results. Further, the effects of electromagnetic frequency on fluid flow, temperature field and solidification during LFEC process have investigated numerically by using the mathematic model. The choosing criterion of the electromagnetic frequency during LFEC process has been used in order to obtain the best structure of the billets by analyzing the effects of fluid flow and temperature field on the solidification process in the presence of electromagnetic field...|$|R
