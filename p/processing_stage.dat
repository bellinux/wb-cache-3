40|$|Human {{reaction}} {{times during}} sensory-motor tasks vary considerably. To {{begin to understand}} how this variability arises' we examined neuronal populational response time variability at early versus late visual <b>processing</b> <b>stages.</b> The conventional view is that precise temporal information is gradually lost as information is passed through a layered network of mean-rate "units. " We tested in humans whether neuronal populations at different <b>processing</b> <b>stages</b> behave like mean-rate "units". A blind source separation algorithm was applied to MEG signals from sensory-motor integration tasks. Response time latency and variability for multiple visual sources were estimated by detecting single-trial stimulus-locked events for each source. In two subjects tested on four visual reaction time tasks' we reliably identified sources belonging to early and late visual <b>processing</b> <b>stages.</b> The standard deviation of response latency was smaller for early rather than late <b>processing</b> <b>stages.</b> This supports the hypothesis that human populational response time variability increases from early to late visual <b>processing</b> <b>stages.</b> Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|The {{curing process}} may take {{from a few}} days, with lye, to a few months with brine or salt packing. With the {{exception}} of California style and salt-cured olives, all methods of curing involve a major fermentation involving bacteria and yeast that is of equal importance to the final table olive product. Traditional cures, using the natural microflora on the fruit to induce fermentation, lead to two important outcomes: the leaching out and breakdown of oleuropein and other unpalatable phenolic compounds, and the generation of favourable metabolites from bacteria and yeast, such as organic acids, probiotics, glycerol, and esters, which affect the sensory properties of the final table olives. Mixed bacterial/yeast olive fermentations may have probiotic qualities. Lactic acid {{is the most important}} metabolite, as it lowers the pH, acting as a natural preservative against the growth of unwanted pathogenic species. The result is table olives which can be stored without refrigeration. Fermentations dominated by lactic acid bacteria are, therefore, the most suitable method of curing olives. Yeast-dominated fermentations produce a different suite of metabolites which provide poorer preservation, so they are corrected with an acid such as citric acid in the final <b>processing</b> <b>stage</b> to provide microbial stability.|$|E

A study was done to assess the effects of <b>processing</b> <b>stages</b> and pond type on crocodile skin size and quality. A total of 400 skins were assessed, of which 200 skins were from each pond.

Data analysed using a paired t-test for initial and final skin size within and across ponds showed that there was a significant (P = 0. 00) effect of pond type on both initial and final skin size. Earth ponds showed high skin size but had a low quality compared to cement ponds. Further, there was a significant effect of <b>processing</b> <b>stages</b> on final quality (P value = 0. 00). The conclusion of the study was that crocodile rearing environment and skin processing techniques influence final size and quality of skins.

In the current review, we discuss the How (i. e., mechanisms) and Where (i. e., locus of these mechanisms) of language control in language switching. As regards the mechanisms of language control, we describe several empirical markers of language switching and their relation to inhibition, as a potentially important mechanism of language control. From this overview it becomes apparent that some, but not all, markers indicate the occurrence of inhibition during language switching and, thus, language control. In a second part, we turn to the potential locus of language control and the role of different <b>processing</b> <b>stages</b> (concept level, lemma level, phonology, orthography, and outside language processing). Previous studies provide evidence for the employment of several of these <b>processing</b> <b>stages</b> during language control so that either a complex control mechanism involving different <b>processing</b> <b>stages</b> and/or multiple loci of language control have to be assumed.
