40|$|Abstract. Wireless Video Sensor Networks (WVNs) are lively {{interest}} in the research community as flexible means for monitoring isolated areas. WVN effectiveness can be augmented when coupled with a network of low-power, low-cost Pyroelectric InfraRed (<b>PIR)</b> <b>detectors</b> to form a multimodal surveillance system. Autonomy is a key issue as battery replacement is often impractical and even using energy scavenging techniques, such as solar harvester, ad-hoc power management policies are essential to extend network lifetime. In this {{paper we propose a}} cooperative policy to manage power consumption of a WVN powered by solar scavengers and supported by a network of PIR sensors that perform a coarse classification of movements. A cost function is calculated by each VSN according to its available energy and information from the PIR network. Such functions are used by a distributed energy aware policy that selects the best VSN to observe the activity. This VSN locally analyzes the image and detects whether or not it represents a person, and only this information is forwarded to users. The effectiveness of this technique is evaluated through simulation and compared to an approach presented in previous work. Results show an increase in system lifetime without any loss in people detection ratio...|$|R

Measuring occupancy can facilitate energy efficiency in non-domestic buildings, when control systems are able to adjust heating and cooling based on demand rather than fixed schedules. The variable “occupancy profile” itself is rarely considered as a control system parameter in building energy management systems (BEMS), and this is largely because reliably measuring occupancy {{in the past has}} been too difficult, expensive, or a mixture of both. Occupancy detection is possible using e. g. CO 2 sensors, passive infra-red (<b>PIR)</b> <b>detectors,</b> which can provide a basic trigger for services, but the actual occupancy count, and therefore the expected load on building services, requires a step change in instrumentation. Advanced occupancy sensors developed from a heterogeneous multisensory fusion strategy offer this, improving control system performance, e. g. turning off services out of hours, and not over-ventilating, saving energy, while not under-ventilating during occupancy, benefitting comfort and health. While this is the case, {{there is a shortage of}} any systematic methodology for developing robust and reliable occupancy monitoring systems from heterogeneous multi-sensory sources. In this paper we describe an innovative sensor fusion approach utilising symmetrical uncertainty (SU) analysis and a genetic based feature selection for building occupancy estimation...|$|R

One of the technologies aimed at the improvement of the energy efficiency of buildings contemplates the employment of <b>PIR</b> <b>detectors</b> used for the purpose of automation of building illumination systems. The proposed technology consists of the following two key elements: passive infrared PIR receivers and the Fresnel lens. Passive infrared PIR receivers detect the motion of warm spots against the permanent temperature background. Traditionally, these PIR receivers are incorporated into security systems and automatic switches. The receiver interacts with the external optical system through its Fresnel lens that divides the space into transparent and non-transparent sectors and focuses the infrared beaming on sensitive elements. Whenever a human being enters these sectors, a variable thermal signal is formed. The technology is applicable to design and production of the machinery which power consumption is minimal (for example, the power consumption of one detector is about 0. 3 W).

40|$|Abstract. Sensor {{networks}} {{hold the}} promise of truly intelligent buildings: buildings that adapt to the behavior of their occupants to improve productivity, efficiency, safety, and security. To be practical, such a network must be economical to manufacture, install and maintain. Similarly, the methodology must be efficient and must scale well to very large spaces. Finally, be be widely acceptable, it must be inherently privacysensitive. We propose to address these requirements by employing networks of passive infrared (<b>PIR)</b> motion <b>detectors.</b> <b>PIR</b> sensors are inexpensive, reliable, and require very little bandwidth. They also protect privacy since they are neither capable of directly identifying individuals nor of capturing identifiable imagery or audio. However, with an appropriate analysis methodology, we {{show that they are}} capable of providing useful contextual information. The methodology we propose supports scalability by adopting a hierarchical framework that splits computation into localized, distributed tasks. To support our methodology we provide theoretical justification for the method that grounds it in the action recognition literature. We also present quantitative results on a dataset that we have recorded from a 400 square meter wing of our laboratory. Specifically, we report quantitative results that show better than 90 % recognition performance for low-level activities such as walking, loitering, and turning. We also present experimental results for mid-level activities such as visiting and meeting. ...|$|R

More complex panels use a Bus network topology where the wire basically is a data loop {{around the perimeter of the}} facility, and has drops for the sensor devices which must include a unique device identifier integrated into the sensor device itself (e.g. id. biscuit).

Extracting all possible trajectories from the PIR sensor networks is important. Because the PIR sensor does not log location and individual information, none of the existing methods can generate all possible human motion trajectories that satisfy various spatio-temporal constraints from the sensor activation log data. In this paper, a geometric algebra (GA) -based approach is developed to generate all possible human trajectories from the PIR sensor network data. Firstly, {{the representation of the}} geographical network, sensor activation response sequences and the human motion are represented as algebraic elements using GA. The human motion status of each sensor activation are labeled using the GA-based trajectory tracking. Then, a matrix multiplication approach is developed to dynamically generate the human trajectories according to the sensor activation log and the spatio-temporal constraints. The method is tested with the MERL motion database. Experiments show that our method can flexibly extract the major statistical pattern of the human motion.
