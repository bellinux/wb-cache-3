5|$|Innocent was {{succeeded by}} Alexander IV, who was facing {{increasing}} military {{pressure from the}} Empire. He {{could no longer afford}} to pay Henry's expenses, instead demanding that Henry compensate the Papacy for the £90,000 spent on the war so far. This was a huge sum, and Henry turned to parliament for help in 1255, only to be rebuffed; further attempts followed, but by 1257 only partial parliamentary assistance had been offered. Alexander grew increasingly unhappy about Henry's <b>prevarication</b> and in 1258 sent an envoy to England, threatening to excommunicate Henry if he did not first pay his debts to the Papacy and then send the promised army to Sicily. Parliament again refused to assist the King in raising this money. Instead Henry turned to extorting money from the senior clergy, who were forced to sign blank charters, promising to pay effectively unlimited sums of money in support of the King's efforts, raising around £40,000. The English Church felt the money was wasted, vanishing into the long-running war in Italy.|$|E

Until that time it had been routed to Wemyss Castle and carried by the NBR. A new eastward spur from the Wellsgreen branch was provided, shortening the transit to Methil considerably. However the NBR reminded Wemyss of the earlier agreement that Wellsgreen traffic would travel via Wemyss Castle, and after some <b>prevarication</b> Wemyss was obliged to concede that obligation in August 1903.|$|E

25|$|With relegation in 1951, average gates took a heavy knock and {{the decline}} {{continued}} over the decade as success eluded the club, which finally dropped to the fourth tier of English football {{for the first time}} in 1961. However, modest ground improvements still advanced after fundraising efforts by fans which allowed the Kop to be roofed in the same year. Despite acquiring second-hand lights in 1963, boardroom <b>prevarication</b> meant that Saltergate was the final league ground in England to install floodlights, with Chesterfield's first home game under lights not being played until the 1967-1968 season.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{remaining}} {{neutral in}} the conflict, however, Habibullah {{did in fact}} accept a Turkish-German mission in Kabul and military assistance from the Central Powers as he attempted to play {{both sides of the}} conflict for the best deal. Through continual <b>prevarication</b> he resisted numerous requests for assistance, however he failed to keep in check troublesome tribal leaders, intent on undermining British rule in India, as Turkish agents attempted to foment trouble along the frontier. The departure of {{a large part of the}} British Indian Army to fight overseas and news of British defeats at the hands of the Turks aided Turkish agents in efforts at sedition, and in 1915 there was unrest amongst the Mohmands and then the Mahsuds. Notwithstanding these outbreaks, the frontier generally remained settled at a time when Britain could ill afford trouble.|$|E
25|$|According to the UNDP, {{the most}} common types of {{violence}} faced by {{women and men in}} 2012 were physical attacks (50% of reported crime cases) followed by property crimes (32%). There was a low reported overall rate of sexual violence, with a reported nationwide prevalence rate ranging from 2% to 13%. The UNDP suggested that this was possibly attributable to reluctance on the part of female youth to report such cases due to entrenched cultural and social stigmas, though male youth {{were more likely to report}} crimes in general. Most incidents of sexual assault occurred within the context of the insurgency in southern Somalia. Over the first quarter of 2013, Amnesty International reported that 56.7% of victims in Mogadishu were internally displaced persons. According to Human Rights Watch, the government in 2013 developed comprehensive judicial and security reform plans, but had not yet followed through on those commitments. At least two women who reported rape were also prosecuted for <b>prevarication,</b> but were later released following appeals.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have suggested that}} Rajneesh, like other charismatic leaders, {{may have had a}} narcissistic personality. In his paper The Narcissistic Guru: A Profile of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, Ronald O. Clarke, Emeritus Professor of Religious Studies at Oregon State University, argued that Rajneesh exhibited all the typical features of narcissistic personality disorder, such as a grandiose sense of self-importance and uniqueness; a preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success; a need for constant attention and admiration; a set of characteristic responses to threats to self-esteem; disturbances in interpersonal relationships; a preoccupation with personal grooming combined with frequent resorting to <b>prevarication</b> or outright lying; and a lack of empathy. Drawing on Rajneesh's reminiscences of his childhood in his book Glimpses of a Golden Childhood, he suggested that Rajneesh suffered from a fundamental lack of parental discipline, due to his growing up in the care of overindulgent grandparents. Rajneesh's self-avowed Buddha status, he concluded, was part of a delusional system associated with his narcissistic personality disorder; a condition of ego-inflation rather than egolessness.|$|E
25|$|After some <b>prevarication</b> {{and after}} Winston Churchill had {{actually}} ordered British troops to assault the rebels, Collins decided {{he had to}} act and borrowed British artillery to shell {{the republicans in the}} Four Courts. They surrendered after a two-day (28–30 June 1922) artillery bombardment by Free State troops but some of their IRA comrades occupied O'Connell Street, which saw street fighting for another week before the Free State army secured the capital. (See Battle of Dublin). Over 60 combatants were killed in the fighting, including senior republican Cathal Brugha. About 250 civilians are also thought to have been killed or injured, but the total has never been accurately counted. Oscar Traynor conducted some guerrilla operations south of the city until his capture in late July 1922. Ernie O'Malley, the republican commander for the province of Leinster was captured after a shootout in the Ballsbridge area in November 1922. On 6 December 1922, the IRA assassinated Sean Hales a member of Parliament as he was leaving Leinster House in Dublin city centre, in reprisal for the executions of their prisoners by the Free State. The following day, the four leaders of the republicans in the Four Courts (Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Dick Barret and Joe McKelvey) were executed in revenge. Dublin was relatively quiet thereafter, although guerrilla war raged in the provinces. The new Free State government eventually suppressed this insurrection by mid-1923. In April, Frank Aiken, IRA chief of staff, ordered the anti-treaty forces to dump their arms and go home. The civil war left a permanent strain of bitterness in Irish politics that did much to sour the achievement of national independence.|$|E
500|$|After the Japanese {{victory in}} the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95, both Russia and Japan had ambitions to control Manchuria and Korea which {{naturally}} caused problems between them. A further issue was the Russian failure to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in October 1903 as promised. Japan had begun negotiations to reduce the tensions in 1901, but the Russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve the problems. Japan interpreted this as deliberate <b>prevarication</b> designed to buy time to complete the Russian armament programs. The final straws were news of Russian timber concessions in northern Korea and the Russian refusal to acknowledge Japanese interests in Manchuria while continuing to place conditions on Japanese activities in Korea. These caused the Japanese government to decide in December 1903 that war was now inevitable. The Pacific Squadron began [...] in the outer harbor at night as tensions with Japan increased, in order to react more quickly to any Japanese attempt to land troops in Korea.|$|E

2500|$|On 30August 1948, {{ten months}} after his release from British custody, the {{government}} of Poland requested the extradition of Braemer on the charge of murder of twenty hostages and hundreds of civilians in Poland in 1939. [...] By the admission of British Foreign Office personnel, {{the facts of the}} case were never in dispute, [...] "not even by Braemer himself". Nevertheless, after legal manoeuvrings and much <b>prevarication</b> intended to shield Braemer from responsibility for his crimes, the extradition request was refused in September 1950 by the Government of the United Kingdom. According to some sources, the Polish request for Braemer's extradition was initially presented to (and denied by) the British authorities as early as 1945. In a ruling by the British Extradition Court in Hamburg that has only recently [...] half a century after the fact [...] been called into question by some British historians such as Donald Bloxham, Braemer was in effect declared innocent of war crimes on the grounds that the execution ordered by him of the hostages in question [...] "had been so ordered in accordance with the law of nations".|$|E
2500|$|The Fortescue {{volume was}} to have covered the war but he wrote so slowly, that {{it was decided to}} end his volume at May 1915 and only cover France. Edmonds also came to doubt the quality of the work, judging Fortescue to be ignorant of the {{workings}} of a contemporary army, apparently being [...] behind the times; Fortescue had excluded dates and times and used obsolete language. Fortescue agreed to revise his draft but then took no notice, his second draft being confused, containing nothing about the general situation and hardly referring to the Germans. Senior officers were ridiculed, the government blamed for not stopping the war and the French effort was [...] "slurred over in less than one typewritten page". Edmonds blamed Fortescue for lacking interest, lethargy and ignoring the records made available, bungling the chance to write an exciting story of the BEF, by delivering a patchwork of unit diaries. At the end of the year, Edmonds decided to rewrite the work because of Fortescue's <b>prevarication</b> and [...] "grossly inaccurate and misleading" [...] writing; Fortescue was sacked and Edmonds even wanted him to be made to pay back his salary. After the unfortunate experience with Fortescue, Edmonds decided that an account must be enhanced by statements, private records of officers and by German material, to counter [...] "garbled" [...] accounts by the likes of Arthur Conan Doyle and John Buchan. Soundings with publishers and authors convinced Edmonds, that a work based on dispatches would fail to engage the public. An educational work needed a foundation on which to base teaching, conclusions which were similar to those of Hankey, that a work must be readable enough for the public to buy, be a credible educational work for the military student and rebut inaccurate commercial accounts by [...] civilian authors.|$|E

They theorized that Wynn had overheard Wykel talking about cars, and seen him showing his cash, at McDonald's one morning, and decided he would make a good mark for another confidence scheme. To support this theory they put on four witnesses who previously had been Wynn's victims in similar schemes. In those cases, Wynn asked a portion of the price for something greatly desired by them, and claimed he was able to help them purchase, but never completed the deals.

When Wentworth was posted to Ireland in 1632, Laud brought his personal correspondence from him rapidly to the king's attention. It is in this correspondence, in 1633, that the term [...] "Thorough" [...] appears. In practical terms it meant the pursuit of ambitious policy objectives, on behalf of the king, disregarding special interests, and, particularly, legalistic <b>prevarications.</b> There were opponents at court: Richard Weston, 1st Earl of Portland, Francis Cottington, 1st Baron Cottington and Queen Henrietta Maria. Cottington observed that Laud could not keep his temper in Council meetings, and by 1637 Laud found he could not follow Wentworth in imagining their push for rigid policies would succeed.|$|R
