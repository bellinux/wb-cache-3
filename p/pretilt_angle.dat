With precise control of the irradiance, such PA provides good control on the <b>pretilt</b> <b>angle</b> that can be tuned {{in the range of}} 1 °– 89 °. Therefore, the precise control of the irradiance generates a spatially varying <b>pretilt</b> <b>angle</b> with any desired <b>pretilt</b> <b>angle</b> profile.

40|$|The {{study of}} inhomogeneous {{surfaces}} for liquid crystal alignment has witnessed a {{rapid growth in}} recent years. Such alignment is capable of generating high <b>pretilt</b> <b>angles</b> for liquid crystal. Several experiments showed that high <b>pretilt</b> <b>angles</b> {{could be applied to}} different applications such as multi-stable displays and No Bias Bend fast response time displays. This type of alignment surfaces generally comprises two kinds of domains favoring different liquid crystal orientations. The arrangement of those domains can be alternating stripped, checkerboard or even patchy patterns. A new bi-directional alignment surface is developed. Such alignment surface can be used to control the dynamic flow direction of the liquid crystal. The dynamic flow of the liquid crystal becomes arbitrary controllable by driving voltage. Base on this new alignment layer, a bistable twisted nematic liquid crystal display which switches between untwisted and π-twisted states without surface anchoring energy breaking has been fabricated successfully. Hence, such bistable displays can have large cell gap. A new inhomogeneous alignment layer is developed. This alignment layer is capable of generating arbitrary <b>pretilt</b> and azimuth <b>angles</b> for the liquid crystal.

40|$|Abstract—We have {{developed}} a simple optical method based on measurements of phase retardation[1] versus out-of-plane cell ro-tation angle and data analyzed by extended Jones matrix method to obtain pretilt angles of inverse twisted nematic (ITN) and tilted homeotropic liquid crystal (LC) cells. In our Jones-matrix calcula-tions, we have assumed a constant <b>pretilt</b> <b>angle</b> as the LC-director tilt angles throughout the ITN cell {{as well as the}} tilted homeotropic cell. We have compared the measured pretilt angles of the ITN cell with those of an accompanying tilted homeotropic (ATH) cell. The results showed increasing discrepancies between them with increasing rubbing depth for LC alignments. However, these dis-crepancies could be explained by assuming that the surface-LC tilt angle of the ITN cell was equal to the measured <b>pretilt</b> <b>angle</b> of the ATH cell to generate a convex-type LC-director-deformation pro-file within the ITN cell based on Oseen-Frank elastic continuum theory with infinite anchoring energies.

40|$|Abstract — The recent {{development}} of polymer-induced <b>pretilt</b> <b>angle</b> in multi-domain vertical-align-ment liquid-crystal (LC) structures is reviewed. To create {{a small but}} well-defined <b>pretilt</b> <b>angle,</b> ~ 0. 1 wt. % of a photo-curable monomer was mixed in an LC host and a bias voltage was applied to reorient the LC directors within each domain. The monomers are polymerized near the substrate sur-faces by UV exposure. The formed polymer layers change the surface <b>pretilt</b> <b>angle</b> of the LC from 90 ° to about 89 ° with a defined azimuthal orientation. Consequently, within each domain the LC reori-entation direction responding to the external field is well-defined which leads to faster rise time and higher transmittance.

40|$|We study {{dynamical}} {{processes in}} a multi-domain (MD) structured nematic liquid crystal cell {{with a particular}} emphasis on the motion, creation and annihilation of disclinations. In the MD cell right- and left-handed director helices alternate due to a special choice of the director <b>pretilt</b> <b>angles</b> at the surfaces. As a result, a net of twist disclinations occurs. We have implemented a numerical algorithm based on a pure rotational dynamics of the director field to monitor {{the motion of the}} defect lines during the switching process, i. e., when an electric voltage is applied to or removed from the cell. We demonstrate that the total light transmission versus time is not affected by the presence of the defects compared to a conventional twisted nematic (TN) cell. If the <b>pretilt</b> <b>angles</b> at the surfaces are sufficiently small, the twisting sense of one species of helices is reversed and a configuration free of defects occurs. On the other hand, for an applied voltage twist disclinations close to the surface have to exist. Therefore, defect lines are created or they annihilate during the switching process. We investigate these situations in detail and reveal the underlying mechanisms. Comment: 9 pages, 9 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

40|$|Two {{measurement}} methods are proposed in this thesis. Firstly, A modified crystal rotation method is developed. Such idea will much reduce the measurement time from several minutes to few milliseconds. More than the short acquisition time, that modified method {{does not require}} any rotation or movement of the test cell. Such features make the modified setup able to install on the production line intrinsically for real time measurement access. Secondly, A completely new <b>Pretilt</b> <b>angle</b> measurement method using synthesized retardation compensator is proposed. Due to the rapid development of Liquid Crystal Display, the parameters configuration of liquid crystal display now becomes very critical and extreme. For some sort of pi-Bi-stable Twist Nematic Cell, its cell gap requires less than 1. 5 um and, also {{in order to further}} reduce the states inter-switching voltage, high <b>Pretilt</b> <b>angle</b> are favorable.

ABSTRACT [Maximum 200 woras) Multilayer polyimide(PI) filmsswere successfully fabricated using the Langmuir-Blodgett(LB) technique. These films were studied in several ways relevant to their use as liquid crystal alignment layers. (1) The influence of dipping speed and creep time on the orientational order of PI-LB films was investigated by means of birefringence measurements. (2) For comparison,; we measured the <b>pretilt</b> <b>angles</b> and polar anchoring strengths of liquid crystal(LC) cells assembled with PI-LB films and rubbed PI-LB films as alignment layers. (3) The anchoring directin of the liquid crystal {{was found to be}} solely determined by the dipping direction of uppermost PI-LB layer, regardless of the dipping direction of deeper layers.

40|$|Fast {{response}} {{liquid crystal}} display can improve motion picture quality and power efficiency. One {{of the most important}} applications is field-sequential-color display. The maximum relaxation time of such liquid crystal device must be less than a few milliseconds (i. e. < 3 ms). In this thesis, three different approaches, which are liquid crystal configuration, alignment layer and driving method, are explored in order to enhance the optical response of the liquid crystal device. A liquid crystal configuration called Stressed Splay Twist (SST) mode is investigated. It exhibits strong and fast optical bounce due to back-flow effect. It is also found that such fast optical transient effect, i. e. < 1. 5 ms, can be controlled by the two voltages driving method effectively. A SST mode field-sequential-color display with QVGA resolution is fabricated. In order to further improve the electro-optical properties of the SST mode, a stacked alignment layer is proposed as well. It is composed of 2 alignment layers which have different preferred alignment directions. Such alignment configuration is capable of generating multiple <b>pretilt</b> <b>angles</b> or azimuth angles on the same substrate. By using such alignment layers, the relaxation path of the SST mode is modified so that two voltages driving method can be avoided. Finally, a modified passive matrix display driving scheme is proposed. The typical response time of the passive matrix liquid crystal device is about 50 ms to 200 ms. The Alt-Pleshko driving method is modified. The response time of the passive matrix displays is promoted to less than < 5 ms.

40|$|<b>Pretilt</b> <b>angle</b> {{and cell}} {{thickness}} are two extremely important parameters {{in predicting the}} behavior of vertically aligned negative nematic liquid crystal (LC) displays. The accurate estimation of <b>pretilt</b> <b>angle</b> and cell thickness is not a trivial task when these devices work in reflective mode, as in liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) vertically aligned nematic (VAN) displays. Usual experimental setups {{are based on the}} proportionality between the retardation of the polarization components of the incident light and the product effective birefringence times thickness. However, any attempt to separate the two product variables is cancelled out by symmetry from reflection. This work shows a relatively simple method capable of separating both variables, allowing accurate, independent measurements of pretilt and thickness, as well as other configurations details, such as residual twist. A simulation model based on the properties of actual reflective displays has been developed. An experimental setup specifically designed for measuring LCOS VAN cells has been prepared. Initial comparisons between experimental measurements of intensity and theoretical results showed some discrepancies that could be explained assuming that the LC profile contains a residual twist from the manufacturing process.
