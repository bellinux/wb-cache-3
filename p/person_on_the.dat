As he leaves, Sonia threatens to punish him for spurning her. The next day, he learns that Sonia has told her husband that he sexually harassed her. Since he has admitted finding Sonia attractive, his claim of innocence is not believed, and the company pressures him into resignation.|$|E

Seven boats were damaged, and many roads on the island were flooded. Before Rammasun struck the South Korean mainland, airline officials canceled 167flights. There were three deaths on the mainland, including one boy who drowned in floodwaters. Damage in the country totaled $9.5million, much of it property damage; there was also damage to the rice crop. Rainfall extended into neighboring North Korea, damaging rice and maize. Later, Rammasun brought the average monthly rainfall in only two days in portions of Primorsky Krai, causing flooding along roads and riverways.|$|E

Scully answers the phone, and the <b>person</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other line, who sounds just like her dead sister Melissa, tells her that someone needs her help. Scully traces the call to a nearby home in San Diego {{where a group of}} cops are investigating the suicide of a woman, Roberta Sim. The lead detective, Kresge, tells Scully that it was impossible for Roberta to have dialed, as she died before the telephone call was made. That night after dinner Scully reveals to her mother that due to her abduction and cancer she is unable to bear children. Scully flashes back to when as a child, she hid her pet rabbit from her brother in a lunchbox, only for it to suffocate and die. Scully receives another telephone call from the same person on her cell phone, which was once again made from the Sim home. Roberta's husband, Marshall, is meeting with two dark-suited men inside his house and has no desire to listen to and help Scully figure out what is going on.|$|E
5|$|During the {{election}} period, a candidate is {{not permitted to}} spend more than $600,000 or 30 cents for each <b>person</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> electoral register, whichever is the greater amount. For the 2017 election, {{based on the number of}} electors as at 28 August 2017, {{the election}} expenses limit was $754,982.40. It amounts to an illegal practice to pay to transport voters to or from the poll; or to pay a voter for the use of premises to display a notice, unless the voter is an advertising agent or the transaction is carried out in the ordinary course of business. It is also an illegal practice for a person to borrow or lend, hire or rent out, or use any motor vehicle to convey voters other than himself and his family members to or from the poll. Committing an illegal practice is a criminal offence, the penalty for which is a fine of up to $2,000 and disqualification for three years from being a voter or a candidate for Parliament or the office of President.|$|E

Despite extensive property damage, there were no ground fatalities, only one <b>person</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground was hospitalized. All six crew members were killed, including the co-pilot, who had ejected. The co-pilot's ejection seat was found in Lake St Clair, but his body was not recovered until the following spring.
