5|$|As a {{developing}} tropical cyclone, the storm produced increased winds and lower <b>pressures</b> <b>in</b> the Swan Islands, {{off the coast}} of Honduras.

50|$|When {{the left}} {{ventricle}} contracts (systole), <b>pressure</b> rises <b>in</b> the left ventricle.

Alibek's stories about the former Soviet program's smallpox activities have never been independently verified.|$|E
5|$|The {{system that}} would become Hurricane Alicia {{originated}} from {{the western end of}} a frontal trough that stretched from New England to the Gulf of Mexico.

On August 15, a ship recorded a minimal pressure of 1015millibars (29.99inHg), when the system was upgraded into Tropical Storm Alicia.

5|$|Although the low {{initially}} exhibited features {{typical of}} a monsoon trough, surface observations suggested that surface <b>pressures</b> <b>in</b> {{the vicinity of the}} low began to fall on September4. Consequently, the TFCA was re-issued at 10:00UTC. Eight hours later, Dvorak intensity estimates for the storm reached T2.0/, prompting the JTWC to upgrade the system into a tropical depression, although post-storm analysis from the agency indicated that the system attained tropical depression status at 00:00UTC on September4 and tropical storm intensity at 18:00UTC that day. At 06:00UTC on September5, the JMA followed suit and classified Gerald as a tropical storm. Meanwhile, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Neneng. The JTWC initially expected Gerald to re-curve east of the Philippines; however, the storm's circulation remained quite shallow and embedded within the monsoon trough, causing Gerald to meander. The JMA upgraded Gerald into severe tropical storm during the evening hours of September5.|$|E
5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms {{depend on the}} form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be added with a differential. A hydraulic adder can add the <b>pressures</b> <b>in</b> two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); this can be accomplished roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Emilia was, at the time, {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone on {{record in the}} Central Pacific Ocean, and the first of such to be classified as a Category5 hurricane– the highest rating on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.

The fifth named storm and {{the first of three}} Category 5hurricanes of the 1994 hurricane season, Emilia developed from an area of low pressure southeast of Hawaii on July16. Tracking westward, the initial tropical depression intensified into a tropical storm several hours after tropical cyclogenesis. Subsequently, Emilia entered the Central Pacific Ocean and moved into the area of responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center(CPHC).|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Rusty was a strong, slow-moving {{tropical}} cyclone that produced record duration gale-force winds in Port Hedland, Western Australia in late February2013. Originating {{as an area}} of low pressure on 22February well to the northwest of the Kimberley region of Western Australia, the precursor to Rusty steadily developed within a favourable environment. Gradually decreasing surface <b>pressures</b> <b>in</b> the region signaled intensification and the low was classified as Tropical Cyclone Rusty on 23February. Although a large, sprawling system, near-record high sea surface temperatures enabled Rusty to quickly deepen. Becoming essentially stationary on 25February, the system acquired hurricane-force winds as its core improved in structure. The cyclone achieved its peak intensity two days later with maximum ten-minute sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph) and a barometric pressure of 944hPa (mbar; 27.88inHg). Thereafter, interaction with land caused its core to collapse before the system made landfall near Pardoo Station. Rusty weakened below cyclone strength on 28February. Its remnants persisted over Western Australia for several more days before being absorbed into an extra{{tropical cyclone}} on 5March.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the interwar period, {{elements}} of the fleet conducted visits to ports throughout the Mediterranean, but few fleet exercises occurred due to budget <b>pressures.</b> <b>In</b> 1930, the Maritime Air Force was divorced from Royal Yugoslav Army control, and the naval air arm began to develop significantly, including the establishment of bases along the Adriatic coast.

In the same year, five locally-built minelayers were added to the fleet. A hiatus of several years followed, and it was not until 1936 that any further major acquisitions were made, with the purchase of eight German-built MTBs. Over the next two years, the fleet was significantly strengthened by the acquisition of three French-designed destroyers, marking the high point of Yugoslav naval strength. On the eve of World War II, the navy consisted of 611 officers and 8,562 men, operating 41 combatant ships and 19 auxiliaries.|$|E
