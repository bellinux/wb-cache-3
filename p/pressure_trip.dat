Silicon waveguides are now compatible with CMOS transistors {{on the same}} wafer and these circuits are known as optical integrated circuits. This thesis is {{a small part of}} the integrated photonics project, which has an objective of fabrication and characterization of silicon photonic devices at RIT. The objective of this project was to make a new shallow etch recipe with etch rate of 100 nm/min with STS etcher tool for silicon waveguide fabrication. This shallow etch recipe will be used to develop a waveguide demonstration platform for education in integrated photonics fabrication at RIT. The pseudo bosch process was used to etch the six inch patterned silicon wafers in the ICP/RIE based tool. To control the chamber parameters recipes were designed using the different DOE approaches. The results were analyzed using the SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy). An etch rate of 100 nm/min giving straight smooth sidewall patterns were observed using the designed etch recipe with RF power (725 W), platen power (10 W) C 4 F 8 (60 sccm), SF 6 (19 sccm), O 2 (10 sccm), Argon (40 sccm) and a manual APC Mode with 80 % pressure, 5 mTorr base pressure and 94 mTorr <b>pressure</b> <b>trip.</b> Clean recipe is run with O 2 (30 sccm) for 20 min with 800 W RF power and 20 W platen at 10 Torr pressure.

40|$|Abstract Boundary layer {{velocity}} vectors over a 16 % elliptic airfoil at a Reynolds {{number of}} 3 × 105 were measured {{by using a}} two dimensional particle image velocimetry with high magnification. To see {{the inside of the}} thin boundary layer in detail the magnification factor was increased up to about 60 pixels/mm by inserting extension tube between the lens and CCD camera. Tests were performed with and without boundary layer transition trip attached on the both surfaces at 10 % chord for comparison between laminar and turbulent boundary layers. Surface mount hot film sensor was also used to determine boundary layer transition from laminar to turbulent or relaminarization from turbulent to laminar by inspecting intermittency factors. The purpose of this research was to determine the boundary layer transition behavior as angle of attack changes. The experimental results indicates that as angle of attack increases boundary layer transition position moves toward leading edge on the suction side while laminar boundary layer remains unchanged on the pressure side with smooth surface condition. On the contrary, turbulent boundary layer on the <b>pressure</b> side of <b>trip</b> surface condition is relaminarized as angle of attack increases causing early laminar boundary layer separation. This verifies that the results revealed in previous research concerning lift curve slope higher than 2 πα at low angles of attack and lower than 2 πα at high angles of attack, which {{is quite different from the}} case of conventional airfoils.

40|$|AbstractDuring well-killing {{operations}} for the workover of low-pressure gas wells, formation pressure should be balanced {{so as to guarantee}} well control safety by preventing natural gas overflow. In this paper, a laboratory evaluation was conducted with fuzzy-ball fluids as killing fluids. The results show that, the fuzzy-ball fluid, with a density of 0. 5 – 1. 5  g/cm 3 and a viscosity up to 78, 50, 000  mPa·s at a low shear rate, realizes controllable performance and forms piston-like plugging slugs of solid-free high structural strength on natural gas wellbore after bonding. During well workover, multiple fluid column pressures were set up by injecting fuzzy-ball fluids with different densities at various rates. Owing to high structural strength of the fluids at a low shear rate, natural gas breaks through only inside the piston-like slug and cannot flow upwards to the ground, so the pathways of natural gas in the wellbore are isolated from the ground surface. Moreover, the fluid can wholly move up and down like a piston-like plug, with the change of formation <b>pressures</b> or the <b>tripping</b> of pipe strings. Like the conventional operations, the production can be restored after the workover, so long as the fluid in wellbore is cleaned by means of gas lift. In a natural gas field in NW China, where the formation pressure coefficient dropped to 0. 60 – 0. 82, three wells were fully filled with fuzzy-ball workover fluids for 7 days and another three wells were treated with the piston-like plugs of fuzzy-ball workover fluids for only 3 days. They all presented better technical results. The technology provides a new way for low-pressure gas well workover...|$|R
40|$|The {{exploration}} and development {{of oil and gas}} reserves located in harsh offshore environments are characterized with high risk. Some of these reserves would be uneconomical if produced using conventional drilling technology due to increased drilling problems and prolonged non-productive time. Seeking new ways to reduce drilling cost and minimize risks has {{led to the development of}} Managed Pressure Drilling techniques. Managed pressure drilling methods address the drawbacks of conventional overbalanced and underbalanced drilling techniques. As managed pressure drilling techniques are evolving, there are many unanswered questions related to safety and operating pressure regimes. Quantitative risk assessment techniques are often used to answer these questions. Quantitative risk assessment is conducted for the various stages of drilling operations – drilling ahead, tripping operation, casing and cementing. A diagnostic model for analyzing the rotating control device, the main component of managed pressure drilling techniques, is also studied. The logic concept of Noisy-OR is explored to capture the unique relationship between casing and cementing operations in leading to well integrity failure as well as its usage to model the critical components of constant bottom-hole pressure drilling technique of managed <b>pressure</b> drilling during <b>tripping</b> operation. Relevant safety functions and inherent safety principles are utilized to improve well integrity operations. Loss function modelling approach to enable dynamic consequence analysis is adopted to study blowout risk for real-time decision making. The aggregation of the blowout loss categories, comprising: production, asset, human health, environmental response and reputation losses leads to risk estimation using dynamically determined probability of occurrence. Lastly, various sub-models developed for the stages/sub-operations of drilling operations and the consequence modelling approach are integrated for a holistic risk analysis of drilling operations...|$|R
40|$|Lakvijaya Power {{station with}} a {{capacity}} of 300 MW is designed to deliver generated power to national grid initially over Veyangoda transmission lines. But {{there is no other}} auxiliary power supply from the grid. In addition to above lines, there is no other auxiliary power supply from the grid. Since commissioning of the plant, two incidents have taken place showing the inadequacy of the existing arrangement. At 12. 15 hours on 7 th June 2011, the Plant had been in operation at 260 MW & 181 MVar and Veyangoda line 1 and 2 tripped from Veyangoda end which resulted in an Island wide blackout. Lakvijaya machine tripped without stabilizing at the house load. Consequently the plant was without an electricity supply. At the same time Standby diesel generator of 800 kVA failed to start. Further, Plant DC supply failed causing an unsafe shutdown resulting damages and lifetime reductions to the plant and its subsystems such as rupturing of the diaphragm in LP turbine, drop in drum water level below tripping limit, rising condenser hot well level closer to the tripping limit, rising condenser vacuum <b>pressure</b> up to <b>tripping</b> limit, rising condenser steam temperature to a level which effect to condenser tubes and damaging of bearing due to pressure dropped in jacking oil pressure etc. A similar failure took place on 08 th August 2012. This study is carried out to investigate the different options available to improve power supply situation eliminating such incidents in future. Initially all subsystems of the plant had been thoroughly analyzed and identified all possible bad consequences on the subsystems due to improper shutdown. A time analysis was done to find out the time taken by each subsystem to reach its tripping limits or withstanding time of subsystem before component failure during such an improper shutdown process. After collecting data from the site, detailed power system analysis including load flow studies were conducted using the ‘Power World Simulator’ software package considering possible unit auxiliary standby power supply options available during blackout condition. In that analysis below mentioned seven possible options were identified and studied. i) from Kothmale power plant, ii) from Kelanitissa Fiat gas turbine power plant, iii) from Kelanitissa combine cycle power plant, iv) from Kerawalapitiya combine cycle power plant, v) from Heladanavi diesel plant at Puttalam through 220 kV line, vi) from Heladanavi diesel plant at Puttalam through 33 kV line, vii) from 6 × 2. 5 MW diesel plants at Lakvijaya power station.
