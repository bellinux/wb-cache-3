60|$|It was Mrs. Hilbery; her {{entrance}} {{created some}} {{stir in the}} shop; many <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|E
60|$|I {{have said}} that I began to laugh, and now I kept on. I just sat down and roared, so that the <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me.|$|E
6000|$|The young <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{each other}} with eyes of recognition, and as Hal made his best bow, he said, 'Forsooth, lady, I did not know myself till afterwards.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Three hours ago, sir,' said Dare. 'Having {{finished}} that, I came to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the church--fine building--fine monuments--two interesting <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> them.' ...|$|R
60|$|And the {{excellent}} <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{one another with}} a certain self-satisfaction, for they had the fearless gaze of the king of birds in face of that brilliant orb.|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh?" [...] Aaron looked up. [...] "Me? No, not me." [...] A sort of inertia {{kept him}} rooted. The young <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{one another and}} began to laugh, rather embarrassed.|$|E
6000|$|The <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{the little}} {{old man in}} amazement. [...] "Men of Manator," [...] he cackled in his thin, shrill voice, [...] "wouldst be ruled by a coward and a liar?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my way {{is short}} and simple. We must put things into our rooms that <b>people</b> will <b>look</b> <b>at,</b> {{so that they will}} forget to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the {{furniture}}, and never once trouble their heads about it. <b>People</b> never <b>look</b> <b>at</b> furniture so long as there is anything else to look at; just as Napoleon, when away on one of his expeditions, being told that the French populace were getting disaffected, wrote back, 'Gild the dome des Invalides,' and so they gilded it, and the <b>people,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> that, forgot everything else." ...|$|R

40|$|As {{with social}} anxiety, {{people with high}} social {{appearance}} anxiety (SAA) might experience increased perceptions of being <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> by others and elevated levels of self-focussed evaluative attention (SFEA). This study tested whether individuals with high SAA perceive more <b>people</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them than do those with low SAA, and whether SFEA increases this perception. A sample of 52 low SAA and 48 high SAA participants completed questionnaires and experimental tasks online. Participants estimated the proportion of <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> them in numerous matrices of faces. A control task of matrices of clocks was used. SFEA was experimentally manipulated. Those high in SAA estimated more <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> them, and reported higher trait self-focussed attention. Increasing SFEA increased these individual’s estimates of faces <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> them but did not affect perceptions of non- social stimuli. Implications for clinical interventions and the body image literature are discussed. Future lines of research are recommended...|$|R
6000|$|Radbourn's tone had in it reproach and a noble suggestion. The <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him curiously. The deacons nodded {{their heads}} {{together}} in counsel, {{and when they}} turned to the desk Pill was gone! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{four young}} <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> each other. What did this mean? Had the {{servants}} {{left in a}} body? Did they know that {{something was going to}} happen? Such were the mute questions which their looks asked each other.|$|E
60|$|Then the <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> one another, {{waiting for}} {{something}} to do, not knowing where to begin. Their eyes were beginning to flame, and their hands to itch for destruction. Checco saw their feeling, and at once pointed to the Palace.|$|E
5000|$|Michelle {{is killed}} by the killer in the backseat. This legend is also {{referenced}} by various <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the backseat or talking about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Couldn't {{you give}} {{the feeling of the}} <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it?" [...] {{suggested}} his wife, and she put out her hand to lay it on his.|$|R
40|$|Studying how <b>people</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{a product}} is {{important}} for understanding human interpretation of design products. This research studies the perception of design products {{by using eye tracking}} technology and applying established usability research methods. The gaze path analysis shows that <b>people</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the same product differently depending on their motivation. Our initial findings suggest that people have at least three different first impression perception strategies - narrow, holistic and combined strategy. New knowledge of how people perceive products may help designers in presenting their ideas and in completing the designs...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nay, I did {{not kill}} your goat; it was Isuro, and he ate the meat, and hung the bones round my neck. So it is he who should die!' And the <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> each other, for they knew not what to believe. At length one man said: ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{they were}} alone the two young <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> each other in silence, Jennie with big, horrified eyes, Curtis with an amused {{comprehension}} of his sister's feeling. [...] "Isn't he a pirate? He doesn't know it, but {{his state of mind}} makes him indictable for murder on the high seas." ...|$|E
6000|$|Beppo did {{not know}} how to come to the king, so he stood there and waited and waited. The <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him and whispered to one another: [...] "Who is that young man?" [...] "Whence comes he?" [...] Then one said: [...] "Is not he the young man who served the king with cakes and milk in the forest yesterday?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "We {{were looking}} for a place to sit when we saw some <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{something}}… We didn't know what it was… We joked that maybe it was something from Plum Island." ...|$|R
50|$|When he {{finishes}} the invention, {{it changes the}} way <b>people</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the world, but not the world itself. His success changes him, however, because he loses {{an important part of}} himself.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{have been}} photographing for thirty-five years, but the {{photographs}} I take {{are not for}} White <b>people</b> to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Native <b>people.</b> I take photographs so that Native <b>people</b> can <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Native <b>people.</b> I make photographs for Native people." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{proposition}} {{had suggested}} {{itself as a}} quick escape from publicity, for many eyes were regarding her. She had hoped that sufficient time had elapsed for the extinction of curiosity; but it was quite otherwise. The <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her with tender interest as the deserted girl-wife--without obtrusiveness, and without vulgarity; but she was ill prepared for scrutiny in any shape.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{among us}} {{can hope to}} conquer this great beast?" [...] asked the King, in dismay. [...] "Yet {{something}} must be done, or soon we shall not have a tree left standing in all the Valley of Mo." [...] The <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{one another in a}} frightened way, but no one volunteered his services or offered to advise the monarch what to do.|$|E
6000|$|There Mr Merdle {{insisted on}} {{alighting}} and going his way a-foot, and leaving his poor equipage at Mr Dorrit's disposition. So the dream increased in rapture when Mr Dorrit {{came out of}} the bank alone, and <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him in default of Mr Merdle, and when, with the ears of his mind, he heard the frequent exclamation as he rolled glibly along, 'A wonderful man to be Mr Merdle's friend!' ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{imagined}} <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it then <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{the landscape}} and for oncereally seeing it & being happier for it & believing in God & then thebrotherhood of men & the futility of war. Colin McCahon to Toss Woollaston (1939) ...|$|R
40|$|Browsing the Web {{is usually}} a lonely task. People visit sites, collect {{information}} and {{are not aware of}} other <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the same material, people with whom they could exchange experiences and ideas about the subject they are <b>looking</b> <b>at.</b> A Collaborative Browsing System (CoBrow) [13] has been developed to bring awareness to the World Wide Web. CoBrow users can see other <b>people</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the same Web pages they are <b>looking</b> <b>at.</b> The Multimedia Session Manager (MSM) is one of the components that currently form CoBrow. It is responsible for initiating and managing multimedia sessions required by CoBrow users. This paper aims to describe the work performed by MSM in managing those users and their sessions...|$|R

6000|$|She {{gave him}} some notes, and watched him curiously as he {{staggered}} out of the room. He forgot the lift, and descended by the stairs, unsteadily, like a drunken person, reeling from the banisters to the wall, and back again. Out in the street, <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him curiously as he turned northward toward Oxford Street. His eyes searched the shop-windows. He hurried along like a man feverishly anxious {{to make use of}} his last stint of strength. He was in search of food! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Annie, too {{grateful}} for the comfort {{he had given her}} to question words whose full purport had not perhaps reached her. [...] "And I assure you, Mr. Peck, I feel very differently about these things since I first talked with you. And I wish to tell you, in justice to myself, that I had no idea then that--that--you were speaking from your own experience when you--you said how working <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> things. I didn't know that you had been--that is, that--" ...|$|E
60|$|From this scene, the {{significance}} of which had just dawned on him, Joe turned his eyes again to his companion. It was a sweet face he saw; one that was sedate, but had a promise of innumerable smiles. The blue eyes could not long hide flashes of merriment. The girl turned, and the two young <b>people</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> each other. Her eyes softened with a woman's gentleness as they rested upon him, for, broad of shoulder, and lithe and strong as a deer stalker, he was good to look at.|$|E
5000|$|Incremental {{decision-making}} and escalating commitment: <b>People</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a decision {{as a small}} step in a process, and this tends to perpetuate a series of similar decisions. This can be contrasted with zero-based decision-making (see Slippery slope).|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{been right}} in the advice you have given me more than once. You seem to know how prosperous, and what you call stereotyped, <b>people</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> things. But you've never {{explained}} where you acquired the knowledge." ...|$|R
