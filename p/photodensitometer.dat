40|$|An initial {{investigation}} {{exploring the}} effects of gravity on the crystallization of macromolecular systems has been completed. Monodisperse poly(ethylene), molecular weight 48, 000 was melted and recrystallized under gravitational conditions: 0, 1, and 2 g. No correlations to gravitational environment were noted for the 20 C/min melt, as monitored with a <b>photodensitometer</b> system. However, post-crystallization testing of the recrystallized samples revealed thicker samples with more regions of large, well defined spherulites for the zero gravity crystallization environment. The results of the post-crystallization analysis have been reviewed and the results related to nucleation concerns. Finally, birefringence data, consistent with, but not explained by, the nucleation scenarios is detailed, and further investigations are proposed...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which reticulocytes were identified in the spleen was studied with special reference to osmotic fragility, using the technique developed for per fusion of the isolated spleen. The erythrocyte osmotic fragility of rabbit blood was measured by a precise and highly reproducible method in which the coil planet centrifuge with accessories and a scanning <b>photodensitometer</b> were used. The analysis of the erythrocyte osmotic fragility curve of blood containing about 20 % reticulocytes collected from bled rabbits showed that the more fragile fraction of the erythrocytes decreased, while the more resistant one increased significantly. Isolated spleens of normal rabbits were perfused with blood containing high percentages of reticulocytes. The hemolytic curve of the blood obtained from the splenic vein was quite {{similar to that of}} normal blood, indicating that osmotically resistant reticuolcytes, which were characterized by their decreased density, were selectively sequestered in the spleen. There is experimental evidence that fragile aged erythrocytes, increasing in size, are preferentially trapped in the spleen. The mechanism for their removal has not yet been determined but it is inferred from these observations that it may be related to their greater size and rigidity. 未成熟赤血球の一部は老化赤血球とともに脾臓などで捕捉されることは周知の事実である. そのメカニズムを検討するため瀉血によって網状赤血球を増加させた血液を用い,正常ウサギ摘出脾臓灌流実験を行った. 灌流前後の血液の赤血球浸透抵抗はcoil planet centrifuge法で測定した. 灌流により浸透抵抗の強い網状赤血球は脾臓で選択的に捕捉された. すでに網状赤血球(比重低下) 及び老化赤血球(浸透抵抗減弱,比重低下) が脾臓で選択的に捕捉されることが報告されている. これらの報告及び本実験結果より脾臓における赤血球の捕捉には赤血球のsize及びrigidityが関係しているものと推論した...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the radiopacity of calcium aluminate cement (Endo Binder) with 3 different radiopacifiers (bismuth oxide, zinc oxide, or zirconium oxide) in comparison with gray mineral trioxide aggregate (GMTA), white MTA, and dental structures (enamel and dentin). Methods: Eighteen test specimens of each cement with thicknesses of 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5, and 3. 0 mm (n = 3) were made by using a stainless steel matrix and were adapted to a standardizing device (8 x 7 cm) with a graduated aluminum stepwedge varying from 2. 0 - 16. 0 mm in thickness. To compare the radiopacity of the cements with that of dental structures, slices of first molars with a thickness increasing from 0. 5 - 3. 0 mm were obtained and placed on the standardizing device. One occlusal radiograph for each tested cement was taken, with exposure time of 0. 1 seconds and focus-film distance of 20 cm. Films were processed in an automatic device, and the mean radiopacity values were obtained by using a <b>photodensitometer.</b> Results: Mean values showed that the thicker the specimen was, the greater was its radiopacity. Only EndoBinder + bismuth oxide (EBBO) and GMTA demonstrated radiopacity values greater than 3. 0 mm of the aluminum scale for all thicknesses. When zinc oxide was used as radiopacifier agent, EndoBinder only reached the desired radiopacity with a thickness of 2. 0 mm, and with zirconium oxide it was 2. 5 mm. Conclusions: Bismuth oxide was the most efficient radiopacifier for EndoBinder, providing adequate radiopacity in all studied thicknesses, as recommended by ISO 6876, being similar to GMTA.
