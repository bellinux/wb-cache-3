500|$|Until {{the late}} 1990s, Highway3 formed a single {{continuous}} [...] route from the Ambassador Bridge to near the Peace Bridge, {{but since then}} has had significant <b>portion</b> <b>transferred</b> to regional and county governments. A {{large segment of the}} route follows the historic Talbot Trail, a settlement road following the northern shore of Lake Erie constructed by Colonel Talbot in the early 1800s as part of a grand settlement plan along the lake front. East of Canborough, the road generally follows older settlement trails: Forks Road, connecting Dunnville with Wainfleet, portions of Sherk's Road, through Port Colborne to Gasline, and the Garrison Road, a military road built west from Fort Erie. The highway was initially designated in 1920, but not numbered until five years later. It originally connected to Niagara Falls, but was rerouted to Fort Erie following completion of the Peace Bridge in the late 1920s. Although a few portions of Highway3 were upgraded in the years since, the highway generally follows the same route as it did in 1930. However, in 1997, segments through Port Colborne and Fort Erie were decommissioned as a provincial highway, followed by a segment of the route from Leamington to Talbotville Royal in 1998. All three now exist as county/regional roads. The portion of Highway3 along Huron Church Road in Windsor was reconstructed as part of the Windsor–Essex Parkway project between 2011 and 2015.|$|E

It had been modified by Douglas, who had also authored the New Mexico Territory and Utah Territory Acts, to mirror the language from the Compromise of 1850. In the bill, a vast new Nebraska Territory was created to extend from Kansas north all the way to the 49th parallel, the US-Canada border. A large portion of Nebraska Territory would soon be split off into Dakota Territory (1861), and smaller <b>portions</b> <b>transferred</b> to Colorado Territory (1861) and Idaho Territory (1863) before the balance of the land became the State of Nebraska in 1867.|$|R

50|$|Before 1949 and the {{creation}} of the Division of Sturt, Boothby covered most of the southern and eastern suburbs of Adelaide, and changed hands several times between the Liberal Party of Australia (and its predecessors) and the Australian Labor Party. The 1949 expansion of parliament saw parts of the southern <b>portion</b> <b>transferred</b> to the newly created Division of Kingston and parts of the eastern <b>portion</b> <b>transferred</b> to the newly created Division of Sturt. The redistribution prior to the 1949 election saw Boothby change from a marginal Labor seat on a 1.8 percent two-party margin to a marginal Liberal seat on a two percent two-party margin. However, as part of the massive Liberal victory in the 1949 election, the Liberals picked up a 9.3 percent two-party swing, turning it into a safe Liberal seat in one stroke. The Liberals have held the seat ever since, and for most of that time it has been fairly safe to safe for that party.|$|E
5000|$|Rathdown (Ráth an Dúin) is the south-easternmost barony in County Dublin, Ireland. It gives {{its name}} to the {{administrative}} county of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. Before County Wicklow was shired in 1606, Rathdown extended further south: it was named after a medieval settlement which grew up around Rathdown Castle, at a site subsequently deserted and now in County Wicklow in the townlands of Rathdown North and South, north of Greystones. The Wicklow barony of Rathdown corresponds to the <b>portion</b> <b>transferred</b> to the new county; although both divisions were originally classed as [...] "half baronies", in the nineteenth century the distinction between a barony and a half barony was obsolete.|$|E
50|$|Wellington {{was one of}} the {{original}} ten Legislative Council districts created by the Legislative Council Act 1870 (33 Vict, No. 13). The district's initial boundary had Bunbury as its main population centre, and reached north to Bannister and south to the Wonnerup Inlet, as well as east to the Great Australian Bight. It was bounded by the district of Fremantle to the north and the districts of Vasse and Albany to the south. After the passage of the Legislative Council Act Amendment Act 1873 (37 Vict. No. 22), the district's boundaries were altered, with some of its northern <b>portions</b> <b>transferred</b> to the new district of Murray and Williams. Murray and Williams replaced Fremantle as Wellington's northern neighbour.|$|R

40|$|Three-dimensional natural {{convection}} in a horizontal channel {{with an array}} of discrete flush-mounted heaters on one of its vertical walls is numerically studied. Effects of thermal conductivities of substrate and heaters and convection on outer sides of the channel walls on heat transfer are examined. The substrate affects heat transfer in a wider range of thermal conductivities than do the heaters. At lower heater thermal conductivities a higher heat portion is transferred by direct convection from the heaters to the adjacent coolant. However, higher substrate conductivity is associated with higher heat <b>portion</b> <b>transferred</b> through the substrate. The innermost heater column is found to become the hottest heater column due to the lower coolant accessibility. The heat transfer in the channel is strongly influenced by convection on the outer sides of the channel walls. Correlations are presented for dimensionless temperature maximum and average Nusselt number...|$|E

50|$|The name of {{the parish}} {{is said to be}} derived from the Gaelic, Fionn-traigh, meaning “the white, or fair margin of coast, or {{boundary}} of coast” an appellation descriptive enough of the greater portion of the parish which lies along the left, or north bank of the Don. The parish is bounded on the south by the river Don, which separates it from the parishes of Dyce, Kinellar and Kintore; by the parish of Keith-hall on the north and west; and by Newmachar on the east. The greatest length of the parish, in a direct line from south to north is 4.5 mi; and its greatest breadth, also in a direct line along the valley of the Don from east to west, is 5.5 mi; and its whole area is estimated to be 7388 acre.
