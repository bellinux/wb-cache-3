25|$|Nitric oxide is a {{compound}} produced by many {{cells of the}} body. It relaxes vascular smooth muscle by binding to the heme moiety of cytosolic guanylate cyclase, activating guanylate cyclase and increasing intracellular levels of cyclic-guanosine 3’,5’-monophosphate, which then leads to vasodilation. When inhaled, nitric oxide dilates the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>vasculature</b> and, because of efficient scavenging by hemoglobin, has minimal effect on the vasculature of the entire body.|$|E
25|$|Imatinib was {{initially}} {{thought to have}} a potential role {{in the treatment of}} pulmonary hypertension. It was shown to reduce both the smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>vasculature</b> in a variety of disease processes, including portopulmonary hypertension. However, a long-term trial of Imatinib in people with pulmonary arterial hypertension was unsuccessful, and serious and unexpected adverse events were frequent. These included 6 subdural hematomas and 17 deaths during or within 30 days of study end.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of nitric oxide is elevated in populations living at high altitudes, which helps these people avoid hypoxia by aiding in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>vasculature</b> vasodilation. Effects include vasodilatation, neurotransmission (see gasotransmitters), modulation {{of the hair}} cycle, {{production of}} reactive nitrogen intermediates and penile erections (through its ability to vasodilate). Nitroglycerin and amyl nitrite serve as vasodilators because they are converted to nitric oxide in the body. The vasodilating antihypertensive drug minoxidil contains an ·NO moiety and may act as an NO agonist. Likewise, Sildenafil citrate, popularly known by the trade name Viagra, stimulates erections primarily by enhancing signaling through the nitric oxide pathway in the penis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSepsis is a {{major cause}} of death worldwide. We show that a plasma protein histidine-rich {{glycoprotein}} (HRG) was decreased significantly in septic mice with cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and supplementary treatment of septic mice with exogenous HRG improved survival, with strong inhibition of tight attachment of neutrophils to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>vasculatures,</b> subsequent immunothrombosis, DIC state, lung inflammation, hypercytokinemia, and activation of vascular endothelial cells (VECs). In contrast, knockdown of HRG by siRNA exacerbated lethality. Purified human HRG reversibly induced morphological changes in human neutrophils in vitro; induction of spherical shape with reduced microvilli and adhesiveness to VECs. HRG maintained the passage of neutrophils through microcapillaries and abolished production of reactive oxygen species. These results suggested that the supplementary therapy with HRG may provide a novel strategy for the treatment of sepsis through suppression of excessive systemic inflammation and immunothrombosis by keeping circulating neutrophils quiescent and preventing uncontrolled activation of VECs...|$|R

2500|$|Any {{process that}} {{increases}} the pressure in the left ventricle can cause worsening of the left-to-right shunt. [...] This includes hypertension, which increases the pressure that the left ventricle has to generate to open the aortic valve during ventricular systole, and coronary artery disease which increases the stiffness of the left ventricle, thereby increasing the filling pressure of the left ventricle during ventricular diastole. [...] The left-to-right shunt increases the filling pressure of the right heart (preload) and forces the right ventricle to pump out more blood than the left ventricle. [...] This constant overloading of {{the right side of}} the heart causes an overload of the entire <b>pulmonary</b> <b>vasculature.</b> [...] Eventually, pulmonary hypertension may develop.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{mitral valve}} area goes less than 1cm2, {{there will be}} an {{increase}} in the left atrial pressures (required to push blood through the stenotic valve). Since the normal left ventricular diastolic pressures is about 5 mmHg, a pressure gradient across the mitral valve of 20 mmHg due to severe mitral stenosis will cause a left atrial pressure of about 25 mmHg. This left atrial pressure is transmitted to the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>vasculature</b> and causes pulmonary hypertension. [...] Pulmonary capillary pressures in this level cause an imbalance between the hydrostatic pressure and the oncotic pressure, leading to extravasation of fluid from the vascular tree and pooling of fluid in the lungs (congestive heart failure causing pulmonary edema).|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the frequency of}} pulmonary embolism in patients evaluated with multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) pulmonary angiography for suspected pulmonary embolism, and to analyze other MDCT findings {{that contributed to the}} diagnosis and treatment in these patients. Methods: Approval for this retrospective study was obtained from the local ethical committee of our hospital. A total of 223 patients (128 male, 95 female, mean age: 58. 6) who underwent MDCT pulmonary angiography for suspected pulmonary embolism between December 2009 - November 2010 were included in the study. Pulmonary CT angiography studies were performed with 64 -detector MDCT device using 70 - 100 ml of non-ionic iodinated contrast material. CT images of all patients were reviewed retrospectively. All findings that may be associated with symptomatology or detected incidentally in patients were recorded. Results: 11. 7 % of the patients (26 / 223) had pulmonary embolism. In 154 of the 197 (78. 2 %) patients who had no pulmonary embolism, imaging findings related the symptoms and clinical findings (62. 5 %) or unrelated –incidental findings (37. 5 %) were detected in lungs, mediastinal structures, chest wall or upper abdominal organs. The most common imaging findings were lung infiltration-consolidation (15. 1 %), atelectasis (13. 5 %) and pleural effusion (13. 1 %). There were no findings at MDCT pulmonary angiography in forty-three (21. 8 %) patients. Conclusions: While majority of the patients evaluated with MDCT pulmonary angiography for suspected pulmonary embolism had no pulmonary embolism, various data that explains symptoms and clinical findings or that is unrelated with the clinical situation can be determined on MDCT pulmonary angiography images in these patients. Therefore, careful examination of the structures other than <b>pulmonary</b> <b>vasculatures</b> in the field of view and the correct interpretation of these findings in MDCT pulmonary angiography images are also important for accurate diagnosis and management of the patients...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to test whether}} the emphasized systemic vasomotion during sympathetic activation in hypertension is shared by the pulmonary circulation. To this end, 10 normotensive and 29 primary hypertensive subjects were investigated during adrenergic stimulation by mental arithmetic and cold pressor test. Both stimuli induced a systemic pressor reaction in both groups, which was mediated through an increase in cardiac output and a mild reduction in vascular resistance during arithmetic and through a predominant rise in systemic vascular resistance during cold. Each of these changes was emphasized in the hypertensive population {{as compared with the}} normotensive one. Pressure in the pulmonary artery remained unchanged during cold and was slightly raised (systolic) during arithmetic in normotensive subjects. On the contrary, in hypertensive subjects systolic and diastolic pulmonary pressures were consistently augmented by both stimuli, and pulmonary arteriolar resistance (dyn sec cm~s) rose from 92 in the baseline to 125 (p < 0. 01) during arithmetic and to 124 (p < 0. 01) during the cold test. This reaction is interpreted as reflecting a neurally mediated vasoconstriction and not as the consequence of mechanical or chemical changes, since no difference was observed in pulmonary wedge pressure, pleural pressure, arterial blood gas levels, and pH between controls and hypertensive subjects in the steady state and during either stressful stimulation. Baseline pulmonary arteriolar resistance was also found to correlate positively with systemic vascular resistance in the hypertensive group. When pressure changes occurred, the time course was similar in the two circuits; resistance increased to a proportionally similar degree in the two districts during the cold stimulus. All these observations support the concept that systemic and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>vasculatures</b> become oversensitive to neural activation and that the two vascular beds are exposed to the same type of dysregulation in systemic hypertension...|$|R

Methods: Thirteen patients had posteroanterior inspiratory/expira-tory chest X-ray films and pulmonary MRA with SJS (6 males, 7 females) were retrospectively studied. Gradient-echo pulmonary MRA was performed in all patients with a 1. 5 T MR unit. MRA imaging was performed in a single breath-hold during the injection of contrast media. Image analysis of the patients was performed. The results of pulmonary artery diameters and <b>pulmonary</b> periph-eral <b>vasculature</b> were compared between normal sides versus the affected sides.

40|$|ABSTRACT Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} {{arterial hypertension}} (IPAH) is a rare disorder with abnormally raised pulmonary arterial pressure. In IPAH, the trigger of the endothelial injury may result from oxidative stress, hypoxia, shear stress, inflammation in conjunction with genetic susceptibility. These epigenetic factors may have an influence on cell growth, differentiation and normal homeostatic functions of the endothelium, by altering endothelial permeability, production of growth factors and coagulation factors. Lung inflammation can lead to increased levels of oxidants that may {{also contribute to the}} development of IPAH. When the production of ROS exceeds, the capacity of the cell to detoxify them decreases and the resulting oxidative stress may be harmful to the integrity of biological tissue. Since in IPAH there is disruption of <b>pulmonary</b> artery <b>vasculature,</b> the generation of free radicals may further aggravate tissue injury and in view of its role in defensive mechanism, qualitative variation of SOD, CAT, AAT in IPAH is investigated in the present study to correlate specific electromorphic associations in its etiopathogenesis. In conclusion the present study revealed that Oxidative stress pathway (ROS/RNS) and inflammatory components may act as modifiers in pathogenicity of IPAH...|$|R
40|$|Origin of {{the right}} {{pulmonary}} artery from the aorta is a congenital malformation usually associated with serious symptoms {{in the first year}} of life and characterized by a poor prognosis. Sixty-five patients with this disorder have been reviewed in the literature, and 95 % presented during the first year with signs of congestive heart failure. All had cardiomegaly by radiographic and electrocardiographic examination. An accurate diagnosis was established by cineangiography, and associated cardiovascular anomalies were present in 85 %. Origin {{of the right}} pulmonary artery from the ascending aorta is much more common than origin of the left pulmonary artery from this vessel (8 to 1). Twenty-three patients were managed without operation with a 30 % 1 -year survival rate. Among those patients managed surgically, the survival rate was 84 % at 1 year. It is now clear that operation should be done as early as possible to prevent irreversible changes occurring in the <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>vasculature</b> since microscopic features of pulmonary hypertension have been seen during the first month of life.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A better {{comprehension}} of the interactions between cells of the adaptive immune system with fibroblasts and endothelial cells is required to understand abnormal extracellular matrix deposition, development of pathologic fibrosis, and vasculopathy. RECENT FINDINGS: Skin T cells with high IL- 4 production potential and peripheral blood T cells preferentially expressing chemokine receptors associated with Th 2 functions are found in individuals with active systemic sclerosis. Animal models indicate that Th 2 cells and IL- 13 can induce muscular hypertrophy in <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>vasculature.</b> In bleomycin-induced fibrosis, B cells produce fibrogenic cytokines upon interaction of an endogenous ligand (hyaluronan) with toll-like receptor- 4. In the sclerodermatous graft versus host model, the lack of tumor necrosis factor-production by CD 4 + T cells is permissive for fibrosis development. Dermal fibrosis and capillary loss typical of systemic sclerosis can be reversible after high-dose immunosuppression and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. SUMMARY: Although immunosuppressive strategies to treat patients with systemic sclerosis and allied conditions are largely disappointing, thus indicating a permissive rather than causative role of immunoinflammatory events characteristic of the disease, new findings stress that cells of the adaptive immune system play important roles in assisting fibrogenesis and vascular abnormalities. This may help in identifying efficacious strategies aimed at their control...|$|R

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{have emerged}} as {{a new class of}} posttranscriptional {{regulators}} of many cardiac and vascular diseases. They are a class of small, noncoding RNAs that contributes crucial roles typically through binding of the 3 ?-untranslated region of mRNA. A single miRNA may influence several signaling pathways associated with cardiac remodeling by targeting multiple genes. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a rare disorder characterized by progressive obliteration of <b>pulmonary</b> (micro) <b>vasculature</b> that results in elevated vascular resistance, leading to right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) and RV failure. The pathology of PH involves vascular cell remodeling including pulmonary arterial endothelial cell (PAEC) dysfunction and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation. There is no cure for this disease. Thus, novel intervention pathways that govern PH induced RVH may result in new treatment modalities. Current therapies are limited to reverse the vascular remodeling. Recent studies have demonstrated the roles of various miRNAs in the pathogenesis of PH and pulmonary disorders. This review provides an overview of recent discoveries on the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of PH and discusses the potential for miRNAs as therapeutic targets and biomarkers of PH at clinical setting.
