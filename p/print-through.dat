2500|$|Under the {{direction}} of recording engineer C. Robert Fine, Mercury Records initiated a minimalist single microphone monaural recording technique in 1951. The first record, a Chicago Symphony Orchestra performance of Pictures at an Exhibition, conducted by Rafael Kubelik, was described as [...] "being in the living presence of the orchestra" [...] by The New York Times music critic. The series of records was then named Mercury Living Presence. In 1955, Mercury began three-channel stereo recordings, still {{based on the principle}} of the single microphone. The center (single) microphone was of paramount importance, with the two side mics adding depth and space. Record masters were cut directly from a three-track to two-track mixdown console, with all editing of the master tapes done on the original three-tracks. In 1961, Mercury enhanced this technique with three-microphone stereo recordings using 35mm magnetic film instead of -inch tape for recording. The greater thickness and width of 35mm magnetic film prevented tape layer <b>print-through</b> and pre-echo and gained extended frequency range and transient response. The Mercury Living Presence recordings were remastered to CD in the 1990s by the original producer, Wilma Cozart Fine, using the same method of three-to-two mix directly to the master recorder.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Print-through</b> is a {{category}} of noise caused by contact transfer of signal patterns from one layer of tape to another. <b>Print-through</b> can take two forms:1) thermo-remanent magnetization induced by temperature, and 2) anhysteretic magnetization caused by an external magnetic field.|$|E
50|$|<b>Print-through</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as bleed-through) is a generally undesirable effect that arises {{in the use of}} magnetic tape for storing analogue information, in particular music.|$|E
50|$|Tape {{formulation}} {{affects the}} retention of the magnetic signal, especially high frequencies, the frequency linearity of the tape, the S/N ratio, <b>print-through,</b> optimum AC bias level (which must be set by a technician aligning the machine to match the tape type used, or more crudely set with a switch to approximate the optimum setting.) Tape formulation varies between different tape types (ferric oxide Fe2O3, chromium dioxide CrO2, etc.) {{and also in the}} precise composition of a specific brand and batch of tape. (Studios therefore generally align their machines for one brand and model number of tape and use only that brand and model.) Backing material type and thickness affect the tensile strength and elasticity of the tape, which affect wow-and-flutter and tape stretch; stretched tape will have a pitch error, possibly fluctuating. Backing thickness also affects <b>print-through,</b> the phenomenon of adjacent layers of tape wound on a reel picking up weak copies of the magnetic signal from each other. <b>Print-through</b> on analog tape causes unintended pre- and post-echoes on playback, and is generally not fully reversible once it has occurred.|$|E

Flanging is added to electric guitar and keyboard parts. Other magnetic tape artifacts include wow, flutter, saturation, noise, and <b>print-through.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{cause of}} <b>print-through</b> {{is due to}} an {{imbalance}} of magnetic and thermal energy in the magnetic particle. Once the magnetic energy is only 25 {{times greater than the}} thermal energy, the particle becomes unstable enough to be influenced by flux energy from the layer above or below the tape. The amount of magnetic energy depends on the coercivity of the particles, their shapes (long, thin particles make stronger [...] "magnets"), the ratio of ideally shaped particles to defective particles, and their crystalline structures. Metal particles, although very small, have very high values of coercivity and are the most resistant to <b>print-through</b> effects because their magnetic energy is seldom challenged by thermal energy. Particles fractured by excessive milling prior to coating will increase levels of print depending on their ratio compared to their well-formed neighboring particles.|$|E

50|$|STF offers high {{versatility}} as it overcomes {{the limitations}} of traditional woven fabrics produced using tows.

5000|$|With {{the advent}} of digital {{recording}} in the late 1970s, many mastering ideas changed.

50|$|The {{advantages}} of DMM (hard surface material) over acetate lacquer cutting (soft surface material) are both sonic and practical: {{because of the}} rigidity of the master disc medium, no groove wall bounce-back effects take place after the cutting has been completed. This preserves the original modulation details in the groove walls much better, especially those involved with sudden fast attacks (transients). The improved transient response, {{as well as the}} more linear phase response of DMM improve the overall stability and depth-of-field in the stereo image. In addition, disturbing adjacent groove <b>print-through</b> sounds (groove echoes) are reduced in DMM. Also, {{there is no need to}} rush the finalized master disc directly into a refrigerator for groove preservation, as in conventional lacquer disc cutting, before processing the master disc to produce matrices for the pressing of the records.|$|E

50|$|Until {{manufacturers}} developed {{new ways}} to mill the oxide, the crystals could easily be broken in the manufacturing process, and this led to excessive <b>print-through</b> (echo). Output from a tape could drop about 1 dB or so in a year's time. Although the decrease was uniform across the frequency range and noise also dropped the same amount, preserving the dynamic range, the decrease misaligned Dolby noise reduction decoders that were sensitive to level settings. The chrome coating was harder than competitive coatings, and that led to accusations of excessive head wear. Although the tape wore hard ferrite heads faster than oxide based tapes, it actually wore softer permalloy heads at a slower rate; and head wear was more a problem for permalloy heads than for ferrite heads. The head wear scare and licensing issues with DuPont kept blank consumer chrome tapes at a great disadvantage versus the eventually more popular Type II tapes that used cobalt-modified iron oxide, but chrome was the tape of choice for the music industry's cassette releases. Because of its low Curie temperature (approximately 386 K), chrome tape lent itself to high-speed thermomagnetic duplication of audio and video cassettes for pre-recorded product sales to the consumer and industrial markets.|$|E

50|$|As {{professional}} audio {{evolved from}} analog magnetic tape to digital media, engineers adapted magnetic tape technology to digital recording, producing digital reel-to-reel magnetic tape machines. Before large hard disks became economical {{enough to make}} hard disk recorders viable, studio digital recording meant recording on digital tape. Mitsubishi's ProDigi and Sony's Digital Audio Stationary Head (DASH) were the primary digital reel-to-reel formats in use in recording studios from the early 1980s through the mid-1990s. Nagra introduced digital reel-to-reel tape recorders for use in film sound recording. Digital reel-to-reel tape eliminated all the traditional quality limitations of analog tape, including background noise (hiss), high frequency roll-off, wow and flutter, pitch error, nonlinearity, <b>print-through,</b> and degeneration with copying, but the tape media was even more expensive than professional analog open reel tape, and the linear nature of tape still placed restrictions on access, and winding time to find a particular spot was still a significant drawback. Also, while the quality of digital tape did not progressively degrade with use of the tape, the physical sliding of the tape over the heads and guides meant that the tape still did wear, and eventually that wear would lead to digital errors and permanent loss of quality if the tape was not copied before reaching that point. Still, digital reel-to-reel tape represented a significant advance in audio recording technology, and most who could afford to record using digital tape generally did.|$|E
5000|$|While <b>print-through</b> {{is a form}} of {{unwanted}} noise, contact printing was used deliberately for high-speed recording of video tape. DuPont invented a form of thermal magnetic duplication known as [...] "TMD" [...] by which a high-coercivity metal tape was brought into direct contact with a chromium dioxide copy tape. The recording on the metal tape was a mirror image of the video signal. Immediately before the chrome copy tape came into contact with the mirror mother master, a focused laser beam heated it to its Curie point at which its value of coercivity dropped to very low values so that it picked up a near perfect copy of the master as it cooled. Sony developed a system known as [...] "Sprinter" [...] that used a similar master source tape forced into close contact with any blank copy tape and run across a transfer head in which a weak AC high frequency sine wave is used to transfer the information anhysteretically to the blank tape with minimal erasure of the source tape on each pass. Sprinter master tapes did suffer enough loss that they had to be replaced after a number of passes. This form of high-speed recording was very cost effective when recording in the EP (extra long play) mode because it was three times faster than recording in SP (standard play) mode while real-time recording took {{the same amount of time}} whether in EP mode that used less tape or SP mode that used a greater amount of tape. High-speed video recording of EP video produce far more consistent results than real-time recording at the slowest VHS speed.|$|E
5000|$|In late 1955, Mercury {{began using}} 3 {{omnidirectional}} microphones to make stereo recordings on 3-track tape. The technique was an expansion on the mono process - center was still paramount. Once the center, single microphone was set, the sides {{were set to}} provide the depth and width heard in the stereo recordings. The center mike still fed the mono LP releases, which accompanied stereo LPs into the 1960s. In 1961, Mercury enhanced the three-microphone stereo technique by using 35 mm magnetic film instead of half-inch tape for recording. The greater emulsion thickness, track width and speed (90 feet per min or 18 ips) of 35 mm magnetic film increased prevention of tape layer <b>print-through</b> and pre-echo and gained in addition extended frequency range and transient response. The Mercury 'Living Presence' stereo records were mastered directly from the 3-track tapes or mag film, with a 3-2 mix occurring in the mastering room. The same technique—and restored vintage equipment of the same type—was used during the CD reissues. Specifically, 3-track tapes were recorded on Ampex 300-3 (½" [...] 3-track) machines at 15 IPS. 35 mm magnetic film recordings were made on 3-track Westrex film recorders. The 3-2 mixdown was done on a modified Westrex mixer. For the original LPs, the mixer directly fed the custom cutting chain. At Fine Recording in NY, the Westrex cutter head on a Scully lathe was fed by modified McIntosh 200W tube amplifiers with very little feedback in the system. Older mono records were made with a Miller cutter head. For the CD reissues, {{the output of the}} Westrex mixer directly fed a DCS analog-to-digital converter and the CDs were mastered on Sony 1630 tapes. No digital enhancement or noise reduction was used.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} shows that the flexural stiffnesses in quasi-isotropic laminates depend strongly on direction corresponding to a circle in the polar stiffness diagram [Ref. 1]. This reveals that it may be a poor assumption to use continuous fiber reinforced plastics for emerging applications in large telescopes. Previous work [Ref. 2] shows that out of plane surface deformations in π/n laminates, where n= 3, 4, and 6, lead to unacceptable surface waviness hindering diffraction-limited performance required in precision optics. Within the industry, it is believed that high surface frequency due to fiber <b>print-through</b> can be eliminated by applying sufficient resin rich layer of more than 10 -mil [Ref. 6]. In this paper, the effects of resin thickness of 5 -mil up to 20 -mil on the surface of a π/ 4 laminate were evaluated to quantify the magnitude of surface undulations. Also, the applicability of various graded and intermediate resin material properties are performed to determine which variables have the most positive influence on the surface deformations and to see feasibility of various mitigation techniques for fiber <b>print-through.</b> Numerical results show that the increased resin buffer layers have more adverse effects on surface quality of the composite mirror, particularly in variable environment conditions. Experiments on a π/ 4 quasi-isotropic laminate fabricated from Bennett Optic Research (BOR) are performed to explore actual surface qualities of the quasi-isotropic mirror.

40|$|Large Area Maskless Photopolymerization (LAMP) is a {{disruptive}} {{additive manufacturing}} technology {{developed in the}} Direct Digital Manufacturing Laboratory at Georgia Tech. Due to polymerization shrinkage during the layer-by-layer curing process, stresses are accumulated that can give rise to cracks and delaminations along the interfaces between adjacent layers. The objective of this doctoral dissertation is to investigate the mechanisms of stress evolution and cracking/delamination during the LAMP manufacturing process through theoretical modeling and experimental characterization methods. The evolving conversion degree in a layer was characterized through Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and {{this leads to a}} so-called <b>print-through</b> curve. The polymerization shrinkage strain in each exposed layer was calculated {{on the basis of the}} theoretical relationship between the volumetric shrinkage and the degree of conversion. Furthermore, the material’s elastic modulus, which also evolves with the degree of conversion, was characterized by three-point bending tests. With the degree of conversion, cure-dependent modulus and shrinkage strain as the three primary inputs, finite element modeling was conducted to dynamically simulate the layer-by-layer manufacturing process and to predict the process-induced stresses. To investigate the fracture process, Mode I and Mode II interlaminar fracture toughness of the LAMP-built laminates was characterized, using the double cantilever beam (DCB) test and the end notched flexure (ENF) test, respectively. In order to predict the crack initiation and propagation occurring in a LAMP-built part, a mixed-mode cohesive element model was developed. The Mode I and Mode II cohesive parameters, which are used to describe the bilinear constitutive behavior of the cohesive elements, were determined by matching the numerical load-deflection curves to the experimental ones obtained from the DCB tests and the ENF tests, respectively. Using this model, the fracture of a hollow-cylinder part was analyzed and the simulation results were compared with experiments. Finally, several possible strategies for mitigating the shrinkage related defects were investigated.

40|$|A {{process for}} {{fabricating}} a precise, diffraction- limited, ultra-lightweight, composite- material (matrix/fiber) paraboloidal telescope mirror has been devised. Unlike the traditional {{process of fabrication}} of heavier glass-based mirrors, this process involves a minimum of manual steps and subjective judgment. Instead, this process involves objectively controllable, repeatable steps; hence, this process is better suited for mass production. Other processes that have been investigated for fabrication of precise composite-material lightweight mirrors have resulted in <b>print-through</b> of fiber patterns onto reflecting surfaces, and have not provided adequate structural support for maintenance of stable, diffraction-limited surface figures. In contrast, this process does not result in <b>print-through</b> of the fiber pattern onto the reflecting surface and does provide a lightweight, rigid structure capable of maintaining a diffraction-limited surface figure {{in the face of}} changing temperature, humidity, and air pressure. The process consists mainly of the following steps: 1. A precise glass mandrel is fabricated by conventional optical grinding and polishing. 2. The mandrel is coated with a release agent and covered with layers of a carbon- fiber composite material. 3. The outer surface of the outer layer of the carbon-fiber composite material is coated with a surfactant chosen to provide for the proper flow of an epoxy resin to be applied subsequently. 4. The mandrel as thus covered is mounted on a temperature-controlled spin table. 5. The table is heated to a suitable temperature and spun at a suitable speed as the epoxy resin is poured onto the coated carbon-fiber composite material. 6. The surface figure of the optic is monitored and adjusted by use of traditional Ronchi, Focault, and interferometric optical measurement techniques while the speed of rotation and the temperature are adjusted to obtain the desired figure. The proper selection of surfactant, speed or rotation, viscosity of the epoxy, and temperature make it possible to obtain the desired diffraction-limited, smooth (1 / 50 th wave) parabolic outer surface, suitable for reflective coating. 7. A reflective coat is applied by use of conventional coating techniques. 8. Once the final figure is set, a lightweight structural foam is applied {{to the rear of the}} optic to ensure stability of the figure...|$|E
40|$|This work {{examines}} a novel {{method of}} dynamic single frame interferometry. In this dynamic approach to phase shifting measurements, steps {{are taken to}} combat performance degradation due to environmental factors such as air turbulence and vibration. We explore the system functionality and performance, and examine some of the limiting factors using this technique such as effects due to imperfect system components, irradiance variations and sensitivity of the instrument accuracy based on calculation methodology. We present the errors associated with these {{various aspects of the}} system and show the majority cause phase calculation errors less than 0. 005 λ P-V to the calculated wavefront. This new approach involves the placement of a micropolarizer phase-shifting array directly onto a CCD camera which allows the construction of a dynamic single frame interferometric system. Hardware and manufacturing preparations such as inspection, positioning and alignment are discussed. Experimental results of system performance are combined with mathematical simulations to provide a performance baseline. We present experimental results showing the effects of averaging on measurement data, which results in a reduction of fringe <b>print-through</b> errors associated with a combination of many of the system error sources...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} of a micromachined silicon deformable mirror (DM) system for the hyper-contrast visible nulling coronagraph architecture designed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA’s Terrestrial Planet Finding (TPF) mission. The new DM is designed to achieve unprecedented optical quality and mechanical positioning precision as required by the nulling coronagraph. It consists of 331 close-packed hexagonal segments on a 600 �m pitch. Each segment has three adjustable degrees of freedom controlling out-of-plane rotation (in two axes) and surface normal motion over a continuous range of ± 3 mrad and 1 �m, respectively. The coronagraph implementation specifies that each segment maintains an overall flatness better than 10 nm RMS, irrespective of segment angle. To achieve this objective, two design concepts were developed in parallel. The first design uses thick mirror segments consisting of epitaxial grown polysilicon (epipoly) to provide the mirror with high rigidity, allowing it to tilt without bending. The epipoly layer can also be highly polished to better than 1 nm RMS local surface roughness. The second design uses thinner, more compliant mirror segments, but supports them with flexure-based electrostatic actuators that decouple tilt motion from mirror segment bending moments. The thinner mirror segment has reduced optical quality due to <b>print-through</b> effects, but offers greater ease in post-processing mirror curvature caused by residual stress gradients. DM segments fabricated with the flexure design experience a maximum mirro...|$|E
