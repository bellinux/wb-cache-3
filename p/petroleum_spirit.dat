50|$|The very lightest, most {{volatile}} {{liquid hydrocarbon}} solvents {{that can be}} bought from laboratory chemical suppliers may also be offered under the name petroleum ether. Petroleum ether consists mainly of aliphatic hydrocarbons and is usually low on aromatics. It is commonly hydrodesulfurized and may be hydrogenated {{to reduce the amount}} of aromatic and other unsaturated hydrocarbons. Petroleum ether bears normally a descriptive suffix giving the boiling range. Thus, from the leading international laboratory chemical suppliers it is possible to buy various petroleum ethers with boiling ranges such as 30-50 °C, 40-60 °C, 50-70 °C, 60-80 °C, etc. In the United States, laboratory grade aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents with boiling ranges as high as 100-140 °C may be called petroleum ether, rather than <b>petroleum</b> <b>spirit.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Petroleum benzine is a {{hydrocarbon}} based solvent mixture that {{is classified}} by its physical properties (e.g. boiling point, vapor pressure) {{rather than a}} specific chemical composition, often obfuscating distinction within {{the long list of}} petroleum distillate solvent mixtures: mineral spirits, naphtha, white spirits, petroleum spirits, turps substitute, mineral turpentine, petroleum benzine, petroleum ether, ligroin, and Stoddard Solvent. The chemical composition of a petroleum distillate can also be modified to afford a solvent with reduced concentration of unsaturated hydrocarbons, i.e. alkenes, by hydrotreating and/or reduced aromatics, e.g. benzene, toluene xylene, by several dearomatization methods. In a document that attempts to draw more concise distinctions between hydrocarbon solvents, conservator Alan Phenix explains that the most important distinction amongst the various hydrocarbon solvents are their boiling/distillation ranges (and, by association, volatility, flash point etc.) and aromatic content. Given the toxicity/carcinogenicity of some aromatic hydrocarbons, most notably benzene, the aromatic content of petroleum distillate solvents, which would normally be in the 10-25% (w/w) range for most petroleum fractions, can be advantageously reduced when their special solvation properties are not required and a less odorous, lower toxicity solvent is desired, especially when present in consumer products. Phenix further points out that [...] "To all intents and purposes petroleum benzine appears synonymous with petroleum spirit." [...] <b>Petroleum</b> <b>spirit</b> is generally considered to be the fractions between the very lightest hydrocarbons, petroleum ether, and the heavier distillates, mineral spirits. For example, petroleum benzine with a boiling range of 36 - 83 °C sold by EMD Millipore under CAS-No. 64742-49-0 is identified in the product MSDS as hydrotreated light petroleum distillates comprising ≥ 90% C5-C7 hydrocarbons, n-alkanes, isoalkanes, and < 5% n-hexane, while Santa Cruz Biotechnology sells a petroleum ether product under the same CAS-No. Fisher Scientific offers a product ‘Benzine (Petroleum Naphtha)' that retails for a high price that would suggest it is a speciality product but in fact conforms to Marathon Petroleum's 'VM&P Naphtha' (Varnish Makers & Painters’ Naphtha) found widely distributed in many hardware stores in North America.|$|E

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis describes the synthesis, characterisation, and reactivity of several mixed anion lithium complexes. Chapter 2 {{is concerned with the}} design, synthesis, and characterisation of the mixed phenol/amine containing ligands, which serve as the backbone for mixed O/N anion lithium complexes also described. N-phenylsalicylaldamine, (ONPhH 2), N- 2, 6 -diisopropylsalicylaldamine (ONDIPPH 2), and N-t-butylsalicylaldamine (ONtBuPhH 2), were prepared from their corresponding imine precursors, which were themselves prepared via imine condensation of the appropriate primary amines with salicylaldehyde. Solid state structures were obtained for the amine compounds, which display intermolecular H-bonding networks. Chapter 2 also details the synthesis, and characterisation of mono- and some dilithiated complexes of the O/N ligands. The monolithiated complexes were observed to exclusively form tetrameric species. The two complexes [Li(ONPhH) 4] and [Li(ONDIPPH) 4] were prepared by lithiation of the corresponding amine ligands with n-BuLi in 40 - 60 °C <b>petroleum</b> <b>spirits.</b> The dilithiated complexes were observed to preferentially form dimers in the solid state. Two dimeric dilithiated complexes [Li 2 (ONPh) 2 (THF) 6] and [Li 2 (ONDIPP) 2 (THF) 4] were prepared by lithiation of the amine ligands with n-BuLi in THF. Several of the lithiated complexes underwent various solvent exchange reactions yielding related complexes; the THF solvated monolithiated tetrameric complex [Li(ONPhH) 4 (THF) 3] was obtained by exposing [Li(ONPhH) 4] to THF, and the dilithiated complexes [Li(ONPh) 2 (TMEDA) 3], [Li 2 (ONDIPP) 2 (TMEDA) 2], [Li(ONPh) 2 (DME) 2 (THF) 2], and [Lh(ONDIPP) 2 (DME) 2] were prepared by exposing the dilithiated THF complexes to TMEDA and DME respectively. (TMEDA = N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine, DME = 1, 2 -dimethoxyethane). A related tetrameric dilithiated complex [Li 2 (ONPh) 4 (THF) 4] was obtained from [Li 2 (ONPh) 2 (THF) 6] by heating in benzene. Chapter 3 describes further solvent exchanged dilithiated complexes. [...] . This chapter also describes the reactivity of some of the dilithiated complexes towards ether type substrates. Cleavage of both aliphatic and aromatic ether molecules was observed, with predictable stereospecificity correlated to the observed geometry of the dilithiated complex. From this reactivity a further monolithiated complex containing a modified N-methylated ligand was obtained [Li(ON(Me) PhH) 4]. Chapter 4 reports the synthesis and characterisation of mixed amide/alkoxide ligands and their complexes. [...] . Chapter 5 is a compilation of some serendipitous compounds that were isolated from reactions described in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3. [...] . Some theoretical work was undertaken to investigate the preference of the dimeric complexes in Chapter 2 towards particular core geometries observed in the solid state.

Each of these regimes was irrigated with borehole water for two weeks, thrice a week to bring about hydration. The three petroleum products were separately diluted with borehole water in 1 : 1 ratio to give 50 % concentrations. Moreover, 100 % of these products were also used. The 50 % concentrations were separately used to irrigate the first three regimes, A, B and C for 20 weeks. The D, E and F regimes were irrigated with 100 % kerosene, petrol and diesel respectively for the 2 weeks and later with borehole water for twenty weeks while the G regime was irrigated with borehole water (Control). Irrigations were done thrice a week. Samples of B. lambarenensis were collected fortnightly for chlorophyll extraction and the chlorophyll a, b and total chlorophyll content determined {{with the aid of}} spectrophotometer. It was observed that the 50 % treated moss plants had greater chlorophyll a, b and total chlorophyll than the control but their concentrations were statistically the same.

40|$|Mentha longifolia has a {{reputation}} in traditional medicine in the indications of diarrhoea and gut spasm. This study was carried out to provide a possible pharmacological basis for its medicinal use in hyperactive gut disorders. In a castor oil induced diarrhoeal model, the crude extract of Mentha longifolia (Ml. Cr), at doses of 100 - 1000 mg/kg, provided 31 - 80 % protection, similar to loperamide. In isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, Ml. Cr caused inhibition of spontaneous and high K(+) -induced contractions, with respective EC(50) values of 1. 80 (1. 34 - 2. 24, n = 6 - 8) and 0. 60 mg/mL (0. 37 - 0. 85, n = 6 - 8), which suggests spasmolytic activity, mediated possibly through calcium channel blockade (CCB). The CCB activity was further confirmed when pretreatment of the tissue with Ml. Cr (0. 3 - 1 mg/mL) caused a rightward shift in the Ca(++) concentration-response curves (CRCs), similar to verapamil. Loperamide also inhibited spontaneous and high K(+) -induced contractions and shifted the Ca(++) CRCs to the right. Activity-directed fractionation revealed that the <b>petroleum</b> <b>spirit</b> fraction was more potent than the parent crude extract and aqueous fraction. These data indicate that the antidiarrhoeal and spasmolytic effects of the crude extract of Mentha longifolia are mediated through the presence of CCB-like constituent(s), concentrated in the <b>petroleum</b> <b>spirit</b> fraction and this study provides indirect evidence for its medicinal use in diarrhoea and spasm...|$|E
