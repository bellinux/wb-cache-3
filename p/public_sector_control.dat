Using a variety of ethnographic methods, the research looked at {{the ways in which the}} members of the governing body translated understandings of neutrality into their everyday practices and how expertise was constructed by the members themselves as well as their perceptions of each other’s expertise. We conclude by relating the findings of our research to other literature on citizen participation and argue that these elements of neutrality and expertise lie in tension with, and constrain, effective participation.

40|$|Public {{space is}} a {{component}} of our physical environment which has {{an important role in}} city life. This thesis is primarily about investigating public space and public realm in the historic city centre of Damascus {{in order to understand the}} potential for its improvement, and secondarily about recommending specific actions towards this. The research takes a qualitative approach focusing on public space as a ‘product’ which is the result of a process. In terms of the product, the nature, morphological and functional aspects of public spaces in Damascus are examined. The governance process is analysed at local level to define main actors, the rules they interact with and the rationalities they use to intervene in public space. This analysis includes locality-specific literature review and interviews with key informants. Such case study analysis is undertaken against the background of a survey of public space regeneration in selected cities around the Mediterranean. Public spaces in Damascus historically developed under strong endogenous social and cultural rules creating a hierarchy of ‘traditional’ spaces which supported public, parochial and private realms. In the contemporary period, these spaces have gone through modernisation in their governance process through introducing new actors and more formal rules, which have led to more ‘publicness’ and tension between tradition and modernisation. This has affected their nature as well as morphological and functional aspects. Analysis showed that strong centralised political and <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>control</b> is found over the governance process through a top-down representative approach. Capacities, interests and perception of public spaces among actors, in addition to poor management, strict legislation and lack of qualified cadres, have all contributed to the continuing deteriorating situation of public spaces. Moreover, interventions for improvement occurred on a short-term basis and mainly to restore historical monuments and improve traffic. An integrated approach to upgrading open spaces is still needed on a long term basis, subject to the available financial resources, with wider governance arrangements and further collaboration and integration between different governmental bodies.

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{reported a}} wide-spread adoption of performance measurement (PM) in governmental organisations, but pointed also {{to a limited}} use for formal organisational control. This research explores various roles that PM can play in the control of governmental organizations, and aims to explain their actual use. A contingency framework is used, inspired by earlier work of Earl and Hopwood on information management variation. Four different archetypal roles of PM are characterized, and it is being assumed that two types of contextual circumstances lead to different roles. One is labelled as a businesslike context, which emphasizes a rational use of performance information for planning and control, including target setting, monitoring, variance analysis and consideration of corrective actions. The other context is called political, and it highlights the use of performance information for achieving a common understanding between various stakeholders with conflicting interests of what is appropriate in the organization, and it may as well legitimate choices made in the past. Four cases were selected and conducted within one large-size municipality in the Netherlands. The cases diverge {{in terms of their}} context – businesslike and political – and in the extent to which activities are standardized. The four cases concern different organizational divisions and were expected to reproduce four different archetypical roles of PM. The case studies show that some roles of PM apparently occur, irrespective of the control context or the level of standardization of activities. This holds for the following roles: diagnostic financial control, influencing and setting future budgets, and progress reporting, some of which are associated with a businesslike control context. However, other PM roles, especially signalling and learning, emerge depending upon contextual circumstances. If a policy field is, for instance, highly politically sensitive, these additional roles are very important, and can under more specific circumstances even lead to tight controls.

40|$|The <b>public</b> <b>sector's</b> {{share in}} wage {{employment}} {{is higher in}} Africa - including Ethiopia's urban labor market - than in developed economies. Fuller unionization, greater job security, and more generous non-wage benefits in the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> lead one to assume that workers might queue up for <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> jobs. Do higher wage rates in Ethiopia's <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> create such a queue? The author extends Lee's two-stage structural probit analysis to test (with data from a recent urban household survey) and measure the existence and scope of such a queue for <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> jobs in Ethiopia. The results reject the absence of job rationing {{in favor of an}} implicit queue of most private <b>sector</b> workers for <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> jobs. The queue exists mainly because of popular expectations of a wage premium (between 11 and 40 percent) in the <b>public</b> <b>sector.</b> <b>Controlling</b> for individual differences in expectations of the sectoral wage differences, the author finds that skill does not significantly affect a worker's sector preferences, but some social characteristics do. A worker with a traditional farming background {{is more likely to be}} in the queue than is a second-generation urban dweller. This is interesting, considering that the influx of rural migrants to urban centers in the last few decades has been partly fueled by hopes of <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> employment. On average, women are more likely than men, and workers in provincial towns more likely than workers in the capital, to prefer <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> jobs. Level of schooling and job experience do not seem to affect preferences for the public over the private sector. The probability of a worker's being selected from the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> queue decreases with the wage rate the worker potentially commands as a <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> employee. Workers on the lower end of the pay scale are more likely to be selected. Among workers who join the queue for <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> jobs, men are more likely to be hired than women and skilled workers are more likely to be hired than less-skilled workers. <b>Public</b> Health Promotion,Public <b>Sector</b> Economics&Finance,Health Monitoring&Evaluation,Statistical&Mathematical Sciences,Economic Systems,Health Monitoring&Evaluation,Economic Stabilization,Inequality,Public Sector Economics&Finance,Macroeconomic Management...|$|R

Based on the demonstrable impact on child development, there is a global commitment to finance and implement control strategies with a focus on school-based chemotherapy programmes. The major obstacle to the implementation of cost-effective control is the lack of accurate descriptions of the geographical distribution of infection. In recent years, considerable {{progress has been made in}} the use of geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) to better understand helminth ecology and epidemiology, and to develop low-cost ways to identify target populations for treatment. This review explores how this information has been used practically to guide large-scale control programmes. The use of satellite-derived environmental data has yielded new insights into the ecology of infection at a geographical scale that has proven impossible to address using more traditional approaches, and has in turn allowed spatial distributions of infection prevalence to be predicted robustly by statistical approaches. GIS/RS have increasingly been used in the context of large-scale helminth control programmes, including not only STH infections but also those focusing on schistosomiasis, filariasis and onchocerciasis. The experience indicates that GIS/RS provides a cost-effective approach to designing and monitoring programmes at realistic scales. Importantly, the use of this approach has begun to transition from being a specialist approach of international vertical programmes to becoming a routine tool in developing <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>control</b> programmes. GIS/RS is used here to describe the global distribution of STH infections and to estimate the number of infections in school-age children in sub-Saharan Africa (89. 9 million) and the annual cost of providing a single anthelmintic treatment using a school-based approach (US$ 5. 0 - 7. 6 million). These are the first estimates at a continental scale to explicitly include the fine spatial distribution of infection prevalence and population, and suggest that traditional methods have overestimated the situation. The results suggest that continent-wide control of parasites is, from a financial perspective, an attainable goal...|$|E

Differences in union premia across workers {{and over time}} are studied using individual-level British Household Panel Survey data and quantile regression techniques allowing for endogeneity of the membership decision. Raw differentials suggest the presence of large positive membership and coverage premia that are stronger {{at the bottom of}} the wage distribution in both private and <b>public</b> <b>sectors.</b> After <b>controlling</b> for other factors influencing wages, union asymmetries are no longer apparent in the private sector. When endogeneity of union membership is taken into account, the private sector union wage premium disappears, indicating that individuals positively select into unions.
