40|$|International audienceBackground and motivation: Previous works {{investigating}} the radiation force of diverging spherical <b>progressive</b> <b>waves</b> incident upon spherical particles {{have demonstrated the}} direction of reversal of the force when the particle is subjected to a curved wave-front. In this communication, the analysis is extended {{to the case of}} diverging cylindrical <b>progressive</b> <b>waves</b> incident upon a rigid or a soft cylinder in a nonviscous fluid with explicit calculations for the radiation force function (which is the radiation force per unit energy density and unit cross-sectional surface) not shown in [F. G. Mitri, Ultrasonics 50 (2010) 620 - 627]. Method: A closed-form solution presented previously in [F. G. Mitri, Ultrasonics 50 (2010) 620 - 627] is used to plot the radiation force function with particular emphasis on the difference from the results of incident plane <b>progressive</b> <b>waves</b> versus the size parameter ka (k is the wave number and a is the cylinder's radius) and the distance of the cylinder from the acoustic source r 0. Results: Radiation force function calculations for the rigid cylinder unexpectedly reveal that under specific conditions determined by the frequency of the acoustic field, the radius of the cylinder, as well as the distance to the acoustic source, the force becomes attractive (negative force). In addition, the numerical results show that the radiation force on a rigid cylinder does not generally obey the inverse-distance law with respect to the distance from the source. Conclusion and potential applications: These results suggest that itmaybe possible, under specific conditions, to pull a cylindrical structure back toward the acoustic source using <b>progressive</b> cylindrical diverging <b>waves.</b> They may also provide a means to predict the radiation force required to manipulate non-destructively a single cylindrical structure. Potential applications include the design {{of a new generation of}} acoustic tweezers operating using a single beam of <b>progressive</b> <b>waves</b> (in contrast to the traditional version of acoustical tweezers in which an acoustic standing wave field is produced using two counter-propagating acoustic fields) for investigations in the field of flow cytometry, particle manipulation and entrapmen...|$|R

40|$|In the {{near-shore}} zone, energetic sea waves generate sheet-flow sand transport. In {{present day}} coastal models, wave-induced sheet-flow sand transport rates are usually predicted with semi-empirical transport formulas, based on extensive {{research on this}} phenomenon in oscillatory flow tunnels. However, recent sheet-flow experiments in large scale wave flumes, with progressive waves instead of oscillatory flow, have shown rather different results compared to the earlier tunnel experiments, namely significantly increased sand transport in onshore direction. This study investigates in detail how progressive waves affect the wave-induced bottom boundary layer flow, the sand transport rates and {{the behavior of the}} sheet-flow layer. Hereto, two numerical modeling tools have been developed and step by step validated, firstly on small scale flume data of wave boundary layer flow over fixed beds, subsequently on large scale flume data of sand transport rates and flow velocities above mobile beds, and finally on measurements of bed erosion. The models have been applied in a numerical parameter study to quantify the importance of various <b>progressive</b> <b>wave</b> effects over a range of wave and bed conditions. Thus, it was found how two competing streaming mechanisms, respectively the onshore directed <b>progressive</b> <b>wave</b> streaming and the offshore directed non-linear wave shape steaming, determine the wave-averaged current profile. Furthermore, it was found that for larger sand grains, <b>progressive</b> <b>wave</b> streaming is the major contributor to the increased onshore transport. However, for finer grains, also an alternating convergence and divergence in horizontal sediment advection contributes increasingly with decreasing grain size. The main result of this study is a detailed insight in how <b>progressive</b> <b>wave</b> effects contribute to sand transport. Next, parameterizations have been developed from the numerical results. These parameterizations form useful building blocks to improve practical sand transport formulas, which will contribute to better predictions of the coastal morphology in engineering practice...|$|E
