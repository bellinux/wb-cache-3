Não é raro encontrar andarilhos de estrada com manifestações de visões e pensamentos delirantes. O objetivo dessa pesquisa foi {{investigar}} possíveis conexões entre a movimentação constante dos andarilhos e a eclosão de delírios. Coletamos e analisamos narrativas de andarilhos, explorando especificamente os conteúdos alusivos à representação de si, de seu mundo e de sua caminhada pelas estradas. Idéias persecutórias, megalomaníacas e depressivas, superinvestidas afetivamente, aparecem com freqüencia nos pensamentos sobre o presente, o passado e nas reflexões sobre os motivos do deslocamento constante. Os resultados sugerem que há uma forte relação entre a movimentação constante e sem destino e as idéias e visões delirantes que os acometem.
