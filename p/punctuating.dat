5|$|Bremner was {{appointed}} manager of struggling Fourth Division side Doncaster Rovers in November 1978. He oversaw a 1–0 win over Rochdale at Belle Vue {{in his first}} match in charge. Results fluctuated during the 1978–79 season, demonstrated by a 7–1 defeat by struggling Bournemouth <b>punctuating</b> a run of five wins in six games. Rovers ended the season in 22nd place, though 11 points ahead of Halifax Town and Crewe Alexandra, and successfully applied to the Football League for re-election.|$|E
5|$|After a {{short period}} of rest while Sattelberg was {{captured}} by the 26th Brigade, in late November the 2/15th joined the advance to Wareo, capturing Nongora village, crossing the Song River, and then undertaking patrols through the Christmas Hills until relieved by elements of the 4th Brigade, which pushed the Australian advance along the coast, forcing the Japanese north towards Sio as the Australians sought to secure the Huon Peninsula. In late December, the 20th Brigade rotated back into the lead, and the 2/15th took over from the 22nd Battalion around the Tunom River, where the battalion headquarters came under aerial attack. After a brief pause near the flood swollen Tunom, the advance continued throughout December and into January 1944 with minor skirmishes <b>punctuating</b> the battalion's advance. Finally, on 21 January, {{at the edge of the}} Sazomu River, the order arrived for the 2/15th to be withdrawn to Finschhafen for rest prior to repatriation to Australia. The fighting in New Guinea cost the battalion 30 killed in action, six dead from wounds, four dead from accidents and 119 wounded.|$|E
5|$|One year later, Celes awakens from a coma on {{a deserted}} island and learns {{that the world}} has been devastated by Kefka, who now dominates it as a god-like ruler. Much of the human {{population}} has died and plant and animal life are slowly being killed by sickness, <b>punctuating</b> humanity's despair. Celes sets out from the Solitary Island to try to reunite with as many of her friends as she can find. Celes is only required by the game's story to reunite with Edgar and Setzer, who leads them to the Falcon, an airship that belonged to a deceased friend; however, in a series of mostly optional side-quests, the player has the opportunity to gather the entire group, all still alive, as well as new allies Umaro and Gogo. Together, this quantity of Returners launch a new offensive against Kefka's Tower. Inside, the Returners battle their way through Kefka's defenses and destroy the three statues, the source of Kefka's newfound power. When destroying the statues, once the source of all magic, does not cause any noticeable reaction, the party realizes that Kefka has successfully drained the Warring Triad of power and has become the source of all magical power.|$|E
40|$|<b>Punctuated</b> {{equilibrium}} {{theory in}} public policy replicated from biological <b>punctuated</b> equilibrium theory has concluded that public policies alternate between stasis and punctuation. However, recent research on Pacific Northwest forest policy, U. S. state tobacco policy, and U. S federal auto efficiency policy have found no punctuations despite an attempt to do so. What is the efficacy of using biological <b>punctuated</b> equilibrium theory to also explain <b>punctuated</b> equilibrium {{in public policy}}? Significant differences exist between biological and public policy <b>punctuated</b> equilibrium theory including time frames for change, what constitutes outside disturbances of equilibrium, venues of <b>punctuated</b> equilibrium, levels of analysis for change, and patterns of change. Most policy research on punctuation {{has focused on the}} "tone" of media coverage related to change.

The primary difference appears to be that pre-light cultures have more broken-up sleep patterns.

Valenzuela shut out the Houston Astros 2–0. He started the season 8–0 with five shutouts and an ERA of 0.50. <b>Punctuating</b> this dominance on the mound, Valenzuela had an unusual, flamboyant wind-up (looking skyward just at the apex of every pitch), which drew attention of its own. It was a habit which he claims to have developed spontaneously, although not until joining the Dodgers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Punctuated</b> {{equilibrium}} {{in social}} theory {{is a method}} of understanding change in complex social systems. The method studies the evolution of policy change, including the evolution of conflicts.

The theory was largely inspired from the biological theory of <b>punctuated</b> equilibrium developed by paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould.|$|R

25|$|Linguistic {{commentators}} {{have noted the}} multi-faceted approach of the Egyptian revolutionaries towards the Arabic language. Whereas Egypt's first President Muhammad Naguib exhibited a preference for using Standard Arabic in his public speeches, his successor Gamal Abdel Nasser was renowned for using the vernacular, and <b>punctuating</b> his speeches with traditional Egyptian words, and expressions. Conversely, Standard Arabic was the norm for state news outlets, including newspapers, magazines, television, and radio. This was especially true of Egypt's national broadcasting company, the Arab Radio and Television Union, which was established {{with the intent of}} providing content for the entire Arab World, not merely Egypt, hence the need to broadcast in the standard rather than vernacular. The Voice of the Arabs radio station in particular had an audience from across the region, and the use of anything other than Standard Arabic was viewed as eminently incongruous.|$|E
40|$|According to the <b>punctuated</b> {{equilibrium}} thesis, government attention allocation alternates between {{long periods}} of stasis and dramatic spurts of disequilibrium because democratic institutions enable minority groups to obstruct change. This article presents a critical discrepancy in contemporary China, where <b>punctuated</b> instability is significantly more intense {{despite a lack of}} democratic institutions to empower minority obstructionism. Our empirical analysis further reveals that <b>punctuated</b> intensity goes even higher for Chinese regions facing fewer signs of social discontent. We attribute the intensification of <b>punctuated</b> dynamics to an information disadvantage arising from the lack of diverse, independent sources of information under authoritarianism. Our finding contributes to <b>punctuated</b> equilibrium theory by underlining the function of opposition groups not only as obstructionists but also as challengers to policy priorities. By marginalizing these challengers, authoritarian institutions confine attention to known problems, leading to serious delays in the discovery of and adjustment to emerging issues...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>punctuated</b> {{equilibrium}} {{model of}} policy change was first presented by Frank Baumgartner and Bryan Jones in 1993, and has increasingly received attention in historical institutionalism. The model states that policy generally changes only incrementally due to several restraints, namely the [...] "stickiness" [...] of institutional cultures, vested interests, and the bounded rationality of individual decision-makers. Policy change will thus be <b>punctuated</b> {{by changes in}} these conditions, especially in party control of government, or changes in public opinion. Thus policy is characterized by long periods of stability, <b>punctuated</b> by large—though less frequent—changes due to large shifts in society or government. This has been particularly evident in current trends of environmental and energy policy. Gun control and U.S. federal tobacco policy have also been found to follow <b>punctuated</b> changes. A recent study by Michael Givel found that despite a significant mobilization to change state tobacco policy, U.S. state tobacco policymaking from 1990 to 2003 was not characterized by <b>punctuated</b> policy change, which also favored the pro-tobacco policy agenda.|$|R
