5|$|At Massive Dynamic, Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes to {{the team}} that Observers are time travelers, {{as they have been}} {{documented}} during several major events in history. They write in an incomprehensible language, and the number of Observer sightings has increased over the <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> leaving the team wondering why. Meanwhile, August visits the other Observers, who are not happy that he saved a girl who was supposed to die in the plane crash. To correct his mistake, they send Donald Long (Paul Rae), an assassin affiliated with the Observers to correct August's actions. In an attempt to save Christine, August sends a secret message to Walter. During the meeting, August reveals Christine will die because she is not important; Walter tells August that he has to make her important.|$|E
5|$|Betty {{has gained}} weight over the <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> causing her self-worth to drop and her sex life with Henry to flatline. This prompts an {{intervention}} of sorts from Henry's mother, Pauline, who suggests diet pills. When Betty {{goes to the}} doctor's office {{in an attempt to}} obtain diet pills, the doctor refuses. After a routine examination, he finds a possibly cancerous lump in Betty's throat. Betty returns home in a hysteric fever. She calls Don, who reassures her. Betty begins to confront the legacy of her life and the effect her death would have on her loved ones. Several days later, the doctor calls back to tell her the tumor is benign. Henry holds a despondent Betty in his arms. She ponders her life as simply a sad, fat housewife.|$|E

40|$|Retrospective {{subjective}} well-being (SWB) {{refers to}} self-reported satisfaction and emotional experience over the <b>past</b> <b>few</b> weeks or <b>months.</b> Two studies investigated the mechanisms linking daily experiences to retrospective SWB. Participants reported events {{each day for}} 21 days (Study 1) {{or twice a week}} for two months (Study 2). The emotional intensity of each event was rated: (1) when it had recently occurred (proximal intensity); and (2) {{at the end of the}} event-reporting period (distal intensity). Both sets of ratings were then aggregated across events and used to predict retrospective SWB at the end of the study. Path analyses showed that proximal intensity predicted retrospective SWB whereas distal intensity did not. The effect remained even after controlling for trait happiness and neuroticism. These results suggest that daily experiences influence retrospective SWB primarily through abstract representations of the <b>past</b> <b>few</b> weeks or <b>months</b> (as measured by aggregated proximal intensity ratings) rather than the explicit recollection of individual events during the same period (as measured by aggregated distal intensity ratings). Retrospective SWB, in turn, mediated the effect of daily experiences on global SWB (i. e., self-reported satisfaction and emotional experiences in general) ...|$|R

30|$|These {{potential}} {{interactions of}} cultural and biophysical factors allow us to reconsider further the hypothesis of ignition limitation. In many historic landscapes, human habitation areas and movement corridors were nearly saturated with human ignitions (Lewis 1980, Drobyshev et al. 2004, Granström and Niklasson 2008), with small, low intensity fires predominating in these areas during the marginal burning conditions (Pyne 1995, 2007) that occurred in most years, {{and particularly in the}} early and late fire season (Table 1). During drought years, these fires grew and amalgamated with lightning ignitions that predominated in areas lightly used by humans (Bridge et al. 2005). Ultimately, with ignition relatively common, the amount of burn area was determined by the frequency of weather periods favorable for fire growth, and the temporal pattern of fuel recovery in areas burned in periods immediately <b>past</b> (e.g., a <b>few</b> <b>months</b> to a <b>few</b> years prior to re-ignition). These interacting spatial and temporal processes of ignition limitation require further research (Krawchuk et al. 2009).|$|R

To pass the time, bandleader Ivan Doroschuk began jamming with Voivod drummer Michel Langevin and Doughboys member John Kastner and listening to Bleach by Nirvana, which would shape the sound of the album. According to Doroschuk, he was tired of being pressured by his record label to come up with another [...] "Safety Dance", and instead wanted to take the album in a very different direction than anything the band had done in the <b>past.</b> A <b>few</b> <b>months</b> later, Stefan rejoined the band, this time switching to bass, and the new band began to tour. On 24 December 1990, Men Without Hats shared the stage with Mitsou at Les Foufounes Electriques in Montreal, performing many of their hits, rearranged in their new hard rock style, and most of the tracks that would become Sideways. The band eschewed the use of either of their logos (the crossed out man wearing a hat and the heart with the number 21 in it) for this release, instead opting to use a simple font (MENWITHOUTHATS). They also decided to abandon the left-wing politics that had defined Pop Goes the World and In the 21st Century, instead writing simple non-political songs about life.|$|R

The formal report of his presentation shows that his work ignores rather than contradicts earlier studies. For example, he experimented only with artificial wormholes, and did not follow up the observation made at the 1966 Conference, that live bookworms were a known tool of the fake antiquities trade. Similarly, he claimed that the anatase in the ink could have come from sand used to dry it (the hypothetical source of the sand being gneiss from the Binnenthal area of Switzerland) but his team had not examined the crystals microscopically, and Kenneth Towe responded that this was an essential test, given that crystal size and shape should clearly distinguish commercial anatase from anatase found in sand.|$|R

500|$|... "Higher Ground" [...] became {{another song}} {{that helped the}} band achieve {{international}} success. Originally written and recorded in 1973 by R singer Stevie Wonder, the track was, according to Flea, a perfect cover for the band: [...] " [...] the lyrics are great. Especially {{as far as the}} situation that the band has been in, as far as state of mind, for the <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>months.</b> That song is really about raising and uplifting yourself spiritually." [...] The bassist affirmed that the reason the band covered the song was to pay homage to Wonder and the important role he played in popular music. The cover begins with a funk bass-line, followed by multi-layered heavy metal guitar progressions and effects-treated vocals. [...] "Higher Ground"'s chorus features backing vocals from an array of friends and engineers who worked on the record; the individuals' competence in singing was irrelevant to the band because they sought to achieve a sense of unity. Mother's Milk was composed of a variety of songs that expanded the Chili Peppers' repertoire. The instrumental [...] "Pretty Little Ditty" [...] {{was one of the few}} songs that featured no guitar layering; Apter notes that the song is [...] "a dreamy, sweetly stoned instrumental featured deft picking and strumming from Frusciante, intertwined with blasts of trumpet from Flea." [...] The eclectic track was originally intended to be over three minutes long, but was cut to just under 2 minutes before the album's release. [...] "Taste the Pain" [...] reflects a more meditative and melodic theme, similar to [...] "Knock Me Down". Frusciante introduces psychedelic guitar progressions in the verse, while the lyrics touch on themes of love and loss. Other tracks such as [...] "Stone Cold Bush" [...] presented topics of prostitution while [...] "Punk Rock Classic" [...] was, in retrospect, an emulation of typical punk rock songs by Black Flag and The Germs—bands that were influential to the Chili Peppers.|$|E

40|$|The {{supply of}} {{drinking}} water is a crucial and vulnerable element of the Swedish infrastructure. In the <b>past</b> <b>few</b> years it has suffered several crises due to contamination and waterborne diseases. Therefore, management of water crisis has become a highly topical issue for the country's municipalities, particularly after two recent outbreaks of cryptosporidium. This protozoan parasite is often spread through contaminated water and causes a parasitic disease that affects the intestines and typically causes an acute short-term infection. The largest known outbreak of cryptosporidium in drinking water occurred in 1993 in Milwaukee, US, where more than 400 000 people were infected. In Sweden, two large outbreaks have occurred during the <b>past</b> <b>few</b> years. The drinking water in Östersund, a mid-sized city with around 59 000 inhabitants, was infected with cryptosporidium in November 2010.
