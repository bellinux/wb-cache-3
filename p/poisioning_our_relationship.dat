We {{focused on the}} inward turn of consciousness, or the movement from the great gods of Olympus authorizing actions through supra-human forces informing character, to conflicting psychic drives that condition human lives and motivate actions. We looked at the backgrounds of all three playwrights, analyzed each play, and ultimately concluded that Greek Tragedy is still important today. Greek Tragedy remains profoundly relevant today because it tries to explain ourselves, <b>our</b> <b>relationship</b> to others, <b>our</b> <b>relationship</b> to the world, and <b>our</b> <b>relationship</b> to the divine.
