50|$|A {{stationary}} state is called stationary {{because the system}} remains in the same state as time elapses, in every observable way. For a single-particle Hamiltonian, {{this means that the}} particle has a constant probability distribution for its position, its velocity, its spin, etc. (This is true assuming the <b>particle's</b> <b>environment</b> is also static, i.e. the Hamiltonian is unchanging in time.) The wavefunction itself is not stationary: It continually changes its overall complex phase factor, so as to form a standing wave. The oscillation frequency of the standing wave, times Planck's constant, is the energy of the state according to the Planck-Einstein relation.|$|R

50|$|In space, {{high energy}} {{ionizing}} particles exist {{as part of}} the natural background, referred to as galactic cosmic rays (GCR). Solar particle events and high energy protons trapped in the Earth's magnetosphere (Van Allen radiation belts) exacerbate this problem. The high energies associated with the phenomenon in the space <b>particle</b> <b>environment</b> generally render increased spacecraft shielding useless in terms of eliminating SEU and catastrophic single event phenomena (e.g. destructive latch-up). Secondary atmospheric neutrons generated by cosmic rays can also have sufficiently high energy for producing SEUs in electronics on aircraft flights over the poles or at high altitude. Trace amounts of radioactive elements in chip packages also lead to SEUs.|$|E
50|$|On {{the third}} day of the mission, the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) was {{deployed}} from Discovery's payload bay 350 statute miles above Earth to study human effects on the planet's atmosphere and its shielding ozone layer. The UARS mission objectives were to provide an increased understanding of the energy input into the upper atmosphere, global photochemistry of the upper atmosphere, dynamics of the upper atmosphere, the coupling among these processes, and the coupling between the upper and lower atmosphere. This provided data for a coordinated study of the structure, chemistry, energy balance, and physical action of the Earth's middle atmosphere - thatslice of air between 10 and 60 miles above the Earth. The UARS was the first major flight element of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, a multi-year global research program that would use ground-based, airborne, and space-based instruments to study the Earth as a complete environmental system. UARS had ten sensing and measuring devices: Cryogenic Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer (CLAES); Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder (ISAMS); Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS); Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE); High Resolution Doppler Imager (HRDI); Wind Imaging Interferometer (WlNDII); Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM); Solar/Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE); <b>Particle</b> <b>Environment</b> Monitor (PEM) and Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM II).

50|$|Japan's {{planetary}} missions have so {{far been}} limited to the inner Solar System, and emphasis {{has been put on}} magnetospheric and atmospheric research. The Mars explorer Nozomi (PLANET-B), which ISAS launched prior to the merger of the three aerospace institutes, became one of the earliest difficulties the newly formed JAXA faced. Nozomi ultimately passed 1,000 km from the surface of Mars. On 20 May 2010, the Venus Climate Orbiter Akatsuki (PLANET-C) and IKAROS solar sail demonstrator was launched by a H-2A launch vehicle. On 7 December 2010, Akatsuki was unable to complete its Venus orbit insertion maneuver. Akatsuki finally entered Venus orbit in 7 December 2015, making it the first Japanese spacecraft to orbit another planet, sixteen years after the originally planned orbital insertion of Nozomi. One of Akatsuki's main goal is to uncover the mechanism behind Venus atmosphere's super-rotation, a phenomenon in which the cloud top winds in the toposphere circulates around the planet faster than the speed that Venus itself rotates. A thorough explanation for this phenomenon has yet been found. JAXA/ISAS was part of the international Laplace Jupiter mission proposal from its foundation. A Japanese contribution was sought {{in the form of an}} independent orbiter to research Jupiter's magnetosphere, JMO (Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter).

By comparison of structural characteristics of the heap with sediments created on top of inclined planes exploiting the method of Minkowski tensors, we provide further evidence to support this hypothesis. Moreover, for the case of sediments generated by homogeneous rain on surfaces, we provide relationships between the inclination of the surface and the Minkowski measures characterizing the isotropy of local <b>particle</b> <b>environments...</b>|$|R

The largest of these are associated with Global Merged Interaction Regions (GMIR's) which, in turn, block cosmic ray entry into the inner heliosphere and are apparently responsible for triggering the two major episodes of VLF radio emissions now thought to come from the heliopause. Distance estimates to the termination shock are consistent with those determined from observations of anomalous cosmic rays.

However, space environment tools are not generally available to provide assessments of charged <b>particle</b> <b>environment</b> and its variations in the solar wind, magnetosheath, and magnetotail at L 2 distances.

LRAD contains models tied to satellite measurement data of the solar wind and magnetotail regions. The model provides particle flux and fluence calculations necessary to predict spacecraft charging conditions and the degradation of materials used in the construction of NGST.
