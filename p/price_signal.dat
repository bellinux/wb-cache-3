25|$|It is also {{important}} for any carbon credit (offset) to prove a concept called additionality. The concept of additionality addresses {{the question of whether}} the project would have happened in the absence of an intervention in the form of the <b>price</b> <b>signal</b> of carbon credits. Only projects with emissions below their baseline level, defined as emissions under a scenario without this <b>price</b> <b>signal</b> (holding all other factors constant), represent a net environmental benefit. Carbon projects that yield strong financial returns even in the absence of revenue from carbon credits; or that are compelled by regulations; or that represent common practice in an industry; are usually not considered additional. A full determination of additionality requires a careful investigation of proposed carbon offset projects.|$|E
500|$|Rod Oram commented in a Sunday Star Times {{column that}} the National Government's {{changes to the}} ETS were [...] "a giant step backwards" [...] which would [...] "drive up emissions, {{perpetuate}} old technology, necessitate ever-greater subsidies and reduce New Zealand's international competitiveness and reputation." [...] Oram considered that the amendments to the NZ ETS destroyed its effectiveness. His examples were: removing limits on emissions by adopting intensity-based allocation of free carbon credits, slavishly following climate-laggard Australia, minimising the price incentive by extending the free allocation of credits for 75 years, muting the <b>price</b> <b>signal</b> with a $NZ25 per tonne of carbon cap, forcing forestry holders of credits to sell them overseas because of the $NZ25 per tonne cap, cancelling complementary measures such as fuel efficiency standards, giving in to special pleading via subsidies, and creating uncertainty for business.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of <b>price</b> <b>signaling</b> {{activity}} and underlying propensities to cooperate on tacit collusion in posted offer markets. The primary experiment consists of an extensively repeated baseline sequence and a 'forecast' sequence that adds to the baseline a forecasting game that allows identification of signaling intentions. Forecast sequence results indicate that signaling intentions considerably exceed those that are counted under a standard signal measure based on previous period prices. Nevertheless, we find essentially no correlation between either measure of signal volumes and collusive efficiency. A second experiment demonstrates that underlying seller propensities to cooperate more clearly affect collusiveness.

2500|$|Tiered {{water rate}} {{structures}} generally don’t place {{a cap on}} the amount of water a parcel may use. [...] Rather, tiered rates make the cost of using water more expensive as a <b>price</b> <b>signal</b> to encourage water conservation. [...] This means that a parcel may generally use as much water as desired as long as the water customer pays the higher price. [...] Thus, tiered rates also function as a revenue raising device (a tax) to the extent the rates exceed the cost of providing the service to the parcel. [...] Property-related charges that exceed the cost of service were precisely the type of abuse by local governments that Proposition 218 was intended to no longer permit.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method to}} generate statistical models of electricity demand from Commercial and Industrial (C&I) facilities including their response to dynamic <b>pricing</b> <b>signals.</b> Models are built with historical electricity demand data.

Three regression-based baseline computation methods were developed and analyzed. All methods performed similarly. To understand the diversity of facility responses to dynamic <b>pricing</b> <b>signals,</b> we have characterized the response of 44 C&I facilities participating in a Demand Response (DR) program using dynamic pricing in California (Pacific Gas and Electric's Critical Peak Pricing Program). In most cases, facilities shed load during DR events but there is significant heterogeneity in facility responses.

During the last years, a lot of technologies and optimization methodologies were developed to increase the efficiency, maintain the grid stability and support large scale introduction of renewable sources.
