40|$|In {{terahertz}} {{time domain}} spectroscopy (THz-TDS) material <b>parameter</b> <b>extraction</b> {{is necessary for}} determining the complex refractive index of materials in the THz region. The process of material <b>parameter</b> <b>extraction</b> requires the fitting of a theoretical model for the propagation the THz pulse through the material to experimentally acquired THz time domain data, where by the complex refractive index of the theoretical model is varied until it fits the experimental data. It requires close agreement between {{a model of the}} THz electric field propagation and experimental THz data for accurate extraction of the complex refractive index. In this thesis I report on the methods of material <b>parameter</b> <b>extraction</b> with the goal of accurately determining the complex refractive index of materials within the THz region. I also investigate a series of optimisation techniques from understanding the behaviour of the extracted complex refractive index for different model assumptions and initial parameters.
