5|$|While Marlborough {{achieved}} honours on the battlefield, the Whigs, {{now in the}} ascendancy, {{drove the}} remaining Tories from the Cabinet. Marlborough and Godolphin, now distanced from Anne, would henceforth have {{to conform to the}} decisions of a Whig ministry, while the Tories, sullen and vengeful, looked forward to their former leaders' downfall. To compound his troubles, the Duchess, spurred on by her hatred of Harley and Abigail, had finally driven the Queen to distraction and wrecked what was left of their friendship. Sarah was retained in her court position out of necessity as the <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paid to keep her victorious husband {{at the head of the}} army.|$|E
5|$|Ged is {{depicted}} as proud and yet unsure of himself in multiple situations: early in his apprenticeship he believes Ogion to be mocking him, and later, at Roke, feels put upon by Jasper. In both cases, he believes that others do not appreciate his greatness, and Le Guin's sympathetic narration does not immediately contradict this belief. Cadden writes that Le Guin allows young readers to sympathize with Ged, and only gradually {{realize that there is}} a <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paid for his actions, as he learns to discipline his magical powers. Similarly, as Ged begins his apprenticeship with Ogion, he imagines that he will be taught mysterious aspects of wizardry, and has visions of transforming himself into other creatures, but gradually comes to see that Ogion's important lessons are those about his own self.|$|E

Gleizes replied that he preferred to buy it himself and therefore wanted the <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as low as possible.|$|E

25|$|Seal skins {{have been}} used by {{aboriginal}} people for millennia to make waterproof jackets and boots, and seal fur to make fur coats. Pelts account for over half the processed value of a seal, selling at over C$100 each as of 2006. According to Paul Christian Rieber, of GC Rieber AS, the difficult ice conditions and low quotas in 2006 resulted in less access to seal pelts, which caused the commodity <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pushed up. One high-end fashion designer, Donatella Versace, has begun to use seal pelts, while others, such as Calvin Klein, Stella McCartney, Tommy Hilfiger, and Ralph Lauren, refrain from using any kind of fur.|$|E

Beyond this I look to the forethought not yet so widely diffused in this country as in Scotland, & in some foreign lands; & I need not remind you that in order to facilitate its exercise the Government have been empowered by Legislation to become through the Dept. of the P.O. the receivers & guardians of savings.|$|E
25|$|On 2 July 2009, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev {{said that}} the refit of the carrier should be {{completed}} {{as soon as possible}} so she could be delivered to India in 2012. On 7 December 2009, Russian sources indicated that final terms had been agreed on, but no delivery date was set. On 8 December 2009, it was reported that India and Russia ended the stalemate over Admiral Gorshkov price deal by agreeing on a price of US$2.2 billion. Moscow was asking for US$2.9 billion for the aircraft carrier, nearly three times the price that was originally agreed between the two sides in 2004. On the other hand, New Delhi wanted the <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> scaled back to US$2.1 billion. Both governments finalised the price of Admiral Gorshkov at US$2.35 billion on 10 March, a day ahead of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's two-day visit to India.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{condemnation}} proceeded {{against other}} property {{owners in the}} area. At this time, the eminent domain procedures governing the District of Columbia required the city to condemn land, and for the landowner to fight the condemnation in court before a jury. The jury then determined if the condemnation was required, and what compensation should be awarded the property owner. In two separate proceedings, juries found land to be worth just 1 cent per square foot. Senator James McMillan (R-Michigan), chair of the Senate District of Columbia Committee, brought S.2637 {{to the floor of}} the Senate on June 24. McMillan argued that the cemetery trustees were not opposed to the road, just to the <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paid for the condemned land. Senator George Graham Vest (D-Missouri) asked that the bill be temporarily tabled, and it was. On July 14, Senator Matt Whitaker Ransom (D-North Carolina) presented the Senate with a petition from 1,000 cemetery lotholders opposed to the Senate and House bills. (PHC director George Wagner later characterized the dispute over lotholder support as one Senator lying to another.) The objections raised by Vest and other senators were seemingly resolved by July 24, when McMillan again called the bill for a vote on the Senate floor. One change to the bill had been made, providing for federally-financed construction of a retaining wall on cemetery property if one was needed. But once more the bill was put on hold. Senator David Turpie (D-Indiana) objected to the bill overall, and Senator Francis Cockrell (D-Missouri) wanted a cap put on the price of the compensation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{departs from}} the {{standard}} profit-maximizing model of firm behavior by assuming that firms are motivated in part by personal animosity-or respect-towards their competitors. A reciprocal firm responds to unkind behavior of rivals with unkind actions (negative reciprocity), {{while at the same}} time, it responds to kind behavior of rivals with kind actions (positive reciprocity). We find that collusion <b>is</b> easier <b>to</b> sustain when firms have a concern for reciprocity towards competing firms provided that they consider collusive <b>prices</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> kind and punishment <b>prices</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unkind. Thus, reciprocity concerns among firms can have adverse welfare consequences for consumers...|$|R

Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] grade, explaining that [...] "the trick here is how perfectly Thompson and Hanks portray the gradual thaw in their characters' frosty alliance, empathizing with each other's equally miserable upbringings in a beautiful three-hankie scene late in the film." [...] Kenneth Turan of Los Angeles Times wrote that the film [...] "does not strictly hew to the historical record where the eventual resolution of this conflict is concerned," [...] but admitted that it [...] "is easy to accept this fictionalizing {{as part of the}} <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paid for Thompson's engaging performance." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} {{primarily}} criticized for its short length.

However, others compared Braids short experience to similar criticisms with Portal in that its length [...] "can be disregarded {{in the face of}} its unique approach to storytelling and expansive ideas". The game's price was also seen as a negative for the game, though McShea wrote that [...] "Braid is worth every penny". Blow later said that he expected the <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> , but Microsoft, in promoting the game as part of its Summer of Arcade, made the price $15. Edge also noted that while Blow had tried to integrate the story and gameplay throughout the game, this only worked well in the final world, and otherwise the story was [...] "a little trite in its self-conscious obscurity". However, others—including new media academics—have disagreed, praising the philosophical complexity of the game, saying [...] "Jonathan Blow's Braid is the sort of ontological labyrinth that Jorge Luis Borges might have made.

500|$|Belgrano {{maintained}} frequent {{discussions with}} the committee members of the Consulate, who were all merchants with strong interests involved in the monopolic commerce with Cadiz. He made many proposals, influenced by free trade ideas. By this time, Belgrano thought that [...] "The merchant must have freedom to buy where he can be best accommodated, and it's natural that he does where {{he is supplied with}} the best <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to earn the best profit". Those proposals were rejected by the committee members; his only supporters were Juan José Castelli, Juan Larrea, and Domingo Matheu. However, Belgrano had some successes, such as creating the Nautical School, the Commerce School, and the Geometry and Drawing Academy. He created the Commerce School to influence future merchants to work towards {{the best interests of the}} nation, and the nautical and drawing ones to provide the youth with prestigious and lucrative careers. The schools were situated next to the Consulate so that Belgrano could easily supervise their development. The schools were in place for three years before they were closed by a ruling of Manuel Godoy, from the Spanish monarchy, who considered them an unnecessary luxury for a colony. It was felt that Buenos Aires might not be able to maintain them.|$|E
