Therefore, the objective of this research was to determine the effect of a ripening retardant and ethylene application on the conservation and quality of pitahaya fruits and the possible changes during ripening associated with ethylene, for which a completely randomized design with three treatments was used, corresponding to the application of ethylene (ethephon, 3 mL L- 1), 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP, 600 mg L- 1) and a control, with four replications, for a total of 12 experimental units. The fruits were stored at 18 °C with 75 % relative humidity. The 1 -MCP application significantly decreased the loss of firmness, total soluble solids, loss of fresh mass and respiratory rate. Fruits from the control and ethylene treatment tended toward a climateric respiratory behavior. The total carotenoid content of the fruits was significantly higher in the ethylene application and the control treatment, which was consistent with the color change of the fruits. It can be concluded that the 1 -MCP application reduced the ethylene action, slowing the ripening of the <b>dragon</b> <b>fruits...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Reddish-orange spots with {{chlorotic}} halos {{were detected}} in stems and fruits of yellow pitahaya (Hylocereus megalanthus) in Botucatu region, Brazil, and Colletotrichum gloeosporioideswas {{identified as the}} causal agent. This is the first Brazilian report on Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc leading to anthracnose in pitahaya plants. The genus Hylocereus belongs to the family Cactaceae and comprises ~ 12 species. Along with the genus Selenicereus, which has eight species, it produces edible fruits known as <b>pitahaya,</b> pitaya or <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> (Bauer 2003). The species Hylocereus megalanthus (K. Schumann ex Vaupel) Ralf Bauer (2003) is endemic {{to the north of}} South America (Nerd and Mizrahi 2002) and produces yellow pitahaya, one of the varieties most appreciated by consumers. The production of these fruits is restricted to small crop areas (Le Bellec et al. 2006). In Brazil, there are small areas of production of yellow pitahaya, located mainly in the State of São Paulo. However, due to higher consumption of exotic fruit and its commercial value, interest in the planting and cultivation of this fruit is increasing. In this region, fruit production occurs from December to May, with average annual productivity o...|$|R

40|$|<b>Dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> (Hylocereus spp.), {{also known}} as pitaya or pitahaya, is {{increasingly}} gaining interest in many countries, including Thailand which is {{a country with a}} climate ideal for breeding different varieties of tropical and subtropical fruits in general, and <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> more specifically. The benefits of <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> for human health can be explained by its essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, complex carbohydrates, dietary fibres and antioxidants. <b>Dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> is also an essential source of betacyanin which serves as a red/purple pigment with antioxidative properties. In Thailand, most of the fresh <b>dragon</b> <b>fruits</b> are consumed domestically, while some are traded globally as fresh fruit and processed products as juice or puree. As it is, <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> peel and seeds are often considered as waste or by-products from fruit processing and have been less successful at adding value to the fruit. Currently, there is limited literature on <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> properties, its processed products and constituents as well as potential utilization. Therefore, the main objective of this doctoral research was to gain deeper insight in the characteristics of <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> and its derived products and components, specifically of two species of <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit,</b> i. e. white-flesh <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> (H. undatus) and red-flesh <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> (H. polyrhizus). The characteristics of these two species of <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> and their possible application are extensively discussed in the doctoral thesis/research. Chapter 1 provides a state-of-the-art of current and relevant research on <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> with respect to botanical classification, cultivation, economic aspects and chemical composition (particularly nutrients, pigment and antioxidative components) as well as an overview of techniques to process fruits (processing), i. e. freeze-drying and thermal processing. The impact of these processes on quality attributes (e. g. physicochemical and rheological properties) of different fruits is critically reviewed. The review also aims at giving a summarized overview of the most important aspects of seed oil (e. g. chemical composition and lipid oxidation) and cell wall polysaccharides (e. g. structure of pectic and hemicellulosic substances). In Chapter 2, the properties/characteristics of the whole fruit, peel, pulp (seed-free flesh) and puree (flesh containing seeds) of the two species of <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> were performed. Results demonstrated that the peel of both <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> species as well as the pulp and puree of the red-flesh species contained large amounts of betacyanin. As it is, they have the potential to be utilized as a natural colouring agent. <b>Dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> pulp and puree also exhibited significant antioxidative activities. This was even more pronounced for the red-flesh species due to the presence of betacyanin. The pulp and puree showed shear-thinning behaviour due to the presence of mucilaginous components. Throughout this doctoral research, these characteristics of <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit,</b> for example, pigment, antioxidative activities and rheological properties, provide a deeper insight with regard to further valorization of the fruit components and optimization of the fruit processing. Chapter 3 describes the characterization of the freeze-dried pulp and peel of the two species of <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> to be further utilized of <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit’s</b> pigment (betacyanin) as a food additive. It was found that freeze-drying could satisfactorily preserve colour and pigment concentration. The freeze-dried red-flesh pulp and the freeze-dried <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> peel from both species contained high contents of betacyanin. The freeze-dried <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> pulp was well-soluble in water, whereas {{this was not the case}} for the freeze-dried <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> peel. Additionally, due to the pH-sensitivity of betacyanin, the influence of pH (1 - 11) on the colour shift of the freeze-dried <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> peel and pulp was monitored. The colour of the freeze-dried peel was stable within a pH range of 3 - 7, whereas the freeze-dried red-flesh pulp had high colour stability over a pH range of 1 - 11 and is available in a convenient form making it suitable for the use as a food colourant. In order to gain insight into the effects of thermal treatment on the characteristics of the white-flesh and red-flesh <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> purees, the antioxidative, rheological, physicochemical and microbiological properties of the purees were investigated at different process conditions (between 50 and 90 °C for 60 min). The results are presented and discussed in Chapter 4. It is interesting to see that the antioxidative properties of the heated <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> puree increased during heating treatment probably because of the superior antioxidative attributes of the <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> seeds present in the puree and the formation of Maillard reaction products. During thermal processing, the L* value (lightness) and b* value (yellowness) of the processed <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> puree can be used to control the quality online. Total colour change (TCC), which is an indicator of different colour between the unheated and heated puree samples, of the red-flesh <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> puree showed a strong negative correlation with betacyanin content. The kinetics of colour changes and betacyanin degradation in the heated <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> puree followed a second-order models. The apparent viscosity of the heated <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> puree increased with heating time and temperature. The rheological data fitted very well with the power-law model, showing shear-thinning behaviour. Thus, the heated <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> puree, particularly the red-flesh puree, offer possibilities to be applied in foodstuffs due to their interesting attributes after thermal treatment. The <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> seeds are considered to have a high antioxidative potential. As it is, oil was extracted from the white-flesh and red-flesh <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> seeds with petroleum ether as cold extraction. The characterization of the seed oil is described in Chapter 5. <b>Dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> seeds contained significant amounts of oil, which accounted for about 32 - 34 % of the dried seed weight. The predominant fatty acids of both <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> seed oils were linoleic acid (C 18 : 2, 45 - 55 %), oleic acid (C 18 : 1, 19 - 24 %), palmitic acid (C 16 : 0, 15 - 18 %) and stearic acid (C 18 : 0, 7 - 8 %), respectively. <b>Dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> seed oil is interesting from a nutritional point of view as it contains a high amount of essential fatty acids, amounting to 56 %. The triacylglycerol (TAG) composition in the seed oil was also analyzed. It was shown to contain mainly triunsaturated and diunsaturated TAGs. A significant amount of tocopherols in the <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> seed oil was clearly observed in which α-tocopherol was the most abundant tocopherol in the oil (72 % of total tocopherol content). In addition, a storage assessment of 3 months was performed, monitoring the oxidative and tocopherol stabilities in the <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> seed oil. A low oxidation rate of both <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> seed oils was obtained, while tocopherol content decreased on storage. However, the concentration of tocopherols in the <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> seed oil after 12 weeks remained high content compared to the initial state. Thus, the <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> seed oil could be considered as a good source of essential fatty acids and tocopherols, with a high oxidative stability. In Chapter 6, the activity of pectic enzymes, i. e. pectin methylesterase (PME) and polygalacturonase (PG), of the pulp and peel of white-flesh and red-flesh <b>dragon</b> <b>fruits</b> as well as inactivation of pectic enzymes by thermal treatments (30 - 90 °C for 10 min) were examined. The untreated white-flesh <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> had a higher PME activity compared to the red-flesh <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit,</b> whereas PG activity was absent in all <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> samples. Results also demonstrated that no significant effects of PME activity at temperature below 70 °C for 10 min in either the pulp or the peel of <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> were observed, while a moderate heat treatment (80 and 90 °C for 10 min) could efficiently inactivate PME. In the last part of this doctoral study, the polysaccharides (pectic and hemicellulosic substances) from cell wall materials of the pulp and peel of white-flesh and red-flesh <b>dragon</b> <b>fruits</b> were isolated and structurally compared, as described in Chapter 7. Prior to cell wall polysaccharide isolation, blanching at 80 °C for 10 min allowed PME inactivation. Subsequently, cell wall material was extracted and sequentially fractionated using various solutions to obtain three different pectic fractions, a hemicellulosic fraction and a remaining residue fraction which could not be solubilized by the procedure used. These polysaccharide fractions were chemically characterized in terms of galacturonic acid (GalA) content, degree of methoxylation (DM), neutral sugar composition, molar mass distribution and affinity towards some specific anti-pectin antibodies. Results showed that the cell wall polysaccharides in the pulp and, to an even greater extent, in the peel of both white-flesh and red-flesh species contained significant amounts of pectic substances. The pectic substances in the <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> peel as well as in the <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> pulp were shown to be lowly methyl-esterified pectin (DM < 39 %) and highly water-soluble pectin (38 - 47 %). A higher contribution of pectic homogalacturonan (HG) region in the peel samples was observed compared to the pulp samples, whereas there were no large differences between the pectic substances of both <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> species. Despite the low average DM value of the pulp and peel pectins, pectic substances in both pulp and peel samples showed an affinity for anti-HG antibodies with different specificities, indicating that a wide range of epitopes (including long blocks of unesterified GalA residues as well as a few consecutive esterified GalA residues) was present. In this doctoral research, the key findings of the experimental work are clearly shown and summarized in Chapter 8. <b>Dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> is an excellent source of bioactive compounds such as betacyanin and tocopherol which both have high antioxidative properties and health-promoting functions. <b>Dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> also provides many valuable products and components that could have high potential of being applied in food industry. For example, the freeze-dried <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> pulp could be used as a red/purple colouring agent (betacyanin) as well as an instant juice powder. The heated <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> puree with significant antioxidative activity could serve as a semi-processed product, the <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> seed oil, on the other hand, was defined as a high-value oil. The extracted cell wall polysaccharide from <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> peel demonstrated to be a low methyl-esterified pectin. Thus, the dissemination of the research findings may significantly increase the value of <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit,</b> resulting in an increased revenue for growers and producers...|$|R

For nutritional point of view, the retention of vitamin C counts up to 71. 13 % after freeze-drying. The water solubility of freeze-dried pulp was significantly different compared to the peel (p< 0. 05), that was about 7 times higher than that of the peel. Freeze-dried pulp and peel of red-flesh <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit</b> were a potential source of betacyanins content that found up to 360. 14 mg/ 100 g. All freeze-dried <b>dragon</b> <b>fruits</b> obtained low glass transition temperature, varied between - 6. 70 and 4. 83 °C.
