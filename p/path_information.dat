50|$|Determining source route {{requires}} accumulating {{the address}} of each device between the source and destination during route discovery. The accumulated <b>path</b> <b>information</b> is cached by nodes processing the route discovery packets. The learned paths are used to route packets. To accomplish source routing, the routed packets contain {{the address of}} each device the packet will traverse. This may result in high overhead for long paths or large addresses, like IPv6. To avoid using source routing, DSR optionally defines a flow id option that allows packets to be forwarded on a hop-by-hop basis.|$|E

As the number of interconnection paths and number of input/output of connecting switches in a network increases, the performance measurement becomes more complicated.

We model the similarity between different <b>paths</b> which deliver <b>information</b> about the same event and the similarity between two information items about the same event which are delivered through different paths. Both <b>path</b> and <b>information</b> similarity factors are considered in determining the trust of the information.

Detailed analysis of the proposed approach is presented along with simulation results for validation. I...|$|R
