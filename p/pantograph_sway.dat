40|$|Abstract The static {{crosswind}} displacements of a {{high speed}} pantograph and contact wire are studied. The aim is to assess the overall <b>pantograph</b> <b>sway</b> in crosswinds based on the relative movements of the pantograph and contact wire, {{taking into account the}} crosswind deflection of the train body. The pantograph and wire deflections are derived from simplified models of such structures, whereas train body displacements are computed via Vampire. A spectral approach is used to simulate the turbulent crosswind, which is then used with aerodynamic admittance function to obtain unsteady crosswind loading. Analysis of data shows negligible crosswind deflections of the pantograph itself in the range of few millimeters, but train body and wire deflections are much larger. It is shown that crosswinds may cause the <b>pantograph</b> <b>sway</b> to exceed prescribed limits for some combinations of wind gust and track conditions. ...|$|E
