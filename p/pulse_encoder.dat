No restrictions {{on the number of}} levels of a digital switched-mode power amplifier (SMPA) driving input, nor the pulse encoding scheme employed, are made.

40|$|Due to the {{prevalence}} of pulse encoders for system state information, an all-digital proportional-integral-derivative (ADPID) is proposed {{as an alternative to}} traditional analog and digital PID controllers. The basic concept of an ADPID stems from the use of pulse-width-modulation (PWM) control signals for continuous-time dynamical systems, in that the controller’s proportional, integral and derivative actions are converted into pulses by means of standard up-down digital counters and other digital logic devices. An ADPID eliminates the need for analog-digital and digital-analog conversion, which can be costly and may introduce error and delay into the system. In the proposed ADPID, the unaltered output from a <b>pulse</b> <b>encoder</b> attached to the system’s output can be interpreted directly. After defining a pulse train to represent the desired output of the encoder, an error signal is formed then processed by the ADPID. The resulting ADPID output or control signal is in PWM format, and can be fed directly into the target system without digital-to-analog conversion. In addition to proposing an architecture for the ADPID, rules are presented to enable control engineers to desig...|$|E

40|$|The {{vector control}} study of an {{induction}} motor countenances the decoupled analysis. In this control torque and flux components are independently controlled (just as in dc motor). This simplifies the analysis {{compared to the}} per phase equivalent circuit. The major disadvantage of flux vector control is the required insertion of the <b>pulse</b> <b>encoder.</b> The other disadvantage is that torque is indirectly controlled rather than directly. Lastly, a delay in signal of input references and resultant stator voltage vector is introduced because of presence of the PWM modulator. The last two factors prevent the eventual capability of vector control to attain high express flux and torque control. Direct torque control (DTC) of an induction motor fed by a voltage source inverter is a modest scheme that does not need lengthy computation time and can be implemented without pulse encoders and is unresponsive to parameter variations. The objective is to control efficiently torque and flux. This procedure estimates motor flux and torque by sampling and analyzing motor terminal voltages and currents. A voltage vector is nominated to have flux and torque errors within boundaries, built on estimations of flux position and amount of instantaneous errors in torque and stator flux. This method made the motor control more accurate and fast, highly dynamic speed response and simple to control. The reference value can be evaluated using the flux and torque estimated and motor parameters. The effectiveness of the Direct Torque Control scheme was verified by simulation using MATLAB/SIMULINK®...|$|E
40|$|Helical gears {{are widely}} used in {{gearboxes}} due to its low noise and high load carrying capacity, {{but it is difficult}} to diagnose their early faults based on the signals produced by condition monitoring systems, particularly when the gears rotate at low speed. In this paper, a new concept of Root Mean Square (RMS) value calculation using angle domain signals within small angular ranges is proposed. With this concept, a new diagnosis algorithm based on the time <b>pulses</b> of an <b>encoder</b> is developed to overcome the difficulty of fault diagnosis for helical gears at low rotational speeds. In this proposed algorithm, both acceleration signals and encoder impulse signal are acquired at the same time. The sampling rate and data length in angular domain are determined based on the rotational speed and size of the gear. The vibration signals in angular domain are obtained by re-sampling the vibration signal of the gear in the time domain according to the <b>encoder</b> <b>pulse</b> signal. The fault features of the helical gear at low rotational speed are then obtained with reference to the RMS values in small angular ranges and the order tracking spectrum following the Angular Domain Synchronous Average processing (ADSA). The new algorithm is not only able to reduce the noise and improves the signal to noise ratio by the ADSA method, but also extract s the features of helical gear fault from the meshing position of the faulty gear teeth, hence overcoming the difficulty of fault diagnosis of helical gears rotating at low speed. The experimental results have shown that the new algorithm is more effective than traditional diagnosis methods.

40|$|Abstract: A {{challenging}} {{problem in}} the design of high-tech systems is servo control at high accuracy and at low cost price for its implementation. Conventional solutions are often not feasible, as high resolution encoders are far too expensive and high sample frequencies are prohibitive as controllers have to run on low-cost processors with processing power that is shared with many other tasks. As a possible solution, we present an event-driven controller that is based on an (extremely) low resolution encoder. The control value is updated at each moment that an <b>encoder</b> <b>pulse</b> is detected, yielding zero measurement error. However, as the time between two control updates is varying now, conventional controller design methods do not apply as they normally assume a constant sample time. To deal with this problem, the controller design is performed by transforming the system equations from the time domain to the position (spatial) domain, in which the <b>encoder</b> <b>pulses,</b> and therefore the controller triggering, are equidistant. In this way, the control problem is rewritten as a synchronous problem for a non-linear plant. A gain scheduled controller is designed and analyzed in the spatial domain. This event-driven controller is experimentally validated on a prototype printer in which a 1 <b>pulse</b> per revolution <b>encoder</b> is used to accurately control the motion of images through the printer. By means of analysis, simulation and experiments we show that the control performance is similar to the initially proposed industrial controller that has fixed (high) sample frequency and is based on a much higher encoder resolution. On top of this, the proposed event...|$|R

40|$|Repetitive {{controllers}} {{have been}} shown to be effective for tracking periodic reference commands or for rejecting periodic disturbances. Typical repetitive controllers are synthesized in temporal domain where the periods of the reference or disturbance signals are assumed to be known and stationary. For periodic references and disturbances with varying periods, researchers usually resort to adaptive and robust control approaches. For rotational motion systems where the disturbances or reference signals are spatially periodic (i. e., periodic with respect to angular displacement), the temporal period of the disturbance and reference signals will be inversely proportional to the rotational speed and vary accordingly. Motivating by reducing halftone banding for laser printers, we propose a design framework for synthesizing spatially sampled repetitive controller by reformulating a linear time-invariant system subject to spatially periodic disturbances using angular displacement as the independent variable. The resulting nonlinear system can be represented as a quasi-linear parameter-varying (quasi-LPV) system with the angular velocity as one of the varying state-dependent parameters. An LPV self-gain-scheduling controller that includes a spatially sampled repetitive control can be designed to take into consideration bounded model uncertainty and input nonlinearity, such as actuator saturation.
