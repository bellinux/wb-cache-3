We apply results from random graph theory, which facilitate the analysis of finite-sized graphs and realistic data <b>partitions</b> and <b>noise</b> levels, to obtain a quantification of the effect noisy edges may have on any constrained clustering algorithm under a set of commonly-used assumptions. We also demonstrate the dangers in the common practice of connected-component constraint set augmentation, when used in the presence of noise. Second, we describe two practical randomized algorithms that estimate the number of induced clusters using {{only a small number of}} constraints. We conclude with an experimental evaluation that shows the effect of noise on common UCI data sets, as well as some aspects of the behavior of our algorithms. ...|$|R

During its main phase the algorithm utilizes a distance measure, which is adapted with high precision to the way initial attractors are determined. We applied k-Attractors as well as k-Means, EM and FarthestFirst clustering algorithms to several datasets and compared results. Comparison favored k-Attractors in terms of convergence speed and cluster formation quality in most cases, as it outperforms these 3 algorithms except from cases of datasets with very small cardinality containing only a few frequent itemsets.
