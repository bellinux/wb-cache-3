5|$|It was Dufourny's {{great friend}} and fellow {{architect}} Giuseppe Marvuglia who was to <b>preside</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> gradual decline of Sicilian Baroque. In 1784 he designed the Palazzo Riso-Belmonte, the finest example of this period of architectural transition, combining both Baroque and Palladian motifs, built around an arcaded courtyard providing Baroque masses of light and shade, or chiaroscuro. The main façade, punctuated by giant pilasters, also had Baroque features, but the skyline was unbroken. The pilasters were undecorated, simple, and Ionic, and supported an undecorated entablature. Above the windows were classical unbroken pediments. Sicilian Baroque was waning.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} months, the population radicalized itself, and, on September 18, 1848, {{just one week}} before the Revolution was crushed, crowds entered the Interior Ministry, taking over the official copies of Regulamentul Organic and the register of boyar ranks (Arhondologia). The documents were subsequently paraded through the city in a mock funeral cortege, and burned down, one sheet at a time, {{in the public square}} on Mitropoliei Hill.

5|$|Parker was at {{home when}} the August 1896 term began, too sick to <b>preside</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> court, as he {{suffered}} from Bright's disease.

He is buried at the Fort Smith National Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice {{attempted}} {{to defend the}} company against a takeover, commissioning a report from McKinsey & Company on the future outlook of the company.

5|$|In 1968, Tongan mission {{president}} John H. Groberg {{declared that}} a 50th Anniversary Golden Jubilee would be held. The concept for the celebration was confusing to church members {{as it was}} unclear what the 50th anniversary was honoring. Groberg was not quite sure himself. However, several years prior to his appointment as mission president, Groberg received inspiration that he would <b>preside</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> mission in Tonga and hold a 50th anniversary jubilee during his term. A {{few months before the}} celebration, which was scheduled for November, Groberg received a letter from the widow of Tonga's first mission president. In the letter, she shared that the mission's first conference was held in November 1918. The anniversary of the Tonga's first mission-wide conference became the reason for the jubilee.|$|E
5|$|In Massachusetts, the {{lieutenant}} governor does not <b>preside</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> state Senate, {{as is the case}} in many other states; nevertheless, as lieutenant governor, Coolidge was a deputy governor functioning as administrative inspector and was a member of the governor's council. He was also chairman of the finance committee and the pardons committee. As a full-time elected official, Coolidge discontinued his law practice in 1916, though his family continued to live in Northampton. McCall and Coolidge were both reelected in 1916 and again in 1917. When McCall decided that he would not stand for a fourth term, Coolidge announced his intention to run for governor.|$|E
5|$|Nikita Zotov {{was twice}} married, and had three sons {{from his first}} marriage. One was Vasily Zotov (d. 1729), who was educated outside of Russia and became the Revisor-General of Ukazes (Inspector General of Decrees) in November 1715. As Inspector General, it was Vasily's job to <b>preside</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Senate, enforce its decrees, and report absent {{senators}} to Peter. Vasily had little political power however, and so was unable to fulfill his role {{in opposition to the}} wishes {{of some of the most}} powerful men in the Russian empire. The second son was Ivan Zotov (1687–1723), who lived and studied in France, where he worked as a translator. The third son, Konon Zotov (1690–30 December 1742), studied in England, and served in various positions in the Russian Navy and in the Russian judicial system.|$|E

5|$|The Duke's {{return to}} favour under the House of Hanover {{enabled him to}} <b>preside</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> defeat of the 1715 Jacobite rising from London (although it was his former assistant, Cadogan, who {{directed}} the operations). But his health was fading, and on 28 May 1716 (O.S.), shortly {{after the death of}} his daughter Anne, Countess of Sunderland, he suffered a paralytic stroke at Holywell House. This was followed by another, more severe stroke in November, this time at a house on the Blenheim estate. The Duke recovered somewhat, but while his speech had become impaired his mind remained clear, recovering enough to ride out to watch the builders at work on Blenheim Palace and attend the Lords to vote for Oxford's impeachment.|$|E
5|$|The {{executive}} {{branch of the}} government is headed by a mayor and vice-mayor. As in other South Korean cities and counties, the mayor is elected directly, while the vice-mayor is appointed. As of 2010, the mayor is Choi Yang-sik, who {{was appointed to the}} position on July 1, 2010 after winning the local election held on June 2 of the same year. He is Gyeongju's fifth mayor to be directly elected, the sixth to <b>preside</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> city in its present form, and the 31st mayor since 1955. Like most heads of government in the Yeongnam region, {{he is a member of}} the conservative Grand National Party.|$|E
5|$|Three men {{sought the}} Democratic {{nomination}} for governor at the 1899 party convention in LouisvilleGoebel, Wat Hardin, and William J. Stone. When Hardin {{appeared to be}} the front-runner for the nomination, Stone and Goebel agreed to work together against him. Stone's supporters would back whomever Goebel picked to <b>preside</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> convention. In exchange, half the delegates from Louisville, who were pledged to Goebel, would vote to nominate Stone for governor. Goebel would then drop out of the race, but would name many of the other officials on the ticket. As word of the plan spread, Hardin dropped out of the race, believing he would be beaten by the Stone–Goebel alliance.|$|E
