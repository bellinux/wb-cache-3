5|$|The first <b>production</b> <b>reactor</b> {{that made}} plutonium-239 was the X-10 Graphite Reactor. It went online in 1943 and was built at a {{facility}} in Oak Ridge that {{later became the}} Oak Ridge National Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, Wigner and his Theoretical Group that {{included}} Alvin Weinberg, Katharine Way, Leo Ohlinger, Gale Young and Edward Creutz produced a {{design for a}} <b>production</b> <b>reactor</b> with water cooling. The choice of water as a coolant was controversial, as it was known to absorb neutrons, thereby reducing {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, but Wigner was confident that his group's calculations were correct and that with the purer graphite and uranium that was now available, water would work, while the technical difficulties involved in using helium as a coolant would delay the project.|$|E
5|$|The Hanford Site is {{a mostly}} {{decommissioned}} nuclear production complex {{operated by the}} United States federal government on the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington. The site has been known by many names, including: Hanford Project, Hanford Works, Hanford Engineer Works and Hanford Nuclear Reservation. Established in 1943 {{as part of the}} Manhattan Project in Hanford, south-central Washington, the site was home to the B Reactor, the first full-scale plutonium <b>production</b> <b>reactor</b> in the world. Plutonium manufactured at the site was used in the first nuclear bomb, tested at the Trinity site, and in Fat Man, the bomb detonated over Nagasaki, Japan.|$|E
40|$|This book {{focuses on}} the lineage of America`s <b>production</b> <b>{{reactors}},</b> those three at Hanford and their descendants, the reactors behind America`s nuclear weapons. The work will take only occasional sideways glances at the collateral lines of descent, the reactor cousins designed for experimental purposes, ship propulsion, and electric power generation. Over the decades from 1942 through 1992, fourteen American <b>production</b> <b>reactors</b> made enough plutonium to fuel a formidable arsenal of more than twenty thousand weapons. In {{the last years of}} that period, planners, nuclear engineers, and managers struggled over designs {{for the next generation of}} <b>production</b> <b>reactors.</b> The story of fourteen individual machines and of the planning effort to replace them might appear relatively narrow. Yet these machines lay at the heart of the nation`s nuclear weapons complex. The story of these machines is the story of arming the winning weapon, supplying the nuclear arms race. This book is intended to capture the history of the first fourteen <b>production</b> <b>reactors,</b> and associated design work, in the face of the end of the Cold War...|$|R
25|$|The Hanford Site near Richland WA {{operated}} Plutonium <b>production</b> nuclear <b>reactors</b> and separations facilities during World War 2 and the Cold War. Nine Plutonium <b>production</b> <b>reactors</b> {{were built}} and operated there. The first being the B-Reactor which began operations in September 1944 {{and the last}} being the N-Reactor which ceased operations in January 1987.|$|R
50|$|The Mayak Production Association (Производственное объединение «Маяк», from Маяк 'lighthouse') {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} nuclear {{facilities}} in the Russian Federation, housing plutonium <b>production</b> <b>reactors</b> and a reprocessing plant. The closest city is Ozyorsk.|$|R
5|$|Most of the {{reactors}} {{were shut down}} between 1964 and 1971, with an average individual life span of 22 years. The last reactor, N Reactor, continued to operate as a dual-purpose reactor, being both a power reactor used to feed the civilian electrical grid via the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) and a plutonium <b>production</b> <b>reactor</b> for nuclear weapons. N Reactor operated until 1987. Since then, most of the Hanford reactors have been entombed ("cocooned") to allow the radioactive materials to decay, and the surrounding structures have been removed and buried. The B-Reactor has not been cocooned and is accessible to the public on occasional guided tours. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992, and some historians advocate converting it into a museum. B reactor was designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service on August 19, 2008.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Fermi {{inserted}} the first uranium fuel slug into the B Reactor at the Hanford Site, the <b>production</b> <b>reactor</b> designed to breed plutonium in large quantities. Like X-10, {{it had been}} designed by Fermi's team at the Metallurgical Laboratory, and built by DuPont, but it was much larger, and was water-cooled. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded, and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared to be well, but around 03:00, the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The Army and DuPont turned to Fermi's team for answers. The cooling water was investigated {{to see if there}} was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor suddenly started up again, only to shut down once more a few hours later. The problem was traced to neutron poisoning from xenon-135, a fission product with a half-life of 9.2 hours. Fortunately, DuPont had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this over-engineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of plutonium {{was found to}} resemble uranium {{after a few months}} of initial study. Early research was continued at the secret Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago. On August 20, 1942, a trace quantity of this element was isolated and measured for the first time. About 50micrograms of plutonium-239 combined with uranium and fission products was produced and only about 1microgram was isolated. This procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element's atomic weight. On December 2, 1942, on a racket court under the west grandstand at the University of Chicago's Stagg Field, researchers headed by Enrico Fermi achieved the first self-sustaining chain reaction in a graphite and uranium pile known as CP-1. Using theoretical information garnered from the operation of CP-1, DuPont constructed an air-cooled experimental <b>production</b> <b>reactor,</b> known as X-10, and a pilot chemical separation facility at Oak Ridge. The separation facility, using methods developed by Glenn T. Seaborg and a team of researchers at the Met Lab, removed plutonium from uranium irradiated in the X-10 reactor. Information from CP-1 was also useful to Met Lab scientists designing the water-cooled plutonium production reactors for Hanford. Construction at the site began in mid-1943.|$|E

25|$|After the 1965 India-Pakistan War, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Foreign {{minister}} at that time, began {{to lobby for}} a nuclear weapons option. 'If India builds the bomb, we will eat grass or leaves, even go hungry, but we will get one of our own. We have no other choice'. 'In October 1965, Bhutto visited Vienna to attend the International Atomic Energy Agency meeting. While there, he met with Munir Ahmad Khan, and other Pakistani scientists working at IAEA. Pakistani IAEA scientists briefed Bhutto on the rapid development of Indian nuclear programme. According to Munir Ahmad Khan, the nuclear facility at Trombay consisted of a plutonium <b>production</b> <b>reactor,</b> a reprocessing plant, and other facilities associated to weapon production. Bhutto quickly arranged a meeting with Ayub Khan. After this meeting, Ayub Khan remained unconvinced, and rejected the proposal made by Munir Ahmad Khan. Khan notified Bhutto immediately and told him about what had happened.|$|E
500|$|The B Reactor (105-B) at Hanford was {{the first}} {{large-scale}} plutonium <b>production</b> <b>reactor</b> in the world. It was designed and built by DuPont based on an experimental design by Enrico Fermi, and originally operated at 250megawatts (thermal). The reactor was graphite moderated and water cooled. It consisted of a , [...] graphite cylinder lying on its side, penetrated through its entire length horizontally by 2,004aluminium tubes. [...] (180t) of uranium slugs, [...] diameter by [...] long, sealed in aluminium cans went into the tubes. Cooling water was pumped through the aluminium tubes around the uranium slugs {{at the rate of}} [...] per minute.|$|E
500|$|Metallurgical work {{concentrated}} on uranium and plutonium. Although {{it had been}} discovered over a century before, little was known about uranium, {{as evidenced by the}} fact that many references gave a figure for its melting point that was off by nearly [...] Edward Creutz investigated it and discovered that at the right temperature range, uranium could be hammered and rolled, and drawn into the rods required by the <b>production</b> <b>reactor</b> design. It was found that when uranium was cut, the shavings would burst into flame. Working with Alcoa and General Electric, the Metallurgical Laboratory devised a method of soldering the aluminum jacket to the uranium slug.|$|E

25|$|In the U.S., {{however, the}} first {{experimental}} atomic reactor (1942), {{as well as}} the Manhattan Project Hanford <b>production</b> <b>reactors</b> that produced the plutonium for the Trinity test and Fat Man bombs, all used pure carbon (graphite) neutron moderators combined with normal water cooling pipes. They functioned with neither enriched uranium nor heavy water. Russian and British plutonium production also used graphite-moderated reactors.|$|R
500|$|At the Combined Policy Committee {{meeting in}} February 1946, without prior {{consultation}} with Canada, the British announced {{their intention to}} build a graphite-moderated nuclear reactor in the United Kingdom. An outraged Howe told Canadian ambassador Lester B. Pearson to inform the Committee that nuclear cooperation between Britain and Canada was at an end. The Canadians had been given what they deemed assurances that the Chalk River Laboratories would be a joint enterprise, and regarded the British decision as a breach of faith. Anglo-American cooperation largely ended in April 1946 when Truman declared that the United States would not assist Britain in the design, construction or operation of a plutonium <b>production</b> <b>reactor.</b> The Americans had agreed that such a facility could be built in Canada, but the British were not willing {{to be dependent on}} Canada for the supply of fissile material.|$|E
500|$|A vexing {{question}} {{at the time was}} how a <b>production</b> <b>reactor</b> should be cooled. Taking a conservative view that every possible neutron must be preserved, the majority opinion initially favored cooling with helium, which would absorb very few neutrons. Szilard argued that if this was a concern, then liquid bismuth would be a better choice. He supervised experiments with it, but the practical difficulties turned out to be too great. In the end, Wigner's plan to use ordinary water as a coolant won out. When the coolant issue became too heated, Compton {{and the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., moved to dismiss Szilard, who was still a German citizen, but the Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, refused to do so. [...] Szilard was therefore present on December 2, 1942, when the first man-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was achieved in the first nuclear reactor under viewing stands of Stagg Field, and shook Fermi's hand.|$|E
2500|$|Even though Zia {{had removed}} the Bhutto {{sentiment}} in the nuclear energy project, Zia did not completely disband Bhutto's policy on nuclear weapons. [...] After the retirement of Zahid Ali Akbar, Zia transferred control of the nuclear weapons programme to Bhutto's close aide Munir Ahmad Khan, Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. Soon, Zia promoted Khan as the technical director of the entire programme as well as appointing Khan as his Science Adviser. With the support of handpicked civilian Prime Minister Muhammad Juneijo, Zia sanctioned {{the launch of the}} 50 Megawatt (MW) heavy water plutonium <b>production</b> <b>reactor,</b> known as Khushab-I, at Khushab in 1985. Zia also took initiatives to launched the space projects as spin-off to nuclear project. Zia appointed nuclear engineer Salim Mehmud as the Administrator of the Space Research Commission. Zia also launched the work on the country's first satellite, Badr-1, a military satellite. In 1987, Zia launched the clandestine aerospace project, the Integrated Missile Research Programme under General Anwar Shamim in 1985, and later under Lieutenant-General Talat Masood in 1987.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, the United States {{began using}} heavy water in {{plutonium}} <b>production</b> <b>reactors</b> at the Savannah River Site.

40|$|The {{longitudinal}} (axial) flux {{distribution in}} the Hanford <b>production</b> <b>reactors</b> quite closely approximates a ``chopped`` cosine.

[...] "Thanks to information provided by their agents", Moynihan wrote in his book Secrecy, [...] "they did it in four." [...] In his posthumously published memoirs, Nikita Khrushchev, leader of the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964, said that he [...] "cannot specifically say what kind of help the Rosenbergs provided us" [...] but that he learned from Joseph Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov that they [...] "had provided very significant help in accelerating the production of our atomic bomb." [...] However Boris V. Brokhovich, the engineer who later became director of Chelyabinsk-40, the plutonium <b>production</b> <b>reactor</b> and extraction facility that the Soviet Union used to create its first bomb material, called Khrushchev a 'silly fool' and claimed the development of the bomb had been a matter of trial and error. [...] "You sat the Rosenbergs in the electric chair for nothing," [...] he said. [...] "We got nothing from the Rosenbergs." [...] The notes allegedly typed by Ethel apparently contained little that was directly used in the Soviet atomic bomb project.

25|$|Since uranium and {{plutonium}} are {{nuclear weapons}} materials, {{there have been}} proliferation concerns. Ordinarily (in spent nuclear fuel), plutonium is reactor-grade plutonium. In addition to plutonium-239, which is highly suitable for building nuclear weapons, it contains large amounts of undesirable contaminants: plutonium-240, plutonium-241, and plutonium-238. These isotopes are extremely difficult to separate, and more cost-effective ways of obtaining fissile material exist (e.g. uranium enrichment or dedicated plutonium <b>production</b> <b>reactors).</b>|$|R
5|$|The Thin Man gun-type {{design was}} at that time based on the fissibility of the very pure plutonium-239 isotope so far only {{produced}} in microgram quantities by the Berkeley cyclotron. When the Hanford <b>production</b> <b>reactors</b> came on-line in early 1944, the mix of plutonium-239 and plutonium-240 obtained was found to have a high rate of spontaneous fission. To avoid pre-detonation, the muzzle velocity of the gun-type design would need to be greatly raised, making it impractically long.|$|R
