He was being <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the Liberal candidate for Ilford in the 1918 general election but grew disheartened by the Liberal alliance with the Conservative Party, and also by the divisions in the party; as a result, he gave up the candidacy.|$|E

Under {{the terms of the}} Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the transfer was not recognized; instead, Radetzky was given to Italy and broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|With the {{war going}} against the Austrians {{by the end of}} 1918, Zrínyi was <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{transferred}} to the new State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. On 10 November 1918, just one day {{before the end of the}} war, navy officers sailed the battleship out of Pola (Pula) and eventually surrendered to a squadron of American submarine chasers. Following the handover to the United States Navy, she was briefly designated USS Zrínyi. In the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the transfer was not recognized; instead, Zrínyi was given to Italy and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war in August 1914, the British regular army was a small professional force. It consisted of 247,432 regular troops organised in four regiments of Guards (Grenadier, with 3 Battalions; Coldstream, with 3 Battalions; Scots, with 2 Battalions; Irish with 1 Battalion), 68 regiments of the line and the Rifle Brigade (despite its name, this was an infantry regiment), 31 cavalry regiments, artillery and other support arms. Most of the line infantry regiments had two regular battalions, one of which served at home and provided drafts and replacements to the other which was stationed overseas, while also being <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of the Expeditionary Force - the Royal Fusiliers, Worcestershire Regiment, Middlesex Regiment, King's Royal Rifle Corps and the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) had four regular battalions, two of which served overseas. Almost half of the regular army (74 of the 157 infantry battalions and 12 of the 31 cavalry regiments), was stationed overseas in garrisons throughout the British Empire. The Royal Flying Corps was part of the British Army until 1918. At {{the outbreak}} of the war, it consisted of 84 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Müller was <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loaned or even {{transferred}} away to find first-team football, {{but when}} Louis van Gaal was appointed manager, both players became fixtures in the Bayern first {{team from the}} start of the season. In the first few matches, Müller was a regular substitute, and on 12 September 2009, he was brought on against Borussia Dortmund and scored two goals in a 5–1 victory. Three days later, he scored another brace in a 3–0 Champions League victory over Maccabi Haifa. He rounded off September by being named the Bundesliga Player of the Month and earned praise from his namesake, legendary former Bayern and Germany striker Gerd Müller. After the Haifa match, Müller was in the starting XI for almost every match, only missing one match, a Champions League match against Bordeaux, for which he was suspended, because he was sent off in an earlier match against the same team.|$|E

5|$|The {{expedition}} {{to cut down}} the badnjak is the basic activity in the preparation part of the celebration. It can be performed by an individual, but it is usually a collective act accompanied by a festive procession that may include carriages and horsemen. After the tree {{to be used as}} the badnjak is cut down, it is adorned with straw, ribbons, oranges, apples, and sometimes with the Serbian flag. In some parishes more than one badnjak is used in the celebration, and a different tree is felled for each. Often bunches of leaved oak twigs are <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> distributed to the congregation gathered at the church. Each badnjak is festively taken to the church gate, often transported on carriages. The badnjak may be taken into the churchyard without any ceremony, or it may be followed by a procession, {{as is the case in}} parts of Republika Srpska and the Bay of Kotor.|$|E

Lithuania is determined to restructure the armed forces so that from the end of 2014, one tenth of the Land Forces could at any given time be deployed for international operations, while half of the Land Forces would be <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> deployed outside Lithuania's borders.|$|E
