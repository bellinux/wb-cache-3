40|$|Pure-tone {{testing is}} the primary audiological test {{procedure}} for the differential diagnosis of hearing loss and hearing disorders in school-aged children. No research is currently available internationally for children’s responses to continuous versus pulsed pure-tones. The aim of this exploratory investigation was to compare {{the performance of a}} group of school-aged children on continuous versus pulsed pure-tone audiometry. The aims were to determine whether a threshold difference existed between continuous versus pulsed <b>puretones</b> and to record whether a listener preference existed between continuous versus pulsed tones for the frequency range of 125 to 8000 H z. Eighteen children (36 ears) aged between 8 - 12 years, participated in a hearing evaluation as well as in a brief three-question interview. Descriptive statistics viz. average threshold, mean difference and standard deviation of thresholds were used to analyse data. Listeners’ perceived preferences were calculated in percentages and reasons for preferring one signal over another was analysed qualitatively. Although the automatically pulsed tone threshold (averaged across the frequencies tested) was lower than for the continuous tone, the difference was only 0. 2 dB in the left ear and 0. 5 dB in the right ear. This small difference is not important in clinical applications for which 5 dB increments are used in pure-tone audiometry. Where a listener preference was indicated, however, the continuous tones were preferred over pulsed tones by 56 % percent of subjects. These findings differ from similar studies involving adults. This revealed that children may yield different preferences during pure-tone testing than adults and that these preferences should be taken into consideration during testing...|$|R

40|$|Distortion product otoacoustic {{emissions}} (DPOAEs) is {{an objective}} sensitive test of cochlear function. The {{aim of this}} study was the evaluation of noise-induced hearing loss in a group of industrial workers, using this method in conjunction with standard <b>puretone</b> audiometry (PTA). One hundred and five subjects (210 ears) were included in the study. PTA, tympanometry, and DPOAEs were performed. Results were analyzed using a mixed analysis of variance model, and compared with the data of 34 normal persons of similar age and sex. We found statistically significant lower DPOAE levels in the noise-exposed group than in the control group. Additionally, the effect of frequency was significant, indicating that amplitude varied across frequency, with lower responses observed at 4 and 6 kHz, and maximum response found at 2 kHz. PTA showed a statistically significant effect of Group, owed to elevated <b>puretone</b> thresholds in the noise-exposed subjects, but a Frequency main effect was not found, although the interaction between Frequency and Group was statistically significant, as well as the interaction between Frequency and Ear. A main effect for Ear was found only in <b>puretone</b> thresholds, due to better thresholds in the left ears of the subjects, and not in DPOAE measurements. DPOAE levels were selectively affected at the higher frequencies, whereas <b>puretone</b> thresholds were affected at all frequencies. Direct comparison of the number of significantly affected ears between the two methods at 1, 2, and 4 kHz showed statistically significant differences at all comparisons, with more ears affected in PTA in comparison with DPOAEs at 4 kHz, whereas more ears were affected in DPOAEs at the lower frequencies (1 and 2 kHz). Therefore, it may be concluded that DPOAEs and PTA are both sensitive methods in detecting noise-induced hearing loss, with DPOAEs tending to be more sensitive at lower frequencies...|$|E

40|$|Summary Exposure to noise has a {{harmful effect}} on the {{auditory}} health of workers. Aim: The main goal {{of this paper was}} to establish the role of pure-tone audiometry and evoked transient otoacoustic emissions in the detection of small temporary auditory changes after exposure to high sound pressure levels. Study Design: a cross-sectional cohort study. Material and Methods: 30 otologically normal subjects aged between 20 and 35 years were submitted to pure-tone audiometry and evoked transiente otoacoustic emissions before and after 5 hours of exposure to high sound pressure levels (betweeen 80 and 90 dB). Results: For pure-tone audiometry the largest changes occurred at high frequencies - from 3 KHz to 8 KHz after exposure. The evoked transient otoacoustic emissions showed reduced reproductibility from 1 KHz to 4 KHz after exposure to noise. Conclusion: We noted that both <b>puretone</b> audiometry and evoked transient otoacoustic emissions had a role in detecting statistically significant changes in the auditory threshold and in reproductibility, after exposure to high sound pressure levels...|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the role of cytokines and soluble adhesion molecules in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) with respect to their pure-tone audiometry values. Material and Methods: This study analyses blood samples of 51 patients with SSNHL. Serum levels of ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1, E-selectin, IL- 6, IL- 8, and MCP- 1 were evaluated by ELISA. Pure-tone audiometry data were compared before and after a systemic steroid treatment regimen. The subjects with SSNHL were compared to a control group of 44 patients with normal hearing and matching age and gender. The data complete our previous data collection.

40|$|Audiologists are {{challenged}} with various neurological diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis. This disease causes demyelination {{of the white}} matter in {{the central nervous system}} resulting in desynchronisation of neural impulses. Despite controversy in the literature many studies illustrated some degree of auditory involvement associated with this disease. The auditory brainstem response has dominated the field during the assessment of the auditory system of patients with Multiple Sclerosis. Although this objective test procedure is useful during the assessment of the auditory nerve on a brainstem level, it reveals its own set of limitations when used in isolation as a single test procedure. A multiple test battery approach has shown promise in addressing the limitations of any single test procedure. This approach aims to assess the auditory nervous system of patients with Multiple Sclerosis on different levels (sensory and neural). The aim of the current {{study was to determine the}} effectiveness of a clinically appropriate battery of test procedures during the assessment of the auditory nervous system of 25 adult subjects with Multiple Sclerosis. The subjects were divided into two groups: Group 1 consisted of fifteen (15) subjects without a history of noise exposure, whereas the ten (10) subjects in Group 2 had previously been exposed to noise. A combined experimental-descriptive research design was selected in order to describe both the qualitative and quantitative results obtained during the study. The following test procedures were included in the test battery: • A self-assessment questionnaire allowing subjects to report on hearing abilities, related auditory-vestibular symptoms and communicative competence during every day life; • <b>Puretone</b> audiometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions as well as the cochlear microphonic; and • Auditory brainstem response recording using both the rarefaction and condensation click polarities consecutively. The results indicated that a high percentage of subjects experienced vestibular symptoms such as dizziness and vertigo by the time the study was conducted. The presence of tinnitus and hearing difficulties were uncommon among subjects. Despite this, more than half of the subjects experienced difficulty with communication in the presence of background noise. <b>Puretone</b> audiometry demonstrated that some of the subjects presented with mild high-frequency hearing losses. However other configurations with impaired hearing thresholds were also observed. Most of the subjects’ auditory brainstem response recordings displayed abnormalities using either the rarefaction or condensation click polarity. The use of the condensation click polarity displayed more ABR abnormalities compared to the rarefaction click polarity. Several subjects displayed additional cochlear involvement while a smaller percentage of subjects presented only with neural involvement.

We also obtained ABR and CAER findings in 2 cases of familial spastic paraplegia, in 5 cases of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and 6 {{in cases of}} atypical FA of uncertain classification. The results of <b>puretone</b> and impedance audiometry were normal in all cases. ABR could not be elicited in 11 FA patients and were abnormal at higher intensity levels in the remaining 4 patients.

CAERs were normal in all 28 patients. ABRs tended to be absent with the progression of FA. ABR thresholds were correlated with the Inherited Ataxias Clinical Rating Scale score, which is an index {{of the severity of}} the illness. ABRs contributed to the diagnosis or to excluding FA in patients with an atypical clinical picture.

Methods and Materials: This study {{was carried out}} in a cross - sectional descriptive survey - on 1200 students (600 girls and 600 boys) among the student of primary school of Neishabbor, academic year 1376 - 77 Results: 1 - Otoscopy examination; abnormal conditions of external ear canal was found in 14. 1 % of cases; mostly impacted ceruman (13. 6 %); Abnormal conditions of tympanic membrane (0. 4 %) and foreign body 0. 16 %. Abnormal conditions of external ear canal was statistically unmeaningful. (P V= 0. 8) 2 - Impedance Audiometiy: 5. 75 % Abnormal tympanograms were observed, mostly type C (3. 15 %) 3 - Pure Tone Audiometry: An overall 5. 5 % hearing loss was found in this population including 3 % bilateral and 1. 25 % unilateral hearing loss. Only conductive hearing loss was found in this population (2. 7 % in right ear and 3. 5 % in left ear), PV= 0. 9. Hearing loss observed mostly in girls but the difference was slight. Family background showed no effects on the hearing disorders. 9. 8 % of cases were in need of medical care and 0. 3 % were in need of rehabilitation services. Only 28. 8 % of parents, 36. 3 % of teachers and 40. 9 % of afflicted students were aware of the problem...|$|E
