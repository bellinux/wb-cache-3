The individual sheets are highly localized and of small areal extent (< 200 m 2), though no vent sites were found. Several facies associations of hyaloclastite, with pillow talus, knobbly fist-sized lava fragments and thin sheet lava (< 10 cm) underlying hyaloclastite, are identified. Recovered samples consist of angular, polyhedral sand-sized sideromelane shards and thin, bent, plate-like sideromelane fragments called Limu O'Pelee. Limu are solidified fragments of burst magma bubbles, which formed by vapourization of water entrapped by lava. Analysis of lava and hyaloclastite shards including limu shows three geochemically distinct populations, depleted MORB (N 1), more evolved NMORB (N 2) and hawaiite (H) of diverse composition. In individual hyaloclastite samples, shards {{of two or three}} different types may occur in various proportions, though in samples of hyaloclastite associated with sheet lava the predominant shards are of the same geochemical type as the sheet lava. Deposition of hyaloclastites occurred from lateral density currents formed by transformation from convective suspension settling. Grain size distribution, settling behaviour of different co-deposited shard types and sedimentary structures, together with <b>pelagic</b> <b>ooze</b> in the matrix and geochemically mixed shard populations, indicate some erosion, traction reworking and turbulence during transport. Critical observations are that contorted sheet lava protrudes through hyaloclastite and that sheet lava flow vugs commonly contain <b>pelagic</b> <b>ooze.</b> Facies associations plus consideration of limu formation allow the establishment of a new, multi-component model of hyaloclastite formation. It is inferred that the formation of limu-bearing sheet hyaloclastite involves entrapment of pelagic sediment beneath or within lava. This leads to limu bubble formation and suppressed tephra jetting. Together with convectively rising water heated by the lava flow, these processes loft shards slightly into the water column, from which they settle singly or in vertical sediment gravity flows that are redirected to flow along the seafloor...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the more}} ambitious goals of the Seismogenic Zone Experiment (SEIZE) is to {{discriminate}} between the effects of changing intrinsic frictional strength (i. e., gouge versus wall-rock) {{and the effects of}} gradual or transient increases in pore pressure within fault zones. In subduction zones, both variables are likely to change with increasing distance down the plate boundary. In addition to sediment’s cohesion and coefficient of internal friction, the shear strength of any given stratigraphic interval depends upon fluid pressure and total normal stress. The release of fluids from mudstones during diagenesis (including volatiles generated from organic matter) is modulated by a combination of mechanical compaction, tectonic consolidation, and mineral reactions. Thus, it is essential to determine how permeability, sediment-derived fluid sources, and fluid flow contribute to overpressure conditions within the subduction inputs, beginning seaward of the subduction front at depths of 2500 m or less. Primary lithostratigraphic architecture exerts a first-order influence over the material properties and tectonic behavior of subduction zones, at least near the toe of the margin wedge. Generic sedimentary facies models for trenches (Piper et al., 1973) show upward thickening and coarsening trends (from basalt at the base through <b>pelagic</b> <b>ooze,</b> hemipelagic mud, silty turbidites, and sandy turbi-dites).

The large variations which occur in the concentration f some trace elements inthe Mn-oxide crusts and in transition metal ratios in the nontronite compared with the <b>pelagic</b> <b>ooze</b> suggests a hydrothermal supply to the mounds ofLi, Mo, Pb, and Ba in addition to Mn, Fe, and silica.

Approximately 3. 5 km of sediment was recovered from nine sites, in water depths ranging from 202 to 3875 m. Most drilling took place on the shelf edge and upper slope, in a water depth of 202 – 784 m, through a mainly carbonate succession. Two distinct groups of strata, Eocene–middle Miocene and late Pliocene–Quaternary in age, form the upper Cenozoic component of the continental margin, separated by a thin, upper middle Miocene– lower Pliocene interval characterized by slumps, sediment gravity-flow deposits, and/or unconformities.

Sedimentary characters indicate a permanently subaqueous but nonmarine environment, with turbidites accumulating in a rapidly subsiding basin. According to the model proposed, this basin was fed by continental waters during times of maximum evaporitic draw-down, with temporary marine incursions from the west or southwest when the water level was higher. A basement ridge separated the evaporating pond from this endoreic lake located on the opposite (eastern) margin of the Tyrrhenian Basin, which was then limited to its western part.

The mapped area covers ∼ 25, 500 km 2 and incorporates broad ridges, valleys and plateaus. Superimposed on these features are clusters of volcanic peaks, smaller ridges, holes, scarps and aprons. An additional characteristic of the seabed in this area is an extensive network of polygonal furrows that covers the plateau and the lower slopes of larger ridges. These furrows are formed in stiff, unconsolidated carbonate ooze that forms a near-continuous sediment cover across the area. Peaks are the only geomorphic feature not fully draped in <b>pelagic</b> <b>ooze.</b> The distribution of geomorphic units suggests strong controls from underlying geological structures. In water depths of 1400 to 1600 m some peaks occur in clusters on ridges that sit above acoustic basement highs and volcanic intrusions.

In contrast, localised geomorphic elements such as moats and holes have likely explanation in terms of spatial variations in sedimentation rates in relation to bathymetric highs. Polygonal furrows are attributed to dewatering processes. The geomorphology of the seabed mapped in this study incorporates examples of forms that have not been previously mapped in such detail on the Australian margin.

Prior to about 42 Ma, Broken Ridge formed {{the northern part of}} the broad Kerguelen-Broken Ridge Plateau. During the middle Eocene, this feature was split by the newly forming Southeast Indian Ocean Ridge; since then, Broken Ridge has drifted north from about 55 ° to 31 °S. The lower part of the sedimentary section is characterized by Turonian to Santonian tuffs that contain abundant glauconite and some carbonate. The tuffs record a large but apparently local volcanic input that characterized the central part of Broken Ridge into the early Tertiary. Maestrichtian shallow-water(several hundred to 1000 m depth) limestones and cherts accumulated at some of the highest rates ever documented from the open ocean, 4 to 5 g/cm** 2 /kyr. A complete (with all biostratigraphic zones) Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary section was recovered from site 752. The first 1. 5 m. y. of the Tertiary is characterized by an order-of-magnitude reduction in the flux of biogenic sediments, indicating a period of sharply reduced biological productivity at 55 °S, following which the carbonate and silica sedimentation rates almost reach the previous high values of the latest Cretaceous. We recovered a complete section through the Paleocene that contains all major fossil groups and is more than 300 m thick, perhaps the best pelagic Paleocene section encountered in ocean drilling. About 42 Ma, Broken Ridge was uplifted 2500 m in response to the intra-plateau rifting event; subsequent erosion and deposition has resulted in a prominent Eocene angular unconformity atop the ridge.

From 0 to 100 m, in Holocene to Pleistocene diatom and nannofossil oozes (excluding debris flows), velocities are approximately equivalent {{to that of the}} interstitial seawater, and thus acoustic reflections in the upper 100 m are primarily caused by variations in density and porosity. Below 100 or 200 m, acoustic reflections are caused by variations in both velocity and density. From 100 to 467 m, in Miocene-Oligocene nannofossil ooze, clay, marl, debris flows, and mud, acoustic anisotropy irregularly increases to 10 %, with 2 to 5 % being typical. From 467 to 1103 m in Paleocene to late Albian Cenomanian interbedded mudstone, marlstone, chalk, clastic limestone, and black shale in the lower portion of the hole, velocities range from 1. 6 to 5. 48 km/s, and acoustic anisotropies are as great as 47 % (1. 0 km/s) faster horizontally. Mudstone and uncemented sandstone have anisotropies which irregularly increase with increasing depth from 5 to 10 % (0. 2 km/s). Calcareous mudstones have the greatest anisotropies, typically 35 % (0. 6 km/s). Below 1103 m, basalt velocities ranged from 4. 68 to 4. 98 km/s. A typical value is about 4. 8 km/s. In situ velocities are calculated from velocity data obtained in the laboratory. These are corrected for in situ temperature, hydrostatic pressure, and porosity rebound (expansion when the overburden pressure is released). These corrections do not include rigidity variations caused by overburden pressures. These corrections affect semiconsolidated sedimentary rocks the most (up to 0. 25 km/s faster). These laboratory velocities appear to be greater than the velocities from the sonic log. Reflection coefficients derived from the laboratory data, in general, agree with the major features on the seismic profiles. These indicate more potential reflectors than indicated from the reflection coefficients derived using the Gearhart-Owen Sonic Log from 625 to 940 m, because the Sonic Log data average thin beds. Porosity-density data versus depth for mud, mudstone, and <b>pelagic</b> <b>oozes</b> agree with data for similar sediments as summarized in Hamilton (1976). At depths of about 400 m and about 850 m are zones of relatively higher porosity mudstones, which may suggest anomalously high pore pressure; however, they are more probably caused by variations in grain-size distribution and lithology. Electrical resistivity (horizontal) from 625 to 950 m ranged from about 1. 0 to 4. 0 ohm-m, in Maestrichtian to Santonian- Coniacian mudstone, marlstone, chalk, clastic limestone, and sandstone. An interstitial-water resistivity curve did not indicate any unexpected lithology or unusual fluid or gas in the pores of the rock. These logs were above the black shale beds.

Due to the multiple ways in which climate impinges on depositional systems, the orbital signals are recorded in a multiplicity of parameters, and affect different sedimentary facies in different ways. In platform carbonates, for example, the chief effect is via sea-level variations (possibly tied to fluctuating ice volume), resulting in cycles of emergence and submergence. In limnic systems it finds its most dramatic expression in alternations of lake and playa conditions. Biogenic <b>pelagic</b> <b>oozes</b> such as chalks and the limestones derived from them display variations in the carbonate supplied by planktonic organisms such as coccolithophores and foraminifera, and also record variations in the aeration of bottom waters. Whereas early studies of stratigraphic cyclicity relied mainly on bedding variations visible in the field, present studies are supplementing these with instrumental scans of geochemical, paleontological, and geophysical parameters which yield quantitative curves amenable to time-series analysis; such analysis is, however, limited by problems of distorted time-scales. My own work has been largely concentrated on pelagic systems. In these, the sensitivity of pelagic organisms to climatic-oceanic changes, combined with the sensitivity of botton life to changes in oxygen availability (commonly much more restricted in the Past than now) has left cyclic patterns related to orbital forcing. These systems are further attractive because (1) they tend to offer depositional continuity, and (2) presence of abundant microfossils yields close ties to geochronology. A tantalizing possibility that stratigraphy may yield a record of orbital signals unrelated to climate has turned up in magnetic studies of our Cretaceous core. Magnetic secular variations here carry a strong 39 ka periodicity, corresponding to the theoretical obliquity period of that time - Does the obliquity cycle perhaps have some direct influence on the magnetic field...|$|R
40|$|The Maldive Ridge is a {{volcanic}} lineament overlain by locally 3. 3 km of mostly shallow-water carbonate sediments. The Maldive basement appears on seismic profiles as {{a volcanic}} plateau generated during two distinct eruptive phases separated by {{an episode of}} tectonic deformation. This deformation created a series of en-echelon pull-apart structures along the ridge acoustic basement and {{can be related to}} intraplate compression following the initial stages of the India-Asia collision. The deformation possibly triggered the extrusion of the basaltic flows overlying the acoustic basement and constituting the lithologic basement of the Maldive carbonate system. Widespread neritic carbonate sedimentation was initiated during the Eocene when the broad and relatively flat volcanic substrate started sinking below sea level. In spite of the lava flow extrusion, the initial depressions corresponding to the structural pull-apart basins remained as deep internal seaways surrounded by reefal margins until the late Oligocene. The Eocene-Early Oligocene depositional signature remained essentially aggradational and corresponds to a first transgressive cycle associated with a second-order sea-level rise. In the mid-Oligocene, a pronounced sea-level fall matching the development of a major ice sheet in Antarctica restricted the sedimentation to the internal basins. During the following transgression, the neritic carbonate system temporarily kept up with the sea-level rise, but was finally drowned near the Oligocene-Miocene boundary. In the early Miocene, <b>pelagic</b> <b>ooze</b> deposition covered the Paleogene neritic system and transformed the central troughs into one single deep basin, the paleo-Inner Sea. During the Neogene, following the establishment of a reef framework near the present location of the platform edge, systematic progradations of carbonate bank margins toward the central Inner Sea basin correspond to a long-term sea-level fall associated with a second-order regressive cycle. Segmentation of the prograding complex into individual carbonate banks occurred through local channeling and drowning events. Finally, the late Pliocene-Pleistocene depositional signature is mainly aggradational and corresponds to a regional modification from flat-topped carbonate banks to atoll physiographies. The onset of high-frequency eustatic and climatic changes following the initiation of Northern Hemisphere glaciation explains this evolution...|$|E
40|$|The Louisville Seamount Trail is a 4300 km long {{volcanic}} {{chain that}} has {{been built in the}} past 80 m. y. as the Pacific plate moved over a persistent mantle melting anomaly or hotspot. Because of its linear morphology and its long-lived age-progressive volcanism, Louisville is the South Pacific counterpart of the much better studied Hawaiian-Emperor Seamount Trail. Together, Louisville and Hawaii are textbook examples of two primary hotspots that have been keystones in deciphering the motion of the Pacific plate relative to a set of "fixed" deep-mantle plumes. However, drilling during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 197 in the Emperor Seamounts documented a large 15 Â° southward motion of the Hawaiian hotspot prior to 50 Ma. Is it possible that the Hawaiian and Louisville hotspots moved in concert and thus constitute a moving reference frame for modeling plate motion in the Pacific? Alternatively, could they have moved independently, as predicted by mantle flow models that reproduce the observed latitudinal motion for Hawaii but that predict a largely longitudinal shift for the Louisville hotspot? These two end-member geodynamic models were tested during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 330 to the Louisville Seamount Trail. In addition, existing data from dredged lavas suggest that the mantle plume source of the Louisville hotspot has been remarkably homogeneous for as long as 80 m. y. These lavas are predominantly alkali basalts and likely represent a mostly alkalic shield-building stage, which is {{in sharp contrast to the}} massive tholeiitic shield-building stage of Hawaiian volcanoes. Geochemical and isotopic data for the recovered lavas during Expedition 330 will provideinsights into the magmatic evolution and melting processes of individualLouisville volcanoes, their progression from shield-building to postshield and (maybe) posterosional stages, the temperature and depth of partial melting of their mantle plume source, and the enigmatic long-lived and apparent geochemical homogeneity of the Louisville mantle source. Collectively, this will enable us to characterize the Louisville Seamount Trail as a product of one of the few global primary hotspots, to better constrain its plume-lithosphere interactions, and to further test the hypothesis that the Ontong Java Plateau formed from the plume head of the Louisville mantle plume around 120 Ma. During Expedition 330 we replicated the drilling strategy of Leg 197, the first expedition to provide compelling evidence for the motion of the Hawaiian mantle plume between 80 and 50 Ma. For that reason we targeted Louisville seamounts that have ages similar to Detroit, Suiko, Nintoku, and Koko Seamounts in the Emperor Seamount Trail. In total, five seamounts were drilled in the Louisville Seamount Trail: Canopus, Rigil, Burton, Achernar, and Hadar Guyots (old to young). By analyzing a large number of time-independent in situ lava flows (and other volcanic eruptive products) from these seamounts using modern paleomagnetic, 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronological, and geochemical techniques, we will be able to directly compare the paleolatitude estimates and geochemical signatures between the two longest-lived hotspot systems in the Pacific Ocean. We drilled into the summits of the five Louisville guyots and reached volcanic basement at four of these drilling targets. In two cases we targeted larger seamount structures and drilled near the flanks of these ancient volcanoes, and in the other three cases we selected smaller edifices that we drilled closer to their centers. Drilling and logging plans for each of these sites were similar, with coring reaching 522. 0 meters below seafloor (mbsf) for Site U 1374 and 232. 9, 65. 7, 11. 5, 182. 8, and 53. 3 mbsf for Sites U 1372, U 1373, U 1375, U 1376, and U 1377, respectively. Some Expedition 330 drill sites were capped with only a thin layer of <b>pelagic</b> <b>ooze</b> between 6. 6 and 13. 5 m thick, and, if present, these were cored by using a low-rotation gravity-push technique with the rotary core barrel to maximize recovery. However, at Sites U 1373 and U 1376 no <b>pelagic</b> <b>ooze</b> was present, and the holes needed to be started directly into cobble-rich hardgrounds. In all cases, the bulk of the seamount sediment cover comprised sequences of volcanic sandstones and various kinds of basalt breccia or basalt conglomerate, which often were interspersed with basaltic lava flows, the spatter/tephra products of submarine eruptions, or other volcanic products, including auto-brecciated flows or peperites. Also several intervals of carbonate were cored, with the special occurrence of a 15 m thick algallimestone reef at Site U 1376 on Burton Guyot. In addition, some condensed pelagic limestone units were recovered on three of the other seamounts, but these did not exceed 30 cm in thickness. Despite their limited presence in the drilled sediment, these limestones provide valuable insights for the paleoclimate record at high 50 Â° southern latitudes since Mesozoic times. Several Louisville sites progressed from subaerial conditions in the top of volcanic basement into submarine eruptive environments, or drilling of the igneous basement immediately started in submarine volcanic sequences, as was the case for Sites U 1376 and U 1377 on Burton and Hadar Guyots. At three sites we cored > 100 m into the igneous basement: 187. 3 m at Site U 1372, 505. 3 m at Site U 1374, and 140. 9 m at Site U 1376. At the other sites we did not core into basement (Site U 1375) or we cored only 38. 2 m (Site U 1377) because of unstable hole conditions. Even so, drilling during Expedition 330 resulted in a large number of in situ lava flows, pillow basalts, or other types of volcanicproducts such as auto-brecciated lava flows, intrusive sheets or dikes, and peperites. In particular, the three holes on Canopus and Rigil Guyots (the two oldest seamounts drilled in the Louisville Seamount Trail), resulted in adequate numbers of in situ lava flows to average out paleosecular variation, with probable eruption ages estimated at 78 and 73 Ma, respectively. Remarkably, at all drill sites large quantities of hyaloclastites, volcanic sandstones, and basaltic breccias were also recovered, which in many cases show consistent paleomagnetic inclinations compared to the lava flows bracketing these units. For Site U 1374 on Rigil Guyot we also observed a magnetic polarity reversal in the cored sequence. Overall, this is very promising for determining a reliable paleolatitude record for the Louisville Seamounts following detailed postcruise examinations. The deeper penetrations of several hundred meters required bit changes and reentries using free-fall funnels. Basement penetration rates were 1. 8 â€“ 2. 5 m/h depending on drill depth. In total, 1114 m of sediment and igneous basement at five seamounts was drilled, and 806 m was recovered (average recovery = 72. 4...|$|E

40|$|Hardgrounds and {{omission}} {{surfaces are}} {{rare in the}} predominantly pelagic and hemi-pelagic chalk, chert and phosphorite lithofacies association that forms the Upper Cretaceous (Coniacian to Maastrichtian) Belqa Group succession in central Jordan. However, newly-described hardgrounds of regional extent {{at the base of}} the Dhiban Chalk Member (Campanian) in central and south Jordan reveal a complex history of sedimentation and early diagenesis. Following drowning of the Turonian carbonate platform during the Coniacian, the chalk-chert-phosphorite association was deposited on a pelagic ramp in fluctuating water depths. The Mujib Chalk and Dhiban Chalk members represent high-stand sea levels, separated by a regressive, lowstand chert-rich unit (Tafilah Member). Hardground successions can be traced over 100 km, and show an early diagenetic history of phosphatisation and biogenic silica lithification from opal-A to opal-CT and quartz that resulted in penecontemporaneous chert deformation, followed by submarine bioerosion and colonisation by corals and/or bivalves. Subsequent deposition of detrital, remanié phosphatic chalk passing up into <b>pelagic</b> coccolith-rich <b>ooze</b> reflects a transgressive third-order sea-level rise during the Early Campanian. These events provide a time-frame for early silica diagenesis and subsequent hardground development.

40|$|Pore {{fluid and}} {{sediment}} Li concentrations and isotopic ratios {{provide important insights}} on the hydrology, sediment contribution to the arc volcanoes and fluid-sediment reactions at the dominantly non-accretionary Costa Rica subduction zone. Ocean Drilling Program Site 1039 in the trench axis provides a reference section of 400 m of the incoming sediments, and Site 1040, situated arcward from the trench, consists of a deformed sedimentary wedge and apron sediments, the décollement, and the partially dewatered underthrust sediment section. At the reference site, pore fluids show important isotopic variations (delta 6 Li=- 21. 7 to - 37. 8 per mil), reflecting the interplay of in situ alteration of volcanic material and ion exchange with clay minerals. In the basal section, a reversal of Li concentration and delta 6 Li toward seawater values is observed, providing supporting evidence for a lateral seawater flow system in the upper oceanic basement underlying this sediment section. At Site 1040, pore fluid of the lower deformed wedge sediments and within the décollement is enriched in Li and the isotopic compositions are relatively light, suggesting infiltration of a deep-seated fluid. The delta 6 Li value of - 22 per mil of this Li-enriched fluid (261 µM), {{when compared with the}} delta 6 Li value of the subducted sediment section (- 11 per mil), suggests that the deep source fluid originates from mineral fluid dehydration and transformation reactions at temperatures of 100 to 150 °C, consistent with the temperature range of the up-dip seismogenic zone and of transformation of smectite to illite. The distribution of Li and its isotopes in the underthrust section are similar to those at the reference site, indicating near complete subduction of the incoming sediments and that early dewatering of the underthrust sediments occurs predominantly by lateral flow into the ocean. The hemipelagic clay-rich sediment section of the subducting plate carries most of the Li into this subduction zone, and the pelagic diatomaceous and nannofossil calcareous oozes contain little Li. The Li isotopes of both the clay-rich hemipelagic sediments and of the <b>pelagic</b> <b>oozes</b> are, however, similar, with delta 6 Li values of - 9 to - 12 per mil. The observations that (1) the delta 6 Li values of the underthrust sediments are distinctly lower than that of the mantle, and (2) the lavas of the Costa Rican volcanoes are enriched in Li and 7 Li, provide an approximation of the contribution of the subducted sediments to the arc volcanoes. A first order mass balance calculation suggests that approximately half of the Li flux delivered by subducted sediments and altered oceanic crust into the Middle American Trench is recycled to the Costa Rican arc and at most a quarter of sedimentary Li is returned into the ocean through thrust faults, primarily the décollement thrust...|$|R
40|$|Interaction between young basaltic {{crust and}} {{seawater}} near the oceanic speading centers {{is one of}} the important processes affecting the chemical composition of the oceanic layer. The formation of metalliferous hydrothermal sediments results from this interaction. The importance of the interaction between seawater and basalt in determining the chemical composition of pore waters from sediments is well known. The influence of mineral solutions derived from this interaction on ocean water composition and the significant flux of some elements (e. g., Mn) are reported by Lyle (1976), Bogdanov et al. (1979), and others. Metal-rich sediments found in active zones of the ocean basins illustrate the influence of seawater-basalt interaction and its effect on the sedimentary cover in such areas. The role of hydrothermal activity and seawater circulation in basalts with regard to global geochemistry cycles has recently been demonstrated by Edmond, Measures, McDuff, McDuff et al. (1979), and Edmond, Measures, Mangum (1979). In the area of the Galapagos Spreading Center the interaction of sediments and solutions derived from interaction of seawater and basalt has resulted in the formation of hydrothermal mounds.
