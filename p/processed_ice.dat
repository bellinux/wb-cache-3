Using ISAAC at the VLT to obtain spectra around 4. 65 m we have detected for the first time “XCN ” and CO ice in an extragalactic environment: the nuclear region of the nearby dusty starburst/AGN galaxy NGC 4945. The profile of the solid CO band reveals the importance of thermal processing of the ice while the prominence of the XCN band attests to the importance of energetic processing of the ice by FUV radiation and/or energetic particles. In analogy to the processing of ices by embedded protostars in our Galaxy, we attribute the processing of the ices in the center of NGC 4945 to ongoing massive star formation. Our M-band spectrum also shows strong HI Pf and H 2 0 – 0 S(9) line emission and gas phase CO absorption lines. The HI, H 2, PAH, gas phase CO and the ices seem to be embedded in a rotating molecular disk which is undergoing vigorous star formation. Recently, strong OCN − absorption has been detected in the spectrum of the Galactic center star GC: IRS 19. The most likely environment for the OCN − absorption is the strongly UV-exposed GC molecular ring.

40|$|IC 5146 is {{a nearby}} (200 pc) dark cloud complex in Cygnus. The lack of star {{formation}} activity makes it an excellent laboratory {{for the study of}} the chemical complexity in the earliest stages of dense molecular cloud evolution. We have used the Spitzer Infrared Spectrometer (IRS) to probe dust along 10 sight-lines toward K-Giant background stars, sampling a range of visual extinction from 2 - 20 mag. Here we present 5 - 20 micron spectra and correlation studies of the 6. 0 micron water-ice band and 9. 7 micron silicate absorption band with Av for a sample of our Spitzer program sources. Our IC 5146 Spitzer data indicate grain growth and ice formation occurs early in the history of dense cloud formation. Each sight-line observed reveals the 9. 7 micron amorphous silicate absorption band. The highest Av sightlines show clear detections of ices at 6. 0 micron (water-ice mixture), 6. 85 micron (<b>processed</b> <b>ice)</b> and 15. 2 micron (CO 2). However, sight-lines in the low-to-mid Av range provide intriguing variations. We may have the first example of two objects, one with ice features and one without, seen through the same cloud sightline with similar Av approx. 6 and similar silicate band optical depths. Also, the nominally expected linear correlation of Av with silicate band depth does not appear to hold for this cloud (turnover at Av approx. 10 - 12). Both trends imply complexities in the grain growth at one of the earliest stages of dust and ice interaction ever observed. The highest extinction source in our sample, Av= 20, reveals the 6. 0 micron (water), 6. 85 micron (<b>processed</b> <b>ice),</b> 9. 7 micron silicate and 15. 2 micron CO 2 ice bands. Until recently, the 6. 85 micron band had only been detected towards embedded protostellar objects. Two additional quiescent dust sightlines from the C 2 D results now also indicate the 6. 85 micron band (Taurus and Serpens) by Knez et al. 2005, demonstrating the role of energetic processing within pristine ices prior to the onset {{of star formation}}...|$|E

40|$|The active south polar {{surface of}} Enceladus {{is exposed to}} strong {{chemical}} processing by direct interaction with charged plasma and energetic particles in the local magnetospheric environment of this icy moon. Chemical oxidation activity is suggested by detection of H 202 at the surface in this region and less directly by substantial presence of C 02, CO, and N 2 in the plume gases. Molecular composition of the uppermost surface, including ejecta from plume activity, is radiolytically transformed mostly by penetrating energetic electrons with lesser effects from more depleted populations of energetic protons. The main sources of molecular plasma ions and E-ring dust grains in the magnetospheric environment are the cryovolcanic plume emissions from Enceladus. These molecular ions and the dust grains are chemically processed by magnetospheric interactions that further impact surface chemistry on return to Enceladus. For example, H 20 neutrals dominating the emitted plume gas return to the surface mostly as H 30 + ions after magnetospheric processing. Surface oxidant loading is further increased by return of radiolytically <b>processed</b> <b>ice</b> grains from the E-ring. Plume frost deposition and micrometeoroid gardening protect some fraction of newly produced molecular species from destruction by further irradiation. The evident horizontal and vertical mobility of surface ices in the south polar region drive mixing of these processed materials into the moon interior with potential impacts on deep ice molecular chemistry and plume gas production. Similarly as suggested previously for Europa, the externally driven source of radiolytic oxidants could affect evolution of life in any subsurface liquid water environments of Enceladus...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} I present new K and L ′-band {{infrared}} photometry and 2 - 4 µm spectra of ten Class I and flat spectrum stars forming within the Taurus dark cloud complex. Nine sources have H 2 v= 0 - 1 S(1) emission, and some show multiple H 2 emission features in their K-band spectra. Photospheric absorptions characteristic to low mass stars are detected {{in five of}} the targets, and these stars were fit with models to determine spectral type, infrared accretion excess veiling (rK and rL ′) and dust temperatures, estimates of visual extinction and characteristics of the 3 µm water-ice absorption. On average, the models found high extinction values, infrared accretion excess emission with blackbody temperatures in the 900 - 1050 K range, and 3 µm absorption profiles best fit by water frozen onto cold grains rather than thermally <b>processed</b> <b>ice.</b> Five techniques were used to estimate the extinction toward the stellar photospheres; most gave vastly different results. Analysis of emission line ratios suggests that the effect of infrared scattered light toward some protostars should not be neglected. For stars that exhibited Brγ in emission, accretion luminosities were estimated using relations between Lacc and Brγ luminosity. The young stars in this sample were preferentially chosen as variables, but {{they do not have the}} accretion dominated luminosities necessary to put them in their main stage of mass-building. The characteristics of the 2 - 4 µm spectra are placed in the context of existing multi-wavelength data, and five of the stars are catagorized as reddened Class IIs or stars in transition between Class I and II, rather than protostars embedded within massive remnant envelopes...|$|E
40|$|The distribution, {{chemical}} structure, and {{formation of}} organic matter in the interstellar medium are important {{to our understanding of}} the overall evolution of dust. The exchange of dust between the dense and diffuse interstellar medium, and the effects of processing on dust within dense clouds will affect the inventory of material available for incorporation into newly forming star and planetary systems. Observational ground-based studies have confirmed the widespread distribution of the 3. 4 pm absorption band attributed to aliphatic hydrocarbons in the diffuse interstellar medium of our own galaxy, and in the dusty spectra of a few nearby galaxies, while space based observations from IS 0 probed the signatures of corresponding mid-infrared features. Laboratory experiments which utilize both thermal processes and energetic processing by high energy photons and cosmic rays, produce candidate materials which offer close matches to the observed diffuse interstellar medium and extragalactic hydrocarbon absorption features. Through an analysis of the 4000 to 1000 cm (2. 5 to 10 micrometers) region of the spectrum of diffuse interstellar medium (DISM) dust compared with the spectra of thirteen chemical entities produced in the laboratory which serve as analogs to the interstellar material, significant constraints have been placed on the applicability of proposed candidate materials to explain the interstellar features. The results indicate that the organic refractory material in the diffuse interstellar medium is predominantly hydrocarbon in nature, possessing little nitrogen or oxygen, with the carbon distributed between the aromatic and aliphatic forms. Long alkane chains H 3 C-(CH 2),- with n much greater than 4 or 5 are not major constituents of this material. Comparisons to laboratory analogs indicate the DISM organic material resembles plasma processed pure hydrocarbon residues much more so than energetically <b>processed</b> <b>ice</b> residues. This result is consistent with a birthsite for the carrier of the 3. 4 micrometers band in the outflow region of evolved carbon stars. Comparisons of dust from our own galaxy with that of distant galaxies suggests that the organic component of interstellar dust is widespread and may be an important universal reservoir of prebiotic organic carbon...|$|E

40|$|A high-resolution, {{two-dimensional}} {{numerical model}} {{is used to}} study the moisture redistribution following homogeneous ice nucleation induced by Kelvin waves in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL). We compare results for dry/moist initial conditions and three levels of complexity for the representation of cloud processes: complete microphysics and cloud radiative effects, likewise but without radiative effects, and instantaneous removal of moisture in excess of saturation upon nucleation. Cloud evolution and moisture redistribution {{are found to be}} sensitive to initial conditions and cloud <b>processes.</b> <b>Ice</b> sedimentation leads to a downward flux of water, whereas the cloud radiative heating induces upward advection of the cloudy air. The latter results in an upward (downward) flux of water vapour if the cloudy air is moister (drier) than the environment, which is typically when the environment is subsaturated (supersaturated). Only a fraction (~ 25 % or less) of the cloud experiences nucleation. Post-nucleation <b>processes</b> (<b>ice</b> depositional growth, sedimentation, and sublimation) are important to cloud morphology, and both dehydrated and hydrated layers may be indicators of TTL cirrus occurrence. The calculation with instantaneous removal of moisture not only misses the hydration but also underestimates dehydration due to (i) nucleation before reaching the minimum saturation mixing ratio, and (ii) lack of moisture removal from sedimenting ice particles below the nucleation level. The sensitivity to initial conditions and cloud processes suggests {{that it is difficult to}} reach generic, quantitative estimates of cloud-induced moisture redistribution on the basis of case-by-case calculations...|$|R
