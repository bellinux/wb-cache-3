40|$|In the {{automotive}} industry, {{natural gas is}} currently stored as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) in cylindrical high-pressure tanks. In order to increase the range of vehicles, a more efficient use of the available design space is needed. For this purpose the Institute of Vehicle Concepts at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) is developing an innovative, lightweight, composite-intensive design for a high-pressure tank: "The DLR Modular-Free-Shapeable CNG Tank". The new manufacturing process, combined with the tank concept, leads to a volume gain of up to 38 % compared to conventional CNG storage systems, based on the available space in the vehicle. However, a new winding process has to be developed for this tank. This paper shows {{the results of the}} <b>polar</b> <b>winding</b> of non-rotationally-symmetrical vessels, complexity of the domes and the first tool for the 3 D-Winding-System. The German Aerospace Center Institute of Vehicle Concepts is working on the first automated produced prototypes that can be scaled to an industrial level so that a low-cost, shape adaptable CNG tank is possible. With this storage system, CNG vehicles can gain a larger range, further the environment and society will gain an added value because of lower emissions than petrol and diesel, while by using synthetic methane it is possible to reach an emission free mobility...|$|E

First, the linear instabilities associated with an O(+) and H(+) <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> plasma in the presence of O(+) and H(+) beams for a range of O(+) /H(+) beam densities, T(sub e) /T(sub i), and ion beam speeds were examined. Then, nonlinear heating of the <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> ions was studied, using numerical simulations. The O(+) and H(+) <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> ions were modeled by isotropic Maxwellian distributions, and the electrons, O(+) beams, and H(+) beams were modeled by drifting Maxwellian distributions. The effects of the kinetic ion heating on the outflow of the <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> ions were examined from the ionosphere, using a time-dependent hydrodynamic model. A numerical code to solve the O(+) and H(+) continuity and momentum equations in a flux tube from ionospheric to magnetospheric altitudes were developed. The effects of ion heating were included by allowing for the altitudinal variation of the ion temperatures in the momentum equation. The ion temperature profiles were specified based on the ion heating characteristics found from previous kinetic simulations. It was assumed that heating occurred above 1500 km and increased to a saturated value of temperature that was obtained directly from the kinetic simulation study. The characteristics of the dynamical <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> without ion heating were studied, and a flux tube on closed field lines that suddenly became open at t = 0 was simulated. Then, the effects of ion heating were included. To gain some physical insight, two limiting cases were considered: preferential H(+) heating and preferential O(+) heating.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the kinetic ion heating of the <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> on the dynamic {{expansion}} of the <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> outflow is investigated by incorporating the kinetic ion heating effect into a time-dependent hydrodynamic <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> model in which the <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> O(+) and H(+) continuity and momentum equations are solved in a flux tube from ionospheric to magnetospheric altitudes. Two limiting cases were considered: (1) preferential O(+) escape and (2) preferential H(+) heating. It was found that ion heating does not have much effect on the escape of H(+) ions because of the limiting nature of the H(+) escape fluxes. However, O(+) heating can substantially increase the upward O(+) pressure gradient in the heating region, indicating that O(+) heating is a viable explanation for the unexpectedly large O(+) fluxes frequently observed in the polar magnetosphere...|$|R

The <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> {{is found to be}} O(+) dominated for the full altitude range considered (up to 8 R(E)). Multiple solutions are obtained for various combinations of base altitude ion temperatures and electron temperatures, such that the densities fit the Persoon et al. (1983) profile.

40|$|The higher-order generalizations of the {{equations}} of standard hydrodynamics, known collectively as generalized transport theories, {{have been used}} since the early 1980 s to describe the terrestrial <b>polar</b> <b>wind.</b> Inherent {{in the structure of}} generalized transport theories is the ability to describe not only interparticle collisions but also certain non-Maxwellian processes, such as heat flow and viscous stress, that are characteristic of any plasma flow that is not collision dominated. Because the <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> exhibits a transition from collision-dominated to collisionless flow, generalized transport theories possess advantages for <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> modeling not shared by either collision-dominated models (such as standard hydrodynamics) or collisionless models (such as those based on solving the collisionless Boltzmann equation). In general, previous <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> models have used generalized transport equations to describe electrons and only one species of ion (H(+)). If other ion species were included in the models at all, it was in a simplified or semiempirical manner. The model described in this paper is the first <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> model that uses a generalized transport theory (bi-Maxwellian-based 16 -moment theory) to describe all of the species, both major and minor, in the <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> plasma.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the Arctic climate has changed {{markedly}} over the past 25 years. Unfortunately, two major reanalysis products that can be used for studying recent changes exhibit relatively large errors in the wind field over the Arctic where there is little radiosonde data available for assimilation. At least ten numerical weather prediction centers worldwide have demonstrated that satellite-derived <b>polar</b> <b>winds</b> have a positive impact on global weather forecasts. The impact on reanalyses should be similar. Therefore, a <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> data set spanning more than 20 years was generated using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data. This paper focuses on the winds generated over the Arctic. Comparisons with winds from collocated radiosondes show good agreement over the Arctic, with relatively small biases in the AVHRR-derived winds of 0. 1 – 0. 8 m s- 1, depending on the level. In addition, AVHRR <b>polar</b> <b>winds</b> have lower speed root-mean-squared errors and speed biases than reanalysis winds when compared to rawinsondes that were not assimilated into the reanalysis. We also show that frequently the AVHRR winds are faster in jet streams than what the reanalysis depicts. The results from this study could lead to a better dynamical understanding of the deficiencies on the reanalysis products over the Arctic region. It is recommended that the historical AVHRR <b>polar</b> <b>winds</b> dataset be included in future reanalysis efforts...|$|R
40|$|The {{temporal}} {{characteristics of}} the <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> were studied with both {{a full set of}} hydrodynamic equations and a simplified set of collisionless equations. The hydrodynamic set contained continuity, momentum and energy equations for H+, O+ and electrons, including collisional conductivities and variable, but isotropic, ion and electron temperatures. The collisionless model included the same species and was able to take account of constant anisotropic ion temperatures. The two <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> models were solved with different numerical techniques and the results were compared for similar expansion scenarios. In particular, the temporal evolution of the <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> was modelled for initial, extended density depletions of factors of 3, 10 and 100 starting at several altitudes. Also, the two models were used to study the temporal response of the <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> to varying electron temperature conditions. From this comparative study, we found the following: (1) qualitatively, the two models predict the same temporal characteristics for the <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> densities, flow velocities, and escape fluxes; (2) the propagation velocities of the disturbances vary markedly with the level of the depletion, with greater depletions producing greater disturbance velocities; (3) for small depletions the H+ disturbance does not steepen into a shock; (4) the rapidly moving H+ disturbances do not significantly affect the O+ distribution, but the slower moving O+ shocks generate secondary H+ disturbances that propagate with the heavy ion shock waves; (5) for a 100 fold depletion, the rapid acceleration of the minor H+ ions through the O+ shock acts to enhance the H+ density at higher altitudes {{to such an extent that}} H+ becomes the dominant ion over a limited altitude range ahead of the O+ shock; (6) the adiabatic cooling associated with the upward propagation of the disturbances leads to a significant reduction in the O+ temperature, and a less dramatic reduction in the H+ temperature; and (7) the <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> expansion characteristics are strongly modulated when the electron temperature variations are of the order of five minutes. The density distribution becomes highly structured, and regions of upward and downward ion flows follow the temporal variations of Te. Such a situation can occur when the interplanetary magnetic field is northward and the magnetospheric convection pattern is turbulent...|$|R
