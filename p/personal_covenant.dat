25|$|Orthodox Judaism {{also notes}} that the Torah {{was never meant to}} be {{observed}} as a <b>personal</b> <b>covenant</b> between the individual Jew and God, but a national covenant wherein the Torah functions as the constitution of Israel as a whole. Orthodox Jews point out that the Torah could never be enforced as a national law, as it was during the time of Joshua, King David, and Ezra, if every individual Jew had their own opinion on how to observe its commandments. In order for the Torah to properly govern the Jewish people, and for its laws be legally enforced with the punishments and penalties prescribed in the Torah, those laws must be legislated and clearly defined by a ruling Sanhedrin. Karaites counter that the enforcement of the Torah on a national scale can only be legislated by the descendants of Zadok in the Temple in Jerusalem as per the Torah (Deuteronomy 17) and prophets (Ezekiel 44) not by a collection of opinions by various rabbis.|$|E

2500|$|The {{instructional}} and testing {{phase of the}} endowment consisted of a scripted reenactment of Adam and Eve's experience in the Garden of Eden (performed by live actors called officiators; in the mid-20th century certain portions were adapted to a film presentation). The instruction is punctuated with <b>personal</b> <b>covenants,</b> gestures, and a prayer circle around an altar. At the end of instruction, the initiate's knowledge of symbolic gestures and key-words is tested at a [...] "veil", a symbolic final frontier for the initiate to face the judgement of Jesus, before entering the presence of God in the celestial kingdom.|$|R
5000|$|Endowment: Referred to {{as a gift}} of [...] "power from on high" [...] by Joseph Smith, {{the purpose}} and meaning of the {{endowment}} varied during his lifetime. After 1842, the endowment usually consists of two phases: (1) an initiation, and (2) an instructional and testing phase. The initiation consisted of the washing and anointing, culminating in the clothing of the patron in a [...] "Garment of the Holy Priesthood".

5000|$|Descriptions of Divine immanence {{can be seen}} in Nigleh, {{from the}} Bible to Rabbinic Judaism. In Genesis, God makes a <b>personal</b> <b>covenant</b> with the forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Daily Jewish prayers refer to this {{inherited}} closeness and personal relationship with the Divine, for their descendants, as [...] "the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob". To Moses, God reveals his Tetragrammaton name, that more fully captures Divine descriptions of transcendence. Each of the Biblical names for God, describe different Divine manifestations. The most important prayer in Judaism, that forms part of the Scriptural narrative to Moses, says [...] "Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One." [...] This declaration combines different Divine names, and themes of immanence and transcendence. Perhaps the most personal example of a Jewish prayer that combines both themes is the invocation repeatedly voiced during the time in the Jewish calendar devoted to Teshuva (Return, often inaccurately translated as Repentance), Avinu Malkeinu ("Our Father, Our King"). Much of the later Hebrew Biblical narrative recounts the reciprocal relationship and national drama of the unfolding of themes of immanence and transcendence. Kabbalistic, or Hasidic Jewish thought and philosophy describe and articulate these interconnected aspects of the Divine-human relationship.|$|E
40|$|Oaths {{of office}} are {{required}} by the second and sixth articles of the United States Constitution. The oath for judges, however, has been a bit different from the very beginning. Recent discussion in this journal has again raised the perennial questions {{of the role of}} the oaths, and the degree to which the oaths signal some religious commitment by the Framers, or whether one can see in them any expectation for a religious leadership of the nation. My enterprise is to sketch a bit more of the context that might help shed light on the meaning of these oaths, or at least some of the meanings of these oaths as they would have been understood by a person of the Framer‘s generation. The enterprise here has two significant limits. First, to ascribe universal and specific meanings to something as complex as an oath would be unhelpful, as such meanings are, at best, matters of approximation and of averages among a variety of disparate views. Second, a full discussion of the history of oaths in each colony—as matters of office, of testimony, of <b>personal</b> <b>covenants,</b> etc., arising in each of the European states from which the colonists came—is beyond the scope of this article and, anyway, not the purpose of the editors of de novo. Rather, I here raise a few points of reference, illustrating some of them with a few examples from British, colonial, and early federal history...|$|R
50|$|The word Burgrecht {{is first}} {{used by the}} St. Gall monk Notker the German in about 1000 AD {{to refer to the}} Roman civil law. Later, in the {{southern}} German region, it came to refer to inheritance laws and the rights that were tied to specific castle or town. In the territory, that would become Switzerland, starting in the 13th century, the term Burgrecht began to expand. It grew to mean any agreement between a town with other towns, monasteries, individuals (especially nobles with domination and ownership rights), organizations or <b>personal</b> corporations <b>covenants</b> and agreements that include a citizenship clause. These agreements could be indefinite or limited and renewable. The oath of citizenship with which the Burgrecht was sealed gave this agreement special weight in comparison to other alliances. The Verburgrechteten (those covered by the Burgrecht agreement) were allowed to enjoy, often limited, citizenship privileges including military and court protection was well as market access. The town or city received additional influence outside its borough and better coverage of their markets. The distribution of duties and rights in Burgrecht treaties reflects the power relationship between the parties.|$|R
6000|$|On the whole, the Stevensons may be {{described}} as decent, reputable folk, following honest trades--millers, maltsters, and doctors, playing the character parts in the Waverley Novels with propriety, if without distinction; and to an orphan looking {{about him in the}} world for a potential ancestry, offering a plain and quite unadorned refuge, equally free from shame and glory. John, the land-labourer, is the one living and memorable figure, and he, alas! cannot possibly be more near than a collateral. It was on August 12, 1678, that he heard Mr. John Welsh on the Craigdowhill, and [...] "took the heavens, earth, and sun in the firmament that was shining on us, as also the ambassador who made the offer, and the clerk who raised the psalms, to witness that I did give myself away to the Lord in a <b>personal</b> and perpetual <b>covenant</b> never to be forgotten"; and already, in 1675, the birth of my direct ascendant was registered in Glasgow. So that I have been pursuing ancestors too far down; and John the land-labourer is debarred me, and I must relinquish from the trophies of my house his rare soul-strengthening and comforting cordial. It is the same case with the Edinburgh bailie and the miller of the Canonmills, worthy man! and with that public character, Hugh the Under-Clerk, and more than all, with Sir Archibald, the physician, who recorded arms. And I am reduced to a family of inconspicuous maltsters in what was then the clean and handsome little city on the Clyde.|$|R
