50|$|The hair <b>perforation</b> <b>test,</b> {{also known}} as an in vitro hair <b>perforation</b> <b>test,</b> is a {{laboratory}} test used to help distinguish the isolates of dermatophytes, such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes and its variants. The test is performed by placing an organism into a petri dish containing water, yeast extract, and hair. The Mayo Clinic's mycology laboratory has identified five common dermatophytes; Microsporum gypseum, Microsporum canis, Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Trichophyton tonsurans.|$|E
5000|$|Microsporum canis {{produces}} infections of {{scalp and}} body sites, creating highly inflammatory lesions associated with hair loss. Infection by this species {{can often be}} detected clinically using Wood's lamp, which causes infected tissues to fluoresce bright green Fluorescence is attributed to metabolite pteridine, which is produced by the fungus in actively growing hairs. Infected hairs remain fluorescent for prolonged periods of time (over the years), even {{after the death of}} the fungus. Despite the frequent use of Wood's lamp in the clinical evaluation of ringworm infections, diagnosis of M. canis requires the performance of additional tests given the potential for false positives. Culture of the fungus is most commonly used to evaluate morphological and physiological parameters of growth, and confirm the identity of the agent. Growth of the fungus on Sabouraud's agar (4% glucose), Mycosel or rice medium characteristically yields the bright yellow pigment. Microscopic examination of the growth can show the presence of the typical, warted and spindle-shaped macroconidia, confirming the identity of the isolate as M. canis. The In vitro hair <b>perforation</b> <b>test,</b> commonly used to differentiate many dermatophytes, is not particularly useful for this species as it reveals the formation of [...] "pegs" [...] that penetrate into hair shafts - a characteristic shared widely among many zoophilic species. Genetic analyses can be useful to establish the identity of atypical strains of M. canis; however the highly characteristic appearance of this species generally obviates the need for this more sophisticated method.|$|E
50|$|In {{preparing}} {{samples for}} diagnosis, a scraping {{of the skin}} from the active border of infection is taken, and is inoculated directly onto the test medium. Trichophyton verrucosum is auxotrophic for inositol and thiamine, and as such can be distinguished from other dermatophytes by observing strong growth on Trichophyton agar 3 (a medium rich in thiamine and inositol) and none to weak growth on Trichophyton agars 1 and 2 (deficient in these nutrients). It will also grow on Sabouraud agar, but only {{with the addition of}} yeast extract (which provides the inositol and thiamine it requires). In Bromocresol purple (BCP) milk solids glucose agar, a medium used to distinguish the dermatophytes from bacteria and other organisms by evaluating ammonium production during proteolysis, T. verrucosum produces a weakly alkaline result (faint purple) and clearing of milk solids with a characteristic halo on the periphery. Negative test results occur for the urease test, hair <b>perforation</b> <b>test,</b> and casamino acids erythritol albumin agar. In conjunction to physiological tests, contact with cattle should also be used as a criterion due to the zoophilic and occupational nature of the disease. Otherwise, misdiagnosis as pyoderma or bacterial folliculitis can occur, with the prescribed antibacterial treatment having no effect. Indeed, one study found that people infected with T. verrucosum had to visit a physician on average of 2.5 times, with 25 days elapsing, before a proper diagnosis was obtained. This may lead to an underestimation of the true number of cases, as many people will recover from the disease before obtaining a proper diagnosis. Looking at the stratum corneum under a microscope may also aid in diagnosis, which is done by adding 10% KOH solution and a Periodic acid-Schiff stain. Swollen chlamydospores 5-10 μm in diameter will appear outside the hair shaft, while skin samples will have swollen spores mixed with dermatophyte filaments.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{mechanical}} behaviour of the aluminium alloy 2024 -T 3. This alloy has particular relevance since it is widely used in the aeronautical industry for building aircraft structures. The deformation behaviour of this material has been characterised in tension under wide ranges of strain rate and temperature. Among the aluminium alloys, the AA 2024 -T 3 highlights due to its high flow stress and strain hardening. Moreover, the material temperature sensitivity has been found dependent on plastic strain. The Modified Rusinek-Klepaczko constitutive description [Rusinek A, Rodriguez-Martinez JA, Arias A. A thermo-viscoplastic constitutive model for FCC metals with application to OFHC copper. Int. J. Mech. Sci. 52 (2010) 120 - 135], which takes into account such dependence of the temperature sensitivity on plastic strain, has been applied for modelling the thermo-viscoplastic response of the material. Satisfactory agreement between experiments and analytical predictions provided by the Modified Rusinek-Klepaczko model has been found. In order to study the material behaviour under impact loading, low velocity <b>perforation</b> <b>tests</b> on AA 2024 -T 3 sheets have been performed at different initial temperatures using a drop weight tower.

40|$|Dermatophytes are keratinolytic fungi {{responsible}} for a large variety of diseases that can affect glabrous skin, nails and hair. In many cases, the diagnosis is not clinically obvious, and mycological analysis is required. This includes both direct microscopic examination and cultures. First of all, clinical specimens have to be sampled according to localization and characteristics of the lesions. Direct microscopic examination is usually performed using clearing reagents (KOH or Amman’s chloral-lactophenol), but its sensitivity may be greatly enhanced {{by the use of}} stains or fluorochromes such as Congo red or Calcofluor white. Histological analysis is an efficient method, but it is constraining for the patients and, as direct examination, it does not allow precise identification of the pathogen. Cultures are therefore needed, and specific culture media may be used to overcome the growth of rapidly growing contaminating moulds which may hamper the recovery of dermatophytes. Identification at the species level which may be useful to initiate an appropriate treatment or for setting prophylactic measures, relies on macroscopic and microscopic morphology.

40|$|A damage {{variable}} (damage degree DD) {{representing the}} ratio between the absorbed {{energy and the}} impact energy was introduced in 1998 by Belingardi and Vadori to assess damage accumulation caused by low velocity impacts. More recently, repeated impact tests carried out on thick laminates pointed out the significance and extent of the penetration process in thick laminates, which the DD is unable to monitor as, by definition, it reaches the value of one at penetration to remain unchanged over the entire penetration process. In the present paper, a new damage variable (damage index DI) is proposed to overcome shortcomings of the DD with respect to thick laminates. By introducing the displacement of the impactor into {{the definition of the}} DI, the depth of the penetration process is taken into account. Normalization by the displacement of the quasi-static <b>perforation</b> <b>test</b> allows for a non-dimensional damage variable which is shown to reach the value of one at perforation. Validity of the approach is proven against impact data obtained for different fibre-matrix architectures and laminate thickness. Results show that the DI can effectively differentiate between penetration and perforation thresholds, increasing monotonically within the range of the penetration process. In particular, the DI is shown to increase linearly with the impact energy up to penetration and to rise quite abruptly within the range of the penetration process. Results for repeated impact tests prove that at first the DI increases quite linearly impact after impact, owing to a steady accumulation of damage. A few impacts before penetration a sudden rise in the DI value points out a change in the rate of damage accumulation...|$|E

DNA was isolated and purified by glass-bead methods and ITS 1 - 5. 8 SrDNA-ITS 2 region was amplified by PCR and the amplicon was digested by the restriction enzyme MvaI. The products were visualized after agarose gel electrophoresis and staining. Differentiation of the species was based on sequence analysis and the electrophoretic patterns. Results: Morphological tests were not able to definitely differentiate the two tested species, especially for isolates with intermediate features. Using molecular methods, it was found that 45 isolates are T. rubrum and 54 are T. mentagrophytes. One isolate was Fusarium spp. Physiological tests were confirmed the results except for 4 isolates. It was also found that hair <b>perforation</b> <b>test</b> is more reliable than urease test for differentiation of these two species. Conclusion: We found that DNA-based method, although expensive, is a fast and reliable method for differentiation of T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes. The frequency of mentioned species was almost similar in the tested isolates. The method is recommended for differentiation of other dermatophytes...|$|E

This massive inflammatory process led to acute colon <b>perforation.</b> Serological <b>testing</b> demonstrated cytomegalovirus reactivation. Severe immunosuppression caused by primary HIV infection resulted in cytomegalovirus colitis, and initiation of early combination antiretroviral therapy triggered an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome potentially leading to colonic perforatio...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} and analyzes the behaviour of TRIP 1000 steel sheets subjected to low velocity perforation by conical projectiles. The relevance {{of this material}} resides in the potential transformation of retained austenite to martensite during impact loading. This process leads {{to an increase in}} strength and ductility of the material. However, this transformation takes place only under certain loading conditions strongly dependent on the initial temperature and deformation rate. In order to study the material behaviour under impact loading, <b>perforation</b> <b>tests</b> have been performed using a drop weight tower. Experiments were carried out at two different initial temperatures T 0 213 K and T 0 288 K, and within the range of impact velocities 2. 5 m/s 6 V 0 6 4. 5 m/s. The experimental setup enabled the measuring of impact velocity, residual velocity, load time history and failure mode. In addition, dry and lubricated contacts between the striker and the plate have been investigated. Finally, by using X ray diffraction {{it has been shown that}} no martensitic transformation takes place during the perforation process. The causes involving the none appearance of martensite are examined...|$|R
