5|$|Registrations {{of super}} clean cars {{increased}} five-fold in July 2014 {{driven by the}} end of the quota of 5,000 new cars eligible for the super clean car subsidy. A total of 4,656 plug-in super clean <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> were registered in 2014, representing a 1.53% market share of new <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> registered in the country in 2014. Registrations of super clean cars were up 201% from 2013, while registrations of new <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> increased 12.7%. The top selling plug-in electric cars in 2014 were the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV with 2,289 units and the Volvo V60 PHEV with 745. A total of 8,908 light-duty plug-in electric vehicles were registered in 2015, up 80% from 2014. The registered stock consisted of 5,625 plug-in hybrids, 2,962 all-electric cars and 321 all-electric utility vans. The plug-in segment had a market share of 2.49% of new car sales in 2015. The Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV was the top selling plug-in car for a second year running with 3,302 units, followed by the Tesla Model S with 996 units.|$|E

5|$|Amfleet is a {{fleet of}} single-level {{intercity}} railroad <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> built by the Budd Company for American company Amtrak in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Budd based the Amfleet design on its earlier Metroliner electric multiple unit. An initial order for 57 cars in 1973 to supplement the Metroliners on the Northeast Corridor grew to two orders totaling 642 cars, sufficient to reequip all the services on the Northeast Corridor and many other routes around the United States. The first 492 cars, known as Amfleet I and completed between 1975–1977, were designed for short-distance service. A second order of 150 cars, known as Amfleet II and completed between 1980–1983, were designed for long-distance service. They were the last intercity <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> built by Budd.|$|E

5|$|By 1965, the six <b>{{passenger}}</b> <b>cars</b> of the DRR's Retlaw 1 train, due {{to their}} slow passenger loading and unloading times, began to be phased out of service. In July 1974, the Retlaw 1 <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> were retired and stored in the DRR's roundhouse, except for the Grand Canyon observation coach, which was converted into a parlor car and renamed Lilly Belle after Walt Disney's wife Lillian. The Lilly Belle was given a new exterior paint scheme and a new interior, which included varnished mahogany paneling, velour curtains and seats, a floral-patterned wool rug, and Disney family pictures framed and hung on the walls. The first official passenger to come aboard the Lilly Belle after its conversion into a parlor car in September 1975 was Japanese Emperor Hirohito, and since then it can be regularly seen coupled {{on the ends of}} the DRR's trains. In 1996, rail collector Bill Norred acquired the five other Retlaw 1 <b>passenger</b> <b>cars.</b> Norred died two years later, and in 1999 his family sold the four coaches of the former Retlaw 1 passenger train to Rob Rossi, owner of the Pacific Coast Railroad located within Santa Margarita Ranch in Santa Margarita, California, leaving only the Retlaw 1 combine car in the Norred family's possession. On July 10, 2010, the Norred family sold the Retlaw 1 combine car to the Carolwood Foundation, which restored it and put it on display next to Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn within the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum complex in Los Angeles' Griffith Park.|$|E

To understand the different regional and local strategies of foreign car producers better, the author introduces a classification of FDI in the <b>passenger</b> <b>car</b> industry based on the degree of embeddedness in local economies and relationships to path dependency in the 1990 s. The effects of FDI on selective peripheral integration of parts of CEE into the European car production system, as well as the role of Central Europe in the division of labour in the European <b>passenger</b> <b>car</b> industry, are also considered. ...|$|R

5|$|Although some {{preparatory work}} was carried out, the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939 brought the electrification north of Rickmansworth to a halt. First class travel was abandoned by the LPTB, along with the Pullman cars, and the line was operated entirely as a shuttle service. In 1940 the Chesham branch was converted to autotrain working, in which the trains could be driven from each end, thus avoiding the time-consuming repositioning of the locomotive. LNER C13 Class locomotives were used for this push-pull working, along with two three-car sets of antiquated Ashbury <b>passenger</b> <b>cars</b> dating from 1898.|$|E
