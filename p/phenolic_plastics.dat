50|$|The Diana is a {{very simply}} {{constructed}} box camera with a mechanical film advance, spring-loaded shutter, and a primitive plastic viewfinder. It is constructed primarily of low-quality <b>phenolic</b> <b>plastics</b> of the type commonly found in toys imported from Asia during the 1960s. Because of wide variances in production quality, combined with a poorly designed camera body latching mechanism, Diana cameras are predisposed to light leaks onto the exposed film. If not desired, such leaks can be temporarily remedied by sealing the seams with light-proof tape after loading the film. The design of the Diana incorporates a crude lens that produces an image circle which only marginally covers the diagonal of a film frame. This marginal coverage field produces images with often pronounced vignetting. The poor quality of the plastic meniscus lens results in generally low contrast and resolution, odd color rendition, chromatic aberration, and blurred images. Additionally, the film spool may become loose or out of place when winding the film {{on to the next}} frame. Finally, the crude advance and shutter mechanism can result in images that are not properly centered or exposed.|$|E
40|$|In a {{collaborative}} project between the USDA and Northern Illinois University, {{the use of}} ethanol corn processing by-products as bio-filler materials in the compression molding of <b>phenolic</b> <b>plastics</b> has been studied. This paper reports {{on the results of}} a machinability study in the milling of various grades of this material. Three types of samples were studied: 100 %, 75 % and 50 % phenolic samples. The milling operation was carried out with a fixed depth of cut of 2. 0 mm using a 12. 5 mm diameter two-fluted end-mill. The cutting speed was varied between 120 and 160 m/min at feeds between 200 and 300 mm/min. Surface roughness measurements were taken after each combination of feed and speed. Mathematical models for surface roughness have been developed in terms of speed and feed at constant depth of cut by response surface methodology (RSM); the significance of the speed and feed on the surface roughness has been established with Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for the three types of samples. The optimum cutting conditions were obtained by constructing contours of constant surface roughness using MINITAB statistical software...|$|E

Head took this one step further, using a thicker <b>phenolic</b> <b>plastic</b> sheet and bonding it to the ski along with the other layers.|$|R

Fume hoods were originally manufactured from wood, but during the 1970s and 1980s epoxy powder-coated steel became the norm. During the 1990s, wood pulp derivatives treated with <b>phenolic</b> resin (<b>plastic</b> laminates and solid grade laminates) for chemical resistance and flame spread retardance started to become widely accepted.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Liquefaction {{products}} of bamboo powder {{were obtained by}} using phenol as liquefier and 3 % sulfuric acid as catalyst. Biomass phenolic resin was formed by the reaction of bamboo powder liquefaction product and formaldehyde under alkaline condition. The yield and viscosity of resin prepared under various temperatures and resinification times were studied. The result showed that biomass phenolic resin included 2 - 8 % of tween- 80, 12 - 28 % of p-toluenesulfonic acid, 12 - 28 % of phosphoric acid, and 10 - 20 % of n-pentane. The viscosity measured at the foaming temperature of 70 ℃ was 2000 - 4000 mPa·s. The density of <b>phenolic</b> foam <b>plastic</b> prepared from biomass phenolic resin was 20. 78 - 81. 51 kg/m 3, and the compressive strength was 18 - 57 N/cm 2. Infrared spectroscopic analysis was also conducted on the biomass phenolic resin and phenolic foam...|$|R
5000|$|The fuel {{stored in}} the chamber (bowl) {{can be a problem}} in hot climates. If the engine is shut off while hot, the {{temperature}} of the fuel will increase, sometimes boiling ("percolation"). This can result in flooding and difficult or impossible restarts while the engine is still warm, a phenomenon known as [...] "heat soak". Heat deflectors and insulating gaskets attempt to minimize this effect. The Carter Thermo-Quad carburetor has float chambers manufactured of insulating <b>plastic</b> (<b>phenolic),</b> said to keep the fuel 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius) cooler.|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedIn many {{applications}} of material designing and engineering, high-frequency linear viscoelastic {{properties of materials}} are essential. Traditionally, the high-frequency properties are estimated through the time-temperature superposition (WLF equation) of low-frequency data, which are questionable because the existence of multi-phase in elastomer compounds. Moreover, no reliable data at high frequencies over MHz have been available thus far.; Ultrasound testing is cost-effective for measuring high-frequency properties. Although both ultrasonic longitudinal and shear properties are {{necessary in order to}} fully characterize high-frequency mechanical properties of materials, longitudinal properties will be extensively explored in this thesis. Ultrasonic pulse echo method measures longitudinal properties.; A precision ultrasonic measurement system has been developed in our laboratory, which allows us to monitor the in-situ bulk and/or surface properties of silicate glasses, polymer composites and even hydrogels. The system consists of a pulse-echo unit and an impedance measurement unit. A pulse echo unit is explored mainly.; First, a systematic procedure was developed to obtain precise water wavespeed value. A calibration curve of water wavespeed as a function of temperature has been established, and water wavespeed at 23 °C serves as a yardstick to tell whether or not a setup is properly aligned.; Second, a sound protocol in calculating attenuation coefficient and beam divergence effects was explored using three kinds of silicate glass of different thicknesses.; Then the system was applied to four composite slabs, two slabs for each type of fiberglass reinforced <b>plastics,</b> <b>phenolic</b> and polyester manufactured under different processing conditions: one was made by the normal procedures and the other with deliberate flaws such as voids, tapes and/or prepared at improper operation temperature and pressure. The experiment was conducted under the double blind test protocol. After carefully and methodically analyzing the data, we are able to detect defected specimens from all the specimens supplied to us, differentiate polyester-based composite from the phenolic-based composite and even recognized types of defects.; Lastly, ultrasonic monitoring of advancement of the swollen-unswollen fronts, and hence monitor phase transition from glassy state to rubbery state, of poly(acrylic-acid) hydrogel of one of the three different crosslinking densities is performed. With ultrasonic measurement, swelling monitoring is possible since the structural and mechanical changes during swelling of a dry hydrogel are related to changes in density and elastic constants. Using our carefully developed methodology from previous chapters, we may obtain and monitor average acoustic properties of each layer of hydrogel as it swells...|$|R
