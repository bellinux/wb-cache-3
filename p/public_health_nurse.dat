The mission of FNS {{was to provide}} nurse midwife care for mothers and infants who live in an {{isolated}} area without access to healthcare. Indeed, the Appalachian Mountains of eastern Kentucky where FNS was located {{had some of the}} highest maternal and infant mortality rates in the nation. Statistics on the maternal mortality rate of FNS is significantly lower compared to state- and nationwide data. In the late 1920s, FNS hired renowned statistician Louis Israel Dublin to compile their statistics. He showed that the maternal mortality rate (per 10,000) of FNS between 1925 and 1937 was 6.6 compared to 44 to 53 of Kentucky whites and 48.9 to 69.5 of the United States.|$|E

25|$|Students that {{attend a}} nursing college {{or just a}} nursing school receive the same degree that one would who {{graduated}} from a nursing university, {{but they do not}} have the same educational background. The classes offered at nursing colleges and nursing schools are focused on more practical aspects of nursing. These institutions do not offer many general education classes, so students who attend these schools will solely be focusing on their nursing educations while they are in school. Students who attend a nursing college or school do have the opportunity to become a midwife or a <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>nurse.</b> They have to go through a training institute for their desired field after graduating from the nursing school or college.

[...] One of its goals was instructing its viewers and their families about basic hygiene, [...] "a matter of critical importance {{in an area of}} the world where gastrointestinal diseases abound and infant mortality rates are high". [...] The third season of the show included characters created to [...] "expose young Latin American children to both traditional and nontraditional role models". [...] The producers created characters that demonstrated family diversity, in order to fulfill their curriculum goal of presenting more egalitarian lifestyles by modeling overcoming stereotypes, demonstrating different career options for both men and women, and exhibiting the sharing of household responsibilities. [...] They cast performers in two different families. [...] The first family was more traditional {{and consisted of}} a middle-aged couple named Tono, a mechanic (played by Maurico Herrara), and Alicia, a <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>nurse</b> (Alicia de Bari), who had two children. [...] The adults in the second family were young working professionals; the wife was a veterinarian and the husband was a music teacher who worked from home. [...] Other human characters included: Jose, a shopkeeper and his young assistant, a student named Mercedes (Xochiti Vigil): a truck driver played by Tony Diaz; and a pilot (Fernando Balzaretti), who travelled throughout Latin American and came home to tell his adventures to his friends on the plaza.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide {{understanding}} of the personal practice of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>nurses</b> with their clients, in particular with children within the context of their family. A grounded theory approach was used for the analysis of the data and the generation of a theoretical description and explanation of the way <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>nurses</b> perceive their practice world. Data were gathered through in depth interviews with <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>nurses</b> and were analysed through the method of constant comparative analysis. Enabling choice as a theoretical framework was formulated to describe and assist others to understand the possibilities that <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>nurses</b> aim for in their encounters or relationships with their clients. A number of concepts were identified from the data which contribute to the way <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>nurses</b> work to enable choice for their clients. These include the way nurses become accessible to their clients through a process of becoming known and accepted. The way <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>nurses</b> frame their practice, assess their clients, and use interaction with their clients within an encounter or a relationship is also described within the framework of enabling choice for clients. Metaphors used by the nurses to describe their practice highlighted contradictions related to the influence of the social context. The consequences of the constraints implicit in the social context of community <b>health</b> <b>nursing</b> practice were discussed as they impacted on the ability of the <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>nurses</b> to enable choice for their clients. <b>Public</b> <b>health</b> <b>nursing</b> has not been well documented or understood.

2500|$|There {{are three}} ways that an {{individual}} could become a registered nurse in Japan. After obtaining a high school degree the person {{could go to a}} nursing university for four years and earn a bachelor's degree, go to a junior nursing college for three years or go to a nursing school for three years. [...] Regardless of where the individual attends school they must take the national exam. Those who attended a nursing university have a bit of an advantage over those who went to a nursing school. They can take the national exam to be a registered nurse, <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>nurse</b> or midwife. In the cases of become a midwife or a <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>nurse,</b> the student must take a one-year course in their desired field after attending a nursing university and passing the national exam to become a registered nurse. The nursing universities are the best route for someone who wants to become a nurse in Japan. [...] They offer a wider range of general education classes and they also allow for a more rigid teaching style of nursing. These nursing universities train their students {{to be able to make}} critical and educated decisions when they are out in the field. Physicians are the ones who are teaching the potential nurses because there are not enough available nurses to teach students. This increases the dominance that physicians have over nurses.|$|E
2500|$|Nursing {{was not an}} {{established}} part of Japan's healthcare system until 1899 with the Midwives Ordinance. [...] From there the Registered Nurse Ordinance came into play in 1915. This established a legal substantiation to registered nurses all over Japan. A new law geared towards nurses was created during World War II. This law was titled the <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Nurse,</b> Midwife and Nurse Law and it was established in 1948. It established educational requirements, standards and licensure. There has been a continued effort to improve nursing in Japan. In 1992 the Nursing Human Resource Law was passed. This law created {{the development of new}} university programs for nurses. Those programs were designed to raise the education level of the nurses so that they could be better suited for taking care of the public.|$|E
