40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of the mix {{composition}} on rheological behavior of a mixture is studied by considering a two-phase model for a mixture. A mixture is decomposed into a granular and a <b>paste</b> phase. <b>Paste</b> itself is divided into the void <b>paste</b> and the excess <b>paste.</b> The slump test is used for evaluation of rheological behavior of a mixture. The results show that the granular-cement <b>paste</b> mixtures can be split into three main classes viz Granular-High <b>Paste,</b> Granular-Intermediate <b>Paste</b> and Granular-Low <b>Paste.</b> In Granular-High <b>Paste</b> class, the behavior is governed by the excess <b>paste</b> and the capacity of deformation of mixtures is maximal. In Granular-Low <b>Paste</b> class, the behavior is governed by the void <b>paste</b> and the capacity of deformation of mixtures is minimal. In Granular-Intermediate <b>Paste</b> class the behavior is determined by both the excess <b>paste</b> and the void <b>paste,</b> and the deformability is in between that of the two other extreme cases.

This increase in Bostwick developed over the first month of <b>paste</b> storage at room temperature and could be slowed down but not prevented if the <b>paste</b> was stored at 4 C. Heating the reconstituted <b>paste</b> for 30 min at 90 C or 15 min at 100 C restored the original consistency. Serum viscosities also decreased during <b>paste</b> storage, but the change in serum viscosity was smaller than the changes in Bostwick. As with the Bostwick, heating the reconstituted juice restored the serum viscosity. For a reproducible evaluation of the consistency of stored tomato <b>paste,</b> it is essential that the reconstituted <b>paste</b> be heated to 90 C or above. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Consistency is an important quality consideration in products prepared from reconstituted tomato <b>paste.</b> During storage, changes occur in tomato <b>paste,</b> which affect the consistency after reconstitution.

Harmful solvents for the cleaning of screens and devices after screen-printing of electronic circuits can be substituted by water. In comparison to cleaning agents on organic base the application of water is more cost efficient and leads to more safety in use.

Oscillatory stress sweep test {{are performed to evaluate}} solid characteristic and cohesiveness of the lead-free solder <b>pastes</b> and isotropic conductive adhesive <b>paste</b> materials. The results show that the G' (storage modulus) is higher than G '' (loss modulus) for the <b>pastes</b> material indicating a solid like behaviour. It result shows that the linear visco-elastic region for the <b>pastes</b> lies in a very small stress range, below 10 Pa. in addition, the stress at which the value of storage modulus is equal to that of loss modulus can be used as an indicator of the <b>paste</b> cohesiveness. The measured cross-over stress at G'=G '' shows that the solder <b>paste</b> has higher stress at G'=G '' compared to conductive adhesives. Creep-recovery test method is used to study the slump behaviour in the <b>paste</b> materials.

The rheological characterisation of <b>pastes</b> is an important step in the design and development of new <b>paste</b> formulations. With the ever increasing trend of miniaturisation of electronic products, the study of the rheological properties of solder <b>pastes</b> is becoming an integral part in the R&D of new <b>paste</b> formulations and in the quality monitoring and control during <b>paste</b> manufacture and electronic assembly process. This research work outlines some of the novel techniques which can be successfully used to investigate the rheology of leadfree solder <b>pastes.</b> The report also presents the results of the correlation of rheological properties with solder <b>paste</b> printing performance.
