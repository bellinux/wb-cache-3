40|$|We {{propose that}} {{ambiguity}} aversion, as {{introduced in the}} literature on decision making under uncertainty, drives a <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> established brands in multiattribute choices among branded alternatives. Established brands are those for which belief in quality is held with greater confidence, even if specific attributes might be inferior to those of competing, less-established brands. In five experiments, we examine the role of ambiguity aversion in the <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> dominated, established brands. We first show a correlation between ambiguity aversion (revealed through choices among monetary lotteries) and the <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> established brands. We then show that the <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> established brands is enhanced when ambiguity aversion is made more salient in unrelated preceding lottery choices. Thus, ambiguity aversion carries across choices. In addition, ambiguity aversion and the <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> established brands are both enhanced when subjects anticipate that others will evaluate their lottery choices. Finally, ambiguous information about brand attributes tends to increase the <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> established brands. ambiguity, brand preference, decisions under uncertainty, multiattribute choice...|$|R

5|$|In other respects, {{individual}} countries had different <b>preferences</b> <b>for</b> styles of memorial. French communities usually chose simple monuments, located in public spaces, and deliberately avoided political or religious imagery and rhetoric. In Australia and the US, memorial halls – {{some of which}} were large, grand structures – were popular. Australia also created the idea of an Avenue of Honour, involving lines of trees, with memorial plaques, along a road. Canadians often brought back various material from Europe for their memorials, including pieces of local European churches and soil from the relevant battlefields. Individual countries also had typical national symbols that were widely incorporated, from the British Britannia, to the Gallic rooster to the Romanian vulture. Postcards of war memorials were widely produced in Britain and Italy, and ceramic models of the more famous ones, such as the Cenotaph, were sold as souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|Later studies {{investigated}} {{aspects of}} the effect. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg sought to explore how automatic the preference process was.

The second group was asked to reason why they liked some numbers better than others and to analyse which features of the numbers they liked. As the researchers had predicted, they found that both the birthday-number effect and name-letter effect disappeared in the ‘thinking’ condition. They argued that thinking about reasons instigates deliberative overriding of implicit self-esteem effects. This conclusion was supported by looking at correlations between the effects: whereas in the feeling condition {{the strength of a}} participant's birthday-number effect was correlated to his or her name-letter effect, no such correlation was found in the thinking condition.|$|E

40|$|Background: We {{know that}} medical students' biographical {{characteristics}} {{and academic achievement}} influence career preference. Less {{is known about the}} differential association of these characteristics with <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> distinct specialties at different stages of medical training. Aim: To investigate the association between biographical characteristics and academic achievement with <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> specific medical specialties among first year medical students, before the clerkships, during clerkships {{and at the end of}} medical school. Methods: A written questionnaire was completed by medical students from two Dutch medical schools in 2002. Five medical specialties were selected for analysis (general practice, internal medicine, surgery, paediatrics and psychiatry). Biographical characteristics (gender, parental education and profession, and academic achievement were used to construct a prognostic model related to the <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> a medical career. Results: Being female and having a parent in general practice was positively associated with a <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> a career in general practice. Male gender was positively associated with a <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> a career in surgery. In first-year students, and in students with no clerkship experience, male gender was positively associated with a <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> a career in internal medicine. Among students with clerkship experience and final-year students the duration of study was positively associated with a <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> a career in internal medicine. For all students together, female gender was positively associated with a <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> a career in paediatrics. In first-year students, and in students with no clerkship experience, female gender was positively associated with a <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> a career in psychiatry. Conclusions: Our findings show that the medical background of the parents and gender are positively associated with a <b>preference</b> <b>for</b> a career, especially for general practice.
