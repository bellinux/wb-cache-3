50|$|The {{buildings}} on campus house the Community residence, the Secondary {{school and the}} Loreto Education office. The School buildings have been erected on a phased basis in response to educational needs and student population. In the 1980s, {{with the help of}} a <b>partial</b> <b>grant</b> from the Department of Education, the old prefabricated building was updated and became known as “St. Michael’s”. Following the Loreto Community contribution and fund-raising, the Sports Hall was added in the late 1980s. In 1999, the Trustees gave the Community Chapel to the Secondary School for development as a Staff room. In response to the increasing student population in the Secondary School the Trustees also agreed to give the Junior School and Kindergarten classrooms for use in the Secondary School. In 2000, a large extension was added to the lunchroom and recreation area. Two additional classrooms and a new fire stairs were also part of this development. A new fully equipped Computer Room with a LAN system was completed. The development of the reception/entrance area awaits development.|$|E

40|$|This work {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} high temperature days on large wildland fires during 1978 – 2010 in Arag ́ on (NE Spain). A high temperature day was established when air temperature was higher than 20 ◦ C at 850 hPa. Tempera- ture at 850 hPa was chosen because it properly characterizes the low troposphere state, {{and some of the}} problems that af- fect surface reanalysis do not occur. High temperature days were analyzed from April to October in the study period, and the number of these extreme days increased significantly. This temporal trend implied more frequent adverse weather conditions in later years that could facilitate extreme fire be- havior. The effects of those high temperatures days in large wildland fire patterns have been increasingly important in the last years of the series. We are thankful to the University of Lleida and Pau Costa Foundation for supporting this study through a <b>partial</b> <b>grant</b> to fund Cardil’s PhD studies. We also thank Joaquim García-Codina, Miguel Lazaro and Luis Besold for help in the classification of HTDs and other detailed checking in the official wildland fire data base, and finally to Marta Fajo-Pascual and Antonio Muñoz for help in the statistical analysis and the EGIF Databas...|$|E
40|$|Heat-wave {{events are}} {{commonly}} recognized as adverse impacts on agriculture, forests, and economic activities. Several {{studies showed that}} future climate changes in the western Mediterranean Basin will {{lead to an increase}} in extreme weather events, mainly in the summer season. For this reason, it is crucial to improve our knowledge on the effects of extreme temperature events on wildland fire activity. This work analyses the relation between high temperature days (air temperature higher than 25 °C at 850 hPa) and large wildland fires in Sardinia (Italy) during the period 1991 - 2009. Our results showed that the influence of high temperature days on large wildland fires was remarkable. Neither the number of fires nor the area burned decreased under high temperature days, although a decrease of both parameters was observed on other days. Additionally, the average size of fires, the probability of large fire occurrence, the daily area burned and daily number of fires were higher on high temperature days. We are thankful to the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (ForBurn Ref: AGL 2012 - 40098 -CO 3 - 01) for supporting this study.

40|$|In Spain, the {{established}} fire control policy states that all fires must be controlled {{and put out}} as soon as possible. Though budgets have not restricted operations until recently, we still experience large fires and we often face multiple-fire situations. Furthermore, fire conditions are expected to worsen in the future and budgets are expected to drop. To optimize the deployment of firefighting resources, we must gain insights into the factors affecting how it is conducted. We analyzed the national data base of historical fire records in Spain for patterns of deployment of fire suppression resources for large fires. We used artificial neural networks to model the relationships between the daily fire load, fire duration, fire type, fire size and response time, and the personnel and terrestrial and aerial units deployed for each fire in the period 1998 - 2008. Most of the models highlighted the positive correlation of burned area and fire duration with the number of resources assigned to each fire and some highlighted the negative influence of daily fire load. We found evidence suggesting that firefighting resources in Spain may already be under duress in their compliance with Spain’s current full suppression policy. The authors gratefully acknowledge the provision of historical fire occurrence data by the National Forest Fire Statistics database (EGIF), Ministry of Environment and Rural and Marine Affairs (MAGRAMA).
