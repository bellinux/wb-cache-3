We report a case of tibial neuropathy caused by a myxoid liposarcoma at the popliteal fossa, which was diagnosed by electrophysiologic studies, magnetic resonance imaging and an open excisional biopsy.

40|$|In {{order to}} test the {{regenerative}} capacity of atrophic axons, a constricting ligature was placed around the <b>proximal</b> <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve</b> of the rabbit, and the nerve crushed at the ankle one week later. Axonal atrophy with altered g ratios was subsequently confirmed in fibres distal {{to the site of}} ligature and proximal to the site of crush. In nerves with tight proximal ligatures the reinnervation of plantar muscles and the subsequent recovery of distal motor latency were delayed, indicating impaired regeneration. This result may be relevant to the "double-crush" theory of nerve damage...|$|E
40|$|Functional {{recovery}} is usually poor following {{peripheral nerve injury}} when reinnervation is delayed. Early innervation by sensory nerve has been indicated to prevent atrophy of the denervated muscle. It is hypothesized that early protection with sensory axons is adequate to improve functional recovery of skeletal muscle following prolonged denervation of mixed nerve injury. In this study, four groups of rats received surgical denervation of the <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve.</b> The <b>proximal</b> and distal stumps of the <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve</b> were ligated in all animals except {{for those in the}} immediate repair group. The experimental groups underwent denervation with nerve protection of peroneal nerve (mixed protection) or sural nerve (sensory protection). The experimental and unprotected groups had a stage II surgery in which the trimmed <b>proximal</b> and distal <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve</b> stumps were sutured together. After 3 months of recovery, electrophysiological, histological and morphometric parameters were assessed. It was detected that the significant muscle atrophy and a good preserved structure of the muscle were observed in the unprotected and protective experimental groups, respectively. Significantly fewer numbers of regenerated myelinated axons were observed in the sensory-protected group. Enhanced recovery in the mixed protection group was indicated by the results of the muscle contraction force tests, regenerated myelinated fiber, and the results of the histological analysis. Our results suggest that early axons protection by mixed nerve may complement sensory axons which are required for promoting functional recovery of the denervated muscle natively innervated by mixed nerve...|$|R

30|$|In {{this type}} of tibial hemimelia, {{there is only a}} <b>proximal</b> <b>tibial</b> {{epiphysis}} present and no <b>proximal</b> <b>tibial</b> physis. The <b>proximal</b> <b>tibial</b> epiphysis is often unossified at an early age. The foot is in severe equinovarus, and the fibula is relatively overgrown and proximally migrated at the knee. The treatment preferred is also a two-stage surgery similar to that described for Paley type 4 a tibial hemimelia. Since the tibial epiphysis is so small it needs to be fixed to the proximal femoral ring with an axial wire and/or a transverse tibial epiphysis wire to prevent the tibial epiphysis from being transported distally during the distal transport of the proximal fibula. There are two options for the fibular transport. The first option is to bring it down to station and then osteotomize as described for type 4 a. The second option is to distract the fibular head below the level of the <b>proximal</b> <b>tibial</b> epiphysis. In this case the <b>proximal</b> <b>tibial</b> epiphysis is fused to the proximal fibular epiphysis (Fig.  10 left leg). This has the advantage of preserving and transferring the proximal fibular physis to become the <b>proximal</b> <b>tibial</b> physis, thus reducing leg length discrepancy from the absence of a <b>proximal</b> <b>tibial</b> physis.|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundFracture of the <b>proximal</b> <b>tibial</b> {{metaphysis}} {{in children}} is a rare injury but notorious for carrying the risk of subsequent valgus deformity of the tibia. HypothesisTrampoline-caused fracture of the <b>proximal</b> <b>tibial</b> metaphysis in children may not progress into valgus. Materials and methodsWe followed up six children who collectively sustained seven fractures of the <b>proximal</b> <b>tibial</b> metaphysis while trampolining with other heavier and/or older children. Initial and follow-up x-rays were reviewed by an orthopaedic surgeons and two radiologists. ResultsNone of the patients developed valgus deformity with follow-up. ConclusionTrampoline {{is associated with a}} specific type of injury to the proximal tibia when children are trampolining with other heavier children even without falling off the trampoline. This fracture is linear and complete, often non-displaced. Unlike “other” <b>proximal</b> <b>tibial</b> metaphyseal fractures, trampoline-associated <b>proximal</b> <b>tibial</b> metaphysical fracture in children is not associated with a risk of subsequent valgus deformity.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{traumatic}} 5 ’#{ 176 }, vascular, and rheumatic 7 lesions {{in the area of the}} knee tend to affect the peroneal nerve more than the <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve.</b> Although sparing of the <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve</b> after severe trauma to the knee has been reported 3, some dysfunction of the <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve</b> as a sequel to a traumatici, vascular’, or rheumatic 6 lesion of the knee is not uncommon.

50|$|The exact {{cause of}} Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome (TTS) {{can vary from}} patient to patient. However the same end result is true for all patients, the {{compression}} of the posterior <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve</b> and it branches as it travels around the medial malleolus causes pain and irritation for the patient. There are many possible causes for compression of the <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve</b> therefore {{there are a variety}} of prevention strategies. One being immobilization, by placing the foot in a neutral position with a brace, pressure is relieved from the <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve</b> thus reducing patients pain. Eversion, inversion, and plantarflexion (as seen in figure 1) all can cause compression of the <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve</b> therefore in the neutral position the <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve</b> is less agitated. Typically this is recommended for the patient to do while sleeping(see figure 2). Another common problem is improper footwear, having shoes deforming the foot due to being too tight can lead to increased pressure on the <b>tibial</b> <b>nerve.</b> Having footwear that tightens the foot for extended periods of time even will lead to TTS. Therefore, by simply having properly fitted shoes TTS can be prevented.|$|R

Method: The study included 22 individuals who were operated at the National Traumatology and Orthopedics Institute (INTO) for correction of varus angular tibial deviation using the opening wedge osteotomy (OWO) technique with the Orthofix monolateral external fixator. Patients with OWO whose treatment was completed between January 2000 and December 2006 were analyzed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fractures of the <b>proximal</b> <b>tibial</b> {{epiphysis}} are rare. A {{series of}} twenty-eight fractures classified {{according to the}} Salter-Harris method showed that nine were Type II and eight, Type IV. Lawn-mower injuries, a previously unreported mode of injury for this fracture, caused five of the eight Type-IV fractures and {{were associated with the}} worst prognosis by far. Two Type-V fractures in the proxi-mal tibial epiphysis, previously unreported, are de-scribed. Despite the frequent exposure of the knee in children to violent trauma, the incidence of fracture of the <b>proximal</b> <b>tibial</b> epiphysis is extremely low, accounting for about 0. 5 per cent of all epiphyseal injuries’. The reason that this fracture is so rare is that the <b>proximal</b> <b>tibial</b> epiphysis ordi-narily receives no attachments from the medial or lateral collateral ligaments, and therefore the frequent varus and valgus stresses to the knee are transmitted not to the epiphysis but rather to the metaphysis distal to it. The an-tenor portion of the <b>proximal</b> <b>tibial</b> epiphysis includes the tongue-shaped epiphysis of the tibial tubercle, into which the patellar tendon inserts, and the forces transmitted through that tendon are an important cause of some of these fractures. Although the cruciate ligaments also insert into the <b>proximal</b> <b>tibial</b> epiphysis, they {{do not seem to be}} important in causing separations through the physis. An-other important force causing this fracture is direct trauma to the epiphysis. In none of the previous reports on fractures of the <b>proximal</b> <b>tibial</b> epiphysis have the fractures been described according to the method of Salter and Harris, presently the most commonly accepted classification of epiphyseal in-juries. In the present report, a ten-year experience of twenty-eight cases treated at the Mayo Clinic is described...|$|R
