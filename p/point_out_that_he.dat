25|$|The New Model Army then marched {{south to}} secure the ports of Wexford, Waterford and Duncannon. Wexford {{was the scene of}} another infamous atrocity, when Parliamentarian troops broke into the town while {{negotiations}} for its surrender were ongoing, and sacked it, killing about 2,000 soldiers and 1,500 townspeople and burning much of the town. Cromwell's responsibility for the sack of Wexford is disputed. He did not order the attack on the town, and had been in the process of negotiating its surrender when his troops broke into the town. On the other hand, his critics <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> made little effort to restrain his troops or to punish them afterwards for their conduct.|$|E

25|$|Rome's own gladiatorial {{contests}} began some 40 years later. The Samnite, {{borrowed from}} the Campanians, was the earliest of the gladiator types and the model upon which later classes were based. The Samnite gladiators were also the first {{of at least three}} gladiator classes (list of Roman gladiator types) to be based on ethnic antecedents; other examples were the Gauls and the Thracians. These gladiators fought with the signature war equipment and in the martial style of ethnic groups who had been conquered by Rome, thus appropriating their source culture for the mocking milieu of the Roman games. Gladiators who fought as any particular type did not necessarily hail from that ethnic background; the tombstone of a gladiator named Thelyphus is careful to <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> fought as a Samnite but was really a Thracian.|$|E
25|$|Some {{historians have}} alleged that Tayloe {{may have been}} a spy for the Confederate States of America during the Civil War. William Tidwell and others <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a noted Southern sympathizer, and that he had the education, skill, connections, and opportunity. Tidwell has even alleged that Tayloe met with John B. Magruder and George Washington Custis Lee (son of Robert E. Lee), both men later to be generals in the Confederate States Army, on April 21, 1861—the day before Robert E. Lee left Washington, D.C., to join the rebel armies. This left Tayloe in charge of a secret espionage ring in the city, it is claimed. Tayloe may also have helped provide funds to Confederate prisoners housed at the Old Capitol Prison in the city. It is even claimed that Tayloe may have helped {{conceive}} the kidnapping plot which later became a plan to kill President Lincoln.|$|E
25|$|Moses's {{critics charge}} that he {{preferred}} automobiles over people. They <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> displaced {{hundreds of thousands of}} residents in New York City, destroying traditional neighborhoods by building multiple expressways through them. These projects contributed to the ruin of the South Bronx and the amusement parks of Coney Island, caused the departure of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants Major League baseball teams, and precipitated the decline of public transport due to disinvestment and neglect. His building of expressways hindered the proposed expansion of the New York City Subway from the 1930s well into the 1960s, because the parkways and expressways that were built replaced, at least to some extent, the planned subway lines; the 1968 Program for Action, which was never completed, was hoped to counter this. Other {{critics charge that}} he precluded the use of public transit, which would have allowed non-car-owners to enjoy the elaborate recreation facilities he built, and close associates of Moses claimed that they could keep African Americans from using pools in white neighborhoods by making the water too cold.|$|E

In his {{introductory}} monologue, {{he tried}} to <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a nice guy despite his sometimes macabre roles. Video clips were then played of Sarsgaard scaring the SNL cast. One sketch featured the Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) global scare, which was still fresh in many minds, {{and one of the}} skits included a promotion for the Peter Sarsgaard [...] "SARS-Guard", a reference to the mania of facemasks worn in public by those fearing infection.|$|E
500|$|Gay doubled {{his gold}} medal {{count in the}} 200m event. He ran a new {{championship}} record time of 19.76s to win a second gold medal, beating Usain Bolt and Spearmon to the post. Bolt was clear to <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> lost to the better athlete: [...] "I got beaten by the No. 1 man in the world. For the moment, he is unbeatable." [...] Only Maurice Greene and Gatlin had won the sprint double at the Championships before, but Gay eyed a third gold in the 4 x 100 meters relay. The Americans faced stiff competition from the Jamaican team, which included Powell and Bolt. The Jamaicans set a national record, {{but it was not}} enough to beat the United States team, who finished in a world-leading time of 37.78s. Gay won his third gold medal alongside Darvis Patton, Spearmon and Leroy Dixon. The triple-gold haul repeated the feat achieved by Maurice Greene at the 1999 Seville World Championships and Carl Lewis in 1983 and 1987.|$|E
500|$|Metternich {{has been}} both praised and heavily criticised for the {{policies}} he pursued. His supporters <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> presided over the [...] "Age of Metternich", when international diplomacy helped prevent major wars in Europe. His qualities as a diplomat are commended, some noting that his achievements were considerable {{in light of the}} weakness of his negotiating position. His decision to oppose Russian imperialism is seen as a good one. His detractors describe him as a boor who stuck to ill-thought-out, conservative principles out of vanity and a sense of infallibility. They argue he could have done much to secure Austria's future; instead, his 1817 proposals for administrative reform were largely rejected, and his opposition to German nationalism is blamed for Germany's unification under Prussia and not Austria. Other historians have argued that he had far less power than this view suggests and that his policies were only exercised when they were in accord with the views of Austria's Habsburg monarchy.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike {{any other}} [...] "alternative Shakespeare", Marlowe was a {{brilliant}} poet and dramatist already and was the main creator of so-called [...] "Shakespearian" [...] blank verse drama.

2500|$|Those {{who view}} him {{as little more}} than an opportunist often <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> only joined the above {{organizations}} after the South was defeated, and the political winds shifted. During the War, however, he had worked in support of the Confederacy, leading modern historians like Phillips to take a more cynical view of his later support of the Freedmen and the Union League. [...] A significant number of former Confederates opted to join the Republican Party after the war, and some, such as James Longstreet and James L. Alcorn became [...] "scalawags" [...] at least partly in the interest of national reconciliation.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{objections}} from Semmelweis's critics stemmed from his claim, that every case of childbed fever {{was caused by}} resorption of cadaveric particles. [...] Some of Semmelweis's first critics even responded that he had said nothing new - it had long been known that cadaveric contamination could cause childbed fever. [...] But this {{was only one of}} many possible causes for childbed fever. [...] The findings from autopsies of deceased women also showed a confusing multitude of various symptoms, which emphasised the belief that puerperal fever was not one disease, but rather many different diseases, which remained unidentified. Semmelweis's critics were also quick to <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had virtually no evidence for his self-infection theory.|$|E

2500|$|A {{pilot for}} a live-action TV series was {{produced}} in 1995. It was produced by Touchstone Television. The pilot only referenced the character names and starred none of the cast from the original film, contained no foul language, and did not feature Silent Bob. The character of Jay was featured, prompting Smith to <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> owned the character rights to both Jay and Silent Bob (for the purposes of featuring them in separate films). The producers' solution was to change the character's name to Ray. Kevin Smith {{was unaware of the}} production of the series until casting was underway.

2500|$|King {{was highly}} {{intelligent}} and extremely capable, but controversial. Some consider {{him to have}} been one of the greatest admirals of the 20th century; others, however, <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never commanded ships or fleets at sea in war time, and that his Anglophobia led him to make decisions which cost many Allied lives. Others see as indicative of strong leadership his willingness and ability to counter both British and U.S. Army influence on American World War II strategy, and praise his sometimes outspoken recognition of the strategic importance of the Pacific War. His instrumental role in the decisive Guadalcanal Campaign has earned him admirers in the United States and Australia, and some also consider him an organizational genius.
