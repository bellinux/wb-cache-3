Intrinsically the ideal reflexion {{is a point}} in s-space, but fiber symmetry turns it into a ring smeared out by rotation about the fiber direction. Two rings represent each reflexion on the Polanyi sphere, because scattering is <b>point</b> <b>symmetric</b> {{with respect to the}} origin of s-space. Mapped onto the detector are only those points of the reflexion in s-space that are both on the Ewald sphere and on the Polanyi sphere. These points form the reflexion circle (blue ring). It does not change as the fiber is tilted. As with a slide projector the reflexion circle is projected (red moving rays) on the detector (detector circle, blue ring). There up to 4 images (red spots) of the monitored reflexion can show up. The position of the reflexion images {{is a function of the}} orientation of the fiber in the primary beam (Polanyi equation). Inverted, from the positions of the reflexion images the orientation of the fiber can be determined, if for the Miller index [...] both [...] and [...] is valid. From the Polanyi representation of fiber diffraction geometry the relations of the fiber mapping are established by elementary and spherical geometry.|$|E

We suppose that a normal pressure P[(x, y) and a tangential pressure p 2 (x, v) are applied at every point of the boundary of B, where p{, p 2 lie in {{the plane of the}} cross-section and are independent of the vertical co-ordinate. It was shown by Cassisa (1982) that in this situation, given an arbitrary normal pressure pu the tangential pressure p 2 can be so chosen, that a purely plane stress tensor a exists with the above hypotheses, provided that a certain 3 x 3 matrix M, depending only on the curve £, is non-singular.
