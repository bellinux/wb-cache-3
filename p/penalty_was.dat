During Clinton's term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty had been re-enacted on March 23, 1973). As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by electric chair and three by lethal injection. Later, as president, Clinton was the first president to pardon a death-row inmate since the federal death <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> reinstated in 1988.|$|E

Some <b>penalties</b> <b>are</b> fixed dollar amounts or fixed percentages of some measure required to be reported. Excise taxes used as <b>penalties</b> <b>are</b> imposed in the Code sections relating to particular kinds of transactions.

5|$|As a Premier League team, Chelsea {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the Third Round, where they were drawn at home to Portsmouth. After a goalless first half Juan Mata struck early in the second, before Ramires hit two in two minutes and Frank Lampard scored in stoppage time to give Chelsea a 4–0 win. Chelsea then travelled to face local rivals Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road in the Fourth Round, where a controversial Mata <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> enough to see them through.|$|E
5|$|By Justinian's time, {{the scheme}} was simpler: instead of {{complementing}} actions for manifest and non-manifest theft, handling stolen goods, or concealing them made one instead liable for non-manifest theft, whose two-times <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> maintained. Searches {{were carried out}} by public authorities, and the wide definition of theft covered a bad faith receiver of goods.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{struck the}} ball low {{and hard to}} his right; despite Neville Southall getting his fingers to it, the <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> {{successful}} and brought the scores level.

Two minutes later he made his second and final substitution, bringing off Mickey Thomas for Clayton Blackmore.|$|E

5|$|Taylor gave up {{appealing}} {{his sentence}} after his request for retrial {{was rejected by}} the Utah Supreme Court. He became the second person to be executed by firing squad in the United States (after Gary Gilmore) since the death <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> reinstated in 1976. Taylor said he chose this method of execution to embarrass the state of Utah. On January 26, 1996, the day of Taylor's execution, legislation was introduced in the Utah House of Representatives to eliminate the firing squad.|$|E
5|$|Teuruarii IV, born Epatiana a Teuruarii (c. 1879 – 1933), was {{the last}} King of Rurutu, an island within the larger Austral Islands archipelago, who ruled from around 1886 until the {{annexation}} of the island to France in 1900. Proclaimed king upon his father's abdication while still a child, his mother ruled as regent.

Soon afterwards, Liverpool scored again as Šmicer beat Dida with a long-range {{shot into the}} bottom left-hand corner to leave Liverpool a goal behind. Three minutes after Šmicer's goal, Liverpool were awarded a penalty, after Gerrard made a run into the Milan box for Baros' lay-off and was brought down by Gennaro Gattuso. Xabi Alonso's <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> saved, but he scored from the rebound to equalise for Liverpool. Milan and Liverpool had chances {{to take the lead}} after this, but Clarence Seedorf and Riise failed to score.|$|E

Brad Park then scored his only goal of the series at even strength to complete some pretty passing between Dennis Hull and the Rangers' teammates of Ratelle, Gilbert and Park to tie the score. The period ended with the teams tied 2–2.|$|E
5|$|Aquino was {{succeeded by}} Fidel V. Ramos, {{who won the}} Philippine presidential {{election}} held in May 1992. During this period the country's economic performance remained modest, with a 5–7 percent GDP growth rate. However, the political stability and economic improvements, such as the peace agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front in 1996, were overshadowed by {{the onset of the}} 1997 Asian financial crisis. On his Presidency the death <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> revived {{in the light of the}} Rape-slay case of Eileen Sarmienta and Allan Gomez in 1993 and the first person to be executed was Leo Echegaray in 1999.|$|E

5|$|As drive-through {{penalties}} are not admissible for appeal, McLaren's lawyer Mark Phillips QC {{attempted to}} convince the court that since the <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> {{in the form of}} time added on, the case was valid. They presented the previous case of Vitantonio Liuzzi at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix, specifically the FIA's claim that the presiding chief steward at the race, Tony Scott Andrews, had admitted fault in awarding the penalty to Liuzzi. Andrews denied the FIA's allegation. McLaren went on to use the case as a precedent for the Spa incident. The Court stated that this analogy was invalid, since in Liuzzi's case the admissibility of his appeal was not contested.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> taken, the Welsh dugout was {{surrounded}} by press and photographers, as the home team were still leading 1–0. With the scores levelled, the pack switched {{their attention to the}} Scottish bench, which led to Stein remonstrating with at least one photographer {{to move out of the}} way of his view of the game. Both Professor Stewart Hillis, the Scotland team doctor (who was also Stein's consultant), and Welsh manager Mike England stated that there appeared to be nothing wrong at this point.|$|E
5|$|Before Euro 2000, Nedvěd {{was unable}} to train {{normally}} due to an ankle injury. The Czechs' first match (against the Netherlands) saw him and international teammate Jan Koller hit the woodwork without scoring, before the Dutch scored a controversial penalty to win 1–0. In the second match, against France, he was fouled, where the resultant Czech <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> converted by Karel Poborský to even the score at 1–1. Despite two shots on goal, Nedvěd could not beat French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez and France won the match 2–1. He played in the third group match, against Denmark; despite the Czechs' 2–0 victory, the team was eliminated from the tournament. After Euro 2000, Nedvěd took over the national team captaincy from Jiří Němec.|$|E

5|$|During Gladbach's opening {{match of}} the 2013–14 season against Bayern Munich, Domínguez conceded a penalty when he handled {{the ball in}} the box. Thomas Müller's {{resultant}} <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> saved by goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen but Domínguez handled again from the rebound, giving away a second penalty which was duly converted by David Alaba. Gladbach ultimately lost the match 3–1. It was an injury-disrupted season for Domínguez, though, as early in October he suffered a broken collarbone and dislocated shoulder. He managed just 22 appearances for the campaign, and 34 in the next before a spate of back injuries severely curtailed his playing time in the seasons that followed.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Graham Mourie captained New Zealand {{to their}} first Grand Slam, {{including}} a 13–12 victory over Wales. That game generated controversy after New Zealand won {{as the result of}} a late penalty. Lock Andy Haden had dived out of a line-out in an attempt to earn a penalty, but referee Roger Quittenden insisted the <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> against Welsh lock Geoff Wheel for jumping off the shoulder of Frank Oliver. New Zealand's only loss on the tour was the famous 12–0 defeat by Irish province Munster at Thomond Park. Later a play which focused on the loss was written by John Breen, called Alone it Stands.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, other historians like Masahiro Yamamoto {{have argued}} that the death {{sentence}} was too severe a penalty for Matsui's crime of mere negligence in failing to stop the massacre. The journalist Richard Minear also points out that Matsui's <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> disproportionately severe compared to the other convicted defendants. Kuniaki Koiso was found guilty on four counts and Mamoru Shigemitsu was found guilty on five counts, in both cases including one count of negligence, and both were given prison sentences. Matsui, by contrast, was found guilty of only one count of negligence but was sentenced to death. The historian Tokushi Kasahara argues that the prosecution at the IMTFE did not attempt seriously to investigate all those {{who were involved in the}} Nanking Massacre, and instead just decided to make Matsui the sole scapegoat for the whole atrocity.|$|E
