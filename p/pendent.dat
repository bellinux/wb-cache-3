5|$|Banksia aculeata, {{commonly}} known as prickly banksia, is a species of plant of the family Proteaceae native to the Stirling Range in the southwest of Western Australia. A shrub up to 2m (7ft) tall, it has dense foliage and leaves with very prickly serrated margins. Its unusual pinkish, <b>pendent</b> (hanging) flower spikes, known as inflorescences, are generally hidden in the foliage and appear during the early summer. Although it was collected by the naturalist James Drummond in the 1840s, Banksia aculeata was not formally described until 1981—by Alex George in his monograph of the genus.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} by Swiss botanist Carl Meissner in 1856, {{it was named}} in honour of English botanist Charles Morgan Lemann. It {{is one of three}} or four related species all with <b>pendent</b> inflorescences, which is an unusual feature within the genus. No subspecies are recognised. Banksia lemanniana is classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia. Unlike many Western Australian banksias, it appears to have some resistance to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, {{and is one of the}} easier Western Australian species to grow in cultivation.|$|E

5|$|Banksia caleyi, {{commonly}} known as the red lantern banksia or Caley's banksia, is a species of woody shrub of the family Proteaceae native to Western Australia. It generally grows as a dense shrub up to 2m (7ft) tall, has serrated leaves and unusual red, <b>pendent</b> (hanging) inflorescences which are generally hidden in the foliage. First described by Scottish naturalist Robert Brown in 1830, Banksia caleyi was named in honour of the English botanist George Caley. No subspecies are recognised. It is one of three or four related species with hanging inflorescences, which is an unusual feature within the genus.|$|E
5|$|The {{plants are}} scapose, having a single central {{leafless}} hollow flower stem (scape). Several green or blue-green, narrow, strap-shaped leaves {{arise from the}} bulb. The plant stem usually bears a solitary flower, but occasionally a cluster of flowers (umbel). The flowers, which are usually conspicuous and white or yellow, sometimes both or rarely green, consist of a perianth of three parts. Closest to the stem (proximal) is a floral tube above the ovary, then an outer ring composed of six tepals (undifferentiated sepals and petals), and a central disc to conical shaped corona. The flowers may hang down (<b>pendent),</b> or be erect. There are six pollen bearing stamens surrounding a central style. The ovary is inferior (below the floral parts) consisting of three chambers (trilocular). The fruit consists of a dry capsule that splits (dehisces) releasing numerous black seeds.|$|E

25|$|It {{is worthy}} {{to note that}} due to the {{multiple}} reactive sites of the multivinyl monomers, plenty of unreacted <b>pendent</b> vinyl groups are introduced to linear primary polymer chains. These <b>pendent</b> vinyl groups {{have the potential to}} react with propagating active centres either from their own polymer chain or others. Therefore, both of the intramolecular cyclization and intermolecular crosslinking might occur in this process.|$|E

50|$|Since pendant {{lights are}} {{typically}} smaller {{and placed in}} sets, {{it is important to}} follow general lighting rules to avoid creating poor lighting. An odd number of pendants is preferable to an even amount. Typically, 60-75 watt equivalent lights are needed for every 20 inches of counter space. Regarding height, pendants should be placed high enough to allow an unobstructed view while either sitting or standing. <b>Pendents</b> should be placed 28-38 inches above a counter top, or 72 inches above the floor.|$|R
25|$|In {{a similar}} way to normal ATRP, the {{polymerization}} is started by initiation to produce a free radical, followed by chain propagation and reversible activation/deactivation equilibrium. Unlike the polymerization of single vinyl monomers, for the polymerization of multivinyl monomers, the chain propagation occurs between the active centres {{and one of the}} vinyl groups from the free monomers. Therefore, multiple unreacted <b>pendent</b> vinyl groups are introduced into the linear primary polymer chains, resulting in a high local/spatial vinyl concentration. As the chain grows, the propagating centre reacts with their own <b>pendent</b> vinyl groups to form intramolecular cyclized rings (i.e. intramolecular cyclization). The unique alternating chain propagation/intramolecular cyclization process eventually leads to the single chain cyclized/knotted polymer architecture.|$|E

25|$|Seals {{are used}} {{primarily}} to authenticate documents, specifically those which carry some legal import. There {{are two main}} ways in which a seal may be attached to a document. It may be applied directly to {{the face of the}} paper or parchment (an applied seal); or it may hang loose from it (a <b>pendent</b> seal). A <b>pendent</b> seal may be attached to cords or ribbons (sometimes in the owner's livery colors), or to the two ends of a strip (or tag) of parchment, threaded through holes or slots cut in the lower edge of the document: the document is often folded double at this point (a plica) to provide extra strength. Alternatively, the seal may be attached to a narrow strip of the material of the document (again, in this case, usually parchment), sliced and folded down, as a tail or tongue, but not detached. The object in all cases is to help ensure authenticity by maintaining the integrity of the relationship between document and seal, and to prevent the seal's reuse. If a forger tries to remove an applied seal from its document, it will almost certainly break. A <b>pendent</b> seal is easily detached by cutting the cords or strips of parchment, but the forger would then have great difficulty in attaching it to another document (not least because the cords or parchment are normally knotted inside the seal), and would again almost certainly break it.|$|E

50|$|Different {{categories}} of sails are reefed (reduced in size) in different manners and therefore have different fixtures that achieve shortening of sail. Traditional canvas square and gaff-rigged sails have one ore more rows of reefing lines that {{pass through the}} sail, which reach around the sail that has been gathered in to reduce its size and secure the remaining unreefed sail to the spar (square rig) or boom (gaff rig).

25|$|The mummy {{found in}} the tomb was however at first {{identified}} as belonging to a woman by two visiting physicians who examined the remains in situ. This led Davis to conclude {{he had found the}} mummy of queen Tiye and he therefore published his account of the discovery as The Tomb of Queen Tiyi. As possible reasons for this initial identification the (typical female) position of the mummy's arms, (Kegan Paul, 1990) p.44-49 post-mortem damage to the pelvic bones (Thames and Hudson, 1988) p. 199 and the absence of male genitalia have been suggested. But when anatomist Grafton Elliot Smith examined the skull and bones in Cairo a few months later he concluded that they were those of a young male, with wide hips, a <b>pendent</b> chin and distorted cranium brought on by chronic hydrocephalus. The age of death he estimated as being around 25 years although he later suggested the possibility that the body had suffered from Frölich's syndrome which delayed normal skeletal maturation. These results were seen to support the initial claims by Weigall, Maspero and Smith, based on other evidence {{found in the}} tomb (see above) that the body was that of Akhenaten.|$|E
25|$|Using the {{deactivation}} enhanced strategy, {{a relatively}} small instantaneous kinetic chain length limits the number of vinyl groups that {{can be added to}} a propagating chain end during each activation/deactivation cycles and thus keeps the polymer chains growing in a limited space. In this way, unlike what happens in free radical polymerization (FRP), the formation of huge polymer chains and large-scale combinations at early reaction stages is avoided. Therefore, a small instantaneous kinetic chain length is the prerequisite for further manipulation of intramolecular cyclization or intermolecular crosslinking. Based on the small instantaneous kinetic chain length, regulation of different chain dimensions and concentrations would lead to distinct reaction types. A low ratio of initiator to monomer would result in the formation of longer chains but of a lower chain concentration, This scenario would no doubt increases the chances of intramolecular cyclization due to the high local/spatial vinyl concentration within the growth boundary. Although the opportunity for intermolecular reactions can increase as the polymer chains grow, the likelihood of this occurring at the early stage of reactions is minimal due to the low chain concentration, which is why single chain cyclized/knotted polymers can form. However, in contrast, a high initiator concentration not only diminishes the chain dimension during the linear-growth phase thus suppressing the intramolecular cyclization, but it also increases the chain concentration within the system so that <b>pendent</b> vinyl groups in one chain are more likely to fall into the growth boundary of another chain. Once the monomers are converted to short chains, the intermolecular combination increases and allows the formation of hyperbranched structures with a high density of branching and vinyl functional groups.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, {{a host of}} dispersants {{derived by}} poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) (SMA) were prepared. Part 1 By varying the {{structure}} parameters of the SMA copolymer and the functions of side chain, the designed dispersants are effective to disperse several kinds of the inorganic particles. Carboxylic sodium salts (-COONa) on the SMA backbone with the ratio of styrene/MA= 6 / 1 (SMA 6000) which could disperse MgSO 4 in toluene phase at 12 wt % and stable for 2 month. SMA 2000 grafted on the M 2070 as the <b>pendents</b> could decrease the yellow pigments' particle size (α-FeOOH) from the range of 550 - 1750 nm to 210 nm and it also effective as the coloring agents (improve the color ability). SMA 1000 -MPEG is good for wetting the cement particle, which could reduce the water quantity (from 30 g/ 100 g to 24 g/ 100 g water/cements) for cement mixture. Part 2 A family of comb-like polyamines was synthesized by grafting various polyoxypropylene-amines (POP-amines) on the styrene/maleic anhydride copolymers (SMA) through the amidoacid linkages. The polyamines {{were found to have}} a superior surfactancy of lowering the toluene/H 2 O interfacial tension until 4 mN/m at extremely low critical micelle concentration (CEC) of 10 - 3 w%. By varying the length of amine <b>pendents</b> and the styrene/maleic anhydride backbone ratio, the POP-grafting copolymers enable to intercalate sodium montmorillonite (Na+-MMT) in two different manners. With the ionic exchanging intercalation, the flexible pendants may anchor into silicate interlayer by the multiple quaternary ammonium salt (-NH 3 +Cl−) tethering groups. The driving force of ionic exchanging rendered the embedding of organic components and also the expansion of silicate gallery from 13 Å to 44 Å. As a result, the hydrophobic backbone of SMA copolymers could generate a corona phase or partially embedding in the gallery. Two types of core-shell structure with the layered silicates as a rigid core reflect their difference in the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance and hence the interfacial property. Their characterizations in thermal stability, dispersion in toluene and ability of decreasing surface tension are correlated to the core-shell structures. 在本研究，克服SMA多官能基易膠聯之性質，合成雙性梳狀型高分子，具有特殊之界面現象，並進一步利用梳狀型高分子末端之四級胺鹽，針對層狀黏土進行有機改質，有別於文獻中多數直鏈型插層劑之插層模式。利用多變之SMA主鏈，變換不同主、支鏈之長度與性質，討論多官能基之梳狀型插層劑以不同形式改變層狀材料之層間距。ABSTRACT	 3 Part 1 : The applications of poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) derived polymeric dispersants	 4 1.
