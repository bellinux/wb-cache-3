40|$|This thesis {{details the}} {{synthesis}} {{of a range of}} fluorous-tagged <b>phosphonium</b> <b>salts</b> in order to investigate their applications as phase transfer catalysts (PTC). Fluorous-tagged <b>phosphonium</b> <b>salts</b> have been prepared by the quatemisation of the fluorous tertiary phosphines, P(CH 2 CH 2 C 6 Fi 3) 3, P-CeHiCeFn and P-CerCrCfkCgFn, with benzyl bromide (BnBr), butyl bromide (BuBr), lH,lH, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorooctyl triflate (C 6 F 13 CH 2 CH 20 S 02 CF 3) and butyl triflate (n-C 4 H 9 OSOCF 3) in clean and high yielding reactions. All of the fluorous <b>phosphonium</b> <b>salts</b> were evaluated in potassium picrate extraction experiments in order to define their abilities to transfer picrate from an aqueous phase into an organic phase (benzotrifluoride). All of the salts showed good extraction of the picrate anion into the organic phase (68 - 100 %) demonstrating their potential for phase transfer catalysis. The fluorous-tagged <b>phosphonium</b> <b>salts</b> were tested in a model halide exchange reaction under phase transfer conditions. Both liquid-liquid and solid-liquid systems were tested, but the <b>phosphonium</b> <b>salts</b> performed better under liquid-liquid conditions. Recovery of the fluorous-tagged salts for subsequent reactions was attempted using fluorous reverse phase silica gel (FRPSG). Limited success was achieved due to the decomposition of the aromatic <b>phosphonium</b> <b>salts</b> during the phase transfer catalysed reaction. The stability of the 1 st generation of aromatic <b>phosphonium</b> <b>salts</b> was therefore examined under liquid-liquid (BTF/water) and solid-liquid (KI/BTF) phase transfer conditions. It was determined that the decomposition gave mainly the phosphine oxide and the stability of the <b>phosphonium</b> <b>salts,</b> that contained fluorous ponytails directly attached to the aromatic ring, was restricted under these conditions. A series of 2 nd generation salts containing the P-CeFUCFbCICgFn unit were synthesised and showed good preliminary stability results under liquid-liquid phase transfer conditions...|$|R

2500|$|Two years later, Smith and his {{co-workers}} publish a third-generation synthesis in which the bulky TBS ether protecting group at C(11) of the precursor iodide {{was replaced by a}} less sterically encumbering group, MOM. [...] This modification favors the formation of the desired <b>phosphonium</b> <b>salt.</b> The Smith third-generation synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 6.0% with a longest linear sequence of 21 steps and 35 total steps.|$|E
2500|$|The {{key feature}} of the {{fourth-generation}} approach was the utilization of bidirectional fragment, vinyl iodide/phosphonium salt. <b>phosphonium</b> <b>salt</b> could be readily obtained as the trisubstituted vinyl iodide is less reactive than alkyl iodide. A Wittig reaction with followed by Suzuki coupling with alkyl iodide efficiently furnished the backbone of (+)-discodermolide.

2500|$|Ferrocene, a {{precursor}} to iron nanoparticles, {{can be used as}} a catalyst for the production of carbon nanotubes. The vinylferrocene from ferrocene can be made by a Wittig reaction of the aldehyde, a <b>phosphonium</b> <b>salt</b> and sodium hydroxide. The vinyl ferrocene can be converted into a polymer (polyvinylferrocene, PVFc), a ferrocenyl version of polystyrene (the phenyl groups are replaced with ferrocenyl groups). Another polyferrocene which can be formed is poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl ferrocenecarboxylate), PFcMA. [...] In addition to using organic polymer backbones, these pendant ferrocene units have been attached to inorganic backbones such as polysiloxanes, polyphosphazenes, and polyphosphinoboranes, (PH(R)BH2)n, and the resulting materials exhibit unusual physical and electronic properties relating to the ferrocene / ferrocinium redox couple. [...] Both PVFc and PFcMA have been tethered onto silica wafers and the wettability measured when the polymer chains are uncharged and when the ferrocene moieties are oxidised to produce positively charged groups. [...] The contact angle with water on the PFcMA-coated wafers was 70° smaller following oxidation, while in the case of PVFc the decrease was 30°, and the switching of wettability is reversible. [...] In the PFcMA case, the effect of lengthening the chains and hence introducing more ferrocene groups is significantly larger reductions in the contact angle upon oxidation.|$|E

40|$|Various <b>phosphonium</b> <b>salts</b> {{possessing}} {{single or}} double alkyl chains of various lengths (C 1 O to C 18) were prepared as cationic biocides, and their antimicrobial activities against 11 typical strains of microorganisms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were evaluated. The <b>phosphonium</b> <b>salts</b> with long alkyl chains {{were found to}} show high levels of antimicrobial activity. Their activities depended strongly on the molecular structure, and a correlation between antimicrobial activity and molecular structure was observed. In the alkyltrimethylphosphonium salts, the bactericidal activity against S. aureus and Escherichia coli increased with increasing alkyl chain length, and the compound with the longest alkyl chain (C 18) killed all the bacterial cells (ca. 107 cells per ml) within 30 min of contact at concentrations of 2. 8 and 28,uM, respectively. In contrast, the bactericidal activity of dialkyldimethylphosphonium salts was found to decrease as the chain length of the substituents increased. It is significant that the phosphonium biocide containing double decyl groups exhibited the broadest spectrum of activity against microorganisms tested and showed the greatest bacteriostatic activity against MRSA (MIC = 0. 78,ug/ml). Furthermore, we systematically investigated differences in bactericidal activity between the <b>phosphonium</b> <b>salts</b> and commonly available ammonium salts with the same hydrophobic structure.
