40|$|Abstract – This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{measuring}} the thermal resistance of silicon <b>p-n</b> <b>diodes.</b> The values of this parameter given in the catalogues rarely correspond to the real conditions of device cooling, e. g. the diode operating on the heat-sink. Therefore, the value of the thermal resistance has to be obtained from measurements. In the paper a new comfortable method of the measurement of the thermal resistance of silicon <b>p-n</b> <b>diodes,</b> based on measurements of their d. c. current-voltage characteristic and the estimation of the model parameter values with the use of PARTS-software, is presented. The results of measurements obtained by the new method are compared to the standard pulse method. I...|$|R
2500|$|Normal (<b>p–n)</b> <b>diodes,</b> which {{operate as}} {{described}} above, are usually made of doped silicon or, more rarely, germanium. Before {{the development of}} silicon power rectifier diodes, cuprous oxide and later selenium was used. Their low efficiency required a much higher forward voltage to be applied (typically 1.4 to 1.7V per [...] "cell", with multiple cells stacked so as to increase the peak inverse voltage rating for application in high voltage rectifiers), and required a large heat sink (often {{an extension of the}} diode's metal substrate), much larger than the later silicon diode of the same current ratings would require. The vast majority of all <b>diodes</b> are the <b>p–n</b> <b>diodes</b> found in CMOS integrated circuits, which include two diodes per pin and many other internal diodes.|$|R
50|$|An {{electrical}} junction may {{be either a}} thermoelectricity junction, a metal-semiconductor junction or a p-n junction (p-type semiconductor-n-type semiconductor junction). Junctions are either rectifying or non-rectifying. Non-rectifying junctions are called ohmic contacts. Electronic components employing rectifying junctions include <b>p-n</b> <b>diodes,</b> Schottky diodes and bipolar junction transistors.|$|R

50|$|The wide {{intrinsic}} region {{is in contrast}} to an ordinary <b>p-n</b> <b>diode.</b> The wide {{intrinsic region}} makes the PIN diode an inferior rectifier (one typical function of a diode), but it makes it suitable for attenuators, fast switches, photodetectors, and high voltage power electronics applications.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{important}} {{difference between the}} <b>p-n</b> <b>diode</b> and the Schottky diode is the reverse recovery time (trr), when the diode switches from the conducting to the non-conducting state. In a <b>p-n</b> <b>diode,</b> the reverse recovery time {{can be in the}} order of several microseconds to less than 100 ns for fast diodes. Schottky diodes do not have a recovery time, as there is nothing to recover from (i.e., there is no charge carrier depletion region at the junction). The switching time is ~100 ps for the small-signal diodes, and up to tens of nanoseconds for special high-capacity power diodes. With p-n-junction switching, there is also a reverse recovery current, which in high-power semiconductors brings increased EMI noise. With Schottky diodes, switching is essentially [...] "instantaneous" [...] with only a slight capacitive loading, which is much less of a concern.|$|E
25|$|Schottky diodes are {{constructed}} from a metal to semiconductor contact. They {{have a lower}} forward voltage drop than <b>p–n</b> junction <b>diodes.</b> Their forward voltage drop at forward currents of about 1mA is in the range 0.15V to 0.45V, which makes them useful in voltage clamping applications and prevention of transistor saturation. They {{can also be used}} as low loss rectifiers, although their reverse leakage current is in general higher than that of other diodes. Schottky diodes are majority carrier devices and so do not suffer from minority carrier storage problems that slow down many other diodes—so they have a faster reverse recovery than <b>p–n</b> junction <b>diodes.</b> They also tend to have much lower junction capacitance than <b>p–n</b> <b>diodes,</b> which provides for high switching speeds and their use in high-speed circuitry and RF devices such as switched-mode power supply, mixers, and detectors.|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} study {{was performed to}} investigate the impact of crystallographic dislocation defects, 21 including screw dislocation, basal plane dislocation, and threading edge dislocation, and their locations in 22 active and JTE region, on the reverse performance of 4 H-SiC <b>p-n</b> <b>diodes.</b> It was found that higher leakage 23 current in diodes is associated with basal plane dislocations, while lower breakdown voltage is attributed to 24 screw dislocations. The above influence increases in severity when the dislocation is in the active region than 25 in the JTE region. Furthermore, due to the closed-core nature, the impact of threading edge dislocation on the 26 reverse performance of the <b>p-n</b> <b>diodes</b> is less severe than that of other dislocations although its density is 27 much higher.

50|$|A <b>p-n</b> <b>diode</b> {{is a type}} of {{semiconductor}} diode based upon the p-n junction. The diode conducts current in only one direction, and it is made by joining a p-type semiconducting layer to an n-type semiconducting layer. Semiconductor diodes have multiple uses including rectification of alternating current to direct current, detection of radio signals, emitting light and detecting light.|$|E
50|$|In electronics, the Zener effect (employed {{most notably}} in the {{appropriately}} named Zener diode) {{is a type of}} electrical breakdown. It occurs in a reverse biased <b>p-n</b> <b>diode</b> when the electric field enables tunneling of electrons from the valence to the conduction band of a semiconductor, leading to a large number of free minority carriers which suddenly increase the reverse current.|$|E
5000|$|This [...] "instantaneous" [...] {{switching}} is {{not always}} the case. In higher voltage Schottky devices, in particular, the guard ring structure needed to control breakdown field geometry creates a parasitic <b>p-n</b> <b>diode</b> with the usual recovery time attributes. As long as this guard ring diode is not forward biased, it adds only capacitance. If the Schottky junction is driven hard enough however, the forward voltage eventually will bias both diodes forward and actual trr will be greatly impacted.|$|E

50|$|Electrochemical etching (ECE) for dopant-selective {{removal of}} silicon {{is a common}} method to {{automate}} and to selectively control etching. An active <b>p-n</b> <b>diode</b> junction is required, and either type of dopant can be the etch-resistant ("etch-stop") material. Boron {{is the most common}} etch-stop dopant. In combination with wet anisotropic etching as described above, ECE has been used successfully for controlling silicon diaphragm thickness in commercial piezoresistive silicon pressure sensors. Selectively doped regions can be created either by implantation, diffusion, or epitaxial deposition of silicon.|$|E
50|$|The forward I-V {{characteristic}} is {{the same}} as that of an ordinary <b>P-N</b> <b>diode.</b> The breakdown starts when reverse voltage is applied. In the case of Zener breakdown, it starts at a particular voltage. In this diode the voltage remains relatively constant (independent of current) when it is connected in reverse bias. The backward diode is a special form of tunnel diode in which the tunneling phenomenon is only incipient, and the negative resistance region virtually disappears. The forward current is very small and becomes equivalent to the reverse current of a conventional diode.|$|E
5000|$|Here, the {{operation}} of the abrupt <b>p-n</b> <b>diode</b> is considered. By [...] "abrupt" [...] is meant that the p- and n-type doping exhibit a step function discontinuity at the plane where they encounter each other. The objective is to explain the various bias regimes in the figure displaying current-voltage characteristics. Operation is described using band-bending diagrams that show how the lowest conduction band energy and the highest valence band energy vary with position inside the diode under various bias conditions. For additional discussion, see the articles Semiconductor and Band diagram.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{present for the}} first time the results from the {{long-term}} testing of power <b>p-n</b> <b>diodes,</b> grown on 4 H-SiC substrates by liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). A comparison with 4 H-SiC <b>p-n</b> <b>diodes,</b> made on commercially available chemical vapor deposition (CVD) p+pnon+ epitaxial wafers within the same device processing, is given. The increase of the forward voltage drop, DVF, as a function of the time for LPE and CVD diodes was observed. The striking feature was that the forward degradation in LPE diodes is expressed in less extent than the CVD ones. The observed lower degradation of the LPE diodes is explained by the lower recombination centers density (< 1013 cm– 3) in LPE layers and consequently of the lower defects propagation when the diodes are subjected to a current load. At the same time, an increase of the specific on-state resistance is observed, which is explained by the presence of thin transition layer...|$|R
25|$|This term is {{used both}} for {{conventional}} <b>p–n</b> <b>diodes</b> {{used to monitor}} temperature because of their varying forward voltage with temperature, and for Peltier heat pumps for thermoelectric heating and cooling.

30|$|The {{structure}} and morphology {{of the structures}} were examined with X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Philips X’Pert Pro) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM- 840 A). The photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out at room temperature with 325  nm He-Cd laser in the wavelength rage of 350 – 1000  nm. The electrical properties of the <b>p-n</b> <b>diodes</b> were studied at room temperature by using probe station attached with semiconductor parameter analyzer.|$|R
50|$|FETs {{are divided}} into two families: {{junction}} FET (JFET) and insulated gate FET (IGFET). The IGFET is more commonly known as a metal-oxide-semiconductor FET (MOSFET), reflecting its original construction from layers of metal (the gate), oxide (the insulation), and semiconductor. Unlike IGFETs, the JFET gate forms a <b>p-n</b> <b>diode</b> with the channel which lies between the source and drain. Functionally, this makes the n-channel JFET the solid-state equivalent of the vacuum tube triode which, similarly, forms a diode between its grid and cathode. Also, both devices operate in the depletion mode, they both have a high input impedance, and they both conduct current {{under the control of}} an input voltage.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the simple}} <b>p-n</b> <b>diode</b> the forward current {{increases}} exponentially with forward bias voltage {{due to the}} exponential increase in carrier densities, so there is always some current at even very small values of applied voltage. However, if one is interested in some particular current level, it will require a [...] "knee" [...] voltage before that current level is reached. For example, a very common choice in texts about circuits using silicon diodes is VKnee = 0.7 V. Above the knee, the current continues to increase exponentially. Some special diodes, such as some varactors, are designed deliberately to maintain a low current level up to some knee voltage in the forward direction.|$|E
50|$|The above {{descriptions}} assumed {{an ideal}} diode with zero {{resistance in the}} forward direction and infinite resistance in the reverse direction. The circuit designer must concern himself with real diodes. The articles <b>p-n</b> <b>diode</b> and a less detailed article p-n junction describe the physics of the PN diode. After all the discussion of electrons, holes, majority and minority carriers etc. each come down to an equation that most directly relates to the circuit designer. The real PN diode actually has a voltage current characteristic similar to the curve on the right. A more specific definition {{can be found in}} the Shockley diode equation. The designer of a reliable diode logic circuit is usually limited to what the diode specification provides which is often less than the equation suggests. Typically the specification will primarily provide a maximum forward voltage drop at one or more forward currents and a reverse leakage current. It will also provide a maximum reverse voltage limited by zener or avalanche breakdown. Typical worst case specifications are shown below for both germanium and silicon PN diodes.|$|E

The relative advantage of the lower forward voltage of Schottky diodes is diminished at higher forward currents, where the voltage drop is dominated by the series resistance.|$|R
