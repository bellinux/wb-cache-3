40|$|Several {{studies found}} {{associations}} between exposure to airborne fungi and allergy, infection, or irritation. This study aimed to characterize airborne fungi populations present in public primary schools in Porto, Portugal, during winter through quantification and identification procedures. Fungal concentration levels and identification were obtained {{in a total}} of 73 classrooms. The AirIdeal <b>portable</b> <b>air</b> <b>sampler</b> was used in combination with chloramphenicol malt extract agar. Results showed a wide range of indoor fungi levels, with indoor concentrations higher than outdoors. The most prevalent fungi found indoors were Penicillium sp. (> 70 %) and Cladosporium sp. As evidence indicates that indoor fungal exposures plays a role in asthma clinical status, these results may contribute to (1) promoting and implementing public health prevention programs and (2) formulating recommendations aimed at providing healthier school environments.

Possible involvement has been discussed on atmospheric circulation in distributing the volatile pollutant. We developed a <b>portable</b> <b>air</b> <b>sampler</b> for the collection of mercury compounds and determined atmospheric mercury concentrations at several sites in Brazil including the basin of the Amazon tributaries. The mean concentration of total mercury was between 9. 1 and 14. 0 ng/m 3 in the basin of the Uatumã River located in the tropical rain forest far from goldmining sites and from urbanized area. These mercury levels exceeded the background level previously reported in rural area and, furthermore, were higher than concentrations observed in Rio de Janeiro and in Manaus that were compatible with the reference values for urban area. Mercury concentrations were also determined in gold refineries in the basin of the Tapajos River, and detected at a significant but not a health deteriorating level. Although only preliminary data were available, the present observations were in favor of the hypothesis that mercury is distributed widely by long distant transport by the atmospheric circulation after released at gold mining sites...|$|E

40|$|To {{measure the}} actual {{exposure}} {{of a person}} to 1 -nitropyrene (1 -NP) in airborne particulate matter, it is considered more accurate to collect air samples with a <b>portable</b> <b>air</b> <b>sampler</b> than to sample at a fixed location. However, because the portable samplers can sample only small volumes, a sensitive method is needed to analyze the compounds that are collected on a filter. Here we describe a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with fluorescence detection that is sensitive and precise enough for use with portable air samplers. The developed column-switching system successfully removed the interfering substances in the samples with only a simple pretreatment. To improve the precision of the measurement, deuterated 1 -NP {{was used as an}} internal standard, and it eluted immediately prior to 1 -NP with sufficient resolution (Rs, 1. 50). The detection limit was 0. 32 fmol/injection, and the calibration range was from 2 to 100 fmol. The proposed method was applied to determining 1 -NP in fine airborne particulate matter (PM 2. 5) at two sites with low pollution levels. 1 -NP was detected in all samples at concentrations in the low fmol/m 3 range. The proposed method has enough sensitivity and precision to determine 1 -NP in the limited air volume of the portable sampler. © 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

At the study site, air quality is poor, especially during the winter, high concentrations of pollutants being emitted primarily by the light- and heavy-duty vehicle fleet. We analyzed mass, black carbon (BC), Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, Rb, Sn, Zr, and Pb. During the polluted period, diurnal PM(10) was higher than nocturnal PM(10), whereas the inverse was true during the unpolluted period. The FPM was rich in BC, S, and Pb, whereas CPM was rich in Al, Si, Ca, Ti, and Fe. Mass balance was performed by category: ammonium sulfate, sodium chloride, crustal material, BC, and other. The PAS-determined FPM was mainly BC. The MOUDI-determined FPM crustal material explained more mass than did ammonium sulfate and BC during the polluted period, whereas ammonium sulfate had the largest mass during the unpolluted period. Crustal material was the major CPM component, followed by ammonium sulfate and BC. During the unpolluted period, FPM concentrations were lower, whereas those of ammonium sulfate were relatively higher, especially at night, and particle number was inversely proportional to particle size.

40|$|AbstractIndividual methane (CH 4) {{production}} was recorded repeatedly on 93 dairy cows during milking in an {{automatic milking system}} (AMS), {{with the aim of}} estimating individual cow differences in CH 4 production. Methane and CO 2 were measured with a <b>portable</b> <b>air</b> <b>sampler</b> and analyzer unit based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) detection. The cows were 50 Holsteins and 43 Jerseys from mixed parities and at all stages of lactation (mean= 156 d in milk). Breath was captured by the FTIR unit inlet nozzle, which was placed in front of the cow's head in each of the 2 AMS as an admixture to normal barn air. The FTIR unit was running continuously for 3 d in each of 2 AMS units, 1 with Holstein and another with Jersey cows. Air was analyzed every 20 s. From each visit of a cow to the AMS, CH 4 and CO 2 records were summarized into the mean, median, 75, and 90 % quantiles. Furthermore, the ratio between CH 4 and CO 2 was used as a derived measure with the idea of using CO 2 in breath as a tracer gas to quantify the production of methane. Methane production records were analyzed with a mixed model, containing cow as random effect. Fixed effects of milk yield and daily intake of the total mixed ration and concentrates were also estimated. The repeatability of the CH 4 -to-CO 2 ratio was 0. 39 for Holsteins and 0. 34 for Jerseys. Both concentrate intake and total mixed ration intake were positively related to CH 4 production, whereas milk production level was not correlated with CH 4 production. In conclusion, the results from this study suggest that the CH 4 -to-CO 2 ratio measured using the noninvasive method is an asset of the individual cow and may be useful in both management and genetic evaluations...|$|E

40|$|Diesel {{engine exhaust}} {{emissions}} are {{a mixture of}} gases, vapors, liquid aerosols and particulate matter that are known to increase cardiorespiratory morbidity. On July 1, 2002, a ban was imposed {{on the use of}} diesel-operated vehicles on the Lebanese territory as a public health measure. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the effect of this ban on the air concentration of particulate matter and on asthma-related morbidity in the Beirut area. Methods: <b>Air</b> <b>sampling</b> was done at multiple large intersections of Beirut before and after the ban using a <b>portable</b> high-volume <b>air</b> <b>sampler</b> equipped with glass fiber filters that capture particles of diameter greater than 0. 01 microns. Each sample was collected over a period of 30 minutes. The filter was then weighed for particulate matter determination. The records of all visits to the Emergency Room (ER) of the American University of Beirut Medical Center, a major tertiary care center in Beirut, Lebanon were reviewed over a two-year period. The first year (July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002, period 1) preceded the ban while the second year (July 1, 2002 to June 30, 2003, period 2) followed it immediately. All patients 0 - 15 years of age presenting with acute asthma were identified. Results: The average concentration of particulate matter was 181. 3 ?g/m 3 and 97. 1 ?g/m 3 before and after the ban respectively. The total numbers of ER visits for pediatric patients were 6453 and 6865 in period 1 and period 2 respectively. Of those, 313 were due to asthma in period 1 and 223 in period 2. The number of asthma-related visits was significantly reduced during period 2. When we looked at the monthly distribution of visits, asthma-related visits were significantly reduced during October, November and December of period 2 compared to the same months of period 1, while it was significantly increased during the month of June. Discussion: This study shows that a ban on diesel engine resulted in a decrease in the air concentration of particulate matter and was associated with a reduction in the number of emergency room visits for acute asthma. This reduction was most marked during the season of viral respiratory infections. We postulate that a reduction in the concentration of air pollutants was protective against viral-induced asthma exacerbations. <br/...|$|R

40|$|I have {{developed}} a novel approach to test for toxic organic substances adsorbed onto ultra fine particulate particles present in the ambient air in Northeast Houston, Texas. These particles are predominantly carbon soot with an aerodynamic diameter (AD) of 3 ̆c 2. 5 μm. If present in the ambient air, many of the organic substances will be absorbed {{to the surface of}} the particles (which act just like a charcoal air filter), and may be adducted into the respiratory system. Once imbedded into the lungs these particles may release the adsorbed toxic organic substances with serious health consequences. I used a Airmetrics <b>portable</b> Minivol <b>air</b> <b>sampler</b> time drawing the ambient air through collection filters samples from 6 separate sites in Northeast Houston, an area known for high ambient PM 2. 5 released from chemical plants and other sources (e. g. vehicle emissions). (1) In practice, the mass of the collected particles were much less than the mass of the filters. My technique was designed to release the adsorbed organic substances on the fine carbon particles by heating the filter samples that included the PM 2. 5 particles prior to identification by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS). The results showed negligible amounts of target chemicals from the collection filters. However, the filters alone released organic substances and GCMS could not distinguish between the organic substances released from the soot particles from those released from the heated filter fabric. However, an efficacy tests of my method using two wax burning candles that released soot revealed high levels of benzene. This suggests that my method has the potential to reveal the organic substances adsorbed onto the PM 2. 5 for analysis. In order to achieve this goal, I must refine the particle collection process which would be independent of the filters; the filters upon heating also release organic substances obscuring the contribution from the soot particles. To obtain pure soot particles I will have to filter more air so that the soot particles can be shaken off the filters and then analyzed by my new technique. ...|$|R

At present a fullyintegrated <b>portable</b> prototype for <b>air</b> <b>sampling</b> with disposable sensing chips and automated data acquisition has been developed. The prototype allows for fast, user-friendly sampling, which has made it possible to produce large datasets of colorimetric data for different target analytes in laboratory and simulated real-world application scenarios. To make use of the highly multi-variate data produced from the colorimetric chip a number of machine learning techniques are employed to provide reliable classification of target analytes from confounders found in the air streams. We demonstrate that a data-driven machine learning method using dimensionality reduction in combination with a probabilistic classifier makes it possible to produce informative features and a high detection rate of analytes. Furthermore, the probabilistic machine learning approach provides a means of automatically identifying unreliable measurements that could produce false predictions. The robustness of the colorimetric sensor has been evaluated in a series of experiments focusing on the amphetamine pre-cursor phenylacetone as well as the improvised explosives pre-cursor hydrogen peroxide. The analysis demonstrates that the system is able to detect analytes in clean air and mixed with substances that occur naturally in real-world sampling scenarios. The technology under development in CRIM-TRACK has the potential as an effective tool to control traf- ficking of illegal drugs, explosive detection, or in other law enforcement applications.
