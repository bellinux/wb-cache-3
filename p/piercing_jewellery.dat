5|$|Body <b>piercing</b> <b>jewellery</b> {{should be}} hypoallergenic. A number of {{materials}} are used, with varying strengths and weaknesses. Surgical stainless steel, niobium and titanium {{are commonly used}} metals, with titanium {{the least likely to}} cause allergic reaction of the three. Platinum and palladium are also safe alternatives, even in fresh piercings. Initial piercings should never be done with gold of any grade, as gold is mixed with other metals, and sterling silver is not a good alternative in a piercing, as it may cause allergies in initial piercings and will tarnish in piercings of any age. An additional risk for allergic reaction may arise when the stud or clasp of jewellery is made from a different metal than the primary piece.|$|E

40|$|We present ByzantineCAD, a feature-based {{parametric}} CAD {{system for}} designing <b>pierced</b> Byzantine <b>jewellery.</b> ByzantineCAD is an automated system where jewellery is designed {{according to the}} values of parameters and constraints that are determined by the end-user. In this paper, we introduce an approach to reproducing traditional <b>pierced</b> Byzantine <b>jewellery</b> using <b>pierced</b> voxels ("poxels "). Poxels are voxels with specific attributes and properties that are appropriately combined to create large complex pierced designs. We also present a scaling algorithm for enlarging pierced designs without altering the size of the poxels used to construct them and an algorithm for engraving arbitrary images in <b>pierced</b> <b>jewellery...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{piercing}} is rare {{due to the}} gag reflex, {{which makes}} it difficult to administer or receive it. Should <b>jewellery</b> <b>pierced</b> through the uvula come loose it may be swallowed or even inhaled, it would require surgery to remove.|$|R
50|$|One {{modification}} {{that women}} often perform of their free will {{is to have}} the hood <b>pierced</b> and insert <b>jewellery,</b> both for adornment and physical pleasure. Though much less common, other women opt to have their own hood surgically trimmed or removed so as to permanently expose part or all of the clitoral glans.|$|R

40|$|Recently an {{increasing}} number of patients with complications related to <b>pierced</b> body <b>jewellery</b> have been seen. Often removal of the jewellery is indicated. Removal of these items may also be required for radiological purposes. If the doctor is familiar with the opening mechanism of the item, removal is not usually difficult. Uninformed attempts at removal may cause unnecessary trauma and distress. In a survey of 28 accident and emergency doctors, only six were able accurately to describe the opening mechanisms of all three commonly used types of jewellery. Descriptions of the types of jewellery currently used are not available in the medical literature. The aim {{of this article is to}} familiarize doctors with the types of jewellery used, describe their opening mechanisms, and suggest techniques for their removal. The complications of body piercing and the indications for the removal of body jewellery are also outlined...|$|R
5|$|In January 2003, Canadian Brent Moffat set the World Record {{for most}} body piercings in one session (700 piercings with 18g {{surgical}} needles in 1 session of 7 hours, using play piercing where {{the skin is}} <b>pierced</b> and sometimes <b>jewellery</b> is inserted, which is worn temporarily). In December of the same year, Moffat had 900 piercings in 4Â½ hours. On 4 March 2006, the record was overturned by Kam Ma, who had 1,015 temporary metal rings inserted in 7 hours and 55 minutes. The record for most body piercings with surgical needles was set on 29 May 2008, when Robert Jesus Rubio allowed 900 18-gauge, -long surgical needles to be inserted into his body.|$|R
5000|$|Techniques or {{styles that}} {{normally}} use openwork {{include all the}} family of lace and cutwork types in textiles, including broderie anglaise and many others. Fretwork in wood is used for various types of objects. There has always been great use of openwork in jewellery, not least to save on expensive materials and weight. For example, opus interrasile {{is a type of}} decoration used in Ancient Roman and Byzantine <b>jewellery,</b> <b>piercing</b> thin strips of gold with punches. [...] Other techniques used casting with moulds, or built up the design with wire or small strips of metal. Essentially flat objects are straightforward to cast using moulds of clay or other materials, and this technique was known in ancient China since before the Shang Dynasty of c. 1600 to 1046 BC. On a larger scale in metal, wrought iron and cast iron decoration more often than not has involved openwork.|$|R

50|$|Genital {{jewellery}} includes cock {{rings and}} vaginal jewellery {{as well as}} anal piercings. These items often blur the line between jewellery and sex toys. Genital jewellery is available {{for men and women}} and some models may be worn by both sexes. While some genital piercings have been around since at least Victorian times (e.g. Prince Albert <b>piercing</b> <b>jewellery),</b> a recent increase in popularity and social acceptance has resulted in the fusion between function and fashion that is sex jewellery.|$|E
50|$|Skindiver is a {{registered}} trademark of two German companies: Marcus Strohner, Germany, and Martin Siedler, Germany. It is used for <b>piercing</b> <b>jewellery,</b> including single point implant alternatives to microdermal implants, {{as well as for}} clothing and for piercing services (trademark classes 14, 25, and 44 respectively). They may differ from microdermal implantsby having a sharp point in the area underneath the skin and permanently fixed ends, so some piercers find them to be unsatisfactory. Complications may arise with this kind of Skindivers because installation requires the use of a dermal punch, which are illegal for body piercers to use in some states.|$|E

5000|$|... 316 {{stainless}} steel, {{also referred}} to as marine grade stainless steel, is a chromium, nickel, molybdenum alloy of steel that exhibits relatively good strength and corrosion resistance. Along with the titanium alloy Ti6Al4V, 316 stainless is a common choice of material for biomedical implants. Although Ti6Al4V provides greater strength per weight and corrosion resistance, 316 stainless components can be more economical to produce. However, immune system reaction to nickel is a potential complication of 316. Implants and equipment that are put under pressure (bone fixation screws, prostheses, body piercing jewelry) are made out of austenitic steel, often 316L and 316LVM compliant to ASTM F138,.316 surgical steel is used in the manufacture and handling of food and pharmaceutical products where it is often required in order to minimize metallic contamination. ASTM F138-compliant steel is also used in the manufacture of body <b>piercing</b> <b>jewellery</b> and body modification implants.|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{addresses}} the practical and theoretical aspects of <b>piercing</b> <b>jewellery</b> and related accoutrements. The practical part describes {{the design and}} construction {{of a series of}} ceramic jewellery boxes for <b>piercing</b> <b>jewellery.</b> These three boxes are functional and unique jewellery in their own right. The theoretical part of this thesis examines body piercing art, piercing techniques and <b>piercing</b> <b>jewellery.</b> A visual section displays the <b>piercing</b> <b>jewellery</b> and documents the making of the jewellery boxes and their final design...|$|E
