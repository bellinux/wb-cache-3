50|$|In {{practical}} terms, {{autonomy for}} {{the board of trustees}} is nominal. Central Government has overriding powers. Until around the mid-1960s trade union leaders representing labour employed in the port used to be nominated though to a limited extent, to the board of trustees. Such labour used to be employed in large scale inside port area and on board the ships by ship-owners and cargo owners through their agencies operating in the port. The labour thus employed has casual employment relations with their employers. At the same time, cooperation of this labour was very essential for smooth functioning of the port. The <b>Civil</b> <b>servants,</b> who are <b>permanent</b> employees, covered under Central Government's conduct regulations were transferred to Port Trust to perform regulatory and service functions of ports when board of trustees was established. In course of time, by the early 1990s the representatives of <b>permanent</b> <b>civil</b> <b>servants</b> thus being employed under port trust as permanent employees began to be nominated as 'labour employed in the port'. Another development was introduction of new methods of cargo handling in ports. This development caused massive displacement of casual labour employed in the port by ship-owners ad cargo owners through their agencies. Notwithstanding this development, the nature of function of a port is such that it can only act as interface between ship and cargo.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{continuing}} discussion in Indonesia {{about the need}} for improved information on human resources for health at the district level where programs are actually delivered. This is particularly the case after a central government decision to offer doctors, nurses and midwives on contract the chance to convert to <b>permanent</b> <b>civil</b> service status. Our objective here is to report changes between 2006 and 2008 in numbers and employment status of health staff in three districts following the central government decision. Methods Information was derived from records at the district health office and, where necessary for clarification, discussions with district officials. Results Across the three districts and all public sector provider categories there was an increase of almost 680 providers between 2006 and 2008 - more than 300 nurses, more than 300 midwives and 25 doctors. The increases for permanent public servants were proportionately much greater (43 %) than the total (16 %). The increase in those who are <b>permanent</b> <b>civil</b> <b>servants</b> was greatest for nurses (51 %) and midwives (35 %) with corresponding decreases in the proportion of staff on contract. There was considerable variation between the three districts. Conclusions There has been {{a significant increase in the}} number of healthcare providers in the 3 districts surveyed and the proportion now permanent public servants has increased even more than the increase in total numbers. The changes have the effect of increasing the proportion of total public expenditure allocated to salaries and reducing the flexibility of the districts in managing their own budgets. Because public servants are allowed private practice outside office hours there has also been an increase in the number of private practice facilities offering health care. These changes illustrate the need for a much improved human resources information system and a coherent policy to guide actions on human resources for health at the national, provincial and district levels. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{two most}} senior civil service roles {{at the top}} of {{government}} have in recent decades been filled by the same individual. As head of the civil service, Lord Turnbull was akin to {{the chief executive of the}} organisation, though the lines of reporting are somewhat more complex than is typical in the private sector since <b>Permanent</b> Secretaries (senior <b>civil</b> <b>servants</b> within each department of government) report to ministers. As Cabinet Secretary, a post created in 1916, Turnbull was responsible for the organisation of the Cabinet Office, providing support to the Prime Minister and to the government as a whole. When Turnbull succeeded to the dual role on 2 September 2002, Prime Minister Tony Blair asked him to focus on the management of the civil service, and to make its reorganisation his priority.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{village midwife}} {{is a central}} element of Indonesia's {{strategy}} to improve {{maternal and child health}} and family planning services. Recently there has been concern that the midwives were not present in the villages to which they had been assigned. To {{determine the extent to which}} this was the case we conducted a field-based census and survey of village midwives in three districts in West Java Province, Indonesia. Findings In June 2009 we interviewed a random sample of village midwives from three districts - Ciamis, Garut and Sukabumi - in West Java Province. Trained interviewers visited all villages represented in the sample to interview the midwives. We also obtained information about the midwives and their professional activities in the last year. Thirty percent of village midwives had moved to another location in the 12 months between the end of 2008, when the sampling frame was constructed, and December 2009 when the survey was conducted; most had moved to a government health center or another village. Of those who were present, there was considerable variation between districts in age distribution and qualifications. The total number of services provided was modest, also with considerable variation between districts. The median number of deliveries assisted in the last year was 64; the amount and mix of family planning services provided varied between districts and were dominated by temporary methods. Conclusions Compared to an earlier survey in an adjacent province, the village midwives in these three districts were younger, had spent less time in the village and a higher proportion were <b>permanent</b> <b>civil</b> <b>servants.</b> A high proportion had moved in the previous year with most moving to a health center or another village. The decision to move, as well as the mix of services offered, seems to be largely driven by opportunities to increase their private practice income. These opportunities are greater in urban areas. As urbanization procedes the forces drawing village midwives away from the village are certain to strengthen. This will require a reassessment of the original service model embodied in the village midwife concept and a new approach to reducing maternal mortality. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Standard {{definition}} is too narrow [...] If politics includes {{all of what}} we know as policy making, then the dichotomy would bar administrators, presumably including city managers, from participation. The dichotomy of policy and administration was a conceptual distinction underlying a theory of democratic accountability. It was not intended to guide behavior, it was intended as a behavioral prescription directed against contemporary practices of machine politics.The strict {{definition is}} the model. It is not conceptually possible to have a one way dichotomy that keeps elected official out of administration but allows administrators to be active in policy. The dichotomy model standing alone is an aberration. Arguably the father of American political administration, Wilson, in his essay 'The Study of Administration', suggested that in order to have objectivity and progress, the administration must be separate from politics ... The political/administration dichotomy aimed to separate the power between political leaders and the merit-based appointment of professional <b>permanent</b> <b>civil</b> <b>servants</b> in the administrative state ... At the turn of the 20th century, the field focused on making the bureaucracy more effective ... The fieldâ€™s basic premise was to take a business-like approach to government and its activities. [...] By Wilson making the statement, [...] "Government should be run like a business," [...] he thereby opened up many loop holes for the capitalist society to exploit the government for things they didnâ€™t actually have. This statement ends in a very dangerous uncharted territory for people now. Based on the fact government could be run like a business. The concept [...] "everyone has a boss" [...] with creating the business like mindset running our country it makes everyone have to answer to someone (higher on the totem pole) than the other, it creates a sense of working for your job when you are supposed to be working for the people whom you represent. So now, instead of implementing policy to help the people, administrators and politicians are more concerned about who is funding/appointing than they are worried about the common man. That isnâ€™t just the biggest problem for Politic administration Dichotomy it is a huge problem for the sustainability of our government and the world.|$|R
