I use data on mutual fund holdings to construct a new measure of reference <b>purchasing</b> <b>prices</b> for individual stocks, and I show that post-announcement price drift is most severe whenever capital gains and the news event have the same sign. The magnitude of the drift depends on the capital gains (losses) experienced by the stock holders on the event date.

40|$|Using unique brand-level {{wholesale}} price data, {{this article examines}} how purchase prices of commodities for retailers are influenced by wholesale concentration. Compared with studies focusing on retail prices, little empirical work has measured the impact of wholesale concentration on {{wholesale price}}s. Economic theory suggests that the sensitivity of purchase price in response to degree of wholesale concentration is smaller for large retail formats than for small retail formats {{in the presence of}} intra-format retail competition. To test the validity of the theoretical implication, I measure the impact of the concentration on <b>purchasing</b> <b>prices</b> for retailers by format. Empirical findings support the hypothesis that the large retail format tends to draw advantageous purchase prices when wholesalers become increasingly oligopolistic. ...|$|E

40|$|I {{examine the}} {{negotiation}} of accounting rules in the <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> adjustment clause of corporate acquisition agreements. <b>Purchase</b> <b>price</b> adjustments make the deal value contingent on the target's closing working capital or net worth. Some <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> adjustments use "rigid" accounting and specify which measurement rules {{will be used to}} prepare the closing-date balance sheet. Many more use "flexible" accounting and require only GAAP compliance. I provide evidence that hidden action and adverse selection problems determine whether the buyer and seller use rigid or flexible accounting. I also provide evidence that this choice is associated with other features of the contract related to <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> adjustment flexibility and to the prospect of hold-up. Estimates of the effect of rigid accounting on finalized <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> adjustments are consistent with implications of the adverse selection and hold-up problems. by Derek Christopher Johnson.
