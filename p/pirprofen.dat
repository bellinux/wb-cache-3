50|$|<b>Pirprofen</b> was a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) {{that was}} brought to market by Ciba-Geigy in 1982 {{as a treatment for}} arthritis and pain. Its label was restricted after adverse events arose, including some cases of fatal liver toxicity. Ciba-Geigy voluntarily withdrew the drug from the market worldwide in 1990.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pirprofen</b> (a new non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} agent), 200 mg 8 hourly, or placebo {{was administered}} orally to eight normal volunteers to investigate {{its effect on}} the pharmacokinetics and glucose and insulin responses after 1 mg i. v. glibenclamide. No significant changes were produced in these measures and in vitro studies showed no displacement of glibenclamide by <b>pirprofen</b> from plasma protein binding...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{with sports}} {{injuries}} {{were treated with}} <b>pirprofen,</b> a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, in two separate studies. In the single centre study, 39 athletes were treated with 1000 mg/day <b>pirprofen</b> for 2 weeks. In the multicentre study, a further 80 athletes were treated with a variable dosage (600 - 1200 mg/day) until the disappearance of symptoms, but for no longer than 2 weeks. Efficacy was considered excellent or good in 99 / 119 (83 %) of the patients treated. The clinical variables of pain and mobility significantly (P< 0. 05) improved after 1 week of treatment. Tolera-bility was satisfactory, the main side-effects involving the gastro-intestinal tract. KEY WORDS: Pirprofen; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; sports injuries...|$|E
40|$|Although many steatogenic drugs inhibit {{mitochondrial}} {{fatty acid}} -oxidation, limited {{information is available}} on possible effects on hepatic lipoprotein secretion. In the endo-plasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) lipidates apolipoprotein B (Apo B), to form triglyceride (TG) -rich very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, which follow vesicular flow to the plasma membrane to be secreted, whereas incompletely lipidated Apo B particles are partly degraded. We studied hepatic MTP activity, the lipoproteins present in the ER lumen, and hepatic lipoprotein secretion 4 hours after administration of a single dose of amineptine (1 mmol/kg), amiodarone (1 mmol/kg), doxycycline (0. 25 mmol/kg), tetracycline (0. 25 mmol/kg), tianeptine (0. 5 mmol/ kg), or <b>pirprofen</b> (2 mmol/kg) in mice. These various doses have been shown previously to markedly inhibit fatty acid oxidation after a single dose, and to trigger steatosis either after repeated doses (doxycycline) or a single dose (other compounds) in mice. In the present study, amineptine, amiodarone, <b>pirprofen,</b> tetracycline, and tianeptine, but not doxycycline, inhibited MTP activity in vitro, decreased ex vivo MTP activity in the hepatic homogenate of treated mice, decreased TG in the luminal VLDL fraction of hepatic microsomes of treate...|$|E
40|$|Seven non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs), i. e. carprofen, flurbiprofen, fenoprofen, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen and <b>pirprofen,</b> and {{mandelic acid}} were enantiomerically separated on a commercially available Kromasil CHI-TBB chiral stationary phase by high performance liquid chromatography in normal mode. It {{was found that}} mobile phase additives could tune the chiral separation factors and retention time of the solutes. Larger chiral separation factors (a) and longer retention time (t(R)) were generated by adding weaker polar additives, and smaller chiral separation factors and shorter retention time by adding stronger polar additives. Therefore, {{it is possible to}} modify the composition of the mobile phase for achieving different purposes...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} case of a 32 -year-old male who {{suffered}} from severe RA from the age of 21 years After 9 years of active disease and poor response to therapy the patient developed severe hepatitis induced by the NSAID <b>pirprofen.</b> He went into fulminant hepatic failure necessitating emergency liver transplantation. Liver transplantation was followed by clinical and laboratory remission of his RA and he has remained virtually asymptomatic for more than 3. 5 years. The possibility that this favourable clinical course was due to the immunosuppressive effect of the liver transplant rather than the ensuing immunosuppressive therapy is discussed. KEY WORDS: Rheumatoid arthritis, Liver transplantation, Immunosuppression, Cyclosporin, Corticosteroids. REMISSION of severe RA is usually transient and incom-plete. This is true both for spontaneous and thera-peutically-induced remissions. We have observed a complete and long-lasting remission, in a young patient with a 9 yr history of RA, following liver transplanta-tion necessitated by pirprofeh-induced hepatic failure.
