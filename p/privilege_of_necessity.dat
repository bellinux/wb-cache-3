5000|$|Private {{necessity}} {{is the use}} of another's {{property for}} private reasons. Well established doctrines in common law prevent a property owner from using force against an individual in a situation where the <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> would apply. While an individual may have a private necessity to use the land or property of another, that individual must compensate the owner for any damages caused. For example: ...|$|E
50|$|In American law, {{the case}} most often cited {{to explain the}} <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> private <b>necessity</b> is Vincent v. Lake Erie Transp. Co., 109 Minn. 456, 124 N.W. 221 (1910).|$|R
50|$|If Paula had damaged Dave's dock, {{she would}} be liable for it, even though she has a valid <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> private <b>necessity.</b> More importantly, Dave is now liable to Paula for the damage to her boat and for her {{personal}} injuries. Because <b>of</b> the private <b>necessity,</b> Paula is not considered a trespasser. So, Dave did not in fact have a valid <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> defense of property.|$|R
50|$|Ordinarily, {{for private}} {{necessity}} to be valid, the party attempting to exercise {{it must not}} have created the emergency. For example, if Paula intentionally punctures her fuel tank just so she can race over to Dave's dock and tie up, she {{will not have a}} valid <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> private <b>necessity.</b> As such, she would be a trespasser, and Dave would have a valid <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> defense of property.|$|R
50|$|A {{strong wind}} blows a {{parachuting}} skydiver off course from his intended landing zone. He must {{land in a}} nearby farmer's field. The skydiver tramples on the farmer's prized roses, and the farmer hits the skydiver {{on the head with}} a pitchfork. The skydiver can invoke the <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> private <b>necessity</b> for trespassing in the farmer's fields but will {{have to pay for the}} damage caused to the roses. The farmer will be liable for battery because the use of force in defense of property is not privileged against an individual who successfully claims private necessity.|$|R
2500|$|Newman {{held that}} [...] "freedom from symbols and {{articles}} is abstractedly the highest state of Christian communion", but was [...] "the peculiar <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> the primitive Church." [...] In 1877 he allowed that [...] "in {{a religion that}} embraces large and separate classes of adherents there always is <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> {{to a certain extent}} an exoteric and an esoteric doctrine." ...|$|R
25|$|When {{the formal}} claim <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> was {{filed by the}} Secretary, under the {{circumstances}} indicating a reasonable possibility that military secrets were involved, there was a sufficient showing <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> to cut off further demand for the documents on the showing <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> for its compulsion that had been made.|$|R
50|$|Moral {{theology}} {{permits a}} priest to say two Masses on Sundays and Holy Days of obligation, in care <b>of</b> <b>necessity,</b> when, namely, {{a number of}} faithful would otherwise be deprived of the opportunity of hearing Mass. This would be verified, for example, were a priest in charge of two parishes or missions with no other celebrant available, or were the church too small to accommodate at one time all the parishioners. The ordinary of the diocese, however, is to judge, in these and similar cases, <b>of</b> the <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> binating. For similar cause, Rome grants to priests of missionary countries the <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> saying two Masses.|$|R
50|$|In tort common law, {{the defense}} <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> gives {{the state or}} an {{individual}} a privilege to take or use the property of another. A defendant typically invokes the defense <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> only against the intentional torts of trespass to chattels, trespass to land, or conversion. The Latin phrase from common law is necessitas inducit privilegium quod jura privata ("Necessity induces a <b>privilege</b> because <b>of</b> a private right"). A court will grant this privilege to a trespasser when the risk of harm to an individual or society is apparently and reasonably greater than the harm to the property. Unlike the <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> self-defense, those who are harmed by individuals invoking the necessity privilege are usually free from any wrongdoing. Generally, an individual invoking this privilege is obligated to pay any actual damages caused {{in the use of}} the property but not punitive or nominal damages.|$|R
5000|$|Lingard himself {{argued that}} one of his chief duties as an {{historian}} was: [...] "to weigh with care the value of the authorities on which I rely, and to watch with jealousy the secret workings of my own personal feelings and prepossessions. Such vigilance is a matter <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> to every writer of history ... Otherwise, he will be continually tempted to make an unfair use <b>of</b> the <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> the historian; he will sacrifice the interests of truth to the interests of party, national, or religious, or political."

5|$|The <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> peerage {{extends to}} all {{temporal}} peers and peeresses {{regardless of their}} position {{in relation to the}} House of Lords. The right to sit in the House is separate from the privilege, and is held by only some peers (see History of reform of the House of Lords). Scottish peers from the Acts of Union 1707 and Irish peers from the Act of Union 1800, therefore, have the <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> peerage. From 1800, Irish peers have had the right to stand for election to the United Kingdom House of Commons but they lose the <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> peerage for the duration of their service in the lower House. Since 1999, hereditary peers of England, Scotland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom who are not members of the House of Lords may stand for election to the House <b>of</b> Commons. Their <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> peerage is not explicitly lost by service in the lower House. Any peer issuing a disclaimer under the provisions of the Peerage Act 1963 loses all <b>privileges</b> <b>of</b> peerage. The <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> peerage also extends to wives and widows of peers. A peeress by marriage loses the privilege upon marrying a commoner, but a peeress suo jure does not. Individuals who hold courtesy titles, however, do not have such <b>privileges</b> by virtue <b>of</b> those titles. Lords Spiritual (the 26 Archbishops and Bishops who sit in the House of Lords) do not have the <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> peerage as, at least since 1621, they have been Lords of Parliament, and not peers.|$|R
