40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} whether the <b>presentation</b> <b>medium</b> of corporate social and environmental web site disclosure has an impact on user trust in such disclosure, and to examine the effect of media richness on user perception about corporate social and environmental responsibility. Design/methodology/approach – The paper's methodology is a three-by-two between-subjects design experiment, manipulating <b>presentation</b> <b>medium</b> and industry type. Participants viewed social and environmental web site disclosures and completed and communicated their perceptions of trust and the experimental companies' corporate social responsibility. Findings – The <b>presentation</b> <b>medium</b> richness of social and environmental web site disclosures is positively associated with: trusting intentions, but not trusting beliefs, of web site users; and user perception of corporate social and environmental responsibility. Research limitations/implications – As with all controlled experiments, the research design focused on internal validity to maintain control over the task design, manipulation, and measurement of variables. While this required trade-offs with external validity, the task was designed based on real-world scenarios to maintain high levels of external validity within the experimental setting. Practical implications – The paper provides evidence that corporations could use enhanced web-based technology to potentially mislead users regarding their performance in the social domain. Originality/value – The paper extends the visual disclosure literature by examining the richness of the image/visual media, and investigates whether user perceptions are impacted by the variations in its richness.

40|$|There is {{a current}} vacillation in {{choosing}} hand or computer for design presentation in academia. Although the computer emerged as very powerful alternative <b>presentation</b> <b>medium,</b> {{it could not}} sweep away the hand totally. Believing that this vacillation cannot only {{be due to the}} positive and negative aspects of both media, we worked with a group of students in a design curriculum to observe the factors that affect their choice of medium for presenting design ideas. The students were required to use both media for the same task, subsequently their satisfaction and evaluation were examined through a questionnaire. Students acknowledged the positive aspects of both media, rather than accumulating on one side. Findings led us to concur that the constant oscillation of architecture between art and science penetrates down to the individual choice of <b>presentation</b> <b>medium.</b> We assert that the warmness of hand is not deserted as it contemplates the artistic essence, while the digital perfection of the computers flirt with science. The ever-attended, age-old question of architecture's being art and/or science occupies the architectural agenda at various levels. Both the polarizations and the reconciliations have theoretical, practical and educational consequences. This paper locates itself within this context and proposes a new framework for analyzing the impacts of this oscillation in design presentation, concluding that the future of presentation in education points to the coexistence of both media. © Springer 2006...|$|E

40|$|The {{presentation}} of Holocaust memory {{is a deeply}} contested topic that regularly appears in contemporary scholarly debates. Film has become particularly important in these discussions due to factors ranging from its use of diverse aesthetic mediums to its immense popularity in American culture. However, while Holocaust film {{has been the subject}} of a substantial body of literature, music, a key element of film, has gone virtually unnoticed. Unlike previous inquiries, my thesis addresses this lacuna, focusing specifically on the role of music in Holocaust film. In this thesis, I argue that music plays a crucial role in Holocaust films through its interaction with other aesthetic mediums. More specifically, focusing on the genre of Holocaust documentary film, I explore how music can elicit diverse affective responses, resulting in the creation of two distinctive types of aesthetic presentations that I describe as monolithic and polylithic. As I will discuss, I understand these terms in the following manner: Monolithic aesthetic presentation: an aesthetic <b>presentation</b> that employs <b>mediums</b> in such a way that a cohesive set of affective responses is produced. Polylithic aesthetic presentation: an aesthetic <b>presentation</b> that employs <b>mediums</b> in such a way that a set of clashing and conflicting affective responses is produced. As I demonstrate throughout my thesis, music’s role in the creation of these two types of aesthetic presentations proves to be a powerful element in the production of meaning, allowing Holocaust documentary films to make particular claims about how the Holocaust has been and can be experienced...|$|R

40|$|Landscape scenic {{preference}} {{based on}} user input {{is an important}} element in planning decisions. On-site observation is generally not the most efficient method. As a consequence, various landscape simulations have been used including black and white pictures, color pictures, color slides, models, and 16 mm film. Recognizing the need to simulate the landscape for user preference testing, the limitations of the presentation media currently being utilized were investigated. Shuttleworth (1980) discussed three possible limitations with photographic simulations: the restrictive field of vision found in a camera, the lack of three-dimensional objects and movement and the need to include landscape elements to resolve conflicts of where objects are in the landscape. Video was selected as the focus of this research because it was a medium which might mitigate the problems found in the use of other media. It was tested against an established <b>presentation</b> <b>medium</b> in the form of slides. Four formats were developed to test forty rural Indiana landscape scenes. All of the thirty respondents in the study participated in the landscape scenic preference testing using slides. The same group was then randomly assigned to three video formats for the second day of testing. Thethree video formats were video pan with sound (video pan is the rotation of the camera on its axis for ninety degrees), video pan without sound, and video hold (video hold is a focus on a particular scene for five to eight seconds). The respondents preference ratings were analyzed using three approaches: Analysis of Variance, Mean ratings of the various scenes, and a questionnaire. The results of this study clearly indicate that video pan with sound is the most accurate <b>presentation</b> <b>medium</b> than can be used to elicit observers' responses to landscape scenery. In addition, this study also suggests that video could {{have a major impact on}} understanding observers' preferences and revolutionize current approaches to understanding human behavior in the areas of planning and design.

40|$|Abstract This article {{presents}} findings {{from a recent}} study into the ways young people are engaging with the social networking site Facebook. It draws on a qualitative, small-scale study with six 13 and 14 year old girls who have been using Facebook daily for two years. It aimed to explore {{the nature of their}} critical understanding of the medium in ways that have been obscured by research and popular discussion that assume a simple dichotomy between ‘digital natives’ and others. In order to analyse results, Foucault’s theory of discursive formation is used as a framework through which the motivations behind the behaviours presented might be understood. Results suggest {{that there are a number}} of factors that make critical engagement difficult in this context. First, coupling the highly visual nature of the medium with an essentially ‘invisible audience’ made participants anxious about ‘fitting in’ to the discourse, which ultimately limited the scope of their use. Second, because social networking is strongly linked with identity <b>presentation</b> critiquing the <b>medium</b> would require an analysis of personal identity. Finally, to critique the site requires the individual to stand ‘outside’ the discourse, which essentially counters the reason for using Facebook.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis examines the issues surrounding the collection and dissemination of customer ergonomics requirements in the automotive industry. The {{aim of the research}} is to develop a Toolset of methods, known as the Lifestyle Scenario Toolset, for gathering customer requirements in overseas markets, and for presenting the information collected to design teams, taking a user-centred design approach. The Toolset was developed and evaluated with the co-operation of employees from a major UK automotive company. Four studies were conducted, the first comprised a series of interviews to establish the needs of both the data gatherers and data users for a Toolset of methods to collect and communicate overseas customer information. The data gatherers were drawn from the company's Market Researchers, Ergonomists and people responsible for the company's overseas operations. The data users were the design team responsible {{for the development of the}} company's next generation 4 X 4 vehicle. Results showed that the data collection tools which formed part I of the Toolset should be quick to use, require no ergonomics expertise to implement and be cost effective to use. The interviews with data users identified the need for tools which could communicate customer ergonomics requirements to them in a way which fitted in with their current working practices. In addition the tools needed to communicate information in language which was familiar to the design team, and be visually based where possible. The second study explored the development of suitable data collection tools for inclusion in the Lifestyle Scenario Toolset. Building on the needs identified in the first study together with information from the current literature a number of data collection tools were developed for inclusion in part I of the Lifestyle Scenario Toolset. These tools were a questionnaire, driving diary and photographs, focus group, ergonomics audit and background information tool. The tools were designed to collect a range of different data types, e. g. qualitative, quantitative, pictorial and customer verbatims, to provide a rich picture of users and their activities. The tools were used in a field trial to collect data from overseas customers about their ergonomics requirements and the tasks they carried out using their vehicle, in the context of their lifestyle. The third study focused on the development of a set of tools to communicate the data collected in part 1 of the Toolset, to the design team who would use it in their work. The data communication tools were developed to provide information to design teams at a number of levels, enabling them to use the data at an appropriate level for their needs. High level summaries of each of the tools were developed and scenarios presented on storyboards were used to integrate information from all of the data collection tools to provide detailed information about customers' ergonomics requirements and lifestyle. The data communication tools also used a variety of data types and <b>presentation</b> <b>mediums,</b> such as pictures, graphs and customer quotes to increase the richness of the data presented. The fourth study involved the evaluation of the suitability of the Toolset for collecting and communicating overseas customer ergonomics requirements. The data gatherers, and data users (design team) carried out a field trial using the Toolset to establish its usefulness to them in their work. The results of the evaluation showed that the data gatherers found the Toolset easy to implement and were able to use it to pick up overseas customers ergonomics requirements. The communication tools were able to provide the design team with new and useful customer ergonomics information, in a range of formats which they felt comfortable using in their work. The implementation of a user-centred design approach to the development of methods for collecting and communicating overseas customer ergonomics requirements enabled the creation of a Toolset which met the needs of the people who will use it. This increased its acceptance by people in the company and thus the likelihood of the Lifestyle Scenario Toolset's continued use within the company...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} both {{conventional and}} computational ways of expressing and exploring design concepts {{with the use}} of models. We explain the role and function of the model in the design process, and investigate the ways in which models become reflections and representations of architects design thinking. We compare and contrast the physical properties of conventional models with those of three-dimensional computer models, and the corresponding processes of model creation, model development, and model modification. The paper includes a brief overview of commonly used forms of computer representations often encountered in Computer Aided Design applications. Whatever the visual richness of computer models in virtual environments can be, we believe that, just as in the use of conventional two-dimensional architectural drawings, computational presentations of architectural design concepts have their own conventions of use. This paper addresses the need to more accurately understand these conventions of using computer models for the representation of architectural design concepts. Therefore, we will illustrate the more dynamic qualities of computer models, which have the potential to allow designers to escape from the restrictions and constraints of physical form. In particular, we demonstrate these qualities in the context of architectural <b>presentations</b> in the <b>medium</b> of computer animation. These new forms of expression of design thoughts and ideas go beyond mere model making, and move more towards scene making and storytelling. The latter represents new methods of expression within computational environments for architects and designers...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In 1981 the author submitted that "many of the (then) more recent school syllabuses remain disjointed and give expression still to a school mathematics course as step-by-step progression through a list of disparate topics". The position has not changed. It is not yet generally accepted that there {{can no longer be}} an accepted body of mathematical knowledge that needs to be taught. The rapid development of new technology and the introduction of the microcomputer should enable the 'modern' mathematics of the early 1960 's to enhance the mathematical experiences of pupils in a practical and comprehensible way and prompt a new style of teaching and learning mathematics. There is, however, a fundamental core of mathematics which must inevitably find a place in the school mathematics curriculum. In Part I of the thesis the emphasis is on a method of presentation of certain key topics which illustrate the basic pattern of a group structure. Former complications at school level of putting plane geometry on a logical footing have to be avoided. The use of complex numbers highlights significant and sometimes rather difficult geometrical ideas. In Part 11 the author attempts to show how some of these ideas may be presented to extend the basic pattern to that of linear algebra. The work culminates in Part III with the use of linear complex algebra to present more vividly the symmetries of the Platonic solids. The author anticipates the realistic presentation of the aesthetic side of 3 -dimensional geometry and takes a look at its possible <b>presentation</b> through the <b>medium</b> of the microcomputer. At this early stage of the development of the ideas to be discussed, there can be no formal testing of the results by quantitative analysis. Evaluation of the viability of the proposals will be qualitative and the comments of 'critical academic friends' will be included. The originality demanded of a piece of research goes beyond the exposition. Here it will consist of new insights into ideas appropriate to senior pupils in schools and a rewriting of existing material often thought to be beyond their scope. The work is supported by suggested lesson sequences, transcripts of recorded presentations, and examples of students' work. Subsequent development must face the question of assessment and evaluation at sixth-form level of the proposed new style of teaching mathematics. The author makes some suggestions in the concluding chapter...|$|R
40|$|My thesis {{objective}} is to explore the development of one 2 ̆ 7 s self image and sense of identity {{in the absence of}} the traditional familial role models. Some of what I expect to address is the loss of my mother in my teens and the subsequent impact on my personal development, as well as my father 2 ̆ 7 s disapproval and disparagement of all but my academic successes prior to his first stroke, in my early teens. The work will consist of portrait paintings and drawings of myself and family members, plus figurative paintings and prints based on myself and live models. What I hope for is for the viewer to be able to find common ground with my formative experiences through this visual presentation. I find that my long-standing emotional and intellectual attraction to Expressionism and subsequent studies into the lives and works of expressionistic painters has played a highly influential role in my personal development as a painter. This long-held fascination with Expressionism has resulted in a great deal of experimentation with color and mark-making as I worked on the pieces for my thesis. My classical study and training provides me with a strong base from which to spring with my expressionistic forays. Use of expressionistic color and form relationships bestows me with a greater range of tools with which to create my own emotional and psychological <b>presentation</b> through the <b>mediums</b> of painting and printmaking. The content of my work should carry a universality to the viewer. Though the specifics vary, the majority of families damage their members in various ways, both intentionally and inadvertantly. This work is meant to incite the viewer into an examination of one 2 ̆ 7 s personal familial experience, thus opening the door to empathize and understand others more fully. The process of creating this body of work has had the unforeseen result of propelling me into a much closer, more painful examination of my self and my life than I had expected, as well as resulting in the need for counselling to address some of these issues. This thesis has therefore become an integral part of my healing process; through this personal examination arose some uncomfortable realities requiring resolution and acceptance in order for me to come to terms with who I am and the generation of that identity. It is my hope that some of this struggle is apparent in the work, thereby striking a chord of shared experience with the viewer...|$|R
