40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{describes}} a novel transformer less grid connected ANN based <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> with negative grounding for a photovoltaic generation system. The negative terminal {{of the solar}} cell array can be directly connected {{to the ground in}} the proposed grid-connected <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> to avoid the transparent conducting oxide corrosion that occurs in some types of thin-film solar cell array. The proposed grid-connected <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> consists of a dc–dc <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> and a dc–ac inverter. The salient features of the proposed <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> are that some power electronic switches are simultaneously used in both the dc–dc <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> and dc–ac inverter, and only two power electronic switches operate at high switching frequency at the same time (one is in the dc– dc <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> and the other is in the dc–ac inverter). The leakage current of the photovoltaic generation system is reduced because the negative terminal of the solar cell array is connected directly to the ground. Finally, a prototype was developed to verify the performance of the proposed grid- connected <b>power</b> <b>converter.</b> Performance of the proposed ANN based grid-connected <b>power</b> <b>converter</b> is verified using MATLAB/SIMULINK.
