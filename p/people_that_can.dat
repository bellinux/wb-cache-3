From the seventeenth century they were used as a literary form by aristocratic authors including Robert Sempill (c. 1595-c. 1665), Lady Elizabeth Wardlaw (1627–1727) and Lady Grizel Baillie (1645–1746).|$|E

Scottish ballads are distinct, showing pre-Christian influences in the inclusion of supernatural elements such as the fairies in the Scottish ballad [...] "Tam Lin". They remained an oral tradition until the increased interest in folk songs in the eighteenth century led collectors such as Bishop Thomas Percy to publish volumes of popular ballads. The oppression of secular music and dancing began to ease between about 1715 and 1725 and the level of musical activity was reflected in a flood of musical publications in broadsheets and compendiums of music such as the makar Allan Ramsay's verse compendium The Tea Table Miscellany (1723) and William Thomson's Orpheus Caledonius (1725).|$|E

LP - Gil Scott-Heron and Jamie xx]. Insound. Retrieved on 2011-07-28. After its success, Jamie xx had occupied himself with solo production work, remixing other artists, and DJing in clubs in the United Kingdom and Europe.

Russell later said of his decision to enlist him, [...] "We didn't want lots of remixes by different <b>people.</b> <b>That</b> <b>can</b> be confusing.

500|$|Before {{production}} {{on the second}} season began, Murphy confirmed that Kurt would be paired with a new romantic interest. According to Chord Overstreet, his character Sam Evans was originally intended to become Kurt's love interest.

Kurt was subsequently paired with another new character, Blaine Anderson, {{a member of the}} rival show choir group the Dalton Academy Warblers, who is initially a mentor for Kurt. Murphy was unsure at first whether their relationship would become a romantic one, and stated that he wished to gauge public response to their friendship before planning future developments. He commented, [...] "Part of me thinks he should be the boyfriend, part of me thinks he should just be the mentor. I didn't want to decide that until we got into sort of the middle of the season." [...] Kurt transfers from McKinley High to Dalton Academy and falls in love with Blaine, though Blaine only considers him a close friend. However, when Kurt sings the Beatles song [...] "Blackbird" [...] in [...] "Original Song", Blaine finally realizes his true feelings and the two kiss, marking the start of the relationship. Criss noted, [...] "We all want to see Kurt happy, and like all great love stories, if you have two <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be together you've got to hold it up." [...] When imagining Blaine and Kurt's potential future together, Murphy expected to treat them the same as all other Glee relationships by making their pairing [...] "as flawed and as exposed as everyone else's." [...] This plan was confirmed by Falchuk after the characters kissed for the first time, though he later clarified: [...] "They're solid. They have problems—you have two stars dating each other, there's going to be some competition there."
