5|$|In chapter five Goldacre {{suggests}} {{using the}} General Practice Research Database in the UK, which contains the anonymized records of several million <b>patients,</b> <b>to</b> conduct randomized trials {{to determine the}} most effective of competing treatments. For example, to compare two statins, atorvastatin and simvastatin, doctors would randomly assign <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> one or the other. The patients would be followed up by having data about their cholesterol levels, heart attacks, strokes and deaths taken from their computerized medical records. The trials would not be blind– patients would know which statin they had been prescribed– but Goldacre writes {{that they would be}} unlikely to hold such firm beliefs about which one is preferable {{to the extent that it}} could affect their health.|$|E
5|$|Patient {{transport}} ambulance – A vehicle, {{which has}} the job of transporting <b>patients</b> <b>to,</b> from or between places of medical treatment, such as hospital or dialysis center, for non-urgent care. These can be vans, buses or other vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Silicon {{is present}} in silatrane, a highly toxic rodenticide. Long-term {{inhalation}} of silica dust causes silicosis, a fatal disease of the lungs. Silicon is an essential trace element. Silicone gel {{can be applied to}} badly burned <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> reduce scarring.|$|E
50|$|Each {{of these}} factors may vary from <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> <b>patient</b> (inter-individual variation), and indeed in the same patient over time (intra-individual variation). In {{clinical}} trials, inter-individual variation is a critical measurement {{used to assess the}} bioavailability differences from <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> <b>patient</b> in order <b>to</b> ensure predictable dosing.|$|R

50|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} (PE) is a {{best practice}} PTSD treatment that repeatedly exposes the <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> triggers or distressful thoughts {{related to the}} traumatic event, allowing the <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> learn how to manage resulting distress and deal with memories that had been avoided. Exposure therapy is performed at Emory Brain Health Center using virtual reality sessions with a therapist, allowing the <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> talk through experiences.|$|R
5|$|The Commission {{recommended}} that criminal patients be kept {{apart from other}} patients, thus male criminally insane patients were moved to J Ward of the Ararat Asylum and female dangerous <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> Sunbury Asylum.|$|E

5|$|The {{other related}} issue {{concerned}} advance-care planning consultation: {{a section of}} the House reform proposal would have reimbursed physicians for providing patient-requested consultations for Medicare recipients on end-of-life health planning (which is covered by many private plans), enabling <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> specify, on request, the kind of care they wished to receive. The provision was not included in ACA.|$|E

5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation which affects {{the probability of}} developing a disease in the future. For example, Lynch syndrome is a genetic disease that predisposes <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> colorectal and other cancers; early detection can lead to close monitoring that improves the patient's chances of a good outcome. Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be born with a genetic disease such as Cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing is ethically complex: patients may not want the stress of knowing their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise insurance premiums.|$|E
5|$|After the 2000 election, Fletcher {{crafted a}} {{compromise}} bill that allowed <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> sue their HMOs in federal court, capped {{pain and suffering}} awards at $500,000, and eliminated punitive damage awards. Despite an eventual compromise allowing patient lawsuits to go to state courts under certain circumstances and heavy lobbying in favor of Fletcher's bill by President George W. Bush, the House refused to pass it, favoring an alternative proposal by Georgia's Charlie Norwood that was less restrictive on patient lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the player}} has no direct {{control over the}} patients, they have some {{influence}} over whether to evict them from the hospital and in determining {{what to do with}} them when given a choice by the staff. The player can pick up any staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required. The player may force <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{facilities}} are {{equipped to handle}} TBI better than others; initial measures include transporting <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> an appropriate treatment center. Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply, maintaining adequate {{blood flow to the}} brain, and controlling raised intracranial pressure (ICP), since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed blood flow and can cause deadly brain herniation. Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures. Some data supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Each {{level has}} set {{goals in the}} fields of {{financial}} attainment, hospital reputation, patients cured, and hospital value. Holding negative funds or allowing sufficient <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> die will bring about losing requirements. When the goals have been met the player has the option to move on to a new, more elaborate hospital with tougher winning conditions and more diseases present, or stick with their current one. If enough rats have been shot, the player is taken to a special level whose goal is to shoot as many as possible.|$|E
5|$|For {{patients}} who benefit, half achieve a seizure reduction within five days (if the diet starts {{with an initial}} fast of one to two days), three-quarters achieve a reduction within two weeks, and 90% achieve a reduction within 23 days. If the diet does not begin with a fast, the time for half of the <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> achieve an improvement is longer (two weeks) but the long-term seizure reduction rates are unaffected. Parents are encouraged to persist with the diet {{for at least three}} months before any final consideration is made regarding efficacy.|$|E

5|$|Hospices: While late {{referral}} to hospice {{is a much}} more prevalent problem than early referral, some hospice providers will hesitate to admit <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> hospice (or they may de-certify them from hospice too early) due to scrutiny from Medicare for patients deemed to be on hospice too long. After a patient has been on hospice for six months, Medicare is more aggressive in auditing the hospice for inappropriate payment of services. For some hospices this is simply not worth the trouble, and patients are screened very carefully prior to admission.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell and Galle were {{terminated}} from WCMH in June 2009. A {{few days}} later, both nurses were arrested. They {{were charged with}} misuse of official information, a felony that carries the possibility of ten years imprisonment and fines up to $5,000. Roberts said that the nurses filed the complaint as a personal vendetta {{rather than as a}} good faith reporting of facts. He also noted that Mitchell and Galle sent the medical records of ten <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> the TMB without their consent; however, the reports did not include the names of patients and federal law exempts medical board reports from patient privacy laws.|$|E
5|$|On July 29, 2016, IBM and Manipal Hospitals(a leading {{hospital}} {{chain in}} India), announced launch of IBM Watson for Oncology, for cancer patients.

5|$|Preliminary care {{consists}} of gastric decontamination with either activated carbon or gastric lavage. However, {{due to the}} delay between ingestion and the first symptoms of poisoning, it is commonplace for <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> arrive for treatment long after ingestion, potentially reducing the efficacy of these interventions. Supportive measures are directed towards treating the dehydration which results from fluid loss during the gastrointestinal phase of intoxication and correction of metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, and impaired coagulation.|$|E
5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} storms to strike Vietnam since 1944, Typhoon Hester caused considerable damage in the country and disrupted the Vietnam War. Making landfall directly over the United States military installation in Chu Lai, Hester damaged or destroyed 75percent of the structures in the base. Sustained winds and gusts in the base were estimated to have reached 130km/h (80mph) and 160km/h (105mph) respectively. Four hangars collapsed in the Chu Lai airbase, with total aircraft losses amounting to 36 destroyed and 87 damaged. Losses from the destroyed helicopters exceeded $3.6million (1971USD). Dozens of barracks were damaged in Chu Lai and communications were hampered. The 91st Evacuation Hospital was mostly destroyed and was forced to transfer <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> Quy Nhơn. Nearly 50percent of the structures at the Marble Mountain Air Facility were damaged by the storm's high winds.|$|E
5|$|Schweitzer {{had prior}} {{interest}} in nursing {{and the medical}} field before Albert became involved in medicine. Therefore, Schweitzer played {{a vital role in}} his work, acting as a possible influence. In the first nine months, Schweitzer and Albert had about 2,000 <b>patients</b> <b>to</b> examine, some travelling many days and hundreds of kilometers to reach him. In her time in Africa, she worked as nurse and helped with the hospital. She played an essential part in sanitation efforts, especially by preparing medical equipment for surgery. Schweitzer was an anaesthetist for surgical operations.|$|E
