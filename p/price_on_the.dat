5|$|Saffron {{made its}} way to the New World when {{thousands}} of Alsatian, German, and Swiss Anabaptists, Dunkards, and others fled religious persecution in Europe. They settled mainly in eastern Pennsylvania, in the Susquehanna River valley. These settlers, who became known as the Pennsylvania Dutch, were by 1730 widely cultivating saffron after corms were first brought to Americain a trunk. It was owned by German adherents of a Protestant church known as the Schwenkfelder Church. Schwenkfelders, as members were known, were great lovers of saffron, and had grown it back in Germany. Pennsylvania Dutch saffron was soon being successfully marketed to Spanish colonists in the Caribbean, while healthy demand elsewhere ensured that its listed <b>price</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Philadelphia commodities exchange was set equal to that of gold.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{identify}} the factors that affect gold <b>prices</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Turkish Gold Exchange. To that end, London Bullion Market Association's gold prices, Brent oil prices, the US dollar, the American Dow Jones Industrial Index, Wholesale Price Index, Istanbul Stock Exchange 100 Index, and monthly average time deposit interest rates were selected as the factors with possible impact on gold prices; and relevant econometric models were constructed. In the model that delivered the best results among all the models estimated by using the Engle-Granger two-step estimation procedure, London Bullion Market Association's gold prices {{were found to be}} the single and most important variable that influences <b>the</b> gold <b>prices</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Istanbul Gold Exchange. Estimation of <b>the</b> gold <b>prices</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Istanbul Gold Exchange in the study was done by using ARCH models. The analysis results revealed that the EGARCH(1, 1) model is the best model. Using this model, it was concluded that gold <b>prices</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Istanbul Gold Exchange are negatively influenced by the Dow Jones Industrial Index, positively influenced by London Bullion Market Association's gold prices, also positively influenced by the Wholesale Price Index, and negatively influenced by the volatility of <b>the</b> gold <b>prices</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Istanbul Gold Exchange, which was estimated using ARCH model...|$|R

25|$|Cousin {{marriage}} normally {{results in}} a reduced bride price. Patai states that bride price to a cousin is usually about half as high as to a nonrelative. Due to the poverty of many families this outlay often requires exceptional effort, and especially because the decision traditionally {{is in the hands}} of the groom's father, these considerations may weigh heavily on the outcome. The bride's family moreover is expected to spend much of the bride <b>price</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bride herself, so there is a reduced incentive to gain a higher price by avoiding cousin marriage.|$|E

25|$|Europeans {{introduced}} saffron to the Americas when immigrant {{members of}} the Schwenkfelder Church left Europe with a trunk containing its corms. Church members had grown it widely in Europe. By 1730, the Pennsylvania Dutch cultivated saffron throughout eastern Pennsylvania. Spanish colonies in the Caribbean bought large amounts of this new American saffron, and high demand ensured that saffron's list <b>price</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Philadelphia commodities exchange was equal to gold. Trade with the Caribbean later collapsed {{in the aftermath of}} the War of 1812, when many saffron-bearing merchant vessels were destroyed. Yet the Pennsylvania Dutch continued to grow lesser amounts of saffron for local trade and use in their cakes, noodles, and chicken or trout dishes. American saffron cultivation survives into modern times, mainly in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.|$|E

25|$|Nasser's {{response}} was the nationalization of the Suez Canal. On 26 July, {{in a speech}} in Alexandria, Nasser gave a riposte to Dulles. During his speech he deliberately pronounced the name of Ferdinand de Lesseps, the builder of the canal, a code-word for Egyptian forces to seize control of the canal and implement its nationalization. He announced that the Nationalization Law had been published, that all assets of the Suez Canal Company had been frozen, and that stockholders would be paid the price of their shares according to the day's closing <b>price</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Paris Stock Exchange. That same day, Egypt closed the canal to Israeli shipping. Egypt also closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, and blockaded the Gulf of Aqaba, in contravention of the Constantinople Convention of 1888. Many argued that this was also a violation of the 1949 Armistice Agreements.|$|E
25|$|During construction, {{questions}} were publicly {{raised about the}} stability of the building's foundations in light of the water table on the site and the presence of a subterranean stream.

When the time finally came for Molloy to pay Liebe for the construction, a dispute arose as to who should be liable for the extra £17,000 incurred in remedying the structural defect. Molloy was reputed {{to be one of the}} most litigious businessmen in Perth, and refused to pay higher than the original agreed <b>price,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis that the contract required his written approval for extra work to be carried out. Liebe pursued him through the courts all the way to the High Court and Privy Council.

25|$|The uproar in {{the coin}} {{collecting}} community resulted in bad publicity {{for the city}} of Hudson. Although the specifics of how the coins came to be so quickly sold out were not immediately known, collectors intuited a trick, especially when coins proved plentiful on the market at between $5 and $7 each. Many of these sold, helping set off a commemorative coin boom that would continue later in 1935 when low-mintage varieties of the Daniel Boone Bicentennial half dollar came on the market after a similar immediate sellout. But collectors wrote angry letters to numismatic societies and periodicals, and the Hudson piece was among those described to Congress by future American Numismatic Association president L. W. Hoffecker when he testified in March 1936. By 1940, the <b>price</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> secondary market had dropped back to $5.50, but thereafter rose steadily and reached $1,700 during the commemorative coin boom of 1980.

40|$|Under {{plausible}} circumstances, a monopolist in one {{market can}} use its control of prices in that market to force competing downstream buyers to sign tying contracts that will lever its monopoly into another market. Specifically, the monopolist of the tying good can place each downstream buyer in a prisoner's dilemma by offering them more favorable <b>pricing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tying good if they sign a requirements-tying contract covering the tied good. Since a buyer benefits on receiving more favorable <b>pricing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tying {{good and the}} competitors do not, and suffers if the competitors receive more favorable <b>pricing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tying good and the buyer does not, buyers will sign the tying contract even when they would earn higher profits if they all refused to sign.
