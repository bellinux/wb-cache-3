This offered, amongst other things, the advantage of requiring only one electrical insertion point, near Visp, which would drastically reduce the costs of electrical systems {{in comparison with the}} original plans. Consideration was also given to adopting completely the SBB current system at 15,000 volts without alteration, but that idea quickly had to be abandoned. In particular, the Rhätische Bahn, which since 1913 had been operating electric traffic at 11,000 volts AC on the Engadine Line, stressed the benefits of using lower voltage than the SBB voltage. Whereas light weight air cooled transformers could be used on the Engadine Line, a heavy oil cooling system would be necessary for 15,000 volt operations, and that would greatly have increased the weight of the VZ locomotives. Additionally, the use of a single <b>phase</b> <b>current</b> system would make problem free through traffic possible in the event of electrification of the Furka Oberalp Bahn. These advantages led to the decision to use a voltage of 11,000 volts also on the Visp-Zermatt-Bahn.|$|E
2500|$|The Italian {{inventor}} Galileo Ferraris {{invented a}} polyphase AC induction motor in 1885. The {{idea was that}} two out-of-phase, but synchronized, currents {{might be used to}} produce two magnetic fields that could be combined to produce a rotating field without any need for switching or for moving parts. Other inventors were the American engineers Charles S. Bradley and Nikola Tesla, and the German technician Friedrich August Haselwander. They were able to overcome the problem of starting up the AC motor by using a rotating magnetic field produced by a poly-phase current. Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky introduced the first three-phase induction motor in 1890, a much more capable design that became the prototype used in Europe and the U.S. By 1895 GE and Westinghouse both had AC motors on the market. With single <b>phase</b> <b>current</b> either a capacitor or coil (creating inductance) can be used on part of the circuit inside the motor to create a rotating magnetic field. [...] Multi-speed AC motors that have separately wired poles have long been available, the most common being two speed. Speed of these motors is changed by switching sets of poles on or off, which was done with a special motor starter for larger motors, or a simple multiple speed switch for fractional horsepower motors.|$|E
50|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, isolated-phase bus (IPB), {{also known}} as Phase-isolated Bus (PIB) in some countries, is a method of construction for circuits carrying very large currents, typically between a generator and its step-up transformer in a steam or large hydroelectric power plant.Each <b>phase</b> <b>current</b> is carried on a separate conductor, enclosed in a separate grounded metal housing. Conductors are usually hollow aluminum tubes or aluminum bars, supported within the housing on porcelain or polymer insulators. The metal housings are electrically connected so that induced current, nearly {{of the magnitude of}} the <b>phase</b> <b>current,</b> can flow through the housing, in the opposite direction from the <b>phase</b> <b>current.</b> The magnetic field produced by this current nearly exactly cancels the magnetic field produced by the <b>phase</b> <b>current,</b> so there is almost no external magnetic field produced. This also limits the amount of force produced between conductors during a short circuit. The external housings of the conductors remain at a low potential with respect to earth ground and are usually bonded to ground.|$|E
