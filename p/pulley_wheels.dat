Phylogenic study based on the sequence have shown Renispora flavissima to be the closest related taxon. Both are treated within the Ongenaceae and share similar characteristics such as the yellow color, thin walls, narrow ascomata, and ascospores with pitted walls. Even though these two species are the most closely related to each other, the bootstrap value was low (78%), indicating that the phylogenic similarity is not particularly high. In addition to the phylogenic distance, there are notable morphological differences between the genus Chlamydosauromyces and Renispora. the hyphae of Chlamydosauromyces are subhyaline whereas those of Renispora are hyaline or translucent. Moreover, Renispora has liver-shaped ascospores, but ascospores of Chlamydosauromyces look like <b>pulley</b> <b>wheels.</b> In addition to the morphological differences between two species of fungi, the conidia of the Chrysosporium anamorph of Renispora are large with spiny tubercules and formed on stalks whereas Chlamydosauromyces produces an asexual state characterized by alternate arthroconidia.|$|E

50|$|Colonies of C. punctatus are yellow in {{the center}} and {{relatively}} flat surface at the pale peripherals with a central bump. This fungus is mesophile and grows at 30 C, but does not grow above 35 C. This fungus also shows digestion of hairs after 14 days in vitro. The keratinolytic, or keratin-digesting, capability is one of the characteristics of Onygenaceae. It is also cycloheximide resistant. C. punctatus can reproduce both in sexual and asexual forms. The teleomorph phase is gymnothecial and arises through a homothallic mating system. Ascomata of this species are round, 200-600 μm in diameter containing asci 7-9 (10) μm in length. Ascospores are yellow, 4-4.5 × 3-3.5 μm in diameter. The ascospores look like pitted smarties or <b>pulley</b> <b>wheels,</b> which is characteristics of Onygenaceae. Chlamydosauromyces punctatus has branched, narrow, smooth-walled, yellow hyphae, 1.5-2.5 μm in width with thin-walled septa. Peripheral hyphae are poorly differentiated and this is the reason that C. punctatus was once considered in the Gymnoascaceae. Ascomata lack elongate appendages. The cells initiating anastomosis are slightly swollen.|$|E

In this thesis, there will be information about the problem with landmines today and how a landmine work, along with the development process for the product, including concept evaluation, calculations and simulations. The basic idea of the concept is that a load is to be dropped at the landmines location. The load will create a ground pressure that will trigger any pressure sensitive landmines. The load is a 25 kg heavy bag of sand and it will be dropped from a height of 1 meter. A winch lifts the load up and keeps it in the air. A clutch disconnects the drum {{from the rest of the}} winch system and the load drops to the ground. A scaffold is placed on the robot, with a <b>pulley</b> <b>wheel</b> at the top. The scaffold and the <b>pulley</b> <b>wheel</b> are designed and placed so that the <b>pulley</b> <b>wheel</b> is directly above the landmines, which are located in the middle and at the rear of the robot. A steel wire connects the load and the winch via the <b>pulley</b> <b>wheel.</b> The clutch is custom designed from scratch to fit the winch system. A linear actuator connects and disconnects the clutch. The winch is driven by a brushless direct current motor, along with a gearbox. Simulations done by FFI gives reason for optimism for the continuation of the project. A prototype is yet to be completed...|$|R
