25|$|A {{package of}} 5 gum {{contains}} 15 sticks of gum in the United States and Canada, and 12 in Europe and Australia. It is a slim packet with three rows of five in North America, or three rows of four in other countries. Ingredients, nutrition facts, and {{description of the}} flavor aren't {{on the outside of}} the box (except for the European versions), instead they are printed on the outer <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap,</b> to keep the box itself simple.

The wrappers all match the color of the gum inside (except for the American Prism flavor, which has a lime green wrapper with red-orange gum). The original 5 gum variety pack contained three packs of Rain, Cobalt, Lush and Elixir. A new variety pack was introduced in fall 2009 containing the flavors Rain, Cobalt, Solstice and Zing, and another with three packs of Cobalt, Rain, Solstice, and Elixir. The pack has a Tidy Man logo, which is a human figure in the shape of the 5 logo.|$|E

Rihanna is then shown seated and surrounded by CCTV surveillance cameras; her chair begins to rotate, and she stands and begins to whip reporters, who are taped {{to the wall of}} the room. She then rolls on the floor, her hands and feet bound with rope. As the bridge of the song approaches, Rihanna wears a white latex bikini and rabbit ears, while images of headlines are projected against her body and the wall behind her. After the chorus, she appears in a newsroom. Reporters take photographs of her while she sprawls across a desk wearing a pink latex dress.

Sharon Clott of MTV also noted the similarity between Gaga's dress and Ryden's painting. Ryden was reportedly upset that Gaga did not acknowledge that she took inspiration from his work. Some in the art and fashion press remarked on the dress' similarity to , a meat dress made by Canadian sculptor Jana Sterbak in 1987 exhibited to considerable controversy at the National Gallery of Canada in 1991. Karen Rosenberg from The New York Times compared the dress to a series of photographs of Francis Bacon posing with sides of beef attached to his torso like wings in 1952, while The Daily Telegraph compared the dress to the original cover of The Beatles' 1966 album Yesterday and Today, and noted its similarity to the cover of the November 1983 The Undertones album All Wrapped Up, which showed a female model wearing a dress and gloves made of cuts of meat (mostly bacon) held in place with <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> and a sausage necklace. Architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro had also designed a meat dress in 2006. An earlier example of a garment made from meat stitched together {{in the same way as}} the Lady Gaga meat dress was worn at the Slade School of Art postgraduate degree exhibition opening in London, England in July 1979, when performance artist Robert Connolly wore a two-piece suit made of slices of salami.|$|E
