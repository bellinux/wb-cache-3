50|$|The <b>PIO</b> <b>interface</b> is {{grouped into}} {{different}} modes {{that correspond to}} different transfer rates. The electrical signaling among the different modes is similar — only the cycle time between transactions is reduced {{in order to achieve}} a higher transfer rate. All ATA devices support the slowest mode — Mode 0. By accessing the information registers (using Mode 0) on an ATA drive, the CPU is able to determine the maximum transfer rate for the device and configure the ATA controller for optimal performance.|$|E
40|$|PDS/PIO is a lightweight, {{parallel}} interface designed to support efficient transfers of massive, grid-based, simulation data among memory, disk, and tape subsystems. The higher-level PDS (Parallel Data Set) interface manages data with tensor and unstructured grid abstractions, while the lower-level <b>PIO</b> (Parallel Input/Output) <b>interface</b> accesses data arrays with arbitrary permutation, and provides communication and collective 1 / 0 operations. Higher-level data abstraction for finite element applications {{is provided by}} PXI (Parallel Exodus Interface), which supports, in parallel, functionality of Exodus 11, a finite element data model developed at Sandia National Laboratories. The entire interface is implemented in C with Fortran-callable PDS and PXI wrappers...|$|R
