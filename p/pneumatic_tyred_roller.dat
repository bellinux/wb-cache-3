50|$|On some machines, {{the drums}} may {{be filled with}} water on site to achieve the desired weight. When empty, the lighter machine is easier and cheaper to {{transport}} between work sites. On <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyre</b> <b>rollers</b> the body may be ballasted with water or sand, or for extra compaction wet sand is used. Modern <b>tyre</b> <b>rollers</b> may be filled with steel ballast, which gives a more even balance for better compaction.|$|R
50|$|Road rollers use {{the weight}} of the vehicle to {{compress}} the surface being rolled (static) or use mechanical advantage (vibrating). Initial compaction of the substrate on a road project is done using a padfoot drum roller, which achieves higher compaction density due to the pads having less surface area. On large freeways a four wheel compactor with padfoot drum and a blade, such as a Caterpillar 815/825 series machine, would be used due to its high weight, speed and the powerful pushing force to spread bulk material. On regional roads a smaller single padfoot drum machine may be used. The next machine is usually a single smooth drum compactor that compacts the high spots down until the soil is smooth, and this is usually done in combination with a motor grader to get a level surface. Sometimes at this stage a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyre</b> <b>roller</b> would be used. These rollers feature two rows (front and back) of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyres</b> that overlap, and the flexibility of the tyres provides a kneading action that seals the surface and with some vertical movement of the wheels, enables the roller to operate effectively on uneven ground. Once the soil base is flat the pad drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface. The next course (road base) would be compacted using a smooth single drum, smooth tandem <b>roller</b> or <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyre</b> <b>roller</b> in combination with a grader, and a water truck to achieve the desired flat surface with the right moisture content for optimum compaction. Once the road base is compacted, the smooth single drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface (There is however an exception, if the single drum has special flat-wide-base tyres on the machine). The final wear course of asphalt concrete (a.k.a. asphalt or blacktop in North America, or macadam in England) is laid using a paver and compacted using a tandem smooth drum roller, a three-point <b>roller</b> or a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyre</b> <b>roller.</b> Three point rollers on asphalt were very common once and are still used, but tandem vibrating rollers are the usual choice now, with the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyre</b> <b>roller's</b> kneading action being the last roller to seal off the surface.|$|R
40|$|Proof rolling of {{granular}} layers in aircraft pavements is {{an integral}} part of the pavement thickness design methods used in Australia. The Department of Defence has a fleet of special purpose <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyred</b> <b>rollers</b> with the capability to operate at up to 50 t on four wheels with tyre pressures of 1, 400 kPa. In 2004 the tyre manufacturers reduced the maximum allowable tyre pressures to 1, 000 kPa, creating a gap between aircraft load and the capacity of the proof rollers. To allow flexible aircraft pavements to continue to be constructed, one roller was upgraded to include solid urethane tyres with an effective contract pressure of 1, 700 kPa and higher. Whilst this roller has undergone a preliminary trial that was found to be successful, further trials are required prior to upgrading the remaining roller fleet...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} compactors and lift thickness on {{hot mix asphalt}} (HMA) have been persistently discussed among asphalt experts. In many cases, pavements paved with the high-in-place air voids permit water to penetrate the permeable pavement causing an increased tendency for pavement deformation. The thin lifts have had problems achieving high density, which leads to high-in-place air voids. The present paper is aimed at evaluating the effects of different compactors, an 11 -ton steel drum compactor and a 15 -ton <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tyre</b> <b>roller,</b> on the HMA mat with different ratios of thickness to nominal maximum aggregate size (t/NMAS). In order to achieve this aim, seven field sections with a total 36 locations with distinct HMA mixes, thicknesses and rolling patterns were built. Each of the sections was approximately 40 m long and 3. 5 m wide. The section was constructed with t/NMAS ratio varying from 2. 0 at the beginning to 5. 0 {{at the end of}} the section. The air temperature during construction varied from 26 °C to 35 °C. More so, for comparison purposes, the simulated HMA mat temperatures using MultiCool 3. 0 software and their respective measured temperature were also taken. The results indicate that the optimum number of passes to achieve maximum density is four passes. This could be achieved by merely using the steel roller with vibratory mode. However, the introduction of rubber <b>tyre</b> <b>roller</b> during the intermediate rolling initially reduced the density by one to two percent but started to increase after several passes...|$|R
