50|$|The most {{prolific}} author on dedicated portfolio theory, Martin L. Leibowitz, {{was the first}} to refer to dedicated portfolios as “cash matching” portfolios. He demonstrated how they are the simplest case of the technique known as bond <b>portfolio</b> <b>immunization.</b> In his sketch of its history, he traces the origin of immunization to Frederick R. Macaulay who first suggested the notion of “duration” for fixed income securities in 1938. Duration represents the average life of the coupon payments and redemption of a bond and links changes in interest rates to the volatility of a bond’s value. One year later, J.R. Hicks independently developed a similar formulation referred to as the “average period.” In 1942, T.C. Koopmans pointed out in a report that, by matching the duration of the bonds held in a portfolio to the duration of liabilities those bonds would fund, the effects of interest rate changes could be mitigated or nullified completely, i.e. immunized. In 1945, Paul Samuelson formulated essentially the same concept, calling it the “weighted-average time period.” None of these earliest researchers cited each other’s work, suggesting each developed the concept independently. The work culminated in a 1952 paper by a British actuary, F. M. Redington.|$|E

50|$|In finance, {{interest}} rate immunization, as developed by Frank Redington {{is a strategy}} that ensures that a change in {{interest rate}}s will not affect {{the value of a}} <b>portfolio.</b> Similarly, <b>immunization</b> can be used to ensure that the value of a pension fund's or a firm's assets will increase or decrease in exactly the opposite amount of their liabilities, thus leaving the value of the pension fund's surplus or firm's equity unchanged, regardless of changes in the interest rate.|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} {{functionally}} generated portfolios (FGPs) is {{an aspect of}} the continuous-time, continuous-path Stochastic Portfolio Theory of Robert Fernholz. FGPs have been formulated to yield a master equation - a description of their return relative to a passive (buy-and-hold) benchmark portfolio serving as the numéraire. This description has proven to be analytically very useful, as it is both pathwise and free of stochastic integrals. Here we generalize the class of FGPs in several ways: (1) the numéraire may be any strictly positive wealth process, not necessarily the market portfolio or even a passive portfolio; (2) generating functions may be stochastically dynamic, adjusting to changing market conditions through an auxiliary continuous-path stochastic argument of finite variation. These generalizations do not forfeit the important tractability properties of the associated master equation. We show how these generalizations can be usefully applied to scenario analysis, statistical arbitrage, <b>portfolio</b> risk <b>immunization,</b> and the theory of mirror portfolios.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{interactive}} effect of default and {{interest rate risk}} on duration of defaultable bonds. We show that duration for defaultable bonds can be longer or shorter than default-free bonds depending on the relation between default intensity and interest rates. Empirical evidence indicates that in most cases duration for defaultable bonds is much shorter than for their default-free counterparts because of the negative relation between default risk and interest rates.

So many researchers have examined this problem or by establishing some results for bond <b>portfolio</b> <b>immunization</b> or lower limits for portfolio net value variation, when the shock belongs to a certain class of functions. In general, these inequalities hold for portfolios in balance and duration-matching, and contain terms dependent on certain types of temporal dispersion.

5000|$|This body of {{work was}} largely ignored until 1971, when Center for Research in Security Prices (Lawrence Fisher and Roman Weil) re-introduced {{immunization}} to the academic community in a journal article that followed a 1969 report written for the Center for Research in Securities Prices. Shortly thereafter, in 1972, I.T. Vanderhoof presented the concept to the American actuarial community. Academic papers on immunization, duration, and dedication {{began to appear in}} increasing numbers, as interest rates began to rise. As rates rose further and further above their long term averages, the financial investment industry began to pay attention, and their inquiries increasingly attracted the attention of academic researchers. Realizing that the high rates would allow them to lock in unprecedented rates of return, defined-benefit pension fund managers embraced the concepts. Goldman Sachs and other high level firms began to produce software to help bond portfolio managers apply the theory to their institutional sized portfolios. Most of the examples used in the literature typically utilized portfolios consisting of several hundred million dollars. In 1981, Leibowitz and Weinberger published a report on “contingent immunization” discussing the blending of active management of bond <b>portfolios</b> with <b>immunization</b> to provide a floor on returns. Leibowitz [...] also published a paper in two parts defining dedicated portfolios in 1986. One of the side benefits of the theoretical work and practical interest was the development of new fixed income instruments, such as zero-coupon bonds. The most recent book on the topic, based on a research project at the University of San Francisco in the late 1990s, is titled Asset Dedication by Huxley and Burns. It was published in 2005, describing the strategy and how the advances in desktop computers have reduced the cost of constructing dedicated portfolios to levels where individual investors could use the concept for personal investing, such as the example below shows for a retirement portfolio.|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} MITACS project {{in collaboration with}} Addenda Capital, two basic liability matching strategies have been investigated: cash flow matching and moment matching. These strategies performed well under {{a wide variety of}} tests including historical backtesting. A potential shortcoming for both of these methods is that the optimization process is done only once {{at the beginning of the}} investment horizon and uses deterministic moment matching constraints to immunize the portfolio against interest rate movements. Though the portfolio subsequently need to be frquently rebalanced, this static optimization does not take into account the relatively high rebalancing costs it involves. The main objective of this present project is to further enhance the moment matching method by implementing and testing a stochastic dynamic optimization and by comparing its efficiency with the static one. Our dynamic optimization problem is to minimize the portfolio cost and its expected rebalancing costs one month ahead over a set of interest rate scenarios by the use of stochastic moment matching constraints. Our backtesting results show some improvements with the 6 moments matching strategy as the dynamic optimization slightly shrinks the difference in asset-liability gap between scenarios compared with the static optimization. However, after analyzing the realized periodic rebalancing costs each month (a constant bid-ask spread has been assigned to each asset's position change in the optimal <b>portfolio),</b> the <b>immunization</b> improvements are mitigated by substantialy higher costs. We also noticed, in the case of the duration/convexity matching strategy, that the dynamic optimization is not that much more efficient than the static method. Thus, these results confirm that the 6 moments matching technique is still more efficient with both the static and stochastic dynamic optimization. Our extensive dynamic analysis of transaction costs through backtesting showed that from an efficiency to cost ratio and an efficiency to simplicity ratio, the static 6 moments matching method seems so far to be a more practical solution for liability matching...|$|R
40|$|This paper uncovers an {{implicit}} assumption, and its implications, {{made in the}} process of maximizing yield (or minimizing costs) subject to the duration constraints. Using linear programming results, it is shown that this technique is sensible only if the yield of a bond is a linear function of its duration measures. Utilizing this result the paper analyzes the relative importance of the duration constraints. Former studies have hinted that the first order duration may be the most important. It is shown here {{there is no reason to}} satisfy the first duration constraint with priority over satisfaction of a higher order duration constraint.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a framework for}} managing portfolios of fixed income instruments based on traditional principles from the equities market, i. e., based on diversification. It shows, through {{an analysis of the}} high-yield bond market over the period 1987 to 1991, that fixed-income prices could be highly correlated. These correlations can be quantified and integrated, in a systematic way, in an asset/liability management framework. For vanishing fixed income securities, however, we cannot resort to statistical analysis of historical data in order to quantify correlations. The paper {{develops a}} forward-looking simulation procedure for capturing correlations. Applications are illustrated for examples from high-yield bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The superiority of the proposed approach over the traditional <b>portfolio</b> <b>immunization</b> techniques is demonstrated in the context of funding an insurance liability stream with mortgage instruments. stochastic optimization, finance, portfolio optimization...|$|E
40|$|In Practical Financial Optimization: A Library of GAMS Models, {{the authors}} provide a diverse set of models for {{portfolio}} optimization, {{based on the}} General Algebraic Modelling System. 'GAMS' consists of a language which allows a high-level, algebraic representation of mathematical models {{and a set of}} solvers [...] - numerical algorithms [...] - to solve them. The system was developed in response to the need for powerful and flexible front-end tools to manage large, real-life models. The work begins with an overview {{of the structure of the}} GAMS language, and discusses issues relating to the management of data in GAMS models. The authors provide models for mean-variance portfolio optimization which address the question of trading off the portfolio expected return against its risk. Fixed income portfolio optimization models perform standard calculations and allow the user to bootstrap a yield curve from bond prices. Dedication models allow for standard portfolio dedication with borrowing and re-investment decisions, and are extended to deal with maximisation of horizon return and to incorporate various practical considerations on the <b>portfolio</b> tradeability. <b>Immunization</b> models provide for the factor <b>immunization</b> of <b>portfolios</b> of treasury and corporate bonds. The scenario-based portfolio optimization problem is addressed with mean absolute deviation models, tracking models, regret models, conditional VaR models, expected utility maximization models and put/call efficient frontier models. The authors employ stochastic programming for dynamic portfolio optimization, developing stochastic dedication models as stochastic extensions of the fixed income models discussed in chapter 4. Two-stage and multi-stage stochastic programs extend the scenario models analysed in Chapter 5 to allow dynamic rebalancing of portfolios as time evolves and new information becomes known. Models for structuring index funds and hedging interest rate risk on international portfolios are also provided. The final chapter provides a set of 'case studies': models for large-scale applications of portfolio optimization, which can be used as the basis for the development of business support systems to suit any special requirements, including models for the management of participating insurance policies and personal asset allocation.

40|$|Are the {{managers}} of financial institutions ready for the small but increasingly significant risk of inflation in the near future, due to the unprecedented fiscal and monetary responses of the U. S. government to prevent an economic collapse? This paper addresses this important issue by reviewing important findings {{in the area of}} interest rate risk management. We discuss five classes of models in the fixed income literature that deal with hedging the risk of large, non-parallel yield curve shifts. These models are given as M-Absolute/M-Square models, duration vector models, key rate duration models, principal component duration models, and extensions of these models for fixed income derivatives, for valuing and hedging bonds, loans, demand deposits, and other fixed income instruments. These models can be used for designing various hedging strategies such as <b>portfolio</b> <b>immunization,</b> bond index replication, duration gap management, and contingent immunization, to protect against changes in the height, slope, and curvature of the yield curve. We argue that the current regulatory models proposed by the U. S.
