40|$|The {{concept of}} underactuation is {{increasingly}} applied to hand prostheses because it minimizes {{the number of}} actuators while the fingers are adaptive to the grasped objects. However, current underactuated grasp mechanisms suffer from an intrinsic stability problem which disables them to obtain a pinch grasp, hence they fail to grasp small objects. In an attempt {{to solve this problem}} <b>joint</b> <b>locks</b> are applied to an underactuated pulley-tendon driven hand. <b>Joint</b> <b>locks</b> might also {{have an effect on the}} power grasp strength. Therefore the effect of <b>joint</b> <b>locks</b> on the pinch grasp performance and power grasp strength of underactuated hand prostheses is investigated. This effect is quantified by two grasp performance metrics: the ability to pinch and the ability to hold. To find the optimal <b>joint</b> <b>lock</b> configurations for pinch grasp performance and power grasp strength, the effect of different <b>joint</b> <b>lock</b> configurations on both performance metrics is calculated using a static grasp model. The results of this model are validated by measurements on a prototype. Both the model and the measurements showed that <b>joint</b> <b>locks</b> do not have a significant effect on the pinch grasp performance when only the range of object sizes for which a pinch grasp equilibrium exists is considered. However, the measurements showed that a pinch grasp is more easily established with <b>joint</b> <b>locks.</b> Additionally, both the model and the measurements showed a significant increase in the power grasp strength.

30|$|This paper {{conducts a}} {{research}} on fault tolerance trajectory {{planning for a}} 6 -DOF space manipulator under a single joint failure, and the workspace of the manipulator for pre- or post-failure is analyzed based on the actual situation of joint failure. The analytical inverse kinematics equation of the 5 -DOF formed from the 6 -DOF manipulator with <b>locking</b> single <b>joint</b> is derived to ensure the completion of part tasks in the workspace. In order to further represent {{the ability of the}} manipulator under a single joint failure, the concept of fault-tolerant angle is introduced. Then the relationship between the fault tolerance angle and the <b>locked</b> <b>joint</b> is established. Based on it, the best choice of desired angle of each joint which is most suitable for specific task can be determined. This paper provided an effective way to maximize the ability of a space manipulator under a single joint failure.|$|R
