40|$|Fault arcs in {{electrical}} installations occur extremely seldom. However, {{they can not}} be avoided totally. Insulation failure, flashover, malfunction or maloperation by service personnel can lead to powerful fault arcs. As a result switchgear installations and even substation buildings may be endangered by thermal and mechanical stress. Metal enclosed switchgears can withstand some hundred mbar overpressure, substation buildings e. g. constructed of bricks may be damaged by overpressures exceeding 3 mbar. The goal of this work is the investigation of possibilities to reduce overpressure due to internal arcs especially in switchgear rooms or substation buildings. The following measures are analysed:- <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> openings,- intermediate volumes and relief ducts,- fault arc energy absorbers. Encapsulated (gas insulated) switchgears are provided with overpressure relief devices which lead to the switchgear room. After fault arc ignition pressure rises in the compartment where the arc burns (arc room), the relief devices open and the overpressure in the switchgear room rises. The level of overpressure depends significantly on fault arc duration and power, which can be about some 10 MW in distribution systems. The overpressure reduction in the switchgear room can be achieved e. g. by sufficiently dimensioned <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> openings. Another possibility is the use of intermediate rooms as buffer volumes or <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>ducts,</b> which can be installed on switchgears draining hot gases. Fault arc energy absorbers are cooling grids, which withdraw energy from hot gases generated by the fault arc with the result of overpressure reduction. The overpressure development is analysed by using two available program packages. The first one leads to pressure results, which are averaged values in the volume under consideration. The second one is a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tool with three dimensional results. To quantify the effect of fault arc energy absorbers, experiments with a high-current test set-up are performed. The results of these investigations shall contribute to a safe design of measures for overpressure reduction in the case of fault arcs {{in electrical}} installations...|$|R

40|$|From {{a safety}} standpoint, {{regardless}} of plant or facility type, {{the most important}} pieces of equipment are the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> devices.

40|$|Abstract- <b>Pressure</b> <b>relief</b> valve {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} devices used on the security of pipelines, since it is responsible to guarantee the integrity of the installations. Generally, the response and behavior of a relief valve during its transient is unknown by users, who employ simplified and static analysis to design the pipeline, further, the information provided by manufactures is limited. The flow-pressure, displacement-time and pressure –time relationships are an important external characteristic of the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> valve and the hydraulic circuit. So, many engineers have been put an effort on this topic for its significant impact on the overall hydraulic system. Most of them are focused on the influences of the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> valves, their selections and applications. It is very important to select, size, locate properly and maintain the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> systems to prevent or minimize the losses from major incidents. Detail of selection and sizing of <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> valve is shown the following sections of this study.

40|$|The use of <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts {{has often}} been {{proposed}} {{as a means of}} reducing pressure fluctuations and of improving passenger comfort on board high-speed trains in tunnels. The recently opened rail-link between Mattstetten-Rothrist in Switzerland {{is one of the first}} rail projects where such shafts became an integral part of the project right from the design stage. The effectiveness of <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts has been proven during the commissioning phase of this 45 km long new rail-link. Several aerodynamic measurements were conducted in different tunnels with and without <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts and with different train types. One example is the double-track Emmequerung tunnel with a free cross-sectional area of Atunnel = 76 m 2 with two <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts (Ashaft = 12. 25 m 2). The same tunnel without any <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts would have required a larger free cross-sectional area of Atunnel = 105 m 2 in order to satisfy the project specific comfort criteria for various train types (∆ptrain < 1. 5 kPa within 4 s). In general, smaller tunnel cross-sections lead to reduced construction costs. Furthermore <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts can be combined with additional functions (egress path, smoke extraction, climate improvement, etc.). These advantages must be balanced with possible disadvantages (noise emissions, increased local air flows in the tunnel, etc.) and the limitations (ground overburden). The experience gained from the new Swiss rail-link shows that under certain conditions <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts are effective and reasonable. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Offloading plantar {{pressure}} {{is a key}} strategy for the prevention or healing of neuropathic plantar ulcers in diabetes. Non-removable walking casts, such as total contact casts, are currently considered the gold-standard for offloading this type of wound. However, alternative methods for offloading that are more cost effective {{and easier to use}} are continually being sought. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the capacity of the DH <b>Pressure</b> <b>Relief</b> Shoe™ to offload high pressure areas under the neuropathic foot in diabetes. Methods A within-subjects, repeated measures design was used. Sixteen participants with diabetic peripheral neuropathy were recruited and three footwear conditions were evaluated in a randomised order: a canvas shoe (the control), the participants’ own standard shoe, and the DH <b>Pressure</b> <b>Relief</b> Shoe™. The primary outcome was peak plantar pressure, measured using the pedar-X® mobile in-shoe system between the three conditions. Results Data analysis was conducted on 14 out of the 16 participants because two participants could not complete data collection. The mean peak pressure values in kPa (±SD) for each condition were: control shoe 315. 9 (± 140. 7), participants’ standard shoe 273. 0 (± 127. 1) and DH <b>Pressure</b> <b>Relief</b> Shoe™ 155. 4 (± 89. 9). There was a statistically significant difference in peak plantar pressure between the DH <b>Pressure</b> <b>Relief</b> Shoe™ compared to both the control shoe (p [*]=[*] 0. 002) and participants’ standard shoe (p [*]=[*] 0. 001). The DH <b>Pressure</b> <b>Relief</b> Shoe™ decreased plantar pressures by 51 % compared to the control shoe and by 43 % compared to participants’ standard shoe. Importantly, for a couple of study participants, the DH <b>Pressure</b> <b>Relief</b> Shoe™ appeared unsuitable for day-to-day wearing. Conclusions The DH <b>Pressure</b> <b>Relief</b> Shoe™ reduced plantar pressures more than the other two shoe conditions. The DH <b>Pressure</b> <b>Relief</b> Shoe™ may be a useful alternative to current offloading modalities used in clinical management of diabetic foot ulceration. However, clinical trials are needed to test their effectiveness for ulcer healing and to ensure they are useable and safe for patients in everyday activities. </p...|$|R
