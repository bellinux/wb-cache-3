5000|$|To Lippmann, the {{journalist}} fulfilled {{the role of}} mediator, or translator, between {{the general public and}} policy-making elites. Lippmann reasoned that the public could not assess modern society's growingly complex flurry of facts; therefore, it needed an intermediary to filter its news. Journalists served as this intermediary, recording the information exchanged among elites, distilling it, and passing it on for public consumption. The public would affect the decisions of the elite with its vote; in the meantime, the elite would keep the business of power running. Effectively, Lippmann's philosophy had the public {{at the bottom of the}} <b>power</b> <b>chain,</b> inheriting its information from the elite.Lippmann's elitism had consequences that he came to deplore. An apostle of historicism and scientism, Lippmann did not merely hold that democratic government was a problematic exercise, but regarded all political communities, of whatever stripe, as needing guidance from a transcendent partisanship for accurate information and dispassionate judgment. In [...] "Liberty and the News" [...] (1919) and [...] "Public Opinion" [...] (1921) Lippmann expressed the hope that liberty could be redefined to take account of the scientific and historical perspective and that public opinion could be managed by a system of intelligence in and out of government. Thus the liberty of {{the journalist}} was to be dedicated to gathering verifiable facts while commentators like himself would place the news in the broader perspective. Lippmann deplored the influence of powerful newspaper publishers and preferred the judgments of the [...] "patient and fearless men of science". In so doing, he denigrated not only the opinion of the majority but also the opinion of those who had influence or power as well. In a republican form of government, the representatives are chosen by the people and share with them adherence to the fundamental principles and political institutions of the polity. Lippmann's quarrel was with those very principles and institutions, for they are the product of the pre-scientific and pre-historical viewpoint and what for him was a groundless natural-rights political philosophy.|$|E

Elastomeric chains are extensively used as tooth moving mechanism in orthodontics.

Five variables (Dynamic force, loss Stiffness, Storage Stiffness, Tan Delta and Damping) were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance and Post-Hoc test was done to evaluate the difference between the means at different frequencies.
