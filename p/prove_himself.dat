5|$|When Davis {{and other}} youngsters signed new deals in 2011, McCarthy had said they stood less chance of first-team {{football}} in the Premier League {{than when the}} team were playing in the Championship.

5|$|Fitzgerald's {{goal was}} to produce a {{literary}} work which would truly <b>prove</b> <b>himself</b> as a writer, and Gatsby {{did not have the}} commercial success of his two previous novels, This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and Damned. Although the novel went through two initial printings, some of these copies remained unsold years later. Fitzgerald himself blamed poor sales on the fact that women tended to be the main audience for novels during this time, and Gatsby did not contain an admirable female character. According to his own ledger, now made available online by University of South Carolina's Thomas Cooper library, he earned only $2,000 from the book. Although 1926 brought Owen Davis's stage adaption and the Paramount-issued silent film version, both of which brought in money for the author, Fitzgerald still felt the novel fell short of the recognition he hoped for and, most importantly, would not propel him to becoming a serious novelist in the public eye. For several years afterward, the general public believed The Great Gatsby to be nothing more than a nostalgic period piece.|$|E
5|$|Following Lego Racers success, news {{arose in}} April 2001 that Pocket Studios {{was working on}} a sequel to the Game Boy Advance version of Lego Racers, titled Lego Racers 2, which was then shown at E3 2001 in May that year. The eponymous Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 2 {{counterpart}} to Lego Racers 2, developed by Attention to Detail, was announced in August 2001, and released in September 2001.

Lego Racers 2 was received less favorably than Lego Racers, and too far incorporated elements from both, Lego Racers and Rollcage, another game developed by Attention to Detail.|$|E
