40|$|There {{are several}} viable crops for small farms. In {{order to provide}} more {{familiarity}} on the occurrence of canola cultivation {{in the state of}} Paraná, the present study aimed to identify the areas sown (hectares) and canola <b>production</b> (<b>tonnes)</b> during the growing of 2005 to 2009. The methodology involved literature review and analysis of spatial data from the Department of Supply of Paraná (PR-SEAB). We used the software ArcGis 9. 3 for elaboration of thematic maps of variables and free software GeoDa 0. 9. 5 -i. The identification of spatial dependence by way of univariate spatial autocorrelation globally by Moran's I statistic and local level by Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA). Demonstrated the existence of spatial correlation in the data area sown (ha) and <b>production</b> (<b>tonnes)</b> in those with canola crops. The results also indicate that the state of Paraná has huge potential for expansion of cultivation, besides being an interesting option to compose systems of crop rotation and soil cover. The application of spatial statistical area contributed to the recognition of the evolution of the canola crop in the state of Paraná, with the spatialization of production and sown area in the municipalities. It is evident most municipality with no significant pattern, demonstrating the potential for expansion of the area to be sown in the state. In standard High-High, it was noted that municipality are grouped mainly in the western and south-central state of Paraná. Pages: 756 - 76...|$|R
