5|$|Broasting uses a <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> to {{accelerate}} the process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases the pressure in the cooker, lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in a <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker.</b> Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. The lid {{is placed on the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker,</b> and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure.|$|E

5|$|As the geyser fills, {{the water}} {{at the top of}} the column cools off, but because of the narrowness of the channel, {{convective}} cooling of the water in the reservoir is impossible.

5|$|When being cooked, {{fried chicken}} is often divided into smaller pieces. The chicken is then {{generally}} {{covered in a}} batter, often consisting of ingredients such as eggs or milk, and a thickener such as flour. This is {{used to create a}} crust on the exterior of the meat. In addition, seasoning is often added at this stage. Once the chicken is ready to be cooked, it is placed in a deep fryer, frying pan or <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> (depending on the method used) and fried in lard or a type of oil.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>cookers</b> are {{typically}} made of aluminum (aluminium) or stainless steel. Aluminum <b>pressure</b> <b>cookers</b> may be stamped, polished, or anodized, but all are unsuitable for the dishwasher.

25|$|The Boston Marathon Bombing was {{a bombing}} incident, {{followed}} by subsequent related shootings, that occurred when two <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> bombs exploded during the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013. The bombs exploded about 12 seconds and 210 yards (190 m) apart at 2:49 pm EDT, near the marathon's finish line on Boylston Street. They killed 3 people and injured an estimated 264 others.|$|E
25|$|That day, Dzhokhar was {{captured}} on CCTV near {{the finish line}} pushing his way through spectators towards the front carrying a duffel bag which contained one of two <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> bombs that would detonate. Tsarnaev appeared to place the bag down without causing any suspicion amongst spectators and then appeared to watch some marathon runners cross the finish line before hurrying away moments before the bomb exploded, causing mass panic among spectators and marathon runners. Shortly after the second bomb exploded, CCTV captured both Tsarnaev brothers running among the crowd away from the scene.|$|E
25|$|The {{heat that}} drives {{geothermal}} {{activity in the}} Yellowstone area comes from brine (salty water) that is 1.5 to 3 miles (2.4 to 4.8km) below the surface. This is actually below the solid volcanic rock and sediment that extends {{to a depth of}} 3,000 to 6,000 feet (900 to 1,800 m) and is inside the hot but mostly solid part of the pluton that contains Yellowstone’s magma chamber. At that depth the brine is superheated to temperatures that exceed 400°F or 205°C but is able to remain a liquid because it is under great pressure (like a huge <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker).</b>|$|E

He claimed to have {{engineered}} the <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> bombs with his associates in a flat in central Mumbai. If verified, these allegations could invalidate the previous claims by the ATS that the ISI or the SIMI were involved. Sadiq states in his confession, ‘‘All five of us arranged local first class train passes beforehand. We also had the local train time table with us {{so that we could}} choose a train as per our convenience. We purchased bags and pressure cookers in Bombay.’’ He also claimed to have misled investigators by blaming the attacks on the Al-Qaeda.|$|E
25|$|The {{oil sands}} of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) were {{formed as a}} result of the {{formation}} of the Canadian Rocky Mountains by the Pacific Plate overthrusting over the North American Plate as it pushed in from the west, carrying the formerly large island chains which now compose most of British Columbia. The collision compressed the Alberta plains and raised the Rockies over the plains, forming the Canadian Rockies. This mountain building process buried the sedimentary rock layers which underlie most of Alberta very deep, creating high subsurface temperatures, and producing a giant <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> that converted the kerogen in the deeply buried organic-rich shales to light oil and natural gas. These source rocks were similar to the American so-called oil shales, except the latter have never been buried deep enough to convert the kerogen in them into liquid oil.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to braise meats and vegetables in a pot {{on top of a}} grill. A gas or electric charbroil grill are the best choices for barbecue-braising, combining dry heat charbroil-grilling directly on a ribbed surface and braising in a broth-filled pot for moist heat. The pot is placed on top of the grill, covered, and allowed to simmer for a few hours. There are two advantages to barbecue-braising; it allows browning of the meat directly on the grill before the braising. It also allows for glazing of meat with sauce and finishing it directly over the fire after the braising. This effectively cooks the meat three times, which results in a soft, textured product that falls off the bone. The time needed for braising varies depending on whether a slow cooker or <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> is used; it is generally slower than regular grilling or baking, but quicker than pit-smoking.|$|E

25|$|In the Changing World Technologies (CWT) process, the {{feedstock}} {{material is}} first ground into small chunks, and mixed with water {{if it is}} especially dry. It is then fed into a pressure vessel reaction chamber where it is heated at constant volume to around 250 °C. Similar to a <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> (except at much higher pressure), steam naturally raises the pressure to 600 psi (4 MPa) (near the point of saturated water). These conditions are held for approximately 15 minutes to fully heat the mixture, after which the pressure is rapidly released to boil off most of the water (see: Flash evaporation). The result {{is a mix of}} crude hydrocarbons and solid minerals. The minerals are removed, and the hydrocarbons are sent to a second-stage reactor where they are heated to 500°C, further breaking down the longer hydrocarbon chains. The hydrocarbons are then sorted by fractional distillation, in a process similar to conventional oil refining.|$|E

The ensuing manhunt ended on April 19 when thousands of law enforcement officers searched a 20-block area of nearby Watertown. Dzhokhar later {{said that he was}} motivated by extremist Islamic beliefs and learned to build explosive devices from Inspire, the online magazine of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.|$|E
500|$|Like other boletes, porcini can be dried {{by being}} strung {{separately}} on twine and hung {{close to the}} ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placing them in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer {{on top of a}} boiler or hot water tank. Another method is drying in an oven at [...] for two to three hours, then increasing the temperature to [...] until crisp or brittle. Once dry, they are kept in an airtight jar. Importantly for commercial production, porcini retain their flavour after industrial preparation in a <b>pressure</b> <b>cooker</b> or after canning or bottling, and are thus useful for manufacturers of soups or stews. The addition of a few pieces of dried porcino can significantly add to flavour, and they are a major ingredient of the pasta sauce known as carrettiere (carter's sauce). The drying process is known to induce the formation of various volatile substances that contribute to the mushroom's aroma. Chemical analysis has shown that the odour of the dried mushroom is a complex mixture of 53 volatile compounds.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>cookers</b> {{have been}} used {{effectively}} as makeshift medical autoclaves in rural countries {{where there is no}} electrical infrastructure and where the cost of such a piece of equipment would otherwise be prohibitive. Although working on the same principle there are several operational differences such as professional autoclaves having purging ability to remove air before sterilization and having programmable control over the sterilization cycle. Education on usage is very important as the sterilization cycle is often much longer due to the presence of air in the <b>cooker</b> and most <b>pressure</b> <b>cookers</b> require modification to reach sufficient sterilization temperature which although within the capabilities of most <b>pressure</b> <b>cookers,</b> is still risky.
