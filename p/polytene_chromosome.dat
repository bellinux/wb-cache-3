40|$|In the Suppressor of Underreplication (SuUR) mutant {{strain of}} Drosophila melanogaster, the {{heterochromatin}} of <b>polytene</b> <b>chromosomes</b> is not underreplicated and, as a consequence, {{a number of}} P-heterochromatic regions acquire a banded structure. The chromocenter does not form in these <b>polytene</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> and heterochromatic regions, normally part of the chromocenter, become accessible to cytological analysis. We generated four genomic DNA libraries from specific heterochromatic regions by microdissection of <b>polytene</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> In situ hybridization of individual libraries onto SuUR <b>polytene</b> <b>chromosomes</b> shows that repetitive DNA sequences spread into the neighboring euchromatic regions. This observation allows the localization of eu-heterochromatin transition zones on <b>polytene</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> We find that genomic scaffolds from the eu-heterochromatin transition zones are enriched in repetitive DNA sequences homologous to those flanking the suppressor of forked gene [su(f) repeat]. We isolated and sequenced about 300 clones from the heterochromatic DNA libraries obtained. Most of the clones contain repetitive DNA sequences; however, some of the clones have unique DNA sequences shared with parts of unmapped genomic scaffolds. Hybridization of these clones onto SuUR <b>polytene</b> <b>chromosomes</b> allowed us to assign the cytological localizations of the corresponding genomic scaffolds within heterochromatin.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Polytene</b> <b>chromosome</b> banding {{patterns}} {{have long}} been used by Drosophila evolutionists to infer degree of relatedness among taxa. Recently, nucleotide sequences have preempted this traditional method. We place the classical Drosophila evolutionary biology tools of <b>polytene</b> <b>chromosome</b> inversion analysis in a phylogenetic context and assess their utility in comparison to nucleotide sequences. Results A simultaneous analysis framework {{was used to examine}} the congruence of the chromosomal inversion data with more recent DNA sequence data in four Drosophila species groups – the melanogaster, virilis, repleta, and picture wing. Inversions and nucleotides were highly congruent with one another based on incongruence length difference and partitioned Bremer support values. Inversion phylogenies were less resolved because of fewer numbers of characters. Partitioned Bremer supports, corrected for the number of characters in each matrix, were higher for inversion matrices. Conclusions <b>Polytene</b> <b>chromosome</b> data are highly congruent with DNA sequence data and, when placed in a simultaneous analysis framework, are shown to be more information rich than nucleotide data. </p...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the genetic {{analysis of a}} region of the third chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster extending from 87 D 2 – 4 to 87 E 12 –F 1, an interval of 23 or 24 <b>polytene</b> <b>chromosome</b> bands. This region includes the rosy (ry, 3 – 52. 0) locus, carrying the structural information for xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH). We have, in recent years, focused attention on the genetic regulation of the rosy locus and, therefore, wished to ascertain in detail the immediate genetic environment of this locus. Specifically, we question if rosy is a solitary genetic unit or {{part of a larger}} complex genetic unit encompassing adjacent genes. Our data also provide opportunity to examine further the relationship between euchromatic gene distribution and <b>polytene</b> <b>chromosome</b> structure. ——The results of our genetic dissection of the rosy microregion substantiate the conclusion drawn earlier (Schalet, Kernaghan and Chovnick 1964) that the rosy locus is the only gene in this region concerned with XDH activity and that all adjacent genetic units are functionally, as well as spatially, distinct from the rosy gene. Within the rosy micro-region, we observed a close correspondence between the number of complementation groups (21) and the number of <b>polytene</b> <b>chromosome</b> bands (23 or 24). Consideration of this latter observation in conjunction with those of similar studies of other chhromosomal regions supports the hypothesis that each <b>polytene</b> <b>chromosome</b> band corresponds to a single genetic unit...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background CG 11033 (dKDM 2) is the Drosophila homolog of {{the gene}} KDM 2 B. dKDM 2 {{has been known to}} possess histone lysine {{demethylase}} activity towards H 3 K 36 me 2 in cell lines and it regulates H 2 A ubiquitination. The human homolog {{of the gene}} has dual activity towards H 3 K 36 me 2 as well as H 3 K 4 me 3, and {{plays an important role in}} cellular senescence. Findings We have used transgenic flies bearing an RNAi construct for the dKDM 2 gene. The knockdown of dKDM 2 gene was performed by crossing UAS-RNAi-dKDM 2 flies with actin-Gal 4 flies. Western blots of acid extracted histones and immunofluoresence analysis of <b>polytene</b> <b>chromosome</b> showed the activity of the enzyme dKDM 2 to be specific for H 3 K 4 me 3 in adult flies. Immunofluoresence analysis of <b>polytene</b> <b>chromosome</b> also revealed the presence of multiple nucleoli in RNAi knockdown mutants of dKDM 2 and decreased H 3 -acetylation marks associated with active transcription.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{distribution}} of nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) particles in Drosophila <b>polytene</b> <b>chromosomes</b> {{has been investigated}} using anti-B- 36 serum as a probe. The use of <b>polytene</b> <b>chromosomes</b> allows resolution {{at the level of}} the chromomere, and provides the opportunity to look for both positive and negative correlations with transcriptional activity. The antiserum was obtained using the nuclear protein B- 36 from Physarum polycephalum as the immunogen. It has been shown to precipitate hnRNP particles from HeLa cells through a cross-reaction with the major 32, 000 - and 34, 000 -dalton hnRNP particle proteins. The antiserum cross-reacts with a Drosophila nuclear protein of 34, 000 daltons. By indirect immunofluorescence, we observed that the antiserum reacts preferentially with transcriptionally active loci of the <b>polytene</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> whereas loci previously or subsequently active do not show significant fluorescence. The overall pattern of fluorescence is very similar to that generated with anti-RNA polymerase B serum. The correlation of fluorescence and transcriptional activity observed suggests that the anti-B- 36 serum is recognizing hnRNP proteins which have combined with nascent RNA molecules at the sites of transcription.

We also demonstrated trans effects exerted by heterochromatic blocks on the replication of the rearranged heterochromatin; replication of transposed Stellate sequences was suppressed by a deletion of Xh and restored by addition of Y heterochromatin.
