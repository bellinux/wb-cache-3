Sponge iron and iron scrap is melted in electric arc furnaces, after which liquid steel is purified in secondary purification units. The steel’s chemical compound is designed by customer demand. Then, it is transported to casting machines for slab production. After cooling, slab is rolled at the hot rolling mill, creating hot coils (thickness: 1.5-16 mm). Some are sold; others {{go to the}} hot finishing mill for complementary work and hot sheet transformation or the cold rolling mill to lower strip thickness to 0.18 mm.

A relatively novel <b>prepaint</b> treatment, based on a peening process of plastic substrates with copper powders and performed inside an abrasive fluidized bed (AFB), is developed and analyzed. The influence of EFB coating process parameters, that is, coating time, voltage and flow rate, on the resulting polymeric films has been investigated in terms of coating thickness and average roughness. Subsequently, the location of part to be coated in the bed is studied. In particular, the influence on coating thickness of part attitude, radial location, dip distance and time has been considered. Finally, the curing kinetic of EP powders has been worked out and, therefore, the analysis of baking temperature able to produce the best curing condition of the polymeric films has been led, with particular regard to the estimation of film properties, that is, coating thickness and surface finishing as well as scratch adhesion and gloss. © 2006...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to estimate the prevalence of finger blanching among the workers in a shipyard of Korea using the dose-response relationship suggested by ISO 5349. The characteristics of vibration exposure produced by six types of grinders were investigated. Vibration measurement was made under the real work conditions. Exposure time was estimated by questionnaire and direct observation. In addition, cold provocation tests were performed, and the results from the tests were compared with the estimated prevalence. As a result, 4 hour-energyequivalent frequency-weighted accelerations of the finishing grinding (FG) and the <b>prepainting</b> grinding (PG) jobs were 6. 23 m/s 2 and 13. 39 m/s 2, respectively. The mean exposure time for holding the grinders was 4. 64 h per day. Using the ISO 5349 method, it was predicted that after exposure to vibration for 10. 79 yr, about a half of the FG workers could develop finger blanching. For the PG workers, the corresponding predicted latency was 5. 02 yr. A discrepancy was found between the results from the ISO relationship and those from the cold provocation tests. A linear regression model was suggested employing vibration acceleration and vibration exposure time as explanatory variables for vascular dysfunction...|$|R

50|$|Navia Dratp is a board game, {{played on}} a 7 by 7 grid (by contrast, chess uses an 8 by 8 grid and shogi uses a 9 by 9 grid). Each player begins the game with seven Black Gulled Stones, and two Red Gulled Stones, which can be roughly equated with the pawns of chess or shogi. In addition, each player chooses a Navia and seven Maseitai {{from his or her}} {{collection}} of pieces. Navias are <b>prepainted</b> miniatures of anime-style females. They serve roughly the same function as a chess or shogi king in that the capture of an opponent's Navia wins the game. Maseitai comprise the bulk of the collectible figures, and are generally more powerful than Gulled or Navias. Each Maseitai and Navia figure has a plastic disc called the compass that indicates the piece's movement abilities. By paying Gyullas crystals, which are earned by moving Gulled stones or by capturing your opponent's Maseitai, players can dratp Navia or Maseitai pieces, which allows the player to flip over the piece's compass, granting it different movement capabilities or other abilities. In the Navia's case, dratping it wins the game. This flipping over of pieces to grant them additional powers is similar to promotion in the game of shogi or checkers.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{significant}} debate {{about who is}} responsible for the regulation of nanotechnology. While some non-nanotechnology specific regulatory agencies currently cover some products and processes (to varying degrees) - by [...] "bolting on" [...] nanotechnology to existing regulations - there are clear gaps in these regimes. This enables some nanotechnology applications to figuratively [...] "slip through the cracks" [...] without being covered by any regulations. An example of this has occurred in the US, and involves nanoparticles of titanium dioxide (TI02) for use in sunscreen where they create a clearer cosmetic appearance. In this case, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed the immediate health effects of exposure to nanoparticles of titanium dioxide (TI02) for consumers. However, they did not review its impacts for aquatic ecosystems when the sunscreen rubs off, nor did the EPA, or any other agency. Similarly the Australian equivalent of the FDA, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved the use of nanoparticles in sunscreens (without the requirement for package labelling) after a thorough review of the literature, on the basis that although nanoparticles of TI02 and zinc oxide (ZN0) in sunscreens do produce free radicals and oxidative DNA damage in vitro, such particles were unlikely to pass the dead outer cells of the stratum corneum of human skin; a finding which some academics have argued seemed not to apply the precautionary principle in relation to prolonged use on children with cut skin, the elderly with thin skin, people with diseased skin or use over flexural creases. Doubts over the TGA's decision were raised with publication of a paper showing that the uncoated anatase form of TI02 used in some Australian sunscreens caused a photocatalytic reaction that degraded the surface of newly installed <b>prepainted</b> steel roofs in places where they came in contact with the sunscreen coated hands of workmen. Such gaps in regulation are likely to continue alongside the development and commercialization of increasingly complex second and third generation nanotechnologies.|$|E

Here, next-generation sequencing and microbial community finger printing (T-RFLP) were used to study the community composition of microbes colonizing <b>prepainted</b> steel roofing materials at Burrawang, Australia and Kapar, Malaysia over a 52 -week period. Community diversity was low and was dominated by Bacillus spp., cyanobacteria, actinobacteria, Cladosporium sp., Epicoccum nigrum, and Teratosphaeriaceae sp. Cultivation-based methods isolated approximately 20 different fungi and bacteria, some of which, such as E. nigrum and Cladosporium sp., were represented in the community sequence data. Fluorescence in situ hybridization imaging showed that fungi were the most dominant organisms present. Analysis of the sequence and T-RFLP data indicated that the microbial communities differed significantly between locations and changed significantly over time. The study demonstrates the utility of molecular ecology tools to identify and characterize microbial communities associated with the fouling of painted steel surfaces and ultimately can enable the targeted development of control strategies based on the dominant species responsible for fouling...|$|E
40|$|<b>Prepainted</b> metal sheets being {{environment}} friendly and cost effective {{as compared to}} postpainted metal sheets, are widely used in construction, packaging, transportation and automotive industries. One of the key requirements for <b>prepainted</b> coatings is to retain its surface quality and properties during forming process. During forming process, major surface damage occurs when the coated sheet is bent and un-bent around the die corner. To reduce surface damage of coatings, proper control of the parameters during forming and detail study of the surface conditions is required. In the present study, influence of forming parameters such as die radius, lubrication and specimen material are investigated. The influence of these parameters on friction, surface damage and properties of polymer coatings are evaluated. Experiment set-up is built to conduct bending under tension test. This test gives {{a better way to}} evaluate coating performance, as it closely simulates the die region of real forming process and considers bending effects. Experimental results show increase in friction and surface damage with decrease in die radius. Moreover, with decrease in die radius hardness of the coating decreases and strain in the specimen increases. Lubrication has some effect on coefficient of friction, but the influence is not as significant as that of die radius. This is attributed to the fact that, the polymer coating itself acts as a solid lubricant in the test. Material effect was studied, polypropylene coating being the softer material compared to PVDF coating shows more surface damage in the form of scratches. Numerical simulations were performed using Finite Element Analysis package (FEA) Abaqus. A 2 D model was built, exploiting the plane strain condition for bending under tension test. Numerical simulations indicate that maximum contact pressure and von Mises stress are concentrated {{at the beginning of the}} drawing edge. Apart from the location, the value of contact pressure was higher for smaller die radius. Thus, experiments help in studying the effect of forming parameters on coating performance and numerical simulations provide more insight into the critical areas where stresses are high. Numerical simulations also provide a scope to study the effect of material and geometric parameters on performance of coatings without running experiments...|$|E
40|$|AbstractApplication of {{the coating}} to {{material}} {{in a flat}} condition has economical, technological and ecological advantages. As the material is subsequently formed into shape not only the base material needs to withstand this process but the coating as well. Development of forming tools for coated metals is mainly concerned with the prediction of performance of the base material and does not analyse {{the condition of the}} coating. However, during the forming process, major surface damage can occur when the coated sheet is bent and unbent around the die geometry. To reduce surface damage of coatings, proper control of the parameters during forming and a detail study of the surface conditions is required. This research is conducted on metallically and organically coated sheet material which is commonly used for structural applications. The crack density of the coating is analysed during a deep drawing process and a forming limit diagram is obtained from the biaxial straining of the <b>prepainted</b> steel samples.

40|$|International audienceA {{substantial}} {{database of}} annual metal runoff loads, {{obtained from a}} 14 -month field exposure campaign on 12 different metal roofing materials at two sites within Paris conurbation, is presented herein. Thirteen metallic species have been considered. A comparison among the various roofing materials yields a ranking of their runoff pollution potential, which highlights that aluminum, coated products, and stainless steel display the lower emission levels, before zinc and copper materials. Lead materials appear to release more metallic species, and tend {{to do so in}} quite large quantities. Whatever the material family considered, older materials apparently release more metallic species with higher levels of emission. In considering zinc emissions from zinc-based materials, it is clear that surface coatings significantly reduce zinc emissions (40 % less for the Zn- 3 (PO 4) (2) surface-treated Anthra zinc, compared to natural zinc; and 99 % less for <b>prepainted</b> galvanized steel compared to standard galvanized steel). In the case of Anthra zinc however, surface treatment induces the release of Ni into the runoff, and Ni constitutes a priority pollutant in the European Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 CE).
