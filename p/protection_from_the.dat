5|$|Although many aborigines assumed Han {{religious}} practices, several sub-groups sought <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> European missionaries, who {{had started}} arriving in the 1860s. Many of the early Christian converts were displaced groups of Plains Aborigines that sought <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> oppressive Han. The missionaries, under the articles of extraterritoriality, offered a form of power against the Qing establishment and could thus make demands on the government to provide redress for the complaints of Plains Aborigines. Many of these early congregations have served to maintain aboriginal identity, language and cultures.|$|E

5|$|Stories of the Sea Mither and Teran {{are among}} Orkney's oldest legends, perhaps invented {{to explain the}} vagaries of weather and other {{naturally}} occurring events. In Shetland fishermen petition Sea Mither to afford them <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Devil.|$|E
50|$|Shelters are {{important}} for controlling body temperature and water regulation, as they allow desert tortoises to slow their rate of heating in summer and provide <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> cold during <b>the</b> winter. The humidity within burrows prevents dehydration. Burrows also provide <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> predators. <b>The</b> availability of adequate burrow sites influences desert tortoise densities.|$|R
5000|$|The Congregations Law of 1875 is a {{legislative}} bill of the Kulturkampf period that abolished religious orders, stopped state subsidies to the Catholic Church, and removed religious <b>protections</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Prussian constitution.

5|$|As is true {{for many}} species of deer, {{especially}} those in mountainous regions, elk migrate into areas of higher altitude in the spring, following the retreating snows, and the opposite direction in the fall. Hunting pressure also impacts migration and movements. During the winter, they favor wooded areas and sheltered valleys for <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wind and availability of tree bark to eat. Roosevelt elk are generally non-migratory due to less seasonal variability of food sources.|$|E
5|$|Deliberate self-harm is {{especially}} prevalent in prison populations. A proposed {{explanation for this}} is that prisons are often violent places, and prisoners who wish to avoid physical confrontations may resort to self-harm as a ruse, either to convince other prisoners that they are dangerously insane and resilient to pain or to obtain <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> prison authorities. Self-harm also occurs frequently in inmates who are placed in solitary confinement.|$|E
50|$|Cooperation {{also takes}} place through {{participation}} in two major annual data protection conferences: a European Conference that gathers data <b>protection</b> authorities <b>from</b> <b>the</b> EU Member States and the Council of Europe, and an International conference attended {{by a wide}} range of data <b>protection</b> experts, both <b>from</b> <b>the</b> public and private sectors.|$|R

5|$|In Missouri, at the Lisbon Bottoms {{section of}} the Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge, wild pallid {{sturgeon}} larvae were collected in 1998. These nonhatchery-raised larvae were the first recovered on the lower Missouri River in the previous 50years. The recovery was made along a side channel of the Missouri River that had been developed to provide suitable habitat for pallid sturgeon and other fish spawning. The side channel was apparently {{being used by the}} larva pallid sturgeon for <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> swifter currents of the Missouri River.|$|E
5|$|MSI {{displayed}} the Pioneer Zephyr outdoors, with no <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> weather, until 1994. At that time, the steam locomotive that shared the display space with the Zephyr, Santa Fe #2903, was {{donated to the}} Illinois Railway Museum (IRM) at Union, west of Chicago, while MSI prepared a new display location for the Zephyr.|$|E
5|$|Most {{noticeable}} of the N3 {{design was}} {{the concentration of}} the main battery forward of the bridge and machinery spaces. A related feature of the design was the tower bridge structure behind the first two gun turrets.

5|$|Needle {{receiving}} tubes: A hollow tube made of metal, shatter-resistant {{glass or}} plastic, needle receiving tubes, like forceps, {{are used to}} support the tissue at the piercing site and are common in septum and some cartilage piercings. Not only are these tubes intended to support the tissue, but they also receive the needle once it has passed through the tissue, offering <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sharp point. Needle receiving tubes are not used in the freehand piercing method.|$|E
5|$|Reptiles {{evolved from}} amphibious {{ancestors}} which left the aquatic lifestyle and became terrestrial. To prevent loss of moisture reptilian skin lost the softness and moisture of amphibian skin {{and developing a}} thick stratum corneum with multiple layers of lipids which served as an impermeable barrier as well as provided <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ultraviolet. Over time, reptilian skin cells became highly keratinised, horny, sturdy and desiccated. The surfaces of the dermis and epidermis of all reptilian scales form a single contiguous sheet, {{as can be seen}} when the snake sheds its skin as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Streamside camps offered wood, water, {{and some}} <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hazards of open land. The prairie could be {{dangerous}} in time of native unrest, and trade ceased entirely for a time during the Dakota War of 1862. Prairie fires, driven by winds, were a risk in dry spells. Wet weather turned rivers into torrents, approaches to streams into bogs, and worn paths into morasses. Blizzards could strand traders and threaten them with starvation. Insects harassed both the traders and their draft animals, depriving them of sleep and weakening them.|$|E

5|$|The Petition {{caused a}} flurry of {{broadside}} satires, poems and ballads on the subject through the following year. The historian James Turner identifies this event {{as an example of}} a new carnivalisation of sexuality in Restoration England, where genuine political attack, satire, street commentary and bawdy theatre came together. Two years after the riots, a mob gathered once more and again swore they would raze Cresswell's cathouse to the ground, though <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> local beadles prevented the attack.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek, {{including all}} of the streams and wetlands, has been significantly modified by both historical and modern land uses in the area. The natural surface water hydrology of the watershed was substantially modified by projects of the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental <b>Protection</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1950s until the 1990s. The sediment retention structure in The Hollow was constructed in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} at least one report of {{deliberate}} vandalism to the structure, but the primary concern relating to visitors to the site {{is the possibility of}} damage caused through tread wear. The site is not heavily trafficked and any wear to the structure since the 1980s would likely be mitigated by the <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> natural re-establishment of plant growth over its surface. Updates by the North York Moors National Park authority and English Heritage suggest that natural weathering and grazing sheep represent greater erosion risks to the structure than do human agents.|$|E
50|$|Commercial {{hunting and}} {{the sale of}} {{wildlife}} is prohibited to ensure the sustainability of wildlife population. This principle holds that unregulated economic markets for game and nongame wildlife are unacceptable because they privatize a common resource and lead to declines. The Lacey Act of 1900 effectively made market hunting illegal in the United States, and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 provided international <b>protections</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> market.|$|R

5|$|Vehicles {{built in}} 1940 (only) were fitted with {{removable}} loading ramps, cable rollers {{to act as}} pulleys, and a reinforced tail gate to allow a Flak 30, mounted on a Sd.Ah. 51 trailer, to be quickly dismounted. From 1940 they were fitted with rifle racks over the front fenders and from 1942 these were given sheet metal covers as <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> weather. Flak 38s were mounted on 10/4s beginning in 1941 although the platform wasn't widened until later. As the war progressed the guns were more often fitted with gun shields.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of 19 November, a {{thunderstorm}} followed by a drenching downpour broke over the opposing armies. In a few hours every wadi in the foothills and on the plain was in flood. The black soil plain, hard and firm during summer, became in these winter conditions sticky and heavy for marching and almost impassable for wheeled vehicles. The temperature, which had been hot {{during the day and}} pleasant at night, dropped rapidly to become piercingly cold. The infantrymen had been marching light in their summer uniform of twill shorts and tunics. With only one blanket (and/or a Greatcoat), this gear gave little <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> driving rain and bitter chill.|$|E

Typically, academic and office buildings are referred to primarily by number while residence halls are referred to by name. The organization of building numbers roughly corresponds to {{the order in which}} the buildings were built and their location relative (north, west, and east) to the original center cluster of Maclaurin buildings. Many of the buildings are connected above ground as well as through an extensive network of underground tunnels, providing <b>protection</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Cambridge weather as well as a venue for roof and tunnel hacking.|$|E
