40|$|What does an {{orbiting}} microsatellite, {{a robotic}} lander and a ruggedized camera and telescope have in common? They are all fast paced, low cost projects managed by Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) teamed with successful industry partners. MSFC {{has long been}} synonymous with human space flight large propulsion programs, engineering acumen and risk intolerance. However, {{there is a growing}} portfolio/product line within MSFC that focuses on these smaller, fast paced projects. While launching anything into space is expensive, using a managed risk posture, holding to schedule and keeping costs low by stopping at egood enough f were key elements to their success. Risk is defined as the possibility of loss or failure per Merriam Webster. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) defines risk using procedural requirement 8705. 4 and establishes eclasses f to discern the acceptable risk per a project. It states a Class D risk has a medium to significant risk of not achieving mission success. MSFC, along with industry partners, has created a niche in Class D efforts. How did the big, cautious MSFC succeed on these projects that embodied the antithesis of its heritage in human space flight? A key factor toward these successful projects was innovative industry partners such as Dynetics Corporation, University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAHuntsville), Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU APL), Teledyne Brown Engineering (TBE), Von Braun Center for Science and Innovation (VCSI), SAIC, and Jacobs. Fast Affordable Satellite Technology (FastSat HSV 01) is a low earth orbit microsatellite that houses six instruments with the primary scientific objective of earth observation and technology demonstration. The team was comprised of Dynetics, UAHuntsvile, SAIC, Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and VCSI with the United States Air Force Space Test Program as the customer. The team completed design, development, manufacturing, environmental test and integration in one year. FastSat HSV 01 also deployed a Poly Picosatellite Orbital Deployer (PPOD) for a separate nano]satellite class spacecraft (Cubesat: Nano Sail Demonstration) in partnership with Ames Research Center. The Robotic lunar lander is a MSFC JHU APL partnership that {{led to the development of}} a flexible architecture for landers to support robotic missions to a wide range of lunar and asteroid destinations. The team started with the goal of meeting NASA agency directives that led to the creation of a test bed focusing on GN&C and software to demonstrate the descent and landing on any airless body for the final 30 to 60 meters. The team created a complex technology demonstration as well as Guidance Control and Navigation (GN&C) algorithms providing autonomous control of the lander. The team uses a green propellant of 90 % hydrogen peroxide and has completed 18 successful test flights. The International Space Station (ISS) SERVIR Environmental Research and Visualization System (ISERV) is a technology demonstration payload to assist the SERVIR project with environmental monitoring for disaster relief and humanitarian efforts. The ISERV project was a partnership with TBE. The ISERV payload consists of a commercial off the shelf camera, telescope, and MSFC developed <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>box</b> and interfaces on ISS with the Window Observational Research Facility in the US Lab. MSFC has identified three key areas that enabled the low cost mission success to include culture, partnering, and cost/schedule control. This paper will briefly discuss these three Class D efforts, FastSat HSV- 01, the Robotic Lunar Lander and the ISERV camera system, the lessons learned, their successes and challenges...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{two-phase}} <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> {{scheme for}} supporting quality-of-service (QoS) and best effort traffic is proposed. We first formulate the <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> for QoS traffic as an optimization problem {{so that the}} number of simultaneously transmitting connections is maximized. Optimum <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> is difficult to implement in practice due to both the computational complexity and the requirement for global information about the mobile station (MS) locations, connection channel conditions, and traffic load in the system. We then propose a heuristic scheme of <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> for soft handoff (SHO) connections. The full scheme includes an initial <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> (IPD) and a <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> adjustment (PDA). IPD allocates BS power resource based on the channel condition of each individual connection, while PDA further coordinates the <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> between neighboring base stations (BSs) in order to accommodate more connections. The proposed <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> scheme can achieve a capacity close to that of the optimum <b>power</b> <b>distribution,</b> while providing much higher transmission throughput for best effort data traffic. The proposed <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> scheme can be applied to existing SHO schemes for efficient BS power resource usage. The scheme does not require global information, and its implementation can be further simplified by performing IPD only with slight performance degradation.

Two types of interdigitated and paired <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grids {{with multiple}} supply voltages and multiple grounds are presented. Analytic models are also developed to estimate the loop inductance in four types of proposed power delivery schemes. Two proposed schemes, fully and pseudo-interdigitated power delivery, reduce power supply voltage drops as compared to conventional interdigitated <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> systems with dual supplies and a single ground by, on average, 15. 3 % and 0. 3 %, respectively. The performance of the proposed on-chip <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grids is compared to a reference <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grid with a single supply and a single ground. The voltage drop in fully interdigitated and fully paired <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grids with multiple supplies and multiple grounds is reduced, on average, by 2. 7 % and 2. 3 %, respectively, {{as compared to the}} voltage drop of an interdigitated <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grid with a single supply and a single ground.
