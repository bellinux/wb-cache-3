When too much energy {{is used for}} the pulse duration, structural failure of the glass envelope can occur. Flashtubes produce an electrical arc flash contained in a glass tube. As the arc develops, a supersonic shock-wave forms, traveling radially {{from the center of the}} arc and impacting the inner wall of the tube. If the energy level is low enough, a tap against the glass is all that will be heard. However, if the energy level used equals the [...] "explosion energy" [...] rating of the lamp, the impacting shock wave will fracture the glass, rupturing the tube. The resulting explosion creates a loud, sonic shock-wave, and may throw shattered glass several feet. The explosion energy is calculated by multiplying the internal surface-area of the lamp, between the electrodes, with the <b>power-loading</b> capacity of the glass. Power loading is determined by the type and thickness of the glass, and the cooling method that is used. Power loading is measured in watts per centimeter squared. However, because the pulsed-power level increases as the flash duration decreases, the explosion energy must then be decreased in direct proportion to the square root of discharge time.|$|E

In maximally activated myocyte preparations, shortening velocities appeared to remain constant during load clamps in which shortening {{took place over}} a sarcomere length range of ≈ 2. 30 - 2. 00 μm. These results suggest that previously reported curvilinear length traces during load clamps of multicellular preparations were {{due in part to}} extracellular viscoelastic structures that give rise to restoring forces during myocardial shortening. During submaximal Ca 2 + activations, the velocity of shortening at low loads slowed and the time course of shortening became curvilinear, i. e. velocity progressively slowed as shortening continued. This result implies that cross-bridge cycling kinetics are slower at low levels of activation and that an internal load arises during shortening of submaximally activated myocytes, perhaps due to slowly detaching cross-bridges. Reduced levels of activator Ca 2 + also reduced maximal power output and increased the relative load at which power output was optimal. For a given absolute load, the shift has the effect of maintaining power output near the optimum level despite reductions in cross-bridge number and force generating capability at lower levels of Ca 2 +...|$|R

Based on Michel Foucault’s analytics of government – notably the notion of self-technologies – we analyse two empower-ment projects for women.

Thus, empowerment should be viewed not as a transfer of power to individuals who formerly possessed little or no power, but as a technology seeking to create self-governing and responsible individuals, i. e. modern citizens in the western liberal sense. Second, through the intertwinement of anthropo-logical knowledges and radical action research, knowledge about the local has become an authoritative mode of veridiction (regime of truth) in development interventions.

Since the direct formulation of this problem turns out to be nonconvex, we develop various alternative convex formulations using techniques of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and second-order cone programming (SOCP). In particular, we show that the optimal MMSE transceiver design problem can be reformulated as a semidefinite program (SDP), which can be solved using highly efficient interior point methods. When the channel matrices are diagonal (as in cyclic prefixed multicarrier systems), we show that the optimal MMSE transceivers can be obtained by subcarrier allocation and optimal power loading to each subcarrier for all the users. Moreover, the optimal subcarrier allocation and <b>power-loading</b> can be computed fairly simply (in polynomial time) by the relative ratios of the magnitudes of the subchannel gains corresponding to all subcarriers.

40|$|The {{development}} of {{power line communication}} systems for broadband multimedia applications requires a comprehensive knowledge of the channel characteristics and the main peculiarities that may influence the communication over this channel. PLC {{has the potential to}} become the preferred connectivity solution to homes and offices. Additionally, indoor power line networks can serve as local area networks offering high-speed data, audio, video and multimedia applications. The PLC technology eliminates the need for new wires by using an already-existing infrastructure that is much more pervasive than any other wired system. Power line networks, however, present a hostile channel for communication signals. Noise, multipath, selective fading and attenuation are well-known peculiarities of power line grids and. Particularly, random impulsive noise characterized with short durations and very high amplitudes is identified as one of the major impairments that degrade the performance of PLC systems. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is the technique of choice for broadband PLC systems. OFDM minimizes the effects of multipath and provides high robustness against selective fading. It is also powerful in impulsive noise environments and performs better than single-carrier modulation methods. If an OFDM symbol is affected by impulsive noise, the effect is spread over multiple subcarriers due to the discrete Fourier transform at the receiver. In order to achieve reliable outcomes, suitable channel and noise models must be used in the investigations. In this thesis, the power line channel transfer function is modelled using a multipath model that was proposed by Zimmermann and Dostert [1], [2]. This model describes the signal propagation scenario and attenuation effects in power line networks. To represent the actual noise scenario in power networks, the noise is classified into two main classes: background noise and impulsive noise. To reduce the effect of impulsive noise, conventional time domain nonlinearities are examined in this thesis under PLC environments. An adaptive-threshold selection method based on minimum bit-error rate (BER) is proposed. At the cost of additional complexity, the effect of impulsive noise is further mitigated using a novel joint time-domain/frequency-domain suppression technique. Since channel coding is essential for most telecommunication systems, we examine convolutional codes combined with interleaving in a PLC channel impaired with AWGN and impulsive noise. The results show substantial performance gains especially in heavily-disturbed environments, where signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gains of more than 15 dB can be achieved with a code rate of 1 / 3. Bit-interleaved convolutionally-coded OFDM completely eliminates the effect of impulsive noise in weakly-disturbed noise environments, while a negligible effect may remain in medium-disturbed environments. A new <b>power-loading</b> algorithm that minimizes the transmission power for target BER and data rate constraints is introduced in later chapters of the thesis. Results indicate that the algorithm achieves performance gains of more than 4 dB SNR over conventional OFDM systems. Furthermore, a novel minimum-complexity bit-loading algorithm that maximizes the data rate given BER and power level constraints is proposed in chapter 6. Results show that this bit-loading algorithm achieves almost identical performance as the incremental algorithm but with much lower complexity...|$|E

This technology uses industry-standard dc-dc converters and a unique interconnection to provide size, weight, efficiency, fault tolerance, and modularity benefits over existing systems. The high-voltage SCBR shown in the photograph has demonstrated power densities of over 1000 watts per kilogram (W/kg). Using four 150 -W dc-dc converter modules, it can process 2500 W of power at 120 Vdc with a minimum input voltage of 90 Vdc. Efficiency of the SCBR was 94 to 98 percent over the entire operational range. Internally, the unit is made of two separate SCBR s, each with its own analog control circuitry, to demonstrate the modularity of the technology. The analog controllers regulate the output current and incorporate the output voltage limit with active current sharing between the two units. They also include voltage and current telemetry, on/off control, and baseplate temperature sensors.

The situation of women is particularly often targeted in the Development discourses and buzzwords like women's empowerment", Gender equality" and Gender Based Violence" are commonly used, e. g. in reports and awareness campaigns. The term Gender only recently has a translation in the national language Bislama: jenda, but the concept of Gender is not necessarily understandable because of that. Using Gender as a concept metaphor, this thesis examines, how concepts from the Development sphere are communicated to non-elite Ni-Vanuatu women and men. The processes of translation (literally, as well as figuratively) happens in a sphere between Development discourses and everyday life experiences of Ni-Vanuatu; a sphere I call the gap. In this <b>power-loaded</b> gap, a group of cultural translators" emerged, who are usually Ni-Vanuatu themselves, but have access to education and economical wealth - an emerging elite. Inspired by Sally Engle Merry's approach to analysing the space between transnational Human Rights and local activism, this thesis will combine theories of translation and (mis) understanding in order to spotlight some processes inside the gap. Especially Edda Weigand's linguistic model of misunderstandings appear helpful to uncover some ontological differences. By looking at the language and methods used in a national survey on women's lives, as well as an analysis of the rhetoric used in an awareness campaign against Violence Against Women, the thesis shows the premises, which these forms of communication are built on and places them into a wider frame of power/knowledge dynamics. The thesis juxtaposes the discourse analysis with two Ni-Vanuatu key concepts, the concept of angkel and the practice of braed praes, which have often been confused with eurocentric concepts of uncle and bride price. Based on this confusion, important ontological concepts of personhood and Gender have been misunderstood.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{development}} of smart grids, especially the vast deployment of smart meters, enables users to access their energy {{data on a}} much more detailed scale. This has promoted considerable interest in nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) research. It is hoped that NILM techniques can separate energy-consumption data into individual appliance levels, thereby aiding customers who want to save energy or cut back usage. For this dissertation, we implemented a novel NILM system based on a support vector machine (SVM), an edge symbol analysis method (ESA), and principal power component analysis (PPCA). Our research uses a set of power load disaggregation methods, which constitute {{the most important part}} of our NILM system. Furthermore, our system automatically monitors a household power consumption and the power consumption of individual devices. We have developed the means to automatically detect a <b>power-load</b> event and the means to classify appliances based on machine learning. Our methods involve a new transient-detection algorithm. By analysing turn-on and turn-off transients, it can accurately detect the points when a device is switched on or switched off. The proposed load classification technique can identify different power appliances with better recognition accuracy and computational speed. The load classification method comprises two items: frequency feature analysis and a support vector machine. Our results indicate that by incorporating the new edge detection and turn-on, turn-off transient signature analyses into our NILM, more information is revealed than by traditional NILM methods. The load classification method achieved more than 90 percent recognition rate. We also propose a multiple class support vector machine to recognize different appliances. The approach consists of two stages. In stage one, feature analysis is applied to power signals. In stage two, a trained classifier based on SVM was applied to identify different appliances. Our experiment results on real data give better performance compared to other studies that have used supervised classification for household power-appliance monitoring. Our contributions also focus on feature extraction and pattern analysis for whole-house power load classification and disaggregation. Specifically, after finding a specific power event (such as a switch-on or switch-off) and clustering data in terms of power factor, the optimized features can be obtained from our algorithm by looking at harmonics of active/reactive power and using eigenvalue feature analysis. The experiments, based on real world data, give higher recognition accuracy and faster computational speed, and represent a promising approach for distinguishing different loads effectively...|$|R

This machine-readable version of John Williams' Digest of Welsh Historical Statistics {{is the result of}} a collaboration between the Statistical Directorate of the National Assembly for Wales, the History Data Service and the Centre for Data Digitisation and Analysis at Queen's University Belfast. John Williams' Digest of Welsh Historical Statistics is intended to provide a service for those working on the history of modern Wales. It arises from a belief that the quantitative element is a necessary and important part of the historical record; from an awareness that it was an aspect that was particularly inaccessible for scholars of Welsh history; and from a conviction that some encouragement in the use of quantitative material was necessary. It is modelled on the two volumes dedicated to British historical statistics: Mitchell, B. R. and Deane, P. (1962) Abstract of British historical statistics and Mitchell, B. R. and Jones, H. G. (1971) Second abstract of British historical statistics. Main Topics : The main tables are: Output and number of collieries, North Wales and South Wales, 1854 - 1874 Output. Numbers employed and output per head, by region and county, 1874 - 1945 Output. Numbers employed and productivity, North Wales and South Wales, 1945 - 1974 Output of anthracite, South Wales and UK, 1854 - 1974 Output from government open-cast workings, South Wales, 1943 - 1972 Output and numbers employed, South Wales, as a percentage of UK, 1874 - 1974 Shipments (coastal and foreign) from South Wales ports, 1816 - 1974 Shipments. Exports of coal, coke and patent fuel from South Wales ports, 1854 - 1937 Shipments. Foreign and coastal shipments from each port (Cardiff, Swansea, Newport, Llanelli, Milford, Neath, Porthcawl), 1780 - 1974 Colliery deaths, number and rate, underground and total, South Wales, 1853 - 1974; and North Wales (number only), 1853 - 1938 Mechanisation. Number, type and work done by mechanical coal cutters; number of coal conveyers; and amount of electricity used in mines, North Wales and South Wales, 1900 - 1945 Mechanisation. Percentage of coal output cut and conveyed by machinery (1937 - 1960); and percentage <b>power-loaded</b> (194 7 - 1975), South Wales, 1937 - 1975 Prices. Average pit head prices, North Wales and South Wales, 1878 - 1938; and f. o. b. prices for steam coal (large and small), South Wales, 1840 - 1934 Costs and proceeds. Average wage coal, total cost and proceeds, per ton, North Wales and South Wales, 1917 - 1974 The number and annual output of members of the Coal Owners' Association, 1863 - 1946 Output from Aberdare parish, 1844 - 1874; and coal carried by the Taff Vale Railway, 1841 - 1921 Output of coke and number of coke ovens, South Wales, 1905 - 1974 Please note: this study does not include information on named individuals and would therefore not be useful for personal family history research. <br...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{the squat}} {{exercise}} (and its derivatives) in gym-based settings is widespread owing to perceived functional performance enhancing effects. In particular, there has been preponderance amongst practitioners with loads that maximise power outputs (Pmax) based on a perception that mechanical peak power {{is directly related to}} explosive functional performance such as sprinting ability. The optimal muscular quality associated with squats remains elusive though, mostly due to methodological limitations in the research. The four experimental studies in this thesis sought to quantify the kinetic and kinematic outputs of a machine squat-jump and their relationship to sprinting ability, both descriptively and across a training period. First, an analysis of the kinetic and kinematic outputs of a machine squat-jump across a spectrum of loads was performed, with an emphasis on power output. Then, the relationship of these outputs with sprint ability was investigated. Correlations do not imply cause and effect, thus a training intervention was undertaken to quantify the relationships of the change in performance measures over time, and allow a comparison of different training protocols. Specifically, one training group was prescribed training loads based on individually determined peak power outputs, and the other based on traditional maximal strength training loads. Because the intention of this thesis was to enhance our knowledge of best strength training practice for elite sporting performance, highly trained athletes were specifically chosen as subjects, cognizant of the population specific nature of training adaptation. In study one, it was determined that the point on the <b>power-load</b> spectrum where peak and mean power occurred in the machine squat-jump was 21. 6 ± 7. 1 % 1 RM (mean ± SD) and 39. 0 ± 8. 6 % 1 RM respectively although there was considerable individual variation in these points. A broad plateau in power outputs was evident for most subjects with at most a 9. 9 % (90 % confidence limits ± 2. 4 %) difference in peak or means power at loads up to 20 % 1 RM either side of the peak. Studies two and three established that, of the multiple kinetic and kinematic measures investigated, only 1 RM strength, work and impulse (all relative to body mass) provided any indication of useful kinetic / kinematic outputs that were potentially worthwhile developing for enhancing sprint performance, albeit with only moderate correlations (r = ~ - 0. 3). Additionally, the intercorrelations between maximal strength and explosive kinetic and kinematic measures were only moderate (r = ~ 0. 3), casting doubt on the common practice of pursuing high 1 RM strength with the intention of improving explosive muscle performance. The training study provided evidence that training at the load that maximised individual peak power output was no more effective for improving sprint ability than training at heavy loads and the changes in kinetic and kinematic outputs were not usefully related to changes in sprint ability...|$|R
