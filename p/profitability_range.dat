Thus, {{there is a need to}} monitor the response of corn grain yield to plant population for new hybrids, and to determine whether this response interacts with agronomic factors. From 2005 to 2008, experiments were conducted 16 following soybean [Glycine max (L.)

Averaged across locations, the response of grain yield to plant population was not affected by planting date or row width, but 94 - to 96 -day corn hybrids had an economically optimum final plant population that was 3, 200 plants/acre higher than that of 102 -day hybrids at a corn price of $ 3. 50 /bushel and a seed cost of $ 250 / 80, 000 seeds. Averaged across all experiments, the plant population needed to maximize <b>profitability</b> <b>ranged</b> from about 32, 000 to 34, 000 plants/acre under current economic conditions.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} scholarship {{over the last}} fifty years on the causes of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century British railway industry’s declining profitability. Nonetheless, scholars have largely avoided studying how individual companies’ were managed, instead making general conclusions about the challenges industry leaders faced and the quality of their responses. This thesis examines the management of one of the British railway industry’s largest companies, the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), during the tenures of three of its General Managers: Archibald Scott, who was in the post between 1870 and 1884, Charles Scotter, who succeeded him from 1885 to 1897, and Charles Owens, who held the position between 1898 and 1911. Compared with other major British railways the LSWR’s <b>profitability</b> <b>ranged</b> from being poor under Scott, to excellent under Scotter and then average under Owens. This thesis will explore what internal and external factors caused these changes. Furthermore, it considers how the business’ organisational form, senior managers’ career paths and directors’ external business interests all played a role in shaping the company’s operational efficiency and financial performance. Ultimately, the thesis will argue that while external factors were an influence on the LSWR’s profitability between 1870 and 1911, primarily its financial performance was determined by the quality of the strategies and policies enacted by its directors and managers. Ultimately, this thesis brings clarity to the existing debates and, by using the LSWR as a case study, provides important suggestions as to what actually caused the British railway industry’s declining profitability between 1870 and 1911...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{potential}} benefits of irrigation system evaluations are explored through the analysis of results from a case study. The effects of application depth, operating pressure, distribution uniformity and scheduling technique were evaluated using the ZIMsched 2. 0 irrigation systems and crop yield simulation model. Data measured from on-farm irrigation system evaluations performed in Pongola in 2001 and again in 2003, were used in ZIMsched 2. 0 to simulate sugarcane yield and water use for the period 1980 to 2000. The simulated crop yield and water use results facilitated a comparison of relative profit margins. The system performance, in terms of uniformity and application depth, was poorer in 2001 than in 2003, largely as the result of low system operating pressures in 2001. Results from the simulations show that with the scheduling practice followed by the farmer in 2001, these low system pressures resulted in reduced water applications. This in-turn resulted in reduced simulated sugarcane yields but an increase in irrigation efficiency, as there were fewer losses due to runoff and deep percolation. The calculated electricity and water costs were also lower in 2001 than in 2003. The system was upgraded in 2002 and the simulations undertaken using the 2003 system evaluation data showed increases in crop yield, water use and profitability, despite the accompanying increases in the calculated electricity and water costs. The improvement in the uniformity of the system from a DUlq of 61 % to a DUlq of 68 % had little effect on the simulated yields. For the case study, the greatest benefit of an irrigation system evaluation was that it provided information which facilitated making improvements to seasonal water applications. Based on simulated yields and water use, the impacts of these improvements on <b>profitability</b> <b>ranged</b> from R 164 to R 1882 /ha...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{photovoltaic}} industry {{growth in}} recent years has surpassed any other renewable energy sources worldwide and the need for carbon neutral electricity will continue to increase. In developed countries solar PV is a proven and feasible technology, however in African countries it is almost inexistent. So the fact that most PV systems are installed in rich countries with low solar radiation instead of sunny Africa does not add up. For this reason, the aim of this report is to assess the feasibility of developing a large scale solar PV plant in Africa, more specifically Ghana. The installation of 100 MW of solar PV is assumed in a pre-determined location in Ghana, where solar irradiation is the highest. The computation of total plant generation uses solar maps, PV modules specification and average benchmark figures for system losses. Furthermore a review of policy framework a Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) for solar PV development in Ghana is carried out to assert the viability of the project. Ultimately, an economic analysis is carried out via using cash flow models in Excel work sheets. The key financial indicators used for evaluation of the project include net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), benefit-to-cost ratio (B/C) and Payback period (PBP). A comprehensive risk assessment is used to identify and create risk mitigating strategies. The sensitivity analysis creates a strategy to deal with the risk of inflation and currency depreciation. The sensitivity analysis shows that the project <b>profitability</b> <b>ranges</b> from - 20 to 140 million US dollars under tight inflation and currency boundary conditions.

40|$|For {{more than}} thirty years, studies {{about the effect of}} the {{exchange}} rate on exports have been conducted. However, few have considered the combined effect of the exchange rate on imported inputs into the agricultural system and the exports of final agricultural products those inputs produce. A current concern is for the net effect as the total value and quantity of inputs imported has increased. This research examines the effect of exchange rate changes on imported inputs into the corn, wheat, and beef cattle production systems. Effects on cost of production budgets are calculated, examining affects on profitability. Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Bayesian Averaging of Classical Estimates (BACE) models were estimated to evaluate those effects. Daily and weekly price data were used for corn, wheat, feeder steers, ethanol, diesel, ammonia, urea, di-ammonium phosphate, and the exchange rate. A VAR model was estimated to model the relationship between the variables. After having incongruous test results in determining the lag length structure it was decided that a BACE model would be approximated. After estimating the BACE model the price responses of the commodities to the exchange rates was estimated. The price responses were used in demonstrating the effect of the exchange rate on a producer’s profitability. It was determined that, generally, a strengthening exchange rate has a negative impact on prices. It was also found that the exchange rate has a greater impact on prices now than it did 14 years ago, implying that the exchange rate now has a greater affect on profitability. A one percent increase {{in the value of the}} dollar led to a decline in <b>profitability</b> <b>ranging</b> from $ 0. 02 /bu in wheat to $ 0. 56 /cwt in feeder steers.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{designed}} {{to assess the impact}} of market segmentation practices on the profitability of small and medium scale furniture manufacturing enterprises in Hawassa city. Market segmentation has been defined as dividing a market into smaller groups of buyers with distinct need, characteristics or behavior, which might require separate products or marketing mixes. Small and medium scale business is a business which is independently owned and operated, not dominant in its field of operation and meets certain standard of number of employee and capital. Profitability for a period in this study is typically defined as the earnings of an investment during the period divided by the capital employed in the investment at that time. In order to achieve the objective of the study, both primary and secondary data sources were employed. The data were collected through a questionnaire which has three parts, i. e. demographic, market segmentation and profitability questionnaires which are developed based on the theoretical assessment of related literatures. The questionnaires were distributed to 60 SMEs in which only 48 were fully completed and returned. The data collected were analyzed using SPSS software such as correlation and multiple Regression analysis. On the basis of the data obtained from the respondents, the study identified that there exists a positive significant relationship between market segmentation practices and <b>profitability</b> <b>ranging</b> from medium to substantial in the selected sample SMEs. The findings of this study also revealed the levels and bases of market segmentation used in the enterprises as well as their relationship with profitability as its major findings.

40|$|Retained {{ownership}} is a marketing strategy that involves maintaining ownership of young cattle beyond calf weaning, a traditional marketing time for many producers. Numerous retained ownership strategies exist. It {{is extremely important}} for producers and their lenders to clearly understand {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of a specific retained ownership strategy in order to fully evaluate profit potential. The advantages and disadvantages of retained ownership have been discussed by several authors. Advantages include 1) compensation for superior genetics, 2) reduction in market inefficiencies, 3) increased quality control in beef, 4) reduction in market risk for frost or drought damaged crops and 5) reduction in profitability peaks and valleys associated with cattle cycles. Retained ownership of cattle is not without problems. Disadvantages include 1) increased risk of poor performance due to poor genetics, health problems or deteriorating environmental conditions, 2) increased market risk, 3) increased financing requirements and 4) potential tax problems. Nearly every economic analysis of retained ownership has shown an increase in profitability over traditional cow-calf operations. Data adapted from the Kansas Steer Futurity (Simms and Maddux, 1990) are displayed in Table 1. Average annual net returns per cow through weaning were $ 4. 84 from 1974 - 1988. Negative returns averaging -$ 43. 81 were observed for 8 of the 14 years. Average annual returns per cow for the feedlot phase of production were $ 27. 13. Negative returns averaging -$ 35. 56 were observed in 5 of the 14 years. Returns for the combined cow-calf and feedlot phases of production averaged $ 31. 97. This represents a 6. 6 -fold increase in profitability as compared to marketing the calf crop at weaning. Losses averaging -$ 40. 69 were observed in 6 of the 14 years. A 1990 - 91 South Dakota Retained Ownership Demonstration Program (Wagner et al., 1991) showed average profits of $ 38. 75 and $ 16. 69 for an accelerated finishing program and a traditional two-phased growing and finishing program, respectively. The variability in profitability between groups of cattle representing different genetic and management backgrounds was tremendous. <b>Profitability</b> <b>ranged</b> from -$ 56. 57 to $ 131. 36 per head and 7 of 51 groups of five steers in the accelerated pen lost money...|$|R

A comparison of the <b>profitability</b> of a <b>range</b> of farming systems including annual crop-based systems, annual crop-dominated agroforestry systems, perennial crop-dominated agroforestry systems and perennial cropping systems was undertaken to determine which of these systems would be most attractive to farmers. A survey of 300 farming households was conducted in Claveria, Misamis Oriental, Philippines to determine which among the alternative farming systems in the area was most profitable.

For each farming system, revenues from the crop, fruit, timber and livestock components were computed separately. The costs incurred in each of the farming strategies were classified into investment costs, cash operating expenses, and non-cash operating expenses. Among the three annual crop-based systems, the annual mono-cropping of corn (corn-corn) was predicted to generate the lowest NPV (PhP 43, 607) followed by the tomato crop (PhP 66, 852).

In 2000, the Australian Dairy Research and Development Corporation conducted a large-scale telephone survey of 1826 Australian dairy farms to examine current on-farm management practices in relation to milk production and farm and farmer demographics (DRDC 2001). The questionnaire results from the 196 dairy farms in the sub-tropical region of South East Queensland and Northern New South Wales were analysed in three steps. Firstly, multiple linear regression models were produced for all dairy farms within the region. Secondly, farms that produced less than 750 kL per annum were treated as a separate population and a specific model was developed for these cases. Finally, farms that produced in excess of 750 kilolitres (kL) were analyzed and a linear model was developed for members of this population. An important outcome of the analysis was the construction of management profiles of farmers in different milk production classes, in particular, identification of the specific management practices which define a farmer’s ability to produce optimal yield.

This thesis presents a basic understanding and characterization of the laser measurement system necessary for successful implementation into an experimental environment. A personal computer to LMS software interface is also presented. The SICK Company provides software for acquisition which displays a scanned profile in real time, but it does not have the provision for saving the acquired image and corresponding data, nor is it suited for on demand modifications such as actively setting the operation mode of the LMS. Having software to handle the communication between the LMS and PC that can be seamlessly integrated into an experimental environment is essential. The laser scanner then becomes an onboard sensor with the capability of sourcing real time data for use in pose estimation or an online control algorithm, among other possibilities. (cont.)

The net effect on global warming potential (GWP) also depends on the net fluxes of greenhouse gases from land-use systems following deforestation. Efforts to mitigate these effects {{must take into account}} not only the greenhouse gas fluxes of alternative land-use systems but also the social and economic consequences that influence their widespread adoption. The global alternatives to slash-and-burn program (ASB) investigated the net greenhouse gas emissions and <b>profitability</b> of a <b>range</b> of land-use alternatives in the humid tropics. The analysis showed that many tree-based systems reduced net GWP compared to annual cropping and pasture systems. Some of these systems are also profitable in terms of returns to land and labor. The widespread adoption of these systems, however, can be limited by start-up costs, credit limitations, and number of years to positive cash flow, in addition to the higher labor requirements. Projects that offset carbon emissions through carbon sinks in land use in the tropics might be a means of overcoming these limitations. A synthesis of the findings from this program can provide guidelines for the selection and promotion of land-use practices that minimize net global warming effects of slash-and-burn.

40|$|Switchgrass, a warm-season {{perennial}} grass, {{native to}} the region, has received considerable interest for its potential role as a dedicated feedstock for cellulosic-based bio-fuels. This research examined the farm-gate price needed for switchgrass to provide per-acre net returns equal to those obtained from traditional crops in south central North Dakota. Future production costs for switchgrass and net returns from traditional crops were estimated for three soil productivity classes and also were developed to reflect the historical revenue and cost patterns associated with producers who are typically more or less profitable (i. e., average net return per acre) than regional averages. Prices were calculated using an annualized equivalent analysis of switchgrass production costs and net returns from traditional crops from 2008 through 2017. Switchgrass production costs ranged from just over $ 40 per ton on marginal soils to $ 34. 80 per ton on highly productive soils. Breakeven switchgrass prices across the three soil productivity classes ranged from $ 47 per ton in the low productivity soils to $ 76 per ton in the most productive soils. Production costs for low-profit producers were estimated at $ 47 per ton, compared to the regional average of $ 37. 50 per ton. Switchgrass production costs for the remaining <b>profitability</b> groups <b>ranged</b> from about $ 33. 50 per ton to about $ 36. 75 per ton. The breakeven farm-gate price for switchgrass ranged from $ 56 per ton for the two lowest profitability groups to over $ 94 per ton for the most profitable producers. A key economic criterion influencing the breakeven price for switchgrass will be the foregone net revenue from displaced traditional crops. On marginal soils, just under one-third of the breakeven price {{was derived from the}} level of foregone net returns from traditional crops; whereas, over 80 percent of the breakeven price was derived from the level of foregone net returns from traditional crops on the most productive soils. As net returns from traditional crops decreased the more that breakeven switchgrass prices approached production costs for switchgrass. Under current conditions of high input costs, escalating transportation costs, and given the increases in net returns from traditional crops, switchgrass, as a feedstock to a cellulosic ethanol plant, will be more expensive than previously estimated. switchgrass, production costs, farm-gate price, North Dakota, soil productivity, Agribusiness, Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R

In Kenya, this debate has focused on economies of scale and the undue influence of policy distortions on promoting the scaling up of dairy farms. This paper seeks to investigate economies of scale in Kenyan dairy in terms of relative profit efficiency at different levels of output, and identify policy and technology options to help small-scale farmers develop solutions to the challenges of competition. Data were collected from 204 dairy producers of different farm sizes in rural Kiambu and Thika, and urban Nairobi districts and a stochastic frontier model approach was used to analyze the determinants of profitability and inefficiency. Unit <b>profitability</b> per farm <b>ranged</b> between US$ 0. 13 - US$ 0. 16 per liter of milk with no significant variation across scales of farm. However, at all given levels of scale of farm, inefficiency significantly contributed to variability in profitability across farms. Scale had no significant effect on efficiency, confirming the relative competitiveness of small-scale dairy producers. Dairy farmers with commercial poultry achieved higher relative profit efficiency as poultry waste was fed to cattle. Rural location relative to Nairobi also increased efficiency. Linking rural areas and major market centre with good roads, strengthening of farmers' co-operative societies and exploring use of cheaper raw materials in the manufacture of concentrate feeds may strengthen the competitive position small dairy farms versus large ones.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{evaluate}} ORC systems and technologies from an energy and economic perspective. ORC systems are a growing renewable electricity generation technology, but New Zealand has limited local skills and expertise for identifying ORC resource opportunities and subsequently developing suitable technologies at low cost. For this reason, this thesis researches ORC technology, resource types, and international development, with the aim to determine guidelines for how to cost-effectively develop ORC systems, and to make recommendations applicable to furthering their development within a New Zealand context. This thesis first uses two surveys, one of commercial ORC installations, and a second of economic evaluations of ORC systems in literature, to determine what resources and economic scenarios are supportive of commercial development. It is found that geothermal resources provide the largest share of ORC capacity, with biomass and waste-heat recovery (WHR) being developed more recently. The surveys also found that countries with high electricity prices or policy interventions have developed {{a wider range of}} resources using ORC systems. This thesis then undertakes an EROI evaluation of ORC electricity generation systems using a combination of top-down and process based methodologies. Various heat sources; geothermal, biomass, solar, and waste heat are evaluated in order to determine how the utilised resource can affect energy <b>profitability.</b> A wide <b>range</b> of EROIstnd values, from 3. 4 – 22. 7 are found, with solar resources offering the lowest EROIs, and geothermal systems the highest. Higher still EROI values are found to be obtainable with longer system lifetimes, especially for WHR systems. Specific engineering aspects of ORC design and technology such as high-side pressure, heat storage, modularity, superheating, pinch-point temperature difference, and turbine efficiency are evaluated in terms of economic performance, and a variety of general conclusions are made about each. It is found that total system thermo-economic optimisation may not lead to the highest possible EROI, depending on the objective function. Lastly, the effects of past and potential future changes to the markets and economies surrounding ORCs are explored, including the New Zealand electricity spot price, steel and aluminium prices, subsidies, and climate policy. Of the subsidy types explored, it is found that directly subsidising ORC system capital has the greatest effect on the economic performance of ORC systems, as measured by common metrics. In conclusion, this thesis finds that ORC systems have a limited applicability to New Zealand’s electricity market under current economic conditions outside of geothermal and off-grid generation, but changes to these conditions could potentially make their development more viable. The author recommends that favourable resources should be developed using systems that provide high efficiencies, beyond what might provide the best economic performance, in order to increase EROI, and reduce the future need for costly investments into increasingly less favourable resources...|$|R
