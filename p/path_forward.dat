25|$|Prominent Guyanese {{scholar and}} {{political}} activist Walter Rodney wrote {{at length about}} the economic exploitation of Africa by the colonial powers. In particular, he saw labourers as an especially abused group. While a capitalist system almost always employs some form of wage labour, the dynamic between labourers and colonial powers left the way open for extreme misconduct. According the Rodney, African workers were more exploited than Europeans because the colonial system produced a complete monopoly on political power and left the working class small and incapable of collective action. Combined with deep-seated racism, native workers were presented with impossible circumstances. The racism and superiority felt by the colonizers enabled them to justify the systematic underpayment of Africans {{even when they were}} working alongside European workers. Colonialists further defended their disparate incomes by claiming a higher cost of living. Rodney challenged this pretext and asserted the European quality of life and cost of living were only possible because of the exploitation of the colonies and African living standards were intentionally depressed in order to maximize revenue. In its wake, colonialism left Africa vastly underdeveloped and without a <b>path</b> <b>forward.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{broadcast}} packet is for delivery to all nodes of a network. Algorithms for accomplishing this delivery through a store-and-forward packet switching computer network include (1) transmission of separately addressed packets, (2) multidestination addressing, (3) hot potato forwarding, (4) spanning tree forwarding, and (5) source based forwarding. To {{this list of}} algorithms we add (6) reverse <b>path</b> <b>forwarding,</b> a broadcast routing method which exploits routing procedures and data structures already available for packet switching. Reverse <b>path</b> <b>forwarding</b> is a practical algorithm for broadcast routing in store-and-forward packet switching computer networks. The algorithm is described as being practical {{because it is not}} optimal according to metrics developed for its analysis in this paper, and also because it can be implemented in existing networks with less complexity than that required for the known alternatives.

He decided that they would go no further north, and would head for Cape Fligely in Franz Josef Land.

500|$|The ice {{surface was}} very broken up, making travel slow and difficult. At first the parties {{were able to}} travel along a track that had been marked out by the advance parties. However, recent storms had {{destroyed}} much of the trail, and in places progress was held up by breaking ice which at one point almost wrecked Bartlett's camp as his team slept. On 28 February all the parties came together {{in front of the}} first of a series of high ridges, from [...] in height, that halted their progress. These stretched east and west, blocking any route to the island. McKinlay, Hadley and Chafe were sent on a risky journey back to Shipwreck Camp to pick up supplies that had been left there, while the rest slowly chopped and cut a pathway through the towering ridges. When McKinlay's group returned to the main party a week later, the <b>path</b> <b>forward</b> had been advanced by only three miles (5km), but the worst of the ridges had been overcome. Hadley claimed that the ridges were worse than anything he had seen in his long years of Arctic experience. The later stages of the journey were easier, as the group travelled over steadily smoother ice, and on 12 March they reached land, a long spit of sand stretching out from the northern shores of Wrangel Island.|$|E
500|$|Since Harper's {{government}} {{took office in}} 2006, Canadian greenhouse gas emissions fell from 749 to 726Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq). From 1993 until 2006, during the previous Liberal government greenhouse gas emissions increased from 600 to 749Mt of CO2 eq. The reduction corresponded Canada's decreased economic output during the Great Recession and emissions began increasing slightly in 2010, when the economy began recovering. Other significant factors in Canada's decreased emissions during Prime Minister Harper's time in office are initiatives such as the carbon tax in British Columbia, the cap and trade system in Quebec, Ontario's coal-fired power plants, and the Clean Air Regulatory Agenda which regulates emissions for automobiles and light trucks. In 2006, Canada's Clean Air and Climate Change Act was introduced to address air pollution as well as greenhouse gas emissions; it never became law. In 2006, the Clean Air Regulatory Agenda (CARA) was established to [...] "support Government of Canada efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions {{in order to improve}} the environment and health of Canadians".

40|$|Abstract — In {{an ad hoc}} network {{connection}} establishment is done to secure a path for routing packets from source to destination. This path is then maintained to secure further transmissions. In the case of Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) which are more flexible, this is not usable. Some constraints in Bluetooth demand a more flexible on-demand ad hoc network compared to other types of ad hoc network protocols. Initially we found that creating a scatternet is not practically possible using Bluetooth version 1. 1 as the slave/slave bridge is not implemented into the hardware. In this paper, we present {{a modified version of}} the Reverse <b>Path</b> <b>Forwarding</b> (RPF) algorithm to make it better suited for Bluetooth routing. The proposed Modified Reverse <b>Path</b> <b>Forwarding</b> (MRPF) algorithm allows for shorter message transfer times at the cost of additional overhead in the packets. I...|$|R

Mr. Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years by the former Government of South Africa, {{for his part in}} the struggle that would ultimately end the system of apartheid. Despite his long years of captivity, Mr. Mandela left prison with a heart closed to calls for a settling of scores. Instead, he was filled by a longing for truth and reconciliation, and for an understanding between all peoples. He demonstrated that the only <b>path</b> <b>forward</b> for the nation was to reject the appeal of bitterness. His forbearance was legendary: his magnanimity spared all South Africans incalculable suffering. Nelson Mandela's enduring legacy for his country, and the world, is the example he set through his own 'long walk to freedom.' With grace and humility, he modelled how peoples can transform their own times and in doing so, their own lives. On behalf of the Government of Canada and all Canadians, Laureen and I extend our condolences to Mr. Mandela's widow, Graça Machel, his entire family and all citizens of South Africa. Canada, a nation that granted Mr. Mandela honorary citizenship in 2001, mourns with you and the entire world today." ...|$|E
