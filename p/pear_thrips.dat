2500|$|Climate change {{appears to}} be {{affecting}} the maple sugar industry. Sugar maples {{have been subject to}} stress by acid rain, asian longhorn beetles, <b>pear</b> <b>thrips,</b> and, in 2011, an excessive deer herd that is forced to eat bark in the winter. These maples need a certain amount of cold to produce sap for maple syrup. The time to tap these trees has shrunk to one week in some years. The tree may be replaced by the more aggressive Norway maples, in effect forcing the sugar maples to [...] "migrate" [...] north to Canada.|$|E

40|$|Thrips {{have been}} {{considered}} as both target pests and control agents in biological control. The main emphasis of this paper concerns the natural enemies of thrips and an appraisal {{of the potential for}} biological control of the <b>pear</b> <b>thrips</b> on sugar maple in the northeastern United States. Previous attempts at biological control o f thrips pests have been confined t o the Caribbean and Hawaii and have made use of eulophid larval parasitoids and anthocorid predators as control agents. A review of the literature indicates that while these t w o groups often figure most strongly in natural enemy complexes of thrips, fungal pathogens are an important, if neglected, group. For biological control of <b>pear</b> <b>thrips</b> it is considered that synchronized univoltine parasitoids and fungal pathogens from Europe, the region of origin of the pest, show most promise as potential biological control agents...|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} {{effectiveness of the}} Landsat TM-derived normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) and the short-wave IR to NIR ratio (SWIR/NIR) index was examined in measurements {{of different types of}} damage in several forest communities. The forests examined included a site with well-defined fir waves in New Hampshire, a site undergoing well-documented coniferous forest decline in Vermont, and predominantly deciduous regions in Vermont and northwestern Massachusetts seriously impacted by <b>pear</b> <b>thrips.</b> Both NDVI and SWIR/NIR images were produced for each area. Results demonstrated that the SWIR/NIR index was superior to NDVI in distinguishing between high and low conifer damage at both fir-wave and forest decline sites; high and low deciduous-forest damage sites were easily separable using either NDVI or SWIR/NIR, but the NDVI was superior in separation between medium and low deciduous damage...|$|E
40|$|Mycopathogens of {{economically}} important exotic invasive {{insects in}} forests of northeastern USA {{have been the}} subject of research at the Entomology Research Laboratory, University of Vermont, for the last 20 years. Elongate hemlock scale, European fruit lecanium, hemlock woolly adelgid and <b>pear</b> <b>thrips</b> were analyzed for the presence of mycopathogens, in order to consider the potential for managing these pests with biological control. Fungal cultures isolated from insects with signs of fungal infection were identified based on morphological characters and DNA profiling. Mycopathogens recovered from infected insects were subdivided into three groups, i. e., specialized entomopathogenic; facultative entomopathogens; ubiquitous opportunistic contaminants. Epizootics were caused by fungi in the specialized group with the exception of M. microspora, P. marquandii and I. farinosa. Inoculation of insects in laboratory and field conditions with B. bassiana, L. muscarium and Myriangium sp. caused insect mortality of 45 to 95 %. Although pest populations in the field seemed severely compromised after treatment, the remnant populations re-established themselves after the winter. Although capable of inducing high mortality, a single localized aerial application of a soil-dwelling fungus does not maintain long-time suppression of pests. However, it can halt their range expansion and maintain populations below the economic threshold level without the use of expensive insecticides which have a negative impact on the environment...|$|E
