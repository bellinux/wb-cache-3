40|$|India {{houses the}} largest number of street {{children}} in the world. These children often live in abject poverty and squalid conditions. The present study aims to explore their staying preferences in the city of Surat and the reasons thereof. This cross-sectional study was conducted by interviewing 326 street children in Surat city. The study found that street children prefer to stay and work in Surat city as they perceive that Surat is a safer city; it is easier to earn money in this city; life and assimilation also is easier; there is less harassment by older children, police and others. The maximum numbers of street children are staying on the railway platforms 115 (35. 3 %). The major reasons given by the street children for choosing their <b>place</b> <b>of</b> stay are safety, convenience of finding work, comfortable shelter characteristics, availability of friends, and less harassment. There is a need to build mechanisms to increase safety of the street children at their <b>places</b> <b>of</b> stay and <b>check</b> their abuse by older children, police and authorities and encourage their stay at day care (24 hour care) centres...|$|R

The need for such an analysis arises due to the following policy proposal : the Turkish government considers increasing the lump-sum amount that drawee banks are legally responsible to pay per bad check.

We report that a percentage increase in banks' obligation per bad check could lead up to a 1. 7 % decline in the total supply <b>of</b> <b>checks</b> on the margin.

40|$|Abstract. There are {{two main}} {{shortcomings}} in the existing models for generating checking sequences based on distinguishing sequences. First, these models require a priori selection of state recognition sequences (called α-sequences) {{which may not be}} the best selection for yielding substantial reduction in the length <b>of</b> <b>checking</b> sequences. Second, they do not take advantage of overlapping to further reduce the length <b>of</b> <b>checking</b> sequences. This paper proposes an optimization model that tackles these shortcomings to reduce the lengths <b>of</b> <b>checking</b> sequences beyond what is achieved by the existing models by replacing the state recognition sequences with a set of basic sequences called α-elements and by making use of overlapping. ...|$|R
