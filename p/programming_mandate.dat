40|$|This article explores how {{a public}} service {{broadcasting}} company, namely ORF in Austria, has dealt with the challenges created by the dual system. An investigation of market requirements, public <b>programming</b> <b>mandate,</b> cost structure and financing needs reveals how economic and political constraints are interrelated. To illustrate this phenomenon, we focus on programming, specifically on the highly successful genre of popular folksy music (‘Volkstümliche Musik’). Opinions of decision-makers responsible for programming strategies at the Austrian PSB company are linked with a detailed empirical analysis of one prosperous production within that genre. This enables us to draw a number of conclusions on the strategies pursued by public service broadcasting companies to master the changed market conditions and draw attention to so far unattended topics. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{explores the}} role of international standards in the rules governing the internationalisation of the service economy. It analyses on a cross-institutional basis patterns of authority in the institutional setting of service standards in the European and Amercian context. The entry into force of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 1995 gave international standards {{a major role in}} harmonising the technical specifications of goods and services traded on the global market Despite the careful wording of the WTO, a whole range of international bodies still have the capacity to define generic as well as detailed technical specifications affecting how swelling offshore services are expected to be traded on worldwide basis. The analysis relies on global political economy approaches to identify constitutive patterns of authority mediating between the political and the economic spheres on a transnational space. It extends to the area of service standards the assumption that the process of globalisation is not opposing states and markets, but a joint expression of both of them including new patterns and agents of structural change through formal and informal power and regulatory practices. The paper argues that service standards reflect the significant development of a form of transnational hybrid authority, that blurs the distinction between private and public actors, whose scope spread all along from physical measures to societal values, and which reinforces the deterritorialisation of regulatory practices in contemporary capitalism. It provides evidence of this argument by analysing the current European strategy regarding service standardization in response to several <b>programming</b> <b>mandate</b> of the European Commission and the American views on the future development of service standards...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to {{provide an overview of}} standards in video surveillance, including the need for standards, an overview of existing relevant standardisation efforts including gaps, and a roadmap for future standards development. The first part of the document identifies the need for standardization. The <b>programming</b> <b>mandate</b> M/ 487 issued by the EC to standards bodies in 2011 to study existing standards in the security domain, to establish gaps, and to propose a standardization work programme, did not directly address video analytics or video surveillance in its remit, hence these areas remain weakly addressed. The report provides a case study on post-event investigative video analysis illustrating the requirements for such standards, especially on interoperability aspects. The report then details standard development organizations relevant to surveillance, including an overview of their work. This includes interface standards organizations, working groups and technical committees, and relevant ISO/IEC standards including on alarm systems, multimedia, forensics, video surveillance, and risk analysis. Standardization also covers benchmarking activities, whose aim is to effectively assess the performance of algorithms and systems in order to attain robustness under varying conditions. The history of relevant initiatives is provided in this report, including details on specific programmes, projects, and methodology. Prior work on certification on video surveillance systems is also described. The report then details a gap analysis of standards in video surveillance. This includes lack of standards at different levels of interoperability, lack of a universally agreed set of performance evaluation benchmarking metrics for video analytics, and the lack of European level certification for surveillance systems or its components. Finally, the report makes a number of recommendations for video surveillance standards. This includes new work items to (1) develop one or more EU standards for surveillance of critical infrastructure, and (2) to develop a harmonized certification procedure for video surveillance systems and components for protection of critical infrastructure at EU level.
