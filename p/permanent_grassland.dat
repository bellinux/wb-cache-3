40|$|Abstract: The {{importance}} of <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> in Romania has been minimised these last years by both {{turning them into}} arable lands or by abandoning them. The goal {{of this paper is}} to characterise from an ecological point of view and from the point of view of fodder yield some <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> in different states of management with a view to establish some corrective measures. The vegetation of the <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> was analysed in 2011, with measurements made in the last decade of April, in the middle of the second decade of June, and in the second decade of September. <b>Permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> are located in the southern part of the Timis County, following the line of the localities Dudestii Noi – Cenad. Data processing was done based on botanical sampling. Vegetation determination was done with the linear method (quadrant) calculating pastoral value (PV). Alpha-biodiversity was estimated with the Shannon (H') and Simpson (D) indices, while beta-diversity was estimated with the Jaccard index (Pj) and with the Hamming (H) distance. Irrational use of <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> and the lack of proper improvement measures have lead to the present state of the vegetal cover.

40|$|International audienceThe {{key role}} of <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> for the {{conservation}} of biodiversity, and more generally for the preservation of environment quality, is clearly established.

40|$|Research has {{delivered}} convincing {{findings on the}} effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and humankind. Indeed, ecosystems provide provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural services. The global value of annual ecosystem services of grasslands and rangelands is about US$ 232 ha− 1 year− 1. Nevertheless, the precise evaluation of biodiversity benefits remains challenging. This issue is due to valuation methods, subjective assumptions, and complexity of drivers of plant community dynamics. Here, we review the primary factors that influence plant diversity of <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands,</b> and we describe underlying processes. These factors must indeed be identified to focus policies meant to preserve and restore plant diversity and to advise farmers about efficient decision rules. We show that plant dynamics of <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> cannot be explained simply by agricultural management rules, e. g., grazing, fertilization, and mowing, implemented at the field scale. The configuration of the surrounding landscape, e. g., landscape heterogeneity, habitat fragmentation, and connectivity, acts as a species filter that defines the regional species pool and controls seed flow. The regional species pool often contains higher species richness in a heterogeneous landscape, because of a higher diversity of suitable habitats. This regional pool could be a major species sources for <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> according to the seed flow. We discuss the need to consider all of these factors to understand plant species composition of <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> and the necessity to study plant communities using both taxonomic and functional approaches. In order to report this integrative approach, we propose a conceptual model based on three ecological challenges—dispersal, establishment, and persistence—that are considered to act as filters on plant diversity, and a graphical representation of the complexity of such studies due to the interaction effects between plant dispersal abilities, forage productivity, disturbances induced by farming practices, and landscape heterogeneity on plant diversity.

However, the numbers of endogeic species was found higher in grasslands than in agricultural land. Particularly in grasslands, the correlation between earthworm characteristics (earthworm density and distribution) and soil physico-chemical properties {{was not so much}} (Table  4). These are usually much abundant in grassland in comparison with in agricultural land, which is probably due to number of factors among which lesser availability of food and regular soil tillage in agricultural lands {{may be the most important}} causes (e.g., Barley, 1961; Boag, Palmer, Neilson, Legg, & Chambers, 1997; Edwards & Bohlen, 1996; Edwards & Lofty, 1979; Evans & Guild, 1948; Tischler, 1955; Zicsi, 1969) An exception to this is the position of the abundance of epigeic species, located close to that of Lumbricus rubellus, reflecting the dominance of this species in this ecological group. This may be regarded as an indication that the management type is important in determining the abundance in which earthworm populations occur. In particular, the higher amount of soil organic matter in grassland farms, and the less intensive soil cultivation may be decisive in this respect. The porosity of the upper layers decreased when the land used for pasturage particularly.|$|R

40|$|Insight {{is needed}} into how {{management}} influences soil biota when sustainable grassland systems are developed. A crop rotation {{of grass and}} maize can be sustainable in terms of efficient nutrient use. However, there is lack {{of information on the}} effect of such a crop rotation on soil biological quality. Earthworms, nematodes, bacteria and fungi were sampled over three years in a 36 years old experiment. Permanent arable land was compared with <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> and with a ley-arable crop rotation. In the rotation, a period of three years of grassland (temporary grassland) was followed by a period of three years of arable land (temporary arable land) and vice versa. In the first year of arable cropping in the rotation, the number of earthworms was already low and not different from continuous cropping. In the three-year grass ley, the abundance of earthworms returned to the level of <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> in the second year. However, the restoration of earthworm biomass took a minimum of three years. Furthermore, the anecic species did not recover the dominance they had in the <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland.</b> The numbers of herbivorous and microbivorous nematodes in the ley-crop rotation reached similar levels to those in the permanent treatments within one to two years. Although the same holds for the nematode genera composition, the Maturity Index and the proportion of omnivorous nematodes in the temporary treatments remained significantly lower than in their permanent counterparts. Differences in recovery were also found among microbial parameters. In the temporary treatments, bacterial growth rate and the capacity to degrade a suite of substrates recovered in the second year. However, the Community-Level Physiological Profiles in the <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> remained different from the other treatments. Our results suggest that many functions of soil biota that are well established in <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland,</b> are restored in a ley-arable crop rotation. However, due to a reduction in certain species, specific functions of these soil biota could be reduced or lost. The ley-arable crop rotations were intermediate to <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> and continuous arable land in terms of functioning of soil biota (e. g., N-mineralization). In terms of the functional aspects of the soil biota, <b>permanent</b> <b>grassland</b> might be preferable wherever possible.

Understanding leaf trait variation along environmental gradients is thus {{essential to}} improve the representation of vegetation in Earth system models. Our aims were to quantify relationships between leaf traits and climate in <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> at a biogeographical scale and to test whether these relationships were sensitive to (a) the level of nitrogen inputs and (b) the inclusion of information pertaining to plant community organization. Location <b>Permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> throughout France. Methods We combined existing datasets on climate, soil, nitrogen inputs (fertilization and deposition), species composition and four traits, namely specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content and leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, for 15, 865 French <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands.</b> Trait–climate relationships were tested using the following four climatic variables available across 1, 833 pixels (5 km × 5 km) : mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP), and two indices accounting {{for the length of}} the growing season. We compared these relationships at the pixel level using either using community-level or species’ trait means. Results Our findings were as follows: (a) leaf traits related to plant nutrient economy shift consistently along a gradient of growing season length accounting for temperature and soil water limitations of plant growth (GSLtw); (b) weighting leaf traits by species abundance in local communities is pivotal to capture leaf trait–environment relationships correctly at a biogeographical scale; and (c) the relationships between traits and GSLtw weaken for grasslands with a high nitrogen input. Main conclusions The effects of climate on plant communities are better described using composite descriptors than coarse variables such as MAT or MAP, but appear weaker for high-nitrogen grasslands. Using information at the community level tends to strengthen trait–climate relationships. The interplay of land management, community assembly and bioclimate appears crucial to the prediction of leaf trait variations and their effects on biogeochemical cycles...|$|R
