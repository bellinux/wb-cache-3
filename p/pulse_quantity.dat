40|$|A single fuel {{injection}} pulse can be split into smaller pulses for optimizing the engine performance. In every injected pulse, the engine requires a specific quantity of fuel which is {{decided by the}} Engine Control Module (ECM). The quantity of fuel injected {{is critical to the}} performance of the engine. A technique to assess and compensate for fueling errors and variability in the injected fuel quantity estimation is of great interest. The current study is intended to identify the critical parameters that cause variability in the injected <b>pulse</b> <b>quantity</b> and devise suitable control strategies to control those parameters to enhance the accuracy of the fuel delivered in every shot during injection. The focus here is on the Cummins Inc. Heavy Duty XPI injector configured to run a small pilot and a large main pulse. The work involves using an injector model in the Gamma Technologies suite (GT Fuel). The model was validated for single pulse injection. ^ Since multiple pulse injection has timing issues very different from the single pulse injection, this work involves generating a new critical parameter tree for multiple pulse injection. From the Critical Parameter Flow Down, body pressure dynamics were identified as the primary cause of the variability in fueling. There is a pressure wave set up inside the injector body due to the first injection pulse. When the second pulse is fired, the pressure in the injector body is fluctuating. The condition at which the second pulse is fired depends upon the spacing between pulses and the quantity injected in the first pulse. Since body pressure is critical, a simple model to estimate the body pressure trace across an injection event has been developed. The simple model results are compared with the results from GT Fuel. Good agreement is found between the simple model results and the GT Fuel Model. ^ To pinpoint the focus of the fueling error, the injection rate shapes for the multipulse cases were analyzed in comparison with the single pulse case with matching conditions. The opening portion of the injection rate shape was identified as the major contributor to the fueling error. The start of the second pulse shifts owing to the preceding pulse and the opening slope of the rate shape changes as well. An approximation to quantify this error using rate shape parameters has been devised. This approximation captures about 70 % of the total fueling error. To use this approximation, the rate shape parameters need to be estimated. Since these parameters depend upon the system dynamics, correlation with the body pressure parameters was sought. Regression models were used to estimate the dominant rate shape parameters influencing fueling. The predictor variables in the regression models are the body pressure parameters. The opening slope is estimated within an error of 5 % while the shift in the start of injection is estimated within 15 %. Thus, the body pressure is initially estimated, and using the parameters of the body pressure in the regression equations, the rate shape parameters are estimated. This results in the estimation of the fueling error. ^ A simple technique to correct for the error in fueling is to alter the on-time of the injector. A scheme for correcting the on-time is also described. This scheme is specific for the injector and the information to correct for the on-time is obtained from the Fueling-On-time Curve drawn up for a particular injector. This estimation-correction scheme can reduce the fueling variation by about 40 % on average. ^ This thesis provides insight into the functioning and the underlying aspects of multipulse injection in solenoid operated diesel fuel injectors. A scheme to correct this error is described which is proposed to work satisfactorily in steady state engine operating conditions. ...|$|E

We compare the performance of these automated methods with manually detected HFO ripples by a trained EEG analyst and explore their potential diagnostic relevance.

40|$|Abstract A {{method is}} {{described}} for quantitatively identifying ground motions containing strong velocity pulses, {{such as those}} caused by near-fault directivity. The approach uses wavelet analysis to extract the largest velocity pulse from a given ground motion. The size of the extracted pulse relative to the original ground motion is used to develop a quantitative criterion for classifying a ground motion as “pulse-like. ” The criterion is calibrated by using a training data set of manually classified ground motions. To identify the subset of these pulselike records of greatest engi-neering interest, two additional criteria are applied: the pulse arrives early in the ground motion and the absolute amplitude of the velocity pulse is large. The period of the velocity <b>pulse</b> (a <b>quantity</b> of interest to engineers) is easily determined {{as part of the}} procedure, using the pseudoperiods of the basis wavelets. This classification approach is useful for a variety of seismology and engineering topics where pulselike ground motions are of interest, such as probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, ground-motion prediction (“attenuation”) models, and nonlinear dynamic analysis of struc-tures. The Next Generation Attenuation (NGA) project ground motion library was processed using this approach, and 91 large-velocity pulses were found in the fault-normal components of the approximately 3500 strong ground motion recordings considered. It is believed that many of the identified pulses are caused by near-fault directivity effects. The procedure {{can be used as a}} stand-alone classification criterion or as a filter to identify ground motions deserving more careful study...|$|R
40|$|Improving {{tradeoffs}} between noise, fuel consumption, {{and emissions}} in future internal combustion engines {{will require the}} development of increasingly flexible fuel injection systems which can deliver more complex injection profiles. Piezoelectric injectors {{have the ability to}} deliver multiple, tightly spaced injections in each cycle and continuously variable injection called “rate shaping,” but are highly dynamic systems requiring careful voltage input modulation to achieve sophisticated flow profiles. Closed-loop control could prove to be a key enabler for this technology, but will require on-line estimation of the injected fuel flow rate to be realized because of the inability to measure injector flow rate on an actual engine. ^ This work outlines the development of an 11 state simulation model for a piezoelectric fuel injector and associated driver {{that can be used for}} injector design and control system verification. Non-measureable states of the model are plotted and analyzed, while measurable quantities including injection rate, piezo stack voltage, and piezo stack current are validated against experimental injector rig data for two different rail pressures. ^ This thesis also describes the development of a physics based fuel flow estimator which can be used as feedback to a closed-loop controller. Available measurements of piezo stack voltage and rail-to-injector line pressure are used for dynamic state estimation. Estimator results are compared against both open-loop simulation and experimental data for a variety of profiles at different rail pressures, and show improvement, particularly for more complex multi-pulse profiles. Also the error seen in the simulated injected fuel quantity is generally reduced by over 50 % with the estimator for almost every pulse. Internal states of the estimator are used to evaluate pulse-to-pulse interaction phenomena that make control of multi-pulse profiles difficult to achieve. A hypothesis for pulse-to-pulse interaction is illustrated by dividing the needle lift vs. fuel flow resistance relationship into regimes, and correlating the pulse-to-pulse behavior to the regime switching that occurs for tightly spaced pulses. ^ Finally, this work summarizes the use of estimation algorithms for cycle-to-cycle determination of an injection flow profile capable of being used as feedback for a closed-loop control algorithm. While the estimation equations are complex and require a small time step, a strategy is proposed which captures important estimation feedback during the injection period and delays the integration of state variables across the engine cycle to more efficiently utilize a real-time processor. Lastly, a simplified model is developed to represent the dynamics of simultaneously controlling the <b>quantity</b> of <b>pulses</b> as well as the realized dwell time in between pulses. The model accounts for the coupling between the two, and a control law is developed and refined to provide an overdamped response of both the <b>pulse</b> <b>quantities</b> and realized dwell time, in order to prevent pulse bleeding. Transient response of the controller is shown in simulation and validated against experimental data with good correlation. ^ Overall, this thesis describes a generalizable method to produce cycle-to-cycle virtual measurements of fuel injection for the purpose of subsequent controller design, which could provide a platform for making substantial improvements in combustion related efficiency and emissions by increasing the flexibility of the fuel injection system. ...|$|R

In estuarine systems, riverine flood <b>pulses</b> deliver large <b>quantities</b> of basal resources and make high quality habitat available for exploitation by consumers. These consumers represent a change in resources that may be available for trophic transfer. We quantified this increased consumer resource availability (nekton density, biomass, energy density) provided by riverine flood pulsing in Breton Sound, Louisiana, USA. We used water level differences between an area subject to two experimental riverine flood pulses (inflow) and a reference area not receiving inflow to identify the percentage of nekton standing stock and energy density that may be attributable solely to riverine pulsing and may represent a consumer resource subsidy.

The experimental data were acquired for six key-points representative of the engine working conditions over a NEDC (New European Driving Cycle). The experimental tests have been carried out according to the Design of Experiment approach and for each point several variation lists of the main engine variables have been considered. As a first step, the main engine variables which are expected to be related to the formation and oxidation of PM have been identified. An exponential mathematical model has then been introduced and a detailed statistical analysis has been carried out for each key-point in order to identify the most robust combination of the input variables among all the possible ones. It was verified that PM emissions are correlated to a great extent to the value of the chemical heat release at the end of the injection of the main <b>pulse.</b> This <b>quantity</b> is in fact related to the mass of burned gases which is generated by the oxidation of the pilot pulses that precede the main injection.

We study the effect of a preionizing pulse on the efficiency of plasma generation by a second “probe” pulse and demonstrate that preionization results into a considerable increase of the overall photon yield emitted by the plasma. An explanation of this phenomenon relies {{on the fact that the}} larger the electron density experienced by the probe pulse, the more effective the energy transfer from the probe pulse to the residual plasma, the more intense is the light from the plasma. With this concept in mind and by relying on a pump-probe technique, we also measure the total photon yield emitted by the plasma produced by the combination of the two pulses, as a function of their relative delay time. We observe a considerable increase in the plasma brightness for delay times much longer than the laser pulse duration. This phenomenon is associated with an increase of the electron density even after the end of the pump pulse, due to secondary electron-impact ionization originating from highly-energetic primary photoelectrons, and to superelastic electron-molecule collisions. We also develop a simplified model describing the time evolution of the electron and ion densities and the electron temperature.

Assuming surface intensity maps with one and two hotspots, we compute theoretically the periodic modulation of the mean flux, pulsephase residuals and fractional amplitudes {{of the first and}} second harmonic of the <b>pulse</b> profiles. These <b>quantities</b> are characterised in terms of their relative precession phase offsets. We then search for these signatures in 37 days of X-ray timing data from the accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J 1814 − 338. We analyse a 12. 2 -d modulation observed previously and show that it is consistent with a freely precessing neutron star only if the inclination angle is < 0. 1 ◦, an a priori unlikely orientation. We conclude that if the observed flux variations are due to precession, our model incompletely describes the relative precession phase offsets (e. g. the surface intensity map is over-simplified). We are still able to place an upper limit on ǫ of 3. 0 × 10 − 9 independently of our model, and estimate the phase-independent tilt angle θ to lie roughly between 5 ◦ and 10 ◦. On the other hand, if the observed flux variations are not due to precession, the detected signal serves as a firm upper limit for any underlying precession signal. We then place an upper limit on the product ǫ cosθ of � 9. 9 × 10 − 10.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{evolution}} of intermediate mass (M. ge. 5 Mo) zero metal (Z= 0) stars with {{particular attention to the}} AGB phase. At variance with previous claims we find that these stars experience thermal instability (the so called thermal <b>pulses).</b> The critical <b>quantity</b> which controls the onset of a thermally pulsing phase is the amount of CNO in the envelope during the AGB. For these stars the central He burning starts in the blue side of the HR diagram and the 1 ^{st} dredge up does not take place. Then the envelope maintains its initial composition up {{to the beginning of the}} AGB phase. However, during the early AGB the 2 ^{nd} dredge-up occurs and fresh He and CNO elements are engulfed in the convective envelope. We find that in stars with M. ge. 6 Mo the resulting amount of ^{ 12 }C is large enough to sustain a normal CNO burning within the H shell and consequently the star enters the usual thermal pulse phase. In the 5 Mo model, owing to the lower ^{ 12 }C enhancement in the envelope after the 2 ^{nd} dredge-up, the He burning shell suffers weak thermal instabilities. 9 of these thermal oscillation are needed before the He burning luminosity reaches 3 x 10 ^ 5 Lo and a first convective shell develops in between the two burning shells. Later on a second convective shell forms at the base of the H rich envelope. This convective zone cross the H/He discontinuity and partially overlaps the previous one, dredging up fresh ^{ 12 }C. After a huge H flash, a quiescent CNO burning settle on. From this moment a thermal pulse phase starts, which is very similar to the one experienced by the more massive models.

40|$|Understanding the {{evolution}} of shallow magma plumbing systems at short-lived, basaltic volcanoes such as Sinker Butte, in the western Snake River Plain of Idaho, gives insight into the potential behavior and hazards at current and future volcanic centers. Its extensive outcrops are conducive to examining how the lava flows and tephra units shaped the magma plumbing system of the volcano. Fifteen dikes and several additional intrusive sheets are exposed around the eastern and southern sides of Sinker Butte. Twelve of the dikes are oriented in a radial pattern around the capping mesa that is interpreted {{to have been a}} lava lake within the tuff cone 2 ̆ 7 s crater. This pattern is indicative of outward extrusion from one or more central magma chambers. The dikes are exposed for up to 450 m along strike and are between 28 and 133 cm in width. All of the dikes and lava flows at Sinker Butte are tholeiitic and contain phenocrysts of plagioclase and olivine. The asymmetrical patterns of a few suggest that they had enough time to solidify before another magma pulse intruded. Most of the dikes have symmetrical patterns of vesicles and phenocrysts across their widths, indicative of a single continuous magma <b>pulse.</b> Greater <b>quantities</b> of phenocrysts in the dike interiors suggest the grains were concentrated by flow differentiation. Chemical differences in the dikes mostly result from the modal percentages of phenocrysts in a sample. Samples with more phenocrysts contain more of the elements included in plagioclase and olivine. Subsequently, specimens with higher total phenocryst contents have lower concentrations of elements excluded from both minerals. The magma that formed dikes J, M, and N has a different magmatic history than that of the other dikes, because they have unique excluded trace element ratios. These dikes are also distinguished from the others by geographic region and relation to sills. Dikes J, M, and N do not continue stratigraphically below the sills they merge with indicating that either the dikes fed the sills or visa-versa. The preferred intrusion hypothesis for the remaining radial dikes is based on flow directions derived by anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility analyses. Flow directions within the dikes indicate sources at various depths beneath the lava lake at the summit of the volcano. It is assumed that the lava lake existed prior to dike propagation and had crystallized to the point that magma could no longer be extruded. Mounting pressure caused fractures to radiate from several places along the vertical central magma conduit that had fed the lava lake, filling with magma. As dike propagation continued, the tops of the dikes eventually reached the surface causing flank eruptions and the bench lava flows. The breakout point at the distal end of Dike D was likely formed in this manner. Once the source of the magma was tapped, gravity would have caused the final flow directions within the dikes to tilt downward, especially in the sections directly beneath the lava flows. This is confirmed by the steep maximum AMS axes inclinations at the drill sites closest to the bench basalts. Also, cavities were found where the tops of dikes K and G meet the bench basalts...|$|R
40|$|Recentemente, cadeias granulares afiladas tem sido objeto de estudo para o desenvolvimento de dispositivos absorvedores de impacto (ondas de choque). A caracter&# 305;stica deste sistema em atenuar ondas de choque (pulsos de momento linear), torna este {{material}} um excelente candidato para tais absorvedores. Assim, vários estudos neste sentido foram realizados, por´em a maioria são de caráter numérico e, alguns, anal´&# 305;ticos. Todavia, as aproximaçoes anal&# 305;ticas apresentadas não demonstram bons ajustes com soluções numericas. Neste trabalho estudamos analiticamente a propagação do momento linear e energia cinetica em cadeias afiladas unidimensionais de graos esfericos que interagem segundo o potencial de Hertz. Aplicamos a aproximaçao binaria, baseada na suposiçao que a energia transferida ao longo da cadeia ocorre atraves {{de colis}} oes sucessivas entre duas part´&# 305;culas. Estudamos quatro configuraçoes de afilamento: linear para frente, exponencial para frente, linear para tras e exponencial para tras. Com a Teoria Binaria, prevemos corretamente as tendencias de aumento e diminuiçao das propagaçoes do momento linear e energia cinetica. Contudo, para capturarmos os valores corretos das amplitudes dos pulsos dessas grandezas desenvolvemos uma correçao numerico-anal&# 305;tica para as velocidades das part&# 305;culas. Confrontamos os resultados com soluçoes numericas das equaçoes de movimento, onde utilizamos o metodo de Runge-Kutta de quarta ordem. Os resultados demonstram: bom acordo entre as teorias anal&# 305;tica e numerica; as cadeias afiladas exponencialmente para frente são as mais indicadas nos projetos de absorvedores (apresentam decaimento exponencial do momento linear); um cen´ario mais fraco para a propagação da energia cinetica (devido a dependencia quadratica com a velocidade), porem o momento linear e a grandeza relevante no contexto de impactos. Alem disso, obtivemos bom acordo com resultados experimentais apresentados por F. Melo e colaboradores (2006). Dessa forma, apresentamos expressoes anal&# 305;ticas que capturam corretamente as propagaçoes de momento linear e energia cinetica em cadeias granulares afiladas. Estes sistemas, realmente demonstram serem excelentes para absorver ondas de choque, atenuando pulsos de momento linear e saturando pulsos de energia cin´etica. Uma extensao deste trabalho sera estudar cadeias decoradas afiladas com pre-compressao, que permitem a absorçao de ondas de choque com numero menor de graos nas cadeias (cadeias curtas). Recently, tapered granular chains {{have been studied}} {{for the development of}} impact-absorbing devices (shock waves). The characteristic of this system to mitigate shock waves (pulses of linear momentum), makes this material an excellent candidate for such absorbers. Therefore, many studies have been conducted in this direction, but most are numeric character, and some analytical. However, the analytical approximations presented do not show good fits with numerical solutions. In this work we study analytically the propagation of linear momentum and kinetic energy in one-dimensional tapered chains of spherical grains that interact according to the Hertz potential. We apply the binary approximation, based on the supposition that the energy transferred along the chain occurs through successive collisions between two particles. Four settings taper were studied: forward linear, forward exponential, backward linear and backward exponential. With the Binary Theory, we correctly anticipate the trends of increase and decrease the propagation of linear momentum and kinetic energy. However, to capture the correct values of the amplitudes of the <b>pulses</b> of these <b>quantities</b> we developed a numericalanalytic correction to the velocities of particles. Compared the results with numerical solutions of the equations of motion, where we use the Runge-Kutta fourth order. The results show: good agreement between the analytical and numerical theories; forward exponentially tapered chains are the most suitable in the design of absorbers (present exponential decay of linear momentum); a weaker scenario for the propagation of kinetic energy (due to quadratic dependence with the velocity), but the linear momentum is the quantity relevant in the context of impacts. Furthermore, we found good agreement with experimental results presented by F. Melo et al (2006). Thus, we present analytical expressions that capture correctly the propagation of linear momentum and kinetic energy in tapered granular chains. These systems actually demonstrate be excellent for absorbing shock waves, attenuating pulses of linear momentum and saturating kinetic energy. An extension of this work is to study tapered decorated chains and with precompression, allowing the absorption in chains composed of a number smaller grains (short chains) ...|$|R
