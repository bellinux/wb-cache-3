5|$|Electric cars, {{as well as}} plug-in hybrids {{operating}} in all-electric mode, emit no harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard source of power, such as particulates (soot), volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, and various oxides of nitrogen. The clean air benefit is usually local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, air <b>pollutant</b> <b>emissions</b> are shifted to the location of the generation plants. In a similar manner, plug-in electric vehicles {{operating in}} all-electric mode do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power, but {{from the point of view}} of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. This fact has been referred to as the long tailpipe of plug-in electric vehicles. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles and higher than hybrid electric vehicles. In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine, tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy.|$|E

The use of new buses along dedicated busways has decreased pollutants as there is less idling time.

25|$|An {{alternative}} approach of using coal for electricity generation with improved efficiency is the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant. Instead of pulverizing the coal and burning it directly as fuel in the steam-generating boiler, the coal is gasified (see coal gasification) to create syngas, which is burned in a gas turbine to produce electricity (just like {{natural gas is}} burned in a turbine). Hot exhaust gases from the turbine are used to raise steam in a {{heat recovery steam generator}} which powers a supplemental steam turbine. Thermal efficiencies of current IGCC power plants range from 39% to 42% (HHV basis) or ≈42–45% (LHV basis) for bituminous coal and assuming utilization of mainstream gasification technologies (Shell, GE Gasifier, CB). IGCC power plants outperform conventional pulverized coal-fueled plants in terms of <b>pollutant</b> <b>emissions,</b> and allow for relatively easy carbon capture.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the issue of}} air <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> for the optimal and sustainable determination of cordon location, toll level, and price of park and ride (P&R). Although air <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> decreases within the cordon by the implementation of cordon pricing scheme, it may increase outside the cordon and the whole network. Hence, air <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> may only transfer from inside of the cordon to its outside. Therefore, in this paper, a multi-objective bi-level optimization model is developed. A solution algorithm is also presented based on the second version of strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA 2). The results reveal that this multi-objective model can be {{a useful tool for}} the sustainable and optimal design of the cordon and P&R scheme. In addition, cordon pricing is a multi-objective problem. Therefore, it is necessary to consider air <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission.</b> By choosing another non-dominated result in the solution space, air <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> outside the cordon and the whole network can be reduced without a significant reduction in social welfare...|$|R

25|$|The {{effect of}} PHEVs on {{greenhouse}} emissions is complex. Plug-in hybrid vehicles operating on all-electric mode do not emit harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard source of power. The clean air benefit is usually local because {{depending on the}} source of the electricity used to recharge the batteries, air <b>pollutant</b> <b>emissions</b> are shifted to the location of the generation plants. In the same way, PHEVs do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power, but {{from the point of view}} of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles.

25|$|A {{street network}} pattern {{can affect the}} {{production}} of pollutants {{by the amount of}} car travel that it necessitates and the speed at which cars can travel. The grid plan with its frequent intersections may displace a portion of the local car trips with walking or biking due to the directness of route that it offers to pedestrians. But it also makes the same routes more direct for cars, which could be an enticement for driving. The potential car trip displacement would result in a reduction of <b>pollutant</b> <b>emissions.</b> The advantage of the intersection density for pedestrians, however, can have a contrary effect for cars due to its potential for reducing speeds. Low speeds below 20 mph have a significantly higher coefficient of pollutant production than above 30, though the coefficient after leveling off tends to increase gradually after 50 mph. This effect is accentuated with high traffic density in areas with commercial uses where speeds come to a crawl. Since the grid plan is non-hierarchical and intersections are frequent, all streets can be subject to this potential reduction of average speeds, leading to a high production of pollutants. Greenhouse and noxious gases can be detrimental to the environment and to resident health.|$|E
500|$|Norway {{pioneered the}} {{implementation}} of electronic urban tolling in the main corridors of Norway's three major cities: Bergen (1986), Oslo (1990), and Trondheim (1991). In Bergen cars can only enter the central area using a toll road, so that the effect {{is similar to a}} congestion charge. Though initially intended only to raise revenues to finance road infrastructure, the urban toll ring at Oslo created an unintended congestion pricing effect, as traffic decreased by around 5%. The Trondheim Toll Scheme also has congestion pricing effects, as charges vary by time of day. The Norwegian authorities pursued authorization to implement congestion charges in cities, and legislation was approved by Parliament in 2001. In October 2011 the Norwegian government announced the introduction of rules allowing congestion charging in cities. The measure is intended to [...] cut greenhouse gas and air <b>pollutant</b> <b>emissions,</b> and relief traffic congestion. , Norwegian authorities have implemented urban charging schemes that operates both on the motorways and for access into downtown areas in five additional cities or municipalities: Haugesund, Kristiansand, Namsos, Stavanger, and Tonsberg.|$|E

500|$|The {{technical}} {{literature on}} air pollution dispersion is quite extensive and {{dates back to}} the 1930s and earlier. One of the early air pollutant plume dispersion equations was derived by Bosanquet and Pearson. Their equation did not assume Gaussian distribution nor did it include the effect of ground reflection of the pollutant plume. [...] Sir Graham Sutton derived an air pollutant plume dispersion equation in 1947 which did include the assumption of Gaussian distribution for the vertical and crosswind dispersion of the plume and also included the effect of ground reflection of the plume. [...] Under the stimulus provided by the advent of stringent environmental control regulations, there was an immense growth in the use of air pollutant plume dispersion calculations between the late 1960s and today. A great many computer programs for calculating the dispersion of air <b>pollutant</b> <b>emissions</b> were developed {{during that period of time}} and they were called [...] "air dispersion models". The basis for most of those models was the Complete Equation For Gaussian Dispersion Modeling Of Continuous, Buoyant Air Pollution Plumes [...] The Gaussian air pollutant dispersion equation requires the input of H which is the pollutant plume's centerline height above ground level—and H is the sum of Hs (the actual physical height of the pollutant plume's emission source point) plus ΔH (the plume rise due the plume's buoyancy).|$|E
500|$|Since Harper's {{government}} {{took office in}} 2006, Canadian greenhouse gas emissions fell from 749 to 726Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq). From 1993 until 2006, during the previous Liberal government greenhouse gas emissions increased from 600 to 749Mt of CO2 eq. The reduction corresponded Canada's decreased economic output during the Great Recession and emissions began increasing slightly in 2010, when the economy began recovering. Other significant factors in Canada's decreased emissions during Prime Minister Harper's time in office are initiatives such as the carbon tax in British Columbia, the cap and trade system in Quebec, Ontario's coal-fired power plants, and the Clean Air Regulatory Agenda which regulates emissions for automobiles and light trucks. In 2006, Canada's Clean Air and Climate Change Act was introduced to address air pollution as well as greenhouse gas emissions; it never became law. In 2006, the Clean Air Regulatory Agenda (CARA) was established to [...] "support Government of Canada efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) and air <b>pollutant</b> <b>emissions</b> {{in order to improve}} the environment and health of Canadians". In December 2011, the Harper administration announced that Canada would formally withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol.

2500|$|... "Clean" [...] coal {{technology}} {{is a collection of}} technologies being developed to mitigate the environmental impact of coal energy generation. Those technologies are being developed to remove or reduce <b>pollutant</b> <b>emissions</b> to the atmosphere. Some of the techniques that would be used to accomplish this include chemically washing minerals and impurities from the coal, gasification (see also IGCC), improved technology for treating flue gases to remove pollutants to increasingly stringent levels and at higher efficiency, carbon capture and storage technologies to capture the carbon dioxide from the flue gas and dewatering lower rank coals (brown coals) to improve the calorific value, and thus the efficiency of the conversion into electricity. Figures from the United States Environmental Protection Agency show that these technologies have made today's coal-based generating fleet 77 percent cleaner on the basis of regulated emissions per unit of energy produced.|$|E

30|$|Compared the {{contribution}} of various electricity generation technologies to the medium power demand, it presents that different electricity conversion technologies have various generation quantities under changed pollutants emission- cutting scenarios. As the above analysis, in the respect of energy type, coal-fired electricity would be the mainly power supply source under 0 % <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> reduction. Natural gas-fired electricity conversion technology would {{play a key role}} in the power generation activities, coal-fired power would be in a second place and wind power would be the supplement under 10 % and 20 % <b>pollutants</b> <b>emissions</b> reduction. This is because coal-fired electricity conversion technology has comparatively low operating and penalty costs and relatively low capital cost for capacity expansion, and the related cost of natural gas-fired electricity conversion technology is a little higher than coal-fired power and the <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> from natural gas-fired power generation process is smaller relatively. The maximum optimized wind power generation would be 0.5 GWh in April, July and October, due to the relatively higher operating cost and capital cost for its storage, which limits the development of wind power. The dominant role of coal-fired electricity would be displaced by some other conversion technologies with an increased demand for <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> reduction. For example, under 20 % <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> reduction, the optimized coal-fired power target would decrease to [39.94, 46.20] GWh in January; although fuel-fired power would decrease, the optimized targets of wind power would have a growth and play an important role to meet electricity demand. It indicates that environment-friendly electricity conversion technologies should better serve interests of the <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> reduction and be chosen for power generation to meet the ever-increasing electricity demands and gradually enhancing <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> reduction requirements. These are optimized conclusions in terms of pollutants emission-cutting; from view point of energy saving, CHP would be properly adopted in electricity and heat generation progress.|$|R

30|$|From {{the above}} analysis, we can {{conclude}} that the solutions worked out from the ITSDP are value for making decisions of energy resources allocation, capacity expansion of power and heat generation as well as <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> management.

Cost-effective options can be obtained with a least-cost strategy though planning <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> management in regional electricity and heat supply. However, if <b>pollutants</b> <b>emission</b> reduction is considered, the pre-regulated targets of electricity and heat supply from various technologies have to be reallocated, the pre-arranged capacity expansion options of power and heat generation technologies would be reselected.|$|R
