50|$|Like Lion, other {{slaves were}} able to earn small amounts of money outside of their daily duties. Ned and Clem, two wagon masters, earned money by hauling extra loads for other planters. Clem was also a beekeeper, and amassed enough savings to buy his own <b>honey</b> <b>press,</b> which cost $10 and two gallons of honey.|$|R
50|$|Some {{hobbyist}} beekeepers and beekeepers {{in developing}} countries, especially keepers of top-bar hives, cut the whole honey comb {{out of the}} frame, and use it directly as cut comb honey. To extract liquid honey, the comb can be crushed to release the honey and strained to remove the wax and other impurities. Alternatively, cut comb is put into a <b>honey</b> <b>press</b> to squeeze out the honey.|$|R

40|$|In three experiments, rats {{received}} {{training in}} which an aversion was established to one flavor {{and the extent to}} which this aversion generalized to a second flavor was tested. Experiment 1 showed that nonreinforced preexposure to both flavors resulted in reduced generalization between them. Experiments 2 and 3 demon-strated that this reduction in generalization required the two flavors to be presented on alternate trials during preexposure. Subjects given preexposure consisting of a block of trials with one flavor followed by a block of trials with the other showed the same degree of generalization as subjects given no preexposure. The two schedules of stimulus presentation were equated in the total amount of exposure given to each stimulus, making it unlikely that differences in latent inhibition could be responsible for the difference seen on the test. It is suggested that the opportunity for stimulus comparison offered by the alternating schedule might be important in a process of perceptual learning that is responsible for the reduced generalization. 8 1995 Acndcmic <b>Press.</b> Inc. <b>Honey</b> and Hall (1989) and Mackintosh, Kaye, and Bennett (1991) hav...|$|R
60|$|In the market-place at Santa FÃ©, in Mexico, peasant {{women from}} the {{neighbouring}} villages bring in for sale trayfuls of living ants, each about as big and round as a large white currant, and each entirely filled with honey or grape sugar, much appreciated by the ingenuous Mexican youth as an excellent substitute for Everton toffee. The method of eating them would hardly command the approbation of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. It is simple and primitive, but decidedly not humane. Ingenuous youth holds the ant by its head and shoulders, sucks out the honey with which the back part is absurdly distended, and throws away the empty body as a thing with which it has now no further sympathy. Maturer age buys the ants by the quart, <b>presses</b> out the <b>honey</b> through a muslin strainer, and manufactures it into a very sweet intoxicating drink, something like shandygaff, as I am credibly informed by bold persons who have ventured to experiment upon it, taken internally.|$|R
