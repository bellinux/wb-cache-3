The Cu nanowire arrays {{and the individual}} nanowires have been characterized using SEM, TEM, SAED, HREM and XRD. Investigation results reveal that the Cu nanowire arrays having high wire packing densities are highly ordered over large areas. The individual Cu nanowires (diameter ∼ 60 nm) were single-crystal and found to be dense and continuous with uniform diameters throughout their entire length. An optimum ECD condition (at lower overpotentials) for the synthesis of single-crystal Cu nanowires was also discussed. PACS: PACS: 81. 05. Bx; 82. 80. Fk; 85. 30.
