5000|$|Trump National's predecessor, the Ocean Trails Golf Club, {{was part}} of a 150 acre {{property}} owned by developer Edward Zuckerman and a partner. Prior to the Zuckerman purchase, the property was used as a farm. The golf course is on the Palos Verdes Peninsula known for its landslides. The height of the peninsula of [...] above sea level and the action of the waves are two main contributing factors for the landslides. The stratification of the sedimentary rock below the course is visible in the high cliffs of the area as it gradually slopes seaward. The sloping and stratification create favorable conditions for the generation of landslides. As a result, homes and roads have been lost to the ocean in that area. In the area occupied by the golf course and its vicinity, there are three ancient landslides which have been named by geologists as A, B and C respectively. The green of the Ocean Trails golf course 18th hole and <b>half</b> <b>of</b> its <b>fairway</b> were on top of ancient landslide C.|$|R

40|$|Fairway crested wheatgrass, {{which is}} {{identified}} taxonomically as Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn. (45), A. cristatiforme (38), or A. pectiniforme Roem. and Schult (22), is an economically important range grass {{belonging to the}} 2 ̆ 2 crested wheatgrass complex 2 ̆ 2 (24, 38). The crested wheatgrass complex includes diploid, 2 n = 14, tetraploid, 2 n = 28, and hexaploid, 2 n = 42, forms (1, 11, 22). The variety Fairway and Fairway-like derivatives are the only known diploid members of the species complex (24, 38). Meiotic chromosome behavior <b>of</b> <b>Fairway</b> diploids appears to be typical of other diploid species; however, the number of plants examined cytologically has been relatively small. Although Fairway crested wheatgrass is a good seed producer, interplant variation in fertility is high (13, 22, 25, 42). Irregular chromosome behavior is a common source of sterility and may be contributing to the variable seed set in diploid crested wheatgrass. No information is available concerning the relation of meiotic chromosome behavior to fertility in Fairway crested wheatgrass. Polyploid crested wheatgrasses are {{generally considered to be}} of autoploid origin, i. e., they are derived by duplication of the chromosome complement of a diploid prototype. Chromosome pairing in the polyploid species (31), in interspecific hybrids (12), and in polyhaploid plants (11) substantiate the autoploid derivation of polyploid crested wheatgrass. Diploid and tetraploid forms of crested wheatgrass have been hybridized by Knowles (24), and chromosome pairing in the hybrids suggest a close relation between the diploid and tetraploid genomes. Colchicine-induced tetraploids <b>of</b> <b>Fairway</b> crested wheatgrass have been produced by Knowles, 1 and these artificial tetraploids are currently being utilized in his crested wheatgrass breeding program. If the full breeding and cytogenetic potentials of diploid crested wheatgrass are to be realized, the meiotic chromosome behavior and the cytotaxonomic status of this species must be fully understood. The present investigation was designed to provide further information concerning the cytogenetic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>Fairway</b> crested wheatgrass and its autotetraploid derivatives. This investigation was established with the following objectives: 1. To examine meiotic chromosome behavior <b>of</b> <b>Fairway</b> crested wheatgrass. 2. To determine the relation of meiotic chromosome behavior to fertility in Fairway crested wheatgrass. 3. To evaluate the effectiveness of several colchicine treatments in doubling the chromosome complement <b>of</b> <b>Fairway</b> crested wheatgrass. 4. To determine the effect of induced polyploidy on plant morphology in colchicine-induced tetraploids <b>of</b> <b>Fairway</b> crested wheatgrass. 5.

60|$|At {{the time}} when the man-of-war's boat rowed {{alongside}} of the little jetty <b>of</b> <b>Fairway,</b> an interesting couple chanced to be seated in a bower at the back of a very small but particularly neat cottage near the shore.

Roses and honeysuckle were trained up the sides of it, and these, mingling their fragrance with the smell of tar, diffused an agreeable odour around. The couple referred to sat very close to each other, and appeared to be engaged in conversation of a confidential nature. One was a fair and rather pretty girl of the fishing community. The other was a stout and uncommonly handsome man of five-and-twenty, apparently belonging to the same class, but there was more of the regular sailor than the fisherman in his costume and appearance. In regard to their conversation, it may be well, perhaps, to let them speak for themselves.|$|R
