50|$|Interventions {{aimed at}} {{reducing}} disorganization have been developed, for example, the Circle of Security Intervention and the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) intervention. The Circle of Security intervention provides group-based psychotherapy and attachment theory-based education to parents. Research examining {{the effectiveness of the}} intervention found significant changes from disorganized classifications <b>pre-intervention</b> to organised classifications immediately post-intervention. The ABC intervention aims to enhance caregiving sensitivity and decrease frightening behavior. Results of a randomized clinical trial found higher attachment security and lower attachment disorganization in the intervention group than the control group, suggesting this intervention is effective.|$|E

50|$|Media {{literacy}} {{programs can}} be a violence-prevention strategy. Results from a major longitudinal study conducted by UCLA with more than 2,000 Southern California middle school students found that introducing a curriculum aimed at deconstructing violence in the media resulted in increased student knowledge acquisition regarding media literacy and effects of violent media on individuals and society, changed attitudes toward media violence, as well as playground behaviors and media usage. The study used a self-report survey to compare participant's knowledge and attitudes surrounding violence <b>pre-intervention</b> and post-intervention. The study not only evaluated the curriculum, Beyond Blame: Challenging Violence in the Media, but also the Center for Media Literacy's frameworks for addressing media-related themes and topics.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to regular exercise, nutritional antioxidants may combat free radical formation—as {{has been reported}} for GPLC. In this study, subjects received oral GPLC at a dosage of either 1.5 or 4.5 grams per day {{over the course of}} an eight-week intervention period. With both dosages, the post-intervention level of malondialdehyde, a marker of lipid peroxidation, was decreased as compared to <b>pre-intervention</b> values. The same was not true for subjects receiving a placebo. These findings highlight the significant antioxidant properties of GPLC. More work using GPLC to combat resistance exercise-induced lipid peroxidation has also noted favorable findings (unpublished data). While many athletes now use GPLC as a component of their dietary supplement regimen, future work is needed to investigate the impact of GPLC on decreasing oxidative stress resulting from strenuous exercise.|$|E

50|$|Notable {{graduate}} {{students from the}} University of Washington include Ivar Lovaas, who established the UCLA Young Autism Project while teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles, amd devoted {{nearly half a century}} to groundbreaking research and practice aimed at improving the lives of children with autism and their families. He even co-founded what is today the Autism Society of America. In 1965, Lovaas published a series of articles that outlined his system for coding observed behaviors, described a pioneering investigation of the antecedents and consequences that maintained a problem behavior, and built upon these methods to develop an effective way to teach nonverbal children to speak. He also described how to use social (secondary) reinforcers, teach children to imitate, and what interventions (including electric shocks) may be used to reduce aggression and life-threatening self-injury. In 1973, Lovaas published a long-term follow-up of his interventions and was dismayed to find that most of the subjects had reverted to their <b>pre-intervention</b> behaviors. He and his colleagues proposed several ways to improve outcomes, such as starting intervention during the children's preschool years instead of during late childhood or adolescence, involving parents in the intervention, and implementing the intervention in the family's home rather than an institutional setting.|$|E

This study evaluated community interventions that aimed to increase levels of MPA. Intervention themes included exercise referral, classes and groups, peermentoring, motivational interviewing, campaigns and directories, outdoor activity and training physical activity leaders. Design: Longitudinal, <b>pre-intervention</b> and intervention assessments occurred between 2004 and 2006. Setting: Recruitment of 10, 433 people from ten sites located in areas of high health need across England. Method: Demographic data were collected by questionnaire, with seven-day, population-specific self-reports assessing <b>pre-intervention</b> and intervention MPA. Using guidelines for young people and adults, MPA MET-minutes/week were used to assign participants to four MPA categories (sedentary, lightly, moderately and highly active) at <b>pre-intervention</b> and intervention phases.

40|$|Malaria endemic {{countries}} have scaled-up community health worker (CHW) interventions, to diagnose and treat malaria in communities with {{limited access to}} public health systems. The evaluations of these programmes have centred on CHW's compliance to guidelines, but the broader changes at public health centres including utilisation and diagnoses made, has received limited attention. This analysis was conducted during a CHW-intervention for malaria in Rukungiri District, Western Uganda. Outpatient department (OPD) visit data were collected for children under- 5 attending three health centres one year before the CHW-intervention started (<b>pre-intervention</b> period) and for 20 months during the intervention (intervention-period). An interrupted time series analysis with segmented regression models {{was used to compare}} the trends in malaria, non-malaria and overall OPD visits during the <b>pre-intervention</b> and intervention-period. The introduction of a CHW-intervention suggested the frequency of diagnoses of diarrhoeal diseases, pneumonia and helminths increased, whilst the frequency of malaria diagnoses declined at health centres. In May 2010 when the intervention began, overall health centre utilisation decreased by 63 % compared to the <b>pre-intervention</b> period and the health centres saw 32 fewer overall visits per month compared to the <b>pre-intervention</b> period (p< 0. 001). Malaria visits also declined shortly after the intervention began and there were 27 fewer visits per month during the intervention-period compared with the <b>pre-intervention</b> period (p< 0. 05). The declines in overall and malaria visits were sustained for the entire intervention-period. In contrast, there were no observable changes in trends of non-malarial visits between the <b>pre-intervention</b> and intervention-period. This analysis suggests introducing a CHW-intervention can reduce the number of child malaria visits and change the profile of cases presenting at health centres.

Six months after intervention, patients again received the same questionnaires. The dependent variables were the scores of the three domains of the WOMAC and the eight domains of the SF- 36. Results. We recruited 640 patients. The mean age was 71 yrs and 73. 6 % of the patients were females. The multivariate analysis, in which the <b>pre-intervention</b> scores for each domain were added as covariates, showed that the most significant <b>pre-intervention</b> predictors were the baseline scores of each domain.

This equates to 29. 25 hours per week of junior doctor time spent completing EDSs on the four main medical wards. Our aim was to improve the percentage of EDSs completed within 24 hours of discharge from medical wards in the GWH. We proposed and implemented two interventions: 1) Five day EDS summary 2) Protected EDS hour. The five day EDS summary was implemented on wards 1 and 2. The protected EDS hour on ward 3. Ward 1 : mean <b>pre-intervention</b> EDS completion rate: 81. 1 % (six months <b>pre-intervention).</b> This increased by 7. 9 % to 89 % (four week mean EDS completion rate post-intervention) Ward 2 : mean <b>pre-intervention</b> EDS completion rate: 75. 2 %. This increased by 11. 6 % to 86. 8...|$|E

This pre-post pilot study {{assessed}} {{the impact of}} Motivational Interviewing via Co-Active Life Coaching (MI-via-CALC) on the stress management of 30 full-time, English-speaking Canadian undergraduate students, aged 17 - 24 years. Participants were assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at pre-, mid-, and post-intervention. Three one-way, repeated-measures ANOVAs were completed. Statistically significant differences in stress reduction were found between <b>pre-intervention</b> to mid-intervention and between <b>pre-intervention</b> to postintervention. No statistically significant differences occurred between mid- to post-intervention. Inductive content analysis of qualitative interviews at pre-, mid-, and post-intervention revealed participants’ positive experiences...|$|E
