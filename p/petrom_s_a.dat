40|$|The {{analysis}} of the result indicators which express the profitability of a company {{have an important role}} in establishing the strategy to be followed especially during the economic and financial crisis. To highlight the performance of a business and determine the efficiency of the use of inputs, it is necessary to quantify and measure the results, and in order to measure the results we use a range of performance indicators. They are part of a philosophy of continuous improvement, as the one introduced by Deming, "Deming Way", which is based on the repetitive application of the following principles: "planning - implementation - control - action". These indicators measure {{the degree to which the}} results obtained correspond to the efforts and the planned objectives. The purpose of this article is to analyze a company's performance starting from the outcome indicators of the nature of profit, and for reaching this aim we shall have in view the performance of the following objectives: the dynamic {{analysis of}} revenues, expenses and profit, the diagnosis analysis of factorial type of the total profit and of the financial profit at S.

Like {{any other}} {{industrial}} activity, {{the production of}} hydrocarbons affects the environment both through the performance of actual technological process and through undesired accidents, which may occur. The paper presents technical and economic contributions {{in the field of}} monitoring and reducing the ecological impact of petroleum exploitation on the environment and an analysis of technologies used to remove pollution from soils and the subsurface contaminated by hydrocarbons. The first part presents the stream of drilling and production activities and the impact of oil and gas reservoir exploitation on the environment. Also, an assessment of pollution sources and oil industry specific agents is performed. The case study is performed based on the documentation prepared by <b>PETROM</b> <b>S.</b> <b>A.,</b> a member of OMV Group, in connection with Moinesti Operating Area, which includes the investigation performed in Cucuieţi structure and on the samples taken from the area and investigates in the specialized laboratories the Oil and Gas University in Ploieşti. In the last part of this paper, the most important conclusions are presented. They outline the strengths and different issues relating to pollution removal technologies that were presented, but also the results of the performed studies...|$|E

The procedure was varied by the use of different water temperatures, by diving with snorkel breathing, by apnoea without diving, and by apnoea with a stream of air against the face instead of immersion in water. Diving for 12 <b>s</b> elicited <b>a</b> pronounced activation of m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.,</b> the mean increase from control periods being 360 %. The response was stronger with lower water temperatures. Immersion of the whole face evoked a stronger increase in m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> than immersion of mouth and nose only. Diving without apnoea elicited a significant but weaker increase in m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.,</b> whereas apnoea only for 12 s did not influence the sympathetic outflow. Cool air against the face during apnoea for 12 s was associated with a significant increase in m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> The increase in m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> usually occurred before the bradycardia. On emersion, m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> ceased abruptly, whereas the bradycardia persisted for a few seconds. Mental arithmetic during diving did not change the m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> response but reduced the bradycardia. M. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> increased despite increasing blood pressure levels. On emersion, m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> did not reappear until the pre-diving blood pressure level was attained. <b>S.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>a</b> was inhibited on diving, with concomitant vasodilatation in the skin as recorded in the big toe. It is concluded that the response of m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> to diving is initiated by a central 'pattern recognition' of an input from facial receptors, that this input and the effects of apnoea, acting by mutual reinforcement, maintain the strong sympathetic outflow, and that the mechanism releasing m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> on diving overrides the normal blood pressure regulatory function of m. <b>s.</b> <b>a.</b> Diving exerts differentiated influence on different parts of the sympathetic nervous system, as illustrated by the inhibition of <b>s.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>a...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Abnormal {{distributions}} of birthdates, suggesting intrauterine aetiological factors, {{have been found}} in several psychiatric disorders, including one study of out-patients with Seasonal Affective Disorder (<b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> D.). We investigated birthdate distribution in relation to seasonal changes in well-being among a cohort who had completed the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ). Method: A sample of 4904 subjects, aged 16 to 64, completed the SPAQ. 476 were cases of <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> D. on the SPAQ and 580 were cases of sub-syndromal <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> D. (S-S. A. D.). 92 were interview confirmed cases of <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> D. Months and dates of birth were compared between <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> D. cases and all others, between <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> D. and S-S. A. D. cases combined and all others, and between interview confirmed cases and all others. Seasonality, as measured through seasonal fluctuations in well-being on the Global Seasonality Scores (GSS) of the SPAQ, was compared for all subjects by month and season of birth. Results: There was no evidence of an atypical pattern of birthdates for subjects fulfilling criteria for <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> D., for the combined <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> D. / S-S. A. D. group or for interview confirmed cases. There was also no relationship between seasonality on the GSS and month or season of birth. Limitations: Diagnoses of <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> D. made by SPAQ criteria are likely to be overinclusive. Conclusion: Our findings differ from studies of patients with more severe mood disorders, including psychiatric out-patients with <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> D. The lack of association between seasonality and birthdates in our study adds credence to the view that the aetiology of <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> D. relates to separable factors predisposing to affective disorders and to seasonality...|$|R

METHODS AND RESULTS: A custom-made tissue array, containing 291 tissue cores representing 28 tissue types and 21 tumour types, was used to produce sections that were immunostained for <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 2, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 6, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 11, calbindin 1, calbindin 2, S 100 B and parvalbumin. <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 6, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 were expressed in 32 %, 12 % and 28 % of breast cancers, respectively. There was <b>a</b> translocation of <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 11 expression from exclusively nuclear in normal tissues to cytoplasmic and nuclear in all common cancers. CONCLUSIONS: <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 6, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 11 are all expressed in common cancers, especially breast cancer. In addition, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 11 undergoes a nucleocytoplasmic translocation which may have a direct influence on the proliferation of the cancer cells...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Pterygium is an ocular surface {{disease of}} unknown {{etiology}} associated with epithelial and fibrovascular outgrowth from the conjunctiva onto the cornea. S 100 proteins are calcium-activated signaling proteins that {{interact with other}} proteins to modulate biological functions such as cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the presence of various S 100 proteins in pterygium compared to normal conjunctiva. Methods: Immunofluorescent staining using antibodies against <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 4, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 6, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9, and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 11 were conducted to investigate the expression and tissue distribution. S 100 protein secretions and expressions were confirmed using western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. Results: Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated the presence of <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 4, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 6, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9, and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 11 in both conjunctival and pterygial epithelium. No significant difference was found in the localization and expression of <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 4. In both conjunctiva and pterygium, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 4 -positive cells were found in superficial and suprabasal layers. <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 6 expression was strong in the superficial layer of pterygium epithelium but relatively weaker in the suprabasal and superficial cells of normal conjunctiva epithelium. <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8 and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9 were localized in the superficial layer of both pterygium and normal conjunctiva epithelium, with higher levels in pterygium than uninvolved conjunctiva. <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 11 was expressed in the basal cells of conjunctival epithelium but in the suprabasal layers of pterygium epithelium. Western blot and RT–PCR confirmed the presence of <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 4, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 6, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 8, <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 9, and <b>S</b> 100 <b>A</b> 11 in pterygiu...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show and study media {{discourse}} on South Korean people's view of U. <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> in the context of media discourse on Japan and South Korean policy towards Japan, through 269 articles of Sasangye and 281 editorials of Chosun Ilbo before the establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea (1945 ～ 65). At first, I classified the articles and editorials into three categories according to the tone of them; positive tone, negative tone, or neutral tone to U. <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> After that, I analyzed and compared them, and summarized its features as follows. Firstly, they discussed and evaluated U. <b>S.</b> <b>A.,</b> especially American Far East policy, on the basis of the anti-communism ideology. Secondly, they were negative against and critical of U. <b>S.</b> <b>A.,</b> because U. <b>S.</b> preferred Japan on the basis of the national interest. They argued, under the Cold War, U. <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> must give South Korea top priority over others, because South Korea was paying the largest contribution and sacrifice in the Far East. Lastly, they were also negative against and critical of U. <b>S.</b> <b>A.,</b> because U. <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> didn't correct and reform Japan while the democratization of Japan even though U. <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> was obligated to do so...|$|R
