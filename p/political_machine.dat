5|$|Politically {{the city}} was {{dominated}} by the Republican Party, which had developed a strong <b>political</b> <b>machine.</b> The Republicans dominated the post-war elections, and corrupt officials {{made their way into}} the government and continued to control the city through voter fraud and intimidation. The Gas Trust was the hub of the city’s <b>political</b> <b>machine.</b> The trust controlled the gas company supplying lighting to the city. With the board under complete control by Republicans in 1865, they awarded contracts and perks for themselves and their cronies. Some government reform did occur during this time. The police department was reorganized; and volunteer fire companies were eliminated and were replaced by a paid fire department. A compulsory school act passed in 1895, and the Public School Reorganization Act freed the city's education from the <b>political</b> <b>machine.</b> Higher education changed as well. The University of Pennsylvania moved to West Philadelphia and reorganized to its modern form; and Temple University, Drexel University and the Free Library were founded.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} in the Senate, Beckham resumed his legal {{practice}} in Louisville. He sought another term as governor in 1927. This time he {{had the support of}} the Louisville Courier-Journal, which had been purchased by his ally, Robert W. Bingham. He was opposed by a powerful <b>political</b> <b>machine</b> known as the Jockey Club, whose main interest was securing legislation to allow parimutuel betting at the state's horse racetracks.|$|E

Burke was aligned with Mayor Jane Byrne and {{was endorsed by}} the Cook County Democratic Central Committee. Burke's loss in the primary to Richard M.

5|$|In the 20th century, {{the city}} opened {{one of the}} first {{commercial}} airports in the world, the precursor of today's Albany International Airport. During the 1920s a powerful <b>political</b> <b>machine</b> controlled by the Democratic Party arose in the state capital, connected to politics in New York City as well. It marshalled the power of immigrants and their descendants in both cities.|$|E
5|$|Tammany Hall, a Democratic Party <b>political</b> <b>machine,</b> {{began to}} grow in {{influence}} {{with the support of}} many of the immigrant Irish, culminating in the election of the first Tammany mayor, Fernando Wood, in 1854. Tammany Hall dominated local politics for decades. Central Park, which opened to the public in 1858, became the first landscaped public park in an American city.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, large {{cities in the}} United States—Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, New York City, Philadelphia, St. Louis—were accused of using <b>political</b> <b>machines.</b> [...] During this time [...] "cities {{experienced}} rapid growth under inefficient government". Each city's machine lived under a hierarchical system with a [...] "boss" [...] who held the allegiance of local business leaders, elected officials and their appointees, and who knew the proverbial buttons to push to get things done. Benefits and problems both resulted from the rule of <b>political</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R

5|$|White Northern Republicans, {{and some}} Democrats, became excited about an {{abolition}} amendment, holding meetings and issuing resolutions. Many blacks, {{particularly in the}} South, focused more on landownership and education {{as the key to}} liberation. As slavery began to seem politically untenable, an array of Northern Democrats successively announced their support for the amendment, including Representative James Brooks, Senator Reverdy Johnson, and Tammany Hall, a powerful New York <b>political</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the 1922 elections, Cotillo {{became the}} {{chairman}} of the influential State Senate Judiciary Committee, a sign of his rising authority. The post helped him to get ready for a next step. In 1924, he was the first Italian-born to become Justice of the New York Supreme Court, First District, where he would he remain until his death. He was elected with the endorsement of the Tammany Hall <b>political</b> <b>machine,</b> many social welfare organizations and organized labor, the Citizen's Union and several bar organizations.|$|E
5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} family in Indianapolis, Indiana, Howe was a small, sickly, and {{asthmatic}} child. The {{family moved to}} Saratoga, New York after serious financial losses. Howe married Grace Hartley and became a journalist with a small paper that his father purchased. He spent the next decade freelancing for the New York Herald and working various jobs. Howe was then was assigned to cover the New York state legislature in 1906, and soon became a political operative for Thomas Mott Osborne, a Democratic opponent of the Tammany Hall <b>political</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Although these {{elements}} {{are common to}} most political parties and organizations, they are essential to <b>political</b> <b>machines,</b> which rely on hierarchy and rewards for political power, often enforced by a strong party whip structure. Machines sometimes have a political boss, often rely on patronage, the spoils system, [...] "behind-the-scenes" [...] control, and longstanding political ties within {{the structure of a}} representative democracy. Machines typically are organized on a permanent basis instead of a single election or event. The term may have a pejorative sense referring to corrupt <b>political</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Fred Siegel of the center-right Manhattan Institute {{wrote of}} Wells's unflattering take on American democracy: [...] "Wells was {{appalled by the}} decentralised nature of America's locally {{oriented}} party and country-courthouse politics. He was aghast at the flamboyantly corrupt <b>political</b> <b>machines</b> of the big cities, unchecked by a gentry that might uphold civilised standards. He thought American democracy went too far in providing leeway to the poltroons who ran the <b>political</b> <b>machines</b> and the 'fools' who supported them." [...] Siegel goes on to note Wells's dislike of America's not allowing African Americans to vote.|$|R
40|$|Cloudbursting and <b>Political</b> <b>Machines</b> {{represent}} two {{manifestations of}} {{an interest in}} parsing and processing the vast amount of content available through electronic means. I am interested in the analysis and synthesis of information and the two pieces stem from this. <b>Political</b> <b>Machines</b> breaks down the constant flow of chatter from broadcast news networks to expose the rising level of absurdity and sensationalism present therein. Cloudbursting combines and manipulates images of natural and man-made environmental phenomenon through an algorithmic process to create a hybrid space. Both pieces take {{the shape of a}} content presentation system where audio or video clips are presented to the audience. <b>Political</b> <b>Machines</b> is a physical system that sets up an interactive and interpersonal dialog about the current political culture by drawing on ideas from tactical media, found footage, do-it-yourself and hacker cultures. Cloudbursting built visually from the aesthetic traditions of experimental film, video art, and abstract expressionism while simultaneously exploring the unique time-and-place setting of performance through the continuous manipulation of videos. Cloudbursting also explored the notion of spatial depth in projected video and the intersection between video and sculpture by segmenting and re-positioning the traditional rectangular screen in space. Both pieces incorporated a social aspect, either a playful yet confrontational one as in <b>Political</b> <b>Machines</b> or one in which the audience's role as participant or observer is constantly in flux as in Cloudbursting...|$|R
5|$|Chester Alan Arthur (October5, 1829– November18, 1886) was an American {{attorney}} and politician {{who served as}} the 21st President of the United States from 1881 to 1885; he succeeded James A. Garfield upon the latter's assassination. At the outset, Arthur struggled to overcome a slightly negative reputation, which stemmed from his early career in politics as part of New York's Republican <b>political</b> <b>machine.</b> He succeeded by embracing the cause of civil service reform. His advocacy for, and subsequent enforcement of, the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act was the centerpiece of his administration.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, a {{time when}} federal aid for urban renewal was plentiful, Albany did not have growth in its economy or infrastructure. It lost more than 20 percent of its {{population}} during the Corning years, as people moved to newer housing in the suburbs, followed {{by most of the}} downtown businesses moving there as well. While cities across the country grappled with similar issues, the problems were magnified in Albany: interference from the Democratic <b>political</b> <b>machine</b> hindered progress considerably.|$|E
5|$|On March 31, 1958, the Tories won what {{is still}} the largest {{majority}} (in terms of percentage of seats) in Canadian federal political history, winning 208 seats to the Liberals' 48, with the CCF winning 8 and Social Credit wiped out. The Progressive Conservatives won {{a majority of the}} votes and of the seats in every province except British Columbia (49.8%) and Newfoundland. Quebec's Union Nationale <b>political</b> <b>machine</b> had given the PC party little support, but with Quebec voters minded to support Diefenbaker, Union Nationale boss Maurice Duplessis threw the machinery of his party behind the Tories.|$|E

5000|$|Manifest {{functions}} {{are the consequences}} that people observe or expect, or what is intended; latent {{functions are}} those that are neither recognized nor intended. In distinguishing between manifest and latent functions, Merton argued that one must dig to discover latent functions. His example from his 1949 piece, [...] "Manifest and Latent Functions", was an analysis of <b>political</b> <b>machines.</b> Merton began by describing the negative consequences of <b>political</b> <b>machines,</b> and then changed the angle and demonstrated how the people in charge of the machines, acting in their own interest, were meeting the social needs not met by government institutions.|$|R
50|$|The patron-client <b>political</b> <b>machines</b> of the {{countryside}} enabled agrarian oligarchs, especially coffee planters in the dominant state of São Paulo to dominate state structures to their advantage, particularly the weak central state structures that effectively devolved power to local agrarian oligarchies.|$|R
5|$|Sawyer and {{his wife}} were both Republicans in the 1940s. After {{witnessing}} political corruption and voter fraud in their own ward and around the city, they became disillusioned with the party organization in the city and joined the reform effort led by Joseph S. Clark, Jr., and Richardson Dilworth. Clark and Dilworth brought together Democrats, independents, and disaffected Republicans like Sawyer in a coalition against the Republican <b>political</b> <b>machine,</b> which they regarded as irredeemably corrupt. In 1949, Sawyer served as a Democratic committeeman and Clark and Dilworth won city offices that year.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats {{nominated}} {{former governor}} and senator J. C. W. Beckham to challenge Sampson. The primary {{issue in the}} campaign was whether to outlaw parimutuel betting at the state's racetracks. Beckham favored the ban, while Sampson opposed it. A <b>political</b> <b>machine</b> known as the Jockey Club backed Sampson, and several key Democrats bolted the party after Beckham's nomination. Sampson won the governorship by over 32,000 votes, but every other Republican on the ticket lost by small majorities. The results suggested that some carefully coordinated vote swapping had occurred to ensure Beckham's defeat, but none was ever proven.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{reaction}} of most Virginia politicians and newspapers to the Brown decision was restrained. From the 1920s {{to the late}} 1960s, Virginia politics had been dominated by the Byrd Organization, a <b>political</b> <b>machine</b> led by Senator Harry F. Byrd, Sr. (who was also a former governor of Virginia). Top leaders in the Byrd Organization, such as Governor Thomas B. Stanley and then-Attorney General James Lindsay Almond, Jr., were also at first reserved in their reaction to the Brown ruling.|$|E
5000|$|The {{book does}} not touch upon other themes now {{associated}} with the [...] "Gilded Age”, such as industrialization, monopolies, and the corruption of urban <b>political</b> <b>machines.</b> This may be because this book was written {{at the very beginning}} of the period.|$|R
50|$|Under Brazil's Old Republic, the patron-client <b>political</b> <b>machines</b> of the {{countryside}} enabled agrarian oligarchs, especially coffee planters in the dominant state of São Paulo, to dominate state structures to their advantage, particularly the weak central state structures that effectively devolved power to local agrarian oligarchies.|$|R
5000|$|During the Progressive Era a {{coalition}} of middle-class reform-oriented voters, academic experts and reformers hostile to the <b>political</b> <b>machines</b> introduced a series of reforms in urban America, designed to reduce waste and inefficiency and corruption, by introducing scientific methods, compulsory education and administrative innovations.|$|R
5|$|Arthur {{was born}} in Fairfield, Vermont, grew up in upstate New York, and practiced law in New York City. He served as {{quartermaster}} general in the New York Militia during the American Civil War. Following the war, he devoted more time to Republican politics and quickly rose in the <b>political</b> <b>machine</b> run by New York Senator Roscoe Conkling. Appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant to the lucrative and politically powerful post of Collector of the Port of New York in 1871, Arthur was an important supporter of Conkling and the Stalwart faction of the Republican Party. In 1878, the new president, Rutherford B. Hayes, fired Arthur {{as part of a}} plan to reform the federal patronage system in New York. When Garfield won the Republican nomination for president in 1880, Arthur, an eastern Stalwart, was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket.|$|E
5|$|As Bradley's term {{drew to a}} close, {{potential}} Republican {{candidates to}} succeed him were initially few. Some saw Kentucky's 18,000-vote plurality for William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election as {{a sure sign that}} the state would vote Democratic in 1899. Others were not interested in being on the defensive against the inevitable Democratic attacks on Bradley's administration. Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law. Sitting attorney general William S. Taylor was the first to announce his candidacy and soon secured the support of Senator Deboe. Later candidates included Hopkins County judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state auditor Sam H. Stone. The former was Bradley's choice, but Taylor was a skilled political organizer and was able to create a strong <b>political</b> <b>machine</b> amongst the county delegations. He seemed the favorite to win the nomination.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{concerns}} {{that a strong}} conservative would run in the 1980 Republican primary, Mathias did not face any major opposition for his seat. He easily won his party's nomination, and was re-elected by a substantial margin in November. His Democratic counterpart in the election, Edward T. Conroy, positioned himself as more conservative than Mathias. Conroy also made national defense the primary issue of his campaign, where he accused Mathias of being weak. Mathias countered, stating he had voted for over $1.1 trillion in defense spending during {{his career in the}} Senate. By winning easy re-election, Mathias became the first Maryland Republican to win election to a third Senate term, and also the only Republican to win the city of Baltimore up to that point. He also secured support from several precincts of Baltimore's Democratic <b>political</b> <b>machine,</b> and several labor unions.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Political</b> <b>machines</b> {{started as}} grass roots {{organizations}} {{to gain the}} patronage needed to win the modern election.

50|$|A {{coalition}} of middle-class reform-oriented voters, academic experts, and reformers {{hostile to the}} <b>political</b> <b>machines</b> started forming in the 1890s and introduced a series of reforms in urban America, designed to reduce waste and inefficiency and corruption, by introducing scientific methods, compulsory education and administrative innovations.|$|R
50|$|In April 1950, the Social Democratic Party, also pro-Vargas {{but based}} more around {{industrialists}} and state <b>political</b> <b>machines,</b> {{rejected the idea}} of forming a coalition with the PTB or the UDN and decided to run its own candidate. They nominated Cristiano Machado, a little-known congressman for Minas Gerais.|$|R
