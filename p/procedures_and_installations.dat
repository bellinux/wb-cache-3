40|$|The {{so-called}} beam screen (BS) is {{a proven}} solution for intercepting the thermal loads {{caused by the}} circulating beams in the cryogenically-cooled sections of the LHC and minimizing dynamic vacuum effects [1]. The new triplet area foreseen for the HiLumi-LHC (HL-LHC) machine upgrade [2] has the additional feature of needing internal tungsten shields {{to reduce the amount}} of collision debris which is deflected by the high-gradient triplet magnets towards the superconducting magnets' cold masses and coils. The very aggressive optics design, based on large beam separations, calls for a maximum of physical space to remain available to the counter rotating beams in the common BS.

40|$|Optimal {{design of}} a {{borehole}} heat exchanger, as the outer part of a {{ground source heat pump}} heating system, requires information on the thermal properties of the soil. Those data, the effective thermal conductivity of the soil leff and the average temperature of the soil T 0, enable us to determine the necessary number and depth of boreholes. The determination of thermal conductivity of the soil in laboratory ex-periments does not usually coincide with the data under in situ conditions. There-fore, an in-situ method of experimental determination of these parameters, the so-called thermal response test, is presented in this paper. In addition to the de-scription of the experimental <b>procedure</b> <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> overview, the paper de-scribes methods based on theory and presents their basic limitations, through the presentation of experimental data.

30|$|The quality {{standard}} of integrity of information technology (IT) systems aims to guarantee that the information is modified and destroyed only by authorized parties, is modified and destroyed only in authorized ways, and {{is assumed to be}} authentic, (i.e., authorized parties can be verified), and any change of information cannot be repudiated (i.e., cannot be denied by the authorized changing party). There exist several measures to provide end-to-end data integrity. These measures include installation of antivirus programs, establishing authenticity and non-repudiation protocols, applying “check-sum” <b>procedures,</b> <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> of system <b>and</b> data recovery utility software programs. Malware is a common root cause of data corruption, and it can cause intentional or unintentional loss of data integrity. A virus also alters files and renders an information system unusable. A “check-sum” procedure can be used to detect and correct possible data corruption. Other programs can repair the corrupted file automatically, depending on the level of corruption. In more extreme cases, when data seems to be uncorrectable, one can apply automatic restoration from backups.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, the INDOT new {{materials}} department has received numerous erosion control products (mostly geosynthetics) to evaluate as alternatives to riprap and concrete in ditch liners. Potential benefits include lower construction costs and better aesthetics over current products. Unfortunately, no specification, design methodology, or classification system currently exists for these erosion control blankets. In this project 2 ̆ 7 s phase I, existing information and knowledge on erosion control materials used to line highway side drainage ditches were investigated. From the available technical 1 iterature (journal and conference publications, other DOTs specifications, manufacturer documentation, independent test laboratory test data), design methodologies, classification system, product approval <b>procedures,</b> <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> methods were reviewed for temporary and permanent geosynthetic erosion control materials.

40|$|Recent seismic {{events have}} clearly {{confirmed}} {{the vulnerability of}} existing reinforced concrete (RC) structures. In particular, field observation of structures damaged by L’Aquila earthquake strongly confirmed that premature failure of partially confined (i. e. exterior) beam-column joints {{was one of the}} main causes limiting the global structural seismic capacity. Poor attention to details and a lack of adequate transverse reinforcement typically lead to premature brittle shear failure of joints. To provide support to practitioners involved in the L’Aquila reconstruction process, a proper guideline which illustrates the design of local retrofit interventions on structural and non structural elements has been edited by the Italian Civil Protection Department (DPC) and the Laboratories University Network of Seismic Engineering (ReLUIS). In particular, a viable FRP strengthening strategy to increase the seismic performances of partially confined joints (design <b>procedure</b> <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> steps) is widely discussed and presented in the document. To validate the strengthening system recommended in this guideline, an experimental program has been carried out on as-built and FRP strengthened full scale corner RC joints (T shaped joints).

40|$|Since the origin, the use {{of liquid}} oxygen as {{oxidizer}} is widespread in space propulsion. It has {{been the source of}} numerous incidents. Many materials can burn violently in an oxygen enriched environment when ignited. Consequently, it is mandatory to perform oxygen compatibility tests.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 115 - 118) Declining {{land based}} oil reserves {{will require the}} development of offshore oil fields, where the greatest undiscovered potential reserves are located. As the quest turns to deeper water, new advances in technology will be {{required in order to}} utilize these remote reserves economically. Large floating storage tanks, often converted oil tankers, have been used as part of the development scheme for several offshore fields. These tanks eliminate the need for expensive pipelines to shore. In this paper, a new mooring system concept for such permanently moored storage vessels is presented. This mooring system, referred to as the Storage Production Terminal (SPT), maintains the floating storage vessel on location even during the worst possible storm. The SPT consists of a submerged swivel structure attached directly to the bow of a ship. Chains emanating from the swivel connect to anchors on the seafloor. Hoses connect the seabed pipeline to the swivel structure. The historical background leading to the SPT concept is presented, and existing mooring systems are described. The features and characteristics of the system are discussed. Design loads were calculated and confirmed by small scale model tests. The components of the structure, shown in a series of sketches, and their design considerations are described.

40|$|The Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) is a coordinated, multiexpedition {{drilling}} project {{designed to}} investigate fault mechanics and seismogenesis along subduction megathrusts through direct sampling, in situ measurements, and long-term monitoring {{in conjunction with}} allied laboratory and numerical modeling studies. The fundamental scientific objectives of the NanTroSEIZE project include characterizing the nature of fault slip and strain accumulation, fault and wall rock composition, fault architecture, and state variables throughout the active plate boundary system. As part of the NanTroSEIZE program, operations during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 319 included riser drilling, analyses of cuttings and core samples, downhole measurements and logging, and casing at Site C 0009 in the Kumano forearc basin as well as riserless drilling, logging while drilling (LWD), casing, and observatory operations at Site C 0010 across a major splay fault (termed the "megasplay") that bounds the seaward edge of the forearc basin near its updip terminus. In addition, we drilled at contingency Site C 0011 to collect logging-while-drilling data in advance of planned coring operations scheduled as part of IODP Expedition 322. Site C 0009 marked the first riser drilling in IODP history. This allowed several scientific operations unprecedented in IODP, including carefully controlled measurements of in situ pore pressure, permeability and minimum principal stress magnitude, real-time mud gas analysis, and laboratory analyses of cuttings throughout the entire riser-drilled depth range (~ 700 – 1600 meters below seafloor [mbsf]). We conducted a leak-off test at one depth interval and successfully deployed the wireline Modular Formation Dynamics Tester 12 times to directly measure in situ stress magnitude, formation pore pressure, and permeability. During all phases of riser drilling, we collected mud gas for geochemical analyses and cuttings samples were collected throughout the entire riser-drilled depth range. Integration of data from cuttings, wireline logging, and cores (from a limited depth interval) allowed definition of a single integrated set of lithologic units and comparison with previously drilled IODP Site C 0002 to determine the evolutionary history of the forearc basin. After casing the borehole, we conducted a long-offset (up to 30 km) two-ship active seismic experiment, recording shots within the borehole to image the megasplay and master décollement beneath the borehole, and to evaluate seismic velocity and anisotropy of the forearc basin and accretionary prism sediments around the borehole. At riserless Site C 0010, operations included drilling with measurement while drilling (MWD) /LWD across the megasplay fault to 555 mbsf, casing the borehole with screens at {{the depth of the}} fault, conducting an observatory dummy run to test future strainmeter <b>and</b> seismometer deployment <b>procedures,</b> <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> of a temporary pore pressure and temperature monitoring system in advance of planned future permanent observatory emplacement. The observatory system (termed a "smart plug") marks the first observatory installation of the NanTroSEIZE program. MWD/LWD data at this site were used to define unit boundaries and the fault zone target interval for placement of the casing screens. Through comparison with previously drilled Site C 0004 these data also provide insights into along-strike differences in the architecture of the megasplay fault and hanging wall...|$|R
40|$|LectureTwo {{multistage}} barrel type pumps {{were installed}} in {{a nuclear power plant}} in reactor charge application. The pumps are driven by a 600 HP (447 kW) four-pole induction motor through double helical gear increasers. The overall vibration amplitude of the pump casing and the shaft were determined to be acceptable. However, one of the pumps was found with shaft repetitive cracking failures (MTBF = 7. 3 years) initiated away from the key-way stress concentration area, under the later stage impellers, in a zone where fretting was occurring. Several attempts pursued by the plant and their supplier, over the years, did not find the root cause of this shaft cracking problem, in spite of the good troubleshooting <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> careful <b>installation</b> practices pursued. Therefore, an exceptionally comprehensive root cause investigation was implemented, with specialty vibration testing at its core. Thorough vibration testing combining spectral and timetransient vibration testing on the pump casing and shaft, Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) testing of the impeller and pump casing, and Operating Deflection Shape (ODS) testing revealed the dynamic behavior of the pump rotor and the entire pump system. The results identified unsuspected excessive axial shuttling of the pump shaft at the motor running speed frequency due to axial run-out of the helical gear set. Based on the test results and supported by non-linear FEA analysis, the authors identified the root cause of the crack initiation phase of the shaft failure. An additional transient FEA based fracture mechanics analysis approach was able to predict that the stresses in the shaft, underneath the impeller, were able to encourage initiation and propagation of the crack. This lecture demonstrates the effectiveness in machinery root cause investigations of thorough vibration testing including ODS, EMA, and FEA rather than traditional troubleshooting approaches, which had not detected a gear/pump inter-related problem, and would not have provided such clear visual evidence for decision makers...|$|R
