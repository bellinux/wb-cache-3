This technology has so far only been seen on the Water Warriors Aqua Master PreCharger Series. A button is used to toggle whether the pump is priming/pre-pressurizing the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> with air or whether the pump is moving water into the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber.</b> Akin to pre-pressurizing the Separate <b>Pressure</b> <b>Chamber</b> water guns, the split air / water <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> takes this one step further by preventing the accidental, undesired release of the pre-pressurized air by keeping it separated from the water by a sliding piston divider. After all the water is expelled from the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber,</b> the sliding piston prevents loss of the pressurized air, thus {{reducing the number of}} times the water gun must be pumped in order to achieve optimal firing pressure.|$|R

Once the heat source has been removed from the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber,</b> the atmosphere within cools, lowering the pressure and drawing the coffee through a filter and back into the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber.</b> Distinctions from percolator brewing include the fact that the water is not boiled in order to reach the grounds, {{that the majority of the}} extraction takes place during the infusion phase, and that the water is not recycled through the grounds.|$|R

50|$|The air-based {{separate}} <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> or {{firing chamber}} system {{works on the}} same physical principle as the pressurized reservoir system, but instead of pressurizing the reservoir, a separate, fixed volume chamber is included on the water gun into which water is pumped, compressing the air inside. This technology was first used on the Super Soaker SS 100. This allows the reservoir to be removed/opened at any time for refilling since the reservoir is not pressurized. As well, the typically smaller size of the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> {{and the fact that}} water is typically pumped, as opposed to air, reduces the average number of pumps needed to achieve functional pressure. For improved performance, some users opt to pre-pressurize the firing chamber by pumping in some air first. This increases the starting <b>pressure</b> within the <b>chamber,</b> thus increasing the overall average pressure experienced by the water when it is pumped into the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Dysfunction of Eustachian tube (ET) and the {{associated}} pressure equalizing problems are concerning patients especially in flying and diving. The effect of pressure-regulating earplugs (PREP) on complaints while flying has been evaluated. In addition, the effectivity of laser Eustachian tuboplasty (LETP) has been investigate in a <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber.</b> Methods: 60 patients were included in 3 studies. All of them were examined in a hyperbaric <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> with continuous impedance measurement. In the PREP-study 21 patients were examined double-blind with and without PREP in the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber.</b> In the LETP- (n= 30) and the diver-longterm-study (n= 9) the ET function before and after LETP were measured. ET opening pressure, ET closing pressure and ET opening duration were evaluated pre- and postoperatively. In the diver-longterm-study also longterm results after 3 - 4 years were collected. Results: PREP-study: Evidence of ET dysfunction was found in twice as many patients with the impedance method in the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> compared to tympanometry and Valsava test. The number of pressure-equalizing maneuvers did not differ significantly. Patients reported a significantly better subjective state on the visual analogue scale with than without PREP (p < 0. 003). LETP-study: Bevore LETP, 17 patients showed a blocked pattern in <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> testing. Postoperatively, 13 patients of this group showed an improved ET function with a restored normal opening pattern (p < 0. 001). The ET closing pressure was reduced from 6. 24 ± 3. 46 mbar preoperatively to 4. 06 ± 2. 36 mbar postoperatively (p < 0. 013). Diver-longterm-study: Preoperatively 5 divers showed a blocked pattern in <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> testing. In 4 of them a normal opening pattern was restored postoperatively (p < 0. 001). The ET closing pressure was reduced significant from 7. 40 ± 1. 52 mbar preoperatively to 2. 85 ± 1. 11 mbar postoperatively (p < 0. 005). In the long-term, all subjects reported a restored ability for pressure equalization and 7 of 9 were diving again. Conclusion: A combination of Valsalva manoeuver, tympanometry and continuous impedance measurement in the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> identifies more patients with pressure equalizing problems than only the both first mentioned ENT-routine diagnostics allone. Although use of PREP {{showed no signs of}} improving ET function, it did significantly improve individual subjective state during sudden pressure changes. Patients with ET dysfunction seem to benefit from LETP. The improvment of ET function can be proven by impedance measurement in the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> and with determination of ET closing pressure. Divers with ET dysfunction seem to dive after LETP without problems or especially pain...|$|R

50|$|It uses water {{pressure}} from the water supply system rather than gravity from a raised tank like in previous models. A diaphragm separates a <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> from the main water supply. A narrow passageway leads from the main water supply into the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber.</b> It is the narrowness of this passage that meters the flow by slowing repressurizing of the <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> after the action of a flush. The diaphragm technology allows the flush valve to open and let water into the bowl. A main cylinder valve operates up and down. A groove in this cylinder allows water from the main supply to flow through when {{it is in a}} mid position. The valve is shut off at both its top and bottom positions. A second valve, placed within the main cylinder valve, releases the water in the topmost <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> when the flush lever is activated, sending the main cylinder valve shooting upwards. The topmost <b>pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> slowly refills through its narrow passageway, pushing the valve cylinder back down gradually. A flush occurs while it is in its open mid positions. Because the water is gradually shut off, slower water {{at the end of the}} cycle that will not activate the siphon serves to refill the bowl. The valve cannot be kept open by holding the flush lever in the activated position, wasting water, because this only sends the main cylinder valve all the way up to its topmost shutoff position.
