40|$|A new {{transducer}} {{for measuring}} normal and shear stress in physical modelling {{was designed and}} tested. From many methods of contact stress measurements, a local approach based on <b>pin</b> <b>load</b> <b>cell</b> was chosen. The sensing element employed was a stack of piezoelectric plates which measured three components of the force directly. The design process included a study of piezoelectricity in various materials, designing a prototype transducer and choosing an appropriate electronic circuit. The piezoelectric stack and the whole transducer were tested using a calibration rig capable of applying the normal and tangential force independently. Calibration results confirmed the suitability of the adopted concept and provided guidelines for proper design of the final transducer. In particular, a new calibration procedure was proposed which took into account interactions between the measured force components...|$|E

Recently the indirectly measuring method, which measures hoisting load and overturning moment of overload limiter, demands instead of the existing method, which measures only hoisting load. The indirectly measuring method is how to conduct the hoisting load and overturning moment as measuring the load of hydraulic cylinder for a luffing driving of boom. So {{we need to develop}} the many-angular <b>pin</b> type <b>load</b> <b>cell</b> with the measuring angle of ± 10 degree instead of the existing <b>load</b> <b>cell</b> with the measuring angle of ± 2 degree.

Drilled shaft foundation elements provide a cost-effective foundation alternative for the support of building and bridge superstructure loads. Bi-directional pile loading tests (BDPLTs) to evaluate the capacity of drilled shafts have become popular owing to their capacity to save time and effort as compared to the use of top-down loading tests. However, the use of BDPLTs requires that production shafts be post-grouted following testing in order to assure appropriate in-service performance. Commonly used single-acting <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> and/or <b>loading</b> <b>cell</b> construction details can pose the potential for the development of voids following post-grouting due to their monotonic jacking action and large footprint. This paper described the development and use of high pressure bi-directional <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> intended to minimize the possibility of post-test construction defects. First, a comparison was made between the single-acting and double-acting <b>loading</b> <b>cells.</b> Second, the results of laboratory calibrations on the pressurized <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> were performed, as were component testing of the pumps, hoses, and hydraulic fluid synchronization lines.
