One {{of them was}} a small <b>postal</b> <b>van</b> which was built {{at the request of the}} German Postal Services. By 1964 the Type 147 or Kleinlieferwagen was in production. In popular culture it has also been christened the nickname of Fridolin.|$|E

2500|$|Three {{matching}} [...] guard's vans {{were also}} heavily overhauled and, {{due to their}} role as luggage vans, were fitted with Japanese Kinki-Sharyo manufactured bogies, classed X27250 by NZR, {{out from under the}} three [...] <b>postal</b> <b>vans,</b> these bogies being of a more modern design than those under carriages at the time and suited for heavier stock.|$|R
50|$|On 9 December 1995, North and South Railways {{purchased}} Rail Express Systems for £24 million. With {{this came}} the {{contract for the}} Royal Mail train service, including the Travelling Post Office trains, and the contract to haul the Royal Train. A fleet of 164 locomotives and 677 <b>postal</b> <b>vans</b> were included along with depots at Bristol Barton Hill, Cambridge, Crewe and London Euston.|$|R
5000|$|In 1954, the CTS {{handed over}} the Rosheim [...] - [...] Saint-Nabor line (via Ottrott) to , {{which led to the}} {{discontinuation}} of passenger traffic on that line.

He {{and his wife}} had a second child, a son named Ben.|$|E
50|$|Jakab Industries {{built its}} first bus body in July 1973, a Ford R226. It mainly made bodies for buses for the defence forces, but also built some for {{commercial}} operators, before {{withdrawing from the}} market in late 1995.

5000|$|In February 1962 the German Postal Services {{commissioned}} Volkswagen {{to design}} them a <b>postal</b> <b>van</b> that would suit their needs. To lower costs, VW {{started off with}} the Karmann produced Beetle cabriolet (Type 15) as basis for the van due to its strength in build but later turned to the Karmann Ghia (Type 14) for basis as it was wider. The engine, the transmission and axles originated from the VW Beetle Type 1, the headlights from the VW 1500, and the tailgate (scaled-down) from the VW Transporter (Type 2).|$|E
50|$|As the {{locomotive}} rounded a curve {{just south of}} Ongarue at about 5.52 am the next morning, it struck a landslip caused by heavy rain. Embedded in the landslip was a boulder of about 1.5 metres diameter. This boulder derailed {{the locomotive}} and threw it onto the bank of a cutting, causing {{the first and second}} carriages to telescope completely. The third carriage was partly telescoped onto the second. The <b>postal</b> <b>van,</b> between the locomotive and first carriage, was almost undamaged and none of its three postal workers was injured. About four chains (88 yards, 80.4 metres) of track were torn up.|$|E
50|$|The co-founders {{launched}} {{the company with}} a $10,000 initial investment: they bought a 20-year-old <b>postal</b> <b>van</b> off Craigslist, converted it into a food truck, {{and used it to}} sell ice cream sandwiches at the popular Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Although the truck had a faulty engine—it had to be towed to the festival and back—exposure to an audience of 160,000 made the outing a success. Coolhaus subsequently went viral with Twitter followers and inquiries from the Los Angeles Times and other media outlets. Case left her job at Disney within {{a month and a half}} and committed full-time to Coolhaus.|$|E
25|$|The {{transfer}} of mail between the inter-island steamer ferries and trains {{used to be}} a significant source of traffic for Lyttelton. Mail items were transported in hampers, bags, or crates, and transferred on and off the ship using slings. Local services were used to transport the mail between Christchurch and the port in <b>postal</b> <b>vans.</b> Following the introduction of the rail-air service in the 1960s, use of the ferries to transport the mail between Christchurch and Wellington declined.|$|R
5000|$|Production of {{carriage}} stock began {{soon after}} opening in 1929, {{the first of}} which were 10 50-ft [...] "Aa" [...] suburban carriages. Another batch of 50 ft cars was completed for the new Rotorua Limited Express service, including two observation cars. A large number of 50 ft cars were built prior to the introduction of the 56-ft cars, built between 1937 and 1945. Otahuhu built 207 carriages, 75 guards vans, 3 steam <b>vans,</b> 3 <b>postal</b> <b>vans,</b> and many wagons.|$|R
5000|$|Yellow is {{the main}} colour of the French post since the 1960s. Previously, <b>postal</b> <b>vans</b> used to be green and post boxes blue. Yellow was chosen {{because it is a}} colour that is easily seen and because it can symbolise speed and light. The {{logotype}} of La Poste was created by poster designer Guy Georget. It represents a bird, often called the [...] "postal bird" [...] ("l'oiseau postal"), symbolising a messenger. Its design was slightly altered by Georget in 1978.|$|R
50|$|Justice's friend Iesha (Regina King) {{manages to}} talk Justice into taking {{a road trip}} to Oakland with Iesha's boyfriend, Chicago (Joe Torry), Lucky's co-worker at the post office. Justice warily accepts, mainly because {{she has to go}} to Oakland for a hair show, and her car stops working at the last minute. Unbeknownst to Justice, Lucky is also on the trip, and she will now be sharing a <b>postal</b> <b>van</b> with him and their two mutual friends. Initially they argue, but {{over the course of the}} film soften towards each other as they {{discover}} their similarities.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Gama {{introduced}} its diecast old car series, once again applying the [...] "MiniMods" [...] name, but now only used for these models that {{were similar to}} Matchbox Models of Yesteryear. A brightly colored box style was used (see photo above) that hinted of the 1920s or 1930s design. Sometimes the castings were a bit crude, but often the selection was interesting like the three wheeled German <b>postal</b> <b>van</b> (Gibson 1972, pp. 32-33). The similarity to Yesteryear models was evident in simpler detail, dull precision and size, but instead of British selections, {{the focus was on}} classic cars of the European mainland.|$|E
50|$|At around 4:09 am the Mail {{approached}} Tamworth {{at around}} 50 mph (85 kmh), the driver {{saw that the}} signal was set for the loop and applied the emergency brakes, but could not stop before being diverted onto the platform loop {{and then into the}} siding. The train had slowed down to about 15 mph when it hit the buffer stop {{at the end of the}} siding. The locomotive went through the buffers and crashed into the River Anker. A coach and a <b>postal</b> <b>van</b> overturned into the reservoir. The driver and fireman on the engine, and one passenger were killed. Thirteen other people were injured, including ten passengers, two postal staff, and a guard who was seriously injured.|$|E
25|$|All 31 cars ran on bogies of a newer design, classed X28250 by NZR, {{which offered}} a {{superior}} quality ride, through better absorption of inertial dampers and better suspension, and bore a {{resemblance to the}} Kinki-Sharyo -manufactured bogies, classed X27250 by NZR, under steam <b>vans</b> and <b>postal</b> <b>vans</b> built by Kinki. The bogies built especially for the Northerner trains four years later and the FM - class vans two to six years after that, classed X28280, were heavily modeled after those under the Star cars.|$|R
25|$|Bill Ford {{was one of}} {{the first}} top {{industry}} executives to make regular use of a battery electric vehicle, a Ford Ranger EV, while the company contracted with the United States Postal Service to deliver electric <b>postal</b> <b>vans</b> based on the Ranger EV platform. Ford discontinued a line of electric Ranger pickup trucks and ordered them destroyed, though it reversed in January 2005, after environmentalist protest. The all-electric pickup truck leased 205 units to individuals and 1,500 units to fleets in the U.S. from 1998 to 2002.|$|R

50|$|On 24 December 1953 the 3 pm express from Wellington to Auckland {{consisted}} of a KA class steam locomotive hauling 11 carriages: five second class, four first class, a guard's van and a <b>postal</b> <b>van.</b> With 285 passengers and crew, the train was stated by a witness—the station agent at Tangiwai railway station—to have passed through Tangiwai Station on time at 10:20 pm at about 40 mph. The specified maximum track speed between Hihitahi (to the south of Tangiwai) and Ohakune (to the north) {{at the time was}} 50 mph. There was no evidence presented to the Board of Inquiry regarding any calculations made or indications of the speed of locomotive 949 either as it approached the incident site or {{at the time of the}} incident.|$|E
50|$|Postman Pat′s first 13-episode {{series was}} {{screened}} on BBC1 in 1981. John Cunliffe wrote the original treatment and scripts, {{and it was}} directed by animator Ivor Wood, who also worked on The Magic Roundabout, The Wombles, Paddington Bear, and The Herbs. Following {{the success of the}} first series, four TV specials and a second series of 13 episodes were produced during the 1990s. Here, Pat had a family for the first time. A new version of the series was produced by Cosgrove Hall Films from 2003, which expanded on many aspects of the original series. In 2000, Royal Mail stopped using Postman Pat for their promotional and charity work. The television programme continued to use the Royal Mail logo on his <b>postal</b> <b>van</b> PAT 1 for several years after.|$|E
50|$|The {{first is}} the Postman himself, Gordon Krantz, who takes the uniform solely for warmth after he loses {{everything}} but his sleeping clothes. He wanders without establishing himself anywhere and performs scenes from William Shakespeare plays for supplies. Originally {{a student at the}} University of Minnesota, he has traveled west to Oregon {{in the aftermath of the}} worldwide chaos that resulted from several EMPs, the destruction of major cities, and the release of bioweapons. Taking shelter in a long-abandoned <b>postal</b> <b>van,</b> he finds a sack of mail and takes it to a nearby community to barter for food and shelter. His initial assertions to be a real postman build not because of a deliberate fraud (at least initially) but because people are desperate to believe in him and the Restored United States.|$|E
