Due to narrow resource base and production conditions, Pacific Islands concentrate on a few primary commodities for production and exports. During recent years import dependency for food items has increased mainly due {{to a decline in}} per capita food production and a rapid rate of rural-urban migration. Currently, export earnings can finance food imports but earnings could fall short of the requirements needed after the expiry of some commodity <b>preferential</b> <b>price</b> agreements with importing countries. National food security is dependent on the continuation of subsistence farming and tapping ocean resources in conjunction with the on-going commercial farming of those crops in which Pacific Islands have a comparative advantage. Increased productivity is crucial for improving agricultural performance through government investment in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension, irrigation and appropriate price incentives. This would also help alleviate poverty for improvement in economic accessibility of food by households. There is also a need to design appropriate disaster risk management programmes to minimize any adverse effects on the food supply...|$|E
40|$|Spain is a {{world leader}} in solar energy {{production}} and until 2009 operated a feed-in tariff policy that provided solar energy producers with a <b>preferential</b> <b>price</b> for the electricity they fed back into the grid. This policy was scaled back in 2009 when Spain found itself facing severe economic downturn. It has now been repealed entirely. While domestic investors in solar energy had to absorb the resulting loss in profits, foreign investors sought compensation under the Energy Charter Treaty. They alleged that Spain had breached its obligations as a signatory state and commenced arbitral proceedings accordingly. These arbitral proceedings signal {{the first time that}} the Energy Charter Treaty has been used to resolve a dispute over renewable energy investment as well as {{the first time that the}} treaty has been used by multiple investors to claim against a host state.

40|$|The {{meaning of}} the covert {{co-ownership}} is that the parties must have intended that the property should be their common. A party must, {{to be able to}} claim ownership, have con-tributed to the acquisition financing through the financial contribution. Further shall the fact that the property should be their common be agreed or have been assumed by the par-ties. There are the circumstances for the purchase that should be considered in determining if covert co-ownership is presumed. Covert co-ownership has been established although one party only contributed a small part to the acquisition. The party with a possible loan is also considered to have acquired the property, although the party who claims to be the hidden owner is the one who pays the loan. If one of the parties has received a soft loan or a <b>preferential</b> <b>price,</b> the difference seems to be viewed as a financial contribution, which al-so applies to work on the property.

Although the par-ties have established cohabitation agreement or marriage contract for a property have co-vert co-ownership still been considered to exist.

30|$|The primary aim {{of social}} network {{analysis}} is to observe social interactions, but not every phone call is made with the same social purpose. Some calls might be for business purposes, some might be accidental calls, some nodes may be call centers that call {{a large number of}} people, and all such interactions are present in CDRs. In short, CDRs are noisy datasets. ‘Cleaning’ operations are usually needed to eliminate some of the accidental edges. For example, Lambiotte et al. [13] imposed as condition for a link that at least one call is made in both directions (reciprocity) and that at least 6 calls are made in total over 6 months of the dataset. This filtering operation appeared to remove a large fraction of the links of the network, but at the same time, the total weight (the total number of calls passed in by all users) was reduced by only a small fraction. The threshold of 6 calls in 6 months may be questionable, but a stability analysis around this value can comfort that the exact choice of the threshold is not crucial. Similarly, Onnela et al. [14] analyzed the differences between the degree distribution of two versions of the same dataset, one containing all calls of the dataset, and the other containing only calls that are reciprocated. Some nodes in the complete network have up to 30, 000 different neighbors, while in the reciprocated network, the maximal degree is close to 150. Clearly, in the first case {{it is hard to imagine}} that node representing a single person, while the latter is a much more realistic bound. However, even if calls have been reciprocated, the question of setting a meaningful weight on each link is far from easy. Li et al. suggest another more statistical approach in [15], and use multiple hypothesis testing to filter out the links that appeared randomly in the network and that are therefore not the mirror of a true social relationship. Further than these considerations of which calls or texts are representative of a true relationship, further corruptions of the data can arise from multiple calls, multiple text messages or calls reaching an answering machine. Depending on the context, it may be preferable to filter out these communications, but they remain, most of the time, difficult to identify in the datasets. Moreover, additional biases can arise from the pricing plans of the operator, putting a <b>preferential</b> <b>price</b> for SMSs or for voice calls, thus influencing the behavior of the users that opted for such a pricing plan [16].|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Within {{the context}} of {{increasing}} antimalarial costs and or decreasing malaria transmission, the importance of limiting antimalarial treatment to only those confirmed as having malaria parasites becomes paramount. This motivates for this assessment of the cost-effectiveness of routine use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) {{as an integral part}} of deploying artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). Methods The costs and cost-effectiveness of using RDTs to limit the use of ACTs to those who actually have Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia in two districts in southern Mozambique were assessed. To evaluate the potential impact of introducing definitive diagnosis using RDTs (costing $ 0. 95), five scenarios were considered, assuming that the use of definitive diagnosis would find that between 25 % and 75 % of the clinically diagnosed malaria patients are confirmed to be parasitaemic. The base analysis compared two ACTs, artesunate plus sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (AS+SP) costing $ 1. 77 per adult treatment and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) costing $ 2. 40 per adult treatment, as well as the option of restricting RDT use to only those older than six years. Sensitivity analyses considered lower cost ACTs and RDTs and different population age distributions. Results Compared to treating patients on the basis of clinical diagnosis, the use of RDTs in all clinically diagnosed malaria cases results in cost savings only when 29 % and 52 % or less of all suspected malaria cases test positive for malaria and are treated with AS+SP and AL, respectively. These cut-off points increase to 41. 5 % (for AS+SP) and to 74 % (for AL) when the use of RDTs is restricted to only those older than six years of age. When 25 % of clinically diagnosed patients are RDT positive and treated using AL, there are cost savings per malaria positive patient treated of up to $ 2. 12. When more than 29 % of clinically diagnosed cases are malaria test positive, the incremental cost per malaria positive patient treated is less than US$ 1. When relatively less expensive ACTs are introduced (e. g. current WHO <b>preferential</b> <b>price</b> for AL of $ 1. 44 per adult treatment), the RDT price to the healthcare provider should be $ 0. 65 or lower for RDTs to be cost saving in populations with between 30 and 52 % of clinically diagnosed malaria cases being malaria test positive. Conclusion While the use of RDTs in all suspected cases has been shown to be cost-saving when parasite prevalence among clinically diagnosed malaria cases is low to moderate, findings show that targeting RDTs at the group older than six years and treating children less than six years on the basis of clinical diagnosis is even more cost-saving. In semi-immune populations, young children carry the highest risk of severe malaria and many healthcare providers would find it harder to deny antimalarials to those who test negative in this age group. </p...|$|E
