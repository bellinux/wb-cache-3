50|$|Equine {{recurrent}} uveitis (ERU), {{also known}} as moon blindness, recurrent iridocyclitis or <b>periodic</b> <b>ophthalmia,</b> is an acute, nongranulomatous inflammation of the uveal tract of the eye, occurring commonly in horses of all breeds, worldwide. The causative factor is not known, but several pathogeneses have been suggested. It {{is the most common}} cause of blindness in horses. In some breeds, a genetic factor may be involved.|$|E
5000|$|The {{breeding}} of Auvergne horses for light cavalry was {{managed by the}} National Stud and associated farmers. As {{the size of the}} Auvergne horse was too small for light cavalry it was crossed with the Thoroughbred and Anglo-Norman resulting in the [...] "half-blood Auvergne" [...] a horse of [...] "light size" [...] destined for war and widely used during the wars of empire. It had little in common with the old type of breed. Farmers were reluctant to cross with Thoroughbreds, preferring the Arabian. Although Eugene Gayot defended the usefulness of these crosses, they often had poor results from creating horses with slender limbs, long kidneys, flat ribs, and a lot less hardy than the original Auvergne horse According to Andre Sanson they had strong ancestral qualities of the Auvergne horse. In addition rearing conditions were so bad that a third of the population was infected by <b>periodic</b> <b>ophthalmia.</b>|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} communication (1) {{one of us}} together with Burky reported {{the results of a}} bacteriological study of <b>periodic</b> <b>ophthalmia</b> in horses. Both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of eyes freshly enucleated from horses with both active and quiescent <b>periodic</b> <b>ophthalmia,</b> were uniformly negative. The disease, however, has been shown by others to be definitely transmissible by inoculation into a normal eye of an exudate from an eye that was the seat of active disease. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to report the pathology of the disease as observed in the epidemic which we have investigated and to publish observations indicating that in this particular epidemic the disease was caused by a filterable agent. In the fall of 1926 there occurred a sudden outbreak of <b>periodic</b> <b>ophthalmia</b> among thorough-bred horses on a farm located in highrolling country in northern Maryland. The clinical appearance of the disease in this epidemic was identical with that observed elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|A {{filterable}} agent {{has been}} {{obtained from the}} humors and tissues of the eyes of horses suffering from active <b>periodic</b> <b>ophthalmia.</b> The intra-vitreous injection of this filtrate produced in normal horses the same clinical and pathological picture observed in the natural disease. This filtrate injected into rabbits produced a different clinical picture, but the essential pathological lesions closely resembled those found in horses. After passage of the filterable agent through six generations of rabbits, it again produced the clinical and pathological picture of the natural disease when injected {{into the eyes of}} normal horses. It appears, in this epidemic at least, that this filterable agent was the specific etiological factor of the <b>periodic</b> <b>ophthalmia...</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Periodic</b> <b>ophthalmia</b> is {{a disease}} of the eye {{affecting}} horses, mules and asses only. Etiology of this disease is not known, although existing evidence points to a virus as the possible cause. It {{is characterized by a}} recurring inflamma-tion which may effect one eye alone, or both eyes either simultaneously or alter-nately, or one eye until blindness occurs and then the other eye. The onset of the attack is sudden, usu-ally being noticed first in the morning, the animal having appeared normal the night before. The eyelids are swollen and tender and the eyes are kept closed. A watery discharge runs from the eyes. There is some rise of body temperature, accompanied by other evidences of a generalized disturbance. After a week or ten days the inflammation subsides and the eye, or eyes, either may be little affected or may be chalk white and com-pletely blind. The interval between at-tacks may vary from a few weeks to sev-eral months and the number of attacks may vary from one to twenty, occurring over a period of years. Blindness following early attacks is usually due to adhesions of the iris to The first half of Mr. Fertig's paper appeare...|$|E
40|$|Leptospirosis is a world-wide {{zoonotic}} infection occurring in animals and humans. Rodents and wild animals {{are a major}} source of infection. Clinical signs in animals include fever, heamoglubinuria, jaundice, abortion, mastitis, reduced milk production, reproductive failure and death with <b>periodic</b> <b>ophthalmia,</b> abortion and stillbirths being among its important signs in horses. The main {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the risk factors for the prevalence of leptospiral infection in horses of Gonbad area. This study was conducted on 200 horses in Gonbad area in Iran in order to determine seroprevalence of leptospiral infection. Sera were initially screened at dilution of 1 : 100 against 7 live serovars of Leptospira interrogans: Pomona, Canicola, Hardjo, Ballom, Icterohaemorrhagiae, AutomenalisandGrippotyphosausing themicroscopic agglutination test. The prevalence of leptospiral infection was 12 % in horses. The majority of these infections were seen in horses that live in marsh and semi-marsh conditions and they accounted for 89 % of positive samples. The highest number of reactors in horses (58. 34 %) wasdue toserovarCanicola and 33. 34 % of positive samples were seen in horses with many rodents living in their environment. 66. 67 % of positive samples were seen in horses that were kept In moist and semi moist stables. The highest number of positive samples were seen in 3 to 6 years old animals, in other words prevalence of this disease is raised with increase of age. So according to the results, increasing age, living in marsh environment, moist stable presence of infected dogs and rodents, in environment are some of risks factors for prevalence of leptospiral infectio...|$|E
