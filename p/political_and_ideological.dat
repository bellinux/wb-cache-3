5|$|The Nazis also {{targeted}} {{religious groups}} for <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>ideological</b> reasons. Thousands of Christian clergy were killed, including some with a Jewish background (Edith Stein, for example). The Nazis considered Jews a racial group; secular people {{and those of}} other religions who had Jewish ancestry were, therefore, Jews (a belief shared by some Jews).|$|E
5|$|Following the {{restoration}} of the veneration of icons in March 843, the Byzantine Empire's government, headed by the Empress-regent Theodora and the logothetes Theoktistos, embarked on a sustained assault on the Byzantines' main <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>ideological</b> foe, the Abbasid Caliphate and its dependencies. This aggressive stance was on the one hand facilitated by the internal stability {{that the end of the}} Iconoclasm controversy brought, and on the other encouraged by a desire to vindicate the new policy through military victories against the Muslims.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1934, Himmler oversaw the {{creation}} of SS-Junkerschule (Junker schools), institutions where SS officer candidates received leadership training, <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>ideological</b> indoctrination, and military instruction. The training stressed ruthlessness and toughness as part of the SS value system, which helped foster a sense of superiority among the men and taught them self-confidence. The first schools were established at Bad Tölz and Braunschweig, with additional schools opening at Klagenfurt and Prague during the war.|$|E

5|$|Al-Jamri {{has written}} two books in Arabic, Memories of Childhood (2007) and Interventions on Thought and Politics (2008). The former is a {{narrative}} of al-Jamri's childhood in Iraq, the experiences he had and the events he witnessed. He was motivated to write it by people's reactions {{following the death of}} his father and dedicated the book to his memory. The latter deals with <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>ideological</b> concepts in Europe and the Muslim world, and how Muslim countries can benefit from them in order to consolidate the political pluralism within the Islamic theme. Al-Jamri also writes a daily column in Al-Wasat and regular articles on politics and human rights for other publications such as Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.|$|E
5|$|The Bulgarian monarch was {{satisfied}} with the results and considered that he had superiority over the Byzantine Empire to achieve his political ambitions— to assume the throne in Constantinople. Despite the success, however, Simeon I {{realized that there was}} still a lot {{to do in order to}} prevail over the Empire for good. He needed his own <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>ideological</b> base and launched an ambitious construction programme in Preslav so that it could rival Constantinople. In addition, Simeon I took precautions to reduce the Byzantine influence over the Western Balkans by imposing his authority over the Principality of Serbia in return for recognizing Petar Gojniković as its ruler.|$|E
5|$|Printing in China {{initially}} had {{a similar}} development, starting with the printing of religious scriptures, prayers and popularly useful texts such as almanacs or calendars which were produced for local use by temples. By the Five Dynasties, the government realized the opportunities of printing <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>ideological</b> texts such as the Classics. The ensuing Song Dynasty saw great advancements in art, religion and philosophy with scholarly activity greatly facilitated by printed books. Consequently, the Chinese publishing industry took off during the Song Dynasty, several hundred years before the same happened in Japan. Enhanced by the Song interest of foreign trade and the maritime activity of the Taira, the book exchange between China and Japan saw a second peak after the Sui and Tang Dynasties starting in 1192. Japanese visitors to Song China returned {{with a large number}} of printed books, on a variety of subjects such as history, philosophy, Buddhism, Confucianism, literature, medicine and geography, causing a revival of pure scholarship, which had been sidelined during the earlier obsession with poetry in the Heian period courtier society.|$|E

25|$|During {{much of its}} history, and {{especially}} during the Francoist dictatorship (1939–1975), the Catalan language has often been degraded as a mere dialect of Spanish.

25|$|From {{the early}} 1950s on, China's revolutionary {{government}} made great efforts {{to put the}} state and its ideology into direct contact with the villages and to sweep aside the intermediaries and brokers who had traditionally interpreted central policies and national values for villagers.

25|$|Another theory {{considers}} anti-Russian sentiment {{as being}} born in Finland {{at the time}} of civil war 1917–1918, and the anti-Russian <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>ideological</b> White Finland created a confrontation which deliberately blew and spread the sentiment. Anti-Russian sentiment was created against the external threat of the Soviet Union and it was considered almost a national duty in the 1920s and 1930s. During World War II, Finns organized internment camps in the occupied East Karelia where ethnic segregation between 'relatives' (Finnic population) and 'non-relatives' (other, primarily Russian population) took place which has been attributed to anti-Russian sentiment.|$|E
