50|$|On mass-produced clothing, the <b>seam</b> {{allowances}} of <b>plain</b> <b>seams</b> {{are usually}} trimmed and stitched {{together with an}} overlock stitch using a serger. <b>Plain</b> <b>seams</b> may also be pressed open, with each seam allowance separately secured with an overlock stitch. Traditional home sewing techniques for finishing <b>plain</b> <b>seams</b> include trimming with pinking shears, oversewing with a zig-zag stitch, and hand or machine overcasting.|$|R

40|$|This NebGuide covers seam {{finishes}} for a <b>plain</b> <b>seam.</b> A <b>plain</b> <b>seam</b> is {{the basic}} element in all garment construction. It is created by stitching two pieces of fabric together, usually 5 / 8 inch from the cut edge using 10 - 12 stitches per inch. It is used {{with a variety of}} fabrics and found in all areas of a garment. Unless noted differently in the pattern instructions, the seam allowance is pressed open and an appropriate seam finish is used. For fabrics that ravel excessively, consider finishing the edge of the fabric before sewing the seam...|$|R
50|$|A seam finish is a {{treatment}} that secures and neatens the raw edges of a <b>plain</b> <b>seam</b> to prevent raveling, by sewing over the raw edges or enclosing {{them in some}} sort of binding.|$|R
50|$|A <b>plain</b> <b>seam</b> is {{the most}} common type of machine-sewn seam. It joins two pieces of fabric {{together}} face-to-face by sewing through both pieces, leaving a seam allowance with raw edges inside the work. The seam allowance usually requires some sort of seam finish to prevent raveling.|$|R

5000|$|The {{regulation}} {{states that}} the can manufacturer is responsible for providing the can filler with guidelines and specifications for the can seam: [...] "Can seam guidelines (specifications) are provided to the low acid canned food manufacturer by the supplier of the container and end being used. The guidelines detail the measurements, in thousands of an inch, of each attribute of the <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> for both {{the first and second}} seaming operations. They also provide a set-up aim or ideal starting dimensions for the set up of the seamer. The operating limits set the range for good practice." [...] While specifying these guidelines is important, the plant is responsible for the <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> quality: [...] "It is extremely important to understand that seam guidelines by themselves cannot be used for determining the quality of a <b>double</b> <b>seam.</b> The seam guidelines are to be used in setting up the <b>double</b> <b>seams</b> initially and maintaining seam integrity during production. Final acceptability of the <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> should be based on total evaluation of the seam by a qualified person and not on dimensions alone. Good seaming practice requires constant visual examination, frequently scheduled tear-down evaluation, machine maintenance, and immediate correction of unacceptable conditions." [...] The regulation also states that if the <b>double</b> <b>seams</b> do not meet the guidelines, the can filler plant [...] "must know what steps to take to correct the condition".|$|R

50|$|When {{completed}} {{the building was}} occupied by a partnership between Marsland {{and two of his}} sons-in-law, Richard Hole and Alexander Lingard. When the business was established in 1834-6 he removed himself from the partnership and a third son-in-law, William Courteney Cruttenden joined the firm. In 1851, Richard Hole was bought out. Lingard share passed to his son John Marsland Lingard on his death in 1860 and by 1870 John Marsland Lingard was the sole occupier. In 1872 he leased the building to John and George Walthew a spinning and <b>doubling</b> <b>sewing</b> cotton firm. In 1895 the executors of Lingard and Cruttenden sold the mill to Ward Brothers, hatters.|$|R

50|$|A <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> is {{the closure}} between a can {{body and a}} can end (or lid).|$|R
50|$|Invented in 1888 by Max Ams, modern <b>double</b> <b>seams</b> {{provide an}} {{airtight}} seal to the tin can. This airtight nature {{is crucial to}} keeping micro-organisms out of the can and keeping its contents sealed inside. Thus, <b>double</b> <b>seamed</b> cans are also known as Sanitary Cans. Developed in 1900 in Europe, this sort of can {{was made of the}} traditional cylindrical body made with tin plate. The two ends (lids) were attached using what is now called a <b>double</b> <b>seam.</b> A can thus sealed is impervious to contamination by creating two tight continuous folds between the can's cylindrical body and the lids. This eliminated the need for solder and allowed improvements in manufacturing speed, reducing cost.|$|R
50|$|The FDA {{continues}} by {{detailing the}} requirements of <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> destructive testing:"The <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> teardown examination is a destructive test. Tools {{that are used to}} perform this test include a seam micrometer, countersink gauge can opener and nippers. Optional equipment for seam teardown examinations include a seam saw, seam projector and seam scope. Although it is not imperative the investigator carry this equipment to each LACF inspection, {{it is very important that}} they know how to operate this equipment and read measurements from the micrometer, seam projector or seam scope. It is also important that the investigator know how to determine the tightness or wrinkle rating of the cover hook. Knowledge of the procedures used to perform <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> teardown examination are essential to evaluating the firm's knowledge and ability to do this examination. Attachment 14 explains the procedure for using a seam projector for examining a cross section of the seam. Attachment 15 explains the can seam micrometer and procedure for use, and Attachment 16 explains the use of a seamscope for the same exam.|$|R

50|$|Sedgewick New Mill, was {{an unusually}} narrow five-storey L shaped mill by A. H. Stott, {{designed}} for <b>doubling</b> <b>sewing</b> thread. It was Stott's second commission and neither party {{were satisfied with}} the result. McConnel became part of the Fine Spinners' and Doublers' Association Limited in 1898. Paragon Mill and New Old Mill were built in the Edwardian Baroque style by H. S. Porter using Accrington brick and terracotta. They had cast iron columns supporting transverse steel beams and reinforced concrete floors. Initially they were built with five-storeys and nine bays but a sixth storey was added later. The machinery was electrically driven and a new electricity substation was built in 1915. At the same time, Sedgewick New Mill and Long Mill were virtually rebuilt to take heavier equipment (usually this meant ring spinning frames).|$|R
5000|$|The <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> is {{made using}} a double seamer, which can {{have just one}} or a number of heads or <b>seaming</b> stations. The <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> is formed by {{mechanically}} interlocking five layers of material together: three layers of the can end and two layers of the can body. Each seaming head typically consists of two rolls, a first operation roll and second operation roll, and a chuck. Some seaming machines have two first operation rolls and two second operation rolls and a few machines use a method called [...] "rail seaming" [...] which requires no rolls. During the seaming operation, the can end is lowered on to the filled can body and held down by the chuck, which acts as an anvil to the seaming operation. The first operation roll then engages the can end against the can body thereby folding the end curl around the flange of the body. In some seaming machines, this is done as the can is turning at high speed. In other seaming machines, the can is stationary and the first operation roll (or rolls) spins around several times to ensure a complete first operation. After the first operation is complete, the first operation roll disengages from the can and the second operation roll then engages the can. The purpose of the second operation is to iron out the <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> into its final shape and remove the voids between the layers of can and end material. In practice, ironing {{out all of the}} can and end material in a <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> without leaving some voids is impossible without the use of a sealing compound.|$|R

50|$|Incorrect setups can be non-intuitive. For example, {{due to the}} {{springback}} effect, a seam {{can appear}} loose, when in reality it was closed too tight and has opened up like a spring.
