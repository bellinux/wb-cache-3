40|$|Criticism {{regarding}} the objectivity of <b>photographic</b> <b>evidence</b> when used during judicial hearings {{is beginning to}} emerge within the forensic and scientific literature. The second coronial inquest into the death of Romuald Todd Zak is a case that highlights the dangers of <b>photographic</b> <b>evidence</b> when inappropriately used to support forensic evidence. The Western Australian State Coroner, Alastair Hope, was highly critical of evidence presented by forensic experts during the second inquest. This article examines Hope's findings and discusses issues associated with the interpretation and representation of <b>photographic</b> <b>evidence...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{ubiquity of}} modern {{smartphones}} means that nearly ev-eryone has {{easy access to}} a camera at all times. In {{the event of a}} crime, the <b>photographic</b> <b>evidence</b> that these cam-eras leave in a smartphone’s memory becomes vital pieces of digital evidence, and forensic investigators are tasked with recovering and analyzing this evidence. Unfortunately, few existing forensics tools are capable of systematically recov-ering and inspecting such in-memory <b>photographic</b> <b>evidence</b> produced by smartphone cameras. In this paper, we present VCR, a memory forensics technique which aims to fill this void by enabling the recovery of all <b>photographic</b> <b>evidence</b> produced by an Android device’s cameras. By leveraging key aspects of the Android framework, VCR extends existing memory forensics techniques to improve vendor-customized Android memory image analysis. Based on this, VCR tar-gets application-generic artifacts in an input memory image which allow <b>photographic</b> <b>evidence</b> to be collected no matter which application produced it. Further, VCR builds upon the Android framework’s existing image decoding logic to both automatically recover and render any located evidence. Our evaluation with commercially available smartphones shows that VCR is highly effective at recovering all forms of photo-graphic evidence produced by a variety of applications across several different Android platforms...|$|R
