We have conducted a comprehensive study of highly siderophile element (HSE) concentrations in <b>picrites</b> from the ca. 260 Ma Emeishan large igneous province. We show that HSE abundances in the Emeishan <b>picrites</b> are greater than those in mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) and parental melts of Hawaiian <b>picrites,</b> but are similar to those in komatiites.

Using the compositions of olivine phenocrysts and relations between MgO and FeO, Al 2 O 3 and Ni, we estimated compositions of parental liquids and the proportion of accumulated olivine in each rock. <b>Picrites</b> from Curaçao formed mainly from a liquid with 12 wt. % MgO and they contain up to 55 wt. % excess olivine in the form of phenocrysts. A small proportion of more forsterite-rich olivine grains are xenocrysts from a more magnesian source. <b>Picrites</b> from Iceland formed from a slightly less magnesian liquid but one with also about 12 wt. % MgO and they contain both olivine and plagioclase in the accumulated assemblage. <b>Picrites</b> from the Greenland volcanic margin formed from a liquid that was distinctly more magnesian, with up to 20 wt. % MgO. In some of these rocks the proportion of accumulated olivine was minimal and in these the whole-rock composition is roughly equivalent to the liquid composition. The <b>picrites</b> from the three areas formed under different conditions and through contrasting melting processes. The Curaçao <b>picrites</b> derive from pooled liquids formed through moderate degrees of melting at moderate depths beneath a relatively old and thick oceanic lithosphere.

These high values, measured during gas extraction by crushing in vacuum, {{are similar to}} the highest magmatic 3 He= 4 He ratios found in young terrestrial volcanic rocks. By analogy with young basalts, in which crushing selectively extracts magmatic helium, any significant cos-mogenic 3 He appears to be absent in these <b>picrites.</b> Additional evidence for the absence of cosmogenic helium is provided by fusion results on the crushed olivine powders and by a single stepwise crushing experiment, in which only magmatic and radiogenic helium components are resolvable. The West Greenland <b>picrites</b> have Pb, Nd and Sr isotope compositions which overlap those found in <b>picrites</b> from Iceland and in basalts from Loihi Seamount, localities which today also have high 3 He= 4 He ratios. Isotopic variations in He, Pb, Nd and Sr for the West Greenland <b>picrites</b> are interpreted to largely result from interaction of the early Iceland mantle plume with the upper mantle during plume ascent and dispersion beneath the continental lithosphere. The presence of high 3 He= 4 He ratios in West Greenland, and the onset of magmatism across the North Atlantic Volcanic Province near 62 Ma, supports the hypothesis for very rapid dispersion (> 1 m=year) of mantle plume head material during the earliest stages of plume impact, as predicted in recent numerical simulations of plume be...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} study of the geochemistry of a new suite of early Iceland plume <b>picrites</b> shows that extremely high 3 He/ 4 He ratios (up to 50 R a) are found in <b>picrites</b> from Baffin Island and West Greenland. High 3 He/ 4 He <b>picrites</b> display a wide range in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (0. 70288 – 0. 70403), 143 Nd/ 144 Nd (0. 51288 – 0. 51308) and incompatible trace element ratios (e. g. La/Sm n = 0. 5 – 1. 6). These overlap the complete range of compositions of mid-ocean ridge basalts and most northern hemisphere ocean island basalts, including Iceland. Crustal contamination modelling in which high-grade Proterozoic crustal basement rocks for the region are mixed with a depleted parent cannot account for the trend displayed by the Baffin Island and West Greenland <b>picrites.</b> This rules {{out the possibility that}} the incompatible trace element, Sr and Nd isotope range of the high 3 He/ 4 He <b>picrites</b> is due to crustal contamination. The compositional range at high 3 He/ 4 He is also inconsistent with derivation from a primordial-He-rich reservoir that is a residue of ancient mantle depletion. This implies that the composition of the high 3 He/ 4 He mantle cannot be determined simply by extrapolating ocean island basalt He–Sr–Nd–Pb–Os isotope data. The apparent decoupling of He from trace element and lithophile radiogenic isotope tracers is difficult to attain by simple mixing of a high-[He], high 3 He/ 4 He reservoir with various depleted and enriched He-poor mantle reservoirs. The possibility that primordial He has diffused into a reservoir with a composition typical of convecting upper mantle cannot be ruled out.

40|$|Identifying the Os isotope {{composition}} of the prevalent, largely peridotitic, convecting mantle places important constraints on the Earth's accretion, differentiation and evolution and also has implications for the interpretation of Re-depletion ages in mantle peridotites. As partial melting preferentially samples mantle components with the lowest melting temperatures, large degree melts such as <b>picrites</b> should most closely reflect the peridotitic components within the source.

40|$|The 62 million {{year old}} lava flows of Baffin Island and West Greenland {{represent}} the earliest phase of magmatism in the North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP). These picritic lavas are characterised by high magnesium contents owing to their {{high proportion of}} olivine crystals. The parental magmas for the <b>picrites</b> {{are likely to have}} accumulated olivine crystals on their transit through the lithosphere and crust. Debate over the origin of accumulated crystals in the lavas results in uncertainty in the temperature and composition of the parental magmas for the early NAIP. The magnesium-rich olivine crystals (up to Fo 93) in the <b>picrites</b> of this study are shown not to have a xenocrystic origin. The samples, therefore, support the inference of high potential temperatures for the Baffin Island-West Greenland magmas, ~ 200 oC above ambient mantle. The <b>picrites</b> of Baffin Island and West Greenland display the highest terrestrial magmatic 3 He/ 4 He (up to 50 Ra, where Ra is the atmospheric value 1. 39 x 10 - 6), values that are considerably higher than the highest 3 He/ 4 He in contemporary ocean island basalts, which reach a maximum of ~ 30 Ra. High 3 He/ 4 He in Baffin Island and West Greenland are associated {{with a wide range of}} incompatible trace element and lithophile radiogenic isotopic compositions, not dissimilar to the range of compositions displayed by lavas at mid-ocean ridges, and overlapping the range displayed by most northern hemisphere ocean island basalts. Crustal contamination modelling in which high-grade Proterozoic crustal basement rocks are mixed with depleted parents cannot account for the compositional trends displayed by the <b>picrites.</b> Major and trace element compositions were determined on melt inclusions in high- 3 He/ 4 He <b>picrites</b> that span a wide range of whole-rock incompatible trace element and radiogenic isotopic compositions. The melt inclusions support the findings from the whole-rock study since melt inclusion compositions reflect the composition of their associated whole-rock, with no anomalous compositions present. In addition, there is no evidence for a contribution of a proportion of depleted melts to the source of the relatively enriched whole-rock samples. Therefore, since all melt inclusions were contained within high- 3 He/ 4 He samples, it is shown that high 3 He/ 4 He is a feature of both depleted and relatively enriched melt compositions. The wide range in whole-rock compositions of the Baffin Island and West Greenland <b>picrites</b> represents that of the sub-lithospheric mantle source region and is inconsistent with derivation of the <b>picrites</b> from residues of ancient mantle depletion. The apparent decoupling of helium from trace elements and radiogenic isotopes is hard to reconcile with simple mixing of a high-helium concentration, high- 3 He/ 4 He reservoir with various depleted and enriched helium-poor mantle reservoirs. It is possible that primordial helium has diffused into a reservoir with a composition similar to that of the convecting upper mantle. However, this must have occurred after the development of existing mantle heterogeneity. The high- 3 He/ 4 He <b>picrites</b> require the existence of a deep, primordial helium-rich reservoir. Whether this reservoir is present in the upper or deep mantle, or even the core, remains uncertain. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The Zhubu magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE sulfide deposit is hosted in a mafic-ultramafic {{intrusion}} {{which is}} part of the Emeishan large igneous province in southwest China. The Zhubu intrusion is composed of a layered sequence (750 × 400 × 600 m) with subhorizontal modal layering and a subvertical marginal zone of < 40 m across. The marginal zone is composed of lherzolite and olivine websterite with minor gabbroic rocks. The layered sequence is composed of lherzolite, websterite, gabbro, and gabbrodiorite from the base to the top. The Zhubu intrusion can be explained by two stages of formation, an early conduit stage for the marginal zone and a late in situ differentiation stage for the layered sequence. Most important Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization in the intrusion occurs as disseminated sulfides within the marginal zone. Olivine crystals from the marginal zone contain 81 to 84 mol % Fo and 1, 600 to 1, 900 ppm Ni.

This diagram places the Lapland rocks in the fields of Ti-enriched komatiites and <b>picrites.</b> Komatiitic rocks are depleted in both light and heavy rare earth elements (LREE and HREE) relative to middle REE (MREE) and possess relatively high TiO 2 even in the most LREE-depleted varieties, whereas picritic rocks approach geochemically Hawaiian <b>picrites.</b> Seven clinopyroxene and whole-rock pairs analysed for Sm Nd isotopes yield an average age of 2056 +/- 25 Ma for the komatiites.

However, linear trends in Pb isotopic compositions in the studied samples reflect involvement of a component with lower 206 Pb/ 204 Pb and 208 Pb/ 204 Pb than that inferred for the enriched Kerguelen plume. Contamination of the MgO-rich magmas by the Kerguelen Plateau cannot account for the observed Hf-Pb-Sr-Nd isotopic variations.

Olivine-liquid FeO-MgO equilibria have been used to backtrack to calculated parental compositions, giving as much as 20. 2 % MgO in the melt, and to estimate eruptive temperatures for them of close to 1500 °C. Crystallization histories, however, indicate that these <b>picrites</b> are hybrids between olivine-charged crystal sludges and differentiated magmas that followed a low-pressure olivine-plagioclase-clinopyroxene cotectic during differentiation. The glasses give eruptive T = 1170 - 1220 °C. Much of the olivine in the rocks, especially the very magnesian olivine (Fo 92 - 93), was incorporated by magma mixing and likely scavenging of minerals from mantle wall rock. The rocks are thus hybrids and the olivine in them neither lies along a single olivine-controlled liquid line of descent, nor can it be linked to the host compositions, which are too high in iron. Therefore they are unsuitable for the backtrack procedure.
