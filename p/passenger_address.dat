50|$|In 1985, a new {{generation}} of advanced suburban passenger train was being considered by the State Rail Authority. There was a delay in the construction of these trains, and 56 interim stainless steel air conditioned cars, C3581-3608 and T4247-4274, were built by Goninan, known as the 'Chopper Cars' for their chopper control. These cars trialled several features of the next generation cars, such as fixed seating, door chimes and <b>passenger</b> <b>address</b> systems. They were originally fitted with a push-button feature, to enable passengers to open the doors manually, but this feature was short-lived. They retained the flat ends of the previous Goninan cars, but {{with the addition of a}} fibreglass moulded end piece which was originally white with orange and red stripes (the 'candy' State Rail livery). These ends were later painted grey with a lower yellow section which they retain to this day, and internally the standard grey livery and blue seat upholstery was applied. These cars continue to operate as C sets.|$|E

5000|$|A given <b>passenger's</b> <b>address</b> in {{this system}} would be {{infinite}} in length, corresponding to a decimal form {{of one of the}} real numbers ranging from 0 (address 0-0-0...) to 1 (address 9-9-9...). Exactly one guest would have the address corresponding to one-sixth (1-6-6-6...), for example, and another to the value of pi minus three (1-4-1-5...). (Real numbers that have terminating decimal expansions, like 3/8 = [...]375, actually correspond to two passengers, one with an address ending in an infinite string of zeroes, the other ending in an infinite string of nines. For example, 3/8 = [...]375000... = [...]374999... corresponds both to the <b>passenger</b> with <b>address</b> 3-7-5-0-0-0... and to the <b>passenger</b> with <b>address</b> 3-7-4-9-9-9...) The set of real numbers, and the set of guests in this example, is uncountably infinite. Because no one-to-one pairing can be made between countable and uncountable sets, rooms at the hotel cannot be made for all of these guests, although any countably infinite subset of them can still be accommodated — for example, the set of guests whose addresses terminate in an infinitely repeating sequence, corresponding to a rational number.|$|R

The Regulation n. 1177 / 2010 aims to establish minimum rules on information for all maritime <b>passengers,</b> <b>addressing</b> issues such as interruptions of journeys, the rules to be observed in the event of delays and in dealing with complaints and regulates how to provide assistance for persons with reduced mobility.

The fellow <b>passenger</b> <b>addressed</b> himself to these new-comers, and they all began to smile good-naturedly. Then the fellow-passenger--he was stout and fifty and had a brilliant striped rug always over his knees--pointed out the Buddha-like position of Angus, and the three in-starers smiled again. And so the fellow-passenger thought he must try too. So he put aside his rug, and lifted his feet from the floor, and took his toes in his hands, and tried to bring his legs up and his feet under him. But his knees were fat, his trousers in the direst extreme of peril, and he could no more manage it than if he had tried to swallow himself. So he desisted suddenly, rather scared, whilst the three bunched and official heads in the doorway laughed and jested at him, showing their teeth and teasing him. But on our gypsy party they turned their eyes with admiration. They loved the novelty and the fun. And on the thin, elegant Angus in his new London clothes, they looked really puzzled, as he sat there immobile, gleaming through his monocle like some Buddha going wicked, perched cross-legged and ecstatic on the red velvet seat. They marvelled that the lower half of him could so double up, like a foot-rule. So they stared till they had seen enough. When they suddenly said [...] "Buon 'appetito," [...] withdrew their heads and shoulders, slammed the door, and departed.|$|R

The emerging dualism of the constructs is important to consider, particularly since the social aspects were stressed as being travel quality prerequisites.

40|$|Abstract: Air data probes provide {{essential}} sensing {{capabilities to}} aircraft. The loss or corruption of air data measurements due to sensor faults jeopardizes an aircraft and its <b>passengers.</b> To <b>address</b> such faults, sensor hardware redundancy is typically {{combined with a}} voting system to detect and discard erroneous measurements. This approach relies on redundancy, which may lead to unacceptable increases in system weight and cost. This paper presents an alternative, model-based approach to fault detection for a non-redundant air data system. The model-based fault detection strategy uses robust linear filtering methods to reject exogenous disturbances, e. g. wind, and provide robustness to model errors. The proposed algorithm is applied to NASA’s Generic Transport Model aircraft with an air data system modeled based on manufacturer data provided by Goodrich Corporation. The fault detection filters are designed using linearized models at one flight condition. The detection performance is evaluated at a particular reference flight condition using linear analysis and nonlinear simulations...|$|R

40|$|This study assesses current {{needs in}} the {{implementation}} of Real-Time Transit Information Systems. Web surveys are used to better understand information supply and demand, defined as the attitudes and experiences with real-time information of transit passengers and agencies, respectively. The most valued types of information demanded were found to be related to vehicle location while the least valued information relates to vehicle characteristics, like seating availability. Smartphone applications were found to be the preferred medium for receiving information followed by Internet/websites and dynamic message signs. The surveys also revealed that demographic and socioeconomic status influence preferences for real-time information. The information supply survey found that approximately 70 percent of surveyed agencies currently offer real-time information. The largest constraint to providing or improving Real-Time Transit Information Systems (RTTISs) was found to be funding, followed by staffing needs. A comparison between the survey results found that the information currently being provided by transit agencies is mostly in line with the information most valued by transit passengers. The few differences that exist are generally because agencies do not provide information on the media preferred most by <b>passengers.</b> To <b>address</b> these differences, several suggestions are made to improve the implementation of real-time information. This information can be used to better develop and prioritize investment in real-time information systems...|$|R
