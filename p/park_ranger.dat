5|$|Black also learns of {{the murder}} in Maryland, and connects it to the killings of four {{other women in the}} locale. Ignoring the protestations of his wife, Black leaves to {{investigate}} the parkland where one of the earlier bodies was uncovered. A <b>park</b> <b>ranger</b> discusses that case with him, telling Black that the body was found by an unidentified rambler. Black believes this man was the murderer. Elsewhere, Dion returns home, where he is belittled and emasculated by his overbearing mother, Marie (Linda Sorensen).|$|E
5|$|Later, at FBI headquarters, Fox Mulder shows Dana Scully a {{photo of}} the missing loggers, telling her that another group of loggers {{disappeared}} in the forest in 1934. The two agents head to the forest, where they meet <b>Park</b> <b>Ranger</b> Larry Moore and Steve Humphreys, head of security for the logging company. While driving through the forest, their truck hits caltrops left in the ground by eco-terrorists, forcing them to walk the rest of the way. Upon arriving at the camp site, Mulder and Scully find the cabins abandoned and the communication equipment destroyed. Searching the forest, they find a corpse encased in a large cocoon hanging from a tree.|$|E

50|$|<b>Park</b> <b>Rangers</b> are full-authority law {{enforcement}} officers while they are on State Park lands. Under state law <b>Park</b> <b>Rangers</b> {{are considered to be}} limited authority {{law enforcement}} officers since their law enforcement authority is only applicable on lands owned by State <b>Parks.</b> <b>Park</b> <b>Rangers</b> attend either the Parks Law Enforcement Academy (PLEA) held each winter at Skagit Valley Community College or the Basic Law Enforcement Academy (BLEA) at the Criminal Justice Training Center. <b>Park</b> <b>Rangers</b> are usually dispatched by the Washington State Patrol.|$|R
5|$|The area is {{populated}} with white-tailed deer, grouse and raccoon. The deer population, which was extirpated by 1895, has rebounded since re-introduction by <b>park</b> <b>ranger</b> Arthur Woody during the 1930s. Over 100 {{species of birds}} inhabit or migrate through the area, including native songbirds such as the Canada warbler, Blackburnian, black-throated blue, black-throated green and chestnut-sided warblers. Also found are hawks, owls, woodpeckers, kinglets, thrushes, vireos, cuckoos, phoebes, chickadees, titmice, nuthatches, brown creepers, wrens, tanagers, grosbeaks, indigo buntings and red crossbills. Migratory species are present during the late spring and early fall, making the area popular among birdwatchers The creeks surrounding the lake are rich with species of salamanders.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Mulder calls Scully to come bail him out. Afterwards, Scully brings Mulder to {{meet with}} Dr. Diamond, a {{professor}} of anthropology at the University of Maryland, before going on a date with Rob. The local <b>park</b> <b>ranger</b> contacts Mulder after finding the corpse of a wild man in the woods who he believes could be the Jersey Devil. Scully and Mulder bring the ranger and Dr. Diamond to the morgue, where the body has mysteriously vanished. Mulder believes that the Jersey Devil they are hunting is actually the creature's mate who has headed into Atlantic City in search of food after her mate's death. The agents, along with the ranger and Dr. Diamond, search for the creature in an abandoned building. While they are searching the building, Detective Thompson arrives with a SWAT team.|$|E
5|$|Douglas' cottage, {{located in}} Coconut Grove at 37443754 Stewart Avenue, {{was built in}} 1924. She wrote all of her major books and stories in the cottage, and the City of Miami {{designated}} it an historic site in 1995, {{not only for its}} famous owner but also for its unique Masonry Vernacular architecture. After Douglas' death, Friends of the Everglades proposed making the house part of an education center about Douglas and her life, but neighbors protested, citing issues with parking, traffic, and an influx of visitors to the quiet neighborhood. The house, which had an exterior floodwater line from the 1926 Miami Hurricane and some damage from an infestation of bees, had fallen further into disrepair. For a while, the idea of moving the house to Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in Coral Gables, which Douglas helped to develop and where there is a life size bronze statue to commemorate her efforts, was considered. The State of Florida owns Douglas' house and in April 2007 placed it in the care of the Florida Park Service, a division of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Restoration of the floors and counters took place in the following months. Water service was reconnected to the house and the electrical system was updated for safety purposes. All work was approved by the Department of Historic Resources. A <b>park</b> <b>ranger</b> was placed as a resident in the Douglas house to help maintain the structure and property.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{parks in}} the Democratic Republic of the Congo are {{insecure}} areas restricting the access of <b>park</b> <b>rangers.</b> Although <b>park</b> <b>rangers</b> are trained to stop illegal hunting, {{the small number of}} <b>park</b> <b>rangers</b> {{do not have access to}} further training or equipment to handle the militia groups. In the Virunga National Park, for example, 190 <b>park</b> <b>rangers</b> have been killed in just the past 15 years from civil war. Laws in place enforce trans-boundary collaboration and have been proven successful in reducing the decline of the eastern lowland gorilla [...] Illegal extraction of resources from the Virunga National Park has been reduced by policing transportation across borders. This has reduced the financial input available to the militias in the region. Although <b>park</b> <b>rangers</b> have been successful in restricting the amount of illegal resources being transported out of the region, militias groups have retaliated by purposely killing a group of gorillas to threaten the <b>park</b> <b>rangers.</b> On July 22, 2007, 10 gorillas were killed in retaliation for the park rangers' interference with the exportation of illegal resources such as wood.|$|R
5|$|The first soldier cabins {{were built}} in 1886 as part of Camp Sheridan {{and all of these}} were later removed. Cabins were also built at the Lower Geyser Basin, Upper Geyser Basin, Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, Riverside and at Soda Butte. As more {{outposts}} were needed over the years cabins were constructed at Lake Outlet (1887), Snake River (Polecat Creek), West Thumb and Riverside (1892), Mud Geyser (1895), Norris and Thumb Bay (1897), Lake (1899), Snake River (1902), Gardiner (1903), West Thumb, Syvan Pass and Soda Butte (1904), Tower (1907), Crevice Mountain (1912), Snake River (1914), and Aster Creek, Cabin Creek, Harebell, and Thorofare (1915). Snowshoe cabins in existence in 1899 included small structures at Astringent Creek, Bartlet, Boundary Creek, Coulter Creek, Hellroaring Creek, Lewis River, Park Point, Proposition, Trappers Creek, Trout Creek and Willow Creek. While none of the aforementioned structures are still in existence, four remote structures remain. They include the Buffalo Lake snowshoe cabin (Bldg 234) and the Norris and Bechler River soldier stations (Bldgs 111 and 231). The Norris soldier station currently houses the Museum of the National <b>Park</b> <b>Ranger.</b> Additionally, the Bechler River barn (Bldg 232) is still in existence.|$|E
5|$|While Yellowstone {{was under}} army management, the activities, {{policies}} and procedures developed served as precedents for other national parks and subsequent actions by the National Park Service after its formation in 1916. The army solved {{a wide variety of}} problems and developed procedures covering a multitude of administrative issues. The military superintendents continued the evolution of park policies and conservation measures initiated by the first civilian administrators. They implemented backcountry patrols, access improvement, wildlife protection and management, protection of natural features, law enforcement and development of a ranger force. The army set precedents for future headquarters area development designs, visitor services such as educational outreach and interpretive tours. Their diligence in dealing with poachers led to legislation that provided for prosecution and punishment of illegal activity. That most of the precedents that the army established were incorporated later by the National Park Service is a lasting legacy of the important role the army played in U.S. national park history. Modern <b>Park</b> <b>Ranger</b> uniforms are legacies of army management of the park. Most iconically, the campaign hat, a flat-brow peaked hat worn by the cavalry {{in the last years of}} army management is nearly identical to the modern hats worn into the 21stcentury.|$|E

5000|$|The City of Los Angeles <b>Park</b> <b>Rangers</b> {{provides}} {{public assistance}} and emergency services in Los Angeles City parks, including first aid, park policing, search and rescue, and are trained wildland firefighters. They have various responsibilities in public parks and provide not only emergency and public safety services but also informational services at several <b>parks.</b> <b>Park</b> <b>rangers</b> receive law enforcement training and have certified peace officer status in California. All <b>Park</b> <b>Rangers</b> {{are required to}} obtain a Basic P.O.S.T certificate to remain employed. <b>Park</b> <b>Rangers</b> attend the Los Angeles Police Departments academy. The Ranger Division is a participating agency in P.O.S.T which sets the standards of training for peace officers. In 1996 due to spikes in violent crime in city parks patrolled by the Rangers, the union representing the rangers requested that the Rangers be trained to carry semi-automatic handguns similar to the Police but the request was eventually denied due to opposition from the LAPD and the Parks Department. [...] In 2000 the Parks and Recreation Department and the LAPD attempted to change {{the duties of the}} <b>Park</b> <b>rangers</b> by signing an agreement that would make the LAPD responsible for all arrests made in city <b>parks</b> and that <b>Rangers</b> would only be allowed to make arrests if someone's life was in danger.
