40|$|The {{football}} in Sweden activates {{hundreds of thousands}} of children and youngsters every week wherevolunteer coaches are responsible for the activities. On these occasions, the youth sports coaches havethe opportunity to give children and young people a positive experience of football and physical activity,which hopefully evolves into a lifelong interest. For the youth sports coaches to be able to offerdevelopment and fun football activity, it becomes apparent that football clubs have a great responsibility. The clubs should support and create good conditions for the youth sports coaches in their role. Sportclubs management of volunteer workers appears to be major deficiencies, and leadership developmentstrategies are often lacking. In this study, specific clubs have been chosen as good examples of how towork with recruitment, education and development for youth coaches. The {{purpose of the study was}} toinvestigate the strategies the clubs work with in recruiting, retaining and developing their youth sportscoaches, as well how they are expressed in the clubs operation plans and policy documents. The datacollection was done with analyzes of the clubs <b>programme</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> and policy documents, as wellas interviews with board members and the person who has education responsibility in each clubs. Theconclusions of the study are, in general, that the clubs have conscious and similar strategies forrecruitment, education and developing youth coaches. In the clubs they have clearly set goals andguidelines. They also have mentoring, projects, education and social meetings with the coaches. Byhighlighting the good clubs strategies, there is a possibility that other football clubs can be inspired bytheir work and that more clubs take greater responsibility towards their youth coaches. The report endswith a final discussion with suggestions on how the clubs can continue to work with education anddevelopment...|$|E

Also according to the investigation, one important contributor to the accident was inadequate guidelines for critical tests and operations”. (Pires and Mosleh 2011) Over the recent past, the accumulation of major mishaps, crises and accidents {{have made it clear}} that organisations must still improve their capabilities to address safety “not as a stand-alone activity that is separate from the main activities and processes of the organization” but as an integrated part of total performance management. The requirements for safety management in existing and upcoming standards and regulations, as for example the ISO 31000 and or the Seveso II directive, call for a proactive strategic approach, anticipating risks and demonstrating a capacity to keep safety at the centre of changes driven by commercial competition, and ensuring that safety evidence itself becomes an effective driver of change. However there is often a gap between the state principles and an actual roadmap to their implementation. Furthermore organisations, especially the one dealing with safety critical operations, find it difficult to integrate their different functional units in a common <b>programme</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> management or change; there is no clear consensus about what it means to be ‘proactive’; there is no integrated framework for analysing or managing all the human related functions in an operational system. Innovation may rely on assembling the best practices, tools and methods already available for functional analysis, risk assessment, interactive emergency scenarios analysis, performance monitoring, design review, training and knowledge management, in an integrated framework able to address safety management in the main aspects of a product or process lifecycle the cornerstone of which is the building of a common operational picture to support the capacity to perform more participatory and dynamic risk identification and solutions loops in: - Design (new plants, processes /procedures availing new visualization tools) - Ad hoc critical activities (management of change or scheduled overhaul) - Operations management (establishing of dynamic risk registers). This is the scope of a new EU funded research project called TOSCA and the present paper will introduce the current framework being built...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{article is}} about the {{development}} of community radio in Indonesia, it is problems and solutions. Community radio in Indonesia developed as an alternative to both public radio and commercial radio after the fall of Soeharto in 1998. Two important features of community radio are that it provides all community members with equal access to information, enhancing their rights and obligations, access to justice, public accountability and also enables them to participate actively in radio management and production. Both features enhance peopleâ€™s selfawareness and sense of belonging to a community. The expansion of the progressive, participatory, community ownership, and non-profit model of community radio, has become a third sector of communication beside the commercial or state media. The dynamic development of community radio in Indonesia faced several problems starting from it is definition, implementation of regulation until standards <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> <b>operation</b> based on the concept of community approach and participatio...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} anaerobic thermophilic {{sludge digestion}} (55 °C) in a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) on a pilot-plant scale (150 L). The experimental protocol was defined {{to examine the}} effect of the increase in the organic loading rate on the efficiency of the digester and to report on its steady-state performance. The reactor was subjected to a <b>programme</b> <b>of</b> steady-state <b>operation</b> over a range of solids retention times (SRTs) of 75, 40, 27, 20 and 15 days and organic loading rates (OLR) in the range 0. 4 – 2. 2 kg VS/(m 3 day). The digester was fed with raw sludge (containing approximately 35 kg/m 3 volatile solids (VS)) once daily during the 75 -day SRT period, twice daily during the 40 -day SRT period and three times a day during the 27 -, 20 - and 15 -day SRT periods. The reactor was initially operated with an organic loading rate of 0. 4 kg VS/(m 3 day) and an SRT of 75 days. The volatile solids removal efficiency in the reactor was found to be 73 %, while the volumetric methane production rate produced in the digester reached 0. 02 m 3 /(m 3 day). Over a 338 -day operating period, an OLR of 2. 2 kg VS/(m 3 day) was achieved with 49. 1 % VS removal efficiency in the pilot sludge digester, at which time the volumetric methane production rate content of biogas produced in the digester reached 0. 4 m 3 /(m 3 day). The chemical oxygen demand (COD) mass balance obtained indicated that COD used for methane generation increased when the SRT was decreased or when the influent organic loading rate was increased. This implies that the amount of COD used in the anabolism route decreased with SRT due the microbial population becoming adapted to new operational conditions and more COD being used to generate methane. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{prolonged}} period of strongly northward Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) on the high-latitude F-region is studied {{using data from the}} EISCAT Common <b>Programme</b> Zero mode <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> on 11 – 12 August 1982. The analysis of the raw autocorrelation functions is kept to the directly derived parameters Ne, Te, Ti and velocity, and limits are defined for the errors introduced by assumptions about ion composition and by changes in the transmitted power and system constant. Simple data-cleaning criteria are employed to eliminate problems due to coherent signals and large background noise levels. The observed variations in plasma densities, temperatures and velocities are interpreted in terms of supporting data from ISEE- 3 and local riometers and magnetometers. Both field-aligned and field-perpendicular plasma flows at Tromsø showed effects of the northward IMF: convection was slow and irregular and field-aligned flow profiles were characteristic of steady-state polar wind outflow with flux of order 1012 m− 2 s− 1. This period followed a strongly southward IMF which had triggered a substorm. The substorm gave enhanced convection, with a swing to equatorward flow and large (5 × 1012 m− 2 s− 1), steady-state field-aligned fluxes, leading to the possibility of O+ escape into the magnetosphere. The apparent influence of the IMF over both field-perpendicular and field-aligned flows is explained in terms of the cross-cap potential difference and the location of the auroral oval...|$|R
