40|$|The {{unemployment}} rate for adults age 65 and older reached 6. 8 percent in February 2009, {{the highest level}} recorded since the federal government began computing reliable {{unemployment rate}}s in 1948. About 433, 000 adults age 65 and older were {{out of work and}} actively seeking employment last month, {{more than twice as many}} as in November 2007, just before the recession began. Another 1. 3 million adults age 55 to 64 were unemployed in February, although the unemployment rate edged down last month for women age 55 to 64. Senior unemployment rates were particularly high among African Americans, Hispanics, those who did not complete high school, and those in the construction, manufacturing, and leisure and hospitality industries. Unemployment Rates Surge for Workers Age 65 and Older • The unemployment rate for men age 65 and older increased to 7. 6 <b>percent</b> <b>last</b> <b>month,</b> its highest level since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began using the Current Population Survey in 1948 to track joblessness (figure 1). The unemployment rate for women age 65 and older increased to 5. 8 percent, the highest rate since July 1992. Compared with past recessions, more older men are now remaining in the labor force as job prospects deteriorate. With the slumping stock market eroding retirement accounts, few workers can afford to retire early. Between November 2007 and February 2009, the share of men age 6...|$|E
30|$|Beginning at 17.5 percent, the {{standard}} VAT rate was temporarily cut to 15.0 <b>percent</b> for the <b>last</b> <b>month</b> of 2008 {{and the entire}} calendar year of 2009.13 It was 17.5 percent again in 2010. On January 4, 2011, the rate was permanently increased to 20 percent where it is now. The UK VAT increases are especially interesting {{for the purposes of}} labor market analysis because a VAT reduces the purchasing power of wages without reducing the purchasing power of jobless benefits because the latter are indexed to the consumer price index (CPI).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{utilizes}} {{a unique}} micro data set on consumer durables {{to study the}} effect of consumption tax reforms on the time path of consumption. The dataset reports the monthly sales of individual products and their consumer prices in 22 European countries, which enacted numerous consumption tax reforms in recent years. We implement a reduced form specification for sales {{that allows us to}} test theoretical predictions by a standard inter-temporal model of consumer choice under different assumptions about the pass-through of taxes into prices. Our identification strategy exploits the trading of individual products in multiple countries. The results document that changes in baseline consumption tax rates are fully and quickly shifted into consumer prices and exert very strong effects on the time path of consumption. We find that a one percentage point increase in consumption taxes causes an inter-temporal shift in consumption by 3 or more percent. In addition, purchases of durable goods increase temporarily by about 2 <b>percent</b> in the <b>last</b> <b>month</b> before a tax increase...|$|R

The government imposed a wage freeze on public sector unions in February 2004 {{as part of its}} effort to rein in inflation. But after prices surged 13 <b>percent</b> in <b>last</b> 10 <b>months</b> of 2004, BITU announced it was pulling out of the [...] "Memorandum of Understanding" [...] (MoU, the government's collective bargaining agreement with public-sector unions). JALGO General-Secretary Davis-Whyte refused to withdraw from the MoU, helping save the agreement and leading to improved relations with the government. In 2006, the Patterson administration announced it was ending a wage freeze implemented in the MoU. Davis-Whyte was named to a trade union body (which included representatives from the Jamaica Teachers' Association and Jamaica Civil Service Association) to negotiate the next MoU. But six months later, JALGO and two other public employee unions were forced to strike the National Water Commission to increase salaries (which averaged 28 percent below market).|$|R
