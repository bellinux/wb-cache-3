25|$|Some {{pet owners}} have become {{concerned}} over {{the safety of}} all processed <b>pet</b> <b>foods,</b> and have chosen to forgo store-bought prepared <b>pet</b> <b>foods</b> in favor of preparing food from ingredients at home. The popularity of books on home preparation of <b>pet</b> <b>foods</b> has rocketed on Amazon.com.

5|$|Friskies is {{produced}} and marketed by Nestlé Purina Petcare, {{a subsidiary of}} Nestlé. Friskies was first introduced in the 1930s by Carnation through its subsidiary, Albers Company. By 1973, Friskies was one of five companies that controlled two-thirds of the $1.75 billion <b>pet</b> <b>food</b> market. At the time Carnation was known for dry milk products, but also had operations processing animal feed for farms. It experimented with dry food products for 3.5 years at Carnation Farms, initially with stray dogs in improvised cages, and later with pure-breds in a formal kennel. Carnation International was formed in 1966 to market Carnation's <b>pet</b> <b>food</b> products internationally in Japan, Spain, France, England and Italy, among others.|$|E

5|$|Friskies is a {{brand of}} wet and dry cat food and treats. It is owned by Nestlé Purina PetCare Company, a {{subsidiary}} of Nestlé. Friskies was initially introduced by Carnation Company in the 1930s as a dog food brand. When Friskies cat food {{was introduced in the}} 1950s, it was the first dry <b>pet</b> <b>food</b> product specifically for cats. The brand was acquired by Nestlé in 1985. From the 1970s to the 2000s, variations in Friskies cat food proliferated as the competition for consumer spending intensified.|$|E
5|$|The merger {{was opposed}} by {{consumer}} advocates, {{such as the}} Consumer Federation of America, due to anti-trust concerns. The two companies combined would become the largest <b>pet</b> <b>food</b> brand by market-share with a 45 {{percent share of the}} cat food market. The Federal Trade Commission approved the merger after the Meow Mix and Alley Cat brands from Ralston were sold to J.W. Childs Equity Partners, creating the separate Meow Mix Company. Ralston's St. Louis, Missouri location was chosen as the new company's North America headquarters.|$|E

5|$|Coyotes {{are often}} {{attracted}} to dog food and {{animals that are}} small enough to appear as prey. Items such as garbage, <b>pet</b> <b>food,</b> and sometimes feeding stations for birds and squirrels attract coyotes into backyards. About three to five pets attacked by coyotes are brought into the Animal Urgent Care hospital of South Orange County (California) each week, the majority of which are dogs, since cats typically do not survive the attacks. Scat analysis collected near Claremont, California, revealed that coyotes relied heavily on pets as a food source in winter and spring. At one location in Southern California, coyotes began relying on a colony of feral cats as a food source. Over time, the coyotes killed most of the cats, and then continued to eat the cat food placed daily at the colony site by people who were maintaining the cat colony.|$|E
5|$|The {{barndoor}} skate {{is one of}} five skates in the Gulf of Maine that has commercial value, but of those, the species that are most frequently targeted are the winter skate (Leucoraja ocellata) and the thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata). The {{barndoor skate}} is most commonly considered by-catch by commercial trawlers operating in the northwestern Atlantic that target other commercially valuable species of fish using bottom trawling. When harvested, the flesh of the barndoor skate is used as bait, fish meal, <b>pet</b> <b>food,</b> and the meat from its wings is sold for human consumption. Since 1981, landings of skates have increased substantially, partly in response to increased demand for lobster bait, and more significantly, to the increased export market for skate wings. Currently, commercial retention and sale of barndoor skate is prohibited in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Extrusion {{cooking is}} {{commonly}} used to produce dry <b>pet</b> <b>foods.</b> As a process involving heat treatment, extrusion cooking can have both beneficial and {{detrimental effects on the}} nutritional quality of the product. Desirable effects of extrusion comprise increase in palatability, destruction of undesirable nutritionally active factors and improvement in digestibility and utilisation of proteins and starch. Undesirable effects of extrusion include reduction of protein quality due to e. g. the Maillard reaction, decrease in palatability and loss of heat-labile vitamins. Effects of extrusion processing on the nutritional values of feeds for livestock have been well documented. Literature results concerning effects of extrusion on dry <b>pet</b> <b>foods,</b> however, are scarce. The present review discusses the results of studies investigating the impact of extrusion cooking on the nutritional quality of dry <b>pet</b> <b>foods...</b>|$|R
