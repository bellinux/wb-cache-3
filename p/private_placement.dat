40|$|This {{study is}} mainly to discuss whether private investors and {{ownership}} structure {{can affect the}} performance of <b>private</b> <b>placements</b> when public companies raise capital through <b>private</b> <b>placements</b> of common stocks. In private investors, this research uses the classification of private investors mentioned by Barclay et al. (2007) as our classification base, and divides the samples of <b>private</b> <b>placements</b> into three groups, including “managerial investors”, “active investors”, and “passive investors”. In addition, judge whether there is just one investor in <b>private</b> <b>placements.</b> And in ownership structure, there are the ratios of shares held by “directors”, “mangers”, and “major shareholders”, including the ratio of “the independent directors' seats in the board”. The amounts of samples are 104 consist of the research objects including 70 companies during the research period from 2002 to 2008. About the performance of <b>private</b> <b>placements,</b> <b>private</b> <b>placements</b> improve the performance. Besides, its better performance can last approximately for seven seasons. In addition, the performance through <b>private</b> <b>placements</b> for many times {{is better than the}} one through <b>private</b> <b>placements</b> for just once. About the private investors, if the top management teams invest in <b>private</b> <b>placements,</b> the growth ratio of the performance after <b>private</b> <b>placements</b> will become much better. About the ownership structure, the higher the ratio of shares held by the managers is, the worse the growth ratio of the performance after <b>private</b> <b>placements</b> is. Besides, the higher the ratio of shares held by the major shareholders is, the better the growth ratio of the performance after <b>private</b> <b>placements</b> is. Moreover, the higher the ratio of the independent directors' seats in the board, the worse the growth ratio of the performance after <b>private</b> <b>placements</b> is. 本研究主要探討台灣上市(櫃) 公司辦理普通股私募時，私募應募人與股權結構是否會影響私募績效。在私募應募人方面，本研究採用Barclay et al. (2007) 所提及之應募人分類方式，將私募樣本分為三類，即為管理私募、積極私募與消極私募，加上是否為單一應募人。而股權結構方面，分為董監事、經理人與大股東的持股比率，加上獨立董監事占董事會的比率。研究期間為 2002 年至 2008 年，研究對象共 70 間公司，樣本數達 104 筆。 在私募績效方面，私募可以帶來績效提升，且其較好的績效維持約七季；多次私募的績效高於單次私募的績效。在私募應募人方面，當高階管理階層在私募活動出資，可以使私募後績效成長率較好。而在股權結構部分，當經理人持股比率愈高，私募後績效成長率愈差；大股東持股比率愈高，私募後績效成長率愈好；獨立董監事比率愈高，私募後績效成長率愈差。第一章 緒論	 1 第一節 研究動機與目的	 1 第二節 研究流程	 3 第三節 論文架構	 4 第二章 文獻探討	 5 第一節 台灣有價證券私募相關法規	 5 第二節 國內外相關文獻	 9 第三章 研究方法	 14 第一節 研究樣本	 14 第二節 研究假說	 15 第三節 變數定義	 18 第四節 實證分析方法	 21 第四章 實證結果	 25 第一節 敘述性統計與相關分析	 25 第二節 辦理私募與公司績效之關係	 29 第三節 私募應募人與私募後績效之關係	 31 第四節 迴歸分析	 34 第五章 結論與建議	 40 參考文獻	 4...|$|R

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} bankruptcy, Rail Management {{established}} a new company, Ofotbanen Drift AS, {{to take over}} the estate in bankruptcy. They also stated that the cause of the bankruptcy was that Autolink had not let them make a <b>private</b> <b>placement</b> of NOK 10 million. The new company received an operation and safety licence from the inspectorate in January 2009, and plans to start operation again in February. On 9 April 2010, the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate withdrew Ofotbanen's operating certificate because it was not economically sound to operate. The company filed for bankruptcy in May, after the Norwegian Tax Administration could not claim NOK700,000 in due taxes.|$|E

The city engineer estimated it would need a subsidy of NOK2 million in 2006, and the politicians, who wanted the airport to run without subsidies, demanded that Vildanden guarantee for the deficit. This was rejected by Vildanden—on the contrary, the company was in dire need for more capital, and issued a <b>private</b> <b>placement</b> for NOK4 million in December 2005. The company had since the start been losing money, and needed extra capital to get through the rough until it could make an operating profit. After the placement, 15% of the company was owned by DAT, while Coast Air sold their shares. In 2005, Vildanden had a revenue of NOK15 million.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{asymmetric}} information model to examine <b>private</b> <b>placements</b> issued to owner-managers. Our main {{conclusion is that}} allowing <b>private</b> <b>placements</b> to insiders can mit- igate, if not eliminate, the underinvestment problem. Our model predicts that announcement period returns for <b>private</b> <b>placements</b> should be: (1) positive; (2) dependent on regulatory constraints that determine the issue price; (3) positively related to volatility; (4) negatively related to leverage; (5) negatively related to owner-managers’ shareholdings (6) inversely re- lated to proxies of manipulation; and (7) negatively related to illiquidity. We empirically test our model’s predictions, along with others from literature, on a sample of <b>private</b> <b>placements</b> issued in the Indian capital markets during 2001 - 09 and report empirical evidence largely consistent with the model. ...|$|R

5|$|During the 1950s, {{the main}} {{customers}} for charter flights had been Norwegian shipping companies, who flew their crew home from ports in Central Europe. In 1959, Saga Tours was created {{as the first}} travel agency for Mediterranean charter trips, and the company started a cooperation with Braathens SAFE. The first DC-4 flew to Mallorca that year. In 1961, the company's first Douglas DC-6B was bought. It had a capacity of 96 passengers, and cooperation was also started with Metro and Paddan in Gothenburg. Other charter destinations were London, Alicante and Málaga, both in Spain. That year, Braathens SAFE bought 50% of Saga Tours in a <b>private</b> <b>placement.</b> Braathens SAFE established an office in Gothenburg in 1965. After Vingresor had been bought by SAS and moved to Stockholm three years later, three employees started Atlas Resor in Gothenburg, and started using Braathens SAFE as their airline.

5|$|The airline was by September {{again in}} need of new capital. The {{contracts}} with Britannia ended on 1 November. While there was a high demand for 737-300 aircraft, aviation regulations hindered Norway Airlines from wet leaseing the aircraft (with full crew) and limited them to dry leaseing (without crew), which jeopardized the jobs of 86 employees. There were speculations in mid-October that Air Europe was planning to purchase Norway Airlines. Lyng had by then bought Ansett's share and held a 55-percent ownership. Norway Airlines announced on 25 October that they would lease both their aircraft to Air Europe on a five-year contract, one aircraft from November 1988 and one from March 1989. The airline would have to continue with ad-hoc charters for the one aircraft until March. The deal also involved that the United Kingdom-based International Leisure Group (ILG) would purchase a 33-percent share of Norway Airlines through a <b>private</b> <b>placement</b> of NOK25 million.|$|E
