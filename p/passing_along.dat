5|$|As it {{continued}} northeast through the Roseville and Loma Portal neighborhoods, SR209 intersected both Harbor Boulevard and Nimitz Boulevard before <b>passing</b> <b>along</b> the northwestern {{edge of the}} Naval Training Center San Diego (now closed and redeveloped as Liberty Station) and providing access to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego at Barnett Street. SR209 continued from Midway Drive northeast to the intersection of Sports Arena Boulevard and Camino del Rio West, where the highway continued north onto the latter, terminating at the ramps leading into the interchange with I-5 and I-8.|$|E
5|$|Past {{the end of}} the reservoir, NY10 {{continues}} northeast in {{the vicinity}} of the Delaware River to Walton, a village located directly on the banks of the river. Within the village limits, NY10 overlaps NY206 along Delaware Street before separating from the route and proceeding east out of the village. NY10 remains alongside the Delaware as it continues northeast to Delhi, the home of the State University of New York at Delhi. After <b>passing</b> <b>along</b> the eastern edge of the campus, NY10 intersects and briefly overlaps NY28 through the village center before quietly leaving the area.|$|E

5|$|Although the Chester Canal was not {{a success}} as traffic was sparse, this changed once it was {{connected}} to the Ellesmere Canal. The Ellesmere company expected to carry limestone from the quarries at Llanymynech and Trevor, iron from the ironworks at Ruabon and Bersham, and coal from mines at Chirk, Ruabon and Wrexham to Chester, Liverpool and Shrewsbury. The canal to Bersham and Wrexham was not built, and that to Shrewsbury was built much later on, but trade in coal, limestone, lime and building materials developed within the network of canals, and traffic between the canals and Liverpool increased steadily, much of it <b>passing</b> <b>along</b> the former Chester Canal. Receipts for the Ellesmere Canal were £12,568 in 1807 and £15,707 just two years later.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{overwhelming}} French majority in numbers, {{the attack was}} a disaster: nearly 1,000 French soldiers were killed as the boats were caught in open water under the island's gun batteries: several were sunk with all hands. Heavy fire from batteries and Royal Marines prevented a single French soldier from landing and the retreating fleet was subject to heavy fire from the smaller island to the north, inflicting further losses. British casualties were negligible. Although this operation indicated the probable result of a full-scale invasion of Britain, the threat remained and British forces began a close blockade of the surviving landing craft that were anchored in the Cotentin ports. A month after the battle this strategy resulted in a secondary success when a French frigate and corvette <b>passing</b> <b>along</b> the coast were intercepted and defeated by the blockade squadron.|$|E
5|$|From Lexington Avenue, where NY390 passes {{into the}} town of Greece, north to NY104, NY390 runs {{parallel}} to {{the western edge of}} Eastman Business Park, the large production and distribution complex owned and maintained by Eastman Kodak. Midway between the Lexington Avenue and West Ridge Road exits, NY390 encounters Ridgeway Avenue via a partial diamond interchange. Just north of Ridgeway Avenue, the expressway crosses a small, narrow strip of land that lies within the Rochester city limits, a carryover from when the Erie Canal occupied this tract and entered the city decades before. North of the strip, NY390 curves to the northeast, <b>passing</b> <b>along</b> {{the west side of the}} industrial park and the eastern edge of a residential yet wooded area to reach NY104. Heading northbound, it splits into two halves, with exit24A connecting to NY104 east and exit24B linking to NY104 west.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain, and the country's coastal defences {{received}} little attention. The Gorges family continued as captains at Hurst, with Sir Edward Gorges taking up the post in 1610, but the castle was neglected. In 1628, the castle was unable to prevent Flemish ships from <b>passing</b> <b>along</b> the Solent, as only {{four or five of}} the castle's twenty-seven guns were functional, and the fort had no ammunition or powder for them. The government replaced all the brass ordnance in the castle, which were preferred, particularly on ships, as they could fire faster and more safely, with iron guns in 1635.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} portion of Brighton, NY31 meets I-590 {{by way of}} an {{interchange}} and intersects NY65. From NY65, NY31 continues southeast into the town of Pittsford, <b>passing</b> <b>along</b> the southern fringe of Oak Hill Country Club and paralleling the former right-of-way of the Auburn Road railroad line {{to the village of}} Pittsford. Just inside the village limits, NY31 crosses the Erie Canal once more and intersects the West Shore Subdivision at-grade. In the village center, NY31 intersects NY96. East of NY96, the route crosses over the Erie Canal once again and exits the village. Outside of the village, NY31 parallels I-490 for a short distance across slightly open areas before connecting to the freeway near the Perinton town line at exit26. The route continues east into Perinton, where it traverses the Erie Canal for one final time within the county and crosses NY250 near Perinton Square Mall.|$|E
5|$|MD346 {{continues}} east as Old Ocean City Boulevard, <b>passing</b> <b>along</b> {{the southern}} edge of Whaleyville, where the highway intersects MD610 (Whaleyville Road). The state highway curves southeast and crosses over MD90 (Ocean City Expressway) with no access, then turns south through the hamlet of St. Martin before intersecting US50 (Ocean Gateway). MD346 turns southeast, paralleling US50 for a while before turning south toward the center of Berlin. Upon entering the town limits of Berlin, the state highway curves east to intersect MD818 (Main Street). MD346 has a grade crossing of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad's Snow Hill Line track, then intersects MD377 (Williams Street) immediately before an intersection with US113 (Worcester Highway). The state highway passes south of Atlantic General Hospital and veers northeast to its eastern terminus at a tangent intersection with US50.|$|E

The highway continues north and northwest through valleys and over hills and through a part of the Modoc National Forest, through the community of Avila Place, and then enters the east end of the Big Valley, where it begins to overlap SR 299 through Adin. The combined routes continue northerly through another part of the forest and over Adin Pass into the Warm Springs Valley, where SR 139 splits to the northwest near Canby.|$|E
5|$|State Route 664 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with State Route 120 in community of Lock Haven. The highway progresses northward, leaving the community limits of Lock Haven. After the intersection with East Water Street, State Route 664 crosses the West Branch of the Susquehanna River. The {{bridge over the}} branch of river was constructed in 1986. At the intersection with Farrandsville Road, the highway turns eastward, paralleling the river. Nearing State Route 150, the highway turns northward and into Dunnstown. While winding around a few curves, State Route 664 intersects with Armory Drive, an access road to a local armory. The route's surroundings are highly developed in Dunnstown, with the highway <b>passing</b> <b>along</b> homes. At the intersection with Aikey Street, State Route 664 leaves Dunnstown and proceeds northward.|$|E
5|$|Study {{has shown}} that the origin of charge is from certain types of {{subatomic}} particles which have the property of electric charge. Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact, or by <b>passing</b> <b>along</b> a conducting material, such as a wire. The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.|$|E

5|$|Between 1952 and 1954, 398 armored {{vehicles}} were destroyed, 84% {{of them from}} mines and booby traps. Typically, the Viet Minh ambushed convoys by obstructing the road with a fallen tree or pile of boulders, and then destroying {{the first and last}} vehicles of the halted convoy with remote mines. Caltrops, mines and the steep cliff faces naturally found at the road side aided in funneling the target convoy into a small area, where machine guns, mortars and recoilless rifles were trained. Viet Minh Regiment 95 repeatedly deployed these tactics, inflicting severe losses on the French forces <b>passing</b> <b>along</b> Route One, which led to its French nickname of la rue sans joie ("the Street Without Joy"). Regiment 95 was, along with regiments 18 and 101, part of the Viet Minh Division 325, commanded by General Tran Quy Ha. The division was formed in 1951 from pre-existing units in Thừa Thiên just north of Route One, and became operational in the summer of 1952.|$|E
5|$|In American football, <b>passing,</b> <b>along</b> {{with running}} (also {{referred}} to as rushing), {{is one of the}} two main methods of advancing the ball down the field. Passes are typically attempted by the quarterback, but any offensive player can attempt a pass provided they are behind the line of scrimmage. To qualify as a passing play, the ball must have initially moved forward after leaving the hands of the passer; if the ball initially moved laterally or backwards, the play would instead be considered a running play. A player who catches a forward pass is a receiver, and the number of receiving yards each player has recorded in each season is a recorded stat in football games. In addition to the overall National Football League (NFL) receiving champion, league record books recognize statistics from the American Football League (AFL), which operated from 1960 to 1969 before being absorbed into the NFL in 1970, Although league record books do not recognize stats from the All-America Football Conference, another league that merged with the NFL, these statistics are recognized by the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|One of the British {{reinforcements}} cruising in the Central Mediterranean in June was the frigate , {{commanded by}} Captain Edward Foote. Seahorse was officially rated as a 38-gun ship, {{but in reality}} carried 46 guns, including 14 32-pounder carronades, very heavy short-range cannon. Foote had been despatched by Earl St. Vincent to join Nelson's squadron in his hunt for the French and carried on board a number of reinforcements for , one of Nelson's ships commanded by Captain Thomas Troubridge. On 26 June 1798, Seahorse was <b>passing</b> <b>along</b> the southern Sicilian coast in search {{of information about the}} whereabouts of the British fleet when at 16:00 his lookout sighted a ship. Advancing rapidly, Foote recognised the stranger as a French frigate and prepared for battle. The frigate was Sensible, which was on a northeasterly course from Malta to Toulon when sighted. Bourdé, knowing that his ship was overladen, undermanned and carried only 36 guns, some of which were only 6-pounders, turned away and sailed south, hoping to outrun his opponent during the night.|$|E

5|$|He {{expressed}} {{surprise that}} a task {{as important as}} the expedition's was entrusted to such young men. Von Hentig had to convince the Emir that the mission did not consider themselves merchants, but instead brought word from the Kaiser, the Ottoman Sultan, and from India, wishing to recognise Afghanistan's complete independence and sovereignty. The Kaiser's typewritten letter, which he compared to the handsome greeting received from the Ottomans, failed to settle the Emir's suspicions; he doubted its authenticity. Von Hentig's explanation that the Kaiser had written the letter using the only instrument available at his field headquarters before the group's hurried departure may not have entirely convinced him. <b>Passing</b> <b>along</b> the Kaiser's invitation to join the war {{on the side of the}} Central Powers, von Hentig described the war situation as favourable and invited the Emir to declare independence. This was followed by a presentation from Kasim Bey explaining the Ottoman Sultan's declaration of jihad and Turkey's desire to avoid a fratricidal war between Islamic peoples. He passed along a message to Afghanistan similar to the Kaiser's. Barkatullah invited Habibullah to declare war against the British Empire and to come to the aid of India's Muslims. He proposed that the Emir should allow Turco-German forces to cross Afghanistan for a campaign towards the Indian frontier, a campaign which he hoped the Emir would join. Barkatullah and Mahendra Pratap, both eloquent speakers, pointed out the rich territorial gains the Emir stood to acquire by joining the Central Powers.|$|E

The Green Line of the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) TRAX system briefly parallels I-80 before traveling {{down the center of}} North Temple Street. I-80 becomes concurrent with I-15 after interchanges with SR-58 and 600South and continues south for about , <b>passing</b> <b>along</b> the western and southern edges of downtown Salt Lake City. The southern interchange with I-15, which also includes SR-201 (21st South Freeway) and marks the end of the concurrency, is known as the Spaghetti Bowl,. In the southwestern corner of the Spaghetti Bowl is another portion of the UTA TRAX Green Line as it travels towards West Valley City. After separating from I-15, the freeway continues easterly through South Salt Lake, loosely following an alignment just south of 2100South and the UTA S Line streetcar through the Sugar House neighborhood and past Sugar House Parkonce the home of the Sugar House Prison towards the clockwise terminus of the I-215 270° belt route around Salt Lake. It continues through Parley's Canyon, where the freeway joins the historical route of the Lincoln Highway.
