50|$|Cycads can be {{cut into}} pieces to make new plants, or by direct {{planting}} of the seeds. Propagation by seeds is the preferred method of growth, and two unique risks to their germination exist. One is that the seeds have no dormancy, so the embryo is biologically required to maintain growth and development, which means if the seed dries out, it dies. The second is that the emerging radicle and embryo can be very susceptible to fungal diseases in its early stages, when in unhygienic or excessively wet conditions. Thus, many cycad growers pregerminate the seeds in moist, sterile media such as vermiculite or perlite. However <b>pregermination</b> is not necessary, and many report success by directly planting the seeds in regular potting soil. As with many plants, a combination of well-drained soil, sunlight, water and nutrients will help it to prosper. Although, because of their hardy nature, cycads do not necessarily require the most tender or careful treatment, they can grow in almost any medium, including soilless ones. One {{of the most common}} causes of cycad death is from rotting stems and roots due to over-watering.|$|E

40|$|Relief of salt (0. 1 molar NaCl) {{stress on}} {{germination}} of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L., cv Mesa 659) seeds occurred with applications of 0. 05 millimolar kinetin (KIN) and 1 to 10 millimolar 1 -aminocyclopropane 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC). Treatment with KIN enhanced the <b>pregermination</b> ethylene production under saline condition. A synergistic or an additive enhancement of <b>pregermination</b> ethylene production and germination occurred under saline condition {{in the presence}} of KIN and a saturating dose (10 millimolar) of ACC. No KIN-ACC synergism was noted in ethylene production or germination under nonsaline condition. Addition of 1 millimolar aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) inhibited the KIN-enhanced <b>pregermination</b> ethylene production (85 to 89 %) and germination (58 %) under saline condition but not the synergistic effect of KIN + ACC on ethylene production. Under nonsaline condition, AVG had no effect on germination even though ethylene production was strongly inhibited. Alleviation of salt stress by KIN was inhibited in a competitive manner by 2, 5 -norbornadiene (NBD) (0. 02 - 0. 2 milliliter per liter), and the addition of ACC and/or ethylene reduced this inhibition. An increase in the <b>pregermination</b> ethylene production and germination occurred also by cotylenin E (CN) under saline condition. However, neither AVG (1 millimolar) nor NBD (0. 02 to 0. 2 milliliter per liter) prevented the relief of salt stress by CN. Thus, KIN may alleviate salt stress on germination by promoting both ACC production and its conversion to ethylene. Rapid utilization of ACC may be the basis for the synergistic or the additive effect of KIN plus ACC. The need for ethylene production and action for the relief of salt stress is circumvented by a treatment with CN...|$|E

The achenes {{on the periphery}} of the capitulum are heavy (0. 27 mg) and are without a pappus, whereas those in the center are light (0. 10 mg), more numerous, and bear a pappus. Several studies of other species of Asteraceae have shown that these morphological differentiations are accompanied by biological differences, but few studies have tested whether these differences are constant between populations. We compared the germination, growth, phenology, and reproductive effort of plants derived from these two types of achenes from three populations that had been established for 3, 13, and 36 yr. The peripheral achenes from the young population germinated fastest and gave rise to the most vigorous individuals. The differences in the two other populations were slight or nonexistent.

No inhibition was observed without the presoaking. Induction of nitrate reductase activity by nitrate was never inhibited by actinomycin D under the same conditions, and was frequently stimulated about 50 %. Thus, the method of applying actinomycin D to the seeds and ovules could affect interpretation of its action. Abscisic acid at 5 μg/ml blocked production of isocitrate lyase activity in both <b>pregermination</b> treatments, but did not inhibit induction of nitrate reductase activity. Induction of nitrate reductase activity became insensitive to the two inhibitors during ovule maturation, at about 32 days after anthesis. The results indicate that isocitrate lyase, a germination enzyme, is not synthesized on performed mRNA.

Discrete community compositions were identified in the endorhizosphere, rhizoplane, and rhizosphere soil of plants grown in an agricultural soil for up to 36 days.

Priming or hardening is a <b>pregermination</b> treatment. This treatment consists of incorporating an osmotic seed treatment (osmopriming) or a hormonal (hormopriming) and/or a redehydration (hydropriming) treatment. The approach allows {{the elimination of}} dormancy, homogenization (synchronization) of germination, better growth, earlier flowering and a tolerance to abiotic stresses such as drought and salinity. In this kind of treatment, the seed is soaked and then dehydrated before radicle breakthrough, i. e. during the reversible phase of germination. Thus, the seed can return to its initial stage without any damage. Objectives. In this paper, we aimed to study the consequences of hydropriming and osmopriming (by PEG 6000 at 10 and 30 %) on cowpea seeds (Vigna unguiculata), on germination performance and on the water stress tolerance of plants from these seeds. Method. Vigna unguiculata seeds were hydroprimed, hydroprimed twice or osmoprimed (with PEG 6000 10 and 30 %). For each treatment, germination performance (germination capacity, speed) and the water stress tolerance of the plants were studied. Results. Results showed that increased hardness of the seed allowed a faster, more uniform germination and better growth of both the radicle and aerial parts. We also demonstrated that a double redehydration was more effective in improving these parameters. Conclusions.

Global changes in gene ex-pression were analyzed by microarray hybridization between conidia incubated for 0 h (dormant), 1 h (<b>pregermination),</b> 2. 5 h (postgermination), 4 h (appressoria), and 15 h (early mycelium). Considerable changes were observed, in particular between 0 h and 1 h. Genes induced during germination were enriched in those genes encoding secreted proteins, including lytic enzymes. Comparison of wild-type and a nonpathogenic MAP kinase mutant (bmp 1) revealed marked differences in germination-related gene expression, in particular related to secretory proteins. Using promoter-GFP reporter strains, we detected a strictly germina-tion-specific expression pattern of a putative chitin deacetylase gene (cda 1).

40|$|Introduction: B. campestris {{is an old}} {{plant that}} {{commonly}} grows in arid and semi-arid areas. It has mucilage in the epidermal cells of canola seeds, a considerable variation in growth form and characteristics across the many cultivars. These species have in general, a flat root without an elongated crown, with stems that typically grow 30 to 120 cm tall. The leaves are large, soft, smooth or soft-hairy. The yellow flowers are small, usually less than 2 cm long (24). Seed priming is a procedure in which seed is soaked and then dried back to its original water content. Hydropriming uses only water {{in the process of}} controlled imbibitions, but osmopriming simply means soaking seeds in an osmotic solution. Seed priming is a technique of controlled hydration and drying that results in more rapid germination when the seed is reimbibed. Priming can be a valuable process for improving germination and uniformity of heterogeneously matured seed lots. Seed priming has been successfully demonstrated to improve germination and emergence in seeds of many crops, particularly vegetables and small seeded grasses. Seed priming is a presowing strategy for influencing seedling development by modulating <b>pregermination</b> metabolic activity prior to emergence of the radicle and generally enhances germination rate and plant performance. Fast germination and uniform emergence assist the farmer to “catch up” on the time lost to drought (17, 18). This research aimed to study the effect of the best treatments of osmopriming and hydropriming on varieties of mustard seed germination traits was conducted. Materials and Methods: The present research was conducted under laboratory conditions of the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran, during 2012 to determine the seed priming effects on germination traits of two cultivars of mustard.
