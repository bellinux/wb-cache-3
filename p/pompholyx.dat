40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} {{relative}} {{frequency of the}} different causes of <b>pompholyx</b> evoked in the literature. Design Prospective survey. Setting Clinical outpatient setting. Patients A total of 120 consecutive patients with <b>pompholyx</b> referred to our department from 2000 through 2003. Main Outcome Measures Systematic investigation of different causes of pompholyx: fungal intertrigo, hyperhidrosis, atopy, contact eczema, and internal reactions with systematic provocation tests to metals, balsam of Peru, and food allergen when suspected. Results The present study found the following causes of <b>pompholyx</b> in the 120 patients: mycosis (10. 0 %); allergic contact <b>pompholyx</b> (67. 5 %), with cosmetic and hygiene products as the main factor (31. 7 %), followed by metals (16. 7 %); and internal reactivation from drug, food, or haptenic (nickel) origin (6. 7 %). The remaining 15. 0 % of patients were classified as idiopathic patients, but all were atopic. (Percentages do not total 100 because of rounding.) Conclusions Our data confirm the existence of reactional <b>pompholyx</b> to interdigital-plantar intertrigos and endogenous reactions to metals or other allergens, but they mainly point at the unexpected importance of a so-called contact <b>pompholyx</b> in which cosmetic and hygiene products play a preponderant role compared with metals. The great frequency of atopic conditions, even if idiopathic <b>pompholyx</b> is not inferred as an equivalent of atopy, should lead to further causative investigations before undertaking more expensive or extensive treatments of refractory <b>pompholyx...</b>|$|E

40|$|Context: <b>Pompholyx</b> (called {{dyshidrosis}} by some) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common conditions and its immune response is presently poorly understood. Case report: We describe a 58 year old African American female with a clinical history of rheumatoid arthritis and type II diabetes who presented a chronic five-year, itchy vesicular/blistering rash involving her hands and feet. A lesional skin biopsy was taken for hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) analysis. In addition, a multicolor direct immunofluorescence (MDIF) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies were performed. The major findings to be reported were: the H & E examination revealed spongiotic dermatitis and pompholix. IHC and MDIF studies demonstrated focally deposits of positive CD 45, CD 3, CD 8, anti myeloperoxidase (MPO), and anti-human IgE, C 3 C, C 3 D and anti-human-fibrinogen within the epidermal spongiotic process, as well as around the blood vessels surrounding the inflammatory process especially at the sweat glands and respective ductus. The patient began mycophenolate mofetil therapy, with successful clearing of the palms and soles. Conclusion: The significance of our findings indicates a complex immunological process including complement, MPO and T-cell immune response.

40|$|Background: Hand eczema is {{a common}} {{distressing}} condition aggravated {{by a number of}} endogenous and exogenous factors. Various morphological forms of hand eczema have been described, but categorization into one of them is not always possible. Aims: To study the morphological patterns of hand eczema, relationship of atopy with hand eczema, and the implications of contact sensitization with respect to severity and diagnosis of hand eczema. Methods: Hundred consecutive patients of hand eczema attending the contact dermatitis clinic of the institute were recruited over a two year period from 2004 - 05. Objective assessment was done using hand eczema severity index (HECSI) and all the patients were patch tested using Indian standard series. Results: Unspecified type of hand eczema with no definite morphologic picture was seen in 62 % followed by <b>pompholyx</b> in 14 %. Hand eczema severity was not found to be statistically associated with age, sex, and atopic status of the patient. Positive patch test to one or more allergen was present in 65 % of patients. The most common allergens were potassium dichromate (25 %), fragrance mix (16 %), nickel sulphate (14 %), and PPD (13 %). There was no significant correlation between patch test positivity and hand eczema severity or atopic status of the patient. Among the morphological patterns <b>pompholyx</b> was strongly associated with an atopic status (P= 0. 004). Conclusions: Hand eczema was seen twice more commonly in men. Atopic and non-atopic patients of hand eczema had no difference in the severity of disease. Contact sensitivity to different allergens did not correlate with increased eczema severity...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dyshidrotic hand eczema is a {{relatively}} common vesicobullous disorder of the palms and soles. It {{is also known as}} <b>pompholyx,</b> dyshidrotic hand dermatitis, and palmoplantar eczema. It is characterized by pruritic lesions that can erupt in a chronic or relapsing pattern with episodes lasting months to years. The condition can be difficult to treat because of the thickness of the affected skin and the numerous sweat glands. Current treatments are not always effective and pose their own risks. Studies have shown associations between hyperhidrosis and dyshidrotic hand eczema. Botulinum toxin A (BTXA) has been used to treat hyperhidrosis with success. This leads to the possibility that BTXA may be an effective treatment option for refractory cases of dyshidrotic hand eczema. Methods: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was conducted using Medline-OVID, EBMR Multifile, CINAHL, and Web of Science. The keywords dyshidrotic eczema, eczema, <b>pompholyx,</b> and botulinum toxins were used in the search. The relevant articles were evaluated for quality using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Results: Two prospective control studies met inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. The first study investigated whether BTXA injections used with topical corticosteroids could treat dyshidrotic hand eczema better than topical therapy alone. Eight adult patients were enrolled with dyshidrotic hand eczema. Itching and vesiculation were inhibited earlier when using both BTXA and corticosteroids compared to corticosteroids alone. The second study evaluated the effects of BTXA injections as a treatment for dyshidrotic hand eczema with the other hand as an untreated control. Ten patients with bilateral hand eczema enrolled in the study. There were significant reductions in patient important outcomes and disease processes in the BTXA treatment hand compared to the control. Conclusion: BTXA can be a reasonable treatment option for patients with refractory dyshidrotic hand eczema. This treatment may be even more valuable in patients with hyperhidrosis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this study, {{we explore}} the {{usefulness}} of zooplankton {{as a tool for}} assessing the trophic status of a Nigerian forest river. The river was sampled monthly and investigated for water physico-chemistry and zooplankton community structure using basic statistical measurement of diversity indices to characterize the zooplankton fauna. The trophic status of the river evaluated from its physico-chemical parameters indicates that the river is oligotrophic. The zooplankton composition was typical of a tropical freshwater river, with a total of 40 species, made up of 16 rotifers, 12 cladocerans, and 12 copepods and their developing stages in the following order of dominance: Rotifera> Cladocera> Cyclopoida> Calanoida. There were strong correlations between the lake’s trophic status and its zooplankton communities. The zooplankton community was dominated by numerous species of rotifers and crustaceans, which are typical of oligotrophic to mesotrophic systems, such species including Conochilus dossuarius and Synchaeta longipes. However, the most dominant zooplankton species in West African freshwater ecosystems, viz., Keratella tropica, Keratella quadrata, Brachionus angularis, Trichocerca pusilla, Filinia longiseta, <b>Pompholyx</b> sulcata, and Proales sp., and others that are indicator species of high trophic levels, were not recorded in the river.

The present study was undertaken to establish whether tinea pedis, atopic dermatitis or nickel allergy is a risk factor for development of vesicular eruptions. Three-hundred-and-ninety-eight individuals (included from an ongoing population study on hand eczema in twins) were included. A history of previous hand eczema and atopic dermatitis was taken, and a clinical examination including a patch test with nickel was performed. A test sample for tinea pedis was taken from the fourth interdigital space on the right foot. The relative risk for vesicular eruptions present in individuals with tinea pedis was 3. 58 (confidence limits 1. 19 – 10. 82, pv 0. 05).

Abundances of 26 species occurring in the plankton, as well as physical and chemical parameters (water temperature, O 2, total phosphorus, SRP, NO 3 -, NO 2 - NH 4 +, chlorophyll a) were determined at different depths. Erosion of the hypolimnion due to autumnal storms and decrease in temperature was interrupted by fine weather periods with the occurrence of re-stratification, thus allowing mass production of algae and rotifers (Synchaeta oblonga, S. tremula, Keratella cochlearis) through exploitation of newly available nutrients. Warm stenothermal 'summer species' (e. g. <b>Pompholyx</b> sulcata, Trichocerca pusilla, Liliferotrocha subtilis) became less abundant {{as a consequence of the}} progressive mixing process, whereas the appearance of new species was a rare event. The late summer occurrence of Liliferotrocha subtilis in the fraction < 30 mum (up to 3500 ind. l- 1) is remarkable.

40|$|In situ grazing {{measurements}} using fluorescent {{particles of}} 0. 5, 2. 4 and 6. 3 mu m diameter in eutrophic Lake Loosdrecht (The Netherlands) showed that Anuraeopsis fissa, a small rotifer, filtered the smallest, bacteria sized particles as efficiently or {{more efficiently than}} the larger particles. In contrast, three other rotifer species (Brachionus angularis, Filinia longiseta and <b>Pompholyx</b> sulcata) filtered the bacteria- sized particles less efficiently than the larger particles. Both Keratella cochlearis and Conochilus unicornis only ingested the bacteria-sized particles. Anuraeopsis fissa had a higher uptake of fluorescent bacteria-sized particles than K. cochlearis, both in 1 mu m filtrate of lake water and in lake water. Within both species, uptake did not differ between juveniles and adults. When cultured on three different size fractions of lake water (1, 3 and 15 mu m filtrate) in July, all rotifer species declined in numbers on the 1 and 3 mu m filtrates, while A. fissa and B. angularis increased in numbers on the 15 mu m filtrate. The high abundance of small bacteria in the lake water could not support rotifer populations. It is concluded that bacteria are not a suitable food source of high quality for A. fissa because its population does not grow even though the bacterial concentration was higher than its estimated threshold food concentration. In August, when individually cultured, the mortality was high for all species, but especially for F. longiseta. The lifespan of K. cochlearis was reduced in the 1 and 3 mu m filtrates of lake water, compared with in the 15 mu m filtrate. The lifespan of A. fissa was similar in all filtrates, but reproduction was reduced in the 1 and 3 mu m filtrates, as in Keratella. On the 15 mu m filtrate, their ages at first reproduction and growth rates did not differ. Individuals of A,fissa older than 4 days showed a higher survival in the 15 mu m filtrate than {{in the other two}} filtrates, as did K. cochlearis throughout its life. Hence, bacteria seem to be a more important food source for younger individuals of A. fissa than of K. cochlearis.

Four species (Keratella australis, K slacki, Lecane herzigi and L. tasmaniensis), previously recorded as endemic to Australia, {{are added to the}} New Zealand checklist. Species composition, seasonal abundance, and vertical distribution of planktonic rotifers were investigated in Lake Grasmere, South Island, based on a biweekly sampling program from November 1988 to January 1990. Of the 44 species identified in the lake, 17 were planktonic with Polyarthra cf. dolichoptera, Keratella cochlearis, and <b>Pompholyx</b> sulcata dominant. Maximum rotifer densities occurred in May (1600 ind. 1 - 1) and October (1500 ind. 1 - 1), and numbers were lowest in July (120 ind. 1 - 1) and March (250 ind:- 1). The majority of species were most abundant in midwater (5 - 9 m depth), although some showed depth preferences near the surface or the bottom. A simple, rapid technique for the preparation of rotifer trophi for scanning electron microscopy is described. The method permits careful visual monitoring of trophi during the extraction process and does not require critical point drying of specimens. Subsequently, trophi of Filinia species from 16 South Island lakes and three North Island lakes were examined and compared with specimens from Australia, Austria, Belgium, Turkey, and Yemen. Five species of Filinia (brachiata, longiseta, cf. pejleri, novaezealandiae, and terminalis) were positively identified from the New Zealand samples. Numbers of unci teeth were considered to be the most reliable features for identification within the genus. Numbers obtained from SEM are listed for the first time. Experiments on the influence of temperature (5 °- 25 °C) on morphology, life history, and growth rate of F. terminalis and F. cf. pejleri were performed in replicated individual cultures with Oocystis sp. as food. Some morphological characteristics previously used in identification of both species were found to be affected by temperature and also by life cycle stage. However, numbers of unci teeth were not affected. Body and setal lengths, life spans, all stages of development, and growth rates of both species decreased with increasing temperature. Offspring number per female of both rotifers was highest at 20 °C, but the maximum growth rate of F. telminalis was at 25 °C, whereas that of F. cf. Pejleri was at 20 °C. Finally, I examined the effect of salinity on survival and growth of Hexarthra fennica, a species found normally in saline waters but also found in freshwater Lake Grasmere. The freshwater euryhaline H. fennica was able to survive and reproduce at salinities up to 13 %, whereas a related species H. mira (found only in freshwaters) was unable to survive at > 1 %...|$|E
40|$|Background Recent data {{suggests}} that skin conditions {{were the most}} common reason for patients to consult their GP with a new problem 1. Healthcare practitioners (HCPs) including pharmacists and nurses are recognized possible alternative sources to the GP for advice and treatment. However {{little is known about}} their ability to recognise and treat skin conditions. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare the ability of these HCPs to identify and suggest suitable first line management strategies for a number of skin conditions. Ethical approval for the study was sought and deemed unnecessary. Method HCPs were invited to participate in the study remotely at a specifically designed website (www. hpdiagnosticstudy. co. uk.). Among the skin conditions included were melasma, pitted keratolysis, tinea corporis, a verruca, scabies, molluscum contagiosum, pityriasis rosea, polymorphic eruption of pregnancy (presenting as possible urticaria), a basal cell papilloma and <b>pompholyx</b> eczema. Participants were recruited using local primary care research networks. Pharmacists were additionally recruited by an advertisement in the community pharmacy press. All participants accessed the site through an electronic link sent by email and were given 7 days to complete the test, followed up by a reminder 7 days later. The web site consisted of 10 peer-reviewed case studies including a digital image of the condition and associated case history. Participants were required to identify: 1) the condition 2) the features supporting the diagnosis 3) an appropriate first-line treatment option. A summative dermatology total score was computed for each participant for correctly identifying all three aspects. Since the groups were unmatched, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare the mean total dermatology scores between the different HCPs. Covariates were identified by computing a Pearson’s r correlation between the total scores and potential confounders. Results A total of 60 HCPs (20 pharmacists, GPs and practice nurses) took part in the study. There were significant associations (p< 0. 01) between total dermatology score and gender (r =. 49) and previous exposure to the skin condition (r =. 50). These were therefore included as covariates in the ANCOVA model. The mean total dermatology scores for pharmacists, nurses and GPs were 16. 3, 15. 6 and 19. 9 respectively and this difference was significant, F (2, 55) = 5. 83, p = 0. 005. The covariate gender also had a significant effect on total dermatology score, F (1, 55) = 7. 11, p = 0. 01. Post-hoc Sidak testing revealed that the difference in mean scores between GPs and both nurses and pharmacists was significant (p < 0. 05). Conclusion These preliminary results not surprisingly suggest that the GP is the most appropriate source of advice and treatment for patients with skin problems. This pilot study {{suggests that}} pharmacists and practice nurses have similar diagnostic abilities for a number of common skin conditions however further investigation embracing a larger sample, is required to substantiate this conclusion Reference 1.

40|$|Zooplankton {{community}} {{structure was}} studied monthly in Myponga and South Para Reservoirs in South Australia from January 2008 to June 2009. Myponga Reservoir {{is a highly}} managed reservoir with prolong artificial mixing while South Para Reservoir is non-managed and has less human perturbation. The total number of taxa in Myponga and South Para Reservoirs were 16 and 20 respectively. Cladocera was the dominant taxonomic group {{in relation to the}} total number of taxa but in terms of total density, Copepoda were the numerically dominant group in both reservoirs. The most frequently occurring Cladocera were Ceriodaphnia cf. quadrangula, Ceriodaphnia cornuta and Bosmina meridionalis while Asplanchna priodonta was the predominant Rotifera throughout the study. Copepoda were dominated by Calamoecia ampulla and Microcyclops sp., making up the largest portion of total zooplankton density. Differences with regard to species richness were due to the sole occurrence of Polyarthra dolichoptera, Keratella slacki, Anuraeopsis fissa and <b>Pompholyx</b> complanata in South Para Reservoir. Observations showed relatively consistent species diversity and density throughout the study in Myponga Reservoir except for low densities during summer for Cladocera and Copepoda groups while seasonal variations in zooplankton composition and abundance are features of South Para Reservoir. Shallow locations have greater zooplankton densities compared to deep locations in both reservoirs. Nevertheless, vertical migration in shallow locations was inexplicit as compared to deep locations in Myponga Reservoir. Physico-chemical factors particularly water temperature and biological factors including the occurrence of green algae and cyanobacteria may influence zooplankton abundance and the dynamics of the community. Thermal stratification and circulation resulted in brief population dispersion and consequently had a fluctuation of seasonal distribution pattern of zooplankton. Both horizontal gradients and stratification are strong factors enhancing zooplankton richness at South Para Reservoir. The functional responses of Daphnia carinata, D. lumholtzi and Ceriodaphnia cf. quadrangula to six algal species at three concentrations are described. The ingestion and filtration rates were measured by Low Revolutions per Minute Tumbler (LRPMT) for 2 hours at 20 oC. Ingestion and filtration rates varied with algal species and concentrations. Daphnia carinata removed algal cells at a higher rate than other two species when feeding on uni- and multi-algal species suspensions. Quantitative differences in the rate of food intake were found in suspensions of Ankistrodesmus falcatus, Scenedesmus obliquus, Chlorella vulgaris, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Anabaena circinalis and Microcystis flos-aquae. Small cells of green algae were more readily ingested by grazers. Ingestion rate increased linearly with cell concentration up to a maximal rate. Comparison of the ingestion rate on a green and blue-green algal mixture demonstrated the importance of edible algae in zooplankton selective feeding. Filamentous Anabaena circinalis and colonial Microcystis flos-aquae were less favourable as food particularly in a multi-algal suspension. In contrast, both these blue-green algal species can also be utilized by the grazers when presented as a unialgal suspension although these species were previously reported to have lethal toxic effects on cladocerans. Therefore, a management strategy using cladocerans for controlling undesirable cyanobacteria is contemplated to be necessary in the future. As the grazing rates would be correlated with zooplankton taxonomy composition, monitoring data is important in order to know the dominant zooplankton taxa in the reservoirs. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|L'évolution comparée des biocénoses rotatoriennes du Léman et du Lac de Constance montre un parallélisme remarquable lors des changements {{continus}} de l'état trophique, tant avant qu'après le niveau maximal d'eutrophisation atteint par ces deux lacs. La comparaison avec un certain nombre d'autres milieux soumis également à un changement de leur niveau trophique met en évidence une variation très nette des effectifs des espèces méso-eutrophes et eutrophes {{en fonction}} de la progression ou de la régression de l'eutrophisation; ces changements sont beaucoup moins marqués {{en ce qui concerne}} l'association des espèces oligo-mésotrophes. Eutrophication {{of a lake}} must be expected to cause both abiotic and biotic responses. The changes in the trophic state of a lake certainly occur at all trophic levels, but to different extents depending on the character of the ecosystem; the subsequent evolution of the rotifer biocenosis {{is one of the most}} pronounced features occurring as an indirect consequence of eutrophication. In the last three decades, the rotifer community in Lake Geneva has presented important changes in structure, as a result of continuous changes in the trophism of the lake. This study covered a period of time sufficient to show possible true modifications of the community structure. Lake Geneva has undergone anthropogenic eutrophication since the 1950 's. The lake reached its highest nutrient level during 1979 - 1980, which has decreased though since 1981 with the improvement of phosphorus removal in sewage treatment plants. A similar trend was observed in Lake Constance, with more important quantitative changes connected with previous results dating from the oligotrophic stage of this lake. Table 1 gives the variations in abundance of rotifer species observed during the eutrophication increase and during the decrease of the eutrophication level in some lakes of different trophic status. Figure 1 indicates the quantitative changes of the main rotifer species in Lake Geneva and Lake Constance. Compared to the maximal trophic level (indicated by arrow), data from Lake Geneva for 1959 - 1987 are similar to those obtained in Lake Constance between 1963 and 1978, if the previous data obtained for this lake during its oligotrophic stage are excluded. Figure 2 presents the general trend observed for the different trophic indicator groups during the increase or decrease of eutrophication. Throughout the eutrophication process, these groups exhibited a general increase for most of the different species, with the ratio "number of increasing species/number of decreasing species" growing from the oligo-mesotrophic group to the eutrophic one. During the decrease of eutrophication, the strength of meso-eutrophic and eutrophic indicator groups diminished more than that of the oligomesotrophic group. Many species have appeared during the eutrophication increase, mainly belonging to meso-eutrophic and eutrophic indicator groups, together with the settlement of some oligo-mesotrophicspecies (Ascomorpha saltans, Synchaeta oblonga, Notholca caudata). The proportion of meso-eutrophic and eutrophic species increased in the two lakes, but there is a trend in populations of the oligo-mesotrophic species to decrease, leading to a precocious disappearance of Ploesoma hudsoni and later of Ascomorpha ovalis, Gastropus stylifer, Ploesoma truncatum in Lake Constance, and of Synchaeta tremula and Notholca foliacea in both lakes. Decreasing eutrophication reduces the number of some mesoeutrophic (Trichocerca longiseta and T. pusilla in Lake Geneva, T. rousseleti in Lake Constance) and eutrophic species (Anuraeopsis fissa and Trichocera cylindrica in Lake Geneva, <b>Pompholyx</b> complanta in Lake Constance). However, the water quality has mot improved enough to allow a further increase in oligo-mesotrophic species, except for Conochilus unicornis in both lakes, and for Ascomorpha ecaudis, Kellicottia longispina and Synchaeta oblonga in Lake Geneva. Since 1981, the oligo-mesotrophic indicator group is numerically dominant in Lake Geneva (BALVAY and LAURENT, 1989 c), preceding the euryecious one (Asplanchna priodonta + Keratella cochlearis), white the strength of the meso-eutrophic group decreases and the eutrophic one remains almost steady...|$|E
