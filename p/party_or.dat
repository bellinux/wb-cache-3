Private bills normally relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property. Private Bill Committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network, the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link and extensions to the National Gallery of Scotland.|$|E

Gold standard Democrats opposed Bryan and the free silver platform. They formed a new party—the National Democratic <b>Party,</b> <b>or</b> Gold Democrats—which Buckner joined. At the new party's state convention in Louisville, Buckner's name was proposed {{as a candidate for}} vice president. He was given the nomination without opposition at the party's national convention in Indianapolis. Former Union general John Palmer was chosen as the party's nominee for president.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of his}} career, Peart {{had never}} {{publicly}} identified with any political <b>party</b> <b>or</b> organization in Canada or the United States. Even so, his political and philosophical views have often been analyzed through his work with Rush and through other sources. In October 1993, shortly before that year's Canadian federal election, Peart appeared with then-Liberal Party leader Jean Chrétien in an interview broadcast in Canada on MuchMusic. In that interview, Peart stated he was an undecided voter who supported Quebec federalism.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1904, Piłsudski formed a {{paramilitary}} unit (the Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist <b>Party,</b> <b>or</b> bojówki) aiming to create an armed resistance movement against the Russian authorities. The PPS organized an increasing numbers of demonstrations, mainly in Warsaw; on 28 October 1904, Russian Cossack cavalry attacked a demonstration, and in reprisal, during a demonstration on 13 November Piłsudski's paramilitary opened fire on Russian police and military. Initially concentrating their attention on spies and informers, in March 1905 the paramilitary began using bombs to assassinate selected Russian police officers.|$|E

5|$|The New Zealand Parliament holds {{legislative}} power {{and consists of}} the Queen and the House of Representatives. It also included an upper house, the Legislative Council, until this was abolished in 1950. The supremacy of Parliament, over the Crown and other government institutions, was established in England by the Bill of Rights 1689 and has been ratified as law in New Zealand. The House of Representatives is democratically elected and a government is formed from the <b>party</b> <b>or</b> coalition {{with the majority of}} seats. If no majority is formed, a minority government can be formed if support from other parties during confidence and supply votes is assured. The Governor-General appoints ministers under advice from the Prime Minister, who is by convention the parliamentary leader of the governing <b>party</b> <b>or</b> coalition. Cabinet, formed by ministers and led by the Prime Minister, is the highest policy-making body in government and responsible for deciding significant government actions. Members of Cabinet make major decisions collectively, and are therefore collectively responsible for the consequences of these decisions.|$|E
5|$|The Progress Party has {{historically}} sometimes been portrayed externally as a populist or right-wing populist <b>party</b> (<b>or</b> other similar terms), both by opposing politicians, {{as well as}} some scholars. Depending on definitions of populism, other scholars have however found that populism is at best a minor element of the <b>party,</b> <b>or</b> that its policies historically have been more consistent than for instance those of the Labour Party, which has moved more towards the Progress Party and neoliberalism since the 1980s. Political scientist Anders Todal Jensen has argued that the Progress Party is the only populist party in Norway, with all the other parties in contrast having strong elitist foundations. He has suggested that populism could actually be a sign of health as the structures of the traditional parties make them poorly able to “listen to the people” in the same manner that the Progress Party may.|$|E

5|$|The ninety-two {{peers are}} made up of three {{separate}} groups. Fifteen 'office-holders' comprise Deputy Speakers and Deputy Chairmen, and are elected by the House, while seventy-five party and Crossbench members are elected by their own <b>party</b> <b>or</b> group. In addition, there are two royal appointments: the Lord Great Chamberlain, currently the Marquess of Cholmondeley, is appointed as the Queen's representative in Parliament, while the post of Earl Marshal remains purely hereditary; the office has been held since 1672 by the Dukes of Norfolk and is responsible for ceremonies such as the State Opening of Parliament.|$|E

5|$|After her defeat, Bondfield resumed {{her work}} for NUGMW and was re-elected to the TUC Council. In 1926 she {{supported}} the TUC's decision {{to hold a}} General Strike, and also the decision to call it off after nine days. Following the resignation of Sir Patrick Hastings in June 1926, Bondfield was adopted as the Labour candidate at Wallsend, and won the subsequent by-election with a majority of over 9,000. Meanwhile, she had accepted appointment to the Blanesburgh Committee, which the Conservative government had set up to consider reforms to the system of unemployment benefit. Her private view, that entitlement to benefits should be related to contributions, was not widely shared in the Labour <b>Party</b> <b>or</b> the TUC. When the committee made recommendations along these lines she signed the report, which became {{the basis of the}} Unemployment Insurance Act 1927. Bondfield's association with this legislation permanently shadowed her relationship with the Labour movement.|$|E
