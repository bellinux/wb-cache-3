5|$|Canada {{was one of}} {{the last}} Western {{countries}} to get a nationwide <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> system.|$|E
5|$|In December 1969, Communications Minister Eric Kierans {{announced}} that a six-character <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> would be introduced, superseding the three-digit zone system.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> began with a test in Ottawa on 1 April 1971.|$|E
50|$|Some {{other large}} cities of France are also divided between several <b>postal</b> <b>codes,</b> but the <b>postal</b> <b>codes</b> do not {{correspond}} to arrondissements.|$|R
50|$|These {{abbreviations}} are not {{the source}} of letters in Canadian <b>postal</b> <b>codes,</b> which are assigned by Canada Post on a different basis than these abbreviations. While <b>postal</b> <b>codes</b> are also used for sorting, they allow extensive regional sorting. In addition, several provinces have <b>postal</b> <b>codes</b> that begin with different letters.|$|R
50|$|<b>Postal</b> <b>codes</b> in Nicaragua are 5 digit numeric. There are a total 929 <b>postal</b> <b>codes</b> {{assigned}} to 153 municipalities and 776 neighbourhoods in Managua.|$|R
5|$|When writing out {{the postal}} address for a {{location}} within Canada, the <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> follows the abbreviation for the province or territory.|$|E
5|$|Canada Post {{provides}} a free <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> look-up tool on its website, via its mobile application, and sells hard-copy directories and CD-ROMs. Many vendors also sell validation tools, which allow customers to properly match addresses and postal codes. Hard-copy directories {{can also be}} consulted in all post offices, and some libraries.|$|E
5|$|For example, {{in early}} 2008, the <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> G0N 3M0 (covering Sainte-Catherine-de-la-Jacques-Cartier, Fossambault-sur-le-Lac and Lac-Saint-Joseph, Quebec) was {{urbanized}} to postal codes beginning with G3N to remove ambiguities and confusions caused by similar street names. Unique among province-wide districts, New Brunswick (postal district E) is completely urbanized, its rural codes having been phased out.|$|E
50|$|Abuja {{is served}} by the Nigerian Postal Service which {{maintains}} <b>postal</b> <b>codes,</b> street names and zones. <b>Postal</b> <b>codes</b> and district names {{can also be found}} on geocodes.com.|$|R
5000|$|The three BES-islands, {{who became}} part of the country in 2010, do not as yet have <b>postal</b> <b>codes.</b> Just the address, town and island is {{sufficient}} for sending post to either of these islands (with [...] "Caribbean Netherlands" [...] as country when sent from abroad). The Dutch government has plans for introducing <b>postal</b> <b>codes</b> on these islands similar to the <b>postal</b> <b>codes</b> used in the European Netherlands.|$|R
50|$|The post {{handles the}} <b>postal</b> <b>codes</b> in Cape Verde. It has four digits {{and the first}} number {{is that of the}} island, <b>postal</b> <b>codes</b> start with the number 1xxx and ends with 9xxx.|$|R
5|$|The H0- prefix is an anomaly: the 0 {{indicates}} a very small, rural village, but H {{is used to}} designate Montreal, the second-largest city in Canada. As such, the H0- prefix is almost completely empty. H0M, assigned to the international Akwesasne tribal reserve on the Canada-US border, is the only other H0- <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> in active use.|$|E
5|$|The suburb was gazetted as a {{locality}} by the City of Stirling on 24 October 1975, {{although it had}} existed as a postal locality since 1971.* Postmaster General's Department (1971). White Pages – Perth. Lists Hamersley with a <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> of 6022 for the first time.|$|E
5|$|These postal codes each {{represent}} {{a number of}} military post offices abroad, which are specified not by <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> but by CFPO or FMO number. The LDUs in this case corresponding {{not so much to}} a physical as to a virtual delivery unit since mail is not delivered locally but is forwarded to the actual delivery units at Canadian military bases and ships abroad.|$|E
25|$|As of October 2014, new <b>postal</b> <b>codes</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} for each of Somalia's 18 administrative regions. The <b>postal</b> <b>codes</b> are two letters, such as AW for Awdal, BN for Banaadir, BR for Bari and SL for Sool.|$|R
50|$|<b>Postal</b> <b>codes</b> in Bulgaria {{have four}} digits.|$|R
50|$|<b>Postal</b> <b>codes</b> in Kosovo are 5 digit numeric.|$|R
25|$|In France the {{numeric code}} for the {{departments}} {{is used as}} the first two digits of the <b>postal</b> <b>code,</b> except for the two departments in Corsica that have codes 2A and 2B and use 20 as <b>postal</b> <b>code.</b> Furthermore, the codes are only the codes for the department in charge of delivery of the post, {{so it can be}} that a location in one department has a <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> starting with the number of a neighbouring department.|$|E
25|$|Åland {{has its own}} postal {{administration}} but still uses the Finnish five-digit <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> system, using the number range 22000-22999, with the prefix AX. The lowest numbered <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> is for the capital Mariehamn, AX 22100, and the highest AX 22950 for Jurmo.|$|E
25|$|Parks, large {{businesses}} such as shopping centres, and big houses, {{may have}} more than one entrance and more than one delivery point. So the semantic of an address and its <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> can vary, and one land lot {{may have more}} than one <b>postal</b> <b>code.</b> In Brazil only the suffixes 900-959, that designate large post-receivers, can be assigned to lots.|$|E
2500|$|By 1930 {{or earlier}} {{the idea of}} {{extending}} postal district or zone numbering plans beyond large cities to cover even small towns and rural locales was in the air. These developed into <b>postal</b> <b>codes</b> as we define them today. (The name of US <b>postal</b> <b>codes,</b> [...] "ZIP codes", reflects this evolutionary growth from a zone plan to a zone improvement plan [...]) Modern <b>postal</b> <b>codes</b> were first introduced in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in December 1932, but the system was abandoned in 1939. The next country to introduce <b>postal</b> <b>codes</b> was Germany in 1941, followed by Argentina in 1958, the United States in 1963 and Switzerland in 1964. The United Kingdom began introducing its current system in Norwich in 1959, {{but they were not}} used nationwide until 1974.|$|R
50|$|Below is {{the list}} of <b>postal</b> <b>codes</b> in Taiwan.|$|R
50|$|The {{district}} {{numbers are}} also used as <b>postal</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|R
25|$|A <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> {{is often}} {{related to a}} land lot, {{but this is not}} always the case.|$|E
25|$|Canada Post {{provides}} Mail and Courier {{services through}} its local post outlet, S0A 3H0 is the <b>postal</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
25|$|In February 2005, 117 of the 190 member {{countries}} of the Universal Postal Union had <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> systems.|$|E
50|$|The <b>postal</b> <b>codes</b> for Kapyl are 223910 and 223927.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Postal</b> <b>codes</b> {{since at}} least 1990: 7190, 7191 Écaussinnes-Lalaing ...|$|R
5|$|<b>Postal</b> <b>codes</b> can be {{correlated}} with databased information from censuses or health registries to create a geographic profile of an area's population. For instance, <b>postal</b> <b>codes</b> {{have been used to}} compare children's risk of developing cancer and to describe a neighbourhood's entrenched poverty ("Vancouver's Downtown Eastside is Canada's poorest postal code").|$|R
25|$|In Ireland, the new <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> system {{launched}} in 2015, known as Eircode provides a unique code {{for each individual}} address.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>postal</b> <b>code</b> systems, {{like those}} of Ecuador and Costa Rica, show an exact {{agreement}} with the hierarchy of administrative country subdivisions.|$|E
50|$|Danish <b>postal</b> <b>codes</b> {{have four}} digits, except for five special purpose 3-digit codes.The self-governed {{territory}} of Greenland {{is part of}} the Danish system while the Faroe Islands has its own 3-digit codes.New regulations add the country code DK to the <b>postal</b> <b>codes,</b> but in practice it is most often omitted.|$|R
