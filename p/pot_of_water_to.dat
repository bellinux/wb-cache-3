Then he {{slipped out of}} the pack-straps and clumsily dragged himself into a sitting posture. It was not yet dark, and in the lingering twilight he groped about among the rocks for shreds of dry moss. When he had gathered a heap he built a fire,--a smouldering, smudgy fire,--and put a tin <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> on <b>to</b> boil.|$|R

They were developed in 2008 by Canadian health workers in Cambodia, and in 2012 a company, The Lucky Iron Fish Project, was formed to develop the iron fish on a larger scale, promote them among rural areas, and distribute them to non-governmental organization partners.|$|R

50|$|Optionally, {{the meat}} and bones may be browned, by baking in an oven or searing in a pot or wok, before adding to a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> develop a richer flavor and darken the broth. Another {{optional}} technique to help remove impurities and produce a clearer broth is parboiling {{the meat and}} bones in boiling water for a few minutes, followed by draining out {{the water from the}} pot, and then rinsing the parboiled meat and bones with water before adding fresh water to the pot and then allowed to simmer. If a clear broth is desired, impurities that float {{to the top of the}} broth should be skimmed off while the broth is simmering.|$|E

The woman is in labor, and so Chadwick and the midwife (Joyce MgBaronye) agree to admit the woman as the home's first patient. That evening, while tending the woman, the midwife catches sight of movement and hears noises coming from outside. Frightened, she soon hears {{a knock at the}} door, but it turns out only to be Iruka coming to check up on the expectant mother. Relieved, the midwife resumes her work while Iruka sets a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> boil on the fire. Shortly thereafter, there is another noise, and when looking out the window the midwife spots a masked figure peering in. Believing the masked figure to be a spirit of the ancestors, the midwife cries out in fear, but Iruka throws the boiling water onto the figure, revealing Eze, who flees back into the surrounding overgrowth. [...] The next day the villagers march up to the maternity home for the opening ceremony, a traditional one complete with dancing, music, singing, and native costumes. Chadwick takes the center seat in front of the maternity home to watch the events, with, interestingly enough, Eze sitting near him. Eze has finally accepted that tradition and progress, as visible in the final scene, can go together after all. In the closing narration, Chadwick tells the viewer that progress brings [...] "power, spirit, unlimited and unknown possibilities and destinations" [...] and suggests that progress should be the ultimate goal of native society.|$|E
40|$|Statistical {{mechanics}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} comprehensive theories in physics. From a boiling <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> the complex dynamics of quantum many-body systems it provides a successful connection between the microscopic dynamics of atoms and molecules and the macroscopic properties of matter. However, statistical mechanics only describes the thermal equilibrium situation of a system, and there is no general framework to describe how equilibrium is reached or under which circumstances it can be reached at all. This problem is particularly challenging in quantum mechanics, where unitarity appears to render the very concept of thermalization counterintuitive. With the rapid experimental progress in the control and probing of ultracold quantum gases this question has become within reach of detailed experimental investigations. In these notes we present a series of experiments with ultracold one-dimensional Bose gases, which provide novel insights into this fundamental question.

5000|$|Traditionally the Quijos (Quichua) {{communities}} cooked {{over and}} open fire. The use of banana leaves to wrap their food {{was also very}} common. The banana leaf wrapped food items would then be cooked over the fire {{in one of two}} ways; either smoked/grilled over the open fire or placed in a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> boiling <b>water</b> <b>to</b> be steamed. The use <b>of</b> clay <b>pots</b> (olla) is not only an important aspect of traditional cooking but also of traditional art. Among their traditional dishes is the Yuyucallana, made with plants such as Yuyu (bud) scabbard, chontayuyu (chonta flower, yuyu (palmito) and banana leaf. Another favourite food of the Quijos is maito. This dish is cooked in the fire, it is fish (usually tilapia) wrapped in banana leaves. Finally, meals are served on the floor, on larger leaves of the banana tree.|$|R

Washing her hands, she next cut off the wings and legs of the fowl, and then separated the breast from the back. These portions she put into a small pot with some suet and water, and threw the rest away.|$|R
5000|$|Chemical reaction-based {{garments}} have cloth pouches or pockets where single-use {{packages of}} chemical hand warmers can be inserted. The hand warmers {{are about the}} size of a package of cards, and they contain chemicals which produce heat. One traditional hand warmer is a small metal box containing charcoal which, when lit, burns very slowly and produces a mild heat. Disposable heat packs typically contain cellulose, iron, water, activated carbon, vermiculite, and salt. When these packs are exposed to air, an exothermic chemical reaction occurs, which provides several hours of heat. Another chemical heating pad uses a gel that can be activated by twisting the package, thus triggering a chemical reaction. The pack can be put in a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> boiling <b>water</b> <b>to</b> convert the chemical reaction back and allow it to be reused. While these products are commonly called [...] "hand warmers", they can be placed in boots or, with special garments such as vests, in cloth pockets on the inside of the garment. The temperature tends to be lowest among above heating methods.|$|R

The four hands hold items with symbolic meaning — a pustaka (book or script), a mala (rosary, garland), a water pot and a musical instrument (lute or vina).

A mālā of crystals, representing the power <b>of</b> meditation, a <b>pot</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> represents powers <b>to</b> purify the right from wrong.

40|$|Pereskia aculeata Mill., {{popularly known}} in Brazil as &# 8220;Ora-pro-nobis&# 8221;, is an {{unconventional}} edible vegetable. Taking into account {{its potential for}} agronomic cultivation, this study aimed to evaluate the growth response of this plant under intermittent drought through controlled reductions in the substrate matric potential, in a greenhouse. Treatments consisted of adding to the <b>pots</b> a volume <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> raise the matric potential to - 5 kPa, according <b>to</b> the <b>water</b> retention curve in the substrate, whenever the mean substrate matric potential reached values between - 10 kPa and - 70 kPa, depending on the treatment. At 140 days after transplanting, leaf area and dry mass of leaves, stems and roots were determined. The intermittent reduction of the matric potential in the root zone of &# 8220;Ora-pro-nobis&# 8221; affected less the dry mass accumulation in leaves (reduction of 21. 4 %) than in stems (reduction of 48. 1 %) and roots (reduction of 63. 7 %), and that is interesting because leaves are the main commercial product of this plant. The treatment also modified the proportionality of dry mass allocation among plant parts and reduced the photosynthetic efficiency of leaves, fact evidenced by the linear increase of the specific leaf area (0. 63 cm 2 g- 1 kPa- 1) and leaf area ratio (0. 39 cm- 2 g- 1 kPa- 1), although not affecting directly the leaf area...|$|R
