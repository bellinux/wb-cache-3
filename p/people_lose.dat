25|$|Rephrasing {{refers to}} skills in which leader repeats what others are saying for more {{clarification}} during a group discussion. The focus group leader typically asks group members for more in-depth opinions after rephrasing. It allows group members {{to have a}} broad perspective in order to view topics from different angles and interpretations. Emotional Control refers to the group leader’s ability to control his or her emotions {{in order for the}} discussion to be effective. It requires developing a tough skin {{to be able to take}} on the lead in the discussion when <b>people</b> <b>lose</b> their tempers. Leaders must aim to diffuse anger and redirect the emotions with constructive analysis and suggestions. S/he must allow providing an avenue to release all the emotions within constructively. After dealing with emotions, the leader must redirect the focus of group discussion.|$|E
25|$|Forums {{prefer a}} premise of open and free {{discussion}} and often adopt de facto standards. Most common topics on forums include questions, comparisons, polls of opinion {{as well as}} debates. It {{is not uncommon for}} nonsense or unsocial behavior to sprout as <b>people</b> <b>lose</b> temper, especially if the topic is controversial. Poor understanding of differences in values of the participants is a common problem on forums. Because replies to a topic are often worded aimed at someone's point of view, discussion will usually go slightly off into several directions as people question each other's validity, sources and so on. Circular discussion and ambiguity in replies can extend for several tens of posts of a thread eventually ending when everyone gives up or attention spans waver and a more interesting subject takes over. It is not uncommon for debate to end in ad hominem attacks.|$|E

25|$|The {{comparative}} use of Census Bureau data, {{as well as}} most {{sources of}} demographic income data, has been questioned by statisticians for being unable to account for 'mobility of incomes'. At any given time, the Census Bureau ranks all households by household income and then divides this distribution of households into quintiles. The highest-ranked household in each quintile provides the upper income limit for each quintile. Comparing changes in these upper income limits for different quintiles is how changes are measured between one moment in time and the next. The problem with inferring income inequality on this basis is that the census statistics provide only a snapshot of income distribution in the U.S., at individual points in time. The statistics do not reflect the reality that income for many households changes over time – i.e., incomes are mobile. For most people, income increases over time as they move from their first, low-paying job in high school to a better-paying job later in their lives. Also, some <b>people</b> <b>lose</b> income over time because of business-cycle contractions, demotions, career changes, retirement, etc. The implication of changing individual incomes is that individual households do not remain in the same income quintiles over time. Thus, comparing different income quintiles over time is like comparing apples to oranges, because it means comparing incomes of different people at different stages in their earnings profile.|$|E

[...] On 16June1993 the Court of Vesoul, and on 24March1994 the [...] Court of Appeal of Besançon, sentenced the church to pay court costs and damages to the CCMM. In a second complaint filed on 27November, the CCMM and the Centre Information Jeunesse in Haute-Saône were sued after distributing a publication critical of the church. Both complaints were dismissed. In 1996, the two appeals for cassation filed {{by the church}} were rejected; the court held that the CCMM's writings did not fall under defamation, said that damages to the church's honor were not proven, that [...] "no reproach can be done when CCMM called 'cult' the Evangelical Church of Pentecost", and that the association [...] "merely assesses the nature and trends of a religious community, reports some of its practices, including those relating to the disease healing and its methods of recruitment through agencies providing relief without indicating that they are the community's emanations".|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the iron}} in the body is hoarded and {{recycled}} by the reticuloendothelial system, which breaks down aged red blood cells. In contrast to iron uptake and recycling, there is no physiologic regulatory mechanism for excreting iron. <b>People</b> <b>lose</b> a small but steady amount by gastrointestinal blood loss, sweating and by shedding cells of the skin and the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract. The total amount of loss for healthy people {{in the developed world}} amounts to an estimated average of [...] a day for men, and 1.52mg a day for women with regular menstrual periods. People with gastrointestinal parasitic infections, more commonly found in developing countries, often lose more. Those who cannot regulate absorption well enough get disorders of iron overload.

2500|$|Retrograde amnesia is most {{marked for}} events {{occurring}} in the weeks or months before treatment, with one study showing that although some <b>people</b> <b>lose</b> memories from years prior to treatment, recovery of such memories was [...] "virtually complete" [...] by seven months post-treatment, with the only enduring loss being memories {{in the weeks and}} months prior to the treatment. Anterograde memory loss is usually limited to the time of treatment itself or shortly afterwards. In the weeks and months following ECT these memory problems gradually improve, but some people have persistent losses, especially with bilateral ECT. One published review summarizing the results of questionnaires about subjective memory loss found that between 29% and 55% of respondents believed they experienced long-lasting or permanent memory changes. In 2000, American psychiatrist Sarah Lisanby and colleagues found that bilateral ECT left patients with more persistently impaired memory of public events as compared to RUL ECT.|$|E
