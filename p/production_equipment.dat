5|$|As {{early as}} May 1941, the NDH had asked Germany for, among other things, 22 Messerschmitt Bf 109s. Instead, they {{got some of}} the {{remaining}} largely obsolete aircraft of the VVKJ. At the same time, Germany appropriated six captured Dornier Do 17K bombers, which were then supplied to Bulgaria. Romania received six ex-VVKJ Hawker Hurricanes, as well as six Bristol Blenheims, whilst Finland received 20 half-completed Blenheims, together with manufacturing tools and <b>production</b> <b>equipment,</b> as well as a huge variety of spare parts.|$|E
5|$|During {{the chaotic}} years of Solidarity and martial law, Poland entered {{a decade of}} {{economic}} crisis more pronounced than in Gierek's years. Work on the major unfinished projects that had begun in the 1970s drained the available investment outlays, little money was left for replacing obsolete <b>production</b> <b>equipment</b> and the manufactured goods were not competitive on the world market. Managerial ineffectiveness, bad organization of production and shortages of inputs and raw materials were among the factors that contributed to further deterioration of workers' morale. 640,000 people of productive age left the country between 1981 and 1988.|$|E
5|$|By 1945, {{due to a}} {{shrinking}} number of operational units and stepped up <b>production,</b> <b>equipment</b> shortages were {{a thing of the}} past. Indeed, the Army had more equipment that it actually needed. For example, a total of 368 25pounders were required for combat and 38 for training but there were a total of 1,516 on hand. Additionally, a total of 530 2pounder and 6pounder anti-tank guns were required, but the Army had 1,941, while 68 3.7inch anti-aircraft guns were needed for combat and five for training, but there were 640 pieces available. Similar surpluses existed with small arms such as the Bren, of which 9,438 were required, but there were 21,139 in the system. The situation in relation to Bren gun carriers was even more marked with only 123 of the 3,767 vehicles actually being required, due to the decreased requirements for mobility vehicles in jungle warfare.|$|E

25|$|The M5 Half-track (officially the Carrier, Personnel Half-track M5) was an American armored {{personnel}} carrier in use during World War II. It {{was developed in}} 1942 when existing manufacturers of the M2 Half Track Car, and M3 Half-track could {{not keep up with}} production demand. International Harvester (IH) had capacity to produce a similar vehicle to the M3, but some differences from it had to be accepted due to different <b>production</b> <b>equipment.</b> The M5 was produced by IH from December 1942 to October 1943.|$|E
25|$|Using {{standard}} IC {{packaging and}} test facilities (called subcons in the IC industry) gives MEMS oscillators production scalability. These facilities {{are capable of}} large production volumes, often {{hundreds of millions of}} ICs per day. This capacity is shared across many IC companies, so ramping production volumes of specific ICs, or in this case specific MEMS oscillators, is a function of allocating standard <b>production</b> <b>equipment.</b> Conversely, quartz oscillator factories are single-function in nature, so that ramping production requires installing custom equipment, which is more costly and time consuming than allocating standard equipment.|$|E
25|$|Forging {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} known {{metalworking}} processes. Traditionally, forging was performed by a smith using hammer and anvil, though introducing water power to the production and working of iron in the 12th century allowed the use of large trip hammers or power hammers that exponentially increased the amount and size of iron that could be produced and forged easily. The smithy or forge has evolved over centuries to become a facility with engineered processes, <b>production</b> <b>equipment,</b> tooling, raw materials and products to meet the demands of modern industry.|$|E

In late 1983, the United States Department of Defense inquired about the Glock pistol and received four samples of the Glock 17 for unofficial evaluation.
