Small-interfering RNA-mediated reduction of endogenous Cbl restored STAP- 2 <b>protein</b> <b>levels.</b> In contrast, over-expression of Cbl induced STAP- 2 degradation. Importantly, Cbl-mediated regulation of STAP- 2 <b>protein</b> <b>levels</b> affected Brk/STAP- 2 -induced STAT 3 activation.

40|$|Regulator of G protein {{signaling}} 2 (RGS 2), a Gq-specific GT-Pase-activating protein, {{is strongly}} implicated in cardiovascular function. RGS 2 (/) mice are hypertensive {{and prone to}} heart failure, and several rare human mutations that accelerate RGS 2 degradation have been identified among patients with hyper-tension. Therefore, pharmacological up-regulation of RGS 2 <b>protein</b> <b>levels</b> might be beneficial. We used a -galactosidase complementation method to screen several thousand com-pounds with known pharmacological functions for those that increased RGS 2 <b>protein</b> <b>levels.</b> Several cardiotonic steroids (CTSs), including ouabain and digoxin, increased RGS 2 but not RGS 4 <b>protein</b> <b>levels.</b> CTSs increased RGS 2 <b>protein</b> <b>levels</b> through a post-transcriptional mechanism, by slowing protein degradation. RGS 2 mRNA levels in primary vascular smooth muscle cells were unaffected by CTS treatment, whereas pro-tein levels were increased 2 - to 3 -fold. Na/K-ATPase was required for the increase in RGS 2 <b>protein</b> <b>levels,</b> because the effect was lost in Na/K-ATPase-knockdown cells. Further-more, we demonstrated that CTS-induced increases in RGS 2 levels were functional and reduced receptor-stimulated, Gq-dependent, extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphoryla-tion. Finally, we showed that in vivo treatment with digoxin led to increased RGS 2 <b>protein</b> <b>levels</b> in heart and kidney. CTS-induced increases in RGS 2 <b>protein</b> <b>levels</b> and function might modify several deleterious mechanisms in hypertension and heart failure. This novel CTS mechanism might contribute to the beneficial actions of low-dose digoxin treatment in heart failure.

Specifically, both IL- 6 and BDNF <b>protein</b> <b>levels</b> were higher in high-risk compared to low-risk offspring. We also found that <b>protein</b> <b>levels</b> of candidate genes changed over the clinical stages of illness development. Specifically, we found a significant difference in IL- 6 and BDNF <b>protein</b> <b>levels</b> between high-risk offspring in the early compared to the later stages of illness development. While only differences between high-risk and control offspring for BDNF <b>protein</b> <b>levels</b> remained significant after adjustment, this was likely due to the small sample size.

40|$|Summary To study DNA topoisomerase IIα (Topo-IIα) and-β {{expression}} and regulation in human ovarian cancer, 15 ovarian tumour samples were investigated. To compare {{different levels of}} expression, the samples were screened for topo IIα and-β mRNA with Northern blotting and a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for Topo-IIα mRNA. Additionally, <b>protein</b> <b>levels</b> were determined with Western blotting and topoisomerase II activity levels with the decatenation assay. The results obtained were compared {{with each other and}} with the tumour volume index of the samples. In tumours with a tumour volume index ≥ 50 %, the mRNA levels (as determined by Northern blotting) and <b>protein</b> <b>levels</b> for each isozyme were in accordance. Additionally, correlations were found between Topo-IIα RT-PCR data and Topo-IIα Northern blot results, and between Topo-IIα RT-PCR data and Topo-IIα <b>protein</b> <b>levels.</b> Interestingly, Topo-IIβ <b>protein</b> <b>levels</b> correlated better with Topo-II activity than Topo-IIα <b>protein</b> <b>levels.</b> In eight ovarian cystadenoma samples, no Topo-IIα protein could be found. In only three out of eight of these cystadenomas, Topo-IIβ protein could be detected.

25|$|The tumor-suppressor protein p53 accumulates when DNA {{is damaged}} {{due to a}} chain of {{biochemical}} factors. Part of this pathway includes alpha-interferon and beta-interferon, which induce transcription of the p53 gene, resulting in the increase of p53 <b>protein</b> <b>level</b> and enhancement of cancer cell-apoptosis. p53 prevents the cell from replicating by stopping the cell cycle at G1, or interphase, to give the cell time to repair, however it will induce apoptosis if damage is extensive and repair efforts fail. Any disruption to the regulation of the p53 or interferon genes will result in impaired apoptosis and the possible formation of tumors.|$|E
25|$|Diploid organisms contain {{two copies}} of each gene. If these are {{different}} (heterozygous / heteroallelic), the two different copies of the allele may {{interact with each other}} to cause epistasis. This is sometimes called allelic complementation, or interallelic complementation. It may be caused by several mechanisms, for example transvection, where an enhancer from one allele acts in trans to activate transcription from the promoter of the second allele. Alternately, trans-splicing of two non-functional RNA molecules may produce a single, functional RNA.

25|$|PIKKs {{have four}} domains at the <b>protein</b> <b>level,</b> which {{distinguish}} them from other protein kinases. From the N-terminus to the C-terminus, these domains are named FRAP-ATM-TRAAP (FAT), the kinase domain (KD), the PIKK-regulatory domain (PRD), and the FAT-C-terminal (FATC). The FAT domain, consisting of four α-helices, is N-terminal to KD, but that part {{is referred to}} as the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain, which binds the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. The FAT domain consists of repeats, referred to as HEAT (Huntingtin, Elongation factor 3, A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A and TOR1). Specific protein activators regulate the PIKK kinases but binding of them to the kinase complex causes a conformational change that increases substrate access to the kinase domain.|$|E

Methods Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 114 lung cancer patients and 100 healthy control subjects. MMP- 7 <b>protein</b> <b>levels</b> in the plasma were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results The plasma <b>protein</b> <b>levels</b> of MMP- 7 in lung cancer patients (median= 0. 72 ng/mL) were significantly higher than those in healthy control subjects (median= 0. 30 ng/mL) (P 0. 05).

25|$|One might further {{hypothesize that}} the {{experimental}} treatment regulates cholesterol, because the treatment seems to selectively regulate genes associated with cholesterol. While {{this may be}} true, {{there are a number}} of reasons why making this a firm conclusion based on enrichment alone represents an unwarranted leap of faith. One previously mentioned issue has to do with the observation that gene regulation may have no direct impact on protein regulation: even if the proteins coded for by these genes do nothing other than make cholesterol, showing that their mRNA is altered does not directly tell us what is happening at the <b>protein</b> <b>level.</b> It is quite possible that the amount of these cholesterol-related proteins remains constant under the experimental conditions. Second, even if protein levels do change, perhaps there is always enough of them around to make cholesterol as fast as it can be possibly made, that is, another protein, not on our list, is the rate determining step in the process of making cholesterol. Finally, proteins typically play many roles, so these genes may be regulated not because of their shared association with making cholesterol but because of a shared role in a completely independent process.|$|E
