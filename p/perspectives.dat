40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{psychological}} research has investigated the influence of <b>perspective</b> taking on individuals, indicating that <b>perspective</b> taking increases {{the extent to which}} people like, feel a sense of self–other overlap with, and help those whose <b>perspective</b> they take. However, previous investigations of the topic have been limited {{to the study of the}} <b>perspective</b> taker, rather than the individual whose <b>perspective</b> has been taken. The purpose of the current work is to begin to fill this large gap in the literature by examining the consequences of believing that another individual is taking one’s <b>perspective,</b> a phenomenon we refer to as perceived <b>perspective</b> taking. Over a series of 6 experiments, we demonstrate that perceiving that one’s <b>perspective</b> has been taken confers many of the same interpersonal benefits as taking another’s <b>perspective.</b> Specifically, our data suggest that believing that another person has successfully taken one’s <b>perspective</b> results in an increased liking for, a greater sense of self–other overlap with, and more help provided to that person. Consistent with predictions, we find that one’s self–other overlap with the <b>perspective</b> taker and the amount of empathy one perceives the <b>perspective</b> taker to feel operate in tandem to mediate the link between perceived <b>perspective</b> taking and liking for the <b>perspective</b> taker. Further, a mediational path from perceived <b>perspective</b> taking to helping behavior through liking is supported. Future directions are discussed, along with implications for theory and application in domains such as intergroup relations, conflict resolution, and political campaigning...|$|R

40|$|The {{main subject}} of the thesis is linear <b>perspective</b> and various <b>perspective</b> {{instruments}} or gadgets. The focus is mostly directed in one specific <b>perspective</b> instrument, the so called Dϋrer <b>perspective</b> window, which I integrate in the contemporary or modern ways of teaching the linear <b>perspective</b> in elementary schools. Within the theoretical part of the thesis I am dealing with the basic factors {{which led to the}} very beginning of portraying space using linear <b>perspective.</b> Many typical <b>perspective</b> constructions are highlighted, together with their advantages and shortcomings. I study the <b>perspective</b> armatures of different paintings which occurred at that time. I also talk about basic <b>perspective</b> art features typical for certain parts of Europe. The last chapter is dedicated to <b>perspective</b> instruments. The theoretical part of the thesis represents a meaningful background for the practical section. In the mentioned second section I conduct a so called action research about reasonableness of using the Dϋrer <b>perspective</b> window as a teaching widget when teaching linear <b>perspective</b> in the ninth grade of elementary school. Using the qualitative research paradigm, I analyze <b>perspective</b> drawings of students; the first step of analysis is done after the conventional lecture. The second step of analysis takes place after an upgraded lecture in which I teach <b>perspective</b> using the Dϋrer <b>perspective</b> window. After the separated observation of each drawing, a comparative analysis is done for each student. By comparing drawings after both lectures possible progress is determined. During the process the extensiveness of the subject of <b>perspective</b> drawing is considered at all time and it also corresponds with the curriculum and prescribed literature. Based on the results of the research, several conclusions are made, legitimating the use of the Dϋrer <b>perspective</b> window in the teaching practice allowing and encouraging its multilateralism and the very motion of lecturing...|$|R
5000|$|In {{abnormal}} psychology, cognitive {{disorders are}} mental disorders that develop {{on the basis}} of cognitive mental disorder <b>perspective.</b> The cognitive mental disorder <b>perspective</b> is the theory that psychological disorders originate from an interruption, whether short or long, in our basic cognitive functions, i.e. memory processing, perception, problem solving and language. This <b>perspective</b> takes opposition to the psychodynamic mental disorder <b>perspective,</b> behavioral mental disorder <b>perspective,</b> sociocultural mental disorder <b>perspective,</b> interpersonal mental disorder <b>perspective</b> and neurological/biological mental disorder <b>perspective.</b> One pioneer of cognitive disorder <b>perspective</b> is Albert Ellis. In 1962, Ellis proposed that humans develop irrational beliefs/goals about the world; and therefore, create disorders in cognitive abilities. Another pioneer of the cognitive disorder <b>perspective</b> is Aaron Beck. In 1967, Beck designed {{what is known as the}} [...] "cognitive model" [...] for emotional disorders, mainly depression. His model showed that a blending of negative cognitive functions about the self, the world, and possible selves lead to cognitive mental disorders.|$|R
40|$|We {{can imagine}} looking at {{ourselves}} (observer <b>perspective)</b> or through our own eyes (field <b>perspective).</b> Cognitive and clinical theories suggest that compared to field <b>perspective,</b> observer <b>perspective</b> imagery reduces emotional intensity, for example, of trauma memories.

Using contrasting experimental manipulations, participants imagined 100 positive descriptions from either (1) a field <b>perspective</b> or (2) an observer <b>perspective,</b> or (3) thought about their verbal meaning. Affect was more positive after field than observer imagery and verbal conditions, with mood deterioration within the latter two. Findings {{are the first to}} demonstrate causality of imagery <b>perspective</b> on emotion. Further, the results demonstrate that imagining positive events from one's own <b>perspective</b> is critical to improving positive affect. Treatment implications include promoting field imagery to facilitate a more rose-tinted view of positive events...|$|R
