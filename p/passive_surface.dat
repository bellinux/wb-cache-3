[...] It wasn't {{certainly}} as if his nature had been soft, so that pin-pricks would draw blood from it; and from the first of her acquaintance with him, and of her having to defend herself against a certain air that he had of knowing better what was good for her than she knew herself, she had recognised the fact that perfect frankness was her best weapon.

40|$|NOVELTY - The {{arrangement}} includes {{at least}} two lenses or lens groups arranged on a common optic axis, which are coupled with piezoelectric or electro-restrictive, linear drives, whereby an active material surface area, undergoing micro-deformation, faces a <b>passive</b> material <b>surface</b> area. At {{least one of the}} linear drives comprises two parallel, active material surface areas, between which the <b>passive</b> material <b>surface</b> areas are arranged. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The arrangement includes {{at least two}} lenses or lens groups arranged on a common optic axis, whose positions are individually or commonly in direction of the optic axis, adjustable in reference to an assembly group connected firmly with an optic instrument. The lenses or lens groups are coupled with piezoelectric or electro-restrictive, linear drives to provide a position change, whereby an active material surface area, undergoing micro-deformation, faces a <b>passive</b> material <b>surface</b> area, and whereby a movement of both material sur face areas is triggered with respect to each other. At least one of the linear drives comprises two even, parallel to each other arranged, active material surface areas, whose micro-deformations are directed towards each other, and between which the <b>passive</b> material <b>surface</b> areas are arranged. The active material surface areas are triggered simultaneously, whereby the micro-deformations of both active material surface areas are directed simultaneously towards the <b>passive</b> material <b>surface</b> areas. USE - None given. ADVANTAGE - Provides improved accuracy and effective transmission of energy from active to <b>passive</b> material <b>surface</b> areas...|$|R

For Thurnauer, a painting is not simply a <b>passive</b> <b>surface</b> displaying an image. Rather, it is a means to an active experience for the viewer.

50|$|Pitting Corrosion {{is defined}} by {{localised}} attack (microns - millimetres in diameter) in an otherwise <b>passive</b> <b>surface</b> and only occurs for specific alloy / environment combinations. Thus, this type of corrosion typically occurs in alloys that are protected by a tenacious (passivating) oxide film such as stainless steels, nickel alloys, aluminium alloys in environments that contain an aggressive species such as chlorides (Cl-). In contrast, alloy / environment combinations where the passive film is not very protective usually will not produce pitting corrosion. A {{good example of the}} importance of environment / alloy combinations is carbon steel. In environments where the pH is less than 10, carbon steel does not form a passivating oxide film and the addition of chloride results in uniform attack over the entire surface. However, at pH greater than 10 (alkaline) the oxide is very protecting and the addition of chloride results in pitting corrosion.|$|E
50|$|Common {{among all}} of the {{different}} specifications and types are the following steps: Prior to passivation, the object must be cleaned of any contaminants and generally must undergo a validating test {{to prove that the}} surface is 'clean.' The object is then placed in an acidic passivating bath that meets the temperature and chemical requirements of the method and type specified between customer and vendor. (Temperatures can range from ambient to 60 degrees C {140 degrees F}), while minimum passivation times are usually 20 to 30 minutes). The parts are neutralized using a bath of aqueous sodium hydroxide, then rinsed with clean water and dried. The <b>passive</b> <b>surface</b> is validated using humidity, elevated temperature, a rusting agent (salt spray), or some combination of the three. However, proprietary passivation processes exist for martensitic stainless steel, which is difficult to passivate, as microscopic discontinuities can form in the surface of a machined part during passivation in a typical nitric acid bath. The passivation process removes exogenous iron, creates/restores a passive oxide layer that prevents further oxidation (rust), and cleans the parts of dirt, scale, or other welding-generated compounds (e.g. oxides).|$|E

Starting from different initial conditions, a single framework allows one to describe generalised corrosion, localised corrosion, reactive and <b>passive</b> <b>surfaces,</b> including occluded corrosion phenomena as well. Spontaneous spatial separation of anodic and cathodic zones is associated with bare metal and passivated metal on the surface. This separation is also related to local acidification of the solution.

This technique allows emissivity measurements of newly developed variable emissivity surfaces, including electrostatic devices which cannot be directly measured using optical techniques. It can measure both passive and active thermal control coatings, and can evaluate many surfaces on the same substrate simultaneously. An experimental setup is detailed and results are presented for emissivity measurements of both active and <b>passive</b> <b>surfaces</b> using commercially available heat flux sensors.
