In September 1930, George Lehberger devised the basic concept of tilt rotor aircraft, that is, a relatively low disc loading thruster (propeller) that can tilt its axis from the vertical (for vertical lift) to the horizontal (for <b>propulsive</b> <b>thrust).</b> On September 16, 1930, Lehberger was issued U.S. patent #1,775,861.|$|E

We find that C. elegans delivers <b>propulsive</b> <b>thrusts</b> {{on the order of}} a few nanonewtons. Such findings are supported by values obtained using resistive force theory; the ratio of normal to tangential drag coefficients is estimated to be approximately 1. 4. Over the range of solutions investigated here, the flow properties remain largely independent of viscosity. Velocity magnitudes of the flow away from the nematode body decay rapidly within less than a body length and collapse onto a single master curve.

40|$|The {{walking and}} surface film {{locomotion}} of a terrestrial spider, Lycosa rabida Walckenaer, and a semi-aquatic spider, Dolomedes triton (Walckenaer), are compared. Stepping patterns during locomotion on a solid substrate resemble an alternating tetrapod in both species. L. rabida retains {{elements of the}} terrestrial gait when moving on water: <b>propulsive</b> <b>thrusts</b> are concentrated at the tarsi and intra-segmental legs step in alternation. However, protraction/retraction (p/r) values are generally greater and phase values of adjacent ipsilateral legs are lower compared to values for walking animals. D. triton shows greater behavioural specialization for aquatic locomotion: propulsive forces are generated {{along the length of}} the leg, intrasegmental legs move in synchrony and leg 4 (which is not used for propulsion on water) functions in yaw correction. Changes in p/r value and ipsilateral phase accompanying the transition from a solid substrate to the water surface are similar to those found in L. rabida. The fact that coordination within a segment and co-ordination between segments can be altered independently in both proximate and evolutionary time suggests that interleg coupling in spiders is governed by two distinct mechanisms: intrasegmental and intersegmental mechanisms. It is sugges-ted that proximate changes in p/r value and ipsilateral phase in both spiders may be the effect of sensory modulation of similar motor control mechanisms and that certain specializations for aquatic locomotion in D. triton (such as yaw corrective movements of leg 4) are derived from elements of the primitive terrestrial motor programme...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In liquid {{propellant}} engines, the propellants (fuel and oxidizer) after passing the injectors, are injected to combustion chamber. Generally, in {{liquid propellant}} engines, {{two types of}} injectors – direct flow and centrifugal flow – are used. The direct flow injector, actuates as an orifice. The input flow to a centrifugal injector, gets the angular momentum and goes out conically. The angular momentum causes the powdering of output fluid. The injecting cones collide {{to each other and}} the mixing operation is accomplished. The mixing and powdering of droplets in the centrifugal injectors are accomplished better than the direct flow injectors. To this reason, in modern liquid propellant engines, the centrifugal injectors are used. The centrifugal injectors are divided to two types: one component and two components. At one component injectors, the fuel and oxidizer are injected separately, but at two components injectors, both oxidizer and fuel are injected from a complex structure. The injection rate at injector plate, is one of the effective parameters on wall’s cooling, combustion stability and <b>propulsive</b> force (<b>thrust)</b> in the combustion chamber.

The objective is to investigate {{the effect of the}} distance of the tail and its angle of attack on the overall <b>propulsive</b> efficiency, <b>thrust</b> and lift. An immersed boundary method Navier-Stokes solver is used for the simulation. Results show that efficiency and average thrust can be increased up to 10 % and 25 % respectively when a stationary airfoil is placed downstream. The simulations reveal how the vortex-shedding pattern of the airfoils are affected by the interaction between them. As the angle of attack of this airfoil increases from 0 to 45 o, high lift is generated at the expense of rapidly decreasing efficiency and thrust. The results are not very sensitive to the shape of the airfoil; similar results are obtained with a flat plate airfoil. Lastly, a simple optimization study is performed to obtain the configuration which gave the best performance based on the range of parameters studied.
