40|$|Aftermarket {{services}} in the automotive industry bring profitable advantages to manufacturing firms and are a major enabler to secure customer loyalty by providing value-adding services through the product life-cycle. High uptime of vehicles {{is one of the}} key performance indicators as it increases customer satisfaction which is the fundamentals for long-term relationship with the end-customer. Demand for spare parts is difficult to monitor as breakdown services can occur at an unpredictable time. Therefore, it is challenging for many OEM’s to contribute to high availability of spare parts in a cost efficient way. Today there is data available from connected vehicle technology to facilitate <b>pre-planned</b> services activities and to avoid breakdown situations. The Volvo Group has implemented <b>pre-planning</b> to their aftermarket supply chain but as the amount of <b>pre-planned</b> service activities is not performed in a high degree the company is uncertain about the impact from this concept. The purpose of this thesis was formulated to investigate the impact from higher degree of <b>pre-planned</b> service activities on the aftermarket supply chain in order to identify future performance potential. The thesis was conducted as a case study at the Volvo Group. Three research questions were stated in order to identify scenarios where <b>pre-planning</b> has impact on the spare part control; 1) identify the effect from current spare part control practices and performance in the aftermarket supply chain, 2) identify how <b>pre-planned</b> service activities affect the current spare part control, and 3) identify the opportunities and obstacles for future performance potential on different spare part control scenarios. The current aftermarket supply chain at the Volvo Group was investigated and analysed to find the practices and performance indicators that are affected by the current spare part control and their relevance to higher uptime and decreased lead time, transportation cost and tied-up inventory was evaluated. Characteristics of <b>pre-planning</b> were conducted from literature and benchmarking study from the automotive industry was made to estimate effects from <b>pre-planned</b> service activities on the current spare part control. Historical sales data from two dealers was analysed in order to understand current behaviour from the dealer side. Furthermore, potential <b>pre-planning</b> scenarios and their effects were identified to visualize direct impact from higher degree of <b>pre-planned</b> service activities. The results from this thesis give a clear description on how <b>pre-planned</b> service activities impact the current spare part control. It has the potential to contribut e to higher uptime of the vehicle with reduction of inventory levels at dealers and supporting warehouses, and total transportation cost. Furthermore, it identifies potential planning scenarios where <b>pre-planning</b> will have different impact from different segments of parts. The greatest impact are from faster moving segments of spare parts, that represent the majority of sold parts, and supports the potentials of reduction of total inventory cost, transportation cost, and higher turnover rate at dealers’ stocks...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} we analyze {{the reasons for}} {{changing}} <b>pre-planned</b> activities and travels episodes considering the type of modification observed during the scheduling process. Specifically we selected a small sample from those <b>pre-planned</b> episodes that are no executed at all as a pilot study. The data analyzed was collected in {{the first wave of}} a weekly activity-travel panel survey carried out in Valencia (Spain) in 2010. Each survey wave consisted on a face-to-face interview to generate a <b>pre-planned</b> activity agenda for the following week, an activity-travel diary implemented on mobile phones to collect activities and travels as they are executed, and in-depth telephone interviews to inquire about differences between <b>pre-planned</b> agenda and observed activities and travels. This methodology allowed to collect data related to how respondents <b>pre-planned</b> activity-travel episodes and how they re-scheduled them before execution. Observed modification types provide us with information about their spatio-temporal and social flexibility. Open-ended records collected in the in-depth telephone interviews, were coded and provided a semi-formal segmentation and categorization of the changing process as the basis of our study. Spatio-temporal and social constraints, biological needs and resource constraints are differentiated along with facets of the activity-travel episodes and socio-demographic characteristics of respondents...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in the characterization and modelling of activity scheduling and re-scheduling behaviour. In this paper, a specific aspect of that research stream is studied: the resolution of activity scheduling conflicts. Using empirical data collected in an Internet survey, the modification of the <b>pre-planned</b> activities' duration to accommodate a new activity in the schedule was analysed. That schedule adjustment was studied as an end-of-duration process using a parametric hazard duration modelling approach. The {{results indicate that the}} process of lengthening/shortening the earlier <b>pre-planned</b> activity depends on the amount of modification of the <b>pre-planned</b> activity's duration. But {{this is not the case}} of the later <b>pre-planned</b> activity, which is not a function of how much the duration was modified. The characteristics of both the implicated activities and the schedule modification are the most important factors that explain the process of schedule change. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{standard}} approach in interventional treatment of atrial fibrilla-tion (AFib) is pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). PVI {{can be achieved}} by placing radio-frequency (RF) lesions contiguously around the pulmonary veins attached to the left atrium. Since accurate lesion placement may be difficult, <b>pre-planned</b> ablation lines can be used for better navigation both when using mapping systems or also when relying on fluoro overlay techniques. By working with physicians in this field, we learned that clinically acceptable ablation lines are not necessarily limited to a unique line, but there appears to be some flexibility when defining regions within which ablation should be performed. We present a novel method to investigate the dimensions of such a region based on comparing <b>pre-planned</b> ablation lines set up for different left atria. A common reference model is proposed as a means to combine and compare different <b>pre-planned</b> abla-tion lines. Based on our data, we found an average deviation of individually <b>pre-planned</b> ablation lines from their respective mean of 2. 9 ± 1. 9 mm and 1. 8 ± 1. 5 mm for right and left sided ipsilat-eral planning lines, respectively. Beyond ablation line assessment, this work also introduces a framework which can be extended to automatic <b>pre-planning</b> of ablation lines for PVI procedures.
