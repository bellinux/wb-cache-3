Orbital and medial prefrontal cortices receive input from cortical and subcortical structures associated with emotions. Thus, the prefrontal cortex may be an essential link for autonomic responses driven by emotions. Classic studies have demonstrated the existence of projections between prefrontal cortex and the hypothalamus, a central autonomic structure, but the topographic organization of these connections in the monkey has not been clearly established. We investigated the organization of bidirectional connections between these areas in the rhesus monkey by using tracer injections in orbital, medial, and lateral <b>prefrontal</b> <b>areas.</b> All <b>prefrontal</b> <b>areas</b> investigated received projections from the hypothalamus, originating mainly in the posterior hypothalamus.

40|$|Studies on {{repetitive}} {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (rTMS) {{have shown}} that stimulating the parietal lobe, which {{plays a role in}} memory storage, can enhance performance during the “retention” process of working memory (WM). However, the mechanism of rTMS effect during this phase is still unclear. In this study, we stimulated the superior parietal lobe (SPL) using 5 -Hz rTMS in 26 participants and recorded electroencephalography (EEG) while they performed a delayed-recognition WM task. The analyses included the comparisons of event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) value variations in theta (4 – 7 Hz) and alpha (8 – 14 Hz) band frequencies between conditions (rTMS vs. sham), as well as the correlations between different brain areas. Following rTMS, the ERSP values of theta-band oscillations were significantly increased in the parietal and occipital-parietal brain areas (P < 0. 05 *), whereas the ERSP values of alpha-band oscillations were significantly decreased in the parietal area (P < 0. 05 *). The ERSP value variations of theta-band oscillations between the two conditions in the left parietal and left <b>prefrontal</b> <b>areas</b> were positively correlated with the response time (RT) variations (by using rTMS, the more subject RT decreased, the more ERSP value of theta oscillation increased). The ERSP value variations of alpha-band oscillations in the left parietal and bilateral <b>prefrontal</b> <b>areas</b> were negatively correlated with RT variations (by using rTMS, the more RT of the subject decreased, the more ERSP value of alpha oscillation decreased). Inter-sites phase synchronization of theta-band EEG between the left parietal and left <b>prefrontal</b> <b>areas,</b> as well as alpha-band EEG between the left parietal and bilateral <b>prefrontal</b> <b>areas</b> were enhanced by rTMS. These results indicated that activities of both parietal and <b>prefrontal</b> <b>areas</b> were required for information storage, and these activities were related to the behavioral responses.

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that in seven drug-resistant epilepsy patients, both reaching-grasping {{of objects and}} the mere observation of those actions did desynchronize subdural electrocorticographic (ECoG) alpha (8 - 13 Hz) and beta (14 - 30) rhythms {{as a sign of}} cortical activation in primary somatosensory-motor, lateral premotor and ventral <b>prefrontal</b> <b>areas</b> (Babiloni et al., 2016 a).

Results showed that the delta-theta (< 8 Hz) LLC between lateral premotor and ventral <b>prefrontal</b> <b>areas</b> was higher during action execution than during action observation. Furthermore, the phase of these delta-theta rhythms entrained the local event-related connectivity of alpha and beta rhythms.

40|$|Abstract 5 The {{amygdala}} {{has been}} implicated in processing information about the emotional signi¢cance {{of the environment and}} in the expression of emotions, through robust pathways with <b>prefrontal,</b> anterior temporal <b>areas,</b> and central autonomic structures. We investigated the anatomic organization and intersection of these pathways in the amygdala in rhesus monkeys with the aid of bidirectional, retrograde and anterograde tracers. Connections of the amygdala with orbitofrontal and medial <b>prefrontal</b> <b>areas</b> were robust and bidirectional, whereas connections with lateral <b>prefrontal</b> <b>areas</b> were sparse, unidirectional and ascending. Orbitofrontal axons terminated densely in a narrow band around the borders of the magnocellular baso-lateral nucleus, surrounded by projection neurons along a continuum through the nuclei of the basal complex. In contrast, the input and output zones of medial <b>prefrontal</b> <b>areas</b> were intermingled in the amygdala. Moreover, medial prefrontal axonal terminations were expansive, spreading into the parvicellular basolateral nucleus, which is robustly connected with hypothalamic autonomic structures, suggesting that they may in£uence the expressive emotional system of the amygdala. On the other hand, orbitofrontal axons heavily targeted the intercalated masses, which issue inhibitory projections to the central nucleus, at least in rats and cats. The central nucleus, in turn, issues a signi¢cant inhibitory projection to hypothalamic and brainstem autonomic structures. This evidence suggests that orbitofrontal areas exercise control on the internal processing of the amygdala. In addition, the results provided direct evidence that the connections of anterior temporal visual and auditory association cortices occupy overlapping territories with the orbitofrontal cortices particularly in the posterior half of th...|$|R

40|$|Working memory {{enables us}} to hold in our 'mind's eye' the {{contents}} of our conscious awareness, {{even in the absence}} of sensory input, by maintaining an active representation of information for a brief period of time. In this review we consider the functional organization of the prefrontal cortex and its role in this cognitive process. First, we present evidence from brain-imaging studies that prefrontal cortex shows sustained activity during the delay period of visual working memory tasks, indicating that this cortex maintains on-line representations of stimuli after they are removed from view. We then present evidence for domain specificity within frontal cortex based on the type of information, with object working memory mediated by more ventral frontal regions and spatial working memory mediated by more dorsal frontal regions. We also propose that a second dimension for domain specificity within prefrontal cortex might exist for object working memory on the basis of the type of representation, with analytic representations maintained preferentially in the left hemisphere and image-based representations maintained preferentially in the right hemisphere. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility that there are <b>prefrontal</b> <b>areas</b> brought into play during the monitoring and manipulation of information in working memory in addition to those engaged during the maintenance of this information. Finally, we consider the relationship of <b>prefrontal</b> <b>areas</b> important for working memory, both to posterior visual processing <b>areas</b> and to <b>prefrontal</b> <b>areas</b> associated with long-term memory...|$|R

Auditory imagery in general occurs across participants in the temporal voice area (TVA), which allows top-down imaging manipulations, processing, and storage of audition functions. Olfactory imagery research shows activation in the anterior piriform cortex and the posterior piriform cortex; experts in olfactory imagery have larger gray matter associated to olfactory areas. Tactile imagery is found {{to occur in the}} dorsolateral <b>prefrontal</b> <b>area,</b> inferior frontal gyrus, frontal gyrus, insula, precentral gyrus, and the medial frontal gyrus with basil ganglia activation in the ventral posteriomedial nucleus and putamen (hemisphere activation corresponds to the location of the imagined tactile stimulus). Research in gustatory imagery reveals activation in the anterior insular cortex, frontal operculum, and prefrontal cortex. Novices of a specific form of mental imagery show less gray matter than experts of mental imagery congruent to that form.

40|$|Cognitive {{hypotheses}} of hypnotic phenomena {{have proposed}} that executive attentional systems may be either inhibited or overactivated to produce a selective alteration or disconnection of some mental operations. Recent brain imaging studies have reported changes in activity in both medial (anterior cingulate) and lateral (inferior) <b>prefrontal</b> <b>areas</b> during hypnotically induced paralysis, overlapping with areas associated with attentional control as well as inhibitory processes. To compare motor inhibition mechanisms responsible for paralysis during hypnosis and those recruited by voluntary inhibition, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to record brain activity during a modified bimanual Go-Nogo task, which was performed either in a normal baseline condition or during unilateral paralysis caused by hypnotic suggestion or by simulation (in two groups of participants, each tested once with both hands valid and once with unilateral paralysis). This paradigm allowed us to identify patterns of neural activity specifically associated with hypnotically induced paralysis, relative to voluntary inhibition during simulation or Nogo trials. We used a topographical EEG analysis technique to investigate both the spatial organization and the temporal sequence of neural processes activated in these different conditions, and to localize the underlying anatomical generators through minimum-norm methods. We found that preparatory activations were similar in all conditions, despite left hypnotic paralysis, indicating preserved motor intentions.
