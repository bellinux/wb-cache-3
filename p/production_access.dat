40|$|The study {{investigates the}} {{relative}} importance of supply-side and demand-side factors of household food security through a logistic regression analysis applied to data collected from 247 sample households in Southern Ethiopia.

Among these, technological adoption, farming system, farm size, and land quality are supply-side factors. Household size, per capita aggregate <b>production,</b> and <b>access</b> to market are demand-side factors. Based on the magnitude of their partial effects on the probability of food security, supply-side factors are more powerful than the demand-side factors in determining household food security, implying that interventions focused on these factors need to get priority attention by policy, research and extension.
