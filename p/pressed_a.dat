5|$|After {{almost three}} years of touring to promote the album Metallica, {{including}} a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus {{in the summer of}} 1995 and played three outdoor shows that included headlining at Donington Park, where it was supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The short tour was titled Escape from the Studio '95. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number one album. The cover art of Load, called Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who <b>pressed</b> <b>a</b> mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; band members' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza in mid-1996.|$|E
5|$|In Radovich v. National Football League, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Radovich's favor and {{declared}} the NFL {{was subject to}} antitrust laws, and the implication was that {{the legality of the}} draft and reserve clause were dubious. Bell <b>pressed</b> <b>a</b> case in the media that the NFL should be exempted from antitrust regulations and proffered the league was a sport and not a business. He invited an investigation from Congress with respect to the court's ruling. The House Judiciary committee, chaired by Emanuel Celler—who believed the draft was illegal and should be abolished, convened in July 1957 to discuss the ramifications of the Radovich decision. Red Grange and Bell testified at the committee's solicitation and argued the draft was essential to the sport's success. Representatives of the NFLPA contradicted these statements and said the draft and the reserve clause were anti-labor, and it seemed as if Congress was going to accept their position. Faced with Congressional opposition, Bell formally recognized the NFLPA and declared he would negotiate with its representatives.|$|E

Arduous construction in difficult geological conditions proceeded. 34 workers were killed during construction. On 27 January 1983, Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone <b>pressed</b> <b>a</b> switch that set off a blast that completed the pilot tunnel.

He later visited the exposition; other notable guests included Herbert Hoover, Mae West, and Jack Dempsey.

25|$|On January 1, the {{commander}} of the XI Corps <b>pressed</b> <b>a</b> frontal attack on Sarikamish that lasted for the next four days; after that the fighting began to lose momentum. Snow hindered advancing forces which were supposed to bring relief. The IX Corps melted away on the way to Sarikamish. One of the divisions lost 40% of its strength in a snowstorm. The X Corps never came to the rescue. 90% of X Corps was left on the slopes of the Allahüekber Mountains. The XI Corps was fighting in the Aras region. A regiment entered Çerkezköy, only to be taken prisoner. While the Stange regiment entered Ardahan on schedule, the troops were exhausted. The Russians were poised to encircle the remaining forces.|$|E

25|$|When a key of the {{teleprinter}} keyboard is <b>pressed,</b> <b>a</b> 5-bit {{character is}} generated. The teleprinter converts it to serial format and transmits {{a sequence of}} a start bit (a logical 0 or space), then {{one after the other}} the 5 data bits, finishing with a stop bit (a logical 1 or mark, lasting 1, 1.5 or 2 bits). When a sequence of start bit, 5 data bits and stop bit arrives at the input of the teleprinter, it is converted to a 5-bit word and passed to the printer or VDU. With electromechanical teleprinters, these functions required complicated electromechanical devices, but they are easily implemented with standard digital electronics using shift registers. Special integrated circuits have been developed for this function, for example the Intersil 6402 and 6403. These are stand-alone UART devices, similar to computer serial port peripherals.|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} was to choose a single frequency {{for all of the}} IFF transponders to operate on, no matter what the radar system's natural frequency might be. The selected frequency was 180MHz, a little under the lowest of the existing 1.5m radars. The transponder radio was tuned only to this frequency, not the radar itself. The radar system also added a separate radio system for transmitting and receiving these pulses, the interrogator. When the radar operator <b>pressed</b> <b>a</b> button on their console, the interrogator began sending out pulses synchronised with those of the radar unit. The IFF unit in the target aircraft then responded with pulses with the same timing. The output of the interrogator's receiver was mixed with the radar's, causing the blip to extend as before. When this was added to the spiral scan display, instead of stretching the blip, the IFF signal appeared as a series of short line segments extending outward {{from the middle of the}} display, the sunrise pattern.|$|E
25|$|Peru is {{investigating}} claims that a beauty pageant contestant was lured to Gabon {{to become the}} lover of its 67-year-old president, Omar Bongo, and was stranded for nearly two weeks after she refused. A spokesman for Mr. Bongo said {{he was unaware of}} the allegations. The Peruvian Foreign Ministry said that Ivette Santa Maria, a 22-year-old Miss Peru America contestant, was invited to Gabon to be a hostess for a pageant there. In an interview, Ms. Santa Maria said that she was taken to Mr. Bongo's presidential palace hours after her Jan. 19 arrival and that as he joined her, he <b>pressed</b> <b>a</b> button and some sliding doors opened, revealing a large bed. She said, I told him I was not a prostitute, that I was a Miss Peru. She fled and guards offered to drive her to a hotel. Without money to pay the bill, however, she was stranded in Gabon for 12 days until international women's groups and others intervened.|$|E

25|$|Embarking in mid-October 1943, the {{battalion}} subsequently fought {{in a number}} of battles as it crossed the Sangro River and fought around Cassino, before advancing towards Florence and then up the Adriatic coast. In the final months of the war, the division advanced steadily, pushing over the Senio and then the Santerno Rivers towards the Alps, before being placed into reserve in April 1945 as the Allies pushed towards the Po River. In late April, the 22nd Battalion became the 5th Brigade's main effort, leading the advance towards the Piave River, where they found that all bridges had been destroyed. Improvising, {{the battalion}} <b>pressed</b> <b>a</b> local ferry into operation and after establishing a bridgehead {{on the other side of}} the river, continued the advance towards Trieste, fighting its final actions of the war against the Germans around Miramare. The battalion lost its final casualties when one of its companies was fired upon by Yugoslav partisans near Opicina after the end of hostilities.|$|E
25|$|The Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Toronto {{began in}} 1853, when the Ontario College of Pharmacy (now Pharmacists) who first {{operated}} {{at the school}} had merged into the school curriculum. By 1868, the pharmacy program consisted {{of only a few}} evenings of voluntary classes, with no practically prerequisite classes. However, the long, tradition apprenticeship of this professional field had <b>pressed</b> <b>a</b> strong emphasis onto the students. Today, the program has evolved into “a compulsory, four-year second-entry scientific and professional university course with a supervised period of professional practice.” The organization of this program has become significantly more structured. This change in focus strayed away from the predominant emphasis of the practice of training through an apprenticeship to today’s emphasis of a theoretical study and application of those skills in real-life situations. Students are better equipped with the skills which are required to meet the present needs of the profession. The University of Toronto was the only school in Ontario to offer a pharmacy education until the opening of the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy in 2008.|$|E
25|$|In 1957 Araúz co-founded Junta Nacional de la Comunion Tradicionalista, styled as formal body within {{mainstream}} Carlism; presiding it, he co-ordinated {{buildup of}} its local structures. He also co-founded Amigos de Maeztu, a monarchist lobbying group styled {{as a literary}} association, and became its vice-president {{and a member of}} Junta Directiva. His relations with Don Juan cooled; Araúz was disappointed by the claimant’s backtracking on his declared Traditionalist outlook, while Don Juan was disappointed by Araúz’s failure to bring all Carlists into his camp. Nevertheless, he remained a member of the juanist Consejo de la Corona and Consejo Privado (though not his Secretariado Político). As advisor to Don Juan he firmly opposed the democratic tendency. In 1961, when El Boletín de la Secretaria del Consejo Privado endorsed a monarchy based on parliamentary party politics, Araúz reacted with a letter to the Council’s head, José María Pemán, voicing his disgust. He presented the same stand in public debate. When ABC published a front-page piece of Rafael Calvo, pointing to a possible co-existence between liberalism and Catholicism, Araúz repelled the thesis. By mid-1960s Araúz discarded his anti-Francoism and <b>pressed</b> <b>a</b> collaborative strategy towards the regime, somewhat against a cautious approach favoured by Pemán and other juanista leaders.|$|E

25|$|Churchill refused, {{requiring}} the attack to continue, and Carden planned to continue but then collapsed from a rupturing ulcer. His second in command, Admiral John de Robeck {{took over and}} <b>pressed</b> <b>a</b> further attack on 18 March, but this failed when the trawler minesweepers crewed by Royal Naval Volunteer Reserves (i.e. civilian seamen) came under attack and then the battleships ran into a mine field (three were sunk). De Robeck did not repeat the attacks, later giving his reason as concerns over {{what would happen if}} his ships succeeded in clearing a way through the strait, but then became trapped in the Sea of Marmora without any troops to occupy captured territory. Churchill had anticipated the loss of ships: the battleships were mainly chosen because they were obsolete and unfit to face modern German ships, and he believed that the attack should have continued. Commodore Roger Keyes (Carden's chief of staff) believed that with destroyers fitted for minesweeping, and with naval personnel manning the trawlers, the mines could have been removed. These improvements were carried out, but never tried against the defences. It was also reported {{at the time that the}} defences were short of ammunition, and now seems likely that at least some of guns, particularly the largest, would have been forced to cease firing the following day.|$|E
25|$|A {{new report}} in January 2002 {{revealed}} that Few had ordered no new firefighting or emergency services {{vehicles in the}} past 18 months, and that the city's fleet was quickly approaching decrepitude. A third of all pumper trucks were out of service due to ill-repair and age, and the city was patching up 15-year-old vehicles (which were due to have been scrapped four years ago) to fight fires. Not a single pumper could be held in reserve to fight major fires {{due to the lack}} of vehicles. In one case, the city <b>pressed</b> <b>a</b> fire academy training vehicle into service because it ran out of pumpers. (Reserve pumpers had fallen to 11 in 2002 from 13 in July 2000, five fewer than required.) The department was also short three of the eight ladder trucks required for reserves. Few blamed city officials for not releasing $1.8 million to buy six new pumpers, even though he spent $32,000 to purchase a new command vehicle and an undisclosed sum to buy himself and other commanders 14 new cars. The report also showed that fire truck drivers were inadequately trained and poorly supervised, and were having too many accidents. Because of the lack of reserve vehicles, drivers also continued to operate vehicles even though they should have turned them in for repair. This worsened the repair issues when the vehicle finally failed. Although Few ordered the six pumpers by June 2002, there were still too few trucks in reserve.|$|E
