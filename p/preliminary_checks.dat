First, a decomposed scheme is considered which exploits the bordered block diagonal structure of the original Jacobian involved in the Newton iterations, and keeps the resulting “local ” Jacobians constant over multiple iterations. Next, a localization technique is considered, allowing to perform less iterations on the system components with lower activ-ity. Finally, a third scheme consists of visiting only a sub-set of components, identified as active, and skipping the other ones, identified as latent. The first two techniques solve the whole set of equations with the required accu-racy, while the third one involves an adjustable degree of approximation. The methods are illustrated on a small sys-tem, while <b>preliminary</b> <b>checks</b> of computational savings from a large test system are reported.

Minor corrections for phasing are also performed in the program. In order to identify inefficiencies in the startup, each is timed and parameter changes are logged so that system drifts can be tracked.

30|$|The {{first step}} in the {{conversion}} from accelerometer measurements to densities is the calibration of the data. On Swarm, this has proven to be more complicated than on previous missions, due to the presence and magnitude of various disturbances in the data. The three satellites are not identical in terms of the level of these disturbances. We found that acceleration measurements of Swarm A contain more disturbances than those of Swarm B and C. Furthermore, we observed that the acceleration measurements of Swarm B have a lower signal-to-noise rather than those of Swarm A and C, which is caused by the higher altitude of Swarm B as well as larger noise in the acceleration measurements of Swarm B. We have therefore focused our efforts primarily on Swarm C. We have also focused on the accelerometer x axis measurements, which contains the largest signal that is useful for deriving thermospheric densities since the x axis is roughly pointing into flight direction. We have furthermore started the processing of data from June 1, 2014, onward, in order to eliminate data affected by frequent maneuvers and other special operations from the launch and early orbit phase and satellite commissioning phases before that time. So far, we have processed data until May 31, 2015. Further data of Swarm C after this date will be processed in batches of a few months in the future. The applicability of the algorithms to the processing of the data of the other two Swarm satellites needs to be investigated in the future, though <b>preliminary</b> <b>checks</b> indicate that we will face additional challenges.|$|E

A comparison of the relative collisional and radiative contributions to the equilibrium of the ground electronic state shows that this state is collisionally controlled and that the line source function for vibration-rotation transitions within this state is equivalent to the Planck function. Examination of the equilibrium for excited electronic states demonstrates that the exchange between these states and the ground electronic state is most probably determined by radiative excitation. This result implies that scattering rather than pure absorption is the appropriate mechanism for the formation of lines belonging to these electronic transitions.

The INGV seismic network covers {{a large part of}} the italian region and it is complemented by several regional permanent network handled by other institutions. CSI results from the combination of INGV seismic bulletin with bulletins produced by other institutions. To update CSI from previous release to version 2. 0 we collected seismic bulletins sent to INGV from, at present, 12 institutions managing permanent seismic networks during 2003 - 2007. Procedures to convert different file formats to PHS format as input files of Hypoellipse program have been setup that also perform <b>preliminary</b> <b>checks</b> on possible errors. To correctly merge different seismic bulletins it is mandatory to have a strict control on phase associations. To do this, additional procedures to identify earthquakes external to the interest area and wrong associations of different earthquakes based on geographic control network associations and stations' residuals after event location have been produced. About 35, 000 eartquakes, a mean value of ~ 6600 earthquakes per year, with more than 600. 000 P-phase arrivals and more then 250, 000 S-phase arrivals have been collected and located with Hypoellipse. To enhance final locations quality we applied a multiple location approach and then selected the best among several calculated hypocentres for each event. Location criteria are based on the use of two different weighting schemes for stations' distance combined with several reference regional 1 D velocity models. Native Ml Magnitudes from 2003 to 2007 are retrieved and then associated to the corresponding event from INGV bulletin. When native Ml is not available, Ml based on regression law by Castello et al. 2007, is attributed. The update of CSI catalog, also due to the strong improvement of the INGV seismic network between 2005 and present, offers a more complete image of the Italian seismicity and a new important reference for further studies on the evolution of this region and earthquake occurrence...|$|E
