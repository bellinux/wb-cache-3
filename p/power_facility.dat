5|$|Commercial {{concentrated}} {{solar power}} plants were first developed in the 1980s. The 392 MW Ivanpah Solar <b>Power</b> <b>Facility,</b> in the Mojave Desert of California, is the largest solar power plant in the world. Other large {{concentrated solar power}} plants include the 150 MW Solnova Solar Power Station and the 100 MW Andasol solar power station, both in Spain. The 250 MW Agua Caliente Solar Project, in the United States, and the 221 MW Charanka Solar Park in India, are the world's largest photovoltaic plants. Solar projects exceeding 1 GW are being developed, {{but most of the}} deployed photovoltaics are in small rooftop arrays of less than 5kW, which are connected to the grid using net metering and/or a feed-in tariff.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{thermal power}} {{stations}} include the 354megawatt (MW) Solar Energy Generating Systems {{power plant in}} the USA, Solnova Solar Power Station (Spain, 150MW), Andasol solar power station (Spain, 100MW), Nevada Solar One (USA, 64MW), PS20 solar power tower (Spain, 20MW), and the PS10 solar power tower (Spain, 11MW). The 370 MW Ivanpah Solar <b>Power</b> <b>Facility,</b> located in California's Mojave Desert, is the world's largest solar-thermal power plant project currently under construction. Many other plants are under construction or planned, mainly in Spain and the USA. In developing countries, three World Bank projects for integrated solar thermal/combined-cycle gas-turbine power plants in Egypt, Mexico, and Morocco have been approved.|$|E
5|$|Some {{solar power}} plants with power tower designs in the Mojave Desert have come under {{scrutiny}} for bird mortality. In general, these facilities are fenced off to help keep terrestrial wildlife out. However, {{in the case of}} concentrated {{solar power plants}} such as the Ivanpah Solar <b>Power</b> <b>Facility,</b> studies have concluded that a significant number of birds and bats are injured or killed either by colliding into the heliostat mirrors or from burning in solar flux created by the mirror field. Also, roadrunners become trapped outside the installed perimeter fences, where they become easy prey for coyotes, who have killed and eaten dozens of them since the facilities have been constructed.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{solar power plants}} in the Mojave Desert which supply power to the {{electricity}} grid. Insolation (solar radiation) in the Mojave Desert is among the best available in the United States, and some significant population centers {{are located in the}} area. These plants can generally be built in a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, readily available materials. Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) is the name given to nine solar power plants in the Mojave Desert which were built in the 1980s, the first commercial solar plant. These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) which made them the largest solar power installation in the world, until Ivanpah Solar <b>Power</b> <b>Facility</b> was finished in 2014.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the US Congress {{directed}} the Department of Energy {{to report on}} ways to reduce water consumption by CSP. The subsequent report noted that dry cooling technology was available that, although more expensive to build and operate, could reduce water consumption by CSP by 91 to 95 percent, bringing their consumption below that of conventional power plants. A hybrid wet/dry cooling system could reduce water consumption by 32 to 58 percent. A 2015 report by NREL noted that of the 24 operating CSP power plants in the US, 17 used wet-cooling systems. The four existing CSP plants with dry-cooled systems were the three power plants at the Ivanpah Solar <b>Power</b> <b>Facility</b> near Barstow, California, and the Genesis Solar Energy Project in Riverside County, California. Of 15 CSP projects under construction or development in the US as of March 2015, 6 planned to use wet systems (including one wet system using reclaimed wastewater), 7 planned for dry systems, 1 hybrid, and 1 unspecified.|$|E
