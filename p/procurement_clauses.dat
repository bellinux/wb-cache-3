Responsible for ahuge part of the human pressure on natural resources, and having a largeshare in the public funding, the built environment sector provides animportant venue for the use of sustainable public procurement as a tool toenhance the sustainability of societies. Selecting the best sustainable offer is a challenging task requiringenvironmental and social assessments that can only be based on complexlife cycle thinking analysis. Through the development of the “ExhaustiveSustainable public <b>procurement</b> <b>clauses</b> Manual”, this paper analyses publicprocurement issues and their potential solutions, with a focus on theenvironmental performance in buildings procurement...|$|E

In this article, the case of school cleaners employed under New South Wales government contracts between 2010 and 2011 is the vehicle for exploring {{the effectiveness of these}} protective clauses. We find that the inclusion of these protective <b>clauses</b> in <b>procurement</b> contracts is unnecessary in the Australian context, and any expectations that government contracting agencies will monitor and enforce labour standards are misleading.

We focus on so-called “top-of-the-market pricing” (TOMP) in cattle <b>procurement.</b> The TOMP <b>clause</b> is shown to have anticompetitive consequences when the same buyers who purchase contract cattle with the TOMP clause also compete to procure cattle in the subsequent spot market. The TOMP clause reduces packers' incentives to compete aggressively in the spot market. Although TOMP pricing is not in producers' collective interest, rational sellers may nonetheless sign these contracts {{with little or no}} financial inducement.
