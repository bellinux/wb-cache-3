In {{order to}} improve time-grating sensor’s {{measurement}} accuracy, which is influenced by stability of the components, temperature and mechanical processing in precision measuring procedure. A novel compensation method based on Fourier series approach and least square is presented. With this method, the measurement error is separate {{into a lot of}} harmonics, and the optimal <b>parameters</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> are evaluated by least square method. The accuracy analysis certificates that time-grating sensor’s measurement error is reduced from ± 14. 8 ″ to ± 2. 5 ″ by applying the error compensation method, which is compensated about 80 % compared with no compensation. Sensor’s accuracy is effectively improved. ...|$|E

The {{data were collected from}} the payroll records of a British Columbia copper mine. The advantage of these data is the close link between observed wages and worker productivity.

The model implies a censored wage distribution, the <b>parameters</b> <b>of</b> which can be estimated using well-known econometric techniques. Semi-parametric estimation allows for the relaxation of the distributional assumptions of the model.

Through dynamic <b>compensation</b> <b>of</b> pixel {{values of}} the LSB (Least Significant Bit) {{embedded}} image, this paper presents a novel LSB information hiding method against pixels Sample Pairs Steganalysis (SPA), a powerful steganalysis method proposed by Dumitrescu et al. with high precision.

Even when the embedding ratio is near 100 %, such dynamic compensation can lead SPA steganalysis to an incorrect judgment review because of getting a very small estimate value close to 0.

40|$|The CLIC Test Facility (CTF) is a {{prototype}} two-beam accelerator, {{in which a}} high-current "drive beam" is used to generate the RF power for the main-beam accelerator. The drive-beam accelerator consists of two S-band structures which accelerate a bunch train with a total charge of 500 nC. The substantial beam loading is compensated by operating the two accelerating structures at 7. 81 MHz {{above and below the}} bunch repetition frequency, respectively. This introduces a change of RF phase from bunch to bunch, which leads, together with off-crest injection into the accelerator, to an approximate <b>compensation</b> <b>of</b> the beam loading.

40|$|Multicriteria {{decision}} support methods {{are common in}} engineering design. These methods typically rely on a summation of weighted attributes to accomplish trade-offs among competing objectives. It {{has long been known}} that a weighted sum, when used for multicriteria optimization, may fail to locate all points on a nonconvex Pareto frontier. More recent results from the optimization literature relate the curvature of an objective function to its ability to capture Pareto points, but do not consider the significance of the objective function parameters in choosing one Pareto point over another. A parametrized family of aggregations appropriate for engineering design is shown to model decisions capturing all possible trade-offs, and therefore can direct the solution to any Pareto optimum. This paper gives a mathematical and theoretical interpretation <b>of</b> the <b>parameters</b> <b>of</b> this family of aggregations as defining a degree <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> among criteria as well as a measure of their relative importance. The inability to reach all Pareto optima is shown to be surmounted by this consideration <b>of</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> as an additional <b>parameter</b> <b>of</b> the decision. Additionally, the direct specification of importance weights is common to many decision methods. The choice of a single point from a Pareto frontier by specifying importance weights alone is shown to depend on the degree <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> implicit in the aggregation. Thus both the degree <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> and weights must be considered to capture all potentially acceptable decisions.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} the Gauss-Newton method {{as a unified}} {{approach}} to estimating noise <b>parameters</b> <b>of</b> the preva-lent non-linear compensation models, such as vector Taylor series (VTS), data-driven parallel model combination (DPMC), and unscented transform (UT), for noise-robust speech recognition. While iterative estimation of noise means in a generalized EM framework has been widely known, we demonstrate that such ap-proaches are variants of the Gauss-Newton method. Furthermore, we propose a novel noise variance estimation algorithm {{that is consistent with}} the Gauss-Newton principle. The formulation of the Gauss-Newton method reduces the noise estimation problem to determining the Jacobians of the corrupted speech parameters. For sampling-based compensations, we present two methods, sample Jacobian average (SJA) and cross-covariance (XCOV), to evaluate these Jacobians. The proposed noise estimation algorithm is evaluated for various compensation models on two tasks. The first is to fit a GMM model to artificially corrupted samples, and the second is to perform speech recognition on the Aurora 2 database. The significant performance improvements confirm the efficacy of the Gauss-Newton method to estimating the noise <b>parameters</b> <b>of</b> the non-linear <b>compensation</b> models.
