50|$|The osprey {{was one of}} {{the many}} species {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in his 18th-century work, Systema Naturae, and named as Falco haliaeetus. The genus, Pandion, is the sole member of the family <b>Pandionidae,</b> and contains only one species, the osprey (P. haliaetus). The genus Pandion was described by the French zoologist Marie Jules César Savigny in 1809.|$|E
50|$|To date {{there have}} been two extinct species named from the fossil record. Pandion homalopteron was named by Stuart L. Warter in 1976 from fossils of Middle Miocene, Barstovian age, found in marine {{deposits}} {{in the southern part of}} California. The second named species Pandion lovensis, was described in 1985 by Jonathan J. Becker from fossils found in Florida and dating to the latest Clarendonian and possibly representing a separate lineage from that of P. homalopteron and P. haliaetus. A number of claw fossils have been recovered from Pliocene and Pleistocene sediments in Florida and South Carolina. The oldest recognized <b>Pandionidae</b> family fossils have been recovered from the Oligocene age Jebel Qatrani Formation, of Faiyum, Egypt. However they are not complete enough to assign to a specific genus. Another <b>Pandionidae</b> claw fossil was recovered from Early Oligocene deposits in the Mainz basin, Germany, and was described in 2006 by Gerald Mayr.|$|E

50|$|As {{its other}} common names suggest, the osprey's diet {{consists}} almost exclusively of fish. It possesses specialised physical characteristics and exhibits unique behaviour {{to assist in}} hunting and catching prey. As {{a result of these}} unique characteristics, it has been given its own taxonomic genus, Pandion and family, <b>Pandionidae.</b> Four subspecies are usually recognized, one of which has recently been given full species status (see below). Despite its propensity to nest near water, the osprey is not classed as a sea eagle.|$|E
50|$|Many {{well-known}} birds, such as hawks, eagles, kites, harriers and Old World vultures {{are included}} in this group. The osprey is usually placed in a separate family (<b>Pandionidae),</b> as is the secretary bird (Sagittariidae), and the New World vultures are also usually now regarded as a separate family or order. Karyotype data indicate the accipitrids analysed are indeed a distinct monophyletic group, but whether this group {{should be considered a}} family or one or several order(s) on their own is a question still to be resolved.|$|E
50|$|The Accipitridae, one of {{the four}} {{families}} within the order Accipitriformes (the others being Cathartidae, <b>Pandionidae</b> and Sagittariidae), are a family of small to large birds with strongly hooked bills and variable morphology based on diet. They feed on a range of prey items from insects to medium-sized mammals, with a number feeding on carrion and a few feeding on fruit. The Accipitridae have a cosmopolitan distribution, being found on all the world's continents (except Antarctica) and a number of oceanic island groups. Some species are migratory.|$|E
50|$|The osprey differs {{in several}} respects from other diurnal birds of prey. Its toes are of equal length, its tarsi are reticulate, and its talons are rounded, rather than grooved. The osprey and owls {{are the only}} raptors whose outer toe is reversible, {{allowing}} them to grasp their prey with two toes in front and two behind. This is particularly helpful when they grab slippery fish. It has always presented something of a riddle to taxonomists, but here it is treated as the sole living {{member of the family}} <b>Pandionidae,</b> and the family listed in its traditional place as part of the order Falconiformes. Other schemes place it alongside the hawks and eagles in the family Accipitridae—which itself can be regarded as making up the bulk of the order Accipitriformes or else be lumped with the Falconidae into Falconiformes. The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy has placed it together with the other diurnal raptors in a greatly enlarged Ciconiiformes, but this results in an unnatural paraphyletic classification.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the common}} name {{suggests}} the grey-headed fish eagle is a specialist piscivore, which preys upon live fish and scavenges dead fish and occasionally reptiles and terrestrial birds and small mammals. Tingay et al. {{found that the}} diet of the grey-headed fish eagle in the Prek Toal protected area of the Tonlé Sap contains the endangered Tonlé Sap water snake. Whether this is the primary prey item of their diet or a seasonal occurrence in this are remains unclear.The most common method of foraging used is to catch fish from a hunting perch close to a water source with a short flight to snatch prey on the water surface or just below. [...] Also quarters over stretches of river or lakes and fish too heavy to lift may be dragged to bank to devour. It is also dynamic in prey pursuit and can catch fish in rough water such as rapids. Both species in the genus Ichthyophaga have strongly recurved talons like the osprey (<b>Pandionidae)</b> a specialisation for catching fish, which is lacking in the genus Haliaeetus (sea eagles).|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, the major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) has received much attention {{in the fields of}} evolutionary and conservation biology because of its potential implications in many biological processes. New insights into the gene structure and evolution of MHC genes can be gained through study of additional lineages of birds not yet investigated at the genomic level. In this study, we characterized MHC class II B genes in five families of birds of prey (Accipitridae, <b>Pandionidae,</b> Strigidae, Tytonidae, and Falconidae). Using PCR approaches, we isolated genomic MHC sequences up to 1300 bp spanning exons 1 to 3 in 26 representatives of each raptor lineage, finding no stop codons or frameshift mutations in any coding region. A survey of diversity across the entirety of exon 2 in the lesser kestrel Falco naumanni reported 26 alleles in 21 individuals. Bayesian analysis revealed 21 positively selected amino acid sites, which suggests that the MHC genes described here are functional and probably expressed. Finally, through interlocus comparisons and phylogenetic analysis, we also discuss genetic evidence for concerted and transspecies evolution in the raptor MHC. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In Bangladesh, are were a {{total of}} {{seventeen}} types of raptors including species and sub species. These raptors only belongs to one order of Falconiformes and three different families- Falconidae (5), Accipitridae (11) and <b>Pandionidae</b> (1). Among these numbers, they are divided into eight categories, namely, merlin, kestrel, hobby, falconet, baza, vulture, kite and eagle. There are some differences among these birds. The merlin catches their prey {{in the time of}} dawn or twilight and its tail narrow during flight. Pointed wing were found in kestrel and broad tail. In case of hobby, their body was almost streamlined and wing is scythe-shaped. Falconets are small in size than the falcon and it differs from falcon; only their swallow-shrike like flying.

In the present study, a third specimen of M. parvunguis is described that provides critical new details of the osteology of this species.

The affinities of M. parvunguis to other “falconiform ” birds are uncertain, and the species is classified in the new taxon Masillaraptoridae.

40|$|Despite the {{ubiquity of}} raptors in {{terrestrial}} ecosystems, many aspects of their predatory behaviour remain poorly understood. Surprisingly {{little is known about}} the morphology of raptor talons and how they are employed during feeding behaviour. Talon size variation among digits can be used to distinguish families of raptors and is related to different techniques of prey restraint and immobilisation. The hypertrophied talons on digits (D) I and II in Accipitridae have evolved primarily to restrain large struggling prey while they are immobilised by dismemberment. Falconidae have only modest talons on each digit and only slightly enlarged D-I and II. For immobilisation, Falconini rely more strongly on strike impact and breaking the necks of their prey, having evolved a ‘tooth ’ on the beak to aid in doing so. <b>Pandionidae</b> have enlarged, highly recurved talons on each digit, an adaptation for piscivory, convergently seen to a lesser extent in fishing eagles. Strigiformes bear enlarged talons with comparatively low curvature on each digit, part of a suite of adaptations to increase constriction efficiency by maximising grip strength, indicative of specialisation on small prey. Restraint and immobilisation strategy change as prey increase in size. Small prey are restrained by containment within the foot and immobilised by constriction and beak attacks. Large prey are restrained by pinning under the bodyweight of the raptor, maintaining grip with the talons, and immobilised by dismemberment (Accipitridae), or severing the spinal cord (Falconini). Within all raptors, physical attributes of the feet trade off against each other to attain great strength, but it is the variable means by which thi...|$|E
40|$|In birds, the noncoding {{control region}} (CR) and its {{flanking}} genes {{are the only}} parts of the mitochondrial (mt) genome that have been modified by intragenomic rearrangements. In raptors, two noncoding regions are present: the CR has shifted to a new position {{with respect to the}} ‘‘ancestral avian gene order,’’ whereas the pseudo-control region (CCR) is located at the original genomic position of the CR. As possible mechanisms for this rearrangement, duplication and transposition have been considered. During characterization of the mt gene order in Bonelli’s eagle Hieraaetus fasciatus, we detected intragenomic sequence similarity between the two regions supporting the duplication hypothesis. We performed intra- and intergenomic sequence comparisons in H. fasciatus and other falconiform species to trace the evolution of the noncoding mtDNA regions in Falconiformes. We identified sections displaying different levels of similarity between the CR and CCR. On the basis of phylogenetic analyses, we outline an evolutionary scenario of the underlying mutation events involving duplication and homogenization processes followed by sporadic deletions. Apparently, homogenization may easily occur if sufficient sequence similarity between the CR and CCR exists. Moreover, homogenization itself allows perpetuation of this continued equalization, unless this process is stopped by deletion. The <b>Pandionidae</b> and the Aquilinae seem to be the only two lineages of Falconiformes where homology between both regions is still detectable, whereas in other raptors no similarity was found so far. In these two lineages, the process of sequence degeneration may have slowed down by homogenization events retaining high sequence similarity at least in some sections. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} a rapid antigen-capture assay (VecTest) for {{detection of}} West Nile virus in oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs, collected at necropsy from owls (N = 93) and raptors (N = 27). Sensitivity was 93. 5 %– 95. 2 % for northern owl species but < 42. 9 % {{for all other}} species. Specificity was 100 % for owls and 85. 7 % for raptors. The emergence of West Nile virus (WNV) in North America has created a demand for reliable, rapid, and economical tests for detecting this flavivirus (family Flaviviridae) {{in a variety of}} species and sample types. The VecTest (Medical Analysis Systems, Camarillo, CA), a rapid antigen-capture wicking assay, was previously reported to detect WNV in mosquitoes (1, 2) and corvid birds (family Corvidae) (3). Little is known about the ability of this test to detect WNV in avian species other than corvids. Low sensitivity of the test when applied to oropharyngeal swabs from dead raptors has been recently reported (3). Since the test is largely dependent on the concentration of viral antigen in the analyzed sample (2, 3), the test is more likely to detect WNV in swabs collected from birds that shed large quantities of the virus. Timing of the sample collection with relation to the course of the infection (i. e., acute versus subacute or chronic) is also expected to play a key role, as virus shedding generally is short-lived (4). The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the usefulness of the VecTest for detecting WNV in oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs from North American owls (family Strigidae) and raptors (families Falconidae, Accipitridae, <b>Pandionidae).</b> Based on an observed higher susceptibility of northern versus southern owl species to WNV (5), we hypothesized that patterns of virus excretion that influence the sensitivity of this test might differ. Owl species were classified as northern if most of their natural breedin...|$|E
40|$|Previous cross-species {{painting}} {{studies with}} probes from chicken (Gallus gallus) chromosomes 1 - 10 and a paint pool of nineteen microchromosomes {{have revealed that}} the drastic karyotypic reorganization in Accipitridae is due to extensive synteny disruptions and associations. However, the number of synteny association events and identities of microchromosomes involved in such synteny associations remain undefined, {{due to the lack}} of paint probes derived from individual chicken microchromosomes. Moreover, no genome-wide homology map between Accipitridae species and other avian species with atypical karyotype organization has been reported till now, and the karyotype evolution within Accipitriformes remains unclear. [br/] To delineate the synteny-conserved segments in Accipitridae, a set of painting probes for the griffon vulture, Gyps fulvus (2 n = 66) was generated from flow-sorted chromosomes. Together with previous generated probes from the stone curlew, Burhinus oedicnemus (2 n = 42), a Charadriiformes species with atypical karyotype organization, we conducted multidirectional chromosome painting, including reciprocal chromosome painting between B. oedicnemus and G. fulvus and cross-species chromosome painting between B. oedicnemus and two accipitrid species (the Himalayan griffon, G. himalayensis 2 n = 66, and the common buzzard, Buteo buteo, 2 n = 68). In doing so, genome-wide homology maps between B. oedicnemus and three Accipitridae species were established. From there, a cladistic analysis using chromosomal characters and mapping of chromosomal changes on a consensus molecular phylogeny were conducted in order to search for cytogenetic signatures for different lineages within Accipitriformes. [br/] Our study confirmed that the genomes of the diurnal birds of prey, especially the genomes of species in Accipitriformes excluding Cathartidae, have been extensively reshuffled when compared to other bird lineages. The chromosomal rearrangements involved include both fusions and fissions. Our chromosome painting data indicated that the Palearctic common buzzard (BBU) shared several common chromosomal rearrangements with some Old World vultures, and was found to be more closely related to other Accipitridae than to Neotropical buteonine raptors from the karyotypic perspective. Using both a chromosome-based cladistic analysis as well as by mapping of chromosomal differences onto a molecular-based phylogenetic tree, we revealed a number of potential cytogenetic signatures that support the clade of <b>Pandionidae</b> (PHA) + Accipitridae. In addition, our cladistic analysis using chromosomal characters appears to support the placement of osprey (PHA) in Accipitridae...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on survival estimates for different species of raptors and owls, examines the methods used to obtain the estimates, and draws out some general patterns arising. Estimating survival usually involves the marking of birds {{so that they can}} be recognized as individuals on subsequent encounters. Annual survival can then be estimated from: (1) birds ringed at known age (usually as nestlings) and subsequently reported by members of the public (usually as found dead), the ratio of recoveries at different ages being used to calculate annual survival; (2) marked breeding adults, trapped or re-sighted in subsequent years in particular study areas, with the proportion re-trapped (or re-sighted) in each year being taken as the minimum annual survival; (3) live encounter (trapped or re-sighted) of birds marked either as nestlings or breeding adults analysed using the capture–mark–recapture (or re-sighting) methods to estimate annual survival; (4) a combination of reports of known-age dead birds and re-trapping/re-sighting of live birds; (5) use of radio- or satellite-tracking to follow the fates of individuals; and (6) the integration of these methods with other information, such as change in numbers between years, to derive estimates of survival and other demographic parameters. Studies confined to particular areas usually give estimates of ‘apparent annual survival’, because they take no account of birds that leave the area. However, radio- or satellite-tracking makes it possible to estimate true survival, including survival of prebreeders that have low natal-site fidelity (this usually requires satellite telemetry). As in other birds, the preferred method for estimating survival has changed over time, as new and more robust methods of estimation have been developed. Methods 1 and 2 were the first to be developed, but without statistical underpinning, while methods 3 – 6 were developed later on the basis of formal statistical models. This difference has to be borne in mind in comparing older with newer estimates for particular species. Published survival estimates were found for three species of Cathartidae, one of <b>Pandionidae,</b> 29 of Accipitridae, 12 of Falconidae, one of Tytonidae and nine of Strigidae, almost all from temperate Northern Hemisphere species. In most of these species more than one estimate was available, and in some separate estimates for different age or sex groups. The main patterns to emerge included: (1) a significant tendency for annual adult survival to increase with body weight, smaller species having annual survival rates mainly of 60 – 70 %, medium-sized species having rates mainly in the range 70 – 90 % and the largest having rates of > 90 %, in the absence of obvious human-caused losses; (2) a lower survival in the first or prebreeding years of life than in subsequent years; (3) a lack of obvious or consistent differences in survival between the sexes, where these could be distinguished; and (4) in the few species for which enough data were available, a decline in annual survival rates in the later years of life...|$|E
