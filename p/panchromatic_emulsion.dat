5000|$|Miethe Glacier (...) is {{a glacier}} 3 nmi km long, flowing {{northwest}} into Gerlache Strait {{to the south}} of Mount Banck, on the west coast of Graham Land, Antarctica. The glacier appears on an Argentine government chart of 1952. It was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1960 for Adolf Miethe, a German chemist who introduced the first <b>panchromatic</b> <b>emulsion</b> for photographic plates in 1903.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his first}} patent application, filed February 11, 1913, American {{inventor}} Percy Douglas Brewster described a new color film process: The exposure is made through a ray filter, preferably light yellow {{in color and}} adapted to cut off all the violet and ultra-violet rays of light. The green and blue light {{with the addition of}} some yellow, after passing through the ray filter, acts upon the <b>panchromatic</b> <b>emulsion</b> {{on the front of the}} film, while the red and orange light with some yellow passes through the film and acts upon the <b>panchromatic</b> <b>emulsion</b> on the back of the film. The color that the transparent emulsion is stained prevents the passage of a substantial amount of blue and green light through the film to act upon the panchromatic film on the back. Over the next eight years, Brewster filed a series of further patents pertaining to photographic film, film development, color cinematography, and various improvements to the process. [...] In 1917, a patent for a method of [...] "Coloring or Dyeing Photographic Images" [...] was issued to Hoyt Miller, chief chemist of the Brewster Color Film Corporation, and assigned to the corporation.|$|E
50|$|In <b>panchromatic</b> <b>emulsions,</b> the {{sensitivity}} of the silver halide crystal is enhanced by sensitizing dyes that adsorb on the crystal surface. Therefore, sensitivity can be increased by absorbing more sensitizing dye. This requires increasing the surface area of the crystal, and also improving the dye molecules to form a dense assembly. Tabular grain emulsion solves {{the first part of this}} problem.|$|R
50|$|However, all {{of these}} were glass-based plate products. <b>Panchromatic</b> <b>emulsions</b> on a film base were not commercially {{available}} until the 1910s and did not come into general use until much later. Many photographers who did their own darkroom work preferred to go without the seeming luxury of sensitivity to red—a rare color in nature and uncommon even in man-made objects—rather than be forced to abandon the traditional red darkroom safelight and process their exposed film in complete darkness. Kodak's popular Verichrome black-and-white snapshot film, introduced in 1931, remained a red-insensitive orthochromatic product until 1956, when it was replaced by Verichrome Pan. Amateur darkroom enthusiasts then had to handle the undeveloped film by the sense of touch alone.|$|R
50|$|In 1894, the Lumière Brothers {{introduced}} their Lumière Panchromatic plate, {{which was}} made sensitive, although very unequally, to all colors including red. New and improved sensitizing dyes were developed, and in 1902 the much more evenly color-sensitive Perchromo panchromatic plate was being sold by the German manufacturer Perutz. The commercial availability of highly <b>panchromatic</b> black-and-white <b>emulsions</b> also accelerated the progress of practical color photography, which requires good sensitivity to all {{the colors of the}} spectrum for the red, green and blue channels of color information to all be captured with reasonable exposure times.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{practical and}} commercially successful color photography reversal process was the Lumière Autochrome, introduced in 1907. This was an additive method, using a <b>panchromatic</b> <b>emulsion</b> coated on a thin glass plate previously {{coated with a}} layer of dyed potato starch grains. Autochrome plates were discontinued in the 1930s, after the introduction of Lumière Filmcolor in sheet film and Lumicolor in roll film sizes. Also using the additive principle and reversal processing were the Agfa color screen plates and films and Dufaycolor film, all of which were discontinued by 1961.|$|E
5000|$|The Technicolor Process 4 camera, {{manufactured}} to Technicolor's {{detailed specifications}} by Mitchell Camera Corporation, contained color filters, {{a beam splitter}} consisting of a partially reflecting surface inside a split-cube prism, and three separate rolls of black-and-white film (hence the [...] "three-strip" [...] designation). The beam splitter allowed ⅓ of the light coming through the camera lens {{to pass through the}} reflector and a green filter and form an image on one of the strips, which therefore recorded only the green-dominated third of the spectrum. The other ⅔ was reflected sideways by the mirror and passed through a magenta filter, which absorbed green light and allowed only the red and blue thirds of the spectrum to pass. Behind this filter were the other two strips of film, their emulsions pressed into contact face to face. The front film was a red-blind orthochromatic type that recorded only the blue light. On the surface of its emulsion was a red-orange coating that prevented blue light from continuing on to the red-sensitive <b>panchromatic</b> <b>emulsion</b> of the film behind it, which therefore recorded only the red-dominated third of the spectrum.|$|E
5000|$|The first Kodak {{product called}} Kodachrome {{was invented by}} John Capstaff in 1913. His Kodachrome was a {{subtractive}} process that used only two colors: blue-green and red-orange. It required two glass plate negatives, one made using a <b>panchromatic</b> <b>emulsion</b> and a red filter, the other made using an emulsion insensitive to red light. The two plates could be exposed as a [...] "bipack" [...] (sandwiched emulsion to emulsion, with a very thin red filter layer between), which eliminated the need for multiple exposures or a special color camera. After development, the silver images were bleached out with chemistry that hardened the bleached portions of the gelatin. Using dyes which were absorbed only by the unhardened gelatin, the negative that recorded the blue and green light was dyed red-orange and the red-exposed negative was dyed blue-green. The result {{was a pair of}} positive dye images. The plates were then assembled emulsion to emulsion, producing a transparency that was capable of surprisingly good (for a two-color process) color rendition of skin tones in portraits. Capstaff's Kodachrome was made commercially available in 1915. It was also adapted for use as a 35 mm motion picture film process.Today, this first version of Kodachrome is nearly forgotten, completely overshadowed by the next Kodak product bearing the name Kodachrome.|$|E
5000|$|Autochrome is an {{additive}} color [...] "mosaic screen plate" [...] process. The medium {{consists of a}} glass plate coated on one side with a random mosaic of microscopic grains of potato starch dyed red-orange, green, and blue-violet (an unusual but functional variant of the standard red, green, and blue {{additive color}}s) which act as color filters. Lampblack fills the spaces between grains, and a black-and-white <b>panchromatic</b> silver halide <b>emulsion</b> is coated {{on top of the}} filter layer.|$|R
2500|$|Coincidentally at {{this same}} time a new <b>panchromatic</b> {{photographic}} <b>emulsion</b> was developed that allowed {{the full range of}} colors to be captured. Soon after it became available Stieglitz aimed his 8" [...] x 10" [...] view camera at the sky and began taking pictures. By the next year he had created a series of ten mounted photographs he called Music: A Sequence of Ten Cloud Photographs (also called Clouds in Ten Movements). He told his wife Georgia O'Keeffe [...] "I wanted a series that when seen by Ernest Bloch (the great composer) he would exclaim: Music! Music! Man, why that is music! How did you ever do that? And he would point to violins and flutes, and oboes, and brass…" [...] He first exhibited this series in 1923 in his one-man show at the Anderson Galleries in New York, and reported that when Bloch saw them there he had exactly the reaction Stieglitz had wanted.|$|R
3000|$|The next {{paper of}} the 3 D displays' group is {{entitled}} [...] "Basic holographic {{characteristics of a}} panchromatic light sensitive material for reflective auto stereoscopic 3 D display" [...] by Ts. Petrova et al. The aim of this work is to present recently obtained results {{on the development of}} ultra-fine grain <b>panchromatic</b> silver halide <b>emulsion</b> for high-quality recording of RGB reflection holograms for the needs of auto stereoscopic video display. The average grain size in the emulsion is less than 10 [*]nm, which ensures a high resolution, a high diffraction efficiency, and a high signal-to-noise ratio in a large dynamic range for RGB reflective holographic recording.|$|R
50|$|A <b>panchromatic</b> <b>emulsion</b> {{produces}} a realistic reproduction {{of a scene}} as it appears to the human eye. Almost all modern photographic film is panchromatic, but some types are orthochromatic and are not sensitive to certain wavelengths of light. As naturally prepared, silver halide emulsions are much more sensitive to blue and UV light than to green and red wavelengths. The German chemist Hermann W. Vogel found out how to extend the sensitivity into the green, and later the orange, by adding sensitising dyes to the emulsion. By the addition of erythrosine the emulsion could be made orthochromatic while some cyanine derivatives confer sensitivity to the whole visible spectrum making it panchromatic. However, his technique was not extended to achieve a fully panchromatic film until the early 1900s, shortly after his death. Panchromatic stock for still photographic plates became available commercially in 1906. The switch from orthochromatic film, however, was only gradual. Panchromatic plates cost {{two to three times}} as much, and had to be developed in darkness, unlike orthochromatic—which, being insensitive to red, could be developed under a red light in the darkroom. And the process that increased the film's sensitivity to yellow and red also made it oversensitive to blue and violet, requiring a yellow-red lens filter to correct it, which in turn reduced the total amount of light and increased the necessary exposure time.|$|E
40|$|Kodak Technical Pan (Tech-Pan) {{film is a}} {{standard}} <b>panchromatic</b> <b>emulsion</b> that was used at the UK 1. 2 -m Schmidt Telescope (UKST) {{for a variety of}} broad-band exposures between 1992 and 2003. However, despite its versatility and frequent use, no formal presentation of its colour-term stability has been provided. A sample of 32 short-exposure Tech-Pan films was specifically acquired in five wavebands with a view to establishing the photometric relationships between Tech-Pan and the equivalent glass-based emulsions previously used. These films have been measured using the SuperCOSMOS measuring machine and the data reduced to provide the appropriate quantitative information. New colour terms relating these measurements to the Cousins photoelectric system are presented. They are shown to be stable, reproducible, generally small and similar to colour terms previously derived for the older emulsions on glass that Tech-Pan effectively replaced. These results give confidence in the use of Tech-Pan photometry from on-line UKST legacy survey archives. © 2005 RAS. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|In this project, an {{exposure}} meter which is sensitive to, and calibrated for infrared radiation {{was designed and}} constructed. An EG 2 ̆ 6 G SGD- 100 A silicon photodiode was chosen to use as the photodetector. This choice was based on cost, availability, ruggedness, stability, and sensitivity. A circuit using an operational amplifier to amplify {{the output of the}} photodetector was used. The circuit design allowed easy variation of the signal gain to give a detectable meter deflection under varying lighting conditions. Five different gains were used to allow use of the meter under conditions ranging from outside under direct sunlight, to inside with typical room lighting. The gains used were empirically established. The film used was Kodak HIE 135 - 20. This is a black-and-white <b>panchromatic</b> <b>emulsion</b> with special sensitizing agents added to extend the film 2 ̆ 7 s sensitivity into the near infrared to about 900 nanometers. The spectral response of the photodetector was to be filtered to match the spectral response of this infrared sensitized film. This proved not to be possible, due to the unavailability of any regular, stock filter which cuts off wavelengths above 900 nanometers. Despite this problem, the meter is much more accurate for setting exposures for the infrared sensitized film used than a normal {{exposure meter}}. The designed meter typically indicates within one stop of the optimum exposure for this film. A normal exposure meter reading made using Kodak 2 ̆ 7 s exposure recommendations was incorrect by as much as three stops...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA review. Cyanine derivs., named {{from the}} Greek word kyanos meaning dark-blue, were {{discovered}} 150 {{years ago and}} remain {{one of the most}} widely used classes of org. dyes with contemporary applications in photog. (<b>panchromatic</b> <b>emulsions),</b> information storage (CD-R and DVD-R media) and biochem. (DNA and protein labeling) fields. Cyanine chromogens consist of a charged π-conjugated segment contg. an odd no. of sp 2 carbon atoms with the chain capped at the extremities by two electroneg. centers, typically nitrogen or oxygen atoms. Cyanines were characterized by a vanishing bond length alternation indicating nearly equal carbon-carbon bond lengths, as well as a very intense and sharp absorption band presenting a shoulder. This hallmark band undergoes a strong red shift when the chain is extended. This so-called vinyl shift is extremely large (∼ 100 nm for each pair of carbon atoms added in the π-conjugated path), making cyanines ideal building blocks for the design of devices with near-IR applications. Numerous cyanines also exhibit emission bands with large quantum yields. These exceptional optical properties explain why both canonical cyanines and the corresponding fluoroborates (e. g., boron-dipyrromethene, BODIPY) remain the focus of an ever-growing body of exptl. work. In turn, this popularity has stimulated quantum mech. studies aiming, on the one hand, at probing the specific electronic nature of cyanine dyes and, however, at helping to design new dyes. However, the adiabatic approxn. to time-dependent d. functional theory, the most widespread ab initio model for electronically excited states, fails to accurately reproduce the absorption spectra of cyanine derivs. : it yields a systematic and large underestimation of the exptl. wavelengths irresp. of the details of the computational protocol. In contrast, highly correlated wave function approaches provide accurate transition energies for model systems but are hardly applicable to real-life cyanines and BODIPY. Setting up a computationally tractable theor. protocol that provides both robust and accurate optical spectra for cyanine-based dyes is a major challenge that has only been taken up lately. In this Account, the authors compile the most recent advances in the field by considering both compact streptocyanines and large fluoroborates. For the former, the authors summarize the key results obtained with a large panel of theor. approaches, allowing the authors not only to understand the origin of the cyanine challenge but also to pinpoint the schemes presenting the most promising accuracy/effort ratio. For the latter, the authors show via selected examples how theor. models can be used to reproduce simultaneously exptl. band shapes and transition energies, thus paving the way to an efficient in silico design of new compds...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe chief {{problem of}} this {{research}} was to study by standard sensitometric procedures the effects of intensity, time and wavelength on the amount of speed increase which might be obtained from four representative slow, regular, high, and extra high speed emulsions (Royal Pan, Aerial Recon type 1 -B Class L, Plus X and Microfile) by latensification. Latensification has been defined simply as a process applied after exposure and before development to increase the speed or sensitivity (reciprocal of the exposure required to produce a given result) of an emulsion. A secondary purpose was to examine latensification of a very slow, fine grain emulsion for possible use in small high quality aerial camera systems, in which the emulsion graininess is the limiting factor when used with conventional high speed emulsions. The latensification method in this case was post-exposure to radiation from 0. 36 to 0. 68 microns. This spectral range was divided into four bands by the Wratten Filters # 25 A, 58 and 47 B, (red, green and blue respectively) and the Corning 7 - 54, ultraviolet. White light was also used. A tungsten lamp of constant intensity, combined with a ground glass and two inch opal glass disk diffuser produced a source of uniform illumination. Normally exposed sensitometric strips were then subject to laten sification by exposure to radiation in which the spectral region, intensity, and time were varied. Each emulsion was subject to four spectral regions plus white light and four intensity levels for each region. The exposure was then extended over a range of time believed sufficient to reach a peak speed increase for that intensity. Reciprocity failure was sufficient to need considerable attention. The characteristic curves were analyzed by measuring ASA, halfgamma and inertia (H & D) speeds. The speed ratios (latensified speed/control speed) obtained for each spectral region, intensity, and time of exposure were compiled. Curves of speed ratio against time of exposure and fog level against required exposure time for each intensity and spectral region were plotted. These experiments have shown that white light may be used most efficiently in latensification with the <b>panchromatic</b> <b>emulsions</b> tested. In addition to this {{it has been shown that}} the short wavelength region is less effective in producing speed gains than is the long wavelength region. It has been explained that these effects may be due primarily to the greater scattering of the blue and ultra-violet light by the emulsion even though the Gurney-Mott theory of latent image formation would indicate otherwise if these other influences were n ot considered. The overall evaluation attests to the fact that the effect of wavelength is a secondary consideration as compared to the intensity of radiation used to latensify the emulsion. Optimum intensity, when applied with the proper length of exposure time to produce a fog lievel approximately double the normal fog, is the major factor leading to optimum conditions of speed gain. The maximum speed ratio gains achieved for each emulsion were Royal Pan 2. 24, Aerial Recon 1. 85, Plus X 2. 08, and Microfile 7. 35. Generally speaking the slower the emulsion the better the gains which may be achieved. Royal Pan, however, was an exception and produced unexpected results in speed gain. The results obtained with Microfile indicate this fine grain emulsion may possibly be employed in miniature camera systems for use in aerial photography. A less active developer than normally used D- 11 must be used to reduce contrast to a comparable degree ordinarily used in aerial photography. The effect of forced development in D- 11 was found not to produce speed gains as high as the less active development in D- 23, Development in Microdol (1 : 4) proved of little interest as speed loss was excessive. This speed loss is characteristic of most true fine-grain developers...|$|R
50|$|These {{plate and}} film {{products}} differed substantially {{only in the}} means used to manufacture the colour mosaic layer and its resulting pattern and fineness. Autochrome's mosaic was a random array of dyed potato starch grains, {{too small to be}} individually visible without a microscope. Most competing products employed a coarser geometric pattern created by one of the many methods devised and patented during that era. Dufaycolor's filter layer was of the geometric type, but its proprietary manufacturing process produced an unusually fine-patterned mosaic. A very thin coating of collodion {{on one side of the}} film base was dyed blue, printed with closely spaced fine lines using a water-repelling greasy ink, and bleached. The clear spaces created were then dyed green. The ink was removed and new ink lines were printed at a 90 degree angle to the blue and green lines. The new gaps were bleached and dyed red, resulting in a colour filter mosaic, known as a réseau, consisting of alternating green and blue squares between red lines, and having roughly one million colour filter elements per square inch.In very early years, different arrangements of the same colours were used, the lines being green or blue instead of red and sometimes intersecting the other colours diagonally. After a final ink removal and the application of an isolating varnish, the same side of the film base was coated with a <b>panchromatic</b> black-and-white photographic <b>emulsion.</b> When exposed to light through the base and its réseau, the bit of emulsion behind each colour element recorded only the amount of light of that primary colour striking the film at that point.|$|R
