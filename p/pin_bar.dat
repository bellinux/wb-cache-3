50|$|Badges {{were made}} of pressed steel, brass and zinc. All {{versions}} of the Wound Badge were worn on the lower left breast of the uniform or tunic. The badge was worn below all other awards on the left. It ranked lower than combat badges. There were 24 approved manufacturers of the Wound Badge. At first, the Wound Badge in Black was stamped from sheet brass, painted semi-matte black with a hollow reverse pin back attachment or of solid construction. From 1942, steel was {{used to make the}} badges. The Wound Badge in silver was made (before 1942) from silver-plated brass, and (after 1942) from lacquered zinc, and had a solid reverse with either a needle pin or a broad flat <b>pin</b> <b>bar.</b> The Wound Badge in Gold was a gilded version of the Wound Badge in Silver. In 1957, a revised version of the Wound Badge was authorised for wear; however, the previous type could still be worn if the swastika were removed (for example by grinding).|$|E

" Verso: Text only, "First Distinguished Service Award; In Recognition of Outstanding Servuce to Humanity. " Kept in original box of navy leather with sild padding inside. Hannah S. JanovskyAlice Salomon had been born Jewish of Jewish parents, though she converted to the Lutheran church in 1914. She earned her doctor diploma (Dr. phil.) as early as 1906 with a dissertation on unequal pay for equal jobs for men and women (‘Die Ursachen der ungleichen Entlohnung von Maenner und Frauenarbeit’). She received an honorary doctorate in medicine in 1932 on occasion of her 60 th birthday. At the time she was given by the Prussian government a silver medal for her services in social welfare, and the Wohlfahrtsschule Pestalozzi-Froebelhaus was renamed “Alice Salomon-Schule". When she returned from a trip to the United States to Germany in the spring of 1937 she was called for a lengthy interrogation by the Gestapo and was ordered to leave Germany within three weeks. She emigrated to England where she received her immigration visa to the United states (according to her passport). Her arrival in the USA was noted in the Herald Tribune and the New York Times. She received honors in the USA in 1939 and in 1942. Updated recordDigital imag...|$|E

40|$|Reciprocal {{frames and}} {{reciprocal}} structures {{have already been}} considered of great interest in the past, as witnessed {{by the work of}} Leonardo da Vinci and of other important scientists and architects. Recent researches show that both the shape and the mechanical behaviour of such structures are really complexes, due to the concept of reciprocity. The position of each structural element in the space, indeed, as well as the way they transfer loads, depends on the position and on the role of adjacent elements, so that the structure must be studied as a whole and it can hardly be decomposed in simpler substructures. In this paper we focus on the statical and mechanical determinacy of a specific subset of this kind of structures, i. e. the multiple plane reciprocal frames. In this structures the shape can be easily defined in plane coordinates, so that only the mechanical behaviour needs to be studied. The presence of mechanisms or the possibility of self-stress states is largely related to the kind of internal constraints joining each bar to the others. The study is developed starting from the basic works on <b>pinned</b> <b>bars</b> assemblies [5], [8], in which the statical and kinematical determinacy are discussed by means of a matrix formulation of the equilibrium and compatibility equations. The extension of such formulation from <b>pinned</b> <b>bars</b> assemblies to plane reciprocal frames is the main goal of the researc...|$|R

50|$|The PJAS <b>pin</b> and <b>bars</b> {{are unique}} to the organization. Students earn bar(s) for each {{competition}} (except for honorable mention) that are colored to reflect performance. Students can earn bars at each regional meet and each state meet they present a project and connect them {{together to form a}} chain or history of their performance. The bar attached to the pin is the oldest project and the newest project is at the bottom. Returning members of PJAS like to wear their <b>pins</b> and <b>bar</b> while presenting during meets.Depending on the student and his/her projects, it is possible for students to earn more than the 10 bars that could be earned if the student participated for all five years. Students earning a First Award Perfect Score earn two pins - one for their first award and a second for their perfect score. Therefore, it is theoretically possible for a student who competes in all 12 competitions to earn a maximum of 24 bars if the student earns a perfect score at every meet for all six years.|$|R

Some institutions use Old English or script style, two or three letter monogram, 3D shading, chenille bordered or the traditional straight block style.

These additional designations are shown by adding embroidered sport insignias, modeled metal insert <b>pins,</b> or <b>bars</b> that {{are attached to the}} letter.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a systematic {{study of the}} influence of certain parameters on the fire resistance of compressed steel elements with restrained thermal elongation. The parameters studied were: the slenderness of the element, the stiffness of the surrounding structure and the eccentricity of the loading. Nearly 190 tests were performed on small <b>pin</b> ended steel <b>bars</b> and 18 tests on small built in steel <b>bars.</b> For the <b>pin</b> ended <b>bars,</b> four different slenderness values (319, 199, 133 and 80), two eccentricities of the compression load (1 mm and another equal to the thickness of the bar) and six values of restraint to axial elongation (0, 1, 10, 24, 42 and 98 kN/mm) were tested. For the built in bars, two slenderness values (80 and 32) and three values of restraint to axial elongation (1, 10 and 98 kN/mm) were tested. Tensile tests and compression tests at room temperature were conducted to find the mechanical properties of the steel bars used in the fire resistance testsAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|In this study, link {{mechanisms}} are modeled using finite elements {{based upon the}} Shifted Integration technique. A single link structure of a pin joint and a rigid bar is expressed by two linear Timoshenko beam elements with their numerical integration points shifted to {{opposite ends of the}} link joint. The finite-element approach in control schemes may provide flexibility against sudden change in a hardware system, since the remodeling can be achieved easily by rewriting input data. This paper describes an application of the modeling to normal <b>pin</b> joint-rigid <b>bar</b> link mechanisms. A numerical scheme for obtaining joint torque curves in n-link mechanisms based upon Cartesian coordinates is derived, and a numerical test on an 8 -link mechanism by the Finite Element Method is carried out.

50|$|After {{students}} {{present their}} research, the judges deliberate {{and determine the}} student's score based on the appropriate PJAS rubric. Some regions host an awards ceremony or an awards dinner. At these events, students receive a certificate and a bar with {{the color of their}} award (See <b>Pin</b> & <b>Bars).</b> Some regions gain enough funding to also support special awards (like Director's awards or ones sponsored by societies or companies) for students who score the highest in their respective category or based on other criterion. For example, Region 1A had awards at their 2016 Regional Meet for students with exceptional analysis sections, exceptional research, or outstanding projects their judges nominate. Special awards at the regional meet aren't required for PJAS and thus, depend on each region. Region 1A, for example, hosted its first year of special awards at its 2016 Regional Meet, while Region 9 has given out special awards throughout the past several years.|$|R
