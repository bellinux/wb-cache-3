5|$|After World War II, North Philadelphia {{suffered}} from the failure of its industries, and the PRR reduced both local and long-distance service due to competition from private autos, further reducing {{the importance of the}} station. Escalators and a new drop ceiling were added around 1955, the former due to the insistence of the city council. The surrounding <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> <b>and</b> ground were rearranged in 1968.|$|E

Front end loaders with large box-like front end attachment are used to clear snow in parking lots in malls and other institutions.|$|E

5|$|Historically, most rain {{falling on}} the {{watershed}} was taken up by vegetation, flowed into wetlands, soaked into the ground, or evaporated. Heavy rain in the winter months recharged the groundwater and provided baseflows to the slough during dry summers. Urban development, which replaced vegetation and water-absorbing soils with airport runways, house roofs, highways, warehouses, <b>parking</b> <b>lots,</b> <b>and</b> other hard surfaces, interrupted this cycle. In 1999, a study estimated that impervious surfaces covered 54percent of the watershed. Storm runoff that might have taken days to reach the historic slough reaches the developed slough in hours.|$|E
5|$|A 1,000-car {{above-ground}} parking garage, {{owned by}} the state, is located south of the stadium's center field entrance on Harrison Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues.

Other state-owned free <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> <b>and</b> paid private lots are located in the vicinity. The Metro Transit Authority's Music City Circuit provides bus service to and from a drop-off site at Fifth Avenue North and Harrison Street. Nashville BCycle, the city's bike-share program, has a station at First Tennessee Park.|$|E
5|$|Old Louisville's {{boundaries}} are Kentucky Street to the north, Avery Street (Cardinal Boulevard) to the south, I-65 to the east, the CSX railroad tracks to the west. Originally, the neighborhood extended {{all the way}} to Broadway on the north, Attwood Street on the south, and Floyd Street on the East; but the northern part was mostly razed for <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> <b>and</b> light industry, the southern area between Attwood and Avery Streets (now Cardinal Blvd) was razed when the University of Louisville doubled the size of its main campus, and I-65 was built through the area in the 1960s, which created a physical barrier between it and Shelby Park neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|The Macdonald family {{obtained}} complete {{ownership of}} the park in 1951. After leaving Idlewild, the Mellon family also abandoned the Ligonier Valley Railroad, in decline after the closing of area coal mines and decreased passenger traffic. The railroad ceased operations in 1952. Although the park originally depended on the railroad, its closing had no effect. In 1913, the Lincoln Highway had been established as the first cross-country auto route, stretching from Times Square, New York City, to Lincoln Park, San Francisco. It passed directly by Idlewild on what is now U.S. Route 30. As automobile traffic to the park increased, several <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> <b>and</b> a Gulf Oil gas station, a Mellon company, were added in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Juan caused {{widespread}} {{structural and}} vegetation damage across the region, particularly {{in and around}} the Halifax Regional Municipality. Extensive damage to trees was reported, which blocked many streets and knocked down power lines. Many homes and businesses suffered property damage, particularly roof damage on structures, and some weaker structures were destroyed. HRM estimated that 31% of residential homes suffered some degree of damage and 27% of homes had enough damage to warrant an insurance claim. In Downtown Halifax, erosion-control boulders the size of garbage cans were hurled from Halifax Harbour onto boardwalks and <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> <b>and</b> piers. The Victoria General Hospital experienced roof and water damage and was evacuated during the storm, as were numerous tall apartment buildings and other multi-family residences. Billboards and signs were also destroyed, and dozens of vehicles were crushed by trees and other debris. The city's cherished Point Pleasant Park and Public Gardens suffered massive loss of trees and remained closed for months.|$|E
5|$|The missing {{connection}} between US 1 and MD 295 {{resulted in a}} circuitous path for traffic between I-95 and BWI Airport. In 1974, that route involved exiting I-95 at MD 100, which then served as a connector between the Interstate and US 1. Traffic took US 1 south to MD 176, then took MD 176 east to MD 295 and north to {{the western end of}} MD 46. Construction on the missing link, which by then was planned as part of I-195, began in 1987, when the highway's bridges over US 1 and I-895 were constructed. The remainder of the highway from MD 295 to the I-895 overpass was completed, including reconstruction of the interchange with MD 295, and the intermediate section opened in June 1990. The I-195 designation was applied to the highway's present length at the same time, and MD 166 was truncated to its present southern terminus. In 2002, as part of an expansion project at the airport, several new ramps were constructed to access <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> <b>and</b> facilitate an easier U-turn for motorists leaving the terminal who wish to return to the terminal. In 2015, the eastern terminus of I-195 was cut back from the BWI Airport to the MD 170 interchange, with the section of road between those two points becoming MD 995A.|$|E

5|$|While the Silver Line was {{originally}} planned to terminate at Stadium-Armory, in 2012 {{the plan was}} changed for the line to end at Largo Town Center instead, because Stadium-Armory's pocket track is too short for trains to turn around. It follows the Blue and Orange Line tracks through DC, continuing through Arlington along the Orange Line and branching off immediately east of the West Falls Church station. The new tracks run in the median of the Dulles Connector Road to an elevated bridge, which takes them over Virginia Route 123. Two elevated stops along {{the west side of}} Route 123 serve the national headquarters of CapitalOne, SAIC and two enclosed Tysons Corner shopping malls. The tracks then enter a tunnel which emerges in the median of Virginia Route 7. Two elevated stations above Route 7 serve the western section of Tysons Corner. The elevated track then swings into the median of the Dulles Access Road until it reaches the airport. Along the way, five new stations would be built with platforms in the median of the access road and a faregate and pedestrian bridges to parking areas elevated above the highway. In anticipation of the Herndon station being built, in 1999 Fairfax County constructed a 1,750-space parking garage with ramps to the Dulles Access Road toll lanes and this facility is being used for bus commuters on an interim basis. The garage has drawn criticism because of alleged construction flaws. As originally planned, upon reaching the airport the track will enter a tunnel which will follow the path of the arrivals driveway of the airport terminal to a station located close to the terminal. The track would leave the tunnel near the airport hotel and economy <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> <b>and</b> would head north parallel to the main runways. A storage yard and maintenance facility would branch off to the west occupying the airport's buffer zone north of the end of its major runways. The final two stops would be in the median of the Dulles Greenway, serving the Ashburn suburb. Hence, the line is expected to draw both airport traffic and commuters from the far western suburbs of Washington, DC. Buses currently provide these users with limited public transportation. In contrast, the Silver Line is expected to provide trains once every six minutes during rush hours and once every fourteen minutes during non-rush hours.|$|E
