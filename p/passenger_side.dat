5|$|In May 2011, all 24,091 C3 Picassos in the UK were {{recalled}} for {{a safety}} modification, following complaints and {{an investigation by}} BBC consumer affairs programme Watchdog into brakes that could be activated on the <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of the right-hand drive vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Penny {{attended}} Castilleja School until 1977. She {{graduated with}} a Bachelor of Arts in economics from Harvard College in 1981. The following year, Penny's mother died after {{falling out of the}} <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of a tow truck. Penny returned to school, earning both a Juris Doctor and a Masters of Business Administration from Stanford University in 1985.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{occurred}} {{because of the}} way the vehicles were modified for right-hand-drive. The investigation showed that although the brake pedal had been moved to the right, it was still connected to a mechanism on the <b>passenger</b> <b>side.</b> This was covered by felt carpet and meant that both the front passenger and driver could activate the brakes. A further investigation by Watchdog later found the same problem in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot, some of which were registered in 2002. All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to identify the severity of the problem but no vehicles were found to be affected enough to issue recalls.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to [...] "pimping", the van {{had a large}} {{bullet hole}} through the <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> windshield.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>passenger</b> <b>side's</b> front airbag, {{steering}} column, {{and exterior}} and interior door handles are from the Chevrolet Cobalt ...|$|R
50|$|Air-conditioning {{was never}} an option on right-hand-drive Saxos because the blower motor was mounted in the bulk-head on the driver's side. As a result, there was {{insufficient}} space available to accommodate the evaporator, except by first ducting the air flow to the <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> {{and then at the}} expense of the glove-box. Although an after-market kit was available that did exactly this, the resultant pressure loss made the system noisy and ineffective. The blower motor could also not be easily relocated, since the windscreen wiper motor was mounted in the <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> space.|$|R
5|$|The {{secondary}} rivalry {{was between}} The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy. On the September 8, 2006 episode of SmackDown!, Kennedy {{announced that he}} was looking for a new opponent, one that he had never faced before. Long informed Kennedy that he knew a SmackDown! superstar that had never faced Kennedy, The Undertaker. A match was made between the two for No Mercy, in which Kennedy defeated Undertaker by disqualification. At Survivor Series, Kennedy once again defeated Undertaker in a First Blood match. On the December 1 episode of SmackDown!, Undertaker fought Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) in a match where neither wrestler won. During the match, MVP was scripted to attempt escaping from the ring, but Kennedy caught him during the process and tried to throw him back into the ring. MVP instead threw Kennedy in. Undertaker then kicked Kennedy in the face, and Kane attacked MVP at ringside. The following week as Kennedy was in the ring, the hearse, appearing to have nobody in the driver's seat, drove into the arena; suddenly, The Undertaker appeared from the back of the hearse, as Kennedy sprung from the ring. Later that night, Kane defeated Kennedy by disqualification after MVP interfered on Kennedy's behalf. On the December 15 episode of SmackDown!, The Undertaker and Kane teamed together to face Kennedy and MVP in a tag team match, which ended in neither team winning. Kennedy knocked Kane down in the aisle and jumped into the driver's seat of the hearse that had been at ringside for the match, and threatened to run him over with it however the Undertaker appeared in the <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> seat scaring Kennedy off.|$|E
25|$|Mounting base: Attaches the {{mounting}} {{system to the}} vehicle. This element is commonly composed of rugged materials such as steel. Tunnel Mounts attach to the raised floor area (drive shaft tunnel) between the driver and passenger. <b>Passenger</b> <b>Side</b> Mounts attach to floor on the <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of the vehicle. Console mounting brackets attach to an existing vehicle center console. Trunk Mounts provide mounting options for use inside car trunks.|$|E
25|$|To {{minimize}} {{production costs}} for export, {{the windshield wipers}} used a pattern where the wipers started {{in the center and}} wiped towards the edge of the windshield, instead of from the <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> towards the driver.|$|E
50|$|In 1987, Toyota {{introduced}} the Tercel EZ with less standard equipment: vinyl upholstery, a four-speed manual transmission, rubber mats instead of carpeting, and a deleted <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> sun visor.|$|R
50|$|The Morkalla railway line {{opened on}} 10 April 1924 with a goods, grain and <b>passenger</b> <b>siding,</b> {{followed}} by the Post Office on 30 May 1924. The railway closed by 1988.|$|R
25|$|From late 1988 on, the W124 {{was one of}} {{the first}} cars {{available}} with a <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> front-airbag as an option, initially only in Europe, and from 1990 onwards in North America.|$|R
25|$|The S70 scored five of five {{stars for}} front impact {{protection}} for driver and front passenger in the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) safety testing, and {{four out of}} five stars for driver and rear <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> impact protection.|$|E
25|$|On October 17, Labonte {{announced}} the GEICO 500 {{is to be}} his 890th and final start. To commemorate the occasion, Go Fas Racing designed a car split into three designs: the Kellogg's design from his 1996 title run on the driver side, the Piedmont Airlines design from his 1984 championship year on the <b>passenger</b> <b>side,</b> and the Duck Industries design from his early career in the center. However, NASCAR did not allow the scheme, due to a rule stating cars must have the same colors on both the driver side and <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of the car for safety reasons; the team would switch to the former design, while being allowed to retain the center. Labonte qualified ninth, {{but because of the}} unapproved paint scheme, was forced to start {{at the tail end of}} the field. He would finish in thirty-third place, one lap down in his final race.|$|E
25|$|One last unique {{addition}} to the new design was a single high mounted rear view mirror on the driver's side. On US based cars, the mirror was lowered to a more normal placement in 1987 and quickly joined by a <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> rear view mirror for the driver {{to be able to}} make safe easy lane changes.|$|E
50|$|As in {{previous}} years, the Top 40 Qualifying cars eligible to start, must have flashing lights installed (for better {{identification of the}} Top 40 competitors) behind the windscreen on the <b>passenger’s</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 2010 {{model year}} offered two updates: all {{passenger}} windows received an automatic up/down function, {{as opposed to}} just the driver and front <b>passenger's</b> <b>side,</b> and a new accelerator pedal was redesigned.|$|R
2500|$|Skyhopper II [...] - {{designed}} in 1962 to sit two <b>passengers</b> <b>side</b> by side via a [...] widening of the Skyhopper 10 fuselage design. It {{was built by}} Ralph Thenhaus of Van Nuys, California.|$|R
25|$|Once Bland {{is out of}} her car, {{the officer}} orders her to put down her cell phone and tells her {{she is going to}} jail. In response, Bland asks why. In the video, both Bland and the officer move to the <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of the vehicle and are no longer visible, while they {{continue}} to argue heatedly. Bland can be heard crying and screaming.|$|E
25|$|An air bag is {{a safety}} feature {{designed}} to protect automobile passengers in a head-on collision. Most cars today have driver's side airbags and many have one on the <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> as well. Located in the steering wheel assembly on the driver's side and in the dashboard on the <b>passenger</b> <b>side,</b> the air bag device responds within milliseconds of a crash. The original safety cushion was first created by John W. Hetrick in 1952. After a car accident that his family was involved in, Hetrick drew sketches of compressed air stored in a container. When a spring-loaded weight senses the car decelerating at a rapid enough rate, it opens a valve that allows the pressure in the container to fill a bag. With this knowledge, he developed his design until {{he was able to}} obtain a patent on the device on August 5, 1952. Later in 1967, Dr. Allen S. Breed invented and developed a key component for automotive use in 1967, the ball-in-tube inertial sensor for crash detection. Breed Corporation then marketed this innovation to Chrysler.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect that}} {{windshield}} wipers {{have on a}} vehicles airflow varies between vehicles; however, they are often omitted from race vehicles and high efficiency concepts {{in order to maintain}} the smallest possible coefficient of drag. A much more common option is to replace the windshield wipers with lower profile wipers, or to only remove the windshield wiper on the <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of the vehicle, and even to fabricate a deflector to deflect the air up and over the wipers.|$|E
50|$|Each car is {{numbered}} (1 to 100), with a 348 Serie Speciale {{plate on}} the <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> door-post.In 1994, a further 15 units were produced, bringing the total production of this limited edition to 115.|$|R
50|$|The PUMA design {{transfers}} the two-wheeled self-balancing {{characteristics of}} a Segway PT into a vehicle that can carry two <b>passengers</b> <b>side</b> by side at up to 35 mph for a distance of up to 35 mi.|$|R
5000|$|Options {{available}} at extra cost included velour carpeting, grab handles for the passengers in the back, whitewall tires, a two tone paint finish {{and even a}} [...] "make-up mirror" [...] cleverly incorporated into the sun-visor on the <b>passenger's</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
25|$|On many {{automobile}} engines, {{including all}} Chrysler Group and General Motors products, the thermostat does not restrict {{flow to the}} heater core. The <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> tank of the radiator {{is used as a}} bypass to the thermostat, flowing through the heater core. This prevents formation of steam pockets before the thermostat opens, and allows the heater to function before the thermostat opens. Another benefit is that there is still some flow through the radiator if the thermostat fails.|$|E
25|$|Early on July 31, 1977, Stacy Moskowitz and Robert Violante, both 20, were in Violante's car, {{which was}} parked under a streetlight near a city {{park in the}} {{neighborhood}} of Bath Beach. They were kissing when a man approached within three feet of the <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of Violante's car and fired four rounds into the car, striking both victims in the head before he escaped into the park. Moskowitz died several hours later in the hospital. Violante survived, although he lost vision in one eye and retained very limited vision in the other eye.|$|E
25|$|Taxicab {{services}} in Honolulu, Hawaii are {{regulated by the}} City and County of Honolulu. In order to be licensed, drivers must have a valid license, pass written and location tests, a background check from the Honolulu Police Department, a physical exam and a clean driving record. A white placard is then placed on the front <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> with a photo and information, while a sticker identifying the number is placed at the rear bumper sticker. In 2012, more than 1,632 vehicles in Honolulu were registered to operate as taxicab providers.|$|E
50|$|The Azkarra is {{the first}} vehicle {{produced}} by Canadian company Atelier Girfalco Limitée. It is a three-wheel all-electric sports vehicle accommodating two <b>passengers</b> <b>side</b> by side. Production is set to begin in 2017 with first deliveries scheduled for the Spring of 2017.|$|R
50|$|The interior, {{like the}} {{exterior}} and chassis, is made entirely of carbon fiber. There are four screens: {{one on the}} driver's side of the dashboard, one on the <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> of the dashboard, one on the center console, {{and one on the}} steering wheel.|$|R
50|$|Cars sold from 1952 also {{featured}} a fuel-based passenger cabin heater. In order to ignite the heater {{it was necessary}} first to open a small tap in the engine bay, after which the flow of hot air could be regulated using a control in the footwell on the <b>passenger's</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
25|$|Bryant {{then moved}} back to the <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of the Corolla as Hall {{attempted}} to climb over to the driver's seat. Bryant raised his rifle and fired three shots, killing her. Many people around the service station witnessed this and ran to hide in nearby bushland. The service station attendant told everyone to lie down and he locked the main doors. He grabbed his rifle, {{but by the time he}} could retrieve some ammunition and load his gun, Bryant had left in the BMW. A police officer arrived several minutes later and then set out in pursuit of Bryant.|$|E
25|$|Steel {{supports}} {{around the}} quarter lights allowed the windscreen {{to be both}} more steeply raked and moved forwards to provide more interior room. This also allowed a properly sprung bench-type rear seat to be fitted capable of seating two adults. The front seats were adjustable for position and the <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> now folded much further forward than on previous models to allow easier access to the rear, although the doors were still felt to be too narrow for easy entry. Controls were similar to the Mark F, but the fuel tap was now moved from beneath the bonnet to under the dash. Doors were now lockable and included wind-up windows.|$|E
25|$|Most jurisdictions permit rear {{fog lamps}} to be {{installed}} either singly or in pairs. If a single rear fog is fitted, most jurisdictions require it to be located at or to the driver's side of the vehicle's centreline—whichever side is the prevailing driver's side {{in the country in}} which the vehicle is registered. This is to maximize the sight line of following drivers to the rear fog lamp. In many cases, a single reversing lamp is mounted on the <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of the vehicle, positionally symmetrical with the rear fog. If two {{rear fog lamps}} are fitted, they must be symmetrical with respect to the vehicle's centreline.|$|E
2500|$|Driver's and <b>passenger's</b> airbags (<b>side</b> airbags added {{from late}} 2005) ...|$|R
30|$|Since odd HGVs {{are more}} {{susceptible}} to accidents, Rwanda must enact new regulation making it compulsory for the foreign HGVs to be fitted with Fresnel lens or close proximity (Class V) mirror to the <b>passenger’s</b> <b>side</b> widow to resolve the blind spot which can otherwise hinder HGV drivers’ vision of other traffic.|$|R
50|$|Their car was {{reportedly}} traveling 130 km/h, when it veered into oncoming traffic lanes at the 60th kilometer of the Belgrade—Niš highway, colliding head-on with a FAP truck driven by 52-year-old Rastko Grujić. Armenulić {{had been sleeping}} in the <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> seat and her younger sister was asleep in the back seat.|$|R
