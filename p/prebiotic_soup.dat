Mathematically treated, hypercycles could create quasispecies, which through natural selection entered into a form of Darwinian evolution. A boost to hypercycle theory was the discovery of ribozymes capable of catalyzing their own chemical reactions. The hypercycle theory requires the existence of complex biochemicals, such as nucleotides, which do not form under the conditions proposed by the Miller–Urey experiment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{beginning}} {{of life and}} living organisms is difficult to specifically date as proto-organisms' earliest existence left no paleontological clues. Cavalier-Smith argues that initially there was primordial soup which contained amino acids, the building blocks for proteins. Replication and phosphorylation were not relevant until the <b>prebiotic</b> <b>soup</b> started to become organized into the [...] "nucleic acid" [...] era. Although still not [...] "living," [...] the substances during this period could replicate and undergo organized chemical processes. Based off these orderly processes, the world transitioned into an obcell world which included coding for proteins and chromosomes and the symbiotic interactions between membranes, genes, and enzymes. Obcells probably had a single membrane that was lipid-dense and also had specific cytoskeletal proteins that gave the obcells its curvature. These skeletal proteins were probably contained within the obcell's protoperiplasm.|$|E
5000|$|Haldane {{introduced}} the modern concept of abiogenesis in an eight-page article titled The {{origin of life}} in the Rationalist Annual in 1929, describing the primitive ocean as a [...] "vast chemical laboratory" [...] containing a mixture of inorganic compounds - like a [...] "hot dilute soup" [...] in which organic compounds could have formed. Under the solar energy the anoxic atmosphere containing carbon dioxide, ammonia and water vapour gave rise to a variety of organic compounds, [...] "living or half-living things". The first molecules reacted with one another to produce more complex compounds, and ultimately the cellular components. At some point a kind of [...] "oily film" [...] was produced that enclosed self-replicating nucleic acids, thereby becoming the first cell. J.D. Bernal named the hypothesis biopoiesis or biopoesis, the process of living matter spontaneously evolving from self-replicating but lifeless molecules. Haldane further hypothesised that viruses were the intermediate entities between the <b>prebiotic</b> <b>soup</b> and the first cells. He asserted that prebiotic life would have been [...] "in the virus stage for many millions of years before a suitable assemblage of elementary units was brought together in the first cell." [...] The idea was generally dismissed as [...] "wild speculation". In 1924 Alexander Oparin had suggested similar idea in Russian, and in 1936 he introduced it to the English-speaking people. The experimental basis of the theory began in 1953 with the classic Miller-Urey experiment. Since then, the primordial soup theory became a dominant theory in the chemistry of life, and often is attributed as the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis.|$|E

Strangely, the scientific community long remained reluctant to establish a physical equivalence between the abstract notion of information and sensible thermodynamics. However, certain physicists such as Szilard and Brillouin proposed: (i) to give to information {{the status of a}} genuine thermodynamic entity (k B T ln 2 joules/bit) and (ii) to link the capacity of storing information inferred from correlated systems, to that of indefinitely increasing organization. This positive feedback coupled to the self-templating molecular potential could provide a universal basis for the spontaneous rise of highly organized structures, typified by the emergence of life from a <b>prebiotic</b> chemical <b>soup.</b> Once established, this mechanism ensures the longevity and robustness of life envisioned as a general system, by allowing it to accumulate and optimize microstate-reducing recipes, thereby giving rise to strong nonlinearity, decisional capacity and multistability.

Similarly, even the simplest living organisms appear to be complex biochemical systems of coadapted molecules. It is extremely difficult to explain how such a first living organism could have been assembled by random combination of molecules in the hypothetical <b>prebiotic</b> <b>soup.</b> A mechanism is proposed to account for the appearance of complex biochemical systems of co-adapted molecules, essentially machines, both in living organisms and in the <b>prebiotic</b> <b>soup.</b> This mechanism is not consistent with current understanding of the genetic code and, if true, would indicate that current understanding of the genetic code is incomplete.

40|$|AbstractRNA strand {{exchange}} through phosphor-nucleotidyl transfer reactions is {{an intrinsic}} chemistry promoted by group I intron ribozymes. We show here that Tetrahymena and Azoarcus ribozymes can promote RNA oligonucleotide recombination in either two-pot or one-pot schemes. These ribozymes bind one oligonucleotide, cleave following a guide sequence, transfer the 3 ′ {{portion of the}} oligo to their own 3 ′ end, bind a second oligo, and catalyze another transfer reaction to generate recombinant oligos. Recombination is most effective with the Azoarcus ribozyme in a single reaction vessel in which over 75 % of the second oligo can be rapidly converted to recombinant product. The Azoarcus ribozyme can also create a new functional RNA, a hammerhead ribozyme, which can be constructed via recombination and then immediately promote its own catalysis in a homogeneous milieu, mimicking events in a <b>prebiotic</b> <b>soup...</b>|$|E
40|$|Pairs of {{antiparallel}} β polypeptide-chain {{segments in}} known protein structures are usually observed to form right-handed double helixes with helix parameters {{in the same}} range as those of nucleic acids. We have constructed a model containing only standard bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles in which such a polypeptide double helix fits precisely into the minor groove of an RNA double helix with identical helix parameters. The geometry of the RNA portion is essentially a hybrid between those of the A and A′ forms. Hydrogen bonds can be made between the ribose 2 ′-hydroxyls and polypeptide carbonyl oxygens. Since such precise complementarity between the stable conformations of RNA and polypeptides {{is unlikely to be}} merely coincidental, we propose that it played a fundamental role in the initiation of precellular evolution. Specificially, we propose that the two double-helical structures are mutually catalytic for assembly of one another from activated precursors in the <b>prebiotic</b> <b>soup,</b> and moreover that they provide some degree of genetic coding...|$|E
40|$|The RNA World {{hypothesis}} {{describes a}} period of time during the origins of life in which RNA molecules performed all catalysis and were the only form of information storage. A great deal of evidence has been obtained in support of this hypothesis, however a few key demonstrations are lacking. The first demonstration is of a molecule capable of self-replication that could have plausibly arisen from the <b>prebiotic</b> <b>soup.</b> Previously in the Lehman Laboratory, a 198 -nucleotide RNA was discovered that could be fragmented into as many as four pieces ranging from 39 - 63 nucleotides in length. When these pieces were incubated together in a test tube, they re-formed the necessary covalent bonds to regenerate the full-length 198 -nucleotide RNA. Furthermore, the full-length RNAs were catalytically active and made copies of themselves from the remaining pieces in solution, providing a model system of self-replication.

40|$|The {{connection}} between astrobiology and green chemistry represents {{a new approach}} to sustainability of organic matter on asteroids or similar bodies. Green chemistry is chemistry which is environmentally friendly. One obvious way for chemistry to be green is to use water as a solvent, instead of more toxic organic solvents. Many astrobiological reactions occur in the aqueous medium, for example in the <b>prebiotic</b> <b>soup</b> or during the aqueous alteration period on asteroids. Thus any advances in the green organic reactions in water are directly applicable to astrobiology. Another green chemistry approach is to abolish use of toxic solvents. This can be accomplished by carrying out the reactions without a solvent in the solventless or solid-state reactions. The advances in these green reactions are directly applicable to the chemistry on asteroids during the periods when water was not available. Many reactions on asteroids may have been done in the solid mixtures. These reactions may be responsible for a myriad of organic compounds that have been isolated from the meteorites. green chemistry; astrobiology; solventless reactions; solid-state reactions; Diels-Alder reactions in water; asteroids; meteorites...|$|E
40|$|The {{link between}} non-enzymatic RNA {{polymerization}} and RNA self-replication {{is a key}} step towards the “RNA world” and still far from being solved, despite extensive research. Clay minerals, lipids and, more recently, peptides were found to catalyze the non-enzymatic synthesis of RNA oligomers. Herein, {{a review of the}} main models for the formation of the first RNA polymers is presented {{in such a way as}} to emphasize the cooperation between life’s building blocks in their emergence and evolution. A logical outcome of the previous results is a combination of these models, in which RNA polymerization might have been catalyzed cooperatively by clays, lipids and peptides in one multi-component <b>prebiotic</b> <b>soup.</b> The resulting RNAs and oligopeptides might have mutualistically evolved towards functional RNAs and catalytic peptides, preceding the first RNA replication, thus supporting an RNA-peptide world. The investigation of such a system is a formidable challenge, given its complexity deriving from a tremendously large number of reactants and innumerable products. A rudimentary experimental design is outlined, which could be used in an initial attempt to study a quaternary component system...|$|E
40|$|The RNA World {{hypothesis}} {{proposes a}} period of time during the origins of life in which RNA molecules were the only source of both genotypes and phenotypes. Although a vast amount of evidence has been obtained in support of this hypothesis, a few critical demonstrations are lacking. A most crucial one is a demonstration of self-replication of RNA molecule from <b>prebiotic</b> <b>soup.</b> Previously in the Lehman laboratory, it has been demonstrated that a 198 -nucleotide molecule derived from the Azoarcus group I intron can self-assemble from up to four fragments of RNA via recombination. Furthermore, the covalent full-length molecules are catalytically active and can make copies of themselves from the remaining pieces in the solution leading to their autocatalytic growth. I was able to demonstrate how this recombination system can overcome different obstacles and evolve to be an efficient replicating system. I discovered the ability of a single RNA fragment to be multifunctional in a single reaction pathway during RNA recombination events that avoids the necessity of multiple genotypes. I also confirmed the capacity of self-replicating ribozymes to form cooperative catalytic cycles and networks that would potentially prevent informational decay. Finally, I have discovered a recycling phenomenon in the RNA recombination system that exploits dynamic covalent chemistry. Recycling provides the earliest replicating system with adequate concentrations of reagents and ability to explore sequence space. Together these findings have improved our understanding of RNA recombination and bolstered the plausibility of the RNA World...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} in the literature that under proper conditions the simultaneous coordination of cyanide and cyanogen is possible [1, 21. Since in the early stage of chemical evolution both cyanide ion and cyanogen were among the common materials [3], it seems fairly likely that in this age cyanogen-containing cyanocomplexes could occur in the <b>prebiotic</b> <b>soup</b> and the behaviour of these complexes should be considered {{from the point of view}} of prebiotic syntheses. We prepared a new cyanogen-containing complex and found that glycine is formed in its hydrolysis. Results and Discussion Preparation of the Complex CuC&fi 30 Originally we intended to prepare the dicyano-cyanogen-copper(I) complex described by S. K. Tobia et al. [l], but their experiment could not be quantitatively reproduced and only traces of the complex described by these authors could be ob-tained. However, we prepared a new complex with good yield according to the following synthetic procedure. To a 60 ml 10 M sodium cyanide solution, cooled by an ice bath, 133 ml 1. 5 M copper sulphate solu-tion was added dropwise, under vigorous stirring. The colour of the solution turned to purple, then became brown and a brown material precipitated abundantly. The final molar ratio of Cu:CN in the solution was 1 : 3. The precipitate was filtered off and washed with cold distilled water and finally dried over Pz 05. The yield varied between 8 and 10 g. The copper content of the complex was deter-mined spectrophotometrically, while C, N, H and 0 were determined by elemental analysis. The data in parentheses are calculated values assuming th...|$|E
40|$|During the {{evolution}} of many systems found in nature, both the system composition and the interactions between com-ponents will vary. Equating the dimension {{with the number of}} different components, a system which adds or deletes com-ponents belongs to a class of dynamical systems with a finite dimensional phase space of variable dimension. We present two models of biochemical systems with a variable phase space, a model of autocatalytic reaction etworks in the <b>prebiotic</b> <b>soup</b> and a model of the idiotypie network of the immune system. Each model contains characteristic recta-dynamical rules for constructing equations of motion from component properties. The simulation of each model occurs on two levels. On one level, the equations of motion are integrated to determine the state of each component. On a second level, algorithms which approximate physical processes in the real system are employed to change the equations of motion. Models with meta-dynamical ru es possess everal advantages for the study of evolving systems. First, there are no explicit fitness functions to determine how the components of the model rank in terms of survivability. The success of any component is a function of its relationship to the res ~ of the system. A second advantage is that since the phase space representation f the system is always:~inite but continually changing, we can explore a potentially infinite phase space which would other-wise be inaccessible with finite computer resources. Third, the enlarged capacity of systems with meta-dynamics for varia-tion allows us to conduct rue evolution experiments. The modeling methods presented here can be applied to many real biological systems. In the two studies we present, we are investigating two apparent properties of adaptive networks...|$|E
40|$|There is convincing paleontological {{evidence}} {{showing that}} stromatolitebuilding phototactic prokaryotes {{were already in}} existence 3. 5 x 10 (9) years ago. Late accretion impacts may have killed off life on our planet as late as 3. 8 x 10 (9) years ago. This leaves only 300 million years to go freom the <b>prebiotic</b> <b>soup</b> to the RNA world and to cyanobacteria. However, 300 million years should be more than sufficient time. All known prebiotic reactions take place in geologically rapid time scales, and very slow prebiotic reactions are not feasible because the intermediate compounds would have been destroyed due {{to the passage of}} the entire ocean through deepsea vents every 10 (7) years or in even less time. Therefore, it is likely that selfreeplicating systems capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution emerged in a period shorter than the destruction rates of its components (< 5 million years). The time for evolution freom the first DNA/protein organisms to cyanobacteria is usually thought to be very long. However, the similarities of many enzymatic reactions, together with the analysis of the available sequence data, suggest that a significant number of the components involved in basic biological processes are the result of ancient gene duplication events. Assuming that the rate of gene duplication of ancient prokaryotes was comparable to today's present values, the development of a filamentous cyanobacteriallike genome would require approximately 7 x 10 (6) yearsor perhaps much less. Thus, in spite of the many uncertainties involved in the estimates of time for life to arise and evolve to cyanobacteria, we see no compelling reason to assume that this process, freom the beginning of the primitive soup to cyanobacteria, took more than 10 million years...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} are to propose, {{construct}} and analyse microscopic kinetic models {{for the emergence of}} long chains of RNA from monomeric beta-D-ribonucleotide precursors in prebiotic circumstances. Our theory starts out from similar but more general chemical assumptions to those of Eigen, namely that catalytic replication can lead to a large population of long chains. In particular, our models incorporate the possibility of (i) direct chain growth, (ii) template-assisted synthesis and (iii) catalysis by RNA replicase ribozymes, all with varying degrees of efficiency. However, in our models the reaction mechanisms are kept `open'; we do not assume the existence of closed hypercycles which sustain a population of long chains. Rather it is the feasibility of the initial emergence of a self-sustaining set of RNA chains from monomeric nucleotides which is our prime concern. We confront directly the central nonlinear features of the problem, which have often been overlooked in previous studies. Our detailed microscopic kinetic models lead to kinetic equations which are generalisations of the Becker-Doring system (BD) for the step-wise growth of clusters or polymer chains; they lie within a general theoretical framework which has recently been successfully applied {{to a wide range of}} complex chemical problems. In fact, the most accurate model we consider has BD aggregation terms, together with a general Smoluchowski fragmentation term to model the competing hydrolysis of RNA polymer chains. We conclude that, starting from reasonable initial conditions of monomeric nucleotide concentrations within a <b>prebiotic</b> <b>soup</b> and in an acceptable timescale, it is possible for a self-replicating subset of polyribonucleotide chains to be selected, while less efficient replicators become extinct.

40|$|The basic {{tenet of}} the {{heterotrophic}} {{theory of the}} origin of life is that the maintenance and reproduction of the first living systems depended primarily on prebiotically synthesized organic molecules. It is unlikely that any single mechanism can account for the wide range of organic compounds that may have accumulated on the primitive Earth, suggesting that the <b>prebiotic</b> <b>soup</b> was formed by contributions freom endogenous syntheses in reducing environments. metal sulphidemediated synthesis in deepsea vents, and exogenous sources such as comets, meteorites and interplanetary dust. The wide range of experimental conditions under which amino acids and nucleobases can be synthesized suggests that the abiotic syntheses of these monomers did not take place under a narrow range defined by highly selective reaction conditions, but rather under a wide variety of settings. The robustness of this type of chemistry is supported by the occurrence of most of these biochemical compounds in the Murchison meteorite. These results lend strong credence to the hypothesis that the emergence of life was the outcome of a long, but not necessarily slow evolutionary processes. The origin of life may be best understood in terms of the dynamics and evolution of sets (if chemical replicating entities. Whether such entities were enclosed within membranes is not yet clear, but given the prebiotic availability of amphiphilic compounds this may have well been the case. This scheme is not at odds with the theoretical models of selforganized emerging systems, but what is known of biology suggest that the essential traits of living systems could have not emerged in the absence of genetic material able to store, express and, upon a replication, transmit to its progeny information capable of undergoing evolutionary change. How such genetic polymer first evolved is a central issue in originoflife studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Following the {{publication}} of the Origin of Species in 1859, many naturalists adopted the idea that living organisms were the historical outcome of gradual transformation of lifeless matter. These views soon merged with the developments of biochemistry and cell biology and led to proposals in which the origin of protoplasm was equated with the origin of life. The heterotrophic origin of life proposed by Oparin and Haldane in the 1920 s was part of this tradition, which Oparin enriched by transforming the discussion of the emergence of the first cells into a workable multidisciplinary research program. On the other hand, the scientific trend toward understanding biological phenomena at the molecular level led authors like Troland, Muller, and others to propose that single molecules or viruses represented primordial living systems. The contrast between these opposing views on the origin of life represents not only contrasting views of the nature of life itself, but also major ideological discussions that reached a surprising intensity in the years following Stanley Miller's seminal result which showed the ease with which organic compounds of biochemical significance could be synthesized under putative primitive conditions. In fact, during the years following the Miller experiment, attempts to understand the origin of life were strongly influenced by research on DNA replication and protein biosynthesis, and, in sociopolitical terms, by the atmosphere created by Cold War tensions. The catalytic versatility of RNA molecules clearly merits a critical reappraisal of Muller's viewpoint. However, the discovery of ribozymes does not imply that autocatalytic nucleic acid molecules ready to be used as primordial genes were floating in the primitive oceans, or that the RNA world emerged completely assembled freom simple precursors present in the <b>prebiotic</b> <b>soup.</b> The evidence supporting the presence {{of a wide range of}} organic molecules on the primitive Earth, including membraneforming compounds, suggests that the evolution of membranebounded molecular systems preceded cellular life on our planet, and that life is the evolutionary outcome of a process, not of a single, fortuitous event...|$|E
