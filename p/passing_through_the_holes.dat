50|$|Several factors {{serve to}} limit the {{shielding}} capability of real RF shields. One is that, due to the electrical resistance of the conductor, the excited field does not completely cancel the incident field. Also, most conductors exhibit a ferromagnetic response to low-frequency magnetic fields, so that such fields are not fully attenuated by the conductor. Any holes in the shield force current to flow around them, so that fields <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> do not excite opposing electromagnetic fields. These effects reduce the field-reflecting capability of the shield.|$|E

5000|$|A {{shadow mask}} is a metal plate punched with tiny holes that {{separate}} the colored phosphors in the layer {{behind the front}} glass of the screen. Three electron guns {{at the back of}} the screen sweep across the mask, with the beams only reaching the screen if they pass through the holes. As the guns are physically separated {{at the back of the}} tube, their beams approach the mask from three slightly different angles, so after <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> they hit slightly different locations on the screen. The screen is patterned with dots of colored phosphor positioned so that each can only be hit by one of the beams coming from the three electron guns. For instance, the blue phosphor dots are hit by the beam from the [...] "blue gun" [...] after passing through a particular hole in the mask. The other two guns do the same for the red and green dots. This arrangement allows the three guns to address the individual dot colors on the screen, even though their beams are much too large and too poorly aimed to do so without the mask in place.|$|E
30|$|The {{following}} {{may serve}} as an example. At {{the end of the}} 19 th century Herman Hollerith combined punch cards having holes in specific places – a device known from mechanic musical instruments – with the cognitive concept of coding numbers by the arrangement of holes on the cards. In mechanic musical instruments, this technique was used for coding musical notes. Air pressure <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> of the punch cards triggered an acoustic tone in pipes, strings or bells associated with the holes. Hollerith not only replaced musical notes by numbers. He also combined his punch cards with an electric reading device replacing air pressure: spring-mounted needles made an electrical connection when <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes.</b> Taken in isolation, all of the elements which Hollerith combined were no new concepts, yet their combination was. In fact, it was the first electro-mechanically machine able to tabulate and sort numerical information automatically. This {{turned out to be a}} major innovation when introduced to the market by the Tabulating Machine Company, later Computer Tabulating Recording Company renamed IBM in 1924 (see (Kistermann 1991)).|$|E
40|$|Optical {{transition}} radiation (OTR) interferometry {{has been shown}} to be a useful diagnostic for measuring the divergence of electron beams over a wide range of beam energies (15 MeV- 230 MeV) [1]. However, beam scattering in the first foil of the interferometer ultimately limits the useful range of such a device. To overcome this effect we have designed and tested a perforated front foil interferometer to measure divergence of electron beams in the range of 100 - 1000 micro radians. Unscattered beam electrons <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> in the screen produce optical diffraction radiation (ODR), while those passing through the solid portion produce OTR. For the proper hole size, number and screen thickness, the ODR-OTR interferences are readily observable above an incoherent background produced by the scattered electrons. The fringe visibility provides a measurement of beam divergence. The results of proof of principle measurements are presented. In addition, we introduce a novel design for an interferometer useful for the diagnosis of low energy, low emittance beams...|$|E

40|$|A brief {{survey of}} {{underground}} temperature at Yuba in Ooshima Island was made (Fig. 1). Yuba {{is known for}} a natural steam-bath and {{is located on the}} outer slope of the somma of the Volcano Mihara. The temperature measurement was conducted by thermistors. 14 hard vinyl-tubes with a length of 1 - 2 m were buried vertically around the steam-bath as seen in Fig. 2 and the thermistors were inserted into them. The results are listed in Table I and Fig. 4, in which it is noticed that the temperature rises with depth actually in some holes near the steam-bath. Based upon these data, temperature profiles for the vertical sections <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> 10, 9, 6, 2, 12 and 4, 14, 7, 5, 2, 3, 13 (Fig. 5 a, b) and an isothermal contour map at a depth of 1 m (Fig. 6) were tentatively plotted. An underground hot body separated from the steam-bath itself can be clearly observed from these figures. By using the observed temperature gradient at a depth between 1 m and 2 m and by assuming the thermal conductivity of the soil as 0. 001 cal/cm. sec. deg., the approximate amount of heat flow was estimated to be of the order of 10 - 5 cal/sec. cm 2 near the hot bodies.

40|$|Optical {{transition}} radiation interferometry (OTRI) {{has been shown}} to be a very useful technique to measure the divergence of electron beams with energies in the range of 15 - 100 MeV. However, application of this method to low energy or very high quality beams is limited by scattering in the front foil of the interferometer. To overcome this limitation we propose to use a perforated front foil. For the beam energy and hole sizes we are considering, the unscattered beam electrons <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> will produce diffraction radiation (ODR). The total radiation produced from the first and second foils then will be a spatially coherent sum of ODR and OTR from unscattered and scattered electrons. By controlling the number and size of the perforations, the inter-foil spacing, the thickness of the first foil and the wavelength and band pass of the observed radiation, the coherent interferences due to the unscattered portion of the beam can be isolated and observed. The visibility of these interferences can then be used to determine the rms beam divergence. We have developed a general computer code which can be used to calculate diffraction radiation from any type of perforation and another code to compute the ODR-OTR interference pattern for a given set of beam and optical parameters. These codes are employed in the design of an interferometer to measure the divergence of the ATF accelerator operating at 30 MeV. This beam will be used in an initial proof of principle experiment for the ODR-OTR interferometer. We present the results of our code calculations which show that the expected divergence, 200 micro radians, can be easily measured.

Extinctions indicated a space group of Cc or C 2 /c; a satisfactory structure was {{obtained in the}} latter with 6 molecules/asymmetric unit - C 54 O 36 H 36 with a formula weight of 1261 g. Of approximately 12, 000 independent reflections within the CuK α sphere, intensities of 11, 563 were recorded visually from equi-inclination Weissenberg photographs. The structure was solved by packing considerations aided by molecular transforms and two- and three-dimensional Patterson functions. Hydrogen positions were found on difference maps. A total of 978 parameters were refined by least squares; these included hydrogen parameters and anisotropic temperature factors for the C and O atoms. The final R factor was 0. 0675; the final "goodness of fit" was 1. 49. All calculations were carried out on the Caltech IBM 7040 - 7094 computer using the CRYRM Crystallographic Computing System. The six independent molecules fall into two groups of three nearly parallel molecules. All molecules are connected by carboxylto- carboxyl hydrogen bond pairs to form a continuous array of sixmolecule rings with a chicken-wire appearance. These arrays bend to assume two orientations, forming pleated sheets. Arrays in different orientations interpenetrate - three molecules in one orientation <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> of three parallel arrays in the alternate orientation - to produce a completely interlocking network.

Optical transforms as related to x-ray diffraction patterns are discussed with reference to the theory of Fraunhofer diffraction. The use of a systems approach in crystallographic computing is discussed with special emphasis on the way in which this has been done at the California Institute of Technology.

Expressions for the calculation of to-scale maps for standard sections and for general-plane sections are developed; space-group-specific expressions in a form suitable for computers are given for all space groups except the hexagonal ones.

40|$|A small mass {{spectrometer}} utilizing a miniature field ionization source is now undergoing development. It {{is designed for}} use in a variety of applications in which there are requirements for a lightweight, low-power-consumption instrument that can analyze the masses {{of a wide variety of}} molecules and ions. The device can operate without need for a high-vacuum, carrier-gas feed radioactive ionizing source, or thermal ionizer. This {{mass spectrometer}} can operate either in the natural vacuum of outer space or on Earth at any ambient pressure below 50 torr (below about 6. 7 kPa) - a partial vacuum that can easily be reached by use of a small sampling pump. This mass spectrometer also has a large dynamic range - from singly charged small gas ions to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragments larger than 104 atomic mass units - with sensitivity adequate for detecting some molecules and ions at relative abundances of less than one part per billion. This instrument (see figure) includes a field ionizer integrated with a rotating-field mass spectrometer (RFMS). The field ionizer effects ionization of a type characterized as "soft" in the art because it does not fragment molecules or initiate avalanche arcing. What makes the "soft" ionization mode possible is that the distance between the ionizing electrodes is less than mean free path for ions at the maximum anticipated operating pressure, so that the ionizer always operates on the non-breakdown side of the applicable Paschen curve (a standard plot of breakdown potential on the ordinate and pressure electrode separation on the abscissa). The field ionizer in this instrument is fabricated by micromachining a submicron-thick membrane out of an electrically nonconductive substrate, coating the membrane on both sides to form electrodes, then micromachining small holes through the electrodes and membrane. Because of the submicron electrode separation, even a potential of only 1 V applied between the electrodes gives rise to an electric field with a strength of in excess of a megavolt per meter strong enough to ionize any gas molecules <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes.</b> An accelerator grid and an electrostatic deflector focus the ions from the field ionizer into the rotating-field cell of the RFMS. The potentials applied to the electrodes of the cell to generate the rotating electric field typically range from 1 to 13 V. The ions travel in well-defined helices within this cell, after which they are collected in a Faraday cup. The mass of most of the molecules reaching the Faraday cup decreases with increasing frequency of rotation of the electric field in the cell. Therefore, the frequency of rotation of the electric field is made to vary in order to scan through a desired range of ion masses: For example, lightweight gas molecules are scanned at frequencies in the megahertz range, while DNA and other large organic molecules are scanned at kilohertz frequencies...|$|E
