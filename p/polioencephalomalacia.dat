5000|$|<b>Polioencephalomalacia</b> (PEM), also {{referred}} to as cerebrocortical necrosis (CCN), is a neurological disease seen in ruminants that is caused by disrupted thiamine production in the body. Thiamine is a key chemical in glucose metabolism that, when definicient, is most threatening to neurological activity. Cattles, sheep, goat, and other ruminants that are diagnosed with PEM or pre-PEM suffer opishotonus, cortical blindness, disoriented movement, and eventually fatality, if left untreated. Current data shows that the onset of PEM can range from birth to late adulthood.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Polioencephalomalacia</b> (PEM) is {{the most}} common {{thiamine}} deficiency disorder in young ruminant and nonruminant animals. Symptoms of PEM include a profuse, but transient, diarrhea, listlessness, circling movements, star gazing or opisthotonus (head drawn back over neck), and muscle tremors. [...] The most common cause is high-carbohydrate feeds, leading to the overgrowth of thiaminase-producing bacteria, but dietary ingestion of thiaminase (e.g., in bracken fern), or inhibition of thiamine absorption by high sulfur intake are also possible. [...] Another cause of PEM is Clostridium sporogenes or Bacillus aneurinolyticus infection. These bacteria produce thiaminases that will cause an acute thiamine deficiency in the affected animal.|$|E
5000|$|Stimulating {{the menace}} reflex {{is used as}} a {{diagnostic}} procedure in veterinary medicine, in order to determine whether an animal's visual system, in particular the cortical nerve, has suffered from nerve damage. Cortical damage, particularly cerebral lesions, can cause loss of the menace reflex while leaving the other blink reflexes, such as the dazzle reflex, unaffected. [...] The presence or absence of the menace reflex, in combination with other reflexes, indicates a locus of damage. For example, an animal with <b>polioencephalomalacia</b> will lack the menace reflex, but will still have the pupillary light reflex. Polioencephalomacia damages the visual cortex, impairing the menace reflex, but leaves the optic nerve, oculomotor nucleus, and oculomotor nerve intact, leaving the pupillary light reflex unaffected. Contrastingly, an animal with ocular hypovitaminosis-A will suffer from degeneration of the optic nerve, and such an animal presents with a lack of both reflexes.|$|E

40|$|Data {{on blood}} glucose {{concentration}} in bulls affected with molasses associated <b>polioencephalomalacia</b> are controversial.

The results showed significantly greater hyperglycemic responses in the animals during the molasses diet than during the forage one. This probably means that glucose stores (as glycogen) are higher in cattle consuming molasses than those consuming forage. Such hepatic glucose output is in disagreement with the hypoglycemia theory as the cause of the early stages of brain lesions and focuses the probable cause as being related to glucose utilization...|$|E

40|$|Fecal thiaminase was {{measured}} on 152 feedlot cattle at three locations {{and on a}} variety of rations. No animals showed signs of <b>polioencephalomalacia.</b> Thiaminase activities ranged from 0. 6 to 430 µmol thiamin destroyed per minute per liter of feces (µmol/min/l). Eighty-two percent of the thiaminase activities were below 20 µmol/min/l, and only 3 percent were less than 2 µmol/min/l. High levels of fecal thiaminase were apparently not related to ration. Thiaminase was detected in all animals studied, but one location had only minimal levels. When high levels of thiaminase were found, the samples were re-assayedt and the enzyme was confirmed to be thiaminase type I. Polioencephalomalaciat a central nervous system disease in ruminants, involves gastrointestinal destruction of thiamint and the creation, through the action of thiaminase I and a cosubstratet of a thiamin analog that inhibits thiamin-requiring metabolic reactions.

40|$|Distillers grains with {{solubles}} {{are becoming}} {{an increasingly important}} staple of cattle diets because of rapid expansion of the fuel ethanol industry. Sulfuric acid often is used in ethanol production processes to clean and control the pH of fermenters. Consequently, distillers grains with solubles can occasionally contain high sulfur concentrations. Within the rumen, sulfur is converted to hydrogen sulfide gas by ruminal microbes. Hydrogen sulfide is eructated from the rumen and subsequently aspirated into the lungs; excess amounts of hydrogen sulfide can cause <b>polioencephalomalacia</b> (brainers). <b>Polioencephalomalacia</b> is characterized by increased respiration, decreased feed intake, listlessness, muscular incoordination, progressive blindness, and necrosis of brain tissue. Elevated sulfur levels also may have deleterious effects on cattle growth performance and carcass characteristics.

40|$|Abstract. Eight {{dogs with}} severe {{neurologic}} signs, including seizures, had polioencephal-omalacia of the pyriform cortex, Ammon’s horn and deep {{structures in the}} temporal lobe. The <b>polioencephalomalacia</b> {{was considered to be}} a consequence of canine distemper virus infection based on clinical signs, typical inclusions, the demonstration of viral antigens in the lesions and of characteristic paramyxovirus nucleocapsids by electron microscopy. Little evidence for neuronal destruction by direct viral activity was found. Selective nerve cell necrosis was attributed to ischemia (vascular lesions and seizure induced consumptive anoxia) and immune mechanisms.

40|$|<b>Polioencephalomalacia</b> as {{a result}} of sulphur excess is a growing problem in cattle and sheep, mainly in young, growing animals. It is common in {{different}} regions of the world. The disease develops favoured by certain conditions such as sustained provision of feed and water with high sulphur content, use of dietary supplements containing sulphur, and a habitat with high hydrogen sulphide concentration. Pathogenesis of the disease is complex, but very important are oxidative-antioxidative imbalance, dysfunction of vessels, and secondary cerebral cortex ischaemia {{as a result}} of direct and/or indirect action of sulphur metabolites, namely hydrogen sulphide, sulphides, and sulphites. Clinical signs and changes in the cerebral cortex in the form of degenerative necrotic lesions are similar to those observed in <b>polioencephalomalacia</b> caused by vitamin B 1 deficiency, and lead and salt intoxication. Highly increased sulphur content (more than 0. 3 - 0. 4 of dry matter) in the diet is the basis for differential diagnosis, as well the high concentration of hydrogen sulphide in gas and sulphides in rumen fluid.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{intent of}} this article is to alert {{biologists}} of a potential mortality factor of moose in agricultural areas. It has long been recognized that ruminants switching from a natural diet of browse (a cellulose-based diet) to one of more readily digestible carbohydrates (a starch-based diet), such as corn and wheat, are predisposed to developing conditions such as enterotoxemia, <b>polioencephalomalacia,</b> acute rumenitis, liver abscesses, laminitis, and to sudden death. These are often secondary to grain overload (acute acidosis) and are frequently documented in cattle and sheep which are moved from pasture to feedlot. Necropsies of 4 moose in North Dakota were not entirely conclusive, but suggested that grain overload occurred and was a cause of mortality. Necropsy findings that supported grain overload as a contributing factor to death included acute rumenitis, isolation of Clostridium perfringens coupled with hemorrhagic enteritis, chronic laminitis, and <b>polioencephalomalacia.</b> Four likely scenarios exist in which grain overload occurs in North Dakota moose including consumption of planted crops such as corn and wheat, access to bait piles mainly intended for deer, access to cattle feeding sites, and access to recreational feeding sites. These findings have important implications for the regulation of baiting and recreational feeding practices in North Dakota and elsewhere in moose range of similar situation.
