40|$|Peer-to-peer {{technology}} has produced thriving {{communities in which}} peers contribute bandwidth to each other. However, when free riding occurs, these communities {{will not be able}} to sustain themselves without incentives to enforce this contribution. This thesis presents Supervised Teaming, a peer-to-peer transfer protocol that gives uploading <b>peers,</b> <b>called</b> supervisors, control over a team of downloading <b>peers,</b> <b>called</b> team members. The team members are given an incentive to transfer data among each other, effectively reducing the upload cost of the supervisors to one piece of data while still duplicating this piece to every team member. Using transport efficiency, time efficiency, and sharing ratio as performance metrics, we prove that Supervised Teaming performs equally to BitTorrent under best-case scenarios and several factors better, depending on the chosen team size, under flash crowds and free riding scenarios. Furthermore, we have implemented a peer-to-peer client that can use both the BitTorrent protocol and a simplified version of the Supervised Teaming protocol. The experiments we have performed with this client verify that Supervised Teaming performs as expected. Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R

To this end, we center our attention on a generic <b>peer,</b> <b>called</b> tagged <b>peer</b> (TP); for each possible logical state of a BT peer-to-peer connection maintained by the TP, we consider a stochastic process which counts the number of such links, and characterize them according to their state.

40|$|Semantic {{mappings}} are correspondences {{that are}} established between instance or schema level vocabularies of autonomous and heterogeneous data sources. The importance of semantic mappings is steadily increasing in recent data sharing architectures as these mappings enable query answering across heterogeneous boundaries. Peer data management systems (PDBMSs) are one such architecture that has semantic mappings at its core. These systems {{are made up}} of fully autonomous network nodes, <b>called</b> <b>peers,</b> which contain data sources to be shared with other <b>peers,</b> <b>called</b> acquaintances. A <b>peer</b> data warehouse (PDW) is a traditional data warehouse (with appropriate dimensions and facts) which is associated with a peer and managed by a PDBMS. We investigate the problem of composing semantic mappings between dimensions and facts of acquainted PDWs. Moreover, we give a distributed algorithm for composing these mappings expressed in the mapping language LAV (Local-As-View). Furthermore, we show that the complexity of the algorithm is quadratic and prove the correctness of the latter. Finally, we conduct several experiments that illustrate the robustness of the algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{the last}} years peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) {{applications}} are emerging as potentially important structures for information, content management and distribution. The most popular P 2 P application in the Internet today is file sharing, which was initially popularized by the Napster system. One of the most used P 2 P network today allowing file sharing for Internet users is BitTorrent, which generates more than 53 % of the P 2 P traffic in the Internet. Up to now very little efforts have been dedicated to develop analytical tools for performance evaluation of a peer in a BT network. The target {{of this paper is}} to propose an analytical model of a <b>peer,</b> <b>called</b> Tagged <b>Peer</b> (TP), with its peer set. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} cognitive {{factors that}} are predictive of learning gains when students learn to solve equations by teaching a synthetic <b>peer,</b> <b>called</b> SimStudent. Previous empirical studies showed that prior knowledge is strongly predictive of post-test scores. However, {{in a recent study}} in the Philippines that replicated our previous study in the USA, there were students with low priorknowledge who tutored their SimStudent better than other equally low prior students. In this paper, we analyze both process data (tutoring interactions) and outcome data (test scores) to understand what makes learning by teaching more effective. The results imply a presence of individual behavioral differences beyond the difference in the prior knowledge that might have affected SimStudent’s learning, which in turn had non-trivial influence on tutor learning...|$|R

40|$|Peer-to-peer environments {{exhibit a}} very high {{diversity}} in individual peer characteristics ranging by orders of magnitude in terms of uptime, available bandwidth, and storage space. Many systems attempt to exploit this resource heterogeneity by using the best performing and most reliable <b>peers,</b> <b>called</b> super-peers, for hosting system services. However, due to inherent decentralisation, scale, dynamism, and complexity of P 2 P environments, self-managing super-peer selection is a challenging problem. In this paper, decentralised aggregation techniques are used to reduce the uncertainty about system properties by approximating the peer utility distribution allowing peers to calculate adaptive thresholds in order to discover appropriate super-peers. Furthermore, a heuristic search algorithm is described that allows super-peers, above a certain utility threshold, to be efficiently discovered and utilised by any peer in the system...|$|R
40|$|We {{expand the}} scope of {{peer-to-peer}} (P 2 P) systems to include the concept of "communities". Communities are analogous to interest groups and can overlap. We use communities as a more natural arrangement of distributed systems. This paper focuses on a novel, pushpull gossiping technique to improve decentralized information dissemination and search within a P 2 P community. To facilitate an efficient gossiping operation, a distributed discovery algorithm first identifies highly influential <b>peers</b> (<b>called</b> seers) in a community. Then, the push phase multicasts information to these seers so that peers can easily and quickly retrieve this information via a pull phase. Our experiments show that pushing gossip information to {{only a small number}} of seers allows a large percentage of peer members to obtain (pull) the information within just two hops...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{flexible}} framework for throttling attackers in peerto-peer media streaming systems.

Since peer-to-peer systems are decentralized, {{it is difficult for}} individual peers to limit the aggregate download bandwidth consumed by other remote peers. This could potentially allow selfish and malicious peers to exhaust the system's available upload bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a framework to provide a solution to this problem by utilizing a subset of trusted <b>peers</b> (<b>called</b> kantoku nodes) that collectively monitor the bandwidth usage of untrusted peers in the system and throttle attackers. This framework has been evaluated through simulation thus far. Experiments with a full implementation on a network testbed are part of our future work...|$|R
