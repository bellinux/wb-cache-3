40|$|The surface {{states of}} Weyl semi-metals (SM's) consist of disjointed Fermi-arcs. This unusual surface-Fermiology {{provides}} a fingerprint of the topological {{features of the}} bulk Weyl-phase. Using a combination of semiclassical and numerical methods, we show that, in contrast to naive expectation, there are closed magnetic orbits involving the open- surface Fermi-arcs. Below a critical field strength that depends on sample thickness, these orbits produce periodic quantum oscillations of the density of states in a magnetic field, enabling a variety of experimental probes of the unconventional Fermi-arc surface states. The orbits are also essential for reproducing the bulk chiral anomaly in a finite slab. These results are then extended to the closely related and recently discovered 3 D Dirac SM materials, including Cd 3 As 2 and Na 3 Bi, which are doubled copies of Weyl semi-metals <b>protected</b> by <b>crystal</b> symmetry. Despite {{the fact that the}} <b>protecting</b> <b>crystal</b> symmetry is broken by a surface, we show that Dirac materials can still host unconventional surface-states, which can be detected in quantum oscillations experiments.

40|$|In {{electronic}} topological Dirac semimetals the conduction and {{valence bands}} touch at discrete {{points in the}} Brillouin zone and form Dirac cones.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} predict two new {{classes of}} three-dimensional topological crystalline insulators (TCIs), which have an odd number of unpinned surface Dirac cones <b>protected</b> by <b>crystal</b> symmetries. The first class {{is protected by}} a single glide plane symmetry; the second class is protected by a composition of a twofold rotation and time-reversal symmetry. Both classes of TCIs are characterized by a quantized π Berry phase associated with surface states and a Z_ 2 topological invariant associated with the bulk bands. In the presence of disorder, these TCI surface states are protected against localization by the average crystal symmetries, and exhibit critical conductivity in the universality class of the quantum Hall plateau transition. These new TCIs exist in time-reversal-breaking systems with or without spin-orbital coupling, and their material realizations are discussed. Comment: 4 pages plus supplementary material...|$|R
