50|$|Variable {{universal}} life insurance (often shortened to VUL) {{is a type}} of life insurance that builds a cash value. In a VUL, the cash value can be invested {{in a wide variety of}} separate accounts, similar to mutual funds, and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner. The 'variable' component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock and/or bond markets. The 'universal' component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments. The premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the Internal Revenue Code for life insurance. This flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically cannot be missed without lapsing the policy (although one may exercise an Automatic <b>Premium</b> <b>Loan</b> feature, or surrender dividends to pay a Whole Life premium).|$|E
40|$|AbstractMining of data is an {{important}} increasingly methodology for extracting and finding the meaningful hidden knowledge in huge archives of data. There are the various negative social perceptions related to mining of data, out of which many are potential discrimination and potential privacy invasion. The potential discrimination consists of unfairly treating and identifying people based on their existence and belonging to a particular group. Data mining and automated data collection techniques such as classification and association rule mining have provided way to taking decisions automatically, such as computation of insurance <b>premium,</b> <b>loan</b> granting or denial, credit card issue etc. If the provided data sets for training are biased in discriminatory (sensitive) attributes such as, race, gender, religion, etc., discriminatory decisions can be taken and may ensue. For avoiding this situations, antidiscrimination methodology like discrimination prevention and discovery have been considered in the data mining. There are mainly two types of discrimination, one is direct discrimination and second is indirect discrimination. Direct discrimination exists in the situations when decisions are taken {{on the basis of}} the sensitive attributes. Indirect discrimination exists in the situations when decisions are taken {{on the basis of the}} non-sensitive attributes that are strongly correlated with the biased sensitive attributes...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to show whether Finnish small and {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SME) that are involved in M&A are provided bank financing with different terms than other SMEs. Another aspect is to study the rofitability of these SME M&A customers comparing them to other SME customers. Since an M&A occasion is typically a point of irregularity in the continuum of a firm’s ifecycle, firms might be willing to change their main bank at the same time. Thus, banks could have an incentive to provide financing with more attractive terms to M&A customers due to allure new customers or to maintain the existing ones. The study provides a completely new viewpoint to the field of relationship banking by linking it with small firm M&A. The data set is unique in nature and it is provided by a large retail bank operating in Finland. The data include 563 loan level observations from 305 separate firms during 2007 – 2011. From the total of 563 loan observations, 88 are identified as M&A loans. In these cases the subject bank has provided financing for M&A purposes. Also, the loan price and profitability of the firms that have been granted an M&A loan are examined. Loan price is measured with <b>loan</b> <b>premium</b> and profitability with profit margin. The data are being analyzed using descriptive methods, univariate tests as well as multivariate OLS regressions. The results provide strong indications that SME M&A customers do not obtain financing with better terms than other SME customer nor they are more profitable. I find that the subject bank is following rather strictly its loan granting policies in regard to M&A customers as well as non-M&A customers. M&A customers have to pay higher <b>premium</b> for their <b>loans</b> to compensate the higher risk that is related to discontinuous nature of M&A occasions. However, I find differences in the <b>loan</b> <b>premiums</b> and profitability of M&A firms and non-M&A firms when the duration of the relationship is being controlled. It seems that firms that take loans for M&A purposes benefit more from long lasting bank-firm relationship than non-M&A firms. With regard to existing findings on relationship banking, I find that the longer the duration of the banking relationship, the lower the <b>loan</b> <b>premium</b> on average.

30|$|This study applies Real Options Theory to banking in the {{environment}} of actively traded Philippine Universal Banks. These banks exist {{in an environment of}} imperfect information with regard to lending, and a country where credit scarcity impedes the growth and performance of entrepreneurial activity. We investigate the option <b>premiums</b> of <b>loan</b> portfolios that depict managerial flexibility with investment strategy. A Real Options Model that considers both the strategies to lend and to idle shows that smaller lending institutions will value loans higher than their larger competitors. From the model, the need to maintain smaller variances in loan portfolio returns constrains manager flexibility. Option premiums in the Philippines exhibit sensitivity to information asymmetries. In these findings, this discussion forwards three propositions and their implications. Furthermore, this paper discusses the value of a hedging portfolio to counter risks from information asymmetry. Hence, this paper differs from many models in the existing literature that focus just on the value of the call option, the value of expansion or growth.|$|R

Second, I investigate the effects of ex ante accounting conservatism on loan pricing terms, conditional on the managerial incentive structure. I find that ex ante accounting conservatism decreases loan spreads when managers receive average or below-average equity compensation. However, when managers receive above-average equity compensation, ex ante conservatism leads to banks demanding larger loan spreads as well as fewer and tighter financial covenants. These results provide evidence consistent with banks viewing ex ante conservatism as an instrument for reducing the monitoring value of financial covenants when managers receive aggressive equity compensation...|$|R

40|$|Multi-year {{insurance}} {{has been}} proposed {{as a tool to}} incentivise policy-holders to invest in property-level adaptation. In a world of rising natural catastrophe risks, such autonomous adaptations could have significant benefits for the property owner, the insurer and society.

We conclude that even under conditions of known and stationary risk, initial capital requirements could be around 50 per cent higher for a 10 -year contract than an annual contract and the annual premium around 5. 5 per cent higher; in the real world of changing and uncertain risks, premiums would be even higher. We also conclude that multi-year contracts have several additional disadvantages that are likely to limit their demand and availability in the general retail insurance market.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how banking relationships that combine lending and underwriting services affect {{the terms of}} lending, through both loan supply- and loan demand-side effects, and the underwriting costs of debt and equity issues. We capture and control for firm characteristics, including differences in the sequences of firm financing decisions (which we argue are likely to capture important cross-sectional heterogeneity, and which previously have been ignored in the literature). We construct a structural model of lending, which separately identifies loan supply and loan demand. Our approach results in significant improvement in the explanatory power of our regressions when compared to prior studies. We find no evidence that universal banks under-price loans to win underwriting business. Instead, we find that universal banks charge <b>premiums</b> for <b>loans</b> and underwriting services to extract value from combined lending and underwriting relationships. We also find that universal banks (as opposed to stand alone investment banks) enjoy cost advantages in both lending and underwriting, irrespective of relationship benefits.
