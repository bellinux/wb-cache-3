50|$|The {{dissolution}} {{meant that}} Fitzharris was tried before the king's bench in Easter term, and entered a <b>plea</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> {{of the court}} {{on the ground that}} proceedings were pending against him before the Lords. This plea was ruled to be insufficient, and Fitzharris was proceeded against at common law, 9 June 1681, and convicted. Francis Hawkins, chaplain of the Tower, then took him in hand {{in the interests of the}} court, and, by insinuating that his life might yet be spared, persuaded him to draw up a pretended confession implicating whig leaders, in which William Howard, 3rd Baron Howard of Escrick, who had befriended Fitzharris, was made the author of the libel, while Sir Robert Clayton and Sir George Treby, before whom his preliminary examination had been conducted, together with the sheriffs, Slingsby Bethel and Henry Cornish, were charged with subornation. Gilbert Burnet who interviewed Fitzharris reported later that he knew well he was being led on with false hopes. Fitzharris was executed on 1 July 1681, the concocted confession appeared the very next day, and Hawkins was rewarded with the deanery of Chichester. The justices and sheriffs in their reply, Truth Vindicated, claimed the so-called confession was a tissue of falsehoods. The indictment against Lord Howard of Escrick was withdrawn, since the grand jury refused to believe the witnesses.|$|E

In February 2011, the court ruled that the firm has the standing to challenge the ethics board. In reversing the lower courts, Justice Max Baer said Cozen O'Connor sufficiently pleaded in its declaratory judgment action its own inability to forgive the total debt without violating campaign finance laws.|$|R

Cambridge would do better to stand firm with Harvard and Yale as all-male institutions. The dim echoes of what had once been a white-hot argument found no support, and the discussion was closed.|$|R

All that they now wanted was a lad to carry their travelling bags, who was easily procured from an adjoining cottage; and they prepared to walk forward, when they found there was another passenger in the same deserted situation with themselves. This was the elderly and sickly-looking person, who had been precipitated into the river along with the two young lawyers. He, it seems, had been too modest to push his own <b>plea</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> coachman {{when he saw that}} of his betters rejected, and now remained behind with a look of timid anxiety, plainly intimating that he was deficient in those means of recommendation which are necessary passports to the hospitality of an inn.|$|R

50|$|Modiain (The Grocer's wife) is {{probably}} his shortest novel. In Modiain Koirala {{looks at the}} Mahabharata war {{from the point of}} view of a young woman who loses her husband to the war. This woman was not alone. There were hundreds of thousands of young women who were widowed by the war. Thus, Koirala presents a passionate <b>plea</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita, which assumes that the world is but an illusion and thus makes life and death a meaningless phenomena and that the observance of one's own duty is the ultimate priority. Koirala was against war, and by looking at the Vedanta philosophy and the issue of war from a war widow's point of view, he once again shakes the conscience of the Nepali readers who generally tend to accept the philosophy of Vedanta especially its idea of karma (fate). Characteristically, Koirala presents one more instance in which he analyzes the mind of a woman, as he did in most of his short stories and novels.|$|R

Consistently refused, blacks boycotted in the late 1840s, lowering African School attendance by 65%. In the state legislature, they lobbied a bill outlawing race as a criterion for school admission.

5000|$|Crile {{turned his}} {{willingness}} to question orthodox procedures to breast cancer. The traditional treatment for breast cancer was a radical mastectomy, a procedure which removes the entire breast as well as surrounding muscle, tissue, and lymph nodes. Under the influence of Scottish surgeon Reginald Murley {{as well as one}} of his colleagues at the Cleveland Clinic, he instead began to advocate procedures that removed much less material, a simple mastectomy, which only removes the breast, and a lumpectomy, which removes only a small amount of tissue. Crile performed his final radical mastectomy in 1954 and became a public advocate of alternative procedures, which are now standard. In 1955, he published an article, [...] "A <b>Plea</b> <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> Blind Fear of Cancer", in Life magazine and a book, Cancer and Common Sense. The medical establishment was resistant to the changes he advocated so he sought to influence them through their patients. He was an outspoken critic of traditional procedures for decades and some of his patients, including author Babette Rosmond, became public advocates as well.|$|R

Arundell replied by briefly declaring himself not guilty.|$|R
