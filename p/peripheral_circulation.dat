Twenty-three healthy and untrained female college students volunteered to be subjects in this study. Two groups, one of 15 and one of 8 subjects, were randomly assigned to the experiment and the control groups, respectively. Since the ideal energy consumption for women per day is suggested to be 2, 200 kcal/day, the experiment group was asked to maintain an energy consumption of less than 2, 200 kcal/day during the period of 12 weeks and the control group was asked to maintain the energy consumption more than 2, 200 kcal/day during the same period. An energy consumption level of less than 2, 200 kcal/day was considered to be the lack of exercise in this study.

500|$|The {{combination}} of intracerebral hemorrhage and raised intracranial pressure (if present) {{leads to a}} [...] "sympathetic surge", i.e. over-activation of the sympathetic system. This is thought to occur through two mechanisms, a direct effect on the medulla that leads to activation of the descending sympathetic nervous system and a local release of inflammatory mediators that circulate to the <b>peripheral</b> <b>circulation</b> where they activate the sympathetic system. As {{a consequence of the}} sympathetic surge there is a sudden increase in blood pressure; mediated by increased contractility of the ventricle and increased vasoconstriction leading to increased systemic vascular resistance. The consequences of this sympathetic surge can be sudden, severe, and are frequently life-threatening. The high plasma concentrations of adrenaline also may cause cardiac arrhythmias (irregularities in the heart rate and rhythm), electrocardiographic changes (in 27 percent of cases) and cardiac arrest (in 3 percent of cases) may occur rapidly after the onset of hemorrhage. A further consequence of this process is neurogenic pulmonary edema where a process of increased pressure within the pulmonary circulation causes leaking of fluid from the pulmonary capillaries into the air spaces, the alveoli, of the lung.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Understanding the hemodynamic {{interactions}} of a non-cardiac {{system with the}} main circulatory system is a challenging task in modern medicine. In this study the effect of gastric myoelectric activity (GMA) on peripheral blood volume pulse, acquired by photoplethysmographic (PPG) technique during fasting and postprandial states are analyzed using wavelets. PPG and Electrogastrogram (EGG) signals were acquired simultaneously from 8 healthy volunteers for 30 minutes duration in both states. In this study the power ratio (PR), which is the ratio between powers of the signal in fasting state to the postprandial state, was calculated and it changes significantly. The correlation coefficient was significantly higher (r = 0. 93; P < 0. 05) between PPG PR value and EGG PR value. PR is a good indicator of hemodynamic changes in the main circulatory system caused by stimulation of other subsystem. In future such analysis {{can be used as}} a diagnostic tool for gastric disorders which modulate the <b>peripheral</b> <b>circulations.</b> Index Terms — enteric nervous system, electrogastrography, hemodynamics, wavelet transform, Daubechies wavelet I...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} 50 years {{there have been}} vast {{improvements}} {{in the treatment of}} chronic heart failure (CHF). CHF was initially considered to be a cardio-renal problem- an acute disorder leading to volume expansion and oedema. Diuretics and digitalis were the only available treatments. Subsequently, CHF was considered to bethe result of both myocardial dysfunction and increased tone in the pulmonary and <b>peripheral</b> <b>circulations.</b> The presence of peripheral vasoconstriction suggested that circulatory failure was {{an important component of the}} disease, and vasodilators were added to therapy. In the more recent past, experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that CHF is also characterized by increased neurohormonal ctivation. This has led to the use of angiotensin-converting e zyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and spirouolactone in CHF. Increased neurohormonal ctivity is now recognized as one of the major pathophysiological factors that contribute to the progression of CHF. Activation of neurohormonal mechanisms is only compensatory in the short term; chronic activation produces detrimental changes in the myocardkma, kidneys and peripheral vasculature.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{clinical}} results after stenting in the coronary and <b>peripheral</b> <b>circulations</b> {{are vastly}} different. Possible explanations for this discrepancy include generally {{longer and more}} complex lesions in the periphery, variable vascular responses to injury according to anatomic location, disparate blood flow rates, and impedance in coronary vs skeletal smooth muscle beds, or phenotypic differences in neointimal hyperplasia and remodeling. This study examined the long-term results (6 months) after implantation of phosphorylcholine-coated balloon-expandable stents in a porcine model of experimental in-stent coronary and peripheral arterial restenosis. MethodsForty-eight stainless steel-tantalum-stainless steel composite balloon-expandable stents coated with phosphorylcholine (TriMaxx stent, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill) were implanted in the coronary (3. 0 × 15 mm) or larger femoral arteries (4. 0 × 38 mm) of Yorkshire crossbred swine to achieve a 1. 1 : 1 stent-to-artery ratio. After 28, 90, or 180 days, the arteries were excised, perfusion-fixed at 100 mm Hg, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for morphometric evaluation. ResultsOne animal did not survive to euthanasia; all arteries in surviving animals were patent. No {{significant differences were found}} in mean injury or inflammation scores among the groups or time points. The larger femoral arteries generated more neointimal area over time than the coronary arteries. The neointimal area in coronary arteries was 2. 76 ± 0. 71, 1. 75 ± 0. 42, and 1. 83 ± 0. 19 mm 2 at 28, 90, and 180 days, respectively, and 5. 20 ± 0. 97, 3. 11 ± 0. 53, and 5. 10 ± 0. 80 mm 2 in the femoral arteries (P <. 05 coronary vs femoral at 180 days). This led to statistically significantly increased percent area stenosis at 180 days (coronary 27 % ± 4 % vs femoral 45 % ± 5 %; P <. 05). ConclusionsThe vascular response to balloon-expandable stenting in the coronary and <b>peripheral</b> <b>circulations</b> is different. After 6 months, neointimal hyperplasia and stent-induced stenosis were increased in peripheral porcine arteries compared with coronary arteries.

Although endovascular intervention is highly effective in the coronary and iliac arterial system, it has been shown to be less effective in the infrainguinal circulation.

Measurements of coronary and peripheral vascular function in resistance vessels can be made but rely on invasive procedures, which make them unsuitable for routine application. Aa assessment of the direct correlation between vascular responses in skin and coronary vessels {{has not been made}} previously. In 27 normal, healthy subjects (18 to 55 years old), we examined the relationship between peripheral and coronary vascular function. Cutaneous perfusion was measured using the non-invasive technique of laser Doppler imaging during iontophoresis of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside, and cutaneous vascular conductance was calculated (laser Doppler perfusion/mean arterial pressure). Coronary flow reserve was measured using transthoracic echocardiography during intravenous adenosine infusion. Mean diastolic velocities were measured at baseline and at peak hyperaemic conditions from the Doppler signal recordings. Coronary velocity reserve (CVR) was defined as the ratio of hyperaemic to basal mean diastolic velocities. There were significant positive correlations between coronary velocity reserve and cutaneous vascular conductance for acetylcholine (r= 0. 399, P= 0. 039) and for sodium nitroprusside (r= 0. 446, P= 0. 020).

A Dansk Dopplerfantom and ATS Urethan-based Phantom confirmed the general accuracy of the Acuson 128 /XP 10; flow velocity determinations were more accurate in pulsed Doppler mode than colorflow mode, though it consistently showed speeds some 20 % higher than indicated by the Dopplerfantom. Maximum arterial velocity (Vmax) was higher (p< 0. 001) in malignant (n= 39) than in benign (n= 22) breast tumors. The resistance index (R. I.) of all was generally higher in malignant masses; Vmin/Vmax was not significant. The color signal ratio, the area of the color indicating the blood flow divided by the cross-sectional area of the mass, was higher in malignant masses. Striking correlations were obtained between pathohistologic findings and Doppler data in all types of breast tumors. Scirrhous carcinomas showing abundant color signals invariably contained increased amounts of fresh interstitial elements, suggesting active growth. Tumors with lower intensity color signals or without any color signals had few fresh interstitial elements and only contained proprietary connective tissue. In summary, 2 D color Doppler sonography is a sensitive method for observation of blood flow in tumors. The excellent correlation of computed sonography findings with pathohistologic findings suggest great promise for this method in the differential diagnosis of tumors...|$|R
