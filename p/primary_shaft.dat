40|$|One way {{to predict}} {{and control the}} output torque of a geared neutral CVT {{is to use the}} {{relationship}} between slip in the variator and transmitted belt torque. This relationship {{is often referred to as}} the traction curve. For small slip values, the output torque increases almost linearly with slip. However, at approximately 2 % slip, the maximum output torque is reached. For larger slip values, the output torque shows even a decline. Hence, measuring the traction curve in open loop is not possible. Stability analysis shows that by modifying the plant with a nonlinear feedback control torque depending on the slip, a stable closed loop plant with two new defined inputs is obtained. An open loop input torque at this plant now uniquely defines the slip in the system. The <b>primary</b> <b>shaft</b> angular velocity is controlled using a robust stabilizing controller.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{phenomena}} compromising {{the comfort of the}} passenger vehicles is jerk. Jerk occurs {{as a response to the}} transient in the driver torque demand. The transient provokes torsional oscillation of the drivetrain, which results in oscillations and jerk of the vehicle. These oscillations and jerk are transmitted to the driver and can cause discomfort to the driver and thus affecting the drivability of the vehicle. The aim of this work is to develop an anti-jerk controller to achieve smooth response of the vehicle and enhance the drivability metrics. The drivability analysis in this thesis focused on the longitudinal dynamic response during the tip-in manoeuvre. The anti-jerk controller introduced in this work is an optimisation-based controller. It is developed by using two models, i. e. a linear model and non-linear model. The developed models include detailed description of the drivetrain system such as clutch, <b>primary</b> <b>shaft,</b> secondary shaft, differential, half-shaft, tyres and the vehicle. The engine was modelled using the engine map. To achieve high confidence of the models fidelity, the models were verified by experimental data which ensures that the models are accurate and characterised by the required details. The anti-jerk controller is an optimised controller and uses a gain scheduling where the gain scheduling optimisation was performed off-line to reduce the engineering time in the controller gain tuning. The simulation results of the models with the controller show a significant improvement of the drivability, which is measured by the overshoot and the rise time on the acceleration profile...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{covers the}} design and simulation of a novel experimental concept for multi-axial fatigue analysis of cylindrical specimens. The resulting design allows a combination of bending and torsional stress to test specimens with critical diameters ranging from 5 to 15 mm at test frequencies up to 50 Hz. Furthermore, the amplitude and frequency of both loadcases can be controlled independently. The test rig {{will be used to}} study and validate fatigue criteria for synchronous and asynchronous loading conditions and to analyze the effect of size on the fatigue life of metal and plastic components. The test setup consists of a closed mechanical loop. The <b>primary</b> <b>shaft</b> contains the cylindrical test specimen and is modified to impose rotating bending loads. The secondary shaft is adjusted to introduce fluctuating torque in the transmission loop. Both shafts are connected by means of two double link mechanisms to minimize the clearance and the inertia of the system. The time-varying multi-axial stress state in the cylindrical specimen is analyzed {{as a function of the}} amplitudes and frequencies of both bending and torsional loadcases. This is verified by a numerical fatigue analysis in MSC-Patran and MSC-Fatigue. Finally, the dynamical behavior of the test system is studied using a 5 DOF torsional mass-spring representation and the Lagrangian method. A more complex model with 20 DOF is implemented in SimDriveLine and solved via Matlab to analyze the kinematical and dynamical properties more accurately.
