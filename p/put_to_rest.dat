5|$|Ali {{refused to}} negotiate, gained {{the backing of}} Salibi, and the two {{defeated}} their father, who had since demobilized his troops and was relying on local civilian volunteers from Acre. When Zahir re-mobilized his Maghrebi mercenaries in Acre he launched an offensive and defeated Ali, who subsequently fled Deir Hanna in October. Out of sympathy for Ali's children, who remained in the fortress village, he pardoned Ali on the condition he pay 12,500 piasters and 25 Arabian horses for the fortress. By December 1767, Zahir's intra-family disputes were <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> for several years (until 1774–75), and through the intercession of Uthman, a close and enduring alliance was established between Zahir and Sheikh Nasif.|$|E
5|$|The team {{struggled}} to find an opponent for their final match in Britain. They eventually played Southern Counties, and beat them 3–1. This was their 74th match in the British Isles and their 49th victory. The authorities and press in London continued to view the team negatively, and the Natives boarded ship without a formal farewell. This perceived affront from the RFU provoked some criticism from the press outside London, {{as well as from}} the team manager Scott, who felt that with the team's official apology after the England match, the controversy should have <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alvin Plantinga's {{free will}} defense {{is a logical}} {{argument}} developed by American analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga, the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame, and published in its final version in his 1977 book God, Freedom, and Evil. Plantinga's argument is a defense against the logical problem of evil as formulated by philosopher J. L. Mackie beginning in 1955. Mackie's formulation of the logical problem of evil argued that three attributes of God, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence, in orthodox Christian theism are logically incompatible with the existence of evil. In 1982, Mackie conceded that Plantinga's defense successfully refuted his argument in The Miracle of Theism, {{though he did not}} claim that the problem of evil had been <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2003, a six-foot slab of {{fiberglass}} {{from the}} imitation wax {{at the top}} of the candle was knocked loose by 50 mile-per-hour winds during a storm. Nobody was injured. James Pruznick, a filmmaker from Pohatcong Township, New Jersey, made a documentary film in 2004 focused on that year's assembly of the Peace Candle, as well as interviews with politicians, artists, merchants and construction workers about the history of the structure. It was first screened in December 2004 and made available subsequently on VHS and DVD. In October 2008, fear grew that the Peace Candle would no longer be erected when Easton employees who previously volunteer to climb the Peace Candle structure no longer wished to assemble it. Those fears were <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> the next month, however, when the trade union Lehigh Valley Erectors Inc. volunteered to put the candle up.|$|E

It was subsequently recognized as the Republic of Adygea within the Russian SFSR and retained its status of a republic within the Russian Federation after the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991. Between 2004 and 2006, attempts were made to merge the republic with Krasnodar Krai, but the proposal met with strong resistance from the native Adyghe population and was eventually <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest.</b> The results of a 2011 opinion poll showed that 83% of the population of Adygea and over 90% of the population of Krasnodar Krai regard a potential merger in an unfavorable light.|$|E
