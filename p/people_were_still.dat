5|$|In Haiti, about 630,000 <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> {{living in}} tents across areas {{devastated by the}} January 2010 {{earthquake}} prior to Emily's arrival. Due {{to the lack of}} sturdy structure to ride out a storm, fears arose over how they would fare with a tropical cyclone passing through the country. Emergency officials in the country set aside 22 large buses to evacuate thousands of people at the risk of flooding. Additionally, residents were urged to conserve food and safeguard their belongings. The United Nations placed 11,500 troops in the country on standby to assist in recovery efforts should they be necessitated. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies also put emergency teams on standby to deliver food support in addition to the 125,000 people already assisted. In advance of the storm, authorities closed all airports and landing sites in country.|$|E

25|$|All 30 {{passengers}} (22 Dutch, 6 German, 1 British and 1 Irish) and the 10 crew died.

Those concerns came despite claims that the outbreak had been contained in the north and central parts of the country. The Pan American Health Organisation predicted that 270,000 people would be infected within a year of the outbreak.|$|E
25|$|As of February 2006, {{more than}} a year after the tsunami, a large number of <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> living in barrack-style {{temporary}} living centers (TLC) or tents. Reconstruction was visible everywhere, but due to the sheer scale of the disaster, and logistic difficulties, progress was slow. A study in 2007 estimates 83.6% of the population has psychiatric illness, while 69.8% suffers from severe emotional distress.|$|E

25|$|The {{day after}} the storming, bulldozers {{gathered}} the debris of the building, including the body parts of the victims, and removed it to a garbage dump. The first of the many funerals were conducted on 4 September, the {{day after the}} final assault, with more following soon after, including mass burials of 120 people. The local cemetery was too small and had to be expanded to an adjacent plot of land to accommodate the dead. Three days after the siege, 180 <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> missing. Many survivors remained severely traumatized and at least one female former hostage committed suicide after returning home.|$|E

Total expenditure on the zoo amounted to £53,818. Mortality rates were still high and staff were {{struggling with a}} plague of rats but there was positive news as well. Some of the zoo's most popular enclosures were completed and <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> keen to donate animals. Perhaps most encouraging was that 25 mammals and 62 birds were born at the zoo in 1928.

25|$|Despite {{the almost}} {{universal}} assumption to the contrary, the wastewater treatment facilities installed in December 1959 {{had no effect}} on the level of organic mercury being released into the Shiranui Sea. The pollution and the disease it caused continued to spread. The Kumamoto and Kagoshima prefectural governments conducted a joint survey in late 1960 and early 1961 into the level of mercury in the hair of people living around the Shiranui Sea. The results confirmed that organic mercury had spread all around the inland sea and that <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> being poisoned by contaminated fish. Hundreds of people were discovered to have levels greater than 50 ppm of mercury in their hair, the level at which people are likely to experience nerve damage. The highest result recorded was that of a woman from Goshonoura island who had 920 ppm in her sample.|$|E
25|$|Wat Phra Dhammakaya {{replied to}} {{the critics of}} the Cetiya {{building}} project that the building had begun before the crisis, when the economy was still booming; therefore, the timing was not wrong. The temple also raised examples of other important Thai building projects that had been realized during crises. Finally, the temple posed the question: if, despite the crisis, <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> buying alcohol and cigarettes and still going to the movies, then {{what was wrong with}} donating for a religious building? The temple also responded to its critics about the accusations of wealth, stating that the temple's wealth was used for the laypeople and Buddhist education, not for other purposes. Building large buildings benefited Buddhism as a whole, not just the temple, because it helped strengthen the religion. Apart from donating to hospitals or schools, financially supporting Buddhism should also be done, because it would help foster ethics in society.|$|E
25|$|The main {{group of}} HOS troops and Croat civilians reached the Bleiburg field on 15 May. They were {{the head of}} the 45-65 {{kilometres}} long columns, numbering around 25,000 to 30,000 people. The group included various branches of the NDH army, including the Air Force, Croatian Home Guard and Ustaše Militia, and civilian refugees. Most of them camped near the local railroad embankment. The Montenegrin National Army was placed east of the embankment. Around 175,000 <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> on Yugoslav territory and moving towards Bleiburg. Negotiations between representatives of the HOS, the Yugoslav Army and the British were held on the same day in the Bleiburg Castle. The British negotiator was Brigadier Patrick T. D. Scott of the 38th (Irish) Infantry Brigade. Ustaša infantry general Ivo Herenčić of the V Ustaša Corps, and a translator, Colonel Danijel Crljen, were involved in the surrender negotiations.|$|E

25|$|By 1930, about 44,500 {{people lived}} in Jackson heights, an {{increase}} from 3,800 residents in 1910. The community was close-knit. Gay people from Broadway theaters started {{to move into the}} area. However, Jewish and black <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> excluded until Jews were allowed to move in by the 1940s and blacks by 1968. Beginning in the 1960s, an influx of newly immigrated residents came into Jackson Heights, {{at the same time that}} existing residents were leaving for suburbs due to white flight. Hispanic immigrants moved in by the 1970s. By then, white residents who remained in the neighborhood wished to eliminate the stigma of Jackson Heights being an ethnically diverse neighborhood, often defining its border as Roosevelt Avenue, because crime had started to increase in the area. By the mid-1970s, South American organized crime groups in Jackson Heights, often peddling drugs, gained national attention. A 1978 article in New York Magazine stated that 27 people were killed in Jackson Heights in the three years preceding.|$|E

By June, Milošević agreed to a foreign military presence in Kosovo and the withdrawal of his troops. After the Yugoslav Army withdrew, over half of Kosovo's Serbs and other non-Albanians flew or were expelled and many of the remaining civilians were subjected to abuse. During the Kosovo War, over 90,000 Serbian and other non-Albanian refugees fled the war-torn province. In the days after the Yugoslav Army withdrew, over 200,000 (over half) Serb and other non-Albanians civilians were expelled from Kosovo and many of the remaining civilians were victims of abuse. After Kosovo and other Yugoslav Wars, Serbia became home to the highest number of refugees and IDPs (including Kosovo Serbs) in Europe.|$|E
