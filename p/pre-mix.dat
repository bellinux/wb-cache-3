40|$|Abstract. This paper {{conducts a}} study on a <b>pre-mixed</b> micro {{abrasive}} water jet machining system. A new kind of abrasive mixing tank and the jet system are designed and tapped for the <b>pre-mixed</b> micro abrasive water jet machining system. The performances of the <b>pre-mixed</b> micro AWJ machining system are tested, and some polishing experiments are conducted for hard-brittle materials such as silicon nitride. The results show the feasibility and {{the advantage of the}} <b>pre-mixed</b> micro abrasive water jet machining system for polishing hard-brittle materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} temperature, {{duration}} {{and speed of}} <b>pre-mixing</b> on the dispersion of organoclay in epoxy was studied. The technique of high-speed mixing process was used. Epoxy and Cloisite 30 B were <b>pre-mixed</b> at different temperatures, different speeds and for different durations of time. The quality of dispersion and intercalation/exfoliation of organoclay in epoxy after <b>pre-mixing</b> (before adding hardener) was analyzed by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and viscosity measurement. The dispersion and intercalation/exfoliation of organoclay in the epoxy nanocomposites (ENCs) after curing were characterized by XRD, field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEGSEM) and TEM. The results illustrate that the clay particles were broken down to smaller and smaller sizes with increase of <b>pre-mixing</b> temperature and especially with increase in <b>pre-mixing</b> speed. These parameters do not significantly affect the intercalation/ exfoliation of organoclay in epoxy at the <b>pre-mixing</b> step, but they have indirect effect on intercalation/ exfoliation at the curing step.

2500|$|Aqueous {{film-forming}} foam (AFFF), used on A and B {{fires and}} for vapor suppression. The {{most common type}} in portable foam extinguishers. [...] AFFF {{was developed in the}} 1960s under Project Light Water in a joint venture between 3M and the U.S. Navy. AFFF forms a film that floats out before the foam blanket, sealing the surface and smothering the fire by excluding oxygen. AFFF is widely used for ARFF firefighting at airports, often as a twin agent unit (TAU) with purple-K dry chemical.It contains fluoro-tensides [...] which can be accumulated in the human body. The long-term effects of this on the human body and environment are unclear at this time. AFFF can be discharged through an air-aspirating branchpipe nozzle or a spray nozzle, and is now produced only in <b>pre-mix</b> form, where the foam concentrate is stored mixed with water. In the past, as solid charge model was produced, where the AFFF concentrate was housed as a dry compound in an external, disposable cartridge in a specially designed nozzle. The extinguisher body was charged with plain water, and the discharge pressure mixed the foam concentrate with the water upon squeezing the lever. These extinguishers received double the rating of a <b>pre-mix</b> model (40-B instead of 20-B), but are now considered obsolete, as parts and refill cartridges have been discontinued by the manufacturer.|$|E
2500|$|By 1963 Yamaha's {{dedication}} {{to both the}} two-stroke engine and racing paid off with their first victory in international competition, at the Belgium GP, where they won the 250cc class. [...] Success in sales was even more impressive, and Yamaha set up {{the first of its}} international subsidiaries in this period beginning with Thailand in 1964, and the Netherlands in 1968. [...] 1965 saw the release of a 305cc two-stroke twin, the flagship of the company's lineup. [...] It featured a separate oil supply which directly injected oil into the gasoline prior to combustion (traditionally riders had to <b>pre-mix</b> oil into gasoline together before filling the gas tank on two stroke engines). [...] In 1967 a new larger displacement model was added to the range, the 350cc two stroke twin R-1.|$|E

50|$|This {{system is}} {{commonly}} used for motorcycles as it eliminates the need of <b>pre-mixing</b> fuel and two-stroke oil. Vespa Sprint is an example where <b>pre-mixing</b> of two-stroke oil is required. Automatic lubrication was introduced for motorcycles by Velocette in 1913.|$|R

5000|$|Plaster {{spraying}} {{allows a}} plasterer to skim a drywall {{more than five}} times faster than using a hand float to apply it. Although classic gypsum-based plaster can be sprayed if it is [...] "spray grade," [...] most plaster sprayers prefer the organic-based <b>pre-mixed</b> plaster packaged in a plastic bag because the plaster spraying machine {{does not need to be}} cleaned out after the job is finished, providing that plaster is kept moist. The <b>pre-mixed</b> plaster also has the advantage that any surplus can be recycled, almost eliminating waste, and plasterers do not need to haul water and mix the plaster from powder. A drywall skimmed with <b>pre-mixed</b> plaster can be painted in less than 24 hours, depending on the ambient temperature and humidity.|$|R
