5|$|The {{casualties}} at Fort Donelson were heavy, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large Confederate surrender. Union {{losses were}} 2,691 (507 killed, 1,976 wounded, 208 captured/missing), Confederate 13,846 (327 killed, 1,127 wounded, 12,392 captured/missing).|$|E
5|$|After their 1908–12 trip, {{the couple}} stopped {{exploring}} {{and turned to}} writing and lecturing, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> onset of World War I in 1914. Fanny Workman became the first American woman to lecture at the Sorbonne in Paris. She {{was also one of}} the first women admitted as a member of the Royal Geographical Society, a distinction she earned because her publications included scientific reflections on glaciation and other phenomena. She also earned medals of honor from 10 European geographical societies and was eventually elected a member of the American Alpine Club, Royal Asiatic Society, Club Alpino Italiano, Deutscher und Österreichischer Alpenverein, and Club alpin français. She was very proud of these achievements, listing them on the title pages of her books.|$|E
5|$|Trillium grandiflorum {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular trilliums in cultivation, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> size of its flowers and its {{relative}} ease of cultivation. Although not particularly demanding, its cultivation is a slow and rather uncertain process, due to usually slow growth, wide variations in growth speed and sometimes capricious germination rates. As a result, the vast majority of plants and rhizomes in commerce are collected in the wild, and such heavy collecting, combined with other pressures such as habitat destruction and grazing, may effectively endanger the plants in some areas. This also creates tensions between Trillium enthusiasts and conservation proponents. Transplantation (as with almost all non-weedy wild plants) is a delicate process, and in many cases results in the death of the plant. In cultivation, T. grandiflorum may flower in as little as 4 to 5 years after germination (compared to the usual 7 to 10 in the wild), but these cases appear to be exceptions rather than the rule. One study revealed 20 or so individuals performing so well out of about 10,000 seeds planted, only 20% of which germinated after a year. However, barring plant destruction, T. grandiflorum can continue flowering every year after it has begun.|$|E

50|$|Pachaug State Forest was {{the first}} state forest in Connecticut and grew quickly in acreage <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> farmers and landholders in the area {{realized}} that their soil was poor for farming and sold their land to {{the state in the}} 1920s and 1930s.|$|R

If motion picture negative is run through a standard C-41 color film developer bath, the rem-jet backing partially dissolves and destroys the integrity of the developer and, potentially, ruins the film.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the South Carolina campaign, most pundits had {{predicted}} Barack Obama the winner, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state's large African-American population. For this reason, Obama {{was shown to}} be significantly ahead of his two rivals, John Edwards, who carried the state in 2004, and Hillary Clinton, whose husband was popular in the African-American community.

25|$|In early 1776, the Congress {{sent him}} on a three-man {{diplomatic}} mission to Canada, in order to seek assistance from French Canadians in the confrontation with Britain. Carroll was an excellent choice for such a mission, being fluent in French and a Roman Catholic, and therefore well suited to negotiations with the French-speaking Catholics of Quebec. He was joined in the commission by Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Chase and his cousin John Carroll. The commission did not accomplish its mission, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> failure of the concurrent Invasion of Canada.|$|E

25|$|Although {{punk rock}} has {{strong ties to}} anarchism and Marxism, Christian Punks are not a {{subculture}} of Marxism or a form of anarchy or communism, instead, it is a subculture with both Christian and Punk affiliations. This belief was often held by extreme conservatives during the 1970s and 1980s, however, this was <b>primarily</b> used <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clash between the King-James-Only Movement and the Jesus Movement. Evangelists such as Jimmy Swaggart associated the Jesus Movement and Christian rock in general as anti-Christian.|$|R
50|$|In 1900, five {{of seven}} {{clothing}} merchants in Clarksburg, West Virginia, were Jewish, {{and into the}} 1930s the Jews here were <b>primarily</b> merchants. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need to expand their synagogue, the Orthodox Jewish congregation merged with a smaller Reform group to form a compromise Conservative congregation in 1939, and Jewish community life in Clarksburg centered on this synagogue. The community, which reached a population peak of about three hundred in the mid-1950s, is still represented by about thirty families.|$|R
25|$|The period {{following}} World War II was {{notable for}} {{the transformation of}} the city's economy. While jute still employed one-fifth of the working population, new industries were attracted and encouraged. NCR Corporation selected Dundee as the base of operations for the UK in late 1945, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lack of damage the city had sustained in the war, good transport links and high productivity from long hours of sunshine. Production started in the year before the official opening of the plant on 11 June 1947. A fortnight after the 10th anniversary of the plant the 250,000th cash register was produced.|$|E
25|$|Any albedo {{in visible}} light falls within a range of about 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances.

When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas {{have some of the}} highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4. The average albedo of Earth is about 0.3. This is far higher than for the ocean <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contribution of clouds.|$|E

50|$|In {{the various}} {{attempts}} since, members found {{the process to}} be too cumbersome and a potential threat to tribal self-determination, as the constitution {{was supposed to be}} reviewed and approved by BIA. The earliest efforts were rejected <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> segments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tribe did not find enough freedom in <b>the</b> proposed forms <b>of</b> government. In 1935 they feared that the proposed government would hinder development and recovery of their livestock industries; in 1953 they worried about restrictions on development of mineral resources.|$|R
5|$|The season {{produced}} 16tropical depressions, {{of which}} 14 intensified into tropical storms, 8became hurricanes, and 1became a major hurricane. Although the season had <b>the</b> highest number <b>of</b> named storms at the time, it featured only two notable storms, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tropical cyclones remained either weak or at sea. The two most significant storms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season, {{in terms of}} damage and loss of life, were Hurricane Diana and Tropical Storm Marco. However, the strongest tropical cyclone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season was Hurricane Gustav.|$|R
25|$|The game's {{environment}} {{takes up}} 60–65% of the CPU bandwidth, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moving camera, {{but also because}} eight different characters can appear on screen {{at any one time}} – a large number for the technology of the time. Because of this, a powerful CPU was required to run the game, since the engine relied on the processor doing all the work in creating the 3D models. However, despite this limitation, the game runs at a minimum of 15 FPS, even on slow systems. The downside to this was that, since processor power at that time was limited, the in-game 3D models tended to look very pixelated, especially up-close and when motionless, due to the low amount of voxels used to display them. However, had the number of voxels been raised to increase the detail on the characters, the game would have become too slow to play, even on advanced CPUs.|$|E
25|$|The {{island state}} of Aegina was mainly {{active in the}} trade with Egypt, where its major {{competitor}} was Samos. Samos was allied with Chalcis, which suggests that Aegina took the side of Eretria. Corinth and Megara were at war for practically all of the Archaic period, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Corinthian conquest of the Perachora peninsula which had originally belonged to Megara. The actions of Chalcis and Corinth {{in the context of}} western colonisation suggest that the two cities were allied, or at least friendly; Chalcis had prevented Megarian settlers from establishing themselves at Leontinoi, while Corinth had driven Eretrian settlers from Kerkyra. In analogy, a friendship between Megara and Eretria is assumed. Herodotus reports that Chios supported Miletus in the Ionian Revolt, because Miletus had previously assisted the Chiotes against Erythrai. Thus, based on the allegiance of Miletus, an alliance between Chios and Eretria, as well as one between Erythrai and Chalcis can be suggested.|$|E
25|$|In {{the latter}} part of May, 1902, Gruev was {{condemned}} to banishment in the prison of Podrum Kale in Anatolia. There he found Hristo Matov and Hristo Tatarchev, both sentenced to exile in January 1901. Gruev and his comrades were kept in Podroum Kale for ten months. Although he was away from Macedonia and Thrace itself, Gruev managed to keep himself informed as to the development and affairs of the IMARO. He kept up a steady stream of encrypted correspondence with Thessaloniki, Bitola, and Sofia. On Easter of 1903, at the instance of a general amnesty, he was released. Gruev hastened to Thessaloniki and there he found that the Central Committee, which {{was in charge of the}} IMARO, had already resolved to declare a general insurrection which was to take place during 1903. Although Gruev was not in accord with the Central Committee's decision, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SMARO's lack of preparedness, he gave in to the decision of the central Committee.|$|E

Ramsey praised the visuals and the audio, saying both contributed to the game's [...] "shadowy and secretive feelings". His one significant criticism was that dialogue was difficult to hear, with no option to display text for it. Regarding the game's audio aspect, Broady said, [...] "The soundtrack is less impressive, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> overuse: <b>The</b> background effects drone on mercilessly, and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's narratives (which are universally well-written and finely acted) must be listened to over and over again." ...|$|R
