5000|$|As was {{customary}} at the time, {{a number}} of non-points exhibition races {{took place at the}} Speedway in July, August, and September 1941. These races were usually put on to entertain visiting conventioneers. On September 9, 1941, an exhibition [...] "match race" [...] was held at the Speedway to entertain delegates attending the National Association of <b>Postal</b> <b>Supervisors</b> convention. Five drivers - Duke Nalon, Cliff Bergere, Russ Snowberger, Chet Miller, and George Connor - ran two short races. Nalon won the first, a 10-mile race, and Bergere won the second, a 15-mile race. It would be the last event held at the Speedway before the war intervened.|$|R

5000|$|Owney was an {{abandoned}} puppy adopted in 1888 by {{a post office}} worker named Owen, {{who worked at the}} Albany post office. Seeking shelter on a rainy night, the young mutt wandered into {{the back door of the}} post office, which had been accidentally left ajar. The pup seemed to love the smell of the mail bags and soon made one his bed. When the supervisor inquired about the dog that the Albany postal workers were keeping in the back room they said it was Owen's dog. Succumbing to the pup's likable demeanor and the persuasion of the <b>postal</b> workers, the <b>supervisor</b> let them keep the mutt, even though it was against the post office rules. From then on Owen's mutt was known as [...] "Owney".|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In fiscal year 2000, U. S. Postal Service employees accounted for about one-third of both the federal civilian workforce and the $ 2. 1 billion cost of the Federal Workers' Compensation Program (WCP). During that same year, Postal Service employees submitted 85, 000 claims, or one-half of all claims for new work-related injuries, to the Department of Labor's (DOL) Office of Workers' Compensation Program (OWCP), which is charged with administering the program. Because of complaints the subcommittee received from injured federal employees about the untimely receipt of WCP benefits and because Postal Service employees account for such {{a large portion of}} the WCP, the Chairman, House Subcommittee on Government Efficiency, Financial Management, and Intergovernmental Relations, Committee on Government Reform, asked us to determine specifically whether Postal Service employees were receiving WCP benefits in a timely manner. For our current review, we agreed to (1) determine the extent to which Postal Service employees provided all of the evidence required by OWCP regulations for determining the claimants' eligibility for WCP benefits and (2) determine whether claims for WCP eligibility and WCP compensation payments for lost wages or schedule awards were submitted and processed within the time frames set forth in OWCP regulations or performance standards. On the basis of our analysis, we estimate that in about 99 percent of the cases involving Postal Service employees who (1) had work-related injuries during the 12 -month period beginning July 1, 1997, and (2) filed claims for WCP benefits for lost wages or schedule awards due to these injuries, the employees eventually provided OWCP the evidence it required to make a determination on their eligibility for benefits. However, in about 69 percent of the cases, OWCP claims examiners had to request additional information because all of the required evidence needed to make a determination of WCP eligibility was not provided initially. As a result, claims for WCP eligibility were not always processed within the time frames set forth by OWCP. For those Postal Service employees in our sample cases who were determined to be eligible for WCP benefits and later filed claims for compensation for lost wages or schedule awards, we could not reliably estimate the percentage of claims for compensation that were processed within the time frames set forth by OWCP. This was because the dates we needed to "mark" the beginning and ending actions taken by the injured Postal Service employee and <b>Postal</b> Service <b>supervisor</b> to complete, submit, and forward claims to DWCP were missing from the claim forms. ...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{dispatch}} {{was sent}} by Depew from the General Post Office to the Produce Exchange Post Office and included a bible wrapped in an American flag, {{a copy of the}} Constitution, a copy of President William McKinley's inaugural speech and several other papers. The bible was included in order to reference Job 9:25, [...] "Now my days are swifter than a post" [...] (KJV). [...] The return delivery contained a bouquet of violets and, as reported the following day in the New York Times, the round trip took less than three minutes, most of which was taken in unloading and reloading the canister at the other end. Subsequent deliveries included a variety of amusing items including a large artificial peach (a reference to Depew's nickname), clothing, a candlestick and a live cat.

5000|$|Letter {{carriers}} are paid hourly {{with the potential}} for overtime. Letter Carriers are also subject to [...] "pivoting" [...] on a daily basis. Pivoting (when a carrier's assigned route will take less than 8 hours to complete, management may [...] "pivot" [...] said carrier to work on another route to fill that carrier up to 8 hours.) is a tool postal management uses to redistribute and eliminate overtime costs, based on consultation with the Carrier about his/her estimated workload for the day and mail volume projections from the DOIS (Delivery Operations Information System) computer program. Routes are adjusted and/ or eliminated based on information (length, time, and overall workload) also controlled by this program, consultations with the carrier assigned to the route, and a current PS Form 3999 (street observation by a <b>postal</b> <b>supervisor</b> to determine accurate times spent on actual delivery of mail). Many carriers object to the fact that average mail volumes used for route adjustments come from DOIS as it is not an actual count of the mail by a person and instead by a machine, leading carriers to question the accuracy of the count.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the face}} of the {{continuing}} silence of [...] "the professionals", a number of laypeople with religious interests, such as the religious author Andreas Daniel Pedrin (1823-1891) and the <b>postal</b> <b>supervisor</b> and author Jørgen Christian Theodor Faber (1824-1886), felt called to take a public stand against Eiríksson’s views. In Denmark, on the whole, Eiríksson’s late writings provoked a wide spectrum of reactions. These ranged in tone from radical rejection at one extreme, to open professions of sympathy for Eiríksson and his message at the other end. In his native Iceland, however, Eiríksson’s reception was almost uniformly harsh. There his much-discussed book The Gospel of John (1863) sparked fierce controversy: not only theologians like Sigurður Melsteð (1819-1895), but also the Catholic priests Jean-Baptiste Baudoin (1831-1875) and Bernard Bernard (1821-1895) felt compelled to take a stand against him. In Sweden, by contrast, Eiríksson’s thought found more fertile soil—thanks above all to the [...] "freethinking pastor" [...] Nils Johan Ekdahl (1799-1870), who translated two of Eiríksson’s books into Swedish. It is not by chance that, in 1877, Eiríksson’s final publications appeared in Swedish newspapers and periodicals-most prominently in the journal Sanningssökaren Truth-Seeker".|$|E
