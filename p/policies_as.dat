40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the possibility of}} using fiscal rather than monetary <b>policy</b> <b>as</b> the instrument of stabilization policy in a new consensus framework. Describing the conduct of fiscal policy in terms of a 'pseudo Taylor rule', it is shown that fiscal <b>policy</b> is <b>as,</b> if not more, effective than monetary <b>policy</b> <b>as</b> a tool for macroeconomic stabilization. The conclusion reached is that the comparative neglect of fiscal <b>policy</b> <b>as</b> an instrument of stabilization policy in new consensus macroeconomics is unwarranted. ...|$|R

5|$|After Leonid Brezhnev assumed {{power in}} 1964, much of Khrushchev's reforms were reversed. The Brezhnev era began {{a new state}} of stagnation, and saw a decline in both the quality and {{quantity}} of products in the Soviet Union. Armenia was severely affected by these <b>policies,</b> <b>as</b> was to be demonstrated several years later in the catastrophic earthquake that hit Spitak. Material allocated to the building of new homes, such as cement and concrete, was diverted for other uses. Bribery and a lack of oversight saw the construction of shoddily built and weakly supported apartment buildings. When the earthquake hit on the morning of December 7, 1988, the houses and apartments least able to resist collapse were those built during the Brezhnev years. Ironically, the older the dwellings, the better they withstood the quake.|$|E
5|$|Harald's reign {{was marked}} by his {{background}} as a military commander, as he often solved disputes with harsh force. One of his skalds even boasted about how Harald broke settlements he had made, in his battles in the Mediterranean. While the sagas largely focus on Harald's war with Sweyn and the invasion of England, little is said about his domestic policies. Modern historians have taken this as a sign that, despite his absolutism, his reign was one of peace and progress for Norway. Harald is considered to have instituted good economic <b>policies,</b> <b>as</b> he developed a Norwegian currency and a viable coin economy, which in turn allowed Norway to participate in international trade. He initiated trade with Kievan Rus' and the Byzantine Empire through his connections, {{as well as with}} Scotland and Ireland. According to the later sagas, Harald founded Oslo, where he spent much time.|$|E

5|$|In 1918, Chamberlain {{was elected}} to the House of Commons, at age 49 the oldest man to enter Parliament and later become Prime Minister. After four years on the backbenches, Chamberlain saw rapid promotion, briefly {{becoming}} Chancellor of the Exchequer after less than a year as a minister. Chamberlain subsequently spent five years as Minister of Health, securing the passage of many reforming acts. After two years in opposition, Chamberlain became part of Ramsay MacDonald's National Government, and spent {{five and a half years}} as Chancellor, directing Britain's financial <b>policies</b> <b>as</b> the nation emerged from the Depression.

5|$|In 371, the Emperor Valens split Cappadocia {{into two}} new provinces, Cappadocia Prima and Cappadocia Secunda.

His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots, or otherwise criticised for its handling of it, although a court found no evidence to prosecute Modi.

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Metternich’s {{diplomacy}} and statesmanship {{became the focus}} of praise in the twentieth century from more favourably inclined historians, particularly biographer Heinrich von Srbik. For example, particularly after WWII, historians were more likely to defend Metternich’s <b>policies</b> <b>as</b> reasonable attempts to achieve his goals, chiefly {{the balance of power in}} Europe. Sympathetic historians point out that Metternich correctly foresaw and worked to prevent Russian dominance in Europe, succeeding where his successors would fail 130 years later. As argued by Srbik, Metternich himself pursued legality, cooperation, and dialogue, and therefore helped ensure thirty years of peace, the “Age of Metternich”. Authors like Peter Viereck and Ernst B. Haas also give Metternich credit for his more liberal ideals, even if they weighed relatively little in his overall policies.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland's {{trade was}} {{blockaded}} {{by both the}} Allies and by the Axis.

Concessions reached a peak after a crucial rail link through Vichy France was severed in 1942, leaving Switzerland completely surrounded, with the exception of Liechtenstein, by the Axis. Over the course of the war, Switzerland interned over 300,000 refugees and the International Red Cross, based in Geneva, played an important part during the conflict.

5|$|The Germans {{generally}} saw the Knights as heroic {{and noble}} men who brought Christianity and civilization to the east. In August 1914, during World War I, Germany won a battle against Russia near the site. When the Germans realized its propaganda potential, they named the battle the Battle of Tannenberg, despite it having actually taken place {{much closer to}} Allenstein (Olsztyn), and framed it as revenge for the Polish–Lithuanian victory 504 years earlier. Nazi Germany later exploited the sentiment by portraying their Lebensraum <b>policies</b> <b>as</b> {{a continuation of the}} Knights' historical mission.|$|E
5|$|Well {{established}} in the imperial capital, Honório Hermeto campaigned in 1829 to become a general deputy (member of the Chamber of Deputies, the national lower house) as a representative for his native Minas Gerais. He was elected to {{a seat in the}} legislature for the term beginning April 1830. He {{became a member of the}} Liberal Party, which stood in opposition to PedroI and his <b>policies.</b> <b>As</b> a general deputy, Honório Hermeto had an unobtrusive role for the first couple of years, having been overshadowed by Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, the leader of the deputies representing Minas Gerais. Short, slim and with a speech impediment, the dark-haired Honório Hermeto appeared an unimpressive figure at first glance. Like his father, he was headstrong, opinionated and often scathing. However, he had self-confidence and a powerful charisma, and was energetic, intelligent, perspicacious and a natural born leader.|$|E
5|$|A key {{criticism}} of the Act {{at the time as}} well as more recently is that the NIRA endorsed monopolies, with the attendant economic problems associated with that type of market failure. Even the National Recovery Review Board, established by President Roosevelt in March 1934 to review the performance of the NRA, concluded that the Act hindered economic growth by promoting cartels and monopolies. One of the economic effects of monopoly and cartels is higher prices—this was seen as necessary because the severe deflation of 1929–33 had depressed prices 20% and more. There is anecdotal evidence that these higher prices led to some stability in industry, but a number of scholars maintain that these prices were so high that economic recovery was inhibited. But other economists disagree, pointing to far more important monetary, budgetary, and tax <b>policies</b> <b>as</b> contributors to the continuation of the Great Depression. Others point out that the cartels created by the Act were inherently unstable (as all cartels are), and that the effect on prices was minimal because the codes collapsed so quickly.|$|E
40|$|Political-economic {{classics}} {{of different}} schools agreed that capitalism inherently and inevitably {{leads to a}} decline of market principles. Analyzing indicators of liberalization policies for 21 OECD-countries in five economic and social policy fields, we demonstrate that Western industrialized countries are subject to a convergent trend towards market-creating policies. This stands {{in stark contrast to}} the theoretical expectations of classical works in the field of political economy. Since the first half of the 1980 s at the latest, Western democracies have entered a new phase of economic liberalization. From a methodological perspective, our findings suggest that the methods for the causal analysis of convergent liberalization policies cannot be identical with the methods that have been used for analyzing the development and consolidation of the varieties of capitalism in the postwar era. 1 Introduction 2 The research question: Liberalization <b>policy</b> <b>as</b> a convergent phenomenon? 3 Liberalization <b>policy</b> <b>as</b> a theoretical surprise 4 Liberalization policy in five spheres of economic and social policy 4. 1 Liberalization <b>policy</b> <b>as</b> transformation of public service sectors 4. 2 Liberalization policy through reduction of subsidies and privatizations 4. 3 Liberalization <b>policy</b> <b>as</b> recommodification of labor power 4. 4 Liberalization <b>policy</b> <b>as</b> market-creation in the fields of pension and health care 4. 5 Liberalization <b>policy</b> <b>as</b> market-creation in the field of capital relations 5 Descriptive analysis 6 Discussion and outlook 7 Literatur...|$|R

5|$|After the Huế Phật Đản shootings on May 8, {{civil unrest}} {{broke out in}} South Vietnam. Nine Buddhists were shot by the Roman Catholic regime of President Ngô Đình Diệm after defying a {{government}} ban on the flying of Buddhist flags on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha and marching in an anti-government protest. Following the shootings, Buddhist leaders began to lobby Diệm for religious equality and compensation and justice {{for the families of}} the victims. With Diệm remaining recalcitrant, the protests escalated. The self-immolation of Buddhist monk Thích Quảng Đức at a busy Saigon intersection became a public relations disaster for the Diệm regime, as photos of the event made front-page headlines worldwide and became a symbol of Diệm's <b>policies.</b> <b>As</b> protests continued, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Special Forces loyal to Diệm's brother Ngô Đình Nhu conducted the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids on August 21, leaving a death toll estimated to be up to several hundred and causing extensive damage under the declaration of martial law. Universities and high schools were closed amid mass pro-Buddhist protests. In the meantime, the fight against the Viet Cong insurgency had begun to lose intensity amid rumours of sectarian infighting amongst ARVN troops. This was compounded by the plotting of a coup by various ARVN officers, which distracted attention from the insurgency. After the pagoda raids, the Kennedy administration sent Cable 243 to the US Embassy, Saigon, ordering an exploration of alternative leadership possibilities.|$|E
5|$|During the West Virginia Democratic Party Senatorial Convention held at Moorefield in August 1886, White {{proposed}} and advocated the first tariff reform and anti-monopoly resolutions ever passed and {{adopted by a}} West Virginia Democratic Party Convention. Prior to its passage at the convention, White's proposal received strong opposition. Tariff reform and anti-monopoly resolutions similar to White's proposal were adopted by the national Democratic Party {{as part of its}} 1888 platform. White had been among the first Democratic Party members in Hampshire County to openly declare his opposition to the fiscal policies of the administration of United States President Grover Cleveland. Under White's leadership, Hampshire County's Democratic delegation was the first Democratic county organization in West Virginia to hold public meetings in opposition to Cleveland's fiscal <b>policies.</b> <b>As</b> the county executive committee chairman, White was the first Democrat in Hampshire County to deliver a public speech denouncing these policies.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, a new keg policy {{was put into}} effect that {{requires}} all student groups to purchase kegs through Duke Dining Services. According to administrators, the rule change {{was intended as a}} way to ensure compliance with alcohol consumption laws as well as to increase on-campus safety. Some students saw the administration's increasingly strict <b>policies</b> <b>as</b> an attempt to alter social life at Duke. As a result, off-campus parties at rented houses became more frequent in subsequent years as a way to avoid Duke policies. Many of these houses were situated in the midst of family neighborhoods, prompting residents to complain about excessive noise and other violations. Police have responded by breaking up parties at several houses, handing out citations, and occasionally arresting party-goers. In the mid-to-late 2000s (decade), the administration made a concerted effort to help students re-establish a robust, on-campus social life and has worked with numerous student groups, especially the Duke University Union, to feature a wide array of events and activities. In March 2006, the university purchased 15 houses in the Trinity Park area that Duke students had typically rented and subsequently sold them to individual families in an effort to encourage renovations to the properties and to reduce off-campus partying in the midst of residential neighborhoods.|$|E
