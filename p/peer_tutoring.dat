Among his colleagues was a female student, Smărăndița popii (known later as Smaranda Posea), for whom he developed an affection which lasted into his adult life, over decades in which the two no longer saw each other. He was taught reading and writing in Cyrillic alphabet through <b>peer</b> <b>tutoring</b> techniques, before the overseeing teacher, , was lassoed off the street and conscripted by the Moldavian military at some point before 1848. After another teacher, whom the Memories portray as a drunk, died from cholera in late 1848, David Creangă withdrew his grandson from the local school and took him to a similar establishment in Broșteni, handing him into the care of a middle-aged woman, Irinuca. Ion Creangă spent several months at Irinuca's remote house on the Bistrița River, before the proximity of goats resulted in a scabies infection and his hastened departure for Pipirig, where he cured himself using birch extract, a folk remedy mastered by his maternal grandmother Nastasia.|$|E

This study utilized a single subject delayed multiple baseline design across subjects. Six elementary age students with developmental disabilities and six nondisabled <b>peer</b> <b>tutors</b> participated in the study. The students were videotaped during their physical education class and data were analyzed on discrete motor skill responses. The students were assigned to one of two protocols. Protocol 1 consisted of three conditions; baseline, assistance by an untrained <b>peer</b> <b>tutor,</b> and assistance by a trained <b>peer</b> <b>tutor.</b> The results of Protocol 1 data revealed that trained <b>peer</b> <b>tutors</b> were effective at assisting subjects with developmental disabilities improve their motor performance, while untrained <b>peer</b> <b>tutors</b> were not.

This study utilized a single subject multiple baseline design across subjects. Eight deaf 4 th and 5 th grade students and eight hearing 4 th and 5 th grade <b>peer</b> <b>tutors</b> participated in the study. The students were observed during their physical education class and data were analyzed on physical activity levels and <b>peer</b> <b>tutor</b> behavior. The deaf students and <b>peer</b> <b>tutors</b> were first observed during a baseline period of 4 - 6 classes with no intervention. The <b>peer</b> <b>tutors</b> were trained toward the latter part of the baseline period. The <b>peer</b> <b>tutor</b> intervention lasted from 11 - 13 classes. During the intervention, the <b>peer</b> <b>tutor</b> and deaf student participated in pairs for the fitness portion of the class. The results of the intervention demonstrated that the implementation of trained hearing <b>peer</b> <b>tutors</b> improved the physical activity levels of both the deaf students and <b>peer</b> <b>tutors.</b> The training of the <b>peer</b> <b>tutors</b> consisted of signs pertaining to: instruction, physical fitness, and teaching techniques in the areas of: cueing, feedback and reinforcement.

A 2007 meta-analysis of 55 studies of school-based social skills intervention found that they were minimally effective for children and adolescents with ASD, and a 2007 review found that social skills training has minimal empirical support for children with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} simple {{methods such as}} priming, prompt delivery, picture schedules, <b>peer</b> <b>tutoring,</b> and {{cooperative}} learning, that have been proven to help autistic students to prepare for class and to understand the material better. Priming is done by allowing the students to see the assignment or material before they are shown in class. Prompt delivery consists of giving prompts to the autistic children in order to elicit {{a response to the}} academic material. Picture schedules are used to outline the progression of a class and are visual cues to allow autistic children to know when changes in the activity are coming up. This method has proven to be very useful in helping the students follow the activities. <b>Peer</b> <b>tutoring</b> and cooperative learning are ways in which an autistic student and a nonhandicapped student are paired together in the learning process. This has shown be very effective for “increasing both academic success and social interaction.” There are more specific strategies that have been shown to improve an autistic’s education, such as LEAP, Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children, and Non-Model-Specific Special Education Programs for preschoolers. LEAP is “an intensive 12-month program that focuses on providing a highly structured and safe environment that helps students to participate in and derive benefit from educational programming” and focuses on children from 5-21 who are on the have a more severe case of autism. The goal of the program is to develop functional independence through academic instruction, vocational/translational curriculum, speech/language services, and other services personalized for each student. While LEAP, TEACCH, and Non-Model Specific Special Education Programs are all different strategies, there has been no evidence that one is more effective than the other.|$|E

Over the years more and more students have started acting as <b>peer</b> <b>tutors</b> for their fellow students. Previous research has proven {{the effectiveness of this}} didactical format. Studies that focus on the behavior and experiences of <b>peer</b> <b>tutors</b> remain relatively limited. A first small-scale empirical study (Berghmans, Struyven, & Dochy, 2009) showed that <b>peer</b> <b>tutors</b> can act facilitative. However, other researchers found that <b>peer</b> <b>tutors</b> tend to have difficulties acting this way as they show a tendency towards more directive actions. To nuance the earlier findings in our empirical study, a qualitative study was set up to shed light on peer tutors’ experiences concerning their behavior and role as <b>peer</b> <b>tutor.</b> Results indicate that <b>peer</b> <b>tutors</b> do understand the importance of acting facilitative. However, they tend to experience four main bottlenecks that challenge this type of behavior. A first challenge concerns a didactical issue, namely the process of questioning students. The second and third challenge concern dealing with students and their needs, more specifically dealing with students’ superficial expectations {{on the one hand and}} differentiating on the other hand. A fourth and last challenge concerns dealing with less able students and providing help at their level and pace.

Purposes of the research is to describe the implementation of <b>peer</b> <b>tutor</b> model in learning of Al-Qur‟an in SMP Negeri 1 Sambi Boyolali in 2015 / 2016 academic year. The research can be useful as a scientific discourse, especially on <b>peer</b> <b>tutor</b> model in learning of Al-Qur‟an. The research is field one with its data are obtained from teachers of Islamic Religious Education, extracurricular counselor of Al-Qur‟an reading and writing, students of 7 th and 8 th grades, and documents of SMP Negeri 1 Sambi, Boyolali. The data was collected by using interview, observation and documentation. The data was analyzed by using descriptive-qualitative analysis approach. Based on the research and data analysis, it can be concluded the <b>peer</b> <b>tutor</b> model in the secondary school was implemented 2 times a week, 15 minutes before Islamic Religious Education lesson started and also, it was implemented in extracurricular of Al-Qur‟an reading and writing after school hours. The implementation of the learning activity uses halaqah system, namely dividing a class into several small groups and every group has one <b>peer</b> <b>tutor.</b> The <b>peer</b> <b>tutor</b> model has benefits, namely relationship in the learning was closer and friendly and there was no clumsy feeling in asking something, because it was a friendly relationship.
