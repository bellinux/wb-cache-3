40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} analyze events leading to <b>pluggage</b> of a boiler. The proposed approach involves statistics, data partitioning, parameter reduction, and data mining. Two independent data mining algorithms have been applied to detect both static and dynamic relationships among the process parameters. The multi-angle data mining approach increases the ability to locate rare events {{as well as the}} reliability of the results. The proposed approach has been tested on a 750 MW commercial coal-fired boiler affected with an ash fouling condition that leads to boiler <b>pluggage,</b> thus resulting in unscheduled shutdowns. The cause of the boiler <b>pluggage</b> is not known. The rare event detection method presented in the paper identifies several critical time-based data segments that are indicative of the boiler <b>pluggage.</b> The events define a set of general guidelines that when followed should reduce the likelihood of boiler <b>pluggage.</b> The knowledge extracted by the data mining algorithm is an important component of an intelligent alarm system...|$|E

40|$|Tank 26 F {{supernate}} {{sample was}} sent by Savannah River Remediation to Savannah River National Laboratory for evaporation test to help understand the underlying cause of the recent gravity drain line (GDL) <b>pluggage</b> during operation of the 2 F Evaporator system. The supernate sample was characterized prior to the evaporation test. The evaporation test involved boiling the supernate in an open beaker until {{the density of the}} concentrate (evaporation product) was between 1. 4 to 1. 5 g/mL. It was followed by filtering and washing of the precipitated solids with deionized water. The concentrate supernate (or concentrate filtrate), the damp unwashed precipitated solids, and the wash filtrates were characterized. All the precipitated solids dissolved during water washing. A semi-quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis on the unwashed precipitated solids revealed their composition. All the compounds with the exception of silica (silicon oxide) are known to be readily soluble in water. Hence, their dissolution during water washing is not unexpected. Even though silica is a sparingly water-soluble compound, its dissolution is also not surprising. This stems from its small fraction in the solids as a whole and also its relative freshness. Assuming similar supernate characteristics, flushing the GDL with water (preferably warm) should facilitate dissolution and removal of future <b>pluggage</b> events as long as build up/aging of the sparingly soluble constituent (silica) is limited. On the other hand, since the amount of silica formed is relatively small, it is quite possible dissolution of the more soluble larger fraction will cause disintegration or fragmentation of the sparingly soluble smaller fraction (that may be embedded in the larger soluble solid mass) and allow its removal via suspension in the flushing water...|$|E
40|$|A {{remotely}} replaceable telerobotic manipulator (TRM) {{has been}} developed and deployed at the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) in support of its radioactive operation. The TRM replaces a Master-Slave Manipulator (MSM). The TRM is in use for both routine and recovery operations for the radioactive waste vitrification melter, the primary production device within the DWPF. The arm was designed for deployment and operation using an existing MSM penetration. This replacement of an existing MSM with a high power robotic device demonstrates the capability to perform similar replacement in other operating facilities. The MSM`s were originally deployed in the DWPF to perform routine light capacity tasks. During the testing phase of the DWPF, prior to its radioactive startup in 5 / 96, the need to remove glass deposits that can form at the melter discharge during filling of glass containment canisters was identified. The combination of high radiation and contamination in the DWPF melter cell during radioactive operation eliminated personnel entry as a recovery option. Therefore remote cleaning methods had to be devised. The MSM`s had neither the reach nor the strength required for this task. It became apparent that a robust manipulator arm would be required for recovery from these potential melter discharge <b>pluggage</b> events. The existing wall penetrations, used for the MSM`s, could not be altered for seismic and radiological reasons. The new manipulator was required to be of considerable reach, due to existing physical layout, and strength, due to the glass removal requirement. Additionally, the device would have to compatible with high radiation and remote crane installation. The physical size of the manipulator {{and the weight of}} components must be consistent with the existing facilities. It was recognized early-on that a manipulator of sufficient strength to recover from a <b>pluggage</b> event would require robotic functions to constrain undesirable motions...|$|E
40|$|A {{new system}} has been {{developed}} for removal of chloride contamination from kraft process liquors. The compact, skid-mounted system which utilizes ion exchange columns only 24 inches in height, is shown {{to be capable of}} removing 90 - 99 % of the chloride {{from a wide variety of}} sources including dissolved ESP catch, oxidized white liquor, spent bleach scrubber liquors, spent ion exchange demineralizer regenerants and caustic soda makeup. By removing chloride contamination, these liquors can be recycled to kraft recovery without causing a chloride buildup. By lowering the chloride content in kraft liquors, the sticky temperature of recovery boiler deposits can be significantly increased, which should lead to reduced <b>pluggage</b> and boiler down-time. Selectivity of the ion exchanger for chloride is extremely high and recovery of other chemicals such as sodium sulfate, sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide is demonstrated to be typically 92 - 98 %. Regeneration of sodium chloride from the resin is achieved with only water (ie. no chemicals), so that operating costs are negligable...|$|E
40|$|The Westinghouse Savannah River Company, {{located at}} the Savannah River Site in Aiken, South Carolina, is {{currently}} testing two types of filter media for possible deployment as in situ regenerable/cleanable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters. The filters are being investigated to replace conventional, disposable, glass-fiber, HEPA filters that require frequent removal, replacement, and disposal. This is not only costly and subjects site personnel to radiation exposure, but adds to the ever-growing waste disposal problem. The types of filter media being tested, {{as part of a}} National Energy Technology Laboratory procurement, are sintered nickel metal and ceramic monolith membrane. These media were subjected to a hostile environment to simulate conditions that challenge the high-level waste tank ventilation systems. The environment promoted rapid filter plugging to maximize the number of filter loading/cleaning cycles that would occur in a specified period of time. The filters were challenged using non-radioactive simulated high-level waste materials and atmospheric dust; materials that cause filter <b>pluggage</b> in the field. The filters are cleaned in situ using an aqueous solution...|$|E
40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{miniature}} mixer-settler tests were conducted to determine the source of iron and sulfur contamination in the uranium product stream ('' 1 EU'') of H Canyon's 2 nd Uranium Cycle. The problem was reproduced on the laboratory scale mixer-settlers by changing the feed location of ferrous sulfamate from stage D 4 to stage D 1. Other process variables effected no change. It was later determined that ferrous sulfamate (FS) solids had plugged the FS line to stage D 4, causing FS to backup a ventline and enter the Canyon process at stage D 1. <b>Pluggage</b> was almost certainly due to precipitation of FS solids during extended process downtime. During {{the search for the}} root cause, tests showed that FS solids were quite small (1 - 10 mm), and a portion of them could bypass the current Canyon prefilter (3 -mm). Also, additional tests were done to find an alternate means of reducing and thereby removing plutonium and neptunium from the uranium product. These tests showed that FS was a more effective reductant than either ascorbic acid or a hydroxylamine nitrate (HAN) / dilute FS combination...|$|E
40|$|SCR {{catalyst}} {{management has}} become an important operations and maintenance activity for coal-fired utility boilers in the United States. To facilitate this activity, a method to determine Catalyst Activity in situ is being developed. This report describes the methodology and {{presents the results of}} a two ozone season demonstration conducted at Alabama Power Company's Gorgas Unit 10 during the 2005 and 2006 ozone seasons. The results showed that the in situ measurements are in good agreement with the laboratory measurements and the technique has some advantages over the traditional laboratory method of determining Catalyst Activity and Reactor Potential. SCR Performance is determined by the overall Reactor Potential (the product of the Catalyst Activity and the available surface area per unit of flue gas). The in situ approach provides a direct measurement of Reactor Potential under actual operating conditions, whereas laboratory measurements of Catalyst Activity need to be coupled with estimates of catalyst <b>pluggage</b> and flue gas flowrate in order to assess Reactor Potential. The project also showed that the in situ activity results can easily be integrated into catalyst management software to aid in making informed catalyst decisions...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this DOE sponsored project was to successfully fire coal-water slurry in a fire-tube boiler that was designed for oil/gas firing and establish a data base that will be relevant to {{a large number of}} existing installations. Firing slurry in a fire-tube configuration is a very demanding application because of the extremely high heat release rates and the correspondingly low furnace volume where combustion can be completed. Recognizing that combustion efficiency is the major obstacle when firing slurry in a fire-tube boiler, the program was focused on innovative approaches for improving carbon burnout without major modifications to the boiler. The boiler system was successfully designed and operated to fire coal-water slurry for extended periods of time with few slurry related operational problems. The host facility was a 3. 8 million Btu/hr Cleaver-Brooks fire-tube boiler located on the University of Alabama Campus. A slurry atomizer was designed that provided outstanding atomization and was not susceptible to <b>pluggage.</b> The boiler was operated for over 1000 hours and 12 shipments of slurry were delivered. The new equipment engineered for the coal-water slurry system consisted of the following: combustion air and slurry heaters; cyclone; baghouse; fly ash reinjection system; new control system; air compressor; CWS/gas burner and gas valve train; and storage tank and slurry handling system...|$|E
40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{calcination}} process in a rotary lime kiln prevents any form of a direct product quality assessment while the calcined material is in the kiln. In addition, there are no automatic, lime quality analyzers to inform the operator in real-time. The product quality measurement of lime reburning in a rotary lime kiln has therefore always been an indirect, ""after the fact"" event. Manual sampling and testing by operators or lab personnel is the currently accepted procedure in kraft mills. Attempts at an automatic sampler and analyzer of the product {{just out of the}} kiln have failed. Indirect sensor based methods of measurement of the lime quality have also been tried, without success. A new generation of supervisory kiln control and optimization package built around a virtual residual carbonate analyzer was commissioned in DMI's 1230 t/d kraft mill in May, 1998. The performance of the new kiln controller so far is impressive, including a 72 % redn. of variations in the product quality and a redn. of over 15 % of specific energy consumption. Initial indications are that it may also reduce ring buildup and <b>pluggage.</b> The control algorithm proved to be robust, requiring only minimal intervention. "...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate a}} variety of materials and coatings for the DWPF pour spout bellows liner. The intent was to identify materials that would minimize or eliminate adherence of glass on the bellows liner wall and help minimize possible <b>pluggage</b> during glass pouring operations in DWPF. Glass has been observed adhering to the current bellow`s liner, which is made of 304 L stainless steel. Materials were identified which successfully allowed molten glass to hit these surfaces and not adhere. Results {{of this study suggest}} that if these materials are used in the pouring system glass could still fall into the canister without appreciable plugging, even if an unstable glass stream is produced. The materials should next be evaluated under the most realistic DWPF conditions possible. Other findings of this study include the following: (1) increasing coupon thickness produced a favorable increase in the glass sticking temperature; (2) highly polished surfaces, with the exception of the oxygen-free copper coupon coated with Armoloy dense chromium, did not produce a significant improvement in the glass sticking temperature, increasing angle of contact of the coupon to the falling glass did not yield a significant performance improvement; (3) electroplating with gold and silver and various diffusion coatings did not produce a significant increase in the glass sticking temperature. However, they may provide added oxidation and corrosion resistance for copper and bronze liners. Boron nitride coatings delaminated immediately after contact with the molten glass...|$|E
40|$|The Savannah River Site's (SRS) Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) began {{stabilizing}} {{high level}} waste (HLW) {{in a glass}} matrix in 1996. Over the past few years, {{there have been several}} process and equipment improvements at the DWPF to increase {{the rate at which the}} high level waste can be stabilized. These improvements have either directly increased waste processing rates or have desensitized the process to upsets, thereby minimizing downtime and increasing production. Improvements due to optimization of waste throughput with increased HLW loading of the glass resulted in a 6 % waste throughput increase based upon operational efficiencies. Improvements in canister production include the pour spout heated bellows liner (5 %), glass surge (siphon) protection software (2 %), melter feed pump software logic change to prevent spurious interlocks of the feed pump with subsequent dilution of feed stock (2 %) and optimization of the steam atomized scrubber (SAS) operation to minimize downtime (3 %) for a total increase in canister production of 12 %. A number of process recovery efforts have allowed continued operation. These include the off gas system <b>pluggage</b> and restoration, slurry mix evaporator (SME) tank repair and replacement, remote cleaning of melter top head center nozzle, remote melter internal inspection, SAS pump J-Tube recovery, inadvertent pour scenario resolutions, dome heater transformer bus bar cooling water leak repair and new Infra-red camera for determination of glass height in the canister are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The offgas {{system of}} the Am/Cm pilot melter at TNX was {{characterized}} by measuring the particulate evolution using a cascade impactor and EPA Method 29. This sampling work was performed by John Harden of the Clemson Environmental Technologies Laboratory, under SCUREF Task SC 0056. Elemental analyses were performed by the SRTC Mobile Laboratory. Operation of the Am/Cm melter with B 2000 frit has resulted in deposition of PbO and boron compounds in the offgas system that has contributed to <b>pluggage</b> of the High Efficiency Mist Eliminator (HEME). Sampling of the offgas system was performed to quantify the amount of particulate in the offgas system under several sets of conditions. Particulate concentration and particle size distribution were measured just downstream of the melter pressure control air addition port and at the HEME inlet. At both locations, the particulate was measured with and without steam to the film cooler while the melter was idled at about 1450 degrees Celsius. Additional determinations were made at the melter location during feeding and during idling at 1150 degrees Celsius rather than 1450 degrees Celsius (both with no steam to the film cooler). Deposition of particulates upstream of the melter sample point may have, and most likely did occur in each run, so the particulate concentrations measured do no necessarily reflect the total particulate emission at the melt surface. However, the data {{may be used in}} a relative sense to judge the system performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{technical}} {{objectives of}} this project are: (a) To identify the partitioning of inorganic coal constituents among vapor, submicron fume, and fly ash products generated during the combustion of pulverized coal {{under a variety of}} combustion conditions. Fuel lean and fuel rich combustion conditions will be considered. (b) To identify and quantify the fundamental processes by which the transformations of minerals and organically-associated inorganic species occur. Emphasis will be placed on identifying any changes that occur as a result of combustion under sub-stoichiometric combustion conditions. (c) To incorporate the effects of combustion stoichiometry into an Engineering Model for Ash Formation based upon the understanding developed in (a) and (b). When completed, this model will predict the particle size and chemical composition distributions of ash formed during the combustion of pulverized coal under a broad range of conditions. The work discussed in this report highlights the accomplishments of the seventh quarter of this two year project. This includes University of Arizona efforts to minimize periodicity in the coal feeder for the drop tube furnace, and MIT efforts to calculate the concentrations of CO, CO{sub 2 }, and O{sub 2 } surrounding a burning char particle. In Section 3, the use of a pulsed gas flow to maintain a smooth coal feed to the drop tube furnace is discussed. Addition of pulsing action, driven by a peristaltic pump, has eliminated the coal feeder <b>pluggage</b> problems that had been occurring. In Section 4, the development of a single particle char combustion model by MIT is discussed. The model is then used for calculating oxygen, CO, and CO{sub 2 } concentrations on the char particle surface as a function of char particle diameter.

40|$|The Quartz Melt Rate Furnace (QMRF) was {{developed}} to study the melt rate and offgas composition of simulated Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) melter feed. The objective of this testing was to evaluate whether the apparatus {{could be used to}} study the offgas chemistry of melting batches and perform small-scale slurry-fed melt rate tests. The furnace was tested in three different configurations: a dry-fed test with offgas analysis, a slurry-fed test without offgas analysis, and a slurry-fed test with offgas analysis. During the dry-fed test, offgas composition was successfully measured throughout the run and total offgas flow was calculated from the helium tracer concentration. During the slurry-feeding tests without offgas analysis, the furnace exhibited stable feeding behavior with no problems with feed tube <b>pluggage.</b> Feeding behavior was used to measure the melt rate of Sludge Batch 3 with Frit 320 and with Frit 418. Both frits had approximately the same melt rate during the tests based on amount of melter feed added per minute. During the slurry-fed test with offgas analysis, spikes in the data prevented overall offgas flow analysis from the helium tracer, but the ratio of different offgas species allowed the composition data to be compared between runs. Minor improvements were identified that would enhance the performance of the furnace and further testing should be performed to optimize the performance of the apparatus. These tests should focus on increasing the stability of offgas composition data by providing more surge capacity in the offgas system, determining the sensitivity of the furnace to melt rate during slurry-fed tests and refining the lid heat power to optimize melt rate measurements, and to develop the capability to utilize the system with radioactive feeds...|$|E
40|$|Natural gas {{hydrates}} {{are solid}} crystalline compounds which form when molecules smaller than n-butane contact molecules {{of water at}} elevated pressures and reduced temperatures, both {{above and below the}} ice point. Because these crystalline compounds plug flow channels, they are undesirable. In this project the authors proposed an alternate approach of controlling hydrate formation by preventing hydrate growth into a sizeable mass which could block a flow channel. The authors call this new technique kinetic inhibition, because while it allows the system to exist in the hydrate domain, it prevents the kinetic agglomeration of small hydrate crystals to the point of <b>pluggage</b> of a flow channel. In order to investigate the kinetic means of inhibiting hydrate formation, they held two consortium meetings, on June 1, 1990 and on August 31, 1990. At subsequent meetings, the authors determined the following four stages of the project, necessary to reach the goal of determining a new hydrate field inhibitor: (1) a rapid screening method was to be determined for testing the hydrate kinetic formation period of many surfactants and polymer candidates (both individually and combined), the present report presents the success of two screening apparatuses: a multi-reactor apparatus which is capable of rapid, high volume screening, and the backup screening method [...] a viscometer for testing with gas at high pressure; (2) the construction of two high, constant pressure cells were to experimentally confirm the success of the chemicals in the rapid screening apparatus; (3) in the third phase of the work, Exxon volunteered to evaluate the performance of the best chemicals from the previous two stages in their 4 inch I.

40|$|This thesis has {{addressed}} several {{gaps in the}} knowledge {{with regards to the}} calcium looping cycle for carbon dioxide capture, including identification of engineering challenges associated with the scale-up of the technology to pilot scale and beyond; assessment of changes in sorbent morphology during the pilot scale capture process; and partitioning of elemental impurities in the limestone between the solid and gaseous phase during the carbon dioxide capture process. Hydrodynamic investigations identified the optimum superficial velocities required for the reactor in order to optimise solids entrainment and flux, and to minimise gas bypassing. Estimations made in determining how particle attrition would affect minimum fluidisation velocity confirmed a decrease of approximately 0. 09 m/s for every 5 % reduction in particle size. Amendments made to the exhaust diameter and position, and the loop seals, improved the pressure balance of the system thus enhancing solids transfer. Reactor and process modifications, including modification of carbonator temperature, and maintenance of temperature above 420 °C in standpipes resulted in improved carbon dioxide capture %. Increasing bed inventory had a positive effect of carbon dioxide capture % due to an increased Ca looping ratio. Steam addition also benefitted the carbonation process, due to improved sorbent morphology and therefore carbon dioxide diffusion into the sorbent. Sulfur dioxide was considered to have a detrimental effect on carbon dioxide capture due to pore <b>pluggage,</b> although burner- derived steam had a positive effect in maintaining capture %. Gaseous elemental emissions from the process were low for all elements, but concentrations of elements in the solid sorbent phase were influenced by bed inventory, implying that filtering systems may be required in industry for the large masses of sorbent required. Concentrations of elements in the sorbent were identified to be below levels typical of cement, with the exception of Ni, implying that there is potential for spent sorbent {{to be used in the}} cement industry with adequate mitigation measures in place...|$|E
40|$|On March 18, 2009 a Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) GC Line Filter Assembly was {{received}} at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL). This filter assembly {{was removed from}} operation following the completion of Sludge Batch 4 processing in the DWPF. Work on this sample was requested in a Technical Assistance Request. This document reports the pictures, observations, samples collected, and analytical results for the assembly. The assembly arrived at SRNL separated into its three component filters: high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) - 1, HEPA- 2, and a high efficiency mist evaporator (HEME). Each stage of the assembly's media was sampled and examined visually and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Solids built up in the filter housing following the first stage HEME, were dissolved in dilute nitric acid and analyzed by ICP-AES and the undissolved white solids were analyzed by x-ray diffraction (XRD). The {{vast majority of the}} material {{in each of the three}} stages of the DWPF GC Line Filter Assembly appears to be contaminated with a Hg compound that is {approx} 59 wt% Hg on a total solids basis. The Hg species was identified by XRD analysis to contain a mixture of Hg{sub 4 }(OH) (NO{sub 3 }) {sub 3 } and Hg{sub 10 }(OH) {sub 4 }(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 6 }. Only in the core sample of the second stage HEPA, did this material appear to be completely covering portions of the filter media, possibly explaining the pressure drops observed by DWPF. The fact that the material migrates through the HEME filter and both HEPA filters, and that it was seen collecting on the outlet side of the HEME filter, would seem to indicate that these filters are not efficient at removing this material. Further SRAT off-gas system modeling should help determine the extent of Hg breakthrough past the Mercury Water Wash Tank (MWWT). The SRAT off-gas system has not been modeled since startup of the facility. Improvements to the efficiency of Hg stripping prior to the ammonia scrubber would seem to be the only way to prevent/mitigate the formation of the compounds found in the GC Line Filter Assembly filters and therefore prevent <b>pluggage</b> of this filter assembly...|$|E
40|$|High-level {{nuclear waste}} is being immobilized at the Savannah River Site (SRS) by {{vitrification}} into borosilicate glass at the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). Control of the Reduction/Oxidation (REDOX) equilibrium in the DWPF melter {{is critical for}} processing high level liquid wastes. Foaming, cold cap roll-overs, and off-gas surges all {{have an impact on}} pouring and melt rate during processing of high-level waste (HLW) glass. All of these phenomena can impact waste throughput and attainment in Joule heated melters such as the DWPF. These phenomena are caused by gas-glass disequilibrium when components in the melter feeds convert to glass and liberate gases such as H{sub 2 }O vapor (steam), CO{sub 2 }, O{sub 2 }, H{sub 2 }, NO{sub x}, and/or N{sub 2 }. During the feed-to-glass conversion in the DWPF melter, multiple types of reactions occur in the cold cap and in the melt pool that release gaseous products. The various gaseous products can cause foaming at the melt pool surface. Foaming should be avoided as much as possible because an insulative layer of foam on the melt surface retards heat transfer to the cold cap and results in low melt rates. Uncontrolled foaming can also result in a blockage of critical melter or melter off-gas components. Foaming can also increase the potential for melter pressure surges, which would then make it difficult to maintain a constant pressure differential between the DWPF melter and the pour spout. Pressure surges can cause erratic pour streams and possible <b>pluggage</b> of the bellows as well. For these reasons, the DWPF uses a REDOX strategy and controls the melt REDOX between 0. 09 {le} Fe{sup 2 +}/{summation}Fe {le} 0. 33. Controlling the DWPF melter at an equilibrium of Fe{sup + 2 }/{summation}Fe {le} 0. 33 prevents metallic and sulfide rich species from forming nodules that can accumulate {{on the floor of the}} melter. Control of foaming, due to deoxygenation of manganic species, is achieved by converting oxidized MnO{sub 2 } or Mn{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } species to MnO during melter preprocessing. At the lower redox limit of Fe{sup + 2 }/{summation}Fe {approx} 0. 09 about 99 % of the Mn{sup + 4 }/Mn{sup + 3 } is converted to Mn{sup + 2 }. Therefore, the lower REDOX limits eliminates melter foaming from deoxygenation...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) has {{millions}} of gallons of radioactive liquid and sludge wastes stored in underground tanks at several of its sites. In order to comply with various regulations and to circumvent potential problems associated with tank integrity, these wastes must be retrieved from the tanks, transferred to treatment facilities (or other storage locations), and processed to stable waste forms. The sludge wastes will typically be mobilized by some mechanical means (e. g., mixer pump, submerged jet) and mixed with the respective supernatants to create slurries that can be transferred by pipeline to the desired destination. Depending on the DOE site, these slurries may be transferred up to six miles. Since the wastes are radioactive, it is critically important for the transfers to be made without plugging a pipeline. To reduce such a risk, the relevant properties of the slurry (e. g., density, suspended solids concentration, viscosity, and particle size distribution) should be determined to be within acceptable limits prior to transfer. These properties should also be continuously monitored and controlled within specified limits while the transfer is in progress. The baseline method for determining the transport properties of slurries involves sampling and analysis; however, this method is time-consuming, and costly, and it does not provide real-time information. In addition, personnel who collect and analyze the samples are exposed to radiation. It is also questionable as to whether a laboratory analyst can obtain representative aliquots from the sample jar for these solid-liquid mixtures. The alternative method for determining the transport properties is in-line analysis. An in-line instrument is one that is connected to the process, analyzes the slurry as it flows through or by the instrument, and provides the results within seconds. This instrument can provide immediate feedback to operators so that, when necessary, the operators can respond quickly to counteract conditions that could lead to pipeline <b>pluggage</b> (e. g., backflushing the pipeline with water). One of the highest priorities is to determine the concentration of suspended solids in each of the slurries. In the project described in this report, two Coriolis meters were used simultaneously to create a suspended solids monitoring system that would provide accurate results with high precision. One Coriolis meter was used to measure the density of the slurry, while the other meter was used to measure the density of the carrier fluid (i. e., after filtration to remove the solid particles). The suspended solids concentration was then calculated from the density relationships between the slurry, the carrier fluid, and the dry solid particles. The latter density was determined by laboratory analysis and was assumed to be constant throughout the periods that grab samples were collected...|$|E
40|$|This report {{broadens}} {{a previous}} review of published literature on corrosion of recovery boiler superheater tube materials {{to consider the}} performance of candidate materials at temperatures near the deposit melting temperature in advanced boilers firing coal, wood-based fuels, and waste materials {{as well as in}} gas turbine environments. Discussions of corrosion mechanisms focus on the reactions in fly ash deposits and combustion gases that can give corrosive materials access to the surface of a superheater tube. Setting the steam temperature of a biomass boiler is a compromise between wasting fuel energy, risking <b>pluggage</b> that will shut the unit down, and creating conditions that will cause rapid corrosion on the superheater tubes and replacement expenses. The most important corrosive species in biomass superheater corrosion are chlorine compounds and the most corrosion resistant alloys are typically FeCrNi alloys containing 20 - 28 % Cr. Although most of these materials contain many other additional additions, there is no coherent theory of the alloying required to resist the combination of high temperature salt deposits and flue gases that are found in biomass boiler superheaters that may cause degradation of superheater tubes. After depletion of chromium by chromate formation or chromic acid volatilization exceeds a critical amount, the protective scale gives way to a thick layer of Fe{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } over an unprotective (FeCrNi) {sub 3 }O{sub 4 } spinel. This oxide is not protective and can be penetrated by chlorine species that cause further acceleration of the corrosion rate by a mechanism called active oxidation. Active oxidation, cited as the cause of most biomass superheater corrosion under chloride ash deposits, does not occur in the absence of these alkali salts when the chloride is present as HCl gas. Although a deposit is more corrosive at temperatures where it is molten than at temperatures where it is frozen, increasing superheater tube temperatures through the measured first melting point of fly ash deposits does not necessarily produce a step increase in corrosion rate. Corrosion rate typically accelerates at temperatures below the first melting temperature and mixed deposits may have a broad melting temperature range. Although the environment at a superheater tube surface is initially that of the ash deposits, this chemistry typically changes as the deposits mature. The corrosion rate is controlled by the environment and temperature at the tube surface, which can only be measured indirectly. Some results are counter-intuitive. Two boiler manufacturers and a consortium have developed models to predict fouling and corrosion in biomass boilers in order to specify tube materials for particular operating conditions. It would be very useful to compare the predictions of these models regarding corrosion rates and recommended alloys in the boiler environments where field tests will be performed in the current program. Manufacturers of biomass boilers have concluded that it is more cost-effective to restrict steam temperatures, to co-fire biofuels with high sulfur fuels and/or to use fuel additives rather than try to increase fuel efficiency by operating with superheater tube temperatures above melting temperature of fly ash deposits. Similar strategies have been developed for coal fired and waste-fired boilers. Additives are primarily used to replace alkali metal chloride deposits with higher melting temperature and less corrosive alkali metal sulfate or alkali aluminum silicate deposits. Design modifications that have been shown to control superheater corrosion include adding a radiant pass (empty chamber) between the furnace and the superheater, installing cool tubes immediately upstream of the superheater to trap high chloride deposits, designing superheater banks for quick replacement, using an external superheater that burns a less corrosive biomass fuel, moving circulating fluidized bed (CFB) superheaters from the convective pass into the hot recirculated fluidizing medium and adding an insulating layer to superheater tubes to raise their surface temperature above the dew point temperature of alkali chlorides. These design changes offer advantages but introduce other challenges. For example, operating with superheater temperatures above the dew point of alkali chlorides could require the use of creep-resistant tube alloys and doesn't eliminate chloride corrosion. Improved test methods that can be applied within this project include automated dimensional metrology to make a statistical analysis of depth of penetration and corrosion product thickness, and simultaneous thermal analysis measurements to quantify the melting of complex ashes and avoid the unreliability of the standard ash fusion test. Other important developments in testing include the installation of individually-temperature-controlled superheater loops for corrosion testing in operating boilers and temperature gradient testing...|$|E
