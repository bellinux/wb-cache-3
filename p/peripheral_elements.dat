40|$|Riboswitches are gene {{regulatory}} elements {{found in}} the 5 ’-untranslated region of many bacterial genes. The direct binding of small molecule ligands induces conformational changes in the RNA that influence downstream expression machinery and determine the transcription or translation of an attached gene. Cobalamin riboswitches, which bind coenzyme-B 12 and other cobalamin variants, are divided into two distinct classes. Cbl-I riboswitches contain a large <b>peripheral</b> <b>element</b> that limits riboswitch binding to only coenzyme-B 12 (adenosylcobalamin, or AdoCbl). Cbl-II riboswitches do not contain the same <b>peripheral</b> <b>element,</b> and were originally thought to only bind smaller species of cobalamin (including methylcobalamin, or MeCbl). However, a sample of Cbl-II variants reveals a range of riboswitch binding affinities to both AdoCbl and MeCbl, with some RNAs binding both species of cobalamin with equal affinity. In {{order to determine the}} structural components of the Cbl-II riboswitches that are important in establishing ligand selectivity, a series of RNA mutants were designed to convert an AdoCbl-selective riboswitch (WTenv 50) to MeCbl-selectivity.

50|$|An {{example of}} static core {{function}} is firing a rifle in the prone position. To maintain accuracy, the shooter {{must be able}} to transfer his or her own body weight and the weight of the rifle into the earth. Any attempt of the shooter to create a dynamic motion of the sights (muscle the sights onto the target vs. allowing the posture to aim) will result in a jerky posture where the sights do not sit still on the target. For the shooter to maintain accuracy, the muscles cannot exert force on the rifle, and the skeleton must be aligned to set the rifle (and therefore the sights) onto the target. The core, while resting on the ground and relatively far away from the rifle, is nevertheless aligning the spine and pelvis to which the shoulder and arms and neck are connected. For these <b>peripheral</b> <b>elements</b> to remain static, and not move unnecessarily, the spine, pelvis, and rib cage must be aligned towards this end. Thus the core muscles provide support of the axial skeleton (skull, spine, and tailbone) in an alignment where the upper body can provide a steady, solid base for the rifle to remain motionless.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, {{scientists}} started {{to study how}} the group I intron achieves its native structure in vitro, and some mechanisms of RNA folding have been appreciated thus far. It is agreed that the tertiary structure is folded after {{the formation of the}} secondary structure. During folding, RNA molecules are rapidly populated into different folding intermediates, the intermediates containing native interactions are further folded into the native structure through a fast folding pathway, while those containing non-native interactions are trapped in metastable or stable non-native conformations, and the process of conversion to the native structure occurs very slowly. It is evident that group I introns differing in the set of <b>peripheral</b> <b>elements</b> display different potentials in entering the fast folding pathway. Meanwhile, cooperative assembly of the tertiary structure is important for the folding of the native structure. Nevertheless, folding of group I introns in vitro encounters both thermodynamic and kinetic challenges. A few RNA binding proteins and chaperones have been shown to promote the folding of group I introns in vitro and in bacteria by stabilizing the native intermediates, and by destabilizing the non-native structures, respectively.|$|E

50|$|Chokun used ryuka, the {{classical}} poetry of Okinawa, and classical music for his songs. Instruments typically included three stringed instruments: the sanshin (brought from China), the kutu, and the kucho; the hanso, a flute; and two drums, the odaiko and the kodaiko. The lyrics were usually sung by the sanshin players, {{who were the}} most important instrumental component, and songs were used to heighten the mood in intense situations. These songs were crucial to the performance, and often replaced dialogue much like in Broadway musicals (Foley 8). And as opposed to the spirited music of Okinawa’s common folk, this music was formal and somewhat austere, projecting the idea of nobility through the music. Delivery is formal and full of metaphors just as in Japanese literature of the time. Two styles were applied: strong singing, or kyogin, which was reserved for powerful male roles, and soft singing, known as wagin or yuwajin, which was used for female or young male roles (Foley 8). It {{is important to remember that}} most of the important singing was done by the musicians. The musicians either sat onstage or stage left during the performances, or sat behind a drop since the stage was ordinarily an eighteen-foot platform, much like that of the no (Foley 9). When performed in the present day, the musicians will sit either stage left or in the wings, preserving the uncluttered look of the original, and it is interesting to note that at no time are there more than six actors on stage (Thornbury 231).

40|$|The {{presence}} of non-conserved <b>peripheral</b> <b>elements</b> in all naturally occurring group I introns underline their importance in ensuring the natural intron function. Recently, we reported that some <b>peripheral</b> <b>elements</b> are conserved in group I introns of IE subgroup. Using self-splicing activity as a readout, our initial screening revealed that one such conserved <b>peripheral</b> <b>elements,</b> P 2. 1, is mainly required to fold the catalytically active {{structure of the}} Candida ribozyme, an IE intron. Unexpectedly, the essential function of P 2. 1 resides in a sequence-conserved short stem of P 2. 1 {{but not in a}} long-range interaction associated with the loop of P 2. 1 that stabilizes the ribozyme structure. The P 2. 1 stem is indispensable in folding the compact ribozyme core, most probably by forming a triple helical interaction with two core helices, P 3 and P 6. Surprisingly, although the ribozyme lacking the P 2. 1 stem renders a loosely folded core and the loss of self-splicing activity requires two consecutive transesterifications, the mutant ribozyme efficiently catalyzes the first transesterification reaction. These results suggest that the intron self-splicing demands much more ordered structure than does one independent transesterification, highlighting that the universally present <b>peripheral</b> <b>elements</b> achieve their functional importance by enabling the highly ordered structure through diverse tertiary interactions...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{efforts have}} been made to unravel the {{independent}} roles of monovalent cations in RNA folding, primarily using the Tetrahymena ribozyme as a model. Here we report how monovalent cations impact the folding of the Candida ribozyme.

When Mg 2 +-induced ribozyme folding proceeded on the same energy landscape, the altered starting state led to a rapid assembly of the correct ribozyme core and a fivefold to 10 -fold increase in the ribozyme activity. Moreover, when the ribozyme folding was started from a misfolding-prone state, high millimolar concentrations of monovalent cations moderately elevated the ribozyme activity by efficiently resolving the misfolding of a <b>peripheral</b> <b>element,</b> P 5 abc...|$|R

At strong coupling, a uniform state is expected with active or inactive elements at small or large degree networks, respectively. A nontrivial stationary spatial pattern, corresponding to an activation pinning, is predicted to occur at an intermediate number of <b>peripheral</b> <b>elements</b> and at intermediate coupling strengths, where the central activation of the network is pinned, but the peripheral activation propagates toward the center.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The conserved {{catalytic}} {{core of the}} Tetrahymena group I ribozyme is {{encircled by}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>elements.</b> We have conducted a detailed structure−function study of the five longrange tertiary contacts that fasten these distal elements together. Mutational ablation {{of each of the}} tertiary contacts destabilizes the folded ribozyme, indicating a role of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>elements</b> in overall stability. Once folded, three of the five tertiary contact mutants exhibit defects in overall catalysis that range from 20 - to 100 -fold. These and the subsequent results indicate that the structural ring of <b>peripheral</b> <b>elements</b> does not act as a unitary element; rather, individual connections have distinct roles as further revealed by kinetic and thermodynamic dissection of the individual reaction steps. Ablation of P 14 or the metal ion core/ metal ion core receptor (MC/MCR) destabilizes docking of the substrate-containing P 1 helix into tertiary interactions with the ribozyme’s conserved core. In contrast, ablation of the L 9 /P 5 contact weakens binding of the guanosine nucleophile by slowing its association, without affecting P 1 docking.
