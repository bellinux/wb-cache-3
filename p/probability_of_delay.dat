In a multi-server queue with unlimited waiting space, the appropriate server utilization typically increases as the number of servers (and the arrival rate) increases. We explain this economy of scale and give a rough quantitative characterization. We also show how increased variability in the arrival and service processes tends to reduce server utilization with a given grade of service. As part of this analysis, we develop simple approximations for the mean steady-state waiting time and the full steady-state waiting-time distribution.

40|$|Background: Minimizing {{emergency}} medical service (EMS) response time is a central objective of prehospital care, yet the potential influence of built environment features such as urban sprawl on EMS system performance is often not considered. Purpose: This study measures the association between urban sprawl and EMS response time {{to test the hypothesis}} that features of sprawling development increase the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>delayed</b> ambulance arrival. Methods: In 2008, EMS response times for 43, 424 motor-vehicle crashes were obtained from the Fatal Analysis Reporting System, a national census of crashes involving! 1 fatality. Sprawl at each crash location was measured using a continuous county-level index previously developed by Ewing et al. The association between sprawl and the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> a <b>delayed</b> ambulance arrival (! 8 minutes) was then measured using generalized linear mixed modeling to account for correlation among crashes from the same county. Results: Urban sprawl is significantly associated with increased EMS response time and a higher <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>delayed</b> ambulance arrival (p! 0. 03). This probability increases quadratically as the severity of sprawl increases while controlling for nighttime crash occurrence, road conditions, and presence of construction. For example, in sprawling counties (e. g., Fayette County GA), the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> a <b>delayed</b> ambulance arrival for daytime crashes in dry con-ditions without construction was 69 % (95 % CI! 66 %, 72 %) compared with 31 % (95 % CI! 28 %, 35 %) in counties with prominent smart-growth characteristics (e. g., Delaware County PA). Conclusions: Urban sprawl is significantly associated with increased EMS response time and a higher <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>delayed</b> ambulance arrival following motor-vehicle crashes in the U.

40|$|Railways are an {{important}} mode of transportation all around the world. Inherent privileges of rail transportation, and increasing tendency of governments towards maximized utilization of railway systems, {{emphasize the importance of}} having high-quality train services. Reliability of train services as {{an important}} quality factor, is evaluated through looking at various indicators, including the punctuality. Maintaining the services punctual, regardless of seasonal conditions has been a perennial concern for railways authorities. Though, it has become highlighted after many countries in Europe and Northern America, experienced widespread delays in train services, following the recent extreme weather patterns. In order to address the issues with winter operation of trains, the current study (a) explores the expected consequences of various winter phenomena on railway operations, (b) reviews the technical and managerial problems that arose in the past winters, (c) gathers the existing countermeasures for addressing those issues, and (d) discusses the reasons why, despite many years of experience, railways are still being taken by surprise with occurrence of known winter phenomena. Furthermore, (e) development of a number of winterization measures in Norwegian railway infrastructure are studied, and (f) their impacts on winter performance of Norwegian railways in term of punctuality is reviewed.

30|$|Intra-class {{fairness}} {{issues for}} delay-sensitive traffic: scheduling rules for delay-sensitive traffic consider {{the ratio of}} instantaneous channel quality and time-averaged throughput (proportional fair rule) along with either the linear [10], logarithmic [15], or exponential [11, 15] function of the head-of-line (HoL) delay [16]. The HoL delay refers {{to the amount of}} time packets that reside in the buffer and is also known as the sojourn time. It {{is important to note that}} the video is delay-sensitive traffic; hence, packets arriving late are generally not useful at the receiver. Therefore, packets are associated with a predefined HoL delay bound and packets violating the delay bound are dropped from the queue. The utilization of HoL delay and the proportional fair rule in the scheduling decisions are not sufficient to avoid delay bound violation of flows having lower channel quality. Video traffic exhibits highly variable bit rate characteristics, i.e., the instantaneous peak rate is higher than the average rate. Lower channel quality video flows exhibiting peak instantaneous rate have high <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> bound violation mainly because of the proportional fair rule in the scheduling decisions. In other words, these scheduling rules achieve higher HoL delay for the packets of flows having higher average rate and lower channel quality. On the other hand, flows having good channel quality and lower average rate are scheduled way before their delay bound. The <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> bound violation of the flows exhibiting lower channel quality and higher average rate is very high which results in an unfair system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this study, a {{first order}} {{investigation}} {{of the issue of}} resource allocation between circuit voice, packet data and packet voice was completed. The study was done with reference to the GSM / GPRS air interface. To study the allocation of resources, suitable traffic source models were developed to represent the nature of the traffic offered to the base station subsystem. Circuit voice and packet data were represented using Markovian arrivals and exponentially distributed holding times. Voice over IP was modelled using a two-state Markov modulated Poisson process. The base station subsystem was modelled as a continuous time controller with eight channels (one GSM / GPRS TDMA frame). The radio propagation environment was considered by means of a large-scale propagation model, which would merely alter the load presented to the developed simulator package. From the results of the simulations, it was found that insufficient data resources lead to similar packet delay regardless of the packet size. It was found that if capacity on demand is used, then the data resources could equal the load. In the case of sufficient data channels, with capacity on demand, additional channels have a greater effect on average delay than the probability of it occurring. Prioritisation of VoIP packets did not significantly alter the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> but affected the average packet delay. Packet size had a greater effect on average delay than the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay.</b> In the case of all eight channels being used for VoIP and data, the combined load should not exceed seven erlang, indicating that a higher voice load could be supported with VoIP than with circuit switched voice...|$|E
