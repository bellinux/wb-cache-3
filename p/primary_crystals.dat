In zinc-based alloys, the <b>primary</b> zinc-rich <b>crystals</b> can be dendritic or needle-like in two dimensions. For the dendritic crystals, their growth pattern and orientation behaviors under HMFs have been investigated.

The crystallization of inclusion has a large effect on the rolling process. How-ever, there is little study of the effect of sulfur on the crystallization of inclusion. In the previous paper, the authors were investigated the sulfur behavior in the CaO–Al 2 O 3 slag at the eutectic composition (CAEU) under controlled atmosphere. In the present study, the effects of sulfur on the TTT diagrams were mea-sured by the hot thermocouple method under controlled atmosphere. 1 mass%, 5 mass % and 10 mass% CaS were added to the eutectic composition of calcium aluminate (CAEU). The crystal region in TTT diagrams was expanded by the addition of CaS from 1 mass % to 10 mass% under Ar atmosphere. And the start of crystallization became faster with the increase of CaS addition. The crystal phases were monocalcium aluminate (CA) and tricalcium aluminate (C 3 A) regardless to the CaS content. However, <b>primary</b> <b>crystal</b> was changed from the content of CaS.

40|$|The cavitation-induced {{fragmentation}} of <b>primary</b> <b>crystals</b> formed in Al alloys were investigated {{for the first}} time by high-speed imaging using a novel experimental approach. Three representative primary crystal types, Al 3 Ti, Si and Al 3 V with different morphologies and mechanical properties were first extracted by deep etching of the corresponding Al alloys and then subjected to ultrasonic cavitation processing in distilled water. The dynamic interaction between the cavitation bubbles and <b>primary</b> <b>crystals</b> was imaged in situ and in real time. Based on the recorded image sequences, the fragmentation mechanisms of <b>primary</b> <b>crystals</b> were studied. It was found that there are three major mechanisms by which the <b>primary</b> <b>crystals</b> were fragmented by cavitation bubbles. The first one was a slow process via fatigue-type failure. A cyclic pressure exerted by stationary pulsating bubbles caused the propagation of a crack pre-existing in the primary crystal to a critical length which led to fragmentation. The second mechanism was a sudden process due to the collapse of bubbles in a passing cavitation cloud. The pressure produced upon the collapse of the cloud promoted rapid monotonic crack growth and fast fracture in the <b>primary</b> <b>crystals.</b> The third observed mechanism was normal bending fracture {{as a result of the}} high pressure arising from the collapse of a bubble cloud and the crack formation at the branch connection points of dendritic <b>primary</b> <b>crystals.</b> The {{fragmentation of}} dendrite branches due to the interaction between two freely moving dendritic <b>primary</b> <b>crystals</b> was also observed.

Finite element analysis indicated that the cooling rate of 10 mm thick glass was notably lower than that of 2 mm thick glass.

40|$|Abstract—The {{nucleation}} {{and growth}} of primary Al 2 Cu phase in the Al- 34. 3 wt%Cu hypereutectic alloy without and with magnetic fields have been investigated by differential thermal analysis (DTA). The DTA curves indicated that the nucleation temperature of primary phase was significantly reduced in a magnetic field. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirmed that the c-axes of primary Al 2 Cu crystals oriented along the direction parallel to a magnetic field. The microstructures showed that <b>primary</b> <b>crystals</b> aligned along a magnetic field and that their number distinctly increased with increasing a magnetic field as well. The suppression of nucleation in a magnetic field could be caused by the increase of the interfacial energy between the liquid and nucleus and the reduction of atom diffusion rates while the orientation of <b>primary</b> <b>crystals</b> were mainly attributed to both of the magnetic torque and the thermoelectric magnetohydrodynamic (TEMHD) flows. 1...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that in the liquid state {{eutectic}} alloys are theoretically homogeneous under 1 g conditions. However, the homogeneous solidified structure of this alloy is not obtained because thermal convection and non-equilibrium solidification occur. The present investigators have clarified the solidification mechanisms of the eutectic system alloys under 1 g conditions by using the in situ observation method; in particular, the <b>primary</b> <b>crystals</b> of the eutectic system alloys never nucleated in the liquid, but instead did so on the mold wall, and the crystals separated from the mold wall by fluid motion caused by thermal convection. They also found that the equiaxed eutectic grains (eutectic cells) are formed on the <b>primary</b> <b>crystals.</b> In this case, the leading phase of the eutectic must agree with the phase of the <b>primary</b> <b>crystals.</b> In space, no thermal convection occurs so that <b>primary</b> <b>crystals</b> should not move from the mold wall and should not appear inside the solidified structure. Therefore no equiaxed eutectic grains will be formed under microgravity conditions. Past space experiments concerning eutectic alloys were classified into two types of experiments: one with respect to the solidification mechanisms of the eutectic alloys and the other to the unidirectional solidification of this alloy. The former type of experiment has the problem that the solidified structures between microgravity and 1 g conditions show little difference. This is why the flight samples were prepared by the ordinary cast techniques on Earth. Therefore it is impossible to ascertain whether or not the nucleation and growth of <b>primary</b> <b>crystals</b> in the melt occur and if <b>primary</b> <b>crystals</b> influence the formation of the equiaxed eutectic grains. In this experiment, hypo- and hyper-eutectic aluminum copper alloys which are near eutectic point are used. The chemical compositions of the samples are Al- 32. 4 mass%Cu (Hypo-eutectic) and Al- 33. 5 mass%Cu (hyper-eutectic). Long rods for the samples are cast by the Ohno Continuous Casting Process and they show the unidirectionally solidified structure. Each flight and ground sample was made of these same rods. The dimensions of all samples are 4. 5 mm in diameter and 23. 5 mm in length. Each sample is put in a graphite capsule and then vacuum sealed in a double silica ampoule. Then the ampoule is put in the tantalum cartridge and sealed by electron beam welding. For onbard experiments, a Continuous Heating Furnance (CHF) will be used for melting and solidifying samples under microgravity conditions. Six flight samples will be used. Four samples are hypo-eutectic and two are hyper-eutectic alloys. The surface of the two hypo-eutectic alloy samples are covered with aluminum oxide film to prevent Marangoni convection expected under microgravity conditions. Each sample will be heated to 700 C and held at that temperature for 5 min. After that the samples will be allowed to cool to 500 C in the furnace and they will be taken out of the furnace for He gas cooling. The heating and cooling diagrams for the flight experiments are shown. After collecting the flight samples, the solidified structures of the samples will be examined and the mechanisms of eutectic solidification under microgravity conditions will be determined.
