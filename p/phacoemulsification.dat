2500|$|Extracapsular {{cataract}} extraction (ECCE) {{consists of}} removing the lens manually, but leaving {{the majority of}} the capsule intact. The lens is expressed through a 10- to 12-mm incision which is closed with sutures at the end of surgery. ECCE is less frequently performed than <b>phacoemulsification,</b> but can be useful when dealing with very hard cataracts or other situations where emulsification is problematic. Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS) has evolved from ECCE. In MSICS, the lens is removed through a self-sealing scleral tunnel wound in the sclera which, ideally, is watertight and does not require suturing. Although [...] "small", the incision is still markedly larger than the portal in phacoemulsion. This surgery is increasingly popular in the developing world where access to <b>phacoemulsification</b> is still limited.|$|E
2500|$|Femtosecond laser mode-locking, {{used during}} {{cataract}} surgery, was originally used to cut accurate and predictable flaps in LASIK surgery, {{and has been}} introduced to cataract surgery. [...] The incision at the junction of the sclera and cornea and the hole in capsule during capsulorhexis, traditionally made with a handheld blade, needle, and forceps, are dependent on skill and experience of the surgeon. Sophisticated three-dimensional images of the eyes {{can be used to}} guide lasers to make these incisions. [...] can also then break up the cataract as in <b>phacoemulsification.</b>|$|E
50|$|A Cochrane Review {{seeking to}} {{determine}} whether glaucoma surgery combined with cataract surgery via <b>phacoemulsification</b> has any advantages over cataract surgery (via <b>phacoemulsification)</b> alone found that eyes that underwent combined (glaucoma and <b>phacoemulsification)</b> surgery had a significantly lower intraocular pressure (-1.62 mmHg) compared to eyes that underwent <b>phacoemulsification</b> cataract surgery alone. The authors note that this finding is not conclusive, as the studies examined had many differences and poor reporting outcomes.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the basic}} {{techniques}} of cataract nucleofractis (fragmentation and removal), divide and conquer is among the safest approaches to <b>phacoemulsification</b> and cataract removal. Its safety is reflected in being among the first techniques of <b>phacoemulsification</b> taught to ophthalmology residents and beginner surgeons around the world. It consists of fashioning two orthogonal and deep central grooves in the crystalline lens nucleus, followed by mechanical fracturing of the cataract with the <b>phacoemulsification</b> probe and second instrument. This effectively divides the cataract into four quadrants that are more easily removed by <b>phacoemulsification.</b> Gimbel initially proposed this technique in 1991.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phacoemulsification</b> is {{the most}} {{commonly}} performed cataract procedure in the developed world. However, {{the high cost of}} a <b>phacoemulsification</b> machine and of the associated disposable equipment means that ECCE and MSICS remain the most commonly performed procedure in developing countries.|$|E

50|$|Before the <b>phacoemulsification</b> can be performed, {{one or more}} incisions {{are made}} in the eye to allow the {{introduction}} of surgical instruments.

When Optikon, an Italian manufacturer of ophthalmological equipment, toured India with a <b>Phacoemulsification</b> machine for promotional purposes, Mehta bought the equipment from them and visited USA to receive training on <b>phacoemulsification</b> under William F.

In 2000, he founded Mehta International Eye Institute, attached to the Colaba Eye Hospital, for advanced research on ophthalmology, which has since been awarded the Big Brand Research Service Excellence Award for the Best Eye Hospital in Mumbai in 2011. He also established Netra Rukshak Rural Eye Hospital, a charity hospital in Karjat, a small village with tribal people as majority population.

50|$|The {{continuous}} curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC) {{has been}} crucial to modern cataract surgery. It consists {{of making a}} small circular opening on the anterior surface of the crystalline lens to facilitate subsequent <b>phacoemulsification</b> and cataract removal. This technique constitutes a marked improvement from the previous can-opener capsulorhexis, where multiple small anterior capsular tears were connected. By providing a smooth, continuous surface that resists radial extension, the CCC significantly improved the safety and ease of <b>phacoemulsification,</b> effectively popularizing it. Gimbel employed this technique as early as 1983, and published his landmark description of it in 1991, along with Thomas Neuhann.|$|E
5000|$|Two main {{types of}} {{surgical}} procedures are in common use throughout the world. The first procedure is <b>phacoemulsification</b> (phaco) {{and the second}} involves {{two different types of}} extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE). In most surgeries an intraocular lens is inserted. Foldable lenses are generally used for the 2-3mm phaco incision, while non-foldable lenses are placed through the larger extracapsular incision. The small incision size used in <b>phacoemulsification</b> (2-3mm) often allows [...] "sutureless" [...] incision closure. ECCE utilises a larger incision (10-12mm) and therefore usually requires stitching, and this in part led to the modification of ECCE known as manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS).|$|E
5000|$|The {{surgical}} procedure in <b>phacoemulsification</b> for removal of cataract involves {{a number of}} steps. Each step must be carefully and skillfully performed {{in order to achieve}} the desired result. The steps may be described as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Phacoemulsification</b> is {{a modern}} {{cataract}} surgery in which the eye's internal lens is emulsified with an ultrasonic handpiece and aspirated from the eye. Aspirated fluids are replaced with irrigation of balanced salt solution to maintain the anterior chamber.|$|E
