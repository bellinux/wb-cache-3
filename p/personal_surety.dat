5000|$|The Company {{had never}} succeeded in {{generating}} share subscriptions {{to carry out}} its construction. There were two strong personalities on the Board, William Chambers and John Barrow, and it was their <b>personal</b> money and <b>sureties</b> that allowed any expenditure at all. At a shareholders' meeting in February 1863 all other directors were voted off, and friends and relatives of John Barrow were elected as Directors. However there had not been a quorum at the meeting, and the decision was therefore supposedly in vain. Now the question arose of reimbursement of cash put forward by the two principals {{in the interests of the}} company, and allegations of financial impropriety were laid. By August 1863 the whole business was settled, with William Chambers leaving the Board and John Barrow and his friends took over. The accounts for the period prior to this episode were clouded with controversy, but more pressing were two facts: that expenditure greatly exceeded income; and all the calls on the issued shares had been made. Moreover the next section of construction was to be the most challenging in engineering terms, involving two tunnels together [...] miles, and an exceptionally large viaduct.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1979, Barker became {{engaged to}} James Brandon (a Roanoke businessman). They met in Nassau {{while he was}} working on a book titled [...] "Simply Beautiful", and they later married. On 28 August 1986 James Brandon was arrested on charges of [...] "conspiracy, mail and {{bankruptcy}} fraud and interstate transportation of stolen property". Barker and Brandon appeared together in court over the affair, and co-signed a $75,000 <b>personal</b> <b>surety</b> bond which ensured Brandon's release from custody.|$|E

50|$|Ye Htoon {{was under}} {{detention}} {{for the first}} time from 1962 to 1963 for alleged participation in the 7 July Upheaval. He was arrested again from November 1971 to July 1972 for his connection with Burmese expatriates and foreign firms, and action was taken against him the third time in January 1975 for participation in {{what has come to be}} known as the U Thant crisis, student-led protests over the shabby treatment by the Ne Win government of the remains of U Thant which were crushed by the military government, when he was given a 10-year prison term. He was freed in July 1980 under the Government's Amnesty Order No. 2180. He was detained in June 1986, accused of involvement in illegal dollar transaction, but was freed two weeks later under a <b>personal</b> <b>surety.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{course of}} time the natural {{associations}} get loosened and intermixed, and this calls forth the elaborate legislation of the later Anglo-Saxon kings. Regulations are issued about the sale of cattle {{in the presence of}} witnesses. Enactments about the pursuit of thieves, and the calling in of warrantors to justify sales of chattels, are other expressions of the difficulties attending peaceful intercourse. <b>Personal</b> <b>surety</b> groups appears as a complement of and substitute for more collective responsibility. The hlaford and his hiredmen are an institution not only of private patronage, but also of supervision for the sake of laying hands on malefactors and suspected persons. The landrica assumes the same part in a territorial district.

5000|$|The Company's money {{shortage}} {{meant that}} little real progress {{seems to have}} taken place; perhaps the Company's management focus had been on Parliamentary work on extensions. In July 1866 the banking firm of Overend, Gurney and Company failed, and this triggered a financial crisis; many people lost large amounts of money, and obtaining share subscriptions for new construction became, for a time impossible. The Bristol and North Somerset Company found that raising finance was now impossible, and the Company [...] "collapsed". At a shareholders' meeting on 4 May 1867, the Board disclosed that the Company was {{now in the hands of}} creditors. Moreover, of the authorised share capital of £275,000, only £16,080 of shares had been applied for and issued; more had been given free to unfortunate suppliers and contractors in payment. Individual Directors had given <b>personal</b> <b>surety</b> for Company borrowings in the amount of £180,000; this was twice the authorised quantum. The liabilities were said to amount to £300,000, and sums expended could not be made to equate to work actually completed. The Company Secretary John Bingham became embroiled in claims of improper dealings. The [...] "collapse" [...] of the Company was complete.|$|E
40|$|In several {{continental}} Western European legal systems, {{a person}} may be liable in person or through his property for payment of a debt which is not his. Both <b>personal</b> <b>surety</b> and a pledge which has been alienated by its owner come to mind. Under such circumstances, the question rises whether a creditor can attach the surety or the pledge before seeking payment from the debtor. According to classical Roman law, the creditor {{had a right to}} choose. However, emperor Justinian changed the law in this regard, forcing the creditor to first seek recourse against his debtor, {{even to the point of}} insolvency proceedings. This rule later became known as the ‘beneficium ordinis’ or ‘beneficium excussionis / discussionis’. Over the ages, the rule has come under severe attack, which resulted in it either being abandoned or modified, so as not to interfere with creditors’ rights. The author tracks these developments through the medieval European ‘ius commune’ into French law, Roman-Dutch law and modern Dutch law. The latter has extended the rule in 1992 for real security interests, while at the same time abandoning it for sureties. It is asserted that this was a mistake and the rule should be abolished entirely. Promotor: W. J. ZwalveWith Summary in Germa...|$|E
40|$|As of {{the second}} half of the sixteenth century, bills of {{exchange}} gained importance in commercial finance. Consequently, the use of this legal technique also gave rise to debates in the courts of law of the Southern Low Countries. Regularly, law professors and other learned lawyers were asked for their opinion on complex legal questions regarding those bills of exchange. In their consilia, authors tried to apply the learned law (ius commune) which they studied and taught at the universities, to legal practice. Nevertheless, they also took into account statutory and customary law, and even moral theological treatises. Some of these consultations were – in most cases posthumously – published in printed volumes, thus also becoming a source of law for the debates in the seventeenth century, both in the Spanish Low Countries and in the Dutch Republic. These contemporary sources of ‘learned legal practice’ offer us an excellent insight into some of the most pressing legal issues of commercial and financial practice in the late sixteenth century. The current paper proposes a discussion of some of those consilia on the basis of three short capita selecta. (i) A first section deals with the legal status of a drawee-acceptant of a bill of exchange. It will be discussed how Johannes Wamesius (1524 - 1590), based on mercantile practice (ex more mercatorum), interpreted the acceptance by the drawee as a consent to a delegation (delegatio) with all that that entails. Once accepted, a drawee could no longer revoke his acceptance, as the Brabantian lawyer Henricus Kinschotius (1541 - 1608) argued, even if the drawer did not respect his own obligations. Interestingly, he compared the drawee to a <b>personal</b> <b>surety</b> (fideiussor). (ii) The second section analyzes debates on the alleged usurious nature of certain practices regarding bills of exchange, like the sale of a bill of exchange at a discount before its date of maturity. Particular attention will also be paid to the permissibility of an incrementum retournii or ritorno in bills of exchange drawn in Antwerp and payable at one of the Lyons fairs. (iii) Finally, the paper discusses two consilia by the famous law professor and diplomat Elbertus Leoninus (1520 - 1598) on aleatory contracts, cloaked as security agreements in order to guarantee a certain exchange rate. Those consilia particularly entailed discussions on the way of setting the rate of exchange at the Lyons fairs. status: accepte...|$|E
