500|$|On 2 April, Spector sent {{each of the}} Beatles an acetate of the {{completed}} album with a note saying: [...] "If there is anything you'd like done to the album, let me know and I'll be glad to help … If you wish, <b>please</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> about anything regarding the album tonight." [...] All four of the band members sent him their approval by telegram.|$|E
500|$|On November 20, 2016, soon before {{abruptly}} {{ending a}} concert prematurely he said, [...] "Jay Z—call me, bruh. You still ain't called me. Jay-Z, I know you got killers. Please don't send them at my head. <b>Please</b> <b>call</b> <b>me.</b> Talk {{to me like}} a man." [...] The following day, he was committed to the UCLA Medical Center with hallucinations and paranoia. Contrary to what early reports said, however, West was not actually taken to the hospital involuntarily; he was persuaded to do so by authorities. While the episode was first described as one of [...] "temporary psychosis" [...] caused by dehydration and sleep deprivation, West's mental state was abnormal enough for his 21 cancelled concerts to be covered by his insurance policy; he was reportedly paranoid and depressed throughout the hospitalization, but remains formally undiagnosed. The Paris robbery of his wife may have triggered the paranoia. On November 30, West was released from the hospital.|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course I mean it. And, if {{you don't}} mind, <b>please</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Jims. Nobody calls me James but Aunt Augusta. She isn't my whole aunt. She is just Uncle Walter's half-sister. He is my whole uncle." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, I'm {{not ashamed}} of it," [...] {{explained}} Anne, [...] "only I like Cordelia better. I've always imagined that my name was Cordelia--at least, I always have of late years. When I was young I used to imagine it was Geraldine, but I like Cordelia better now. But if you call me Anne <b>please</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Anne spelled with an E." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank you; but <b>please</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Marie in future. There are no mesdemoiselles in France now, and I shall {{call you}} Elise instead of Madame. And Harry, {{would you mind}} telling the girls that I will meet them to-morrow instead of this evening. I long to see them, oh so, so much; but I should not like to leave {{him for a moment}} now. I fear so that his memory might go again if he were to wake and miss me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} it will be better; and will you <b>please</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Vincent? It is much shorter and pleasanter using our first names; and as we must pass for brother and sister, if we get among the Yankees, it is better to get {{accustomed}} to it. I quite agree with you that it will be too dark to find our way through the woods unless we can discover a path. Dan and I will see if we can find one. If we can, I think it will be better to go on a little way at any rate, so as to get our feet warm and let our clothes dry a little." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel very}} much better now," [...] {{the girl said}} when she had finished. [...] "I believe I was faint from want of food before, {{although}} I {{did not think of}} it. I am sure I could go on walking now. It was not the pain that stopped me, but simply because I didn't feel as if I could lift my foot from the ground. And there is one thing I want to say: I wish you would not call me Miss Armstrong, it seems so formal and stiff, when you are running such terrible risks to save me. <b>Please</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Mary, and I will call you Harry. I think I heard you tell my father your name was Harry Blunt." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'You mistake me, Selah,' Ronald put in hastily, {{with his}} quaint gravity. 'I mean it {{merely as a}} sign of {{confidence}} and a mark of Christian friendship. Sisters call their brothers by their Christian names, don't they? So there can be no harm in that, surely. It {{seems to me that if}} you <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Mr. Le Breton, you're putting me on the footing of a man merely; if you <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Ronald, you're putting me on the footing of a brother, which is really a much more harmless and unequivocal position for me to stand in. Do, <b>please,</b> Selah, <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Ronald.' ...|$|R
6000|$|He walked northward {{without a}} plan, without suspicion, quite in the {{direction}} his little New York friend, in her restless ramble, had taken {{a day or two}} before. He reached, like Milly, the Regent's Park; and though he moved further and faster he finally sat down, like Milly, from the force of thought. For him too in this position, be it added--and he might positively have occupied the same bench--various troubled fancies folded their wings. He had no more yet said what he really wanted than Kate herself had found time. She should hear enough of that in a couple of days. He had practically not pressed her as to what most concerned them; it had seemed so to concern them during these first hours but to hold each other, spiritually speaking, close. This at any rate was palpable, that there were at present more things rather than fewer between them. The explanation about the two ladies would be part of the lot, yet could wait with all the rest. They were not meanwhile certainly what most made him roam--the missing explanations weren't. That was what she had so often said before, and always with the effect of suddenly breaking off: [...] "Now <b>please</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> a good cab." [...] Their previous encounters, the times when they had reached in their stroll {{the south side of the}} park, had had a way of winding up with this special irrelevance. It was effectively what most divided them, for he would generally, but for her reasons, have been able to jump in with her. What did she think he wished to do to her?--it was a question he had had occasion to put. A small matter, however, doubtless--since, when it came to that, they didn't depend on cabs good or bad for the sense of union: its importance was less from the particular loss than as a kind of irritating mark of her expertness. This expertness, under providence, had been great from the first, so far as joining him was concerned; and he was critical only because it had been still greater, even from the first too, in respect to leaving him. He had put the question to her again that afternoon, on the repetition of her appeal--had asked her once more what she supposed he wished to do. He recalled, on his bench in the Regent's Park, the freedom of fancy, funny and pretty, with which she had answered; recalled the moment itself, while the usual hansom charged them, during which he felt himself, disappointed as he was, grimacing back at the superiority of her very [...] "humour," [...] in its added grace of gaiety, to the celebrated solemn American. Their fresh appointment had been at all events by that time made, and he should see what her choice in respect to it--a surprise as well as a relief--would do toward really simplifying. It meant either new help or new hindrance, though it took them at least out of the streets. And her naming this privilege had naturally made him ask if Mrs. Lowder knew of his return.|$|E

6000|$|... 'No, not flattering,' Herbert answered, smiling; 'not flattering, Selah, simply truthful. You always extort {{the truth}} from me with your sweet face, Selah.
