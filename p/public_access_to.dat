5|$|In the Late Classic {{there appears}} to have been greater <b>public</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the acropolis, with {{stairways}} communicating between the various terraces leading up to the south range. During the Terminal Classic, these stairways were filled in, as were many of the access doorways to the acropolis itself, with some buildings being sealed completely. This closing of <b>public</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the palace reflects the greater political instability engulfing the entire Petén region at this time. The acropolis complex was abandoned by the city's elite in the Terminal Classic, a time when most of the city centre was also deserted by its residents. Many flint projectile points were recovered from the south terraces of the acropolis, this combined with the remains of two individuals very near the surface indicates that a violent confrontation took place around the time that the city was abandoned.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role played by {{international}} legal treaties, conventions and agreements that are binding on South Africa, in promoting the <b>public’s</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> medicines. In greater detail the impact that the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) of 1994, the Convention on Biological Diversity of 1992, and the United States of America’s Bahy-Dole Act of 1980 have had in the development of South Africa intellectual property (IP) law is examined. In addition, a question regarding whether such international legal instruments have positively impacted the <b>public’s</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> medicines is considered. The paper concludes that compliance with international IP law rules is not a silver bullet that will solve South Africa’s challenges relating <b>to</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> medicines. The protection of the <b>public’s</b> right <b>to</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> medicines in South Africa is strongly dependent on the government’s political will of ensuring that IP law is implemented to serve public good and public and private pharmaceutical patent holders are held accountable regarding the socially-responsible utilization of their IP...|$|R

Subsequently, the state of Penang passed the Freedom of Information bill on 4 November 2011, allowing the <b>public</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> state documents.

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, the Cabinet War Rooms became {{redundant}} {{and were}} abandoned. Their maintenance became the responsibility of the Ministry of Works. In March 1948 the question of <b>public</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the War Rooms was raised in Parliament and the Minister responsible, Charles Key MP, considered that 'it would not be practicable to throw open for inspection by the general public accommodation which forms part of an office where confidential work is carried on'. Even so, a tour was organised for journalists on 17 March, with members of the press being welcomed by Lord Ismay and shown around the Rooms by their custodian, Mr. George Rance.|$|E
5|$|As of May 2017, {{there are}} 18 Local Nature Reserves in Northamptonshire, {{and there is}} <b>public</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> all sites. Twelve are managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire, and two are also Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Ramsar internationally {{important}} wetland sites, and Special Protection Areas under the European Union Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds. The largest site is Titchmarsh Nature Reserve at , which has nationally important numbers of goosanders, wigeons and gadwalls in winter. The smallest is Great Oakley Meadow, which has prominent surviving ridge and furrow from the medieval ploughing system.|$|E
5|$|During the Late Classic {{there was}} greater <b>public</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the acropolis; as {{the threat of}} warfare grew during the Terminal Classic (AD 800-900), access became much more restricted. The end of formal {{occupation}} {{of the city in}} the Terminal Classic appears to have been violent, with evidence of a battle recovered during excavations of the acropolis. Refugees appear to have occupied the city centre immediately after the collapse of formal settlement at La Blanca, but they abandoned the city for good in the 11th century, after which it was never reoccupied.|$|E

5|$|Following {{complaints}} from local media over {{limited access to}} Goldschmidt's public papers stored at the Oregon Historical Society (OHS), the state archivist announced May 29 that Goldschmidt would seize the 256 boxes of documents to guarantee public access as defined in a state law passed in 1973. That law required that <b>public</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> such records be maintained, but did not specify where the records be kept. Following Goldschmidt's decision to put the documents {{in the care of}} the OHS, the state legislature passed a law requiring future governors to leave their documents in the state archives. Many records were published on the state archives' Web site in early 2005.|$|E
5|$|In June 2009, the National Trust {{announced}} plans to reclad the monument {{at a cost of}} £4 million. The painted fence was replaced by an open wire fence in 2010, aiding visibility, but still denying <b>public</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the base of the monument. Survey work in 2010 showed the extent of cracks in the stonework. In 2013 it was announced that further funding would be needed for the restoration project. Sensors recording the movement of the tower are also to be installed.|$|E
5|$|Namely {{the country}} has been ranked 85th (of 196 countries), and the 2011 Freedom House report noted {{improvement}} of applicable legislation reflecting Croatia's accession to the EU, yet pointed out instances of politicians' attempts to hinder investigative journalism and influence news reports contents, difficulties regarding <b>public</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> information, and that most of print media market is controlled by German-owned Hanza Media and Austrian-owned Styria Media Group. Amnesty International reports that in 2009 in Croatia there was {{an increase in the number}} of physical attacks and murders of journalists. The incidents were mainly perpetrated against journalists investigating war crimes and organised crime.|$|E

5|$|This species {{grows in}} at least 2 {{distinct}} sub-populations, {{both of which are}} well protected by Sabah National Parks Authority. One of the populations grows in an area <b>public</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> which is strictly prohibited without permit. However, there has been a decline in population of mature individuals in the better known and less patrolled site. This is largely due to damage to habitat and plants by careless visitors rather than organised collection of plants. Nepenthes rajah has become common in cultivation in recent years {{as a result of the}} availability of inexpensive clones from tissue culture. I believe that these days commercial collection of this species from the wild is negligible.|$|E
5|$|CNN {{reported}} {{that at least}} two men and altogether five persons set themselves on fire after pouring gasoline over themselves. They did not see a child among the self-immolators. The CNN crew began filming the events from a distance, but were quickly intercepted by military police, who detained the journalists and confiscated their equipment. The authorities then put out the flames consuming the other four people's clothing. A police van came to collect the badly burnt man, and two ambulances arrived almost 25 minutes later to collect the other four. The square was completely closed, and security was tight the next day, the most important of the traditional Chinese holidays. Police monitored <b>public</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the square for the New Year celebrations, had fire extinguishers ready, and prevented Falun Gong practitioners from opening banners.|$|E
5|$|Following the Olympics, {{there was}} extermely {{limited access to}} the {{waterways}} through the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, and reconstruction of Carpenters Road Lock was delayed. However, the £1.8 million project to rebuild it and fit new radial gates was almost completed by May 2017, when the new gates were craned into position. The Heritage Lottery Fund provided £680,000 towards {{the cost of the}} project, with other grants coming from the London Legacy Development Corporation and the Inland Waterways Association. As well as acting as a lock, the radial gates allow water to be distributed around the Bow Back Rivers for flood prevention purposes. The gates were due to be tested during the summer months, with a formal opening scheduled for the East London Waterways Festival in August. <b>Public</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the waterways around the Olympic Stadium was also due to begin in June or July.|$|E
