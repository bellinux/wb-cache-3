In an interview four days before his death MalcolmX said, [...] "I'm man enough to tell you that I can't <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> exactly what my philosophy is now, but I'm flexible."

Entertainment Weeklys Matt Diehl calls Method Man's and Redman's lyrics [...] "misogynistic", {{adding that it}} upsets Voodoos [...] "organically sensual vibe". The introspective track [...] "The Line" [...] has a downtempo, spiritual sound with lyrics about dealing with some unnamed adversity. According to one critic, it [...] "could be about his MIA status ('Will I hang or get left hangin?/Will I fall off or is it bangin?/I say it's up to God'), or about anyone facing doubters with a revolver loaded with talent and self-confidence ('I'm gonna <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> the trigger/I'm gonna pull it, and then we gon' see/What the deal/I'm for real')". Music critic Robert Christgau interpreted the lyrics to be [...] "unjudgmental, unsentimental ... in which {{a young black man}} lays out the reasons he's ready to die-leaving the listener to wonder why the fuck he should have to think about it". Andy Peterson of The GW Hatchet viewed that the adversity is [...] "the price of fame" [...] or [...] "lamenting a lost lover".|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline a [...] "much less extreme reversal" [...] of the season two episode [...] "The Story on Page One", in which Peter {{attempts}} to seduce actor Luke Perry. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "It was disappointing to see Family Guy bury a guest star like Kaitlin Olson in the background for much of her episode as Quagmire's sister last week, but it was even worse {{to see the show}} waste Ryan Reynolds." [...] He continued, [...] "He may not fit an empirical definition of a movie star, but I think he’s worth more as a guest than a tired trope like playing himself as a sexual predator towards Peter." [...] McFarland also criticized the episode's two storylines, noting, [...] "Both plots paint themselves into a corner with no time to get out. In the third act, Stewie is trapped at Consuela's house and Peter hadn't succumbed to Reynolds' repetitive and slowly escalating advances or done anything about them, so the show snaps its fingers and ends each one prematurely." [...] He graded the episode as a C-. In a much more positive review, Terron R. Moore of Ology criticized the episode for not featuring Griffin family siblings Chris and Meg, but praised the series for adopting a Stewie-centric storyline. Moore noted of the storyline involving Reynolds, [...] "All pretty funny stuff, but Ryan Reynolds' entire guest slot is {{based on the fact that}} you like Ryan Reynolds and his occasionally homoerotic humor, which I can definitely appreciate." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "Not the best Family Guy, but a definite improvement on the week before, using some of the elements it knows best." [...] Andy Neuenschwander of Yidio also gave mixed reaction to the episode, writing, [...] "Something happens whenever a celebrity shows up on [...] "Family Guy" [...] and plays themselves. I can't quite <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> it, but everything just feels a bit off. This episode, which featured Ryan Reynolds as Ryan Reynolds, only confirmed that feeling." [...] He also compared it to The Simpsons, noting, [...] "Maybe it's the way the celebrity is treated as a character: in shows like The Simpsons, celebrities who play themselves appear as a relatively normal version of themselves [...] But on Family Guy, celebrities tend to appear as some bizarro version of themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote that [...] "Timothy Dalton was everything {{we had come}} to expect from him in the part: scary and dangerous and then so much the funnier for the way he kept trying to work the steps and turn over a new leaf. The episode left 's sincerity up in the air for most of the hour - was he really serious about making amends, or just trying to distract Chuck from his latest evil plan? - but Volkoff is such a well-drawn character, and Dalton so talented and versatile, that the comedy worked either way... Vivian, on the other hand? I'd been iffy on her in her most recent appearance, and putting her on camera with , even briefly, was just a reminder of how much less she brings to the table." [...] Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A-. Though he praised Dalton's performance, McGee wrote, [...] "The direct parallels between Chuck and Vivian haven't really panned out in the way the show initially envisioned it. Let's face it: These two aren't exactly Buffy and Faith in terms of being foils for one another. The show has never painted Chuck as ever potentially going to the dark side. It has used Casey and occasionally Sarah to serve that function at times, but never Chuck. At this point, he's as set in his moral code as possible. Had the Vivian storyline happened at the outset of his Intersect 2.0 days, perhaps the taste of power could have gone to his head, with Vivian {{as an example of the}} road not taken. As such, Vivian's existence largely serves to connect her to the larger spy world of the show, not draw a direct parallel to the support system that helped Chuck overcome any potential temptations." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8 out of 10, writing, [...] "This Chuck got off to a shaky start. I don't know how to <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> it exactly, but the pacing felt off in the first third or so of the episode... Thankfully, things picked up considerably as the episode went along – I'd say the turning point was the scene in which Chuck was sent in to meet with the pirates. The way Chuck's big announcement that he worked for Alexei Volkoff immediately led to a bunch of guns pulled on him was funny, as was not only Chuck asking to play Uno (for his life), but that the pirate did indeed have the game." [...] Carl Cortez of Assignment X, however, gave the episode a negative review, calling it [...] "a painfully nonsense driven episode that's now grasping at straws in an attempt to round out the last part of the season with an adequate storyline." ...|$|E

Felt like I should be doing something important, but couldn't <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> it." [...] This was interpreted by several Team USA players and personnel, including Dean Lombardi, John Tortorella, David Backes, Zach Parise, and Derek Stepan as Kessel jabbing following his snub.

2500|$|Therefore, I beseeched the Lord {{to teach}} me His statutes. After my prayer as usual I opened my Bible with closed eyes and <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> the right place.

[...] And again I opened the Bible, that time on 1 Timothy 1:15"This is a {{faithful}} saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus {{came into the world}} to save sinners; of whom I am chief." [...] And for the third time I tempted the Lord, saying: [...] "O Lord! I am not an Abraham nor a Jew, I'm a sinner, but involve me to understand Your Will." [...] And then I opened the Book of SirahJoshua 24:29-30, where I read in the new American Translation: [...] "Said to myself, I will water my plants, my flower bed I will drench; and suddenly this rivulet of mine became a river, then this stream of mine, a sea. Thus do I send my teaching forth shining like a dawn, to become known afar off. Thus do I pour out instruction like prophecy and bestow it on generations to come." ...|$|E

Nobody bid against me but Godwin, the broker, and it was knocked down to me for twenty-two and six.

60|$|It was a {{dense and}} damp spruce and fir wood {{in which we}} lay, and, except for our fire, {{perfectly}} dark; and when I awoke in the night, I either heard an owl from deeper in the forest behind us, or a loon from a distance over the lake. Getting up some time after midnight to collect the scattered brands together, while my companions were sound asleep, I observed, partly in the fire, which had ceased to blaze, a perfectly regular elliptical ring of light, about five inches in its shortest diameter, six or seven in its longer, and from one eighth to one {{quarter of an inch}} wide. It was fully as bright as the fire, but not reddish or scarlet like a coal, but a white and slumbering light, like the glowworm's. I saw at once that it must be phosphorescent wood, which I had often heard of, but never chanced to see. <b>Putting</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> it, with a little hesitation, I found that it was a piece of dead moosewood which the Indian had cut off in a slanting direction the evening before.|$|R

In one account afterwards, Bell said [...] "As soon as I saw him, I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> right <b>on</b> his face and said, 'I know him; that was the man.'"

6000|$|Secondly, {{you speak}} very sensibly of the melodramatic and clap-trap [...] element in Hugo.

Whatever other difference there might be among them, I got, in time, to notice, among those who were particularly wicked and unquestionably guilty, one point in which they all resembled each other. Tall and short, old and young, handsome and ugly, they all had a secret self-possession that nothing could shake. On the surface they were as different as possible. Some of them were in a state of indignation; some of them were drowned in tears; some of them were full of pious confidence; and some of them were resolved to commit suicide before the night was out. But only put your <b>finger</b> suddenly <b>on</b> the weak point in the story told by any one of them, and there was an end of her rage, or her tears, or her piety, or her despair; and out came the genuine woman, in full possession of all her resources with a neat little lie that exactly suited the circumstances of the case.

6000|$|About noon {{we saw a}} thin, high smoke to the southward, such a smoke as {{a burning}} house will make in sunshine, and Sikandar Khan, {{who knows how to}} take a bearing across a hill, said, [...] "At last we have burned the house of the pumpkin-seller whence they signalled." [...] And I said: [...] "What need now that they have slain my child? Let me mourn." [...] It was a high smoke, and the old man, as I saw, came out into the {{verandah}} to behold it, and shook his clenched hands at it. So we lay till the twilight, foodless and without water, for we had vowed a vow neither to eat nor to drink till we had accomplished the matter. I had a little opium left, of which I gave Sikandar Khan the half, because he loved Kurban Sahib. When it was full dark we sharpened our sabres upon a certain softish rock which, mixed with water, sharpens steel well, and we took off our boots and we went down to the house and looked through the windows very softly. The old man sat reading in a book, and the woman sat by the hearth; and the idiot lay on the floor with his head against her knee, and he counted his fingers and laughed, and she laughed again. So I knew they were mother and son, and I laughed, too, for I had suspected this when I claimed her life and her body from Sikandar Khan, in our discussion of the spoil. Then we entered with bare swords.... Indeed, these Boer-log do not understand the steel, for the old man ran towards a rifle in the corner; but Sikandar Khan prevented him with a blow of the flat across the hands, and he sat down and held up his hands, and I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> lips to signify they should be silent. But the woman cried, and one stirred in an inner room, and a door opened, and a man, bound about the head with rags, stood stupidly fumbling with a gun. His whole head fell inside the door, and none followed him. It was a very pretty stroke--for a Pathan. They then were silent, staring at the head upon the floor, and I said to Sikandar Khan, [...] "Fetch ropes! Not even for Kurban Sahib's sake will I defile my sword." [...] So he went to seek and returned with three long leather ones, and said, [...] "Four wounded lie within, and doubtless each has a permit from a General," [...] and he stretched the ropes and laughed. Then I bound the old man's hands behind his back, and unwillingly--for he laughed in my face, and would have <b>fingered</b> <b>my</b> beard--the idiot's. At this the woman with the swine's eyes and the jowl of a swine ran forward, and Sikandar Khan said, [...] "Shall I strike or bind? She was thy property on the division." [...] And I said, [...] "Refrain! I have made a chain to hold her. Open the door." [...] I pushed out the two across the verandah into the darker shade of the thorn-trees, and she followed upon her knees and lay along the ground, and pawed at my boots and howled. Then Sikandar Khan bore out the lamp, saying that he was a butler and would light the table, and I looked for a branch that would bear fruit. But the woman hindered me not a little with her screechings and plungings, and spoke fast in her tongue, and I replied in my tongue, [...] "I am childless to-night because of thy perfidy, and my child was praised among men and loved among women. He would have begotten men--not animals. Thou hast more years to live than I, but my grief is the greater." ...|$|R
