40|$|Within {{the master}} thesis a {{computational}} model of biaxial tension test of soft biological tissues was developed. The tested specimen can be attached using clamps or hooks. The {{number and the}} size <b>of</b> <b>clamps</b> and hooks {{have a significant impact}} on the distribution of stress and strain in the centre of the specimen, where deformation is measured. Using the developed computational model, a sensitivity analysis of number and size <b>of</b> <b>clamps</b> and hooks and a sensitivity analysis <b>of</b> placement <b>of</b> <b>clamps</b> was elaborated. The number and size <b>of</b> <b>clamps</b> and hooks were optimized in such a way that the material’s parameters obtained by the tension test correspond to the utmost to the actual parameters of the material. By analyzing the placement <b>of</b> <b>clamps,</b> the influence <b>of</b> selected deviations on the outcome of the tension test was determined.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{influence}} <b>of</b> small <b>clamping</b> eccentricity on the measurement {{and evaluation of}} involute profile, analyzes the cause <b>of</b> <b>clamping</b> eccentric error, establishes a clamping eccentric error compensation model, and introduces a computing method <b>of</b> <b>clamping</b> eccentric parameters. Experimental testing of the computing method <b>of</b> <b>clamping</b> eccentric parameters proves that the computing method <b>of</b> <b>clamping</b> eccentric parameters is correct and feasible when the clamping eccentric value is within {{three quarters of the}} measurement range of the probe. The results <b>of</b> the <b>clamping</b> eccentricity error compensation experiment show that the clamping eccentric error compensation model can compensate measurement results to the results attained under operating conditions, and achieve precision measurement of involute profiles. The highest allowed clamping eccentric value can be extended to three quarters of the measurement range of the probe by the clamping eccentricity error compensation model proposed in this paper, thereby saving time otherwise spent adjusting for clamping eccentricity...|$|R

40|$|By the Moore’s law of {{technology}} scaling and Bell’s Law of prediction {{on the next}} generation small form factor computer class, the mm-scale sensor nodes are widely {{considered to be the}} next generation of computer class. With the limited size of the sensor nodes, the capacity of the battery is extremely small or can be even battery less. Therefore, the ultra-low power design technique is critical for those sensor nodes to sustain reasonable lifetime. Among all the building blocks of those sensor nodes, <b>power</b> consumption <b>of</b> analog parts benefits least from the technology scaling compared to the digital and the memory counterparts and widely becomes the dominant part <b>of</b> the <b>power</b> consumption <b>of</b> the system. Therefore, this thesis is focus on bringing down the <b>power</b> consumption <b>of</b> the analog circuits. The following techniques are described in this thesis with the order: First, an advanced sample and hold technique for bandgap voltage reference to duty-cycled the blocks and reducing the power consumption is presented. Second, a technique for reducing leakage <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the ESD <b>clamp</b> circuits by addressing both GIDL leakage and subthreshold leakage is presented.
