50|$|Other issues {{affecting}} lethality are frequency, {{which is an}} issue in causing cardiac arrest or muscular spasms. Very high frequency electric current causes tissue burning, but does not penetrate the body far enough to cause cardiac arrest (see electrosurgery). Also important is the pathway: if the current passes through the chest or head, there is an increased chance of death. From a main circuit or <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>panel</b> the damage {{is more likely to}} be internal, leading to cardiac arrest. Another factor is that cardiac tissue has a chronaxie (response time) of about 3 milliseconds, so electricity at frequencies of higher than about 333 Hz requires more current to cause fibrillation than is required at lower frequencies.|$|E

The 256 P RAX uses only 184 lines PSTN subscribers but if we convert it into ANRAX it uses 248 lines PSTN subscribers through V 5. 2 protocol. The 256 P RAX consists of three racks, they are: 1) <b>Power</b> <b>Distribution</b> <b>Panel</b> (PDP), 2) Master Frame & 3) Slave Frame.

To do the conversion of 256 P RAX some of the cards become redundant and those cards have to be removed. Then the modification will be done for the 256 P RAX. The conversion and installation procedure is completely done in five steps. The main objective for converting the 256 P RAX we can have the maximum lines for the exchange...|$|E

50|$|There is {{very little}} {{information}} about early Serge power supplies, but Serge soon settled upon commercial Power One supplies set for +/-12v. Some first generation modules also required a +6v supply, initially provided by a 6v regulator on the supply but as these modules became fewer the regulators were mounted near the modules before dying out completely around 1980. The n-voice controller was unique in requiring a supply with an additional 5v rail. At some point, Condor supplies were used instead - these were almost identical to Power One supplies. Early supplies used a 4 pin Cinch Jones type connector, but sometime in the mid/late 1970s these were superseded by 5 pin XLR connectors. <b>Power</b> <b>distribution</b> in Serge <b>panels</b> were never {{as good as it}} perhaps should have been, but gradual improvements were made - distribution modules being introduced in the mid 1970s and the STS black panel for m-modules in recent times.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{two-phase}} <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> {{scheme for}} supporting quality-of-service (QoS) and best effort traffic is proposed. We first formulate the <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> for QoS traffic as an optimization problem {{so that the}} number of simultaneously transmitting connections is maximized. Optimum <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> is difficult to implement in practice due to both the computational complexity and the requirement for global information about the mobile station (MS) locations, connection channel conditions, and traffic load in the system. We then propose a heuristic scheme of <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> for soft handoff (SHO) connections. The full scheme includes an initial <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> (IPD) and a <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> adjustment (PDA). IPD allocates BS power resource based on the channel condition of each individual connection, while PDA further coordinates the <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> between neighboring base stations (BSs) in order to accommodate more connections. The proposed <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> scheme can achieve a capacity close to that of the optimum <b>power</b> <b>distribution,</b> while providing much higher transmission throughput for best effort data traffic. The proposed <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> scheme can be applied to existing SHO schemes for efficient BS power resource usage. The scheme does not require global information, and its implementation can be further simplified by performing IPD only with slight performance degradation.

Two types of interdigitated and paired <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grids {{with multiple}} supply voltages and multiple grounds are presented. Analytic models are also developed to estimate the loop inductance in four types of proposed power delivery schemes. Two proposed schemes, fully and pseudo-interdigitated power delivery, reduce power supply voltage drops as compared to conventional interdigitated <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> systems with dual supplies and a single ground by, on average, 15. 3 % and 0. 3 %, respectively. The performance of the proposed on-chip <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grids is compared to a reference <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grid with a single supply and a single ground. The voltage drop in fully interdigitated and fully paired <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grids with multiple supplies and multiple grounds is reduced, on average, by 2. 7 % and 2. 3 %, respectively, {{as compared to the}} voltage drop of an interdigitated <b>power</b> <b>distribution</b> grid with a single supply and a single ground.
