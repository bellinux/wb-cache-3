Fires in the engine compartment are to be detected and extinguished within 10 seconds to minimize vehicle damage. In addition, the driver also has access to a small <b>portable</b> <b>fire</b> extinguisher. Fixed fuel tanks are self-sealing, mounted externally and shielded by the JLTV structure. Each crew seat has a combined seat and blast restraint device. Ingress time for a crew of four in combat equipment is 30 seconds or less. Egress with B-kit doors is within 10 seconds.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{official}} {{standard in the}} United States for the color of fire extinguishers, though they are typically red, except for class D extinguishers which are usually yellow, water and Class K wet chemical extinguishers which are usually silver, and water mist extinguishers which are usually white. Extinguishers are marked with pictograms depicting the types of fires that the extinguisher is approved to fight. In the past, extinguishers were marked with colored geometric symbols, and some extinguishers still use both symbols. The types of fires and additional standards are described in NFPA 10: Standard for <b>Portable</b> <b>Fire</b> Extinguishers, 2013 edition.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Puranic cults, {{there were five}} Hindu deities {{known to have been}} worshipped in Sogdiana. These were Brahma, Indra, Mahadeva (Shiva), Narayana, and Vaishravana; the gods Brahma, Indra, and Shiva were known by their Sogdian names Zravan, Adbad and Veshparkar, respectively. Durga, a mother goddess in Shaktism, may be represented in Sogdian art as a four-armed goddess riding atop a lion.

He also invented a device intended to save people who had fallen through ice.|$|R
2500|$|Only a {{small number}} of people were at the {{airstrip}} and saw the crash. [...] The airport groundsman and an airline staff member grabbed <b>portable</b> <b>fire</b> extinguishers, jumped into a car and raced across the airstrip. Others at the airstrip and nearby beaches ran towards the burning aircraft. [...] The aircraft's cabin door had been torn away by a tree stump and lay about [...] behind the aircraft but despite the open doorway no-one inside the passenger cabin attempted to escape. [...] Fuel floating {{on the surface of the}} water was burning fiercely, making it dangerous to approach the wreckage. One of the first witnesses to reach the scene believed he saw two people at the front of the passenger cabin who were alive but before he could get close enough to investigate he was driven back by flames.|$|E
2500|$|A {{fire engine}} from Coolangatta arrived {{within minutes of}} the crash. [...] The boggy swamp made it {{difficult}} to manoeuvre the vehicle close to the wreckage. [...] Firemen initially attacked the fire with <b>portable</b> <b>fire</b> extinguishers and then used the fire engine to pump water from the swamp onto the blazing wreckage. [...] Two firemen found a way around the burning fuel {{on the surface of the}} water and climbed onto the wing with their hose. The fire burned fiercely for 30 minutes but was not completely extinguished for another hour. Apart from the outer wings and the tail section, little of the aircraft was recognisable. [...] Both halves of the tailplane were visibly bent downwards. [...] The wreckage of the wings and engine mounts also showed they had suffered severe downward bending indicating the severity of the impact. The charred body of one of the pilots was half-way out a cockpit window, suggesting he survived the crash and attempted to escape from the wreckage.|$|E
2500|$|Trimethoxyboroxine(TMB)liquid is a boron {{compound}} {{dissolved in}} methanol {{to give it}} proper fluidity {{and allow it to}} be discharged from a <b>portable</b> <b>fire</b> extinguisher. It was developed in the late 1950s by the U.S. Navy for use on magnesium fires, especially crashed aircraft and aircraft wheel fires from hard landings. It is unique as an extinguishing agent in that the agent itself is a flammable liquid. When TMB contacts the fire, the methanol ignites and burns with a greenish flame due to the boron. As the methanol burns off, a glassy coating of boric oxide is left {{on the surface of the}} metal, creating an air-excluding crust. These extinguishers were made by the Ansul Chemical Co. utilizing TMB agent manufactured by the Callery Chemical Company, and were modified 2.5-gallon water extinguishers (Ansul used re-branded Elkhart extinguishers at the time), with a variable-stream nozzle that could deliver a straight stream or spray at the squeeze of a lever. A 6-inch fluorescent orange band with the letters [...] "TMB" [...] stenciled in black identified TMB from other extinguishers. This agent was problematic in that it had a shelf life of only six months to a year once the extinguisher was filled, since the methanol is extremely hygroscopic (absorbs moisture from the air), which causes corrosion to the extinguisher and renders its use on fire dangerous. These extinguishers were used from the 1950s–70s in various applications, such as the MB-1 and MB-5 crash trucks. The current SOP is to use water fog and cool/burn out the burning metal.|$|E
5|$|The <b>portable</b> {{electric}} <b>fire</b> engine {{would be}} efficient and practical only if {{a supply of}} electricity was available in a city for this purpose. An argument against {{the high cost of}} such an electrical installation was that the cost would be lower in a city or district where there was already an infrastructure set up to power electric lighting and electrical railways. The same current supply could be used for the electric fire engine system.|$|R
5000|$|In Japan, the Tokyo Fire Department uses {{pairs of}} {{motorcycle}} units nicknamed [...] "Quick Attackers" [...] for fire-fighting, rescue and {{medical first aid}} treatment. The units comprise two 200cc bikes operating - a 'type T' unit {{is equipped with a}} <b>portable</b> impulse <b>fire</b> extinguishing system, while a 'type U' unit carries simple rescue equipment and fire extinguishers. As of 2001, 20 Quick Attacker teams were in service.

Mendoza responded with a bolt-action, single-shot design with a short barrel and simple metal sled that could be moved easily by two men or carried on horseback. By August 6, 1915, the first cannons were ready and proved very successful. Eventually, some 75 were made and used by the revolutionaries.

40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of water mist fire suppression technology has made substantial progress {{over the last}} decade. Water mist based techniques are becoming popular but the fire extinguishment products call for high initial investment. There exists a need to develop cost effective water mist generation techniques appropriate for fire suppression. A standard <b>portable</b> water-CO 2 <b>fire</b> extinguisher nozzle is selected for study with an application density of 1. 0 l/min/m 2. A multi-jet nozzle with opposed jet configuration is developed to get improved spray characteristics. Droplet Sauter Mean Diameters (SMD) were empirically calculated using correlations available in the literature. The spray developed has resulted in droplets with SMD {{in the range of}} 0. 3 – 0. 4 mm as calculated from correlations and confirmed using experimental measurements...|$|R
