The bizarre case involved {{the son of}} a wealthy Nashville business owner who had disappeared in September 1931, followed six weeks later by the disappearance of his secretary. Seigenthaler was sent to Texas by The Tennessean after reports surfaced that Buntin (now known as Thomas D. Palmer) was living somewhere in the Lone Star state. After a series of dead-ends, Seigenthaler struck <b>pay</b> <b>dirt</b> in Orange, Texas, where he saw an elderly man step off a bus.

After three further days of investigation, {{he went back to the}} home, where he confirmed the identities of Buntin/Palmer, his wife, the former Betty McCuddy, and their six children. Seigenthaler won a National Headliner Award for the story.|$|E

Heather Richels of The Paly Voice complimented its hook and catchiness, while deeming {{it the most}} appealing song of the album. While reviewing The Onyx Hotel Tour, Pamela Sitt of The Seattle Times called it the album's strongest single. Eric Olsen of msnbc.com said the song could be the biggest hit of In the Zone, while calling it [...] "powerfully addicting." [...] Caryn Ganz of Spin commented that, [...] "Spears hits <b>pay</b> <b>dirt</b> on 'Toxic'". Christy Lemire of Associated Press said {{it was one of}} Spears' greatest hits and deemed it as [...] "insanely catchy", saying that the chorus alone [...] "makes you want to forgive the Alias wannabe video that accompanies the song." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called it along with [...] "Showdown", [...] "irresistible ear candy in what is surely Britney's most ambitious, adventurous album to date". In a separate review of Spears' greatest hits album [...] (2004), Erlewine selected it as one of the [...] "track picks" [...] and described it as [...] "a delirious, intoxicating rush". Jeffrey Epstein of Out compared the innovative sound of [...] "Toxic" [...] to Madonna's [...] "Vogue".|$|E

5000|$|Mitchell also {{chaired the}} Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee. Under Mitchell's {{chairmanship}} the committee {{began to look}} at allegations of corruption and wide-scale tax evasion in the banking sector, particularly regarding Deposit interest retention tax (DIRT). It was established {{that there was a}} culture of encouraging tax evasion within Irish banks, which had allowed wealthy customers to set up non-resident (off-shore, international) bank accounts into which money was transferred, enabling the account holder to avoid <b>paying</b> <b>DIRT.</b> The scandal resulted Allied Irish Banks being forced to reach a settlement of €90 million with the Revenue Commissioners in respect of DIRT evasion in 2000 in addition to thousands of tax-evaders being prosecuted including the former Minister for Justice Pádraig Flynn. The Mitchell inquiry was [...] "shocked and horrified" [...] at the [...] "careless and reckless" [...] manner in which the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland had quoted false statistics to the Public Accounts subcommittee.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1990s a {{parliamentary}} inquiry under Jim Mitchell, TD, established {{the existence of}} a culture of encouraging tax evasion within Irish banks, which had allowed wealthy customers to set up non-resident (off-shore, international) bank accounts into which money was transferred, enabling the account holder to avoid <b>paying</b> <b>DIRT.</b> (Such accounts in theory should only have been set up by foreign investors, who would of course pay any tax due to their local authorities.) Thousands of tax-evaders were prosecuted as were leading banks, producing hundreds of millions of Irish pounds of the Irish Exchequer through financial settlements and fines. Several famous Irish people have been found evading the tax, including (former) Minister for Justice Pádraig Flynn.The Committee was of the view that the Central Bank of Ireland had an inappropriate and outmoded approach to supervision {{in the context of the}} growing sophistication of banking and the changing role of banks. It also found there was an insufficient concern with ethics and supervision other than from the standpoint of a traditional and narrow concern with prudential supervision in the Central Bank. The Chairman of the inquiry was [...] "shocked and horrified" [...] at the [...] "careless and reckless" [...] manner in which the Governor had quoted false statistics to the Public Accounts subcommittee.|$|R

5000|$|Because {{the gold}} in the California gravel beds was so richly concentrated, the early forty-niners simply panned for gold in California's rivers and streams, a form of placer mining.
