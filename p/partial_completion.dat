Two additional projects were considered in the report but not recommended for immediate work: a circumferential route which would reappear years later as the Urban Ring, and an extension of Tremont Street Subway through service from Lechmere to Woburn via the Lowell Line.|$|E

[...] Instead of oo-koo-hé they found fields full of gigantic Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms, which became the new focus of the expedition. In La Chorrera, {{at the urging of}} his brother, McKenna {{was the subject of a}} psychedelic experiment in which the brothers attempted to bond harmine (harmine is another psychedelic compound they used synergistically with the mushrooms) with their own neural DNA, through the use of a set specific vocal techniques. They hypothesised this would give them access to the collective memory of the human species, and would manifest the alchemists’ Philosopher’s Stone which they viewed as a [...] "hyperdimensional union of spirit and matter". McKenna claimed the experiment put him in contact with [...] "Logos": an informative, divine voice he believed was universal to visionary religious experience. The voice's reputed revelations and his brother's simultaneous peculiar psychedelic experience prompted him to explore the structure of an early form of the I Ching, which led to his [...] "Novelty Theory".|$|E

40|$|In the {{occlusion}} illusion, {{the visible}} {{portion of a}} partly occluded object (e. g., a half circle partly hidden behind a rectangle) appears to be significantly larger than a physically identical region that is fully visible. This illusion may occur either because the visual system “fills in ” a thin strip along the occluded border (the <b>partial</b> modal <b>completion</b> hypothesis) or because the partly occluded object is perceived as farther away (the apparent distance hypothesis). We measured {{the magnitude of the}} occlusion illusion psychophysically in several experiments to investigate its causes. The results of Experiments 1 - 3 are consistent with the general proposal that the magnitude of the illusion varies with the strength of the evidence for occlusion, supporting the inference that it is due to occlusion. Experiment 4 provides a critical test between apparent distance and <b>partial</b> modal <b>completion</b> explanations by determining whether the increase in apparent size of the occluded region results from a change in its perceived shape (due to the occluded shape’s modal extension along the occluding edge, as predicted by the <b>partial</b> modal <b>completion</b> hypothesis) or from a change in its perceived overall size (as predicted by the apparent distance hypothesis). The results more strongly support the partial modal completio...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} two Colleges {{designed by}} the nineteenth century architect William Wardell (1823 - 99) : St John’s College, within the University of Sydney (1858 - 59) and Convent and School, Kew, now known as Genazzano FCJ College Kew, Melbourne (1889). The approach of significant anniversaries {{for each of the}} Colleges has been the major impetus behind the current research. Both commissions demonstrate laudable aspirations; difficulty in comprehending and realising the design; <b>partial</b> <b>completions</b> and accretions over time which testify to changes in economic fortune and taste; inappropriate additions; and decades of neglect fuelled by a general misunderstanding of the 19 th century for much of the 20 th century.

Using the two Colleges as case studies, this paper examines tradition and its transformation, design and its translation, heritage and its significance. <br /...|$|R

40|$|A partial matrix over a {{field is}} a matrix whose entries are either {{elements}} of the field or independent indeterminates. A <b>completion</b> of a <b>partial</b> matrix is any matrix that results from assigning a field element to each indeterminate. The set of <b>completions</b> of a <b>partial</b> matrix forms an affine subspace of the corresponding space of matrices. This thesis investigates partial matrices whose sets of completions satisfy particular rank properties - specifically <b>partial</b> matrices whose <b>completions</b> all have ranks that are bounded below and <b>partial</b> matrices whose <b>completions</b> {{all have the same}} rank. The maximum possible number of indeterminates in such partial matrices are determined and the partial matrices that attain these bounds are fully characterized for all fields. These characterizations utilize a duality between properties of affine spaces of matrices that are related by the trace bilinear form. Precise conditions (based on field order, rank and size) are provided to determine if a <b>partial</b> matrix whose <b>completions</b> all have the same rank r must possess a square partial sub-matrix of order r whose completions are all nonsingular. Finally a characterization of maximal nonsingular partial matrices is provided - a maximal nonsingular partial matrix is a square partial matrix each of whose completions has full rank, with the property that replacement of any constant entry with an indeterminate results in a partial matrix having a singular completion...|$|R

In this paper, {{we are interested}} in N-matrix completions problems, that is, when a partial N-matrix has an N-matrix completion. In general, a combinatorially or non-combinatorially symmetric partial N-matrix does not have an N-matrix completion. Here, we prove that a combi-natorially symmetric partial N-matrix has an N-matrix completion if the graph of its specified en-tries is a 1 -chordal graph.

Short-term and long-term sequential patterns can be extracted and combined to generate music with various styles by our method.

Our method shows about 88 % of success rate in <b>partial</b> music <b>completion</b> task. By inspecting hyperedges in the trained hypernetworks, we can extract a set of arguments that constitutes melodic structures in music. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Quasi Delay Insensitive {{asynchronous}} logic {{is a very}} robust system allowing safe implementations while requiring min-imal timing assumptions. Unfortunately the design methodologies using this system have always yielded very slow designs. Early output logic is a method which aims to improve the performance of QDI circuits without decreasing their robustness. In order to force QDI restrictions on early output circuits a form of guarding is necessary. This paper presents {{a new form of}} guarding which allows <b>partial</b> stage <b>completion</b> allowing de-synchronisation of inputs. This is shown to be highly advanta-geous in cases where the previous style performed poorly. Because the two styles can be mixed, the designs no longer suffer from very poor performance of some QDI constructions. I...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} it is not {{possible}} to UV-complete certain low-energy effective theories with spontaneously broken space-time symmetries by embedding them into linear sigma models, that is, by adding "radial" modes and restoring the broken symmetries. When such a UV completion is not possible, one can still raise the cutoff up to arbitrarily higher energies by adding fields that transform non-linearly under the broken symmetries, that is, new Goldstone bosons. However, this (<b>partial)</b> UV <b>completion</b> does not necessarily restore any of the broken symmetries. We illustrate this point by considering a concrete example in which a combination of space-time and internal symmetries is broken down to a diagonal subgroup. Along the way, we clarify a recently proposed interpretation of inverse Higgs constraints as gauge-fixing conditions. Comment: 6 page...|$|R
