40|$|We {{consider}} {{the dynamics of}} `nonlinear tent maps': piecewise smooth unimodal maps with nowhere vanishing derivative. We show that if a nonlinear tent map $f$ is not infinitely renormalizable, then all its periodic orbits of sufficiently high period are hyperbolic repelling. If additionally all periodic orbits of $f$ are hyperbolic, then $f$ has at most finitely many <b>periodic</b> <b>attractors</b> {{and there is a}} hyperbolic expansion outside the basins of these <b>periodic</b> <b>attractors.</b> In particular, if a nonlinear tent map $f$ is not infinitely renormalizable and all its periodic orbits are hyperbolic repelling, then some iterate of $f$ is expanding.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{extensive}} numerical experiments of the spatially periodic initial value {{problem for the}} Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. This paper {{is concerned with the}} asymptotic nonlinear dynamics at the dissipation parameter decreases and spatio-temporal chaos sets in. To this end the initial condition is taken to be the same for all numerical experiments (a single sine wave is used) and the large time evolution of the system is followed numerically. Numerous computations were performed to establish the existence of windows, in parameter space, in which the solution has the following characteristics as the viscosity is decreased: a steady fully modal attractor to a steady bimodal attractor to another steady fully modal attractor to a steady trimodal attractor to a <b>periodic</b> <b>attractor,</b> to another steady fully modal attractor, to another <b>periodic</b> <b>attractor,</b> to a steady tetramodal attractor, to another <b>periodic</b> <b>attractor</b> having a full sequence of period-doublings (in parameter space) to chaos. Numerous solutions are presented which provide conclusive evidence of the period-doubling cascades which precede chaos for this infinite-dimensional dynamical system. These results permit a computation of the length of subwindows which in turn provide an estimate for their successive ratios as the cascade develops. A calculation based on the numerical results is also presented to show that the period doubling sequences found here for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, are in complete agreement with Feigenbaum's universal constant of 4, 669201609 [...] .. Some preliminary work shows several other windows following the first chaotic one including periodic, chaotic, and a steady octamodal window; however, the windows shrink significantly in size to enable concrete quantitative conclusions to be made...|$|E

40|$|Motivated by {{bouncing}} {{motion of}} an inelastic particle on a vibrating board, a simple two-dimensional map is constructed and its behavior is studied numerically.

40|$|The {{existence}} of a special periodic window in the two-dimensional parameter space of an experimental Chua's circuit is reported. One {{of the main reasons}} that makes such a window special is that the observation of one implies that other similar periodic windows must exist for other parameter values.

Herewith we present a study on the dynamics of dissipative systems close to the Hamiltonian limit, emphasising the increasing number of <b>periodic</b> <b>attractors</b> and on the structural changes in their basin boundaries as the dissipation approaches zero. We show numerically that a power law with nontrivial exponent describes the growth {{of the total number of}} <b>periodic</b> <b>attractors</b> as the damping is decreased. We also establish that for small scales the dynamics is governed by effective dynamical invariants, whose measure depends not only on the region of the phase space, but also on the scale under consideration. Therefore, our results show that the concept of effective invariants is also relevant for dissipative systems. Comment: 9 pages, 10 figures. Accepted and in press for PR...|$|R
40|$|A new {{learning}} algorithm for {{the storage}} of static and <b>periodic</b> <b>attractors</b> in biologically inspired recurrent analog neural networks is introduced.

Standing or traveling wave cycles may be stored to mimic the kind of oscillating spatial patterns that appear in the neural activity of the olfactory bulb and prepyriform cortex during inspiration and suffice, in the bulb, to predict the pattern recognition behavior of rabbits in classical conditioning ex-periments.
