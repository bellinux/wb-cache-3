5|$|Following a brief {{military}} career, including {{service in}} the American Civil War, he became a successful entrepreneur and commercial photographer. His photographic work was highly regarded, particularly his hand-coloured <b>portraits</b> <b>and</b> landscapes, which he sold mostly to foreign residents and visitors to the country.|$|E
5|$|Hunter {{painted a}} variety of still-lifes, landscapes and <b>portraits,</b> <b>and</b> his {{paintings}} are critically acclaimed for their treatment of light {{and the effects of}} light.

5|$|Dietrich Wildung {{proposed}} that the bust in Berlin was a model for official <b>portraits</b> <b>and</b> {{was used by the}} master sculptor for teaching his pupils how to carve the internal structure of the eye, and thus the left iris was not added. Gardner's Art Through the Ages and Silverman presents a similar view that the bust was deliberately kept unfinished. Hawass suggested that Thutmose had created the left eye, but it was later destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{continued}} to produce paintings ranging from still lifes to formal <b>portraits,</b> <b>and</b> to attract both admiration for his technique and criticism for supposed obscenity, {{until his death}} in 1849. In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, and his works fetched huge sums on resale. Changing tastes from the 1870s onwards meant history paintings in Etty's style fell rapidly out of fashion, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century, the value of all of his works had fallen below their original prices.|$|E
5|$|George V disliked {{sitting for}} <b>{{portrait}}s</b> <b>and</b> despised modern art; {{he was so}} displeased by one portrait by Charles Sims that he ordered it to be burned. He did admire sculptor Bertram Mackennal, who created statues of George for display in Madras and Delhi, and William Reid Dick, whose statue of George V stands outside Westminster Abbey, London.|$|E

5|$|In 1607, {{after the}} death of Leonard Fryer, Peake was {{appointed}} serjeant-painter to King James I, sharing the office with John De Critz, who had held the post since 1603. The role entailed the painting of original <b>portraits</b> <b>and</b> their reproduction as new versions, to be given as gifts or sent to foreign courts, as well as the copying and restoring of portraits by other painters in the royal collection.|$|E

Michael Ely directed the Secret Project movies and cast the faction leaders. 25 volunteers participated in Firaxis' first public beta test. The beta testers suggested the Diplomatic and Economic victories and the Random Events.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{appear in}} art, either to {{illustrate}} their botanical appearance, {{or for the}} purposes of the artist, which may include decoration or religious symbolism. For example, the Virgin Mary was compared by the Venerable Bede to a lily, the white petals denoting purity of body, while the yellow anthers signified the radiant light of the soul; accordingly, European portraits of the Virgin's Annunciation may depict a vase of white lilies in her room to indicate her attributes. Plants are also often used as backgrounds or features in <b>portraits,</b> <b>and</b> as main subjects in still lifes.|$|E

5|$|The {{house was}} insured in 1857 for £10,000 (£ today); the {{contents}} {{at that time}} included books and wines (insured for £2,250), mathematical and musical instruments (£250), and pictures (£1,000). The art collection included several family <b>portraits</b> <b>and</b> other works by Sir Joshua Reynolds, which were saved from the fire that gutted the building early in January 1866. Extensive restoration work for Hungerford Crewe was completed in 1870.|$|E
5|$|Artists were {{classified}} as artisans since they were nonagricultural laborers who manufactured and decorated objects. The philosopher Wang Fu argued that urban society exploited the contributions of food-producing farmers while able-bodied men in the cities wasted their time (among other listed pursuits) crafting miniature plaster carts, earthenware statues of dogs, horses, and human figures of singers and actors, and children's toys. However, during Eastern Han some scholar-officials began engaging in crafts originally reserved for artisans, such as mechanical engineering. Emperor Ling commissioned the official Cai Yong (132192 CE) to paint <b>portraits</b> <b>and</b> produce eulogies for five generations of the prominent Yang clan of officials and military officers. This is the first recorded instance in China where a scholar-official was commissioned to write eulogies and paint portraits in conjunction, instead of relying on skilled artisans to do the painting.|$|E

5|$|Despite his wealth, he was {{not known}} for a lavish life. His court of about a hundred people was not known for being overly extravagant, he built no luxurious residences, and did not even have a single {{portrait}} of himself made during his life. It is uncertain how Wiśniowiecki looked, although a number of <b>portraits</b> <b>and</b> other works depicting him exist. Jan Widacki notes {{that much of the}} historiography concerning Wiśniowiecki focuses on the military and political aspects of his life, and few of his critics discuss his successes in the economic development of his estates.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Potts was poorly {{received}} by critics. Etty's admirers were angered by his apparent abandonment of history painting for the then poorly regarded field of portrait painting, while Etty's critics {{felt he had}} demonstrated {{that he did not}} have the technical skills to produce high quality <b>portraits,</b> <b>and</b> was simply trying to use his name to make money in the more lucrative field of portraiture. History paintings were generally sold at exhibition for no less than the asking price, and as a consequence often remained unsold. Portraits were commissioned by the subject or their family, providing a guaranteed source of income to the artist. History painting was much more highly regarded as an art form; portrait painting was seen as reflecting nature whereas history painting involved more creativity and also gave the artist the opportunity to tell moral lessons.|$|E
5|$|Felice Beato (1832 – 29 January 1909), {{also known}} as Felix Beato, was an Italian–British photographer. He {{was one of the}} first people to take {{photographs}} in East Asia and one of the first war photographers. He is noted for his genre works, <b>portraits,</b> <b>and</b> views and panoramas of the architecture and landscapes of Asia and the Mediterranean region. Beato's travels gave him the opportunity to create images of countries, people, and events that were unfamiliar and remote to most people in Europe and North America. His work provides images of such events as the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the Second Opium War, and represents the first substantial body of photojournalism. He had an impact on other photographers, and his influence in Japan, where he taught and worked with numerous other photographers and artists, was particularly deep and lasting.|$|E

5|$|He {{was found}} guilty and punished posthumously for the crime of treason. The Senate had his {{property}} proscribed, forbade mourning on his account, removed images of his likeness, such as statues and <b>portraits,</b> <b>and</b> his name was erased {{from the base of}} one statue in particular as part of his damnatio memoriae. Yet, in a show of clemency not unlike that of the emperor, the Senate had Piso's property returned and divided equally between his two sons, on condition that his daughter Calpurnia be given 1,000,000 sesterces as dowry and a further 4,000,000 as personal property. His wife Placina was absolved.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, Rossier was in Siam, {{where he}} {{assisted}} the French zoologist Firmin Bocourt by taking ethnographic portraits for the latter's scientific expedition of 18611862, and in 1863, Negretti and Zambra issued {{a series of}} 30 stereographic <b>portraits</b> <b>and</b> landscapes taken in Siam that are almost certainly the work of Rossier. In February 1862, Rossier was again in Shanghai, where he sold his cameras and other photographic equipment before embarking for Europe. During his time in Asia {{it is possible that}} Rossier photographed in India; Negretti and Zambra issued a series of views of India {{at about the same time}} as Rossier's China views.|$|E

References are also made to other aspects of the Sangam society. Coins issued by the Tamil kings of this age have been recovered from river beds and urban centers of their kingdoms. Most of the coins carry the emblem of the corresponding dynasty on their reverse, such as the bow and arrow of the Cheras; some of them contain <b>portraits</b> <b>and</b> written legends helping numismatists assign them to a certain period.|$|E
