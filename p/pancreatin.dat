60|$|Section 28. The {{pancreatic}} juice, the secretion of {{the pancreas}} is remarkable as acting {{on all the}} food stuffs that have not already become soluble. It emulsifies fats, that is, it breaks, the drops up into extremely small globules, forming a milky fluid, and it furthermore has a fermentive action upon them; it splits them up into fatty acids, and the soluble body glycerine. The fatty acids combine with alkaline substances (Section 26) to form bodies which belong to the chemical group of Soaps, and which are soluble also. The pancreatic juice also attacks any proteids that have escaped the gastric juice, and converts them into peptones, and any residual starch into sugar. Hence by this stage, in the duodenum, all the food constituents noticed in Section 17 are changed into soluble forms. There are probably, three distinct ferments in the pancreatic juice acting respectively on starch, fat, and proteid, {{but they have not}} been isolated, and the term <b>pancreatin</b> is sometimes used to suggest the three together.|$|E

40|$|Background: Steatorrhea {{following}} major;pancreatic resection can {{be difficult}} to control, requiring high doses of pancreatic enzyme supplements. The aim {{of this study was to}} demonstrate equivalent efficacy of high-dose and standard-dose <b>pancreatin</b> in treating steatorrhea after pancreatectomy. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, crossover study was conducted with a 2 -wk run-in period for stabilization on a suitable dose of standard-dose <b>pancreatin</b> and two 14 -d treatment periods using either high-dose or standard-dose <b>pancreatin</b> at this dosage. Parameters used to demonstrate efficacy of treatment were stool fat excretion, stool volume, and clinical symptoms. Results: Thirty-nine patients who had undergone total or partial pancreatectomy were randomised; 37 completed all parts of the study. During stabilization, the mean daily capsule intake was 19. 4 (range 9 - 54); even so, 22 (56 %) patients had stool fat excretion > 7 g/d. There were significant correlations between stool fat excretion and stool volume (p < 0. 0001) and stool frequency (p < 0. 01), but not with indices of abdominal pain and global symptoms. Both high-dose: and standard-dose <b>pancreatin</b> demonstrated statistically similar efficacy in the treatment period. Conclusion: The use of high-dose <b>pancreatin</b> for the treatment of pancreatic insufficiency in patients following pancreatectomy should significantly reduce capsule intake with increased convenience and greater compliance rate.

The undenatured WPC was produced in a pilot plant by membrane technology (microfiltration/diafiltration) after separation of the casein clot through a conventional process. All three hydrolysates with 20 % degree of hydrolysis showed an amino acid profile similar to WPC. Male A/J mice were fed on diets containing 20 % WPC or hydrolysates. Commercial casein was used as a reference protein in the biological assays. The glutathione content was determined after liver extraction through high-performance capillary electrophoresis. WPC and its <b>pancreatin</b> and protamex hydrolysates showed higher ability to stimulate liver glutathione synthesis than alcalase hydrolysate. This difference was probably related to an amino acid sequence in the peptides that were formed during hydrolysis of whey proteins. Commercial casein and WPC alcalase hydrolysate produced lower stimulation of liver glutathione synthesis (7. 09 and 5. 66 mu mol/g of wet weight) compared with WPC and <b>pancreatin</b> and protamex hydrolysates (8. 72, 8. 71, and 8. 45 mu mol/g of wet weight, respectively).

40|$|In {{pancreatic}} steatorrhoea, both pH-dependent {{bile acid}} precipitation and enzyme inactivation may limit {{the efficacy of}} pancreatic enzyme supplements and both may be preventable by addition of cimetidine. To separate these effects we compared postprandial jejunal aspirate from eight adults with steatorrhoea due to cystic fibrosis on three randomised treatment regimens (<b>pancreatin,</b> cimetidine, and both together). We also compared the results with those of previous studies of patients on no treatment, and of healthy subjects. On <b>pancreatin</b> 60 % of the test meal entered the jejunum at pH less than 5 compared with 17 % in health. Lipase concentration and lipolysis increased over the values on no treatment (14. 2 vs 4. 4 U/l, p less than 0. 01; 16 % vs 11 %, p less than 0. 02) but bile acid precipitation was not reduced (38 % vs 27 %, NS), and aqueous-phase lipid concentration decreased (6. 7 vs 8. 6 mM/l, p less than 0. 05). On cimetidine, bile acid precipitation fell (19 % vs 38 %, p less than 0. 05); although lipase concentration and lipolysis were lower than on <b>pancreatin</b> (4. 8 U/l vs 14. 2 U/l, p less than 0. 01; 9 % vs 16 %, p less than 0. 01) lipid solubilisation increased (8. 8 vs 6. 7 mM/l, p less than 0. 05). On the combination, there was a marked improvement (p less than 0. 02) in lipid solubilisation (18. 3 mM/l), reflecting the improvement both in lipase (38. 4 U/l) and lipolysis (24 %), and in bile acid precipitation (5. 6 %). We conclude that the efficacy of <b>pancreatin</b> is limited by pH-dependent bile acid precipitation in addition to enzyme inactivation.

40|$|A zymographic assay of diamine oxidase (DAO, histaminase, EC 1. 4. 3. 6), {{based on}} a coupled {{peroxidase}} reaction, and its behavior at proteolysis in simulated gastric and intestinal conditions, are described. The DAO activity from a vegetal extract of Lathyrus sativus seedlings was directly determined on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoretic gels containing entrapped horseradish peroxidase, with putrescine as substrate of histaminase and ortho-phenylenediamine as co-substrate of peroxidase. The accumulation of azo-aniline, as peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation product, led to well-defined yellow-brown bands on gels, with intensities corresponding to the enzymatic activity of DAO. After image analysis of gels, a linear dependency of DAO content (Coomassie-stained protein bands) and of its enzymatic activity (zymographic bands) with the concentration of the vegetal extract was obtained. In simulated gastric conditions (pH 1. 2, 37  °C), the DAO from the vegetal extract lost its enzymatic activity before 15  min of incubation, either in {{the presence or absence}} of pepsin.

40|$|Oral {{pancreatic}} enzyme supplements, including those protected from gastric acidity by enteric coating, often achieve only partial correction of pancreatic steatorrhoea. To characterise the mechanisms involved in vivo, eight patients with steatorrhoea due to advanced pancreatic insufficiency and nine healthy controls were studied. Two sets of studies (small bowel intubation and five day faecal fat quantification) were randomly performed while patients were either on enteric coated <b>pancreatin</b> or equivalent placebo. A 260 cm long multilumen tube {{was used for}} double marker perfusion of two 20 cm segments located in the duodenum and in the ileum respectively. Luminal pH, flow, and trypsin and lipase activity outputs were measured at each segment for four hours postcibally. Placebo treated patients with pancreatic steatorrhoea had low enzyme outputs in the duodenal test segment and even lower outputs in the ileal segment. <b>Pancreatin</b> treatment significantly decreased steatorrhoea (p < 0. 05) and increased luminal enzyme outputs (p < 0. 05). The increase was much greater in the ileal than in the duodenal segment. Thus enteric coated <b>pancreatin</b> treatment abolished the normal gradient between postcibal duodenal and ileal lipase output. The results suggest that enteric coated <b>pancreatin</b> nearly corrects severe pancreatic steatorrhoea. The ingested lipase was utilised inefficiently, however, as luminal enzyme activity in the ileum was enhanced {{to a greater extent}} than in the duodenum, and consequently the absorptive potential of the small bowel was only partially utilised...|$|E
40|$|Utilisation of {{microbial}} enzymes {{may represent}} an alternative strategy {{to the use}} of conventional <b>pancreatin</b> obtained from pig pancreas for the treatment of severe pancreatic insufficiency. In this study, we focused on the capacity of two microbial preparations for their capacity to digest alimentary proteins (caseins and soya proteins) in comparison with <b>pancreatin.</b> These microbial enzymatic preparations were found to be able to generate small, medium-size and larger polypeptides from caseins and soya proteins but were inactivated at pH 3. 0. As determined by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry analysis, microbial enzymes generated very different peptides from caseins when compared with peptides generated through <b>pancreatin</b> action. These microbial preparations were characterised by relatively low trypsin- and low carboxypeptidase-like activities but high chymotrypsin-like activities and strong capacity for cleavage of caseins at the methionine sites. Although the efficiency of these microbial preparations to increase the rate of absorption of nitrogen-containing compounds in severe pancreatic insufficiency remains to be tested in vivo, our in vitro data indicate proteolytic capacities of such preparations for alimentary protein digestion...|$|E
