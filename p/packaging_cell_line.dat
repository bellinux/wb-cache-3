The most useful <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> contain helper virus DNA from which the signal required for packaging of the viral RNA genome into virions has been deleted. However, we showed that the ability to package virus is conferred at very low frequency to cells infected with virus from these <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines,</b> presumably by low-frequency transmission of the deleted virus genome. In addition, these <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> can interact with some retroviral vectors to yield replication-competent virus. We constructed <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> containing helper virus DNA that had several alterations in addition to deletion of the packaging signal.

40|$|The locus {{control region}} of the human beta-globin cluster {{consists}} of four major DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS). When linked to globin genes, the locus control region confers {{a high level of}} erythroid-specific expression of these genes in transgenic mice or transfected erythroid <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> We have examined the effect of one of these sites, HS 2, on human beta-globin gene expression in a murine erythroleukemia <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> (MEL) after retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. We incorporated a 732 - or 412 -base-pair (bp) segment of HS 2 in the retroviral construct carrying the human beta-globin gene. These fragments rendered the viruses unstable as the human beta-globin gene was rearranged or deleted in all the <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> examined. On the other hand, when a 36 -bp fragment containing the NFE- 2 /AP- 1 binding consensus in this region was inserted into the retroviral construct, we recovered 6 stable <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> of 12 examined, similar in percentage to the construct with the beta-globin gene alone. The virus titers of the <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> from these two constructs were similar. We infected MEL cells with viruses produced from three <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> of each of the two constructs and measured the ratio of human beta-globin to mouse alpha-globin mRNA after hexamethylenebisacetamide induction.

We have modified the tetracycline-inducible system by fusing the ligand binding domain of the estrogen receptor to the carboxy terminus of a tetracycline-regulated transactivator. Using this system, we show that VSV-G expression is tetracycline-dependent and can be modulated by beta-estradiol.

5000|$|If, in fact, HFV is not {{pathogenic}} {{in humans}} {{and is a}} retrovirus, it is an ideal vector for gene therapy.

[...] Other advantages are human to human transmission has never been reported, it has a safer spectrum of insertional mutagenesis than other retroviruses, and since there are two promoters in the genome, {{it may be possible to}} make a vector that expresses the foreign genes under the control of both promoters. A disadvantage of HFV as a gene therapy vector is that since it buds from an intracellular membrane (endoplasmic reticulum membrane); it results in low extracellular titers of the viral vector.|$|E

40|$|The risk of insertional {{mutagenesis}} inherent to all integrating exogenous expression cassettes was {{the impetus for}} the development of various integration-defective lentiviral vector (IDLV) systems. These systems were successfully employed in a plethora of preclinical applications, underscoring their clinical potential. However, current production of IDLVs by transient plasmid transfection is not optimal for large-scale production of clinical grade vectors. Here, we describe the development of the first tetracycline-inducible stable IDLV <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> comprising the D 64 E integrase mutant and the VSV-G envelope protein. A conditional self-inactivating (cSIN) vector and a novel polypurine tract (PPT) -deleted vector were incorporated into the newly developed stable <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> by transduction and stable transfection, respectively. High-titer (â¼ 107 infectious units (IU) /ml) cSIN vectors were routinely generated. Furthermore, screening of single-cell clones stably transfected with PPT-deleted vector DNA resulted in the identification of highly efficient producer cell lines generating IDLV titers higher than 108 IU/mL, which upon concentration increased to 1010 IU/ml. IDLVs generated by stable producer lines efficiently transduce CNS tissues of rodents. Overall, the availability of high-titer IDLV lentivirus <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> described here will significantly facilitate IDLV-based basic science research, as well as preclinical and clinical applications...|$|E
40|$|Several {{patients}} with severe combined immunodeficiency-X 1 disease and adenosine deaminase deficiency have been cured by retroviral-mediated gene therapy. Despite the earlier success, {{the production of}} retroviral vectors for clinical gene therapy is cumbersome, costly and lacks safety features because of the adherent nature of packaging cells and the necessity to supplement the culture media with bovine serum. The {{aim of this study}} was to generate a retrovirus <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> that could be used for the production of large clinical batch vectors. Bicistronic vectors containing an internal ribosomal entry site followed by a selection gene were used to express Moloney murine leukemia gag-pol and amphotropic envelope viral proteins in HEK 293 cells. The candidate clone (293 GP-A 2) that was selected as the <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> could release recombinant green fluorescent protein retroviruses at 4 times 107 infectious viral particles per ml.

40|$|Previous {{attempts}} to establish 293 cell-based stable and high-titer adeno-associated virus (AAV) <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> were unsuccessful, {{primarily due to}} adenovirus E 1 -activated Rep gene expression, which exerts cytostatic and cytotoxic effects on the host cells. Control of the two large AAV Rep proteins (Rep 78 / 68) was insufficient to eliminate the adverse effects, because of the leaky expression of the two small Rep proteins (Rep 52 / 40). However, it was unsuccessful to control Rep 52 / 40 gene expression since its promoter is located within the coding sequence of Rep 78 / 68. To tightly regulate all four Rep proteins by using their own promoters, we have developed a novel gene control paradigm termed “dual splicing switch,” which disrupts all four Rep genes by inserting into their shared coding region an intron that harbors transcription termination sequences flanked the LoxP sites. As a result, the structure and activities of the Rep gene promoters, both p 5 and p 19, are not affected; however, all of the Rep transcripts are prematurely terminated and the genes were inactivated. Removal of the terminator by Cre protein reactivates the transcription of all four Rep proteins derived from their own promoters. This switch system was initially tested in the lacZ gene and a 600 -fold induction of β-galactosidase activity was observed. Using the dual splicing switch strategy, we have subsequently established a number of AAV <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> from 293 <b>cells,</b> which showed a normal growth rate, high stability, and more importantly, high yields of AAV vectors. Such a gene control paradigm is also useful for other viruses, e. g., autonomous parvoviruses. Finally, the high-titer 293 -based AAV <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> should greatly {{reduce the risk of}} wild-type adenovirus contamination and provide a scalable AAV vector production method for both preclinical and clinical studies...|$|R

When stably transfected with an HIV- 1 -based retroviral vector, the Ψ 422 cell line produces virions capable of transducing CD 4 -positive cells with high efficiency (up to 105 cells per ml).

40|$|To further address safety {{concerns}} of live attenuated viruses as preventive vaccines against HIV infection, a SIV-based single cycle immunodeficiency virus vaccine (SCIV) was developed.

Immunization of rhesus monkeys with SCIVs could stimulate both antibody and cell-mediated immune responses. At the doses used for immunization however, these vaccines could not provide long-term control of the replication of pathogenic SIVs used to challenge the immunized animals. In order to determine if the establishment of <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> for the production of large amount of SCIVs was possible, a SIV-based minimal <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> was generated which could be used to produce up to 10 5 IU/ml of VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviral vectors...|$|E

To achieve expression of the retroviral gag-pol polyprotein, the precise coding sequences for gag-pol were introduced into a vector which utilizes totally nonretroviral signals for gene expression. Because constitutive expression of the VSV-G protein is toxic in 293 cells, we used the tetR/VP 16 transactivator and teto minimal promoter system for inducible, tetracycline-regulatable expression of VSV-G. After stable transfection of the 293 GPG <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> with the MFG. SnlsLacZ retroviral vector construct, {{it was possible to}} readily isolate stable virus-producing cell lines with titers approaching 10 (7) colony-forming units/ml. Transient transfection of 293 GPG cells using a modified version of MFG. SnlsLacZ, in which the cytomegalovirus IE promoter was used to drive transcription of the proviral genome, led to titers of approximately 10 (6) colony-forming units/ml. The retroviral/VSV-G pseudotypes generated using 293 GPG cells were significantly more resistant to human complement than commonly used amphotropic vectors and could be highly concentrated (> 1000 -fold). This new <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> may prove to be particularly useful for assessing the potential use of retroviral vectors for direct in vivo gene transfer.

Using sensitive reverse transcriptase PCR assays, we investigated human and murine gene therapy <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> for incorporation of endogenous retrovirus transcripts into murine leukemia virus (MLV) vector particles and, conversely, whether vector genomes are incorporated into human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) particles. VL 30 endogenous retrovirus sequences were efficiently packaged in particles produced by the murine AM 12 packaging system. For every seven MLV-derived β-galactosidase (β-Gal) vector genomes present in the particles, one copy of VL 30 was also packaged. Although human FLY <b>packaging</b> <b>cells</b> expressed several classes of HERV transcripts (HERV-K, HuRT, type C, and RTVL-H), none was detectable in the MLV vector particles released from the <b>cells.</b> Nonspecific <b>packaging</b> of the MLV Gag-Pol expression vector transcripts was detected in the FLY virions at a low level (1 in 17, 000 sequences). These findings indicate that human <b>packaging</b> <b>cells</b> produce retrovirus particles far less contaminated by endogenous viral sequences than murine <b>packaging</b> <b>cells.</b> Human teratocarcinoma cells (GH cells), which produce HERV-K particles, were transduced with an MLV-derived β-Gal vector.

40|$|The {{adeno-associated virus}} (AAV) vector system {{is based on}} nonpathogenic and helper-virus-dependent parvoviruses. The vector system offers safe, efficient, and {{long-term}} in vivo gene transfer in numerous tissues. Clinical trials using AAV vectors have demonstrated vector safety as well as efficiency. The increasing interest {{in the use of}} AAV for clinical studies demands large quantities of vectors and hence a need for improvement in vector production. The commonly used transient-transfection method, although versatile and free of adenovirus (Ad), is not cost-effective for large-scale production. While the wild-type-Ad-dependent AAV producer <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> seem to be cost-effective, this method faces the problem of wild-type Ad contamination. To overcome these shortcomings, we have explored the feasibility of creating inducible AAV <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> that require neither transfection nor helper virus infection. As a first step toward that goal, we have created a <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> containing highly inducible Ad E 1 A and E 1 B genes, which are essential for AAV production. Subsequently, the AAV Rep and Cap genes and an AAV vector containing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene were stably introduced into the E 1 A-E 1 B <b>cell</b> <b>line,</b> generating inducible AAV-GFP <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> Upon induction of E 1 A and E 1 B genes and infection with replication-defective Ad with E 1 A, E 1 B, and E 3 deleted, the <b>packaging</b> <b>cells</b> yielded high-titer AAV-GFP vectors. Finally, the E 2, E 4, and VA genes of Ad, under the control of their endogenous promoters, were also introduced into these cells. A few producer <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> were obtained, which could produce AAV-GFP vectors upon simple drug induction.

First generation recombinant adenoviruses, rendered defective by deletion of sequences spanning E 1 a and E 1 b, express low levels of early and late viral genes that activate destructive cellular immune responses. Current strategies for improving recombinant adenoviruses attempt to inactivate other essential genes through deletion and growth in new <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> or incorporation of temperature sensitive mutations which allow propagation of the virus in available <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> at permissive temperatures.

This recombinant (called ΔrAd), which contains only the essentialciselements (i. e., ITRs and contiguous packaging sequence), is propagated in 293 cells in the presence of E 1 -deleted helper virus. Concatamers of the monomeric vector genome were passaged and capable of transduction. The ΔrAd genome is packaged into virions that sediment at a lower density than the helper virus in cesium gradients forming the basis for a purification protocol. A fully deleted recombinant adenovirus that expresses human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator was produced and used to transduce human airway epithelial cells derived from a cystic fibrosis patient. Packaging and propagation of a fully deleted adenovirus is an important step toward the development of a safer vector.

40|$|The Fv- 1 b-mediated {{restriction}} of N-tropic retrovirus vector infection of BALB/ 3 T 3 cells was partially abrogated by prior infection with N-tropic {{murine leukemia virus}}. Likewise, abrogation of the Fv- 1 b {{restriction of}} N-tropic murine leukemia virus replication was accomplished by prior infection with genome-deficient virions produced by an N-tropic murine leukemia virus <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>line.</b> The latter observation suggests that the Fv- 1 target in genome-deficient virions abrogates Fv- 1 restriction {{in the absence of}} any viral genome-directed processes...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} described avian leukosis virus-based <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> that produce stocks of retroviral vectors in which replication-competent viruses were not detectable. However, following infection of target cells with these retroviral stocks, we recently obtained colonies {{resulting from the}} transmission of recombinant genomes. Here, we have analyzed their genetic structure and shown that (i) each of them results from recombination between the packaging- and integration-defective transcomplementing genomes and the retroviral vector; (ii) recombination probably occurred during the reverse transcription step, involving strand switching of the reverse transcription growing point from the infectious retroviral vector to the transcomplementing RNA; and (iii) sequence identity and nonhomologous sequences were both used for the strand switching...|$|R
40|$|Novel {{retroviral}} protein expression constructs {{were designed}} to retain minimal retroviral sequences and to express dominant selectable markers by reinitiation of translation after expression of the viral genes. HT 1080 cells were selected as producer cells {{for their ability to}} release high-titer viruses that are resistant to inactivation by human serum. Two HT 1080 -based <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> which produce Moloney murine leukemia virus cores with envelope glycoproteins of either amphotropic murine leukemia virus (FLYA 13 line) or cat endogenous virus RD 114 (FLYRD 18 line) are described. Direct comparison with previous retroviral packaging systems indicated that 100 -fold-higher titers of helper-free recombinant viruses were released by the FLYA 13 and FLYRD 18 lines...|$|R
40|$|Using a model {{recombinant}} retrovirus encoding the Escherichia coli lacZ gene, we {{have found}} that medium conditioned with NIH 3 T 3 <b>cells</b> and <b>packaging</b> <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> derived from NIH 3 T 3 cells inhibits infection. Most of the inhibitory activity was greater than 100 kDa and was sensitive to chondroitinase ABC digestion, which is consistent with the inhibitor being a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Proteoglycans secreted by NIH 3 T 3 cells and purified by anion-exchange chromatography inhibited amphotropic retrovirus infection. Pretreatment of amphotropic retrovirus stocks with chondroitinase ABC boosted the level of transduction efficiency by more than twofold. The implications of these findings with respect to retrovirus-cell interactions and the production of high-titer retroviral stocks are discussed...|$|R
