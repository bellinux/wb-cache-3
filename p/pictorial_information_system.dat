40|$|A {{technique}} is developed {{based on the}} use of a neural network model for performing information retrieval in a <b>pictorial</b> <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> The neural network provides autoassociative memory operation and allows the retrieval of stored symbolic images using erroneous or incomplete information as input. The network used is based on an adaptation of the random neural network model featuring positive and negative nodes and symmetrical behavior of positive and negative signals. The network architecture considered here has hierarchical structure and allows two level operation during learning and recall. An experimental software prototype, including an efficient graphical interface, has been implemented and tested. The performance of the system has been investigated through experiments under several schemes concerning storage and reconstruction of patterns. These schemes are either based on properties of the random network or constitute adaptations of known neural network techniques...|$|E
40|$|Unlike {{alphanumeric}} data, {{multimedia data}} contains embedded information {{which must be}} extracted and interpreted {{before it can be}} used or queried. Our goal is to explore new data models that are capable of representing and processing multimedia data. We propose a new object-oriented data modeling approach called MOODS (Modeling Object-Oriented Data Semantics) that integrates the multimedia data processing component of an information management system with the data modeling technique. MOODS supports three new abstractions that distinguish it from ordinary object-oriented data modeling techniques: dynamic data semantics, function groups, and composition. This paper describes the MOODS approach and shows how the approach can be applied to a <b>pictorial</b> <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> 1 Introduction Historically, a primary role of computers has been to manage data, in particular, alpha-numeric data consisting of numbers and characters.

40|$|Two {{approaches}} for integrating images into {{the framework of}} a database management system are presented. The classi cation approach preprocesses all images and attaches a semantic classi cation and an associated certainty factor to each object found in the image. The abstraction approach describes each object in the image by using a vector consisting of the values of some of its features (e. g., shape, genus, etc.). The approaches di er {{in the way in which}} responses to queries that are based on image content are computed. In the classi cation approach, images are retrieved on the basis of whether or not they contain objects that have the same classi cation as query objects. In the abstraction approach, retrieval is on the basis of similarity of feature vector values of these objects. Both the pattern recognition and indexing aspects of the method are addressed for each approach. The emphasis is on extracting both contextual and spatial information from the raw images. Methods for storing and indexing symbolic images as tuples in a relation are presented for each approach. Indices are constructed for both the contextual and the spatial data. The user interface for a <b>pictorial</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> based on these two approaches is also presented...|$|E

In the second part of the paper, we concentrate on the matters of archiving and retrieving images from large databases, in the case of QVE. An approach is proposed that relies on two concepts, namely relevance and focusof -attention. These mechanisms allow to locate and select the most pertinent information from images. They can be used at the image archival stage, to automatically determine which parts of the image should provide meaningful indices to be compiled into the image access tables.

Chang, Principles of <b>Pictorial</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> Design, Prentice-Hall, New York, 1989. ] However, previous approaches to designing such systems usually ignore relative-metric information on symbolic pictures and cause several deficiencies in indexing, spatial reasoning, and retrieval. In our approach, we extract relative-metric information from symbolic pictures and use such information to help establish indexes based on an improvement from a minimal perfect hashing scheme. As a result, more accurate picture retrieval can be achieved through our indexing mechanism. Capabilities in spatial reasoning and query representation/processing are also improved. By utilizing relative-metric spatial relations, an image database system becomes more flexible and intelligent. (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R

In a cognitive approach, integrating this information involves complex processes constrained by properties of the learner's cognitive system, and especially by the capacity of working memory. This paper, reports on an experiment focused on the integration of verbal and <b>pictorial</b> <b>information</b> when students learn a series of physics concepts. The involvement of the visuo-spatial working memory was investigated {{by means of a}} dual-task paradigm. Results show that <b>pictorial</b> <b>information</b> enhances the learning process.

40|$|Abstract — The {{field of}} Digital Image Processing refers to {{processing}} digital images {{by means of}} digital computer. One of the main application areas in Digital Image Processing methods {{is to improve the}} <b>pictorial</b> <b>information</b> for human interpretation. Most of the digital images contain noise. This can be removed by many enhancement techniques. Filtering is one of the enhancement techniques which is used to remove unwanted information (noise) from the image. It is also used for image sharpening and smoothening. The aim of this project is to demonstrate the filtering techniques by performing different operations such as smoothening, sharpening, removing the noise etc. This project has been developed using Java language because of its universal acceptance and easy understandability. Interest in digital image processing methods stems from two principal application areas:- improvement of <b>pictorial</b> <b>information</b> for human interpretation; and processing of image data for storage, transformation, and representation for autonomous machine perception Index Terms—Digital Image processing, Filltering techniques...|$|R
40|$|Verbal and <b>pictorial</b> <b>information</b> {{are often}} {{processed}} together. Therefore, knowing {{how and when}} information from these modalities is integrated is important. In this ERP study we investigated integration of <b>pictorial</b> <b>information</b> into a sentence context. Right-handed participants heard sentences containing manual action verbs (e. g. “You are slicing the tomato”), while seeing {{a picture of a}} manual action. Pictures matched or mismatched the sentence content and the participants’ handedness (i. e. pictures showed a left or right-handed perspective). Results showed a larger N 400 -amplitude for content-mismatching than for content-matching sentence-picture pairs. The N 400 -amplitude was not larger when the picture mismatched the participants’ handedness. However, participants responded faster to right than to left-handed perspective pictures. This study suggests that with a sentence context, pictures are integrated with verbal information, but mental simulations either do not play a role in this process or this role might be too small to be visualised in the N 400...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the architecture of}} a system that retrieves images on the basis of <b>pictorial</b> <b>information</b> as opposed to systems based on textual and numerical retrieval. The pictorial approach is motivated from the observation {{that the majority of the}} <b>pictorial</b> <b>information</b> in an image cannot be fully described by textual or numerical information due to its essential limitations in expressive power. Therefore, we propose that the search is carried out from a pictorial specification (i. e. a set of pictorial details and their relationships) where the correspondence is established between the pictorial specification and the images in the database. The method is based on fuzzy Mathematical Morphology operations. In this paper we concentrate on MRI images of the chest. Experiments have been carried out on a database of those images show encouraging results especially when realizing that the content of medical images is a weakly formalizable domain. keywords: image retrieval, medical image [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The two {{experiments}} {{presented in}} this article examined the memory representation of <b>pictorial</b> <b>information.</b> The technique used to investigate structure was priming in item recognition. Subjects studied a list of pictures and then were tested for recognition of parts of pictures. In Experiment 1, the time to recognize a target part of a picture was speeded (primed) if the immediately preceding part in the test list was from the same picture. This priming effect was larger if the two parts were interacting with each other in the picture than if they were not interacting. Experiment 2 showed more priming between the interacting, foreground parts of a picture than between one of the interacting parts and a background part. For noninteracting parts, priming between foreground parts was equal to priming between foreground and background parts. It is suggested that priming may prove a useful technique for investigating other aspects of the representation of <b>pictorial</b> <b>information.</b> In recent years, there has been considerable discussion about the representation of pictoria...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{subjecting}} a digital image {{to more than}} one step of the lossy JPEG baseline data compression are studied. The performance in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio as well as the visual artifacts are observed and presented. Two types of visual artifacts have been identified and they are found to correlate closely to the two types of errors introduced when the Discrete Cosine Transform coefficients undergo repeated quantisation as part of the JPEG compression algorithm. A method is proposed to estimate the amount of errors generated in the process, which may be used to determine if any special processing is required to reduce these errors. Several methods to overcome the more severe artifacts in the images are investigated and the experimental results are presented. 1 Introduction and Objective Along with the emergence of multimedia applications, there is a rapid growth in the usage of <b>pictorial</b> <b>information</b> on computers.
