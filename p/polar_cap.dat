40|$|The pbpB {{gene product}} penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP 3) of Escherichia coli {{is one of}} the major targets of {{beta-lactam}} antibiotics. At the permissive temperature, the temperature-sensitive pbpBr 1 mutant, which was obtained after selection for increased resistance to cephalexin, shows a dramatic change in shape which has never been observed before; the <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> are pointed. We show that the substitution of amino acid Asn- 361 by Ser, previously shown to be responsible for increased cephalexin resistance and for temperature sensitivity, causes the pointed <b>polar</b> <b>caps.</b> However, comparison of the morphological and physiological characteristics of the pbpBr 1 mutant with those of other pbpB mutants suggests that the formation of pointed <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> is not correlated with temperature sensitivity or cephalexin resistance. Partial inactivation of PBP 3 by subinhibitory concentrations of cephalexin, furazlocillin, and piperacillin resulted in the formation of slightly pointed <b>polar</b> <b>caps,</b> suggesting that the shape of the <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> is correlated with PBP 3 activity. The large change in the shape of the <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> was accompanied by a small change in the kinetics of peptidoglycan synthesis and in the local rate of surface synthesis activity along the cell envelope...|$|R

5|$|The {{permanent}} {{magnetic moment}} carves {{a part of}} space around Ganymede, creating a tiny magnetosphere embedded inside that of Jupiter; {{it is the only}} moon in the Solar System known to possess the feature. Its diameter is 4–5 RG (RG = 2,631.2km). The Ganymedian magnetosphere has a region of closed field lines located below 30° latitude, where charged particles (electrons and ions) are trapped, creating a kind of radiation belt. The main ion species in the magnetosphere is single ionized oxygen—O+—which fits well with Ganymede's tenuous oxygen atmosphere. In the <b>polar</b> <b>cap</b> regions, at latitudes higher than 30°, magnetic field lines are open, connecting Ganymede with Jupiter's ionosphere. In these areas, the energetic (tens and hundreds of kiloelectronvolt) electrons and ions have been detected, which may cause the auroras observed around the Ganymedian poles. In addition, heavy ions continuously precipitate on Ganymede's polar surface, sputtering and darkening the ice.|$|E

40|$|Since thermal {{migration}} {{is not an}} effective mechanism for water transport in the polar regions at the Galilean satellites, some other process must {{be responsible for the}} formation of Ganymede's <b>polar</b> <b>caps.</b> It is proposed that Ganymede's <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> are the optical manifestation of a process that began with the distribution of an ice sheet over the surface of Ganymede. The combined processes of impact gardening and thermal migration led, in regions at latitudes less than 40 to 45 deg., to the burial of some fraction of this ice, the migration of some to the <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> margins, and a depletion of free ice in the optical surface. At higher latitudes, no process was effective in removing ice from the optical surface, so the remanants of the sheet are visible today...|$|R
25|$|Uranus has a {{relatively}} bland appearance, lacking broad colorful bands and large clouds prevalent on Jupiter and Saturn. No discrete features {{were observed in}} Uranus's atmosphere before 1986. The most conspicuous features on Uranus observed by Voyager 2 were the dark low latitude region between −40° and −20° and bright southern <b>polar</b> <b>cap.</b> The northern boundary of the cap was located at about −45° of latitude. The brightest zonal band was located {{near the edge of}} the cap at −50° to −45° and was then called a polar collar. The southern <b>polar</b> <b>cap,</b> which existed at the time of the solstice in 1986, faded away in 1990s.

25|$|During {{solar proton}} events, {{ionization}} can reach unusually high {{levels in the}} D-region over high and polar latitudes.

40|$|Some {{strains of}} Escherichia coli {{defective}} for dacA, the gene coding for penicillin-binding protein 5, exhibit a strong branching phenotype when cell division is blocked. Since such branch formation implies a differentiation of <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> at ectopic {{locations in the}} cell envelope, we analyzed murein segregation and observed {{a strong correlation between}} areas of inert murein and these morphological anomalies. In particular, the tips of branches exhibited the same properties as those described for <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> of wild-type cells, i. e., the synthesis and turnover of murein were inhibited. Also, the mobility of cell envelope proteins was apparently constrained in areas with morphological defects. Polar regions of branching cells and sacculi had aberrant morphologies with a very high frequency. Of special interest was that areas of inert murein at <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> were often split by areas of active synthesis, a situation unlike that observed in wild-type cells. These observations suggest that in dacA mutants, branches and other morphological anomalies may arise from split <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> or by de novo generation of new poles built around inert peptidoglycan patches in the side walls of the cell...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that gamma-ray pulsar light curves are very {{sensitive}} to the geometry of the pulsar magnetic field. Pulsar magnetic field geometries, such as the retarded vacuum dipole and force-free magneto-spheres have distorted <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> that are offset from the magnetic axis in the direction opposite to rotation. Since this effect is due to the sweepback of field lines near the light cylinder, offset <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> are a generic property of pulsar magnetospheres and their effects should be included in gamma-ray pulsar light curve mod-eling. In slot gap models (having two-pole caustic geometry), the offset <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> cause a strong azimuthal asymmetry of the particle acceleration around the magnetic axis. We have studied the effect of the offset <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> in both retarded vacuum dipole and force-free geometry on the model high-energy pulse profiles. We find that, compared to the profiles derived from symmetric caps, the flux in the pulse peaks, which are caustics formed along the trailing magnetic field lines, increases significantly relative to the off-peak emission, formed along leading field lines. The enhanced contrast produces improved slot gap model fits to Fermi pulsar light curves like Vela, with vacuum dipole fits being more favorable. 1...|$|R

25|$|The real Earth–ionosphere {{waveguide}} is not {{a perfect}} electromagnetic resonant cavity. Losses due to finite ionosphere electrical conductivity lower the propagation speed of electromagnetic signals in the cavity, resulting in a resonance frequency that is lower than would be expected in an ideal case, and the observed peaks are wide. In addition, {{there are a number}} of horizontal asymmetries – day-night difference in the height of the ionosphere, latitudinal changes in the Earth's magnetic field, sudden ionospheric disturbances, <b>polar</b> <b>cap</b> absorption, variation in the Earth radius of ± 11km from equator to geographic poles, etc. that produce other effects in the Schumann resonance power spectra.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the aquifers could be recharged on geological time scales by a sequence of sublimation of the frozen seeps, atmospheric circulation of the vapor to the southern polar ice cap, redeposition of this onto the cap, basal melting under the ice mass, and groundwater circulation on a global scale. This mechanism is appealing as it requires little conjecture about radically different past climate, and fits well with independent theories {{on the origins of}} the martian outflow channels at chaos terrains as major aquifer breaches. However, the hydrostatic head supplied by this mechanism could not feed the numerous channels at elevations greater than the base of the southern <b>polar</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|E
25|$|Colaprete et al. {{conducted}} simulations {{with the}} Mars General Circulation Model which {{show that the}} local climate around the Martian south pole may currently be in an unstable period. The simulated instability {{is rooted in the}} geography of the region, leading the authors to speculate that the sublimation of the polar ice is a local phenomenon rather than a global one. The researchers showed that even with a constant solar luminosity the poles were capable of jumping between states of depositing or losing ice. The trigger for a change of states could be either increased dust loading in the atmosphere or an albedo change due to deposition of water ice on the <b>polar</b> <b>cap.</b> This theory is somewhat problematic {{due to the lack of}} ice depositation after the 2001 global dust storm. Another issue is that the accuracy of the Mars General Circulation Model decreases as the scale of the phenomenon becomes more local.|$|E

40|$|About {{a quarter}} of the Martian {{atmospheric}} mass is exchanged between the atmosphere and the <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> {{in the course of a}} Martian year: CO 2 condenses to form (or add to) the <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> in winter and sublimes into the atmosphere in summer. This paper studies the effect of this CO 2 mass redistribution on Martian rotation and gravitational field. Two mechanisms are examined: (1) the waxing and waning of solid CO 2 in the <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> and (2) the geographical distribution of gaseous CO 2 in the atmosphere. In particular, the net peak-to-peak changes in J 2 and J 3 over a Martian year are both found to be as much as about 6 x 10 to the - 9 th. A simulation suggests that these changes may be detected by the upcoming Mars Observer under favorable but realistic conditions...|$|R
50|$|Both <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> show layered {{features}} {{that result from}} seasonal melting and deposition of ice together with dust from Martian dust storms. These polar layered deposits lie under the permanent <b>polar</b> <b>caps.</b> Information about the past climate of Mars may be eventually revealed in these layers, just as tree ring patterns and ice core data do on Earth. Both <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> also display grooved features, probably caused by wind flow patterns and sun angles, although there are several theories that have been advanced. The grooves are also influenced {{by the amount of}} dust. The more dust, the darker the surface. The darker the surface, the more melting. Dark surfaces absorb more light energy. One large valley, Chasma Boreale runs halfway across the cap. It is about 100 km wide and up to 2 km deep—that's deeper than Earth's Grand Canyon.|$|R
25|$|However, {{there are}} some reasons to believe that {{seasonal}} changes are happening in Uranus. Although Uranus {{is known to have}} a bright south polar region, the north pole is fairly dim, which is incompatible with the model of the seasonal change outlined above. During its previous northern solstice in 1944, Uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness, which suggests that the north pole was not always so dim. This information implies that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens after the equinox. Detailed analysis of the visible and microwave data revealed that the periodical changes of brightness are not completely symmetrical around the solstices, which also indicates a change in the albedo patterns. In addition, the microwave data showed increases in pole–equator contrast after the 1986 solstice. Finally in the 1990s, as Uranus moved away from its solstice, Hubble and ground based telescopes revealed that the south <b>polar</b> <b>cap</b> darkened noticeably (except the southern collar, which remained bright), whereas the northern hemisphere demonstrated increasing activity, such as cloud formations and stronger winds, having bolstered expectations that it would brighten soon. In particular, an analog of the bright polar collar present in its southern hemisphere at −45° was expected to appear in its northern part. This indeed happened in 2007 when Uranus passed an equinox: a faint northern polar collar arose, whereas the southern collar became nearly invisible, although the zonal wind profile remained asymmetric, with northern winds being slightly slower than southern.|$|E
500|$|The caps at both poles consist {{primarily}} (70%) {{of water}} ice. Frozen carbon dioxide accumulates as a comparatively thin layer about one metre thick {{on the north}} cap in the northern winter only, whereas the south cap has a permanent dry ice cover about eight metres thick. This permanent dry ice cover {{at the south pole}} is peppered by flat floored, shallow, roughly circular pits, which repeat imaging shows are expanding by meters per year; this suggests that the permanent CO2 cover over the south pole water ice is degrading over time.

500|$|Triton {{follows a}} {{retrograde}} and quasi-circular orbit, and {{is thought to}} be a gravitationally captured satellite. It was the second moon in the Solar System that was discovered to have a substantial atmosphere, which is primarily nitrogen with small amounts of methane and carbon monoxide. The pressure on Triton's surface is about 14μbar. In 1989 the Voyager 2 spacecraft observed what appeared to be clouds and hazes in this thin atmosphere. Triton is one of the coldest bodies in the Solar System, with a surface temperature of about [...] Its surface is covered by nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide and water ices and has a high geometric albedo of more than 70%. The Bond albedo is even higher, reaching up to 90%. Surface features include the large southern <b>polar</b> <b>cap,</b> older cratered planes cross-cut by graben and scarps, as well as youthful features probably formed by endogenic processes like cryovolcanism. Voyager 2 observations revealed a number of active geysers within the <b>polar</b> <b>cap</b> heated by the Sun, which eject plumes to the height of up to 8km. Triton has a relatively high density of about 2g/cm3 indicating that rocks constitute about two thirds of its mass, and ices (mainly water ice) the remaining one third. There may be a layer of liquid water deep inside Triton, forming a subterranean ocean. Because of its retrograde orbit and relative proximity to Neptune (closer than the Moon is to Earth), tidal deceleration is causing Triton to spiral inward, which will lead to its destruction in about 3.6 billion years.|$|E

500|$|At {{the tower}} a {{temporary}} eyebolt was screwed into the [...] capsule, and a chain hoist {{was used to}} lower the capsule into the gadget. As the capsule entered {{the hole in the}} uranium tamper, it stuck. Robert Bacher realized that the heat from the plutonium core had caused the capsule to expand, while the explosives assembly with the tamper had cooled during the night in the desert. By leaving the capsule in contact with the tamper, the temperatures equalized and in a few minutes the capsule had slipped completely into the tamper. The eyebolt was then removed from the capsule and replaced with a threaded uranium plug, a boron disk was placed on top of the capsule, an aluminum plug was screwed into the hole in the pusher, and the two remaining high explosive lenses were installed.

500|$|All the geysers {{observed}} {{were located}} between 50° and 57°S, {{the part of}} Triton's surface close to the subsolar point. This indicates that solar heating, although very weak at Triton's great distance from the Sun, plays a crucial role. It is thought that the surface of Triton probably consists of a translucent layer of frozen nitrogen overlying a darker substrate, which creates a kind of [...] "solid greenhouse effect". Solar radiation passes through the thin surface ice sheet, slowly heating and vaporizing subsurface nitrogen until enough gas pressure accumulates for it to erupt through the crust. A temperature increase of just 4K above the ambient surface temperature of 37K could drive eruptions to the heights observed. Although commonly termed [...] "cryovolcanic", this nitrogen plume activity is distinct from Triton's larger scale cryovolcanic eruptions, as well as volcanic processes on other worlds, which are powered by the internal heat {{of the body in}} question.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{evidence that}} the Martian climate undergoes quasi-periodic variations, including the polar layered terrain, differences between the residual <b>polar</b> <b>caps,</b> and the current net southward flow of H 2 O.

These 'astronomic variations' control the distribution of the insolation, which in turn influences the partition of volatiles between atmospheric and surface reservoirs. The major effects anticipated at low obliquity are growth of the <b>polar</b> <b>caps,</b> substantial decrease in surface pressure, cessation of duststorms, release of CO 2 from the regolith, and poleward migration of H 2 O ground ice.

40|$|We {{examine the}} tilt of the solar {{magnetic}} dipole away from the rotational axis near the 1996 solar minimum. A persistent tilted dipole may result from an MHD instability acting on the toroidal bands in the solar interior. Nonaxisymmetric eruption of sunspots has been predicted by dynamo theory and observed in sunspot location patterns. The decay of follower spots and the poleward migration of flux could create <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> that are slightly misaligned with the north-south rotational axis. To investigate this, we analyze the coronal streamer geometry observed with LASCO-C 2 {{and the center of}} gravity of the <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> defined by coronal hole boundaries in EIT images and the unipolar magnetic regions in KPVT magnetograms. We model the coronal hole boundaries and neutral line locations by potential field source surface (PFSS) modeling using Kitt Peak magnetograms. Our results are consistent with an observed tilt of 5 - 10 in the heliospheric current sheet at solar minimum and the idea of persistent off-axis magnetic <b>polar</b> <b>caps</b> for CRs 1911 - 1919. The coronal holes show a stable azimuthal angle for CRs 1911 - 1919 with a rotation rate slightly less than the Carrington rate.
