50|$|The term muckraker {{was used}} in the Progressive Era to {{characterize}} reform-minded American journalists who attacked established institutions and leaders as corrupt.

Muckraking magazines—notably McClure's of the <b>publisher</b> <b>S.</b> S. McClure—took on corporate monopolies and political machines while trying to raise public awareness and anger at urban poverty, unsafe working conditions, prostitution, and child labor.|$|R

For the cover art of the April 2003 issue of The Dalit, a journal run by the Dalit Media Network, Chennai, Anand approached the artist Chandru (G. Chandrasekaran) with this story. The logo is a close-up of the artist’s interpretation.|$|R
