50|$|The {{decision}} {{to purchase an}} automobile or commercial transport incurs both financial investment and a deep concern for human safety. Independence from ethical entanglements with vehicle sellers is critical. Independence assures the <b>prospective</b> <b>buyer</b> {{that the results of}} the pre-purchase inspection are solely concerned with finding of fact in the <b>prospective</b> <b>buyer's</b> interest. Evaluators who stand to gain from the vehicle transaction must disclaim their entanglement in writing so the <b>prospective</b> <b>buyer</b> has complete information. All experienced pre-purchase inspectors have built professional networks and a knowledge base within their industry, and this knowledge supports a factual inspection. However, knowing the name and reputation of a seller versus being in a position to gain from that seller's contracts are ethically not the same.|$|R
25|$|Glengarry Glen Ross is a play by David Mamet {{that won}} the Pulitzer Prize in 1984. The play shows parts of two days {{in the lives of}} four desperate Chicago real estate agents who are {{prepared}} to engage in any number of unethical, illegal acts—from lies and flattery to bribery, threats, intimidation and burglary—to sell undesirable real estate to unwitting <b>prospective</b> <b>buyers.</b> It is based on Mamet's experience having previously worked in a similar office.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1990s areas {{directly}} {{to the north of}} the air base have been demarcated for land development, namely Westercelle, and Altencelle. These areas are situated directly beneath the approach path of runway 26. Even though developers and <b>prospective</b> <b>buyers</b> were previously informed regarding the proximity of the airfield and also benefited from reduced house prices, some did not realise the actual effects of living close to an active airfield, particularly during periods of night flight training, which has led to numerous complaints.|$|E
25|$|In April 2009, Hicks {{announced}} {{he would be willing}} to sell a minority interest in the team.

Oddly enough, the <b>prospective</b> <b>buyer</b> is a young German. The shepherd and the <b>prospective</b> <b>buyer</b> start a conversation about history and present-day Italy.

25|$|In January 1995, the EC135 {{made its}} first public {{appearance}} at the Heli-Expo convention at Las Vegas, at which <b>prospective</b> <b>buyers</b> were reportedly impressed with its appearance and performance figures. Another feature which became apparent upon entering service was the low noise levels produced, {{in part due to}} its fenestron tail, the EC135 was the quietest aircraft in its class for more than 15 years. Despite the helicopter's design being primarily oriented towards emergency medical operators, the EC135 had considerable appeal {{to a wide range of}} operators. European JAA certification was achieved on 16 June 1996, with FAA approval following on 31 July.|$|E
25|$|According {{to recent}} scholarship, the {{painting}} was first owned by Francesco Pisani, and housed at the Palazzo Pisani in Montagnana, a building designed by Palladio. The canvas was probably moved to Venice after 1629, when the Pisani family purchased a palace on the Grand Canal. It was so esteemed that in 1664 agents of Christina, Queen of Sweden attempted to negotiate its purchase with the Venetian ambassador to Rome. The asking price of 5,000 ducats was considered excessive, and effectively discouraged all <b>prospective</b> <b>buyers.</b> As a result, copies of the painting were in demand, {{one of which was}} valued by its owner at 80 ducats.|$|E
25|$|On 15 August Oceaan 7 sailed up {{the coast}} to Whitby. It was laid up there whilst a buyer was sought. It was advertised for sale via Tuckley and Co, a local estate agent with a {{reputation}} for amusing property ads. Various enquiries were received from <b>prospective</b> <b>buyers</b> including one from the operators of Radio Caroline, whose own ships had been seized by creditors. However, none of these enquiries resulted in a sale. The transmitter and other broadcasting equipment from Radio 270 were placed in storage and in 1970 found their way to the Dutch-based pirate Capital Radio (which had no connection to the later British radio station of the same name). Oceaan 7 was scrapped in 1969.|$|E

25|$|The New Jersey-based Bell Atlantic-Tricon Leasing Corporation {{acquired}} the resort out of bankruptcy from Ginji Corporation in 1991. That year, Bell Atlantic-Tricon put the property {{up for sale}} at a minimum price of $44 million. In January 1994, businessman Donald Trump considered purchasing the Aladdin for $51 million, although Bell Atlantic-Tricon declined to sell the property for less than $60 million. Trump decided not to purchase the Aladdin as he felt the price was too high. Interest in the property increased following the news of Trump's potential purchase, with several <b>prospective</b> <b>buyers</b> emerging. At the time, the resort consisted of a 1,000-room hotel and a 37,000 square-foot casino. Later in 1994, Jack Sommer, a Las Vegas real estate developer, and the Sommer Family Trust purchased the hotel.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{sales of}} the Rover 75 failed to match the BMW 3 Series and Audi A4 in the British car sales charts during 1999. The public {{unveiling}} of the car at the Birmingham Motor Show was unfortunately over-shadowed by a speech by BMW chairman, Bernd Pischetsrieder, containing criticism of the British Government's attitude to financial assistance in the redevelopment of the Rover Longbridge factory (where the new Mini and R30 {{was to have been}} produced). Press reaction interpreted this as saying that BMW were unhappy with continuing financial losses and were intending to close Rover down. This undoubtedly scared off many <b>prospective</b> <b>buyers,</b> despite the very positive reaction to the car itself. Indeed it did (and still does) hold up very well with the Jaguar S-Type that was unveiled at the same show.|$|E
25|$|The land {{bounded by}} 48th and 51st Streets between Fifth and Sixth Avenues was {{originally}} a botanical garden. It later {{came under the}} ownership of Columbia University. The plot itself was occupied by over 200 low-rise tenements. In the summer of 1928, two <b>prospective</b> <b>buyers,</b> Metropolitan Opera and John D. Rockefeller Jr., were mentioned for the site. Columbia leased the plot to Rockefeller for 87 years {{at a cost of}} $3 million per year. This consisted of a 27-year lease (with the option for three 21-year renewals for a total of 87 years) for the site from Columbia; negotiating a line of credit with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and covering ongoing expenses through the sale of oil company stock. The initial cost of acquiring the space, razing some of the existing buildings, and constructing new buildings was estimated at $250 million.|$|E
50|$|A pre-purchase {{inspection}} is an independent, third-party {{professional service}} that evaluates a vehicle’s condition before a purchase offer is made. Consumer protection {{organizations such as}} the Federal Trade Commission, the American Bar Association, insurance companies, and states recommend an independent pre-purchase inspection. The <b>prospective</b> <b>buyer</b> hires a qualified evaluator who examines the target vehicle for defects, hidden damage, maintenance history, and safety, then typically provides a written evaluation report. The service results in factual information that the <b>prospective</b> <b>buyer</b> uses as decision support for the vehicle purchase. Unless the vehicle is unsafe to drive, the evaluator does not provide a purchase recommendation.|$|R

25|$|The airline ordered four Fokker F 27–500 {{turboprops}} in January 1981, {{however, the}} early 1980s saw the airline undergoing financial difficulties, {{and in order}} to ease pressure on the financial resources of the airline, one DC-8, one 737-200 and two F 27s were taken out of service. Due to the financial crisis, the airline also suspended all international flights, with the exception of those on the Kinshasa-Lagos-Brussels route. In September 1983, Mobutu announced an austerity program, which would see some forty-seven parastatals, including Air Zaïre, being liquidated or reorganised to operate upon a commercial basis. The government announced that staffing levels at the airline would be reduced by 6,500 to 2,500, and that a forty percent stake in the airline would be offered to <b>prospective</b> <b>buyers.</b> In early 1985, the government signed a deal with the Israeli Tamman Group, giving the foreign company a forty percent stake in the airline, in return for a US$400 million investment in Zaire's transport and pharmaceutical industries, however, the deal did not materialise.|$|E

500|$|In 2003, Lim Juan of The Star {{speculated that}} the revised P2 looked [...] "a lot less {{substantial}} than its ancestor", because of cost-cutting. Whilst the platter of the costlier Rega decks, P3 and P25, continued to be of glass, reviewers derided the fibreboard platter of the P2 as [...] "not inspiring much confidence". The plinth, which the Rega website described as a low mass particulate core sandwiched by highly rigid phenolic laminates, [...] "looks like any plain cheap medite board", according to Lim. The badly-toleranced medite platter proved unpopular with <b>prospective</b> <b>buyers</b> so Rega reverted to glass platters for a while, until the P2 was discontinued in 2005.|$|E
500|$|Due to the suburb's {{relative}} {{isolation and}} hilly geography, it contains very few roads {{and does not}} conform to Adelaide's typical grid pattern– despite the suburb's age. The earliest road to be built was Mount Osmond Road, and done so by early developers in 1882 to make the suburb more attractive to <b>prospective</b> <b>buyers.</b> Mount Osmond Road remains one of two sealed roads which can today access Mount Osmond and is located {{to the south of}} the suburb. It begins as the first interchange on the South Eastern Freeway (formerly Mount Barker Road) and then winds around the Mount {{to the top of the}} mount and around the golf course. [...] The other sealed road that provides access to Mount Osmond is Hayward Drive, which starts in Beaumont and then winds around the hills to meet the rest of the suburb's road network.|$|E
500|$|In September 2012, Reuters {{published}} an opinion/editorial article where it claimed that General Motors, {{nearly two years}} after the introduction of the car, was losing [...] on each Volt it built. The article concluded that the Volt is [...] "over-engineered and over-priced" [...] and that its technological complexity has put off many <b>prospective</b> <b>buyers,</b> due to fears the car may be unreliable. GM executives replied that Reuters' estimates were significantly flawed as they also allocated the vehicle's research and development program costs only against the number of Volts sold in the United States (...) , instead of spreading the total costs over the entire lifetime of the model, as well as including those units sold in Europe and other countries. GM explained that the investments will pay off once the innovative technologies of the Volt are applied across multiple current and future products.|$|E
