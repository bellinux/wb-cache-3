50|$|Tetra Pak {{was created}} in 1951 as a {{subsidiary}} to Åkerlund & Rausing, a food carton company established in Malmö in 1929 by Ruben Rausing and Erik Åkerlund, with funding from Mathusan Chandramohan, a rich entrepeneur from Sri Lanka. Rausing, who had studied in New York {{at the beginning of}} the 1920s, had seen self-service grocery stores in the United States, which was unheard of in Europe at the time, and realised that <b>pre-packaging</b> was part of the future in food retailing as a more hygienic and practical way of distributing staple groceries. At the time, these were sold over the counter in cumbersome glass bottles or impractical paper wraps in most European countries. At the end of the 1920s, Rausing bought a run-down packaging factory in Malmö together with the industrialist Erik Åkerlund. Åkerlund & Rausing was the first packaging company in Scandinavia and eventually became a leading manufacturer of dry food cartons. Initially, however, Åkerlund & Rausing had difficulties making profits and in 1933 Åkerlund sold his share to Rausing, who became the sole owner.|$|E

40|$|In {{this time}} of scarce {{resource}}s, coastal resource managers must find ways to prioritize conservation, land use, and restoration efforts. The Habitat Priority Planner (HPP) is a free geospatial tool created by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Coastal Services Center that has received wide praise for its ease of use and broad applicability to conservation strategic planning, restoration, climate change scenarios, and other natural resource management actions. Not a geographic information system (GIS) user? Don’t worry―this tool {{was designed to be}} used in a team setting. One intermediate-level GIS user can push the buttons to show quick results while a roomful of resource managers and stakeholders provide input criteria that determine the results. The Habitat Priority Planner is a toolbar for ESRI’s ArcGIS platform that is composed of three modules: Habitat Classification, Habitat Analysis, and Data Explorer. The tool calculates basic ecological statistics that are used to examine how habitats function within a landscape. The tool <b>pre‐packages</b> several common landscape metrics into a user‐friendly interface for intermediate GIS users. In addition, HPP allows the user to build queries interactively using a graphical interface for demonstrating criteria selections quickly in a visual manner that is useful in stakeholder interactions. Tool advocates and users include land trusts, conservation alliances, nonprofit organizations, and select National Estuarine Research Reserves and refuges of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

40|$|An upper-level {{undergraduate}} course entitled "Radar and Satellite Meteorology" {{has offered}} {{for the past}} five years at the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison. This course has two components, one is the lectures on remote sensing theory, and the other is laboratory exercises that involve the investigation of archived radar and satellite data. One of the most popular laboratory exercises, according to the students' feedback, is the simulated real-time severe weather nowcasting in the computer-equipped classroom. The students are experienced a severe weather outbreak and placed in a real-time operational decision-making environment. Archived Level-II and Level-III Next-generation Radar (NEXRAD) data is viewed with either the freely available Integrated Data Viewer (IDV) or McIDAS software packages. The "bundling" feature of these software packages allows the instructor to <b>pre-package</b> radar data (e. g., reflectivity, storm-relative Doppler velocity) and feed it to the students every four to five minutes, simulating the delay between radar volume scans. Teams of students are required to monitor the evolution of the situation and issue severe weather warnings based on radar analysis skills developed in lecture and previous labs. Documented storm reports are also integrated into the lab to assist — or sometimes detract from — the students' warning decisions, and the classroom clock is even adjusted to correspond with the time of the events. This exercise provides students with a unique operational experience that is often missing from the undergraduate curriculum. Its inherent portability and flexibility allows instructors to adapt it to any historical severe weather event, making it appropriate for courses in mesoscale and synoptic meteorology in addition to remote sensing...|$|R

5000|$|Åkerlund & Rausing {{produced}} {{all sorts}} of paper packaging for dry staple groceries, but Rausing was determined {{to find a way}} to <b>pre-package</b> liquids like milk and cream, and spent large sums on developing a viable package. The goal was to provide optimal food safety, hygiene and distribution efficiency using a minimum amount of material, according to the subsequently famous credo that a package should [...] "save more than it costs". The new package had to be sufficiently cheap to be able to compete with loose milk, meaning that a minimum of material waste and a maximum of production efficiency needed to be obtained.In 1943, the Åkerlund & Rausing lab started to work on developing the milk carton, and, in 1944, came up with the idea of constructing a tetrahedron-shaped package out of a tube of paper. The idea was simple but efficient, making optimal use of the material involved. After some initial hesitation, Rausing understood the potential of the package and filed for a patent on 27 March 1944. The rest of the 1940s were spent developing viable packaging materials and solving the technical problems of filling, sealing, and distribution. It was reportedly Rausing’s wife Elisabeth who came up with the idea of continuously sealing the packages through the milk while filling the tube in the manner of stuffing sausages, to prevent oxygen from entering the package. In 1946, a model for a packaging machine was presented by engineer Harry Järund, and in collaboration with Swedish paper mills and foreign chemical companies a viable paper for packaging was finally produced when coating carton paper with polyethylene, which made the paper waterproof and allowing for heat-sealing during filling.|$|R

40|$|Discrete {{waves in}} the voltage-clamped {{photoreceptor}} of Limulus are remarkably similar in all essential properties {{to those found in}} an unclamped cell. The latency distribution of discrete waves is not affected by considerable changes in the holding potential in a voltage-clamped cell. Both large and small waves occur in voltage-clamped and unclamped cells and in approximately the same proportion. Large and small waves also share the same latency distributions and spectral sensitivity. We suggest that small waves may result from the activation of damaged membrane areas. Large waves have an average amplitude of approximately 5 nA in voltage-clamped photoreceptors. It probably requires several square microns of cell membrane to support this much photo-current. Thus the amplification inherent in the discrete wave process may involve spatial spread of activation from unimolecular dimensions to several square microns of cell membrane surface.

40|$|Combinatorial auctions {{have been}} studied {{analytically}} for several years, but only limited experimental results are available, in particular for auctions with more than 10 items. We investigate the Hierarchical Package Bidding auction (HPB), the Combinatorial Clock auction (CC), and one pseudo-dual price auction (PDP) experimentally, as all these formats were used or suggested for high-stakes spectrum auctions. We want to understand the impact that different auction formats have on bidder behavior and allocative efficiency. Interestingly, {{we find that the}} main source of inefficiency in all formats is the bidders ’ preselection of packages, rather than their strategies or auction rules; bidders mostly preselect a small number of packages of interest early in the auction. CC achieves high efficiency and revenue in all experiments, but HPB yields similar results even in value models, where hierarchical <b>pre-packaging</b> is difficult.

40|$|The European Commission {{introduced}} {{impact assessment}} (IA) in 2002 following recommendations from the Mandelkern group on Better Regulation. The basic rationale of IA is that proposals {{must be prepared}} {{on the basis of}} an analysis of whether regulatory intervention is needed and whether it is appropriate to intervene at the EU level. An IA report, published together with the proposal, summarises the results and highlights the trade-offs between the potential economic, social and environmental impacts associated with various policy options. Nowadays, IA is required for all major proposals. It is also increasingly being used throughout the whole legislative process as the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers are implementing their respective commitments to IA. The thesis starts out by developing a typology of possible uses of impact assessment in EU lawmaking, which serves as a framework of reference for the subsequent analysis of the development of EU IA. The idea is explored that the three âco-legislatorsâ are not the only relevant actors in IA processes; national institutions, advisory bodies, review institutions, regulatory bodies, private co-actors and third-country actors all play their part. Case-studies on the new chemicals regulation (REACH), the thematic strategy on air quality (CAFE), the <b>pre-packaging</b> directive and the data retention directive lend empirical backing to the theoretical claims.

40|$|A study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} {{the potential benefits}} of <b>pre-packaging</b> and storage temperature in extending the shelf life of okra was conducted at Egerton University Horticulture Field and Biotechnology Laboratory. Okra pods were subjected to different combination of packaging and storage temperature. Three levels of packaging were used consisting of perforated (punched) polyfilm bags, non-perforated polyfilm bags (0. 03 mm thickness) and unpackaged to modifying the storage atmosphere. Pods weighing 100 g were put in the various packages and the unpackaged pods were placed on flat cartons. Four levels of storage temperature, 4 oC, 8. 5 oC, 13 oC and room temperature storage were used for storing okra pods. The temperatures of 4 oC, 8. 5 oC and 13 oC were attained in refrigerators while room temperature was obtained by placing the pods on tables in the open. Pods stored at 4 oC were unmarketable 21 days after storage as they were frozen and had the highest electrolyte leakage due to high chilling injury. All unpackaged okra pods stored at all temperatures were also not marketable by day 21 of storage as they were dry and shriveled. These pods had the greatest weight loss (79 %) at 13 oC compared to weight loss of less than 30 % observed in the pods stored at the same temperature (13 oC) but kept in perforated packages. The best marketable pods that were not frozen and had the least off odour were those kept at 13 oC storage temperature treatment in non perforated and perforated packaging.

40|$|Abstract Background There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} {{in the role of}} the private for-profit sector in health service provision in low- and middle-income countries. The private sector represents an important source of care for all socioeconomic groups, including the poorest and substantial concerns have been raised about the quality of care it provides. Interventions have been developed to address these technical failures and simultaneously take advantage of the potential for involving private providers to achieve public health goals. Limited information is available on the extent to which these interventions have successfully expanded access to quality health services for poor and disadvantaged populations. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by presenting the results of a systematic literature review on the effectiveness of working with private for-profit providers to reach the poor. Methods The search topic of the systematic literature review was the effectiveness of interventions working with the private for-profit sector to improve utilization of quality health services by the poor. Interventions included social marketing, use of vouchers, <b>pre-packaging</b> of drugs, franchising, training, regulation, accreditation and contracting-out. The search for published literature used a series of electronic databases including PubMed, Popline, HMIC and CabHealth Global Health. The search for grey and unpublished literature used documents available on the World Wide Web. We focused on studies which evaluated the impact of interventions on utilization and/or quality of services and which provided information on the socioeconomic status of the beneficiary populations. Results A total of 2483 references were retrieved, of which 52 qualified as impact evaluations. Data were available on the average socioeconomic status of recipient communities for 5 interventions, and on the distribution of benefits across socioeconomic groups for 5 interventions. Conclusion Few studies provided evidence on the impact of private sector interventions on quality and/or utilization of care by the poor. It was, however, evident that many interventions have worked successfully in poor communities and positive equity impacts can be inferred from interventions that work with types of providers predominantly used by poor people. Better evidence of the equity impact of interventions working with the private sector is needed for more robust conclusions to be drawn. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} a result of the final project of the authors’ Master of Science degree that was {{conducted}} at General Electric Healthcare’s Umeå Plant. The project was initiated to contribute to the efforts already taking place in order to improve the plant’s delivery reliability. Though there were many factors involved, some of the problems were found to be associated with the internal material receiving process. The focus of this report is therefore on mapping and developing this process with respect to lead time and variability in lead time. To suit this specific task, the three improvement philosophies of Six Sigma, Lean and Theory of Constraints were combined to make up the working model of the project. Six Sigma was used to attack the process variation and Lean to minimise waiting time and increase the value to the customer. Theory of Constraints was used to maximise throughput by identifying and strengthening the weakest link. To tie the three philosophies together the Plan Do Check Act-cycle was used, intended to encourage systematic improvements of the process. By mapping and evaluating the current state of the goods receiving process, five improvement areas were revealed, namely: lack of process follow up, quality inspection as a process constraint, lack of first in first out-flow and ineffective space utilisation, insufficient process deviation management and disturbances in the material flow caused by material shortages. Suggestions to solving the discovered problems have been developed in cooperation with the process operators and summarised in an action plan. One of the suggested changes is to calculate the costs associated with handling and inspection of deliveries and then incorporate this cost in the selection and evaluation of suppliers. Another part of the action plan is to evaluate the process capability of the suppliers to determine the need for quality inspection at arrival. Regarding the process operations, automatic registration, simplified handling through <b>pre-packaging</b> and first in first out handling routines are suggested to speed up the flow. A system for regular process follow-up and deviations management is also proposed. A secondary purpose of the project has been to contribute to the knowledge of student led improvement work by reflecting on experiences from performing research related to the primary purpose. Besides the support that the project working model is contributing with, the most important success factors were found to be a common understanding and agreement of the purpose of the project, active involvement and participation by operators and management and regular project follow-up together with key persons.

40|$|This {{research}} thesis set out {{to better}} understand the professional knowledge bases of Western teachers working in offshore education in Indonesia. This research explored what two groups of Western teachers said about the students they taught, their own role, professional and social identity, the knowledge transmitted, and their pedagogical strategies whilst teaching offshore. Such an investigation is significant on a number of levels. Firstly, these teachers were working within a period of rapid economic, political, cultural and educational change described as ‘New Times’ (Hall, 1996 a). Secondly, the experiences of teachers working in offshore education have rarely been reported in the literature (see Johnston, 1999). A review of the literature on teachers’ professional knowledge bases (Shulman, 1986 a, 1986 b, 1987; Turner-Bisset, 1997, 1999) concluded that, in general terms, teachers draw on three main interrelated and changing knowledge bases: knowledge of content, knowledge of teaching processes and knowledge of their students. This review also explored the notion that teachers had an additional knowledge base that was in a continual state of negotiation and closely related to the aforementioned knowledge bases: teachers’ knowledge of their own and students’ pedagogic identities (Bernstein, 2000). A theoretical framework appropriate to exploring the overarching research problem was developed. This framework drew on models of teachers’ knowledge bases (Elbaz, 1983; Shulman, 1986 a, 1986 b, 1987; Nias, 1989; Turner-Bisset, 1997, 1999), the sociology of knowledge (Bernstein, 1975, 1990, 1996, 1999, 2000), and notions of pedagogic identity (Bernstein, 2000). This framework theorised the types of knowledges taught, categories of teaching process knowledge, and the range of pedagogic identities made available to teachers and students in new times. More specifically, this research examined two case studies (see Stake, 1988, 2000; Yin, 1994) of Western teachers employed by Australian educational institutions who worked in Central Java, Indonesia, in the mid-to-late 1990 s. The teacher participants from both case studies taught a range of subjects and used English as the medium of instruction. Data for both case studies were generated via semi-structured interviews (see Kvale, 1996; Silverman, 1985, 1997). The interviews focused on the teachers’ descriptions of the learner characteristics of Indonesian students, their professional roles whilst teaching offshore, and curriculum and pedagogic design. The analyses produced four major findings. The first major finding of the analyses confirmed that the teacher participants in this study drew on all proposed professional knowledge bases and that these knowledge bases were interrelated. This suggests that teachers must have all knowledge bases present for them to do their work successfully. The second major finding was that teachers’ professional knowledge bases were constantly being negotiated in response to their beliefs about their work and the past, present and future demands of the local context. For example, the content and teaching processes of English lessons may have varied as their own and their students’ pedagogic identities were re-negotiated in different contexts of teaching and learning. Another major finding was that it was only when the teachers entered into dialogue with the Indonesian students and community members and/or reflective dialogue amongst themselves, that they started to question the stereotypical views of Indonesian learners as passive, shy and quiet. The final major finding was that the teachers were positioned in multiple ways by contradictory and conflicting discourses. The analyses suggested that teachers’ pedagogic identities were a site of struggle between dominant market orientations and the criteria that the teachers thought should determine who was a legitimate teacher of offshore Indonesian students. The accounts from one of the case studies suggested that dominant market orientations centred on experience and qualifications in unison with prescribed and proscribed cultural, gender and age relations. Competent teachers who were perceived to be white, Western, male and senior in terms of age relations seemed to be the most easily accepted as offshore teachers of foundation programs for Indonesian students. The analyses suggested that the teachers thought that their legitimacy to be an offshore teacher of Indonesian students should be based on their teaching expertise alone. However, managers of Australian offshore educational institutions conceded that {{it was very difficult to}} bring about change in terms of teacher legitimisation. These findings have three implications for the work of offshore teachers and program administrators. Firstly, offshore programs that favour the <b>pre-packaging</b> of curricula content with little emphasis on the professional development and support needs of teachers do not foster work conditions which encourage teachers to re-design or modify curricula in response to the specific needs of learners. Secondly, pre-packaged programs do not support teachers to enter into negotiations concerning students’ or their own pedagogic identities or the past, present and future demands of local contexts. These are important implications because they affect the way that teachers work, and hence how responsive teachers can be to learners’ needs and how active they can be in the negotiation process as it relates to pedagogic identities. Finally, the findings point to the importance of establishing a learning community or learning network to assist Western teachers engaged in offshore educational work in Asian countries such as Indonesia. Such a community or network would enable teachers to engage and modify the complexity of knowledge bases required for effective localised offshore teaching. Given the burgeoning increase in the availability and use of electronic technology in new times, such as internet, emails and web cameras, these learning networks could be set up to have maximum benefit with minimal on-going costs...|$|E
