A pressure time series measured {{in a bubble}} column consists of local <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuations</b> and global <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> The local <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuations</b> arise from the liquid velocity fluctuations induced by the large gas bubbles and by the changes in gas holdup.

40|$|Abstract—Saturated {{two-phase}} fluid flows are often subject to pressure induced oscillations. Due to compressibility the vapor bubbles {{act as a}} spring with an asymmetric non-linear characteristic. The volume of the vapor bubbles increases or decreases differently if the <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuations</b> are compressing or expanding; consequently, compressing <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in a two-phase pipe flow cause less displacement {{in the direction of}} the pipe flow than expanding <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> The displacement depends on the ratio of liquid to vapor, the ratio of <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuations</b> over average <b>pressure</b> and on the exciting frequency of the <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> In addition, <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in saturated vapor bubbles cause condensation and evaporation within the bubbles and change periodically the ratio between liquid to vapor, and influence the dynamical parameters for the oscillation.

In this paper, <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuation</b> experiments are carried out for five impeller configurations with different stagger angles by using the same test rig system.

The distributions of pressure fluctuations are relatively uniform along the suction chamber wall, and the maximum <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuation</b> amplitude is reached near the suction inlet tongue region.

40|$|Though many {{consider}} {{the magnitude of}} respiratory sinus arrhythmia as an index of cardiac vagal control, its physiological origins remain unclear. One influential model postulates that the systolic pressure rise within a given beat stimulates the baroreflex arc to adjust the following heart period such that diastolic pressure is “stabilized” and hence displays lesser fluctuation. Accordingly, the magnitude of diastolic <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuations</b> with respiration should change reciprocally after augmentation or inhibition of respiratory sinus arrhythmia. To test this, we augmented and subsequently inhibited respiratory sinus arrhythmia with vagotonic and vagolytic atropine administration in 19 healthy young volunteers to assess the relation between respiratory R-R interval and diastolic <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> Respiratory diastolic <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuations</b> showed parallel rather than inverse changes in relation to those in respiratory sinus arrhythmia: they increased with augmented respiratory sinus arrhythmia (138 and 190 % of baseline in the frequency and time domains, both P 60 % {{of the change in}} diastolic <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuations</b> was explained by the change in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (R 2 = 0. 62; P < 0. 001), that is, an ∼ 50 -ms increase or decrease in respiratory sinus arrhythmia resulted in a parallel ∼ 1 -mmHg change in diastolic <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> Thus, in young healthy individuals during supine rest, respiratory fluctuations in R-R interval do not buffer against diastolic <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuations</b> but actually cause diastolic <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuations.</b> Therefore, our data provide little evidence for a predominant role of a baroreflex feedback mechanism underlying respiratory sinus arrhythmia during supine rest...|$|R

The experiment was carried out under steady flow conditions and <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuations</b> at various positions along the wall of the ICA model were measured with a calibrated condenser microphone and a digital voltmeter. Dynamic similarity between air flow in the model and blood flow in the artery was scaled by the Reynolds number and characteristic frequencies of the <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuations</b> scaled by the Strouhal number. A Fast Fourier Transform of the measured <b>pressure</b> <b>fluctuations</b> was performed {{with the aid of a}} Strobe Aquisition Unit and the resultant frequency spectra analysed.

A dominant characteristic frequency of 34 Hz, as well as periodic doubling and band-broadening were observed. The dominant characteristic frequency was found to increase with flowrate.
