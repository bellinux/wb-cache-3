5|$|Breeding {{in order}} to correct <b>pigmentation</b> often lacks dependability. Because colour is {{determined}} by many genes, {{some of which are}} recessive, crossbreeding a <b>pigmentation</b> non-standard yellow Labrador to a black Labrador may not correct the matter or prevent future generations carrying the same recessive genes. For similar reasons, crossbreeding chocolate to yellow Labradors is also often avoided.|$|E
5|$|Labrador {{colouration}} {{is controlled}} by multiple genes. It is possible for recessive genes to re-emerge in later generations. Also, there can sometimes be unexpected <b>pigmentation</b> effects to {{different parts of the}} body. <b>Pigmentation</b> effects appear in regard to yellow Labradors, and sometimes chocolate, and hence the majority of this section covers <b>pigmentation</b> within the yellow Labrador. The most common places where <b>pigmentation</b> is visible are the nose, lips, gums, feet, tail, and the rims of the eyes, which may be black, brown, light yellow-brown ("liver", caused by having two genes for chocolate), or several other colours. A Labrador can carry genes for a different colour, for example a black Labrador can carry recessive chocolate and yellow genes, and a yellow Labrador can carry recessive genes for the other two colours. DNA testing can reveal some aspects of these. Less common pigmentations (other than pink) are a fault, not a disqualification, and hence such dogs are still permitted to be shown.|$|E

40|$|The term "pigmentation of {{the oral}} mucosa" is applied {{to a wide range}} of lesions or {{conditions}} featuring a change of color of oral tissues. Lesions not associated with an accumulation of pigment (e. g., Fordyce spots) are usually not classified as pigmented lesions. Two groups of pigmented lesions {{of the oral}} mucosa are recognized: 1) melanin-associated lesions, including racial <b>pigmentations,</b> melanotic macules, melanocytic nevi, and malignant melanoma; and 2) nonmelanin-associated lesions (e. g., blood-related <b>pigmentations,</b> metallic <b>pigmentations).</b> This paper presents a clinicopathologic review of the recent literature with emphasis on the main diagnostic features, including the use of immunohistochemical markers. A flow-chart is added that may help the clinician in the diagnosis and management of these lesions...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the diagnostic value of diascopy and other non-invasive clinical aids on recent differential diagnosis algorithms of oral mucosal <b>pigmentations</b> affecting subjects of any age. Material and Methods: Data Sources: this systematic review {{was conducted by}} searching PubMed, Scopus, Dentistry & Oral Sciences Source and the Cochrane Library (2000 - 2015); Study Selection: two reviewers independently selected all types of English articles describing differential diagnosis algorithms of oral <b>pigmentations</b> and checked the references of finally included papers; Data Extraction: one reviewer performed the data extraction and quality assessment based on previously defined fields while the other reviewer checked their validity. Results: Data Synthesis: eight narrative reviews and one single case report met the inclusion criteria. Diascopy was used on six algorithms (66. 67 %) and X-ray was included once (11. 11 %; 44. 44 % with text mentions); these were considered helpful tools in the diagnosis of intravascular and exogenous <b>pigmentations,</b> respectively. Surface rubbing was described once in the text (11. 11 %). Conclusions: Diascopy was the most applied method followed by X-ray and surface rubbing. The limited scope of these procedures only makes them useful when a positive result is obtained, turning biopsy into the most recommended technique when diagnosis cannot be established on clinical grounds alon...|$|R

40|$|Imatinib mesylate is a {{tyrosine}} kinase inhibitor which targets Bcr-Abl-protein, c-Kit, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. The drug was originally developed {{for treatment of}} chronic myeloid leukemia but is also regarded as first-line treatment of patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). Dermatologic side effects are common, with superficial edema and rash as the most frequent. In addition, imatinib mesylate treatment {{is often associated with}} hypopigmentation. Intraoral side effects are very rare. The present paper demonstrates 1 patient with GIST and 2 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia treated with imatinib mesylate for 5 - 6 years. All 3 patients presented with diffuse solitary bluish-brown <b>pigmentations</b> in the hard palate. The lesions persisted at follow-ups. There were no other <b>pigmentations</b> in the oral mucosa. The histopathologic examination showed depositions of melanin pigment in the lamina propria.

5|$|Chemical peels {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the {{appearance}} of acne scars. Mild peels include those using glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, Jessner's solution, or a lower concentrations (20%) of trichloroacetic acid. These peels only affect the epidermal layer of the skin and can be useful in the treatment of superficial acne scars as well as skin <b>pigmentation</b> changes from inflammatory acne. Higher concentrations of trichloroacetic acid (30â€“40%) are considered to be medium-strength peels and affect skin as deep as the papillary dermis. Formulations of trichloroacetic acid concentrated to 50% or more are considered to be deep chemical peels. Medium-strength and deep-strength chemical peels are more effective for deeper atrophic scars, but are more likely to cause side effects such as skin <b>pigmentation</b> changes, infection, and small white superficial cysts known as milia.|$|E
5|$|Melanism is {{the direct}} {{opposite}} of albinism. An unusually {{high level of}} melanin <b>pigmentation</b> (and sometimes absence {{of other types of}} pigment in species that have more than one) results in an appearance darker than non-melanistic specimens from the same genepool.|$|E

40|$|Preliminary {{results of}} the {{characterization}} of red <b>pigmentations</b> on paleolithic artefacts from the southern area of Montes Albanos (Rome, Italy) are presented. The set of materials consists of three decorated rounded pebblestones and a cortical flint blade typologically attributable to the Upper Paleolithic (Final Epigravetense, 14, 000 - 12, 000 cal BP). The findings were observed with optical microscope Nikon SMZ 1000 / 800 with magnifications of 1 x to 6. 3 x. In two pebblestones, one decorated with parallel engravings, residues of ocher were detected in association with traces of use. In the third one, stained red dye was observed to form geometric patterns. Finally, reddish <b>pigmentations</b> were located on the cortical dorsal surface of a flint blade. To characterize chemically the coloring agent detected, macro-microscopically, Raman spectroscopy was used, a technique that allowed {{the study of the}} nature of the residues and the detection of additional organic materials whose presence must be related to post-depositional contaminations produced by the manipulation or/and surface exposure of artifacts...|$|R

5|$|A {{study of}} {{seedlings}} grown from seed collected in 28 areas showed a north-south change in leaf shape and dimensions. Seedling leaves get longer and narrower southwards. Seedlings often have leaves with red-brown <b>pigmentation</b> which disappears in older plants, and this coloration becomes increasingly common towards the south. The changes in shapeâ€”leaves getting narrower and more robust {{from north to}} south and from lowland to montaneâ€”suggest adaptations to colder weather.|$|E
5|$|Commelina communis is {{also used}} as a model {{organism}} in plant physiology and plant development to a limited extent, especially in relation to stomatal physiology and the biology of <b>pigmentation</b> development. For example, the blue <b>pigmentation</b> of Asiatic dayflower petals was shown to consist of a large complex of six anthocyanins, six flavones, and two associated magenesium ions, demonstrating that supramolecular complexes of several copigments and chelated metals often determine colour. Other research on the plant has helped to explain photoreceptor systems in plants such as their stomatal responses to blue light versus red light spectrums, abscisic acid perception {{and its role in}} cell signaling, particularly concerning the chemical's role in stomatal function, the role of vanadates in inhibiting stomatal opening, and the necessity of calcium in stomatal closure, among other topics. Its widespread use in stomatal studies {{is due to the fact}} that the leaves produce exceptional epidermal peels that are consistently one cell layer thick. This same quality makes the plant popular for use in laboratory exercises in higher education for demonstrating stomatal function and morphology. Guard cell turgor pressure and its regulation in the opening and closing of stomata is particularly easy to demonstrate with the Asiatic dayflower.|$|E
5|$|Dermabrasion is an {{effective}} therapeutic procedure for reducing the appearance of superficial atrophic scars of the boxcar and rolling varieties. Ice-pick scars do not respond well to treatment with dermabrasion due to their depth.

40|$|AbstractHerein {{we report}} a rare case of {{classical}} Dowling-Degos disease (DDD) in a Taiwanese woman. A 23 -year-old Taiwanese woman presented with generalized hyperpigmentation in irregular and reticulated shapes {{that she had}} had since junior high school. Her mother and two sisters had also developed similar <b>pigmentations,</b> starting during their teenage years. The patient did not have previous skin lesions or a history of trauma. She did not have any nail or hair abnormalities. Viewed through a microscope, the hyperpigmented area was found to have elongated rete ridges, the tips of which were found to have a concentration of melanin. Based on the disease onset, family history, clinical and histopathological manifestations, the patient was diagnosed as having DDD. We performed an electron microscopic study revealing a greater number of mature melanosomes in the keratinocytes in the pigmented skin than in those in the nonpigmented skin. The numbers of melanosomes in the melanocytes were similar in both types of skin. This is the first direct comparison of ultrastructural features in pigmented and uninvolved skin in Taiwanese with DDD.
