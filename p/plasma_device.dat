40|$|The EXB {{configuration}} of various low temperature <b>plasma</b> <b>devices</b> is often {{responsible for the}} formation of rotating structures and instabilities leading to anomalous electron transport across the magnetic field. In these devices, electrons are strongly magnetized while ions are weakly or not magnetized and this leads to specific physical phenomena that are not present in fusion plasmas where both electrons and ions are strongly magnetized. In this paper we describe basic phenomena involving rotating plasma structures in simple configurations of low temperature EXB <b>plasma</b> <b>devices</b> on the basis of PIC-MCC (Particle-In-Cell Monte Carlo Collisions) simulations. We focus on three examples: rotating electron vortices and rotating spokes in cylindrical magnetrons, and azimuthal electron-cyclotron drift instability in Hall thrusters.

5000|$|On {{the eve of}} Thanksgiving, House and {{the team}} take {{on the case of}} James Sidas (Esteban Powell), an {{exceptionally}} brilliant physicist (IQ 178), in fact the youngest person to ever graduate MIT, who traded his successful career for a job as a courier to be with his intellectually inferior wife (IQ 87). For the ailing patient, intelligence is a miserable burden that alienates him from others. The team eventually suspects he suffers from TTP, but the splenectomy they perform does not improve his situation, ruling that condition out. However, it is later revealed that a depression as a teenager due to his loneliness as a child prodigy led him to attempt suicide, and House realizes that the ribs he broke back then made his spleen split into several parts, which is why the procedure had no effect - it was TTP all along. The remaining symptoms are explained after the discovery of his addiction to DXM (mixed with alcohol to prevent brain damage), which he used to reduce his intellect. As Sidas regains his status of intellectual genius by not abusing the addictive medicine, he begins work in applied physics, drawing a schematic for a toroidal helicon <b>plasma</b> <b>device,</b> and is reassured that he cannot relate to his wife with his original intellect. House, relating to his situation, essentially helps [...] "lobotomize Einstein" [...] by giving him back his meds, as the patient wishes to be dumb and happy rather than smart and miserable.|$|E
5000|$|Let’s first {{consider}} the simple {{model of a}} plasma supported by a magnetic field B in a uniform gravitational field g. To simplify matters, assume that the internal energy {{of the system is}} zero such that static equilibrium may be obtained from the balance of the gravitational force and the magnetic field pressure on the boundary of the plasma. The change in the potential is then given by the equation:.If two adjacent flux tubes lying opposite along the boundary (one fluid tube and one magnetic flux tube) are interchanged the volume element doesn’t change and the field lines are straight. Therefore, the magnetic potential doesn’t change, but the gravitational potential changes since it was moved along the z axis. Since the change in is negative the potential is decreasing. A decreasing potential indicates a more energetically favorable system and consequently an instability. The origin of this instability is in the J × B forces that occur at the boundary between the plasma and magnetic field. At this boundary there are slight ripple-like perturbations in which the low points must have a larger current than the high points since at the low point more gravity is being supported against the gravity. The difference in current allows negative and positive charge to build up along the opposite sides of the valley. The charge build-up produces an E field between the hill and the valley. The accompanying E × B drifts are {{in the same direction as}} the ripple, amplifying the effect. This is what is physically meant by the “interchange” motion.These interchange motions also occur in plasmas that are in a system with a large centrifugal force. In a cylindrically symmetric <b>plasma</b> <b>device,</b> radial electric fields cause the plasma to rotate rapidly in a column around the axis. Acting opposite to the gravity in the simple model, the centrifugal force moves the plasma outward where the ripple-like perturbations (sometimes called “flute” instabilities) occur on the boundary. This is important for the study of the magnetosphere in which the co-rotational forces are stronger than the opposing gravity of the planet. Effectively, the less dense “bubbles” inject radially inward in this configuration. Without gravity or an inertial force, interchange instabilities can still occur if the plasma is in a curved magnetic field. If we assume the potential energy to be purely magnetic then the change in potential energy is:. If the fluid is incompressible then the equation can be simplified into [...] Since (to maintain pressure balance), the above equation shows that if the system is unstable. Physically, this means that if the field lines are toward the region of higher plasma density then the system is susceptible to interchange motions. To derive a more rigorous stability condition, the perturbations that cause an instability must be generalized. The momentum equation for a resistive MHD is linearized and then manipulated into a linear force operator. Due to purely mathematical reasons, it is then possible to split the analysis into two approaches: the normal mode method and the energy method. The normal mode method essentially looks for the eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies and summing the solutions to form the general solution. The energy method is similar to the simpler approach outlined above where is found for any arbitrary perturbation in order to maintain the condition [...] These two methods are not exclusive and can be used together to establish a reliable diagnosis of the stability.|$|E

40|$|Arrays of {{microcavity}} and microchannel plasmas {{with characteristic}} dimensions of 25 - 800 micrometer have been generated in glass substrates. To reproducibly fabricate the arrays, glass micromaching using replica molding and micropowder blasting was proposed and demonstrated. The microplasmas were optically and electrically probed in this work. The investigation showed that each plasma is physically separated and yet, under the proper conditions, is optically and/or electrically coupled to its neighbors. In arrays {{as large as}} 10 parallel microchannel plasmas, evidence of optical coupling among the channels is observed {{in the form of}} strongly enhanced atomic emission which is attributed to electron heating driven by the resonant absorption of scattered radiation. The transition from Townsend-like discharges to abnormal glow-like discharges was observed in arrays of microcavity <b>plasma</b> <b>devices.</b> During the transition, bistable oscillations of visible emission were observed in microcavity <b>plasma</b> <b>devices</b> operating in Ne at pressures of 200 - 700 Torr.

40|$|Background/purpose: Atmospheric-pressure plasma {{is a new}} {{technology}} for biomedical applications. Utilization of an ionized gas (plasma) to achieve disinfection is an alternative sterilization technique that has become popular recently due to its safety, cost effectiveness, and superior performance to traditional methods. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the germicidal effectiveness of a low-temperature atmospheric-pressure <b>plasma</b> <b>device</b> by treating Enterococcus faecalis for different durations. Materials and methods: A novel low-temperature atmospheric-pressure <b>plasma</b> <b>device</b> was developed for this study. A suspension of E. faecalis (BCRC 10789) was standardized to 107  colony-forming units (CFUs) /mL, as confirmed by an optical spectrophotometer. E. faecalis was first transferred and spread on 70 sterile cover glasses measuring 18  mm 2. Each batch of 10 specimens was exposed to the low-temperature <b>plasma</b> <b>device</b> and treated for 1  minute, 2  minutes, 3  minutes, 5  minutes, 10  minutes, and 15  minutes; the specimen treated for 0  minute served as the control. The cover glasses containing plasma-treated bacteria were then immersed into 10  mL deionized distilled water and vibrated with an ultrasonic device to detach the residual fluid. Bacterial colonies were finally inoculated into Luria–Bertani agar plates and cultured at 37 °C for 24  hours. The numbers of bacterial colonies were counted to evaluate the germicidal efficacy of the <b>plasma</b> <b>device,</b> and the results were expressed as CFUs. Meanwhile, field emission scanning electron microscopy was performed to observe the cell morphology of E. faecalis prior to and after plasma treatment. Results: Quantitative analysis of sterilization revealed a reduction in the number of bacterial colonies with time duration. When specimens were treated for 10  minutes, colonies of E. faecalis decreased from 105  CFUs to 102  CFUs. The sterilization D-value (90 % cell reduction) of experiments was 2  minutes. Conclusion: The novel low-temperature atmospheric-pressure device was capable of achieving effective sterilization of E. faecalis within a 2 -minute interval.
