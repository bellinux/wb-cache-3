25|$|Up to 2,000 protesters {{gathered}} at Belfast City Hall on 8 December. The crowd was addressed by former British National Party (BNP) fundraiser Jim Dowson. Also present were <b>Progressive</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> (PUP) leader Billy Hutchinson and Ulster Defence Association (UDA) commander Jackie McDonald. Some {{of the protesters}} burnt an Irish tricolour. There were minor clashes with police after the rally.|$|E
25|$|The {{seat was}} {{consistently}} {{held by the}} Ulster Unionist Party until the 1974 general election when the sitting MP, Stanley McMaster, defended it as a Pro-Assembly Unionist against a united anti-Sunningdale Agreement coalition which nominated William Craig of the Vanguard <b>Progressive</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party.</b> Craig won the seat and held it for five years, moving to the UUP in February 1978.|$|E
25|$|Ervine was {{released}} from prison in 1980. He owned a newsagents' in Belfast for several years before taking up full-time politics. He stood in local council elections as a <b>Progressive</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> (PUP) candidate in 1985. In 1998, {{he was elected to the}} Northern Ireland Assembly to represent Belfast East and was re-elected in 2003. He was also a member of Belfast City Council from 1997.|$|E
50|$|The {{strategy}} {{has also been}} attributed as having inspired members of the Loyalist Ulster Defence Association such as John McMichael to seek a similar route into electoral politics through vehicles such as the Ulster Loyalist Democratic Party (later Ulster Democratic Party (UDP)). However, parties directly linked to Loyalist paramilitaries had minimal success in elections in Northern Ireland, with the UDP's and <b>Progressive</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party's</b> (PUP) combined electoral share failing to exceed 1% before the May 1996 elections for the Northern Ireland Forum.|$|R
5000|$|As well as {{his role}} with the Inner Council, Smallwoods was also made the public {{spokesman}} for the Ulster Democratic Party (UDP) following his release from prison. He became party chairman in the early 1990s and around this time also became liaison officer for the UDA to the Combined Loyalist Military Command. During the early 1990s, Smallwoods was in regular contact with the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party's</b> Gusty Spence and {{took part in the}} so-called [...] "kitchen cabinets" [...] held in Spence's home in which leading loyalist politicians and paramilitaries met to discuss possible strategies for peace.|$|R

25|$|The {{major parties}} {{standing}} were the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) on the Unionist side, and Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) on the Nationalist side. The largest cross-community party, the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, contested {{the election in}} 17 of 18 constituencies. Smaller parties also included the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party,</b> the Green Party and the UK Unionist Party. Some independent Unionists also stood.|$|E
25|$|On 28 August 1996, the UDA's South Belfast Brigadier Alex Kerr, {{and head}} of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade Billy Wright, were {{expelled}} from the Combined Loyalist Military Command and ordered to leave Northern Ireland after the pair had lent their support to a campaign against the Belfast Agreement in general and the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> and Ulster Democratic Party in particular. The campaign was being led by former UDA hitman and Ulster Independence Movement member Pastor Kenny McClinton.|$|E
25|$|In the 2001 general election, Alliance {{proposed}} a pro-Good Friday Agreement {{pact with the}} Ulster Unionist Party {{in the hopes of}} getting UUP support in Belfast East. However the UUP did not agree and so both parties stood. Robinson was re-elected with 42.5% of the vote, with the UUP, Alliance and <b>Progressive</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> carving up the pro-Agreement pro-union vote between them, but it is doubtful that an unopposed Alliance candidate could have consolidated all of that vote to beat Robinson.|$|E

25|$|In June 1973, {{elections}} {{were held to}} a new devolved parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly. The elections split the UUP. Faulkner became chief executive in a power-sharing executive with the SDLP and the middle-of-the-road Alliance Party, a political alliance cemented at the Sunningdale Conference that year. However, the prominence in the Sunningdale Agreement of the cross-border Council of Ireland suggested that Faulkner had strayed too far ahead of his party. A section of the party had previously broken away to form the Vanguard <b>Progressive</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party,</b> which contested the elections {{in opposition to the}} UUP.|$|E
25|$|The DUP {{remained}} the largest {{party in the}} Assembly, making significant gains from the UUP. Sinn Féin made gains from the SDLP and was the largest party among the Nationalists. The only other Assembly Party to make gains was the liberal Alliance Party (winning seven seats, a gain of one), while the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> and independent health campaigner Dr Kieran Deeny retained their single seats, and were joined by the Green Party, which won its first Assembly seat, and increased its first preference votes fourfold from 2003. The UK Unionist Party lost its representation in the Assembly. They had contested 12 seats, with Robert McCartney standing in six of them.|$|E
25|$|As a {{reaction}} to this centre-right alliance, the different liberal democratic and centrist parties intensified cooperation. Five parties drafted a joint statement criticising the current electoral law and proposing a new one. On 16 August 15 political and social movements, some of which defected from the Democratic Alliance for Egypt, announced the Egyptian Bloc electoral alliance. It consisted of liberal, secularist, and centre-left political parties, {{as well as social}} organizations and labour unions, and also the traditional Islamic Sufi Liberation Party. Its main objective was to prevent an imminent electoral victory of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the Freedom and Justice Party. After suffering many defections, the remaining Egyptian Bloc parties were: the Free Egyptians Party, the Egyptian Social Democratic Party and the National <b>Progressive</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> (Tagammu).|$|E
2500|$|On 28 May 2010, the UVF was {{severely}} criticised over {{the murder of}} Moffett. The Independent Monitoring Commission was {{highly critical of the}} leadership for having condoned and even sanctioned the attack, in contrast to praise bestowed on the Brigade Staff for a moderating influence during the marching season. The <b>Progressive</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party's</b> condemnation, and Dawn Purvis and other leaders' resignations {{as a response to the}} Moffett shooting, were also noted. Eleven months later, a 40-year-old man was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of the UVF's alleged second-in-command Harry Stockman, described by the media as a [...] "senior Loyalist figure". Fifty-year-old Stockman was stabbed more than 15 times in a supermarket in the Greater Shankill area; the attack was believed to have been linked to the Moffett killing. However, public opinion suggests that the stabbing was a personal vendetta and any connection being made to the Moffett case was simply a fictitious tale of revenge.|$|R
5000|$|In 1973, Carson {{resigned}} from the Ulster <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> to join the Vanguard <b>Unionist</b> <b>Progressive</b> <b>Party,</b> and immediately elected in the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election for Armagh. [...] Following his election, he joined the Armagh County Executive of Vanguard, and also {{became a member of}} the Monday Club and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.|$|R
50|$|The UUUC was {{established}} in January 1974. It was organised by Harry West and constituted a formal electoral pact between his Ulster <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party,</b> the Democratic <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> and the Vanguard <b>Unionist</b> <b>Progressive</b> <b>Party.</b> West arranged the movement, having gained control of the UUP from Brian Faulkner, to galvanise opposition to power sharing arrangements that were being put in place and to run against Faulkner's Pro-Assembly Unionists who later formed themselves into the <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> of Northern Ireland.|$|R
25|$|Northern Ireland {{currently}} {{has a number}} of pro-union political parties, the largest of which is the traditionalist Democratic Unionist Party led by Arlene Foster, followed by the more moderate Ulster Unionist Party led by Robin Swann. Both parties are active across Northern Ireland. On a smaller level, the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party,</b> which is the political wing of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) paramilitary group, attracts some support in the greater Belfast area. Traditional Unionist Voice is opposed to the current constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland following the Belfast Agreement and St Andrews Agreement. The pluralist Conservative Party is currently allied to the Ulster Unionist Party. While the Alliance Party supports the status quo position of Northern Ireland, it does not define itself as Unionist.|$|E
25|$|The Alliance Party {{performed}} well, {{gaining a}} second seat in East Belfast (which a former <b>Progressive</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> member lost and the PUP failed to regain), while increasing the Alliance vote share significantly. Traditional Unionist Voice secured a single seat in North Antrim; its vote share was {{down from the}} May 2010 elections to the UK Parliament. Despite their first preference vote halving, the Green Party held their sole seat in North Down while the People before Profit Alliance narrowly failed to take the final seat in the Foyle constituency. The only member elected as an independent in 2007 (in West Tyrone) retired, leaving a single independent in the new Assembly (after three independents first elected on other tickets had retired or lost re-election), compared to five {{at the end of}} the previous one.|$|E
25|$|Trimble {{began his}} career as a Professor of Law at The Queen's University of Belfast in the 1970s, during which time he began to get {{involved}} with the paramilitary-linked Vanguard <b>Progressive</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party.</b> He was elected to the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention in 1975, and joined the UUP in 1978 after the VPUP disbanded. Remaining at Queen's University, he continued his academic career until being elected as the MP for Upper Bann in 1990. In 1995 he was unexpectedly elected as the leader of the UUP. He was instrumental in the negotiations that led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, and (along with John Hume) won the Nobel Peace Prize that year for his efforts. He was later elected to become the first First Minister of Northern Ireland, although his tenure was turbulent and frequently interrupted by disagreements over the timetable for Provisional Irish Republican Army decommissioning.|$|E
50|$|Born in County Antrim, Wilson {{attended}} Belfast College of Technology {{before becoming}} a marine engineer. He was elected to Newtownabbey Borough Council in 1975 for the Vanguard <b>Unionist</b> <b>Progressive</b> <b>Party,</b> and joined the Ulster <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> the following year. However, he resigned {{his position on the}} council in 1988. He was UUP General Secretary from the late 1980s until 1998.|$|R
50|$|Overend was a {{prominent}} member of the Vanguard <b>Unionist</b> <b>Progressive</b> <b>Party</b> in the mid-1970s. In 1975, he proposed that the Order formed a new, united <b>unionist</b> <b>party,</b> but this was rejected. He was elected for Vanguard to the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention from Mid Ulster, In 1976, an unsuccessful attempt was made on his life by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA).|$|R
5000|$|The protest resumed on Monday 3 September, {{the first}} day of the Autumn school term. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (over the summer the RUC had {{undergone}} a name change), supported by the British Army, were by then better prepared and managed to force a path through the protesters. Loyalists jeered and shouted sectarian abuse as the children, some as young as four, were escorted into the school by their parents and the police. Stones and bottles were thrown at the children and their parents; one woman was injured. A mother of one of the schoolgirls said: [...] "It was absolutely terrifying. They were shouting 'dirty tramps', 'your kids are animals', 'Fenian scum', 'you Fenian bastards'. And all we were trying to do was get our kids to school". Unionist politicians claimed a [...] "heavy-handed" [...] police presence had inflamed the situation, while the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party's</b> Billy Hutchinson alleged that five known IRA men had been allowed to walk with the children through the Protestant area.|$|R
25|$|Adair's {{men also}} sacked {{the homes of}} Gusty Spence and Winston Churchill Rea {{as part of a}} move to drive the UVF off the Shankill. The UVF struck back on 21 August, killing two of Adair's allies, Jackie Coulter and Bobby Mahood, on the Crumlin Road. In response, C Company members burned down the {{headquarters}} of the UVF-linked <b>Progressive</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> (PUP). Adair was arrested on 22 August 2000 whilst he and Dodds were driving down the Shankill Road. As a result of his involvement in the violence, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Mandelson revoked Adair's early release and returned him to prison. This time he was sent to Maghaberry instead of the Maze. With command reverting to Dodds, UVF member Samuel Rockett was shot and killed at his home by C Company the following night, with the feud petering out after this.|$|E
25|$|Many {{constituencies}} were contested by other, smaller parties. Parties {{that won}} no representatives at Westminster in 2005 but have {{seats in the}} devolved assemblies or European Parliament included the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> of Northern Ireland, the British National Party, the UK Independence Party (UKIP), and the Green parties in the UK: the Green Party of England and Wales, the Scottish Green Party, and the Green Party in Northern Ireland. In 2009, Nigel Farage announced his intention to resign as UKIP leader to focus on becoming an MP. Farage was replaced in an election by party members by Lord Pearson of Rannoch, whose stated intention was for the electoral support of UKIP to force a hung parliament. The Green Party of England and Wales voted to have a position of leader for the first time; the first leadership election was won by Caroline Lucas, who successfully contested the constituency of Brighton Pavilion.|$|E
25|$|The Drumcree conflict, {{stemming}} from an Orange Order protest at Drumcree Church after their parade had been banned from marching through the predominantly nationalist Catholic Garvaghy area of Portadown, {{returned to the}} headlines in 1995 with trouble expected in Wright's Portadown stronghold. Just before the July marching season Irish government representative Fergus Finlay held a meeting with Wright in which the latter pledged his loyalty {{to the peace process}} and David Ervine in particular, although Wright also warned Finlay that loyalist views had to be respected. Cracks began to show however as Wright felt that the UVF response to the trouble had been inordinately low-key whilst his taste for the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> (PUP) strategy also began to wane as the party moved increasingly towards a form of socialism, an ideology repugnant to Wright. A further problem arose when Wright, who by that time was a popular loyalist figure across Northern Ireland, travelled to the Shankill Road in Belfast in late 1995 to try to overturn a ban preventing an Orange Order parade entering a neighbouring Catholic area. Wright had hoped to bring local UVF units onto the streets of the Shankill to force an overturning of the ban but the Shankill commanders refused to put their units at Wright's disposal, having assured the British authorities that they would not in a series of secret negotiations. Wright returned to Portadown in disgust, accusing the Belfast UVF of having surrendered. Nonetheless, when Wright was arrested in late 1995 for intimidation he was still on good terms with the UVF, whose magazine Combat called for his release.|$|E
