5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of retinopathy of <b>prematurity</b> in infants is typically {{suggested by the}} clinical setting. <b>Prematurity,</b> low birth weight {{and a history of}} oxygen exposure are the principal indicators, while no hereditary factors have been shown to yield a pattern.|$|E
5|$|Important {{sexual health}} issues for women include Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) and {{female genital cutting}} (FGC). STIs are a global health priority because they have serious consequences for women and infants. Mother-to-child transmission of STIs can lead to stillbirths, neonatal death, low-birth-weight and <b>prematurity,</b> sepsis, pneumonia, neonatal conjunctivitis, and congenital deformities. Syphilis in pregnancy results in over 300,000 fetal and neonatal deaths per year, and 215,000 infants with {{an increased risk of}} death from <b>prematurity,</b> low-birth-weight or congenital disease.|$|E
5|$|Retinopathy of <b>prematurity</b> may regress spontaneously, {{but should}} the disease {{progress}} beyond a threshold (defined as five contiguous or eight cumulative hours of stage 3 retinopathy of <b>prematurity),</b> both cryosurgery and laser surgery {{have been shown}} {{to reduce the risk of}} blindness as an outcome. Where the disease has progressed further, techniques such as scleral buckling and vitrectomy surgery may assist in re-attaching the retina.|$|E
5|$|Retinopathy of <b>prematurity</b> was not {{observed}} before World War II, but with the availability of supplemental oxygen in the decade following, it rapidly {{became one of the}} principal causes of infant blindness in developed countries. By 1960 the use of oxygen had become identified as a risk factor and its administration restricted. The resulting fall in retinopathy of <b>prematurity</b> was accompanied by a rise in infant mortality and hypoxia-related complications. Since then, more sophisticated monitoring and diagnosis have established protocols for oxygen use which aim to balance between hypoxic conditions and problems of retinopathy of <b>prematurity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to high inspired fractions of oxygen causes {{damage to the}} retina. Damage to the developing eye of infants exposed to high oxygen fraction at normal pressure has a different mechanism and effect from the eye damage experienced by adult divers under hyperbaric conditions. Hyperoxia may be a contributing factor for the disorder called retrolental fibroplasia or retinopathy of <b>prematurity</b> (ROP) in infants. In preterm infants, the retina is often not fully vascularised. Retinopathy of <b>prematurity</b> occurs {{when the development of}} the retinal vasculature is arrested and then proceeds abnormally. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a risk factor, is not the main risk factor for development of this disease. Restricting supplemental oxygen use does not necessarily reduce the rate of retinopathy of <b>prematurity,</b> and may raise the risk of hypoxia-related systemic complications.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevention}} of oxygen toxicity depends {{entirely on the}} setting. Both underwater and in space, proper precautions can eliminate the most pernicious effects. Premature infants commonly require supplemental oxygen to treat complications of preterm birth. In this case {{prevention of}} bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of <b>prematurity</b> {{must be carried out}} without compromising a supply of oxygen adequate to preserve the infant's life.|$|E
5|$|A {{pregnant}} woman's elevated {{blood lead}} level can lead to miscarriage, <b>prematurity,</b> low birth weight, and problems with development during childhood. Lead is able {{to pass through the}} placenta and into breast milk, and {{blood lead level}}s in mothers and infants are usually similar. A fetus may be poisoned in utero if lead from the mother's bones is subsequently mobilized by the changes in metabolism due to pregnancy; increased calcium intake in pregnancy may help mitigate this phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Retinopathy of <b>prematurity</b> (ROP) {{in infants}} {{frequently}} regresses without intervention and eyesight may be normal in later years. Where {{the disease has}} progressed to the stages requiring surgery, the outcomes are generally good {{for the treatment of}} stage 3 ROP, but are much worse for the later stages. Although surgery is usually successful in restoring the anatomy of the eye, damage to the nervous system by the progression of the disease leads to comparatively poorer results in restoring vision. The presence of other complicating diseases also reduces the likelihood of a favourable outcome.|$|E
5|$|Schuur {{has been}} blind from birth due to {{retinopathy}} of <b>prematurity,</b> {{but has been}} gifted with absolute pitch memory and a clear vocal tone. In 1996, she was a guest performer on Sesame Street, where she was interviewed by Elmo and described to him how a blind person can learn to use other senses to adapt in the world. In 2000 she was awarded the Helen Keller Achievement Award by the American Foundation for the Blind.|$|E
5|$|Schuur {{was born}} in Tacoma, Washington, two months {{premature}} and weighing less than three pounds. Complications of <b>prematurity</b> resulted in her total loss of vision. Her twin brother, David, had normal vision at birth but some hearing loss. She also has an older sister. Schuur grew up in Auburn, Washington, a southern suburb of Seattle. She attended the Washington School for the Blind in Vancouver from age four to eleven. She lived at school but was able to commute home 150miles on the train by herself. She later transferred to public school where teachers' aides helped her keep up in class.|$|E
25|$|Apnea of <b>prematurity</b> as {{a primary}} treatment, but not prevention.|$|E
25|$|Swallowing {{difficulties}} such as with <b>prematurity</b> {{and coordination}} of sucking, swallowing and breathing, or gastro-intestinal tract abnormalities like tracheo-oesophageal fistula.|$|E
25|$|Some {{systemic}} {{conditions may}} cause delayed tooth development, such as nutritional factors, endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism, hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism), undiagnosed and untreated celiac disease, anemia, <b>prematurity,</b> low birth weight, renal failure, heavy metal intoxication or tobacco smoke, among others.|$|E
25|$|An IVF-associated {{incidence}} of cerebral palsy and neurodevelopmental delay {{are believed to}} be related to the confounders of <b>prematurity</b> and low birthweight. Similarly, an IVF-associated {{incidence of}} autism and attention-deficit disorder {{are believed to be}} related to confounders of maternal and obstetric factors.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, SSRIs inhibit {{nitric oxide}} synthesis, which plays an {{important}} role in setting vascular tone. Several studies have pointed to an increased risk of <b>prematurity</b> associated with SSRI use, and this association may be due to an increase risk of pre-eclampsia of pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Madeline died {{unexpectedly}} in April 2009 due to complications {{related to}} her <b>prematurity.</b> Since then Heather has continued to chronicle her family’s story as they journey through grief, and has given a voice to families who have suffered the devastation of losing a child.|$|E
25|$|Navy {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York in 1953. Born premature, she was {{diagnosed}} as totally blind from retinopathy of <b>prematurity.</b> Her family soon discovered that she could actually see {{from the corner of}} one eye, but at age 10 she lost all sight due to retinal detachment.|$|E
25|$|The {{consensus}} concerning monoamniotic twins (identical twins sharing an amniotic sac), {{the highest}} risk type of twins, {{is that they}} should be delivered by caesarean section at or shortly after 32 weeks, since the risks of intrauterine death of one or both twins is higher after this gestation than the risk of complications of <b>prematurity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most {{women who}} use cocaine while {{pregnant}} use other drugs too; {{one study found}} that 93% of those who use cocaine or opiates also use tobacco, marijuana, or alcohol. When researchers control for use of other drugs, many of the seeming effects of cocaine on head size, birth weight, Apgar scores, and <b>prematurity</b> disappear.|$|E
25|$|While newborns {{who were}} exposed prenatally to {{drugs such as}} {{barbiturates}} or heroin frequently have symptoms of drug withdrawal (neonatal abstinence syndrome), this does not happen with babies exposed to crack in utero; at least, such symptoms are difficult to separate {{in the context of}} other factors such as <b>prematurity</b> or prenatal exposure to other drugs.|$|E
25|$|In {{those who}} are born with a weight between 1kg and 1.5kg CP occurs in 6%. Among those born before 28weeks of {{gestation}} it occurs in 11%. Genetic factors are believed {{to play an important}} role in <b>prematurity</b> and cerebral palsy generally. While in {{those who are}} born between 34 and 37weeks the risk is 0.4% (three times normal).|$|E
25|$|Caffeine {{can have}} both {{positive}} and negative health effects. It can treat and prevent the premature infant breathing disorders bronchopulmonary dysplasia of <b>prematurity</b> and apnea of <b>prematurity.</b> Caffeine citrate is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. It may confer a modest protective effect against some diseases, including Parkinson's disease. Some people experience insomnia or sleep disruption if they consume caffeine, especially during the evening hours, but others show little disturbance. Evidence of a risk during pregnancy is equivocal; some authorities recommend that pregnant women limit consumption to the equivalent of two cups of coffee per day or less. Caffeine can produce a mild form of drug dependence– associated with withdrawal symptoms such as sleepiness, headache, and irritability– when an individual stops using caffeine after repeated daily intake. Tolerance to the autonomic effects of increased blood pressure and heart rate, and increased urine output, develops with chronic use (i.e., these symptoms become less pronounced or do not occur following consistent use).|$|E
25|$|Another {{feature of}} {{kangaroo}} care was early discharge in the kangaroo position despite <b>prematurity.</b> It has proven successful in improving survival rates of premature and {{low birth weight}} newborns and in lowering the risks of nosocomial infection, severe illness, and lower respiratory tract disease (Conde-Agudelo, Diaz-Rossello, & Belizan, 2003). It also increased exclusive breast feeding and for a longer duration and improved maternal satisfaction and confidence.|$|E
25|$|Rubella {{can cause}} {{congenital}} rubella syndrome in the newborn. The syndrome (CRS) follows intrauterine infection by the rubella virus and comprises cardiac, cerebral, ophthalmic and auditory defects. It may also cause <b>prematurity,</b> low birth weight, and neonatal thrombocytopenia, anemia and hepatitis. The risk of major defects or organogenesis is highest for infection in the first trimester. CRS {{is the main reason}} a vaccine for rubella was developed.|$|E
25|$|Blood vessel {{contraction}} {{can also}} cause premature labor and premature birth. Cocaine has also been found to enhance the contractility of the tissue in the uterus, another factor that has been suggested as a possible mechanism for its contribution to increased <b>prematurity</b> rates. Increased contractility of the uterus may also be behind the increased likelihood of placental abruption (the placenta tearing away from the uterine wall) which some findings have linked with PCE.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of affected children present with symptoms and signs {{relating to the}} eyes such as leukokoria, redness, irritation and impaired vision, which result from retinal detachment and glaucoma. A minority present with seizures or spasticity. The time of onset of symptoms varies from infancy to adolescence. Because a child born before term will need to undergo screening for retinopathy of <b>prematurity,</b> some will have abnormalities in their retinal blood vessels detected when they have no symptoms yet.|$|E
25|$|It is {{recommended}} that women with vasa previa should deliver through elective cesarean prior to rupture of the membranes. Given the timing of membrane rupture is difficult to predict, elective cesarean delivery at 35–36 weeks {{is recommended}}. This gestational age gives a reasonable balance between {{the risk of death}} and that of <b>prematurity.</b> Several authorities have recommended hospital admission about 32 weeks. This is to give the patient proximity to the operating room for emergency delivery should the membranes rupture. Because these patients are at risk for preterm delivery, it {{is recommended that}} steroids should be given to promote fetal lung maturation. When bleeding occurs, the patient goes into labor, or if the membranes rupture, immediate treatment with an emergency caesarean delivery is usually indicated.|$|E
500|$|Retinopathy of <b>prematurity</b> {{is largely}} {{preventable}} by screening. Current guidelines require that all babies {{of less than}} 32weeks gestational age or having a birth weight less than [...] should be screened for retinopathy of <b>prematurity</b> at least every two weeks. The National Cooperative Study in 1954 showed a causal link between supplemental oxygen and retinopathy of <b>prematurity,</b> but subsequent curtailment of supplemental oxygen caused an increase in infant mortality. To balance the risks of hypoxia and retinopathy of <b>prematurity,</b> modern protocols now require monitoring of blood oxygen levels in premature infants receiving oxygen.|$|E
500|$|The primary {{diagnosis}} {{for children}} in hospice treatment is cancer, but, like the adult population, children may enter hospice {{for a variety of}} conditions, including AIDS, <b>prematurity,</b> congenital disorder, cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, or [...] "death-inducing trauma", such as automobile accidents. Hospice care, which is intended to treat the whole family, may also be made available to families expecting a child who is not anticipated to survive long after delivery.|$|E
500|$|In 1997 {{a summary}} of studies of {{neonatal}} intensive care units in industrialised countries showed that up to 60% of low birth weight babies developed retinopathy of <b>prematurity,</b> which rose to 72% in extremely low birth weight babies, defined as less than [...] at birth. However, severe outcomes are much less frequent: for very low birth weight babies—those less than [...] at birth—the incidence of blindness {{was found to be}} no more than 8%.|$|E
500|$|In {{premature}} babies, {{signs of}} damage to the eye (retinopathy of <b>prematurity,</b> or ROP) are observed via an ophthalmoscope as a demarcation between the [...] and non-vascularised regions of an infant's retina. The degree of this demarcation is used to designate four stages: (I) the demarcation is a line; (II) the demarcation becomes a ridge; (III) growth of new blood vessels occurs around the ridge; (IV) the retina begins to detach from the inner wall of the eye (choroid).|$|E
500|$|Schuur {{received}} a financial settlement from her birth hospital for her loss of vision. <b>Prematurity</b> itself {{is associated with}} blindness, {{but it was not}} universally known {{at the time of her}} birth that high levels of oxygen in a neonatal incubator can have a negative effect on the developing retinas of the eyes, thereby increasing the incidence of blindness. The settlement money helped her to buy a house in later years. Schuur was called [...] "Deedle-Babes", [...] "Deeds" [...] and other variations of this name by her mother, who died of cancer at age 31. [...] "Deedles" [...] is the nickname which stuck and became the title of one of her early albums.|$|E
500|$|Though {{he was an}} {{obstetrician}} {{rather than}} a pediatrician, DeLee became the greatest advocate of the infant incubator in the U.S. At that time, obstetricians dealt {{with the problems of}} the premature baby after birth, where pediatricians were likely to only see the survivors of <b>prematurity</b> many days later. The pediatricians – influenced by their experiences taking care of other types of malnourished children – thought it was essential for the babies to be exposed to sunlight. For most pediatricians, it seemed counterintuitive to enclose the babies in a box. By 1901, DeLee had built an entire incubator transport service staffed with specially trained nurses, but costs were high and maternity hospitals still did not attract many private patients. The funds ran out on the incubator station in 1908.|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{have found}} after {{controlling}} for other factors that some effects are present in pregnancies involving cocaine: abruptio placenta, <b>prematurity,</b> low birth weight, and small size compared to babies of the same gestational time. PCE newborns have smaller heads and shorter bodies. [...] PCE effects are more severe when the amounts of cocaine are greater. As many as 17–27% of cocaine-using pregnant women deliver prematurely. In association with <b>prematurity,</b> growth in the womb is reduced, and low birth weight is connected to PCE. There are also data showing that spontaneous abortion is associated with cocaine use. Cocaine reduces the appetite and has been linked with reduced maternal weight gain during pregnancy; in addition, constriction of the blood vessels may further limit supply of nutrients to the fetus. Using cocaine while pregnant also heightens the chances of maternal and fetal vitamin deficiencies, ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 1904, Rohmer married Marie Louise Kieffer (1880–1962), {{with whom}} he had three children: [...] Laurent (in 1904), Anne-Marie (in 1906), and Marie-Thérèse (in 1908). The third child died a few weeks after her birth due to an unknown infection. This {{reinforced}} the single-mindedness of Rohmer to fight against the birth-death rate and <b>prematurity.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 2000 {{the state}} {{implemented}} the Vermont Child Health Improvement Program to improve preventive services {{and management of}} chronic conditions. In 2011, the state ranked third {{in the nation in}} child health system performance. In 2011, the March of Dimes gave Vermont an [...] "A," [...] ranking it number one in the country on its <b>Prematurity</b> Report Card.|$|E
