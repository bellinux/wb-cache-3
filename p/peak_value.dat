The cycle of phosphorus in nature, in water and issue of the eutrophication is described in this thesis as well as basic characteristics of three monitored subcatchments. The concentration of phosphorus, flow rate and precipitation was measured in these three monitored subcatchments. <b>Peak</b> <b>values</b> of phosphorus concentration and possible impact of rainfall-runoff occurrences on these <b>peak</b> <b>values</b> are as well analyzed in this thesis. This research uses statistical methods. The final part of this thesis assesses the impact of rainfall-runoff occurrences on the <b>peak</b> <b>values</b> of phosphorus concentration.

25|$|The {{period between}} {{exposure}} to methylmercury {{and the appearance}} of symptoms in adult poisoning cases is long. The longest recorded latent period is five months after a single exposure, in the Dartmouth case (see History); other latent periods in the range of weeks to months have also been reported. No explanation for this long latent period is known. When the first symptom appears, typically paresthesia (a tingling or numbness in the skin), it is followed rapidly by more severe effects, sometimes ending in coma and death. The toxic damage appears to be determined by the <b>peak</b> <b>value</b> of mercury, not the length of the exposure.|$|E
25|$|The {{velocity}} of a tsunami {{can be calculated}} by obtaining the square root of {{the depth of the}} water in metres multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (approximated to 10m/s2). For example, if the Pacific Ocean is considered to have a depth of 5000 metres, the {{velocity of}} a tsunami would be the square root of √(5000 × 10) = √50000 = ~224 metres per second (735 feet per second), which equates to a speed of ~806 kilometres per hour or about 500 miles per hour. This formula is the same as used for calculating the velocity of shallow waves, because a tsunami behaves like a shallow wave as it peak to <b>peak</b> <b>value</b> reaches from the floor of the ocean to the surface.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{previously}} {{believed that}} the skin was an effective barrier to inorganic particles. Damage from mechanical stressors {{was believed to be}} the only way to increase its permeability. Recently, however, simpler and more effective methods for increasing skin permeability have been developed. For example, ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has been used to slightly damage the surface of skin, causing a time-dependent defect allowing easier penetration of nanoparticles. The UVR’s high energy causes a restructuring of cells, weakening the boundary between the stratum corneum and the epidermal layer. The damage of the skin is typically measured by the transepidermal water loss (TEWL), though it may take 3–5 days for the TEWL to reach its <b>peak</b> <b>value.</b> When the TEWL reaches its highest value, the maximum density of nanoparticles is able to permeate the skin. Studies confirm that UVR damaged skin significantly increases the permeability. The effects of increased permeability after UVR exposure can lead to an increase in the number of particles that permeate the skin. However, the specific permeability of skin after UVR exposure relative to particles of different sizes and materials has not been determined.|$|E

The hardest hit areas were in Jackson and Victoria counties where the heaviest rains fell. In these areas, flooding and strong winds damaged the cotton and rice crops; however, effects of the rice crop were more limited due to losses from earlier storms as well as ongoing harvesting. Some flooding also took place across the Atascosa River watershed, but no damage resulted. Overall, property damage was estimated at $150,000 while agricultural losses reached $600,000.|$|E
500|$|Garber {{compared}} the available price data on tulips to hyacinth {{prices at the}} beginning of the 19th century—when the hyacinth replaced the tulip as the fashionable flower—and found a similar pattern. When hyacinths were introduced florists strove with one another to grow beautiful hyacinth flowers, as demand was strong. However, as people became more accustomed to hyacinths the prices began to fall. The most expensive bulbs fell to 1 to 2percent of their <b>peak</b> <b>value</b> within 30years. Garber also notes that, [...] "a small quantity of prototype lily bulbs recently was sold for 1million guilders ($US480,000 at 1987 exchange rates)", demonstrating that even in the modern world, flowers can command extremely high prices. Because the rise in prices occurred after bulbs were planted for the year, growers would not have had an opportunity to increase production in response to price.|$|E

40|$|Significance of {{measurement}} of vancomycin peak serum concentrations The glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin is frequently used in Gram-positive infections. Still, until today, much controversy exists about possible toxicity, especially as concerns {{the significance of}} <b>peak</b> <b>values</b> in therapeutic drug monitoring. According to American guidelines published in 1998 and several other authors, <b>peak</b> <b>values</b> are useless. A retrospective analysis at the university hospitals of Leuven reveals that a minority of <b>peak</b> <b>values</b> (9, 8 %) exceeded the possibly toxic value of 50 mg/l. One third of these possibly toxic values correlated with a high trough value (> 15 mg/l) {{and would have been}} detected anyway. "Missed" possibly toxic <b>peaks</b> are <b>peak</b> <b>values</b> which exceed the arbitrary value of 50 mg/l although preceded by a normal trough <b>value.</b> These <b>peaks</b> occurred especially at a 1000 mg vancomycin dose and in patients with a good renal function.

500|$|The JTWC {{estimated}} Cimaron to {{have been}} a stronger system, attaining its peak intensity as a Category5-equivalent super typhoon with one-minute winds of 260km/h (160mph). However, satellite estimates from forecasters within the agency itself, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB), the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), and Dr. Karl Hoarau of Cergy-Pontoise University stated Cimaron {{to have been}} an even stronger system. Using the Dvorak technique [...] a method of determining a tropical cyclone's intensity based on satellite appearance [...] AFWA and SAB yielded a <b>peak</b> <b>value</b> of T7.5, 285km/h (180mph), while advanced operational values from the JTWC peaked at T7.8, 305km/h (190mph). Additionally, a forecaster at SAB noted that the lower estimates were likely due to restrictions on the Dvorak technique stemming from Cimaron's rapid intensification. The forecaster also noted that a second type of estimate gave a maximum value of T8.0, 315km/h (195mph), the highest rating on the scale.|$|E

Accumulations of [...] were common across {{the states of}} Hidalgo, Nuevo León, San Luis Potosí, Tamaulipas, and Veracruz, with a <b>peak</b> <b>value</b> of [...] in La Encantada, Tamaulipas. Flooding in Tamaulipas prompted residents to evacuate and utilize public shelters. A roof collapse at a ballpark injured two people. Damage to roads across the state amounted to 80million pesos (US$6million); however, no single road suffered major damage. Losses from heavy rain in El Mante reached 7million pesos (US$500,000), prompting a state of emergency. Some residences temporarily lost power across Tamaulipas. Road collapses in Veracruz City damaged ten homes and four cars. One of these further threatened 40homes in Infonavit Buena Vista within the city. A rockslide occurred in the remote community of El Tecomate. Flooding in Guanajuato caused notable disruptions and some damage.

Copious rainfall was recorded in southwestern parts of New Brunswick, with [...] measured at Gagetown. Flooding at Saint John, New Brunswick made two local streets inaccessible, while winds downed electrical poles in Fredericton. In Onslow, Nova Scotia, firefighters rescued a man trapped under a tree limb, while a sailboat capsized at Charlottetown harbor and another was washed out to sea. The hurricane forced temporary suspension of the MV Nova Star ferry service between Yarmouth, Nova Scotia and Portland, Maine. The storm caused flight delays and cancellations at Halifax Stanfield International Airport, while LaHave and Tancook Island ferries were shut down; in addition, access to the A. Murray MacKay Bridge was restricted to smaller vehicles. In Stratford, Prince Edward Island, a woman died after being struck by a door that was caught by a gust of wind, and in Woodstock, New Brunswick, a man died when his oxygen support was cut off during a power outage. In some parts of Nova Scotia, damage to the electrical grid was reported to be the worst since Hurricane Juan in 2003.
