5|$|In November 2014, Adam is {{revealed}} to be recovering from multiple facial reconstruction surgeries, {{and is in the}} care of Sage Warner (Kelly Sullivan). When Adam is told of Chelsea and Billy's new relationship, he attempts to leave his current dwelling, with Sage assuring him that he is not ready and that any attempt to leave would only compromise the progress of the surgeries he'd recently had. Adam eventually recovers enough to have the bandages removed from his face; after the bandages are removed it {{is revealed}} that his face had been replaced by Gabriel Bingham; the man who died saving Adam's life, he returns to Genoa City with Sage, he comes across the people he knows, but none of them recognize Adam or get the feeling that they know him somehow. Adam, under the alias of Gabriel, would pose as being married to Sage, in a ruse to claim Gabe's inheritance from Constance, however, they would later divorce in April 2015. He would reconnect with Chelsea, whom he confessed his true identity, and would slowly begin to piece their life back together, with plans to relocate to Paris, until Victor stepped in to sue for custody of Connor, keeping them in Genoa City. In October 2015, Adam's true identity was revealed and would help Sage deliver his nephew in Chancellor Park, following a heated confrontation between the two. Adam would stand trial for his role in Delia's death. He was sentenced for ten years, and upon leaving the courthouse, was run over by an unknown assailant. Christine found out that the car is found at the south lake motel. The car was found out to be a rental and Kevin found a surveillance picture that showed that Chloe was behind the <b>pedal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> metal. Adam regains consciousness after the surgery, and expresses no ill will towards Chloe.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} allow the {{powertrain}} computer to optimize performance under every driving condition, the Insight’s accelerator pedal is a “drive-by-wire” type that uses an electronic position sensor instead of the conventional metal cable that usually connects the <b>pedal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> engine’s throttle body. In the drive-by-wire system, the engine’s throttle body {{is controlled by the}} powertrain computer in response to the accelerator pedal position—allowing the computer to determine the optimal throttle body, fuel, and CVT settings based on the accelerator pedal position and its rate of travel.|$|E

500|$|Although many {{reviews of}} St. Anger were positive, some reviewers {{had a strong}} distaste for the album. Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork {{strongly}} disliked the album and criticized Ulrich and Hammett, saying that Ulrich was [...] "playing a drum set consisting of steel drums, aluminum toms, programmed double kicks, and a broken church bell. The kit's high-end clamor ignored {{the basic principles of}} drumming: timekeeping," [...] he added, [...] "Hetfield and Hammett's guitars underwent more processing than cat food. When they both speedstrummed through 'St. Anger', and most other movements, [...] seemed to overwhelm each other with different, terrible noise. Also the duration of most songs made it boring to hear them." [...] Playlouder reviewer William Luff cited the album's 75-minute length and sound ("a monolithic slab of noise") as reasoning that St. Anger was [...] "just too dense and daunting to be truly enjoyable." [...] PopMatters reporter Michael Christopher said [...] "St. Anger dispenses with the recent spate of radio friendly pleasantries in favor of <b>pedal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor thrash, staggered and extended song structures, quick changes and a muddled production that tries to harken back to the Kill 'Em All days. All attempts fail miserably." ...|$|E
2500|$|Christensen {{received}} a Marshall 4x12 G1275 amplifier {{from his parents}} for his 18th birthday, which helped him write heavier music and would shortly thereafter result in the riff to the hit song [...] "Waterline". Their style would frequently be compared to Led Zeppelin and Pearl Jam, even though critics admitted that [...] "the trio wants—and inexplicably even manages—to create their own musical identity." [...] This style would become known as power rock, which the band would later also use to describe their genre and which they were more comfortable with than the label [...] "grunge", explaining: [...] "We are not so wild about the descriptor grunge, as {{it has become a}} predicate for a variety of dimensions. We focus on the music, not the descriptions. What we play is genuine, vivid, and with the energy in high gear." [...] As a reviewer would put it: [...] " [...] 'Grunge light' perhaps - but well-composed, well-acted, engaging and above all different and personal. Dizzy Mizz Lizzy had the <b>pedal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> metal, and it did something." [...] Christensen explains: [...] "It's like The Police, who came out of the punk-wave without being punk, and still did well. It's the same with us. We came out of the grunge-wave, without being grunge." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{the motor}} vehicle is {{stationary}} and in neutral (N), the driver can select D for drive (after first pressing the foot brake pedal). The transmission's reverse gear is selected {{on the first}} shaft K1, and the outer clutch K2 engages {{at the start of}} the bite point. At the same time, on the alternate gear shaft, the reverse gear clutch K1 is also selected (pre-selected), as the gearbox doesn't know whether the driver wants to go forward or reverse. The clutch pack for second gear (K2) gets ready to engage. When the driver releases the brake pedal, the K2 clutch pack increases the clamping force, allowing the second gear to take up the drive through an increase of the bite point, and thereby transferring the torque from the engine through the transmission to the drive shafts and road wheels, causing the vehicle to move forward. Depressing the accelerator pedal engages the clutch and causes an increase of forward vehicle speed. Pressing the throttle <b>pedal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor (hard acceleration) will cause the gearbox to [...] "kick down" [...] to first gear to provide the acceleration associated with first, although there will be a slight hesitation while the gearbox deselects second gear and selects first gear. As the vehicle accelerates, the transmission's computer determines when the second gear (which is connected to the second clutch) should be fully used. Depending on the vehicle speed and amount of engine power being requested by the driver (determined by the position of the throttle pedal), the DSG then up-shifts. During this sequence, the DSG disengages the first outer clutch whilst simultaneously engaging the second inner clutch (all power from the engine is now going through the second shaft), thus completing the shift sequence. This sequence happens in 8milliseconds (aided by pre-selection), and can happen even with full throttle opening, and as a result, there is virtually no power loss.|$|E

In vehicle suspensions, bellcranks are used in pushrod-style suspensions in automobiles or in the Christie suspension in tanks. Vertically-mounted suspensions may not be feasible in some vehicle designs due to space, aerodynamic, or other design constraints; bellcranks translate the vertical motion of the wheel in to horizontal motion, allowing the suspension to be mounted transversely or longitudinally within the vehicle.|$|E

25|$|The velocipede's renaissance {{began in}} Paris {{during the late}} 1860s.

2500|$|Like a fixed wing aircraft, the A-4 was {{controlled}} with ailerons and elevators {{connected to a}} control column and <b>the</b> rudder <b>to</b> <b>pedals.</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> pilot's right there was a lever which enabled <b>the</b> rotor <b>to</b> be connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> engine via reducing gears for jump starts and to ease heavy landings.

[...] The A-4's fixed undercarriage had wheels on pairs of hinged V struts from the lower fuselage longerons with vertical legs, fitted with faired rubber shock absorbers, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> forward wing spar immediately below the wing strut.

2500|$|The WC, {{with many}} good {{features}} and various first-to-market attributes, {{had at least}} a few drawbacks. Its clutch was not particularly well designed, and, like other tractors of the 1920s through mid-1930s, it lacked usability in the design of its brake controls, with a hand lever {{on each side of the}} tractor, which meant that applying the brakes took the operator's hands away from other controls. Other tractors had foot pedals on both sides, but that meant that the clutch and left brake could not be operated simultaneously. The solution came in the late 30s, when [...] various brands moved both brake <b>pedals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right foot.|$|R
