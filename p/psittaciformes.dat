5|$|No {{consensus}} existed {{regarding the}} taxonomy of <b>Psittaciformes</b> until recently. The {{placement of the}} Strigopoidea species has been variable in the past. They were once {{considered part of the}} Psittacoidea, but recent 21st-century studies place this group of New Zealand species as their own superfamily next to the Cacatuoidea and remaining members of the Psittacoidea. Many studies have confirmed the unique placement of this group {{at the base of the}} parrot tree. Most authors now recognize this group as a separate taxon containing two families: Nestoridae and Strigopidae. Conversely, the relationships among various cockatoo genera are largely resolved.|$|E

25|$|Australia and its territories {{are home}} to around 800 species of bird; about 350 of these are endemic to the zoogeographic region that covers Australia, New Guinea and New Zealand. The fossil record of birds in Australia is patchy; however, there are records of the {{ancestors}} of contemporary species {{as early as the}} Late Oligocene. Birds with a Gondwanan history include the flightless ratites (the emu and southern cassowary), megapodes (the malleefowl and Australian brush-turkey), and a huge group of endemic parrots, order <b>Psittaciformes.</b> Australian parrots comprise a sixth of the world's parrots, including many cockatoos and galahs. The kookaburra is the largest species of the kingfisher family, known for its call, which sounds uncannily like loud, echoing human laughter.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species of}} birds are tetrachromatic, with {{dedicated}} cone cells for perceiving wavelengths in the ultraviolet and violet regions of the light spectrum. These cells contain a combination of short wave sensitive (SWS1) opsins, SWS1-like opsins (SWS2), and long-wave filtering carotenoid pigments for selectively filtering and receiving light between 300 and 400 nm. There {{are two types of}} short wave color vision in birds: violet sensitive (VS) and ultraviolet sensitive (UVS). Single nucleotide substitutions in the SWS1 opsin sequence are responsible blue-shifting the spectral sensitivity of the opsin from violet sensitive (λmax = 400) to ultraviolet sensitive (λmax = 310-360). This is the proposed evolutionary mechanism by which ultraviolet vision originally arose. The major clades of birds that have UVS vision are Palaeognathae (ratites and tinamous), Charadriiformes (shorebirds, gulls, and alcids), Trogoniformes (trogons), <b>Psittaciformes</b> (parrots), and Passeriformes (perching birds, representing {{more than half of all}} avian species).|$|E

500|$|A {{cockatoo}} is {{a parrot}} that is {{any of the}} 21 species belonging to the bird family Cacatuidae, the only family in the superfamily Cacatuoidea. Along with the Psittacoidea (true parrots) and the Strigopoidea (large New Zealand parrots), they make up the order <b>Psittaciformes</b> (parrots). The family has a mainly Australasian distribution, ranging from the Philippines and the eastern Indonesian islands of Wallacea to New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Australia.|$|E
500|$|Parrots, {{also known}} as psittacines (...) , are the 402 species of birds {{that make up the}} order <b>Psittaciformes,</b> found in most {{tropical}} and subtropical regions, of which 387 are extant. The order is subdivided into three superfamilies: the Psittacoidea ("true" [...] parrots), the Cacatuoidea (cockatoos), and the Strigopoidea (New Zealand parrots). Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several species inhabiting temperate regions in the Southern Hemisphere as well. The greatest diversity of parrots is in South America and Australasia.|$|E
2500|$|It is now {{generally}} {{assumed that}} the <b>Psittaciformes,</b> or their common ancestors with several related bird orders, were present {{somewhere in the world}} around the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event (K-Pg extinction), some 66Mya. If so, they probably had not evolved their morphological autapomorphies yet, but were generalised arboreal birds. The combined evidence supported the hypothesis of <b>Psittaciformes</b> being [...] "near passerines", i. e., the mostly terrestrial birds that emerged in close proximity to the K-Pg extinction. Analysis of transposable element insertions observed in the genomes of passerines and parrots, but not in the genomes of other birds, provides strong evidence that parrots are the sister group of passerines, forming a clade Psittacopasserae, to the exclusion of the next closest group, the falcons.|$|E
2500|$|Parrots, {{also known}} as psittacines , are birds of the roughly 393 species in 92 genera {{that make up the}} order <b>Psittaciformes,</b> found in most {{tropical}} and subtropical regions.

2500|$|Fossils {{assignable}} to <b>Psittaciformes</b> (though not yet {{the present-day}} parrots) date from slightly {{later in the}} Eocene, starting around 50Mya. Several fairly complete skeletons of parrot-like birds {{have been found in}} England and Germany. [...] Some uncertainty remains, but on the whole it seems more likely that these are not direct ancestors of the modern parrots, but related lineages that evolved in the Northern Hemisphere and have since died out. These are probably not [...] "missing links" [...] between ancestral and modern parrots, but rather psittaciform lineages that evolved parallel to true parrots and cockatoos and had their own peculiar autapomorphies: ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Psittaciformes</b> {{comprise}} {{three main}} lineages: Strigopoidea, Psittacoidea and Cacatuoidea. The Strigopoidea were {{considered part of}} the Psittacoidea, but recent studies place this group of New Zealand species {{at the base of the}} parrot tree next to the remaining members of the Psittacoidea, as well as all members of the Cacatuoidea. The Cacatuoidea are quite distinct, having a movable head crest, a different arrangement of the carotid arteries, a gall bladder, differences in the skull bones, and lack the Dyck texture feathers that—in the Psittacidae—scatter light to produce the vibrant colours of so many parrots. Colourful feathers with high levels of psittacofulvin resist the feather-degrading bacterium Bacillus licheniformis better than white ones. Lorikeets were previously regarded as a third family, Loriidae, [...] but are now considered a tribe (Loriini) within the subfamily Lorinae, family Psittaculidae. The two other tribes in the subfamily are the closely related fig parrots (two genera in the tribe Cyclopsittini) and budgerigar (tribe Melopsittacini).|$|E

5000|$|Psittacopasserae is a taxon {{of birds}} {{consisting}} of the Passeriformes (passerines, {{a large group of}} perching birds) and <b>Psittaciformes</b> (parrots). Per Ericson and colleagues, in analysing genomic DNA, revealed a lineage comprising Passerines, <b>Psittaciformes</b> and Falconiformes. The group was proposed following an alignment of nuclear intron sequences by Shannon Hackett et al. in 2008, it was formally named in a 2011 Nature Communications article by Alexander Suh and other authors working with Jürgen Schmitz's group, based on genetic analysis of the insertion of retroposons into the genomes of key avian lineages over the course of evolution during the Mesozoic Era.|$|E

50|$|The parrot order, <b>Psittaciformes,</b> is {{a tangle}} of genera, many {{containing}} only one species. Parrots include about 353 species of bird—generally grouped into two families: the Cacatuidae or cockatoos, and the Psittacidae or true parrots. The term parrot generally applies both to the entire order and to Psittacidae alone.|$|E
50|$|All {{members of}} the <b>Psittaciformes</b> order have a {{characteristic}} curved beak shape with the upper mandible having slight mobility in the joint with the skull and a generally erect stance. All parrots are zygodactyl—meaning they have four toes on each foot: two that face front and two that face back.|$|E
5000|$|Cacatuidae is one {{of three}} {{families}} of the large and diverse avian order <b>Psittaciformes</b> which consists of 370 species.

50|$|Cariamiformes (or Cariamae) is {{an order}} of {{primarily}} flightless birds that has existed for over 60 million years. The group includes the family Cariamidae (seriemas) and the extinct families Phorusrhacidae, Bathornithidae, Idiornithidae and Ameghinornithidae. Though traditionally considered as a suborder of Gruiformes, both morphological and genetic studies show that they belong to a separate group of birds, Australaves, whose other living members are Falconidae, <b>Psittaciformes</b> and Passeriformes.|$|E
