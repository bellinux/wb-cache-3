40|$|International audienceThe {{solution}} of large eigenproblems {{is involved in}} many scientific and engineering applications when for instance, stability analysis is a concern. For large simulation in material physics or thermo-acoustics, the calculation can last for many hours on large parallel platforms. On future large-scale systems, the {{mean time between failures}} (MTBF) of the system is expected to decrease so that many faults could occur during the {{solution of}} large eigenproblems. Consequently, it becomes critical to design parallel eigensolvers that can survive faults. In that framework, we investigate the relevance of approaches relying on numerical techniques, which might be combined with more classical techniques for real large-scale parallel implementations. Because we focus on numerical remedies we do not consider parallel implementations nor parallel experiments but only numerical experiments. We assume that a separate mechanism ensures the fault detection and that a system layer provides support for setting back the environment (processes,...) in a running state. Once the system is in a running state, after a fault, our main objective is to provide robust resilient schemes so that the eigensolver may keep converging {{in the presence of the}} fault without restarting the calculation from scratch. For this purpose, we extend the interpolation-restart (IR) strategies initially introduced for the solution of linear systems in a previous work to the solution of eigenproblems in this paper. For a given numerical scheme, the IR strategies consist of extracting relevant spectral information from available data after a fault. After data extraction, a well-selected part of the missing data is regenerated through interpolation strategies to constitute a meaningful input to restart the numerical algorithm. One of the main features of this numerical remedy is that it does not require extra resources, i. e., computational unit or computing time, when no fault occurs. In this paper, we revisit a few state-of-the-art methods for solving large sparse eigenvalue problems namely the Arnoldi methods, subspace iteration methods and the Jacobi-Davidson method, in the light of our IR strategies. For each considered eigensolver, we adapt the IR strategies to regenerate as much spectral information as possible. Through extensive numerical experiments, we study the respective robustness of the resulting resilient schemes with respect to the MTBF and to the amount of data loss via qualitative and quantitative illustrations. 1. Introduction. The computation of eigenpairs (eigenvalues and eigenvectors) of large sparse matrices is involved in many scientific and engineering applications such as when stability analysis is a concern. To name a few, it appears in structural dynamics, thermodynamics, thermo-acoustics, quantum chemistry. With the permanent increase of the computational power of high performance computing (HPC) systems by using a larger and larger number of CPU cores or specialized processing units, HPC applications are increasingly prone to faults. To guarantee fault tolerance, two classes of strategies are required. One for the fault detection and the other for fault correction. Faults such as computational node crashes are obvious to detect while silent faults may be challenging to detect. To cope with silent faults, a duplication strategy is commonly used for fault detection [18, 39] by comparing the outputs, while triple modular redundancy (TMR) is used for fault detection and correction [34, 37]. However, the additional computational resources required by such replication strategies may represent a severe penalty. Instead of replicating computational resources, studies [7, 36] propose a time redundancy model for fault detection. It consists in repeating computation twice on the same resource. The advantage of time redundancy models is the flexibility at application level; software developers can indeed select only a set of critical instructions to protect. Recomputing only some instructions instead of the whole application lowers the time redundancy overhead [25]. In some numerical simulations, data naturally satisfy well defined mathematical properties. These properties can be efficiently exploited for fault detection through a <b>periodical</b> <b>check</b> of the numerical properties during computation [10]. Checkpoint/restart is the most studied fault recovery strategy in the context of HPC systems. The common checkpoint/restart scheme consists in periodically saving data onto a reliable storage device such as a remote disk. When a fault occurs, a rollback is performed to the point of the most recent and consistent checkpoint. According to the implemented checkpoint strategy, all processe...|$|E

40|$|The {{applications}} to dynamic sports for an accurate analysis of trajectories represent {{a new perspective}} for carrier phase-based GPS positioning. Introduced in competitive skiing, the GPS technique provides all the qualitative data for a complete analysis of position/velocity/acceleration so that the measured trajectories can be compared throughout the entire track. Consequently, it can help the athletes to find the fastest line and to identify any technical errors. This ensures an enhancement of {{the efficiency of the}} trainings to optimize the performances of the skier, {{as well as that of}} the equipment. This kind of analysis requires decimetric positioning of the skier at a 5 Hz pace or higher. This paper presents a technique that combines modern lightweight GPS-RTK dual frequency receivers with standard GSM mobile phones and trajectory filtering/smoothing procedures. This approach was successfully applied in February 2004 during the FIS-World Cup race in Leysin, Switzerland and in April 2004 during the season’s final race of the professional circuit held in Verbier, Switzerland. Racers and their coaches request the assistance of such a system in future contests. Offering instantaneous position and velocity measurements of high accuracy, satellite techniques such as carrier phase-based positioning can be used to optimize the placement of the timing zone around the point of highest speed (Figure 1).

30|$|In Italy, {{cleaning}} {{operations of}} the Anagrafe are conducted only after every Census, when registrations and (above all) de-registrations ‘d’ufficio’ are possible. Spain additionally introduced in 2005 an ‘expiry procedure’ (caducidad padronal) implemented {{for the first time}} in 2007, that requires all non-EU foreigners without a permanent residence permit to renew their registration in the Padrón every 2 years. After its first implementation, the new population figures for January 1 st, 2007 reflected that approximately a quarter million non-EU foreigners had been deregistered ‘ex officio’ (González-Ferrer, 2009). 6 Secondly, a <b>periodical</b> residence <b>check</b> (comprobación periódica de la residencia) to be conducted every 5  years was introduced for EU citizens and permanent non-EU residents in 2011. This procedure was implemented {{for the first time in}} 2013 : more than 400, 000 foreigners disappeared from the Padrón, 87 % of which were EU citizens (mainly from Germany, UK and France) (Ródenas, 2012).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{rare case}} of {{coexistence}} of occupational airborne dermatitis with rosacea {{is presented in}} a 41 -year-old female farmer. Her first dermatitis symptoms appeared {{at the age of}} 10 when she started helping her parents on the farm. Uncovered skin areas of the face, neck, décolleté, forearms and the hands gradually became involved. The dermatitis symptoms were provoked by agricultural dusts (especially of flax and dried herbs). For the subsequent 30 years, the work-related disease remained undiagnosed {{due to the lack of}} pre-employment and <b>periodical</b> health <b>check</b> in agriculture. She also suffered from protein contact dermatitis of the hands from cow epithelium. About 20 years after the onset of airborne dermatitis, rosacea developed, possibly secondary to the prolonged treatment. Diagnostic tests carried out at our department confirmed hypersensitivity to occupational allergens: type I allergy to storage mites, moulds, and cow epithelium. A cutaneous late-phase reaction on prick tests and serum precipitins to the bacterium Pantoea agglomerans (Erwinia herbicola) also were found. Among non-occupational hypersensitivities, type I allergy to house dust mites and contact allergy to methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone (Kathon CG) was found. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} the thesis was verifying the effects of fish {{breeding}} in production-oriented fish farming on the ecosystem of fish ponds. The observation was conducted in R 1 and R 3 Boheľov fish ponds in 2014 and 2016 seasons. The RKK and SGR parameters, the natural fish pond production and the overall production were monitored. The monitored chemical and physical parameters included the developments of the essential parameters at two-week intervals; oxygen, pH, transparency, temperature and insoluble substances. Chlorophyll-a, total phosphorus and total nitrogen were monitored to assess the timely trophy in the ponds. To assess the effects on water organism community zooplankton succession by Cladocera, Copepoda and Rotifera taxonomic orders was monitored at two-week intervals. The monitoring also included <b>periodical</b> <b>checking</b> of the biomass of undesired fish that reached the value of 44, 5 kg. ha- 1 in the R 3 pond. Roach (Rutilus rutilus) was the dominating specie. Control fishing was carried out during the seasons to estimate the actual biomass of carp stock. The total production ranged between 922, 1 - 1181, 5 kg. ha- 1. The RKK level was 2, 73 - 3, 26. The SGR value of 0, 902 %. day- 1 was reached in stock C 1 - 2. High carp stock influenced the zooplankton communities. During the observation no occurrence of the intermediate zooplankton was found. The prevailing species of the Cladocera order included Bosmina longirostris, Dafnia galeata and D. parvula. In the Cladocera order there was prevalence of Acanthocyclops trajani and in rotifera order there was prevalence of Brachionus calycifloris, Asplanchna priodonta, Polyartha sp. Spearman's correlation confirmed difference between the total zooplankton in R 1 pond compared with R 3 pond in both seasons (R 3 2014 : rho= 0, 066; pval= 0, 854; R 3 2016 rho=- 0, 018; pval= 0, 96). The TSI index showed hypertrophic condition in both ponds. The average values of the index were 78, 3 (6, 2) in R 1 and 75, 6 (? 3, 8) in R 3. The lowest average oxygen values, namely 3, 2 mg. l- 1 (2, 0), were in pond R 3 in 2016. Taking account of the adverse development of the essential parameters (oxygen and clarity deficits) {{and the status of}} the trophy certain limitation of the farming intensity was proposed, namely: reducing the carp stock down to 1 / 3 including a calculation of the production-related financial loss. Reducing the stock is the only way how to make the fish ponds sustainable. Relevant compensation, in line with the effective European regulations, needs to be addressed {{hand in hand with the}} proposed measures...|$|R
5000|$|The early systems, {{along with}} the simple paper tickets used on the rail network, made {{policing}} fare compliance somewhat labour-intensive. Originally the railways had ticket collectors or inspectors at the exit of every station. Bus services had drivers, and previously conductors, selling or <b>checking</b> <b>periodical</b> tickets. The cost-saving reduction of ticketing staff on state public transport resulted in the responsibility for fare compliance being transferred from the service operators onto the passengers. This change sometimes resulted in revenue loss. For example, Urban Transit's MetroTen was easily and frequently defrauded by passengers. Of the [...] "el cheapo Metroten ticketing system that the former Labor Government installed", transport minister Bruce Baird told Parliament, [...] "Many people know that rorting has gone on. ...
