The effect of these amendments was to place additional obligations on manufacturers of generic (unpatented) pharmaceuticals. Some additional provisions were also included in an attempt to safeguard against potentially ‘illegitimate’ patent infringement action taken by patentees against such manufacturers. This article examines these provisions and their likely effect on the patent protection strategies adopted by the pharmaceutical industry.

These trends have resulted in persistent concerns over the quality of issued patents. Responding to recent writings questioning the value of maintaining high levels of patent quality, Professor Jay Thomas asserts both that patent quality matters, and that increasing the responsibilities of patent applicants provides a fair and efficient mechanism for improving patent office work product.

40|$|This Article {{examines}} the emerging {{elements of a}} new model for patent governance. It is divided into four parts. In Section One, we develop a model of dynamic patent governance. This model extends the theoretical framework of network governance, to explain the emergence of networks in the decisionmaking infrastructure for {{the public and private}} actors in the patent system. Dynamic patent governance widens this theoretical framework in two key ways. First, dynamic patent governance, within its formal dimensions, is {{based on the idea that}} heterogeneous administrative actors regulate the grant and enforcement of patents. This challenges a perspective that sees patent examination agencies as the sole actor of importance within the patent system. Second, dynamic patent governance, within its informal dimensions, highlights that the patent administrative regime is shaped by the fluid relationship of diverse actors to these heterogeneous administrative actors. Section Two explores the consequences of a more dynamic patent governance context. Section Three applies this model to explore the recent Myriad litigation in the United States and Europe. Section Four focuses on some particular challenges that dynamic patent governance poses to: (1) the impulse to centralize <b>patent</b> <b>administration</b> and litigation; and (2) the efficiency of the patent system. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The patent {{department}} of Westinghouse Electric Company was organised in 1888. When George Westinghouse invented and industrialized air brakes {{he applied for}} patents in his own name. Those patents were administered mainly by patent attorneys in Pittsburgh. After {{the formation of the}} Electric Company, in 1886, organisation of patent management progressed. For a while, the patents invented by engineers were assigned to George Westinghouse personally; however, almost all of the electrical patents were assigned to the company in 1888. Thus, the idea of corporate intellectual property was adopted. At the same time the patent department was formed in Pittsburgh. It was directed by Charles A. Terry, a patent attorney, who began administering patent applications internally. The internalisation of patent management was necessitated by {{the increase in the number}} of engineers and in their output. To support <b>patent</b> <b>administration</b> it was desirable for the company to conduct patent work by using in-house patent attorneys rather than external law firms. However, external attorneys continued to play decisive roles in acquisition, licensing and enforcement. On the other hand, the corporate intellectual property system within the Electric Company was somewhat limited by the paternalistic management style of George Westinghouse. Whereas the patent department was established in 1888, there was not a definite rule covering employee inventions until around 1910...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} patents {{have argued that}} the very {{materiality}} and techniques of legal media, such as the written patent document, are vital for the legal construction of a patentable invention. Developing the centrality placed on patent documents further, it becomes important to understand how these documents are ordered and mobilized. Patent classification answers the necessity of making the virtual nature of textual claims practicable by linking written inscription to bureaucracy. Here, the epistemological organization of documents overlaps with the grid of <b>patent</b> <b>administration.</b> How are scientific inventions represented in such a process? If we examine the process of creating a new patent category within the International Patent Classification (IPC), it becomes clear that disagreements about the substance of the novel inventive subject matter have been resolved by computer simulations of patent documents in draft classifications. The practical needs of patent examiners were the most important concerns in the making of a new category. Such a lack of epistemological mediation between the scientific and legal identities of an invention depicts a legal understanding that science is already inside patent law. From an internal legal perspective, the self-referential introduction of the new patent category may make practical sense; however it becomes problematic from a technological and scientific standpoint as the remit of the patent classification also affects other social contexts and practice...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{greatest}} problems facing the current <b>patent</b> <b>administration</b> is a long patent pendency period. This study focuses on Request for Continued Examination (RCE) practice, {{and its effects on}} the current patent application backlog problem. RCEs are used to continue prosecution after a patent examiner has issued a final rejection. However, now that RCEs are placed on an examiner’s special docket, some examiners may pick up prosecution one to two years after the last action. Accordingly, there are great inefficiencies that may be created by this delay, such as relearning issues and questions from the previous action, diminished value of examiner interviews, and a higher likelihood of transfer to a new examiner. This study suggests that the RCE problem may be much worse for some art units compared to others. Specifically, the RCE problem is unevenly distributed between certain art units with technology center 1600 (biotechnology and organic chemistry) suffering the most from unexamined RCEs, while technology center 2800 (semiconductors, electrical and optical systems and components) remain unaffected. This RCE backlog can result in a delay of approximately three years for some art units. Possible solutions to the RCE problem include creating a two-track examiner specialization program: one track focusing on drafting office actions and a second track focusing on finding relevant prior art. Another possible solution would be to create a new type of request to reopen prosecution after final to allow applicants to enter new narrowing amendments or add new declarations without adding new arguments. A final solution may be to place the RCE back in the examiner’s normal docket and not in the examiner’s special new docket...|$|E

40|$|Whereas Congress has {{increasingly}} turned to administrative agencies to regulate complex technical areas, the patent system has remarkably remained an outlier. In the patent arena, the judiciary— not a federal agency—is {{perceived to be}} the most important expositor of substantive patent law standards. Yet, as the criticism toward the patent system has grown, so too have the challenges to this unusual power dynamic. The calls for institutional reform culminated in late 2011 with the enactment of the historic Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA). Although scholars have recognized that the AIA bestows a glut of new powers upon the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), this Article contends that commentators have failed to recognize the extent to which the AIA alters the fundamental power dynamic between the judiciary and the PTO. By anointing the PTO as the primary interpreter of the core patentability standards, this Article posits that the AIA rejects over two hundred years of court dominance in patent policy. Although the patent system has traditionally suffered from a lack of serious engagement with administrative law, applying administrative law principles to the AIA has tremendous implications for the roles of patent institutions and, as this Article argues, results in a normatively desirable outcome. The AIA, by making the PTO the primary expositor of the core provisions of the Patent Act, ushers the patent system into the modern administrative era—which has long recognized the deficiencies associated with judge-driven policy. Moreover, the incorporation of administrative law principles into the patent system has substantial implications for administrative law itself. As this Article attempts to reconcile the distinctive features of <b>patent</b> <b>administration</b> with existing administrative law jurisprudence, it provides insight into a prolonged circuit split on the proper approach to determining the triggering provisions for formal adjudication, as well as when a grant of formal adjudicatory authority carries with it the ability to speak with the force of law...|$|E
40|$|It's not {{the size}} of the dog in the fight, it's {{the size of}} the fight in the dog. And I'm only a little person, but I fight. " [...] Yvonne D’Arcy Introduction In 2015, the High Court of Australia handed down a {{landmark}} ruling in respect of Myriad Genetics Inc. and its patents in respect of genetic testing for breast cancer and ovarian cancer. This brought to a conclusion a long-running legal and political controversy over gene patents in Australia. The dispute – a ‘dog-fight’ according to its protagonist, Yvonne D’Arcy - has a long genesis. In June 2010, Cancer Voices Australia and Yvonne D’Arcy launched an action in the Federal Court of Australia against the validity of a BRCA 1 patent – held by Myriad Genetics Inc., the Centre de Recherche du Chul, the Cancer Institute of Japan and Genetic Technologies Limited. Yvonne D’Arcy – a Brisbane woman who has had treatment for breast cancer – maintained: ‘I believe that what they are doing is morally and ethically corrupt and that big companies should not control any parts of the human body. ’ She observed: ‘For my daughter, I've her have mammograms, etc, because of me but I would still like her {{to be able to have}} the test to see if the mutation gene is in there from me. ’ The applicants argued: ‘The isolation of the BRCA 1 gene mutation from the human body constitutes no more than a medical or scientific discovery of a naturally occurring phenomenon and does not give rise to a patentable invention’. The applicants also argued that ‘the alleged invention is not a patentable invention in that, so far as claimed in claims 1 – 3, it is not a manner of manufacture within the meaning of s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies 1624 ’. The applicants argued that ‘the alleged invention is a mere discovery’. Moreover, the applicants contended that ‘the alleged invention of each of claims 1 – 3 is not a patentable invention because they are claims for biological processes for the generation of human beings’. The applicants, though, later dropped the argument that the patent claims related to biological processes for the generation of human beings. In February 2013, Nicholas J of the Federal Court of Australia considered the case brought by Cancer Voices Australia and Yvonne D’Arcy against Myriad Genetics. The judge presented the issues in the case, as follows: The issue that arises in this case is of considerable importance. It relates to the patentability of genes, or gene sequences, and the practice of ‘gene patenting’. Briefly stated, the issue to be decided is whether under the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) (the Act), a valid patent may be granted for a claim that covers naturally occurring nucleic acid – either deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) – that has been “isolated”. In this context, the word “isolated” implies that naturally occurring nucleic acid found in the cells of the human body, whether it be DNA or RNA, has been removed from the cellular environment in which it naturally exists and separated from other cellular components also found there. The genes found in the human body are made of nucleic acid. The particular gene with which the patent in suit is concerned (BRCA 1) is a human breast and ovarian cancer disposing gene. Various mutations that may be present in this gene have been linked to various forms of cancer including breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The judge held that Myriad Genetics’ patent claims were a ‘manner of manufacture’ under s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies and s 18 (1) (a) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth). The matter was appealed to the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia. In September 2014, five judges of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia dismissed the appeal by Yvonne D’Arcy in favour of Myriad Genetics Inc. The joint judgment by Allsop CJ, Dowsett, Kenny, Bennett, and Middleton JJ provided several justifications for their position. First, the judges held ‘the boundaries of the conception of patentability are not dictated only by deductive logic from the linguistic premises formulated in the scientific knowledge of a particular age; rather, the boundaries must be such as to be apt to encompass the development of science and technology, and human ingenuity’. The judges emphasized: ‘This explains the broadening concept of patentability since the first quarter of the 17 th century. ’ Second, the judges maintained that ‘human intervention that creates an artificial state of affairs that has some discernible effect is essential. ’ Third, the judges commented that ‘whilst notions of utility, ingenuity and invention have their place after one concludes that the claim is within the field of s 6, such notions also inform the context of analysis of patentability by assisting in describing the claims to processes or products that are claimed new results of principles carried into practice through human intervention and that create some claimed useful result by involving an artificial state of affairs’. Fourth, judges insisted that ‘expressions such as “the work of nature” or “the laws of nature” are not found in the statute; nor are they useful tools of analysis’. Fifth, the judges held that ‘the distinction between discovery of a scientific principle or fact and a deployment of such to a useful end by a procedure is real. ’ The Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia concluded: ‘The isolated nucleic acid, including cDNA, has resulted in an artificially created state of affairs for economic benefit’. The judges insisted: ‘The claimed product is properly the subject of letters patent. ’ The Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia observed: ‘The claim is to an invention within the meaning of s 18 (1) of the Act’. The decision generated public discussion and debate. Yvonne D’Arcy appealed to the High Court of Australia. Myriad Genetics Inc. sought to defend the decisions of the Federal Court of Australia and the Full Federal Court of Australia. The Institute of Patent and Trademark Attorneys of Australia sought to intervene in the matter as an amicus curiae. The Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, George Brandis, also sought to intervene in the matter. In contrast to the Supreme Court of the United States, the High Court of Australia was reluctant to accept a wide range of submissions about the policy implications in respect of gene patents. The High Court of Australia heard oral argument over the matter in June 2015. There were epic, high-quality battles between leading intellectual property barristers, David Catterns QC and David Shavin QC. There was significant media coverage of the case – including by the flagship current affairs programme, the 7 : 30 Report. The matter was well-attended in the High Court of Australia in Canberra. I was an eyewitness to the oral argument, along with Professor Ann Monotti from Monash Law School. In October 2015, the High Court of Australia handed down a landmark decision in respect of gene patents held by the Utah biotechnology firm, Myriad Genetics Inc. The ruling was an unanimous decision – supported by French CJ, Kiefel, Bell, Gageler, Keane, Nettle and Gordon JJ. The High Court of Australia’s Registry sought to summarise the decision thus: ‘The High Court held that an isolated nucleic acid, coding for a BRCA 1 protein, with specific variations from the norm that are indicative of susceptibility to breast cancer and ovarian cancer, was not a "patentable invention" within the meaning of s 18 (1) (of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth). ’ The ruling attracted significant media attention. Drawing upon the framework of human rights, this chapter provides a systematic analysis of the debate over gene patents in Australia. In particular, this chapter focuses upon the landmark decision by the High Court of Australia in D’Arcy v. Myriad Genetics Inc. in respect of gene patents. This Chapter focuses upon three key themes. First, it explores the debate between Australian jurists over the history of patent law, the meaning of such key terms as a ‘manner of manufacture’, ‘products of nature’, and ‘an artificial state of affairs. ’ Such a discussion has taken place against the backdrop of a long history of intellectual property and biotechnology. Second, this Chapter examines the discussion over the respective roles of the <b>patent</b> <b>administration,</b> the judiciary and the Australian Parliament in resolving disputes in respect of gene patents. It critically analyses the aftermath of the High Court of Australia decision – with the debate over IP Australia’s proposed examination guidelines. Third, this piece investigates how the High Court of Australia considered the international context of the debate over gene patents – and the comparative approaches to the topic. The conclusion foreshadows future developments – such as the push for higher standards of intellectual property protection under the Trans-Pacific Partnership...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{threat of}} non-communicable {{diseases}} ("NCDs") is increasingly becoming a global health crisis and are pervasive in high, middle, and low-income populations {{resulting in an}} estimated 36 million deaths per year. There {{is a need to}} assess intellectual property rights ("IPRs") that may impede generic production and availability and affordability to essential NCD medicines. METHODS: Using the data sources listed below, the study design systematically eliminated NCD drugs that had no patent/exclusivity provisions on API, dosage, or administration route. The first step identified essential medicines that treat certain high disease burden NCDs. A second step examined the patent and exclusivity status of active ingredient, dosage and listed route of administration using exclusion criteria outlined in this study. MATERIALS: We examined the patent and exclusivity status of medicines listed in the World Health Organization's ("WHO") Model List of Essential Drugs (Medicines) ("MLEM") and other WHO sources for drugs treating certain NCDs. i. e., cardiovascular and respiratory disease, cancers, and diabetes. We utilized the USA Food and Drug Administration Orange Book and the USA Patent and Trademark Office databases as references given the predominant number of medicines registered in the USA. RESULTS: Of the 359 MLEM medicines identified, 22 % (79 / 359) address targeted NCDs. Of these 79, only eight required in-depth patent or exclusivity assessment. Upon further review, no NCD MLEM medicines had study patent or exclusivity protection for reviewed criteria. CONCLUSIONS: We find that ensuring availability and affordability of potential generic formulations of NCD MLEM medicines appears to be more complex than the presence of IPRs with API, dosage, or <b>administration</b> <b>patent</b> or exclusivity protection. Hence, more sophisticated analysis of NCD barriers to generic availability and affordability should be conducted in order to ensure equitable access to global populations for these essential medicines...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{economic}} {{literature on}} Intellectual Property and more especially on patents has been expanded since several decades, as {{consequence of the}} vertiginous growth {{of the number of}} patents all over the world (See for instance, Boldrin et Levine, 2013). If patents illustrate an ancient innovation incentive mecanism, other institutional arrangements have coexisted with IP throughout the centuries. Several historical works put in light the role of procurement contracts and innovation contests in the emergence of major innovations, especially in the 19 century (David 1993). An innovation contest or a prize can be defined as "challenge by one party (a seeker) to a third party or parties (a solver) to identify a solution to a particular problem or reward contestants for accomplishing a particular goal" (Challenge. Gov). The winner of this competition receives a prize which may be monetary or non monetary. Since the 90 s, one can observe a growth of innovation contests, especially in the US, through the sponsorship of private but also public organizations such as federal agencies. The aim {{of this article is to}} highlight and analyze the origin of this renewed interest of the US federal state for the prize. Firstly, if the standard economic scholars consider a contest as an alternative tool to a patent, this approach cannot explain in a satisfactory way the involvement of the US federal agencies in the prizes. Relying on an institutional approach, and especially Innovation System's approach, we show that prizes are not comparable to patents, because they vary in nature, and display both common and different properties vis à vis patents. In order to identify the properties of prizes, we rely on US grand challenges that have been studied in the literature and on the various reports and documents published by the administration of president Obama. Secondly, we explain that the nature and properties of prizes, allow federal agencies to launch prizes that combine technological, environment and society challenges, in order to guide innovations toward the majors goals identifies by the public authorities for the future. This article contributes to the economic literature on patents, in illustrating the fact that prizes and patents could not be strictly considered as alternatives, because of their different nature, but rather complementary in given circumstances. In this view, we made the choice to use an institutional framework in order to focus on the characteristics of contests. By using the functional approach of innovation system we aim to give an explanation of this phenomenon. We stand that prize system is a specific institutional tool which few properties and characteristics are different from <b>patents.</b> Public <b>administration</b> use prize in order to stimulate / induce innovation in special case. In this view we propose a complementary approach of patent and prize with a possible articulation...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Labetalol {{is often}} used in severe preeclampsia (PE). Hypotension, {{bradycardia}} and hypoglycemia are feared neonatal side effects, but may also occur in (preterm) infants regardless of labetalol exposure. We analyzed the possible association between intrauterine labetalol exposure and such side effects. Study design: From 1 January 2003 through 31 March 2008, all infants from mothers suffering severe PE admitted to one tertiary care center were included. Severe PE was defined according to the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP) criteria. Infants exposed to labetalol in utero (labetalol infants) were compared with infants, who were not exposed to labetalol (controls). Neonatal records were reviewed for hypotension (RR Results: Of 109 infants, 55 {{had been exposed to}} labetalol, whereas 54 were not (controls). Gestational age at delivery and birthweight were similar in both groups (31. 8 vs. 32. 8 weeks (p = 0. 06) and 1510 vs. 1639 grams (p= 0. 25), respectively for the labetalol vs. control group). Hypotension occurred significantly more in conjunction with labetalol exposure (16, (29. 1 %) vs. 4 (7. 4 %); p = 0. 003). irrespective of the route of <b>administration.</b> <b>Patent</b> ductus arteriosus (PDA) was present in 9 (56 %) of hypotensive labetalol infants compared to 1 (24 %) infant in the hypotensive control group (NS). In a multivariate regression model, labetalol exposure, the need for intubation and PDA appeared independently associated with hypotension (P Conclusion: Hypotension is more common after maternal labetalol exposure, regardless of the dosage and route of administration. The need for intubation and the presence of a PDA also play a role. Hypoglycemia is a very common finding in this population and is merely related to prematurity and independent of labetalol exposure as was the incidental occurrence of bradycardia. These findings on the neonatal side effects of maternal labetalol treatment in preeclampsia underline the importance of frequent blood glucose and blood pressure measurements in the first days of life, especially in intubated preterm infants with a PDA.
