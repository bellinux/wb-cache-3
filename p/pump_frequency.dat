40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{analysis of a}} spin pump {{in the presence of}} a superconducting lead. The spin pump is facilitated by a rotating magnetic field which provides a spin flip mechanism and hence can generate a spin current without an accompanying charge current. Using a nonequilibrium Green's function method, we obtain a general solution of the pumped charge current and spin current in both the adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes. The numerical results for the charge current and spin current are presented as we vary different system parameters such as the gate voltage, the external magnetic field, and the <b>pumping</b> <b>frequency.</b> We find that for a quantum dot with a single resonant level in line with the Fermi energy of the left normal lead, a pure spin current is generated by a rotating magnetic field at any frequency.

50|$|Quasi-phase-matching is a {{technique}} in nonlinear optics which allows a positive net flow of energy from the <b>pump</b> <b>frequency</b> to the signal and idler frequencies by creating a periodic structure in the nonlinear medium. Momentum is conserved, as is necessary for phase-matching, through an additional momentum contribution corresponding to the wavevector of the periodic structure. Consequently, in principle any three-wave mixing process that satisfies energy conservation can be phase-matched. For example, all the optical frequencies involved can be collinear, can have the same polarization, and travel through the medium in arbitrary directions. This allows one to use the largest nonlinear coefficient of the material in the nonlinear interaction.|$|E

Energy will always flow from pump to signal {{as long as the}} phase between the two optical waves is less than 180 degrees. Beyond 180 degrees, energy flows back from the signal to the pump frequencies. The coherence length is the length of the medium in which the phase of pump and the sum of idler and signal frequencies are 180 degrees from each other. At each coherence length the crystal axes are flipped which allows the energy to continue to positively flow from the pump to the signal and idler frequencies.|$|E
50|$|Kerr {{frequency}} combs (also known as microresonator {{frequency combs}}) are optical frequency combs which are generated from a continuous wave pump laser by the Kerr nonlinearity. This coherent {{conversion of the}} pump laser to a frequency comb takes place inside an optical resonator which is typically of micrometer to millimeter in size and is therefore termed a microresonator. The coherent generation of the frequency comb from a continuous wave laser with the optical nonlinearity as a gain sets Kerr frequency combs apart from today’s most common optical frequency combs. These frequency combs are generated by mode-locked lasers where the dominating gain stems from a conventional laser gain medium, which is pumped incoherently. Because Kerr frequency combs only rely on the nonlinear properties of the medium inside the microresonator and do not require a broadband laser gain medium, broad Kerr frequency combs can in principle be generated around any <b>pump</b> <b>frequency.</b>|$|E
