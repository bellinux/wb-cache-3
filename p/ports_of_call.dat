5|$|The Chinese of the Song dynasty were adept sailors who {{traveled}} to <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> {{as far away}} as Fatimid Egypt. They were well equipped for their journeys abroad, in large seagoing vessels steered by stern-post rudders and guided by the directional compass. Even before Shen Kuo and Zhu Yu had described the mariner's magnetic needle compass, the earlier military treatise of the Wujing Zongyao in 1044 had also described a thermoremanence compass. This was a simple iron or steel needle that was heated, cooled, and placed in a bowl of water, producing the effect of weak magnetization, although its use was described only for navigation on land and not at sea.|$|E

She left the last port on 11 August and arrived back in Annapolis on 2 September. After disembarking the midshipmen there, she went to Philadelphia, where she remained for seven months. South Carolina returned to sea in early April 1921 for training off Culebra Island, followed by exercises in Chesapeake Bay. Another training cruise for midshipmen began on 29 May, this time to Europe. <b>Ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> included Christiana, Norway, and Lisbon, Portugal.

25|$|The Action of 7 February 1813 was a naval {{battle between}} two evenly matched frigates from the French Navy and the British Royal Navy, Aréthuse and HMS Amelia. The battle was fought {{during the night}} of 7 February 1813 at the Îles de Los, off Guinea. It lasted four hours, causing {{significant}} damage and casualties to both opponents, and resulted in a stalemate.

25|$|The {{first major}} long {{distance}} expedition that experienced virtually no scurvy {{was that of}} the Spanish naval officer Alessandro Malaspina, 1789–1794. Malaspina's medical officer, Pedro González, was convinced that fresh oranges and lemons were essential for preventing scurvy. Only one outbreak occurred, during a 56-day trip across the open sea. Five sailors came down with symptoms, one seriously. After three days at Guam all five were healthy again. Spain's large empire and many <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> made it easier to acquire fresh fruit.|$|E

25|$|Tourism is an {{important}} income source for the city. The hotels in the city may be full at times, due to {{the increasing number of}} tourists and conferences. Prior to the Rolling Stones concert in September 2006, many hotels were already fully booked several months in advance. Bergen is recognised as the unofficial capital of the region known as Western Norway, and recognised and marketed as the gateway city to the world-famous fjords of Norway and for that reason it has become Norway's largest – and one of Europe's largest – cruise ship <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E

25|$|Bowes, as he {{was known}} in the colony, kept a journal from 22 March 1787 to 12 August 1789.

His journal is notable for its interest in natural history including descriptions of bird life at Port Jackson and Lord Howe Island on the Lady Penrhyns return voyage. The journal contains 25 drawings in watercolour, pen and ink, including the earliest known surviving illustration of the emu by a European. These elements provide a unique account different from the other First Fleet Journals.|$|E
