40|$|New {{techniques}} {{being employed}} by Orion guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C) using a reaction control system (RCS) under parachutes are described. <b>Pendulosity</b> {{refers to a}} pendulum-oscillatory mode that can occur during descent under main parachutes {{and that has been}} observed during Orion parachute drop tests. The pendulum mode reduces the ability of GN&C to maneuver the suspended vehicle resulting in undesirable increases to structural loads at touch-down. Parachute redesign efforts have been unsuccessful in reducing the pendulous behavior necessitating GN&C mitigation options. An observer has been developed to estimate the pendulum motion as well as the underlying wind velocity vector. Using this knowledge the control system maneuvers the vehicle using two separate strategies determined by a wind velocity magnitude threshold; at high wind velocities the vehicle is aligned with the wind direction and for cases with lower wind velocities the vehicle is aligned such that it is perpendicular to the swing plane. Pendulum damping techniques using RCS thrusters are discussed but have not been selected for use onboard the Orion spacecraft. The techniques discussed in this paper will be flown on Exploration Mission 1 (EM- 1) ...|$|E
