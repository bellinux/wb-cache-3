50|$|Hoffmann was {{a pioneer}} of botanical {{phenology}} (<b>plant</b> <b>climatology).</b> He also did important studies {{in the fields of}} plant physiology and phytogeography. He conducted research involving the biological aspects of fungi in relation to fermentation, putrefaction and disease, and also performed early investigations in the field of bacteriology.|$|E
50|$|He {{made major}} {{contributions}} to the knowledge of Prussian flora, conducting research {{in the fields of}} phytogeography, <b>plant</b> systematics and <b>climatology</b> as it pertained to botany.|$|R

To cope with these problems, fruit growers mustbe competent in financing, banking, buying, public relations, marketing, meteorology, <b>climatology,</b> <b>plant</b> science, soil science, entomology, pathology, irrigation, fertilization, chemistry, physics, mechanics, and management...|$|R
50|$|In 1806, Buch {{proceeded}} to Scandinavia and {{spent two years}} in examining its physical constitution. This furnished the materials for his work entitled Reise durch Norwegen und Lappland ("Travels in Norway and Lapland", Berlin, 1810). He made many important observations on the geography of <b>plants,</b> on <b>climatology</b> and on geology. He showed that many of the erratic blocks on the North German plains must have come from Scandinavia. He also established the fact that the whole of Sweden is slowly but continuously rising above the level of the sea from Frederikshald to Abo.|$|R
40|$|Seed {{procyanidin}} {{composition of}} Vitis vinifera L. var. ˈCarignanˈ and ˈGrenacheˈ was analyzed {{to assess the}} impact of vintage <b>climatology,</b> <b>plant</b> vigor and bunch variability on the quality of grapes. This study was carried out over 2007 and 2008 vintages in Terra Alta denomination of origin (DO). This region is located in northeastern Spain and characterized by a Mediterranean climate with a continental tendency. Procyanidin composition of seeds from four vineyards was analyzed by rapid resolution liquid chromatography (RRLC-DAD-TOF/MS). Vintage, vigor and ripeness uniformity had an influence on the procyanidin concentration in seeds. Flavan- 3 -ol polymerization increased during the warm year, together with a notable dependence on the variety and vine vigor. In warmer years and low vigor, ˈGrenacheˈ seed composition is likely to be more vulnerable than ˈCarignanˈ. High levels of flavan- 3 -ol monomers and low polymerization characterized the seeds of the temperate year. </p...|$|R
