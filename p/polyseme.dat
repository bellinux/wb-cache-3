50|$|A {{conventional}} military taxonomy {{might be}} an hierarchical set of classifications for a given set of objects; and the progress of reasoning is developed from the general to the more specific. In such taxonomic schema, a conflative term is always a <b>polyseme.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Israel {{is defined}} in several of its laws as a [...] "Jewish and {{democratic}} state" [...] (medina yehudit ve-demokratit). However, the term [...] "Jewish" [...] is a <b>polyseme</b> that can describe the Jewish people as either an ethnic or a religious group. The debate {{about the meaning of}} the term [...] "Jewish" [...] and its legal and social applications {{is one of the most}} profound issues with which Israeli society deals. The problem of the status of religion in Israel, even though it is relevant to all religions, usually refers to the status of Judaism in Israeli society. Thus, even though from a constitutional point of view Judaism is not the state religion in Israel, its status nevertheless determines relations between religion and state and the extent to which religion influences the political center.|$|E
5000|$|The {{difference}} between homonyms and <b>polysemes</b> is subtle. Lexicographers define <b>polysemes</b> {{within a single}} dictionary lemma, numbering different meanings, while homonyms are treated in separate lemmata. Semantic shift can separate a polysemous word into separate homonyms. For example, check as in [...] "bank check" [...] (or Cheque), check in chess, and check meaning [...] "verification" [...] are considered homonyms, while they originated as a single word derived from chess in the 14th century. Psycholinguistic experiments have shown that homonyms and <b>polysemes</b> are represented differently within people's mental lexicon: while the different meanings of homonyms (which are semantically unrelated) tend to interfere or {{compete with each other}} during comprehension, this does not usually occur for the <b>polysemes</b> that have semantically related meanings. Results for this contention, however, have been mixed.|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{linguistic}} {{accounts of}} lexical ambiguity distinguish between homonymy, where words that share a lexical form have unrelated meanings, and polysemy, where the meanings are related. The present study explored the psychological reality of this theoretical assumption by asking {{whether there is}} evidence that homonyms and <b>polysemes</b> are represented and processed differently in the brain. We investigated the time-course of meaning activation of different types of ambiguous words using EEG. Homonyms and <b>polysemes</b> were each further subdivided into two: unbalanced homonyms (e. g., ". coach") and balanced homonyms (e. g., ". match"); metaphorical <b>polysemes</b> (e. g., ". mouth") and metonymic <b>polysemes</b> (e. g., ". rabbit"). These four types of ambiguous words were presented as primes in a visual single-word priming delayed lexical decision task employing a long ISI (750. ms). Targets were related to one of the meanings of the primes, or were unrelated. ERPs formed relative to the target onset indicated that the theoretical distinction between homonymy and polysemy was reflected in the N 400 brain response. For targets following homonymous primes (both unbalanced and balanced), no effects survived at this long ISI indicating that both meanings of the prime had already decayed. On the other hand, for polysemous primes (both metaphorical and metonymic), activation was observed for both dominant and subordinate senses. The observed processing differences between homonymy and polysemy provide evidence in support of differential neuro-cognitive representations for the two types of ambiguity. We argue that the polysemous senses act collaboratively to strengthen the representation, facilitating maintenance, while the competitive nature of homonymous meanings leads to decay...|$|R
50|$|Legal Information Retrieval {{attempts}} {{to increase the}} effectiveness of legal searches by {{increasing the number of}} relevant documents (providing a high recall rate) and reducing the number of irrelevant documents (a high precision rate). This is a difficult task, as the legal field is prone to jargon, <b>polysemes</b> (words that have different meanings when used in a legal context), and constant change.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>polyseme</b> {{is a word}} {{or phrase}} with different, but related senses. Since the test for {{polysemy}} is the vague concept of relatedness, judgments of polysemy {{can be difficult to}} make. Because applying pre-existing words to new situations is a natural process of language change, looking at words' etymology is helpful in determining polysemy but not the only solution; as words become lost in etymology, what once was a useful distinction of meaning may no longer be so. Some apparently unrelated words share a common historical origin, however, so etymology is not an infallible test for polysemy, and dictionary writers also often defer to speakers' intuitions to judge polysemy in cases where it contradicts etymology. English has many polysemous words. For example, the verb [...] "to get" [...] can mean [...] "procure" [...] (I'll get the drinks), [...] "become" [...] (she got scared), [...] "understand" [...] (I get it) etc.|$|E
40|$|How the {{language}} processor uses linguistic information to interpret {{words in a}} sentence is not fully understood (Federmeier, 2007). This self-paced reading experiment investigated whether {{the language}} processor uses contextual information {{at the point of}} lexical access to immediately commit to one sense of a <b>polyseme,</b> or whether context is used later in disambiguation. Participants read context-setting sentences which either biased for the figurative sense interpretation of a <b>polyseme</b> or did not bias towards any specific sense interpretation, followed by sentences containing the <b>polyseme</b> which required the language processor to select the polyseme’s figurative or literal sense. While a facilitatory effect of context was observed, participants encountered greater difficulty when accessing the figurative sense of the <b>polyseme</b> as compared to the literal sense, irrespective of whether the context biased towards the figurative sense interpretation of the <b>polyseme</b> or not. These results constitute evidence that the language processor uses structural information in <b>polyseme</b> disambiguation, and that contextual information has a late effect on sense selection in comparison to structural information...|$|E
40|$|Although {{ambiguity}} in languages is often {{considered as a}} problem, it provides value. Ambiguity is found {{in every aspect of}} language, but newspaper headlines are outstanding as the most important source of examples of ambiguity. One of the most important reasons that newspaper readers cannot be successful readers while glancing at newspaper headlines is that they are not aware of different types of ambiguities created by special characteristics which are typical of newspaper language. Ambiguity is not only typical of headlines, but in this research I deal with structural (noun-verb) and lexical (<b>polyseme)</b> {{ambiguity in}} English headlines written by native and non-native journalists. The hypothesis is that the texts, in the case of this study, the headlines written by native and non-native journalists contain different amounts of structural (noun/verb) and lexical (<b>polyseme)</b> ambiguity. In order to arrive at the exact amounts of the two above mentioned ambiguities, we made fifty tests of ''Noun or Verb?' ' tests and fifty tests of ''what does it mean?' ' tests based on the headlines in the two English newspapers written by non-native and foreign journalists. The participants were selected from the university undergraduate English students and described and compared the two sets of data in terms of structural and lexical ambiguities to find out which set of English newspaper headlines (written by native or non- native journalists) are more ambiguous. Finally we found out that headlines written by native journalists are more ambiguous both structurally and lexically. The outcomes of the study could be useful for all EFL learners and trainers. Furthermore EFL trainers can employ these findings when teaching Press Courses...|$|E
50|$|<b>Polysemes</b> {{are words}} {{with the same}} {{spelling}} and distinct but related meanings. The distinction between polysemy and homonymy is often subtle and subjective, and not all sources consider polysemous words to be homonyms. Words such as mouth, meaning either the orifice on one's face, or {{the opening of a}} cave or river, are polysemous and {{may or may not be}} considered homonyms.|$|R
40|$|WordNet [4] is the lexical {{database}} for English language. A synset is a WordNet structure for storing senses of the words. Synset contains {{a set of}} synonym words and their brief description called gloss. For example, well, wellspring and fountainhead have the same meaning according to WordNet, so these three words are grouped in to one synset which is explained by a gloss "an abundant source". A known problem of WordNet {{is that it is}} too fine-grained in its sense definitions. For instance, it does not distinguish between homographs (words that have the same spelling and different meanings) and <b>polysemes</b> (words that have related meanings). We propose to distinguish only between <b>polysemes</b> within WordNet while merging all homograph synsets. The ultimate goal is to compute a more coarse-grained version of linguistic database. 2 Meta matcher Meta matcher is designed as a WordNet matcher, i. e., a matcher that is effective in matching WordNet with itself.

40|$|In this article, {{we present}} {{a study on the}} polysemic network of the German {{preposition}} "über". Such study is the outcome of our master's dissertation research in which we are theoretically grounded on cognitive linguistics, particularly on studies of polysemy based on cognitive semantics. In order to set the polysemic semantic network, we used the model of Principled Polysemy presented by Andrea Tyler and Vyvyan Evans in the book "The semantics of English prepositions - spatial scenes, embodied meaning and cognition" (2003) and adapted it for the analysis of the preposition "über". In this article we will show the most productive meanings for such preposition. No presente artigo, apresentamos a rede polissêmica da preposição alemã "über", que é resultante da pesquisa produzida para a dissertação de mestrado. Como base teórica, fizemos uso dos preceitos da linguística cognitiva, mais especificamente dos estudos de polissemia que se baseiam na semântica cognitiva. Para definir a rede semântica polissêmica, utilizamos o modelo de Polissemia Sistemática apresentado por Andrea Tyler e Vyvyan Evans na obra "The semantics of English prepositions – spatial scenes, embodied meaning and cognition" (2003) e o adaptamos para a análise da preposição "über". Neste artigo, exporemos os significados mais produtivos para esta preposição. Im vorliegenden Artikel wird das <b>polyseme</b> Netz der deutschen Präposition "über" präsentiert, Ergebnis der Forschung für die Masterarbeit.

40|$|The Kamusi Project, a {{multilingual}} online dictionary website, has {{as one of}} {{its goals}} to document the lexicons of en-dangered and less-resourced languages (LRLs). Kamusi. org provides a unified platform and repository for this kind of data that is both simple to use and free to researchers and the public. Since Kamusi has a separate entry for each homophone or <b>polyseme,</b> {{it can be used to}} produce sophisticated multilingual dictionaries. We have recently been confronting issues inherent in contact language-based lexi-cography, especially the elicitation of culturally-specific semantic terms, which cannot be obtained through fieldwork purely reliant on a contact language. To address this, we have designed a system of “balloons. ” Based on a variety of fac-tors, balloons raise the likelihood of re-vealing terms and fields that have partic-ular relevance within a culture, rather than perpetuating linguistic bias toward the concerns and artifacts of more power-ful groups. Kamusi has also developed a smartphone application which can be used for crowdsourcing contributions and validation. It will also be invaluable in gathering oral data from speakers of en-dangered languages for the production of monolingual talking dictionaries. The first of these projects is planned for the Arrernte language in central Australia. ...|$|E
40|$|At {{the turn}} of the nineteenth century, most men wore suits. One easily gets the {{impression}} that all these men look more or less identical; the suits seem to resemble uniforms. Furthermore, compared to the women’s clothing of the period, the suit seems restrained and even drab in its shape and colour. The dissertation takes up this point and examines the claim that all men look alike in a suit. The purpose of the dissertation is to study what was signalled when groups as disparate as princes, artists and hod-carriers dressed in similar pieces of clothing. If there were, in fact, differences, of what did they consist; how did the men invest the suit with new and different meanings? This dissertation does not, however, focus exclusively on suits. The three groups of men wore work-specific clothes, as well. How might one interpret the contrasts between their work clothes and civilian attire? The primary source material consists of portraits of men from the three above-mentioned groups. The pictures are supplemented by an examination of some of the clothing actually used by men who belonged to the groups in question. Research into how princes, artists and hod-carriers dressed showed that these groups moved in different tension fields. These tension fields were created by historic and social problems with which the men had been forced to cope. The princes’ tension field was that of tradition/modernity, the artists’ that of boundary-crossing/conformity and the hod-carriers’ that of body/intellect. The men’s way of dressing, their appearing in both civilian and in work-related clothing, embodied a struggle both for the right to be included in modern society, and for the freedom to remain alien – or rather, for the right to be included on their own terms. The suit was <b>polyseme,</b> capable of denoting several different manly ideals and masculinities. It was a question of who the suit-wearing man was – the collective to which he belonged, as well as his personal style and taste, that determined the suit’s connotation. For this reason, the men's suits came to signal different things, even when their surface appearance was fairly uniform. However, variations did occur. The men exploited the margins of freedom available within male fashion. When the artists expanded the frames determining how a suit could be worn, they showed that male dress could vary even beyond what the decrees of fashion might allow...|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} tests for polysemy, {{but one of}} them is zeugma: if one word seems to exhibit zeugma when applied in {{different}} contexts, {{it is likely that the}} contexts bring out different <b>polysemes</b> of the same word. If the two senses of the same word do not seem to fit, yet seem related, then it is likely that they are polysemous. The fact that this test again depends on speakers' judgments about relatedness, however, means that this test for polysemy is not infallible, but is rather merely a helpful conceptual aid.|$|R

30|$|In the psycholinguistic literature, this homonymy/polysemy {{distinction}} {{has been}} operationalized using RELATEDNESS OF MEANING (henceforth, ROM) ratings, which are subjective ratings of how closely-related the meanings {{associated with a}} lexical form are (Azuma and Van Orden 1997; Durkin and Manning 1989). Homonyms like 1 tend to have lower ROM ratings; <b>polysemes</b> like 2 tend to have higher ROM ratings. The present study investigates how the meanings associated with an ambiguous word are accessed in sentential contexts, taking into consideration the relatedness among an ambiguous word’s meanings.

Furthermore, we report an advantage for words high in context availability but note that this advantage is qualified by both contextual diversity and orthographic neighborhood frequency. In contrast to past findings, ambiguity and context availability did not interact, although a novel interaction of ambiguity and contextual diversity is reported. We discuss the implications of these findings for the context availability hypothesis (Schwanenflugel & Shoben, 1983) ...|$|R

Next, synonyms {{in the language of}} law are considered with respect to their intension and distribution, and examples are given to show that most expressions or phrases which are interchangeable synonyms in the general language should be treated carefully in legal translation.

The ultimate goal of this exercise is to compute a more coarsegrained version of linguistic database. In order to achieve this task we propose to merge all polysemous senses according to similarity scores computed by a hybrid algorithm.

5000|$|A homonym is, in {{the strict}} sense, {{one of a}} group of words that share the same {{spelling}} and pronunciation but have different meanings.

The state of being a homonym is called homonymy. Examples of homonyms are the pair stalk (part of a plant) and stalk (follow/harass a person) and the pair left (past tense of leave) and left (opposite of right). A distinction is sometimes made between [...] "true" [...] homonyms, which are unrelated in origin, such as skate (glide on ice) and skate (the fish), and polysemous homonyms, or <b>polysemes,</b> which have a shared origin, such as mouth (of a river) and mouth (of an animal).|$|R
50|$|Some idioms are transparent. Much {{of their}} meaning does get through {{if they are}} taken (or translated) literally.

Transparency is a matter of degree; spill the beans (to let secret information become known) and leave no stone unturned (to do everything possible in order to achieve or find something) are not entirely literally interpretable, but only involve a slight metaphorical broadening. Another category of idioms is a word having several meanings, sometimes simultaneously, sometimes discerned from the context of its usage.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Martin {{points out}} the backgrounding of lexis in SFL, suggesting that this is related to an account of lexis as most delicate grammar.

The {{reason for this is}} that if we take as a starting point Halliday's  (1972 / 2013 : 8) view that “the output of any path through the network of systems is a structure”, the ‘most’ delicate system will lead directly to a lexical item (cf criticisms by Hunston and Francis, 2000 and Groom, 2005).
