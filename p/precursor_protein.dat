5|$|In a 2003 {{review of}} the literature, Rowan et al. {{proposed}} one model for how LTP might be affected in AD. AD appears to result, at least in part, from misprocessing of amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> (APP). The result of this abnormal processing is the accumulation of fragments of this protein, called amyloid β (Aβ). Aβ exists in both soluble and fibrillar forms. Misprocessing of APP results in the accumulation of soluble Aβ that, according to Rowan's hypothesis, impairs hippocampal LTP and {{may lead to the}} cognitive decline seen early in AD.|$|E
5|$|In a genome wide {{association}} screen (GWAS), CASS4 {{showed a}} significant correlation with clinical pathological features of AD such as neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques. Two additional CASS4 SNPs were reported {{to be associated with}} AD susceptibility: rs6024870, and rs16979934 T/G. Given the likely conserved CAS-family cytoskeletal function of CASS4, it has been speculated that it may have a role in axonal transport and influence the expression of the amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> (APP) and tau, which are pathologically affected in AD. Several possible mechanisms for CASS4 action in AD have been proposed.|$|E
5|$|The {{compound}} polyozellin—a chemical {{which can}} be isolated and purified from P.multiplex—inhibits prolyl endopeptidase (PEP), an enzyme that has a role in processing proteins (specifically, amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein)</b> in Alzheimer's disease. Chemicals that inhibit PEP have attracted research interest due to their potential therapeutic effects. Further analyses of extracts from P.multiplex revealed similar dibenzofuranyl derivatives of polyozellin, each with different chemical properties, including kynapcin-12, kynapcin-13 and -28, and -24. A total synthesis of kynapcin-24 was achieved in 2009.|$|E
40|$|The {{import of}} small <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins,</b> {{derived from the}} {{honeybee}} secretory protein prepromelittin, into dog pancreas microsomes is independent of signal recognition particle (SRP) and docking protein, but requires that charged amino acids at the amino terminus of the mature part are counterbalanced by amino acids with the opposite charge at the carboxy terminus. The import pathway of such <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> was resolved into two sequential steps: (i) binding of precursors to microsomes, and (ii) insertion of precursors into the membrane. Formation of an intramolecular disulfide bridge within the mature part of these <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> allowed association of the oxidized precursors with the microsomal membrane but reversibly inhibited their membrane insertion. Furthermore, membrane insertion was inhibited by ATP depletion. Different prepromelittin derivatives were found to depend on ATP to varying degrees. We conclude that insertion of prepromelittin-derived <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> into microsomal membranes involves a competent conformation of the <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> and that, in general, this is accomplished {{with the help of}} both a cytoplasmic component and ATP. ...|$|R
40|$|Posttranslational {{transfer}} of most <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> into mitochondria {{is dependent on}} energization of the mitochondria. Experiments were carried out {{to determine whether the}} membrane potential or the intramito-chondrial ATP is the immediate energy source. Transfer in vitro of precursors to the ADP/ATP carrier and to ATPase subunit 9 into isolated Neurospora mitochondria was investigated. Under conditions where the level of intramitochondrial ATP was high and the membrane potential was dissipated, import and processing of these <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> did not take place. On the other hand, precursors were taken up and processed when the intramitochondrial ATP level was low, but the membrane potential was not dissipated. We conclude that a membrane potential is involved in the import of those mitochondrial <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> which require energy for intracellular translocation The great majority of mitochondrial proteins are coded for by nuclear genes. They are synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes as <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins,</b> most but not all of which have higher apparent molecular weights than the mature <b>proteins.</b> These <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> are imported into the mitochondria in a posttranslational event [I- 1 I]...|$|R
40|$|Cytosol-synthesised {{chloroplast}} and mitochondrial <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> are proteolytically processed after import by highly specific, metal-dependent soluble enzymes: the stromal processing peptidase (SPP) and {{the matrix}} processing peptidase (MPP), respectively. We have used in vitro processing assays {{to compare the}} reaction specificities of highly purified preparations of pea SPP and Neurospora crassa MPP, {{both of which are}} unable to cleave a variety of 'foreign' proteins. We show that SPP can cleave all five mitochondrial <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> tested, namely cyclophilin, the beta subunit of the F- 1 -ATPase complex, the Rieske FeS protein, the alpha-MPP subunit and cytochrome b(2). In contrast, MPP is unable to cleave any chloroplast <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> tested. Several of the mitochondrial <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> are cleaved more efficiently by SPP than are many authentic chloroplast <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> but, in each case, cleavage takes place at a site or sites which are N-terminal to the authentic MPP site; pre-cyclophilin is cleaved 5 residues upstream of the MPP site and the precursor of the beta subunit of the F- 1 -ATPase complex is cleaved at sites 5 and 12 residues upstream. We discuss the implications of these data for the SPP reaction mechanism...|$|R
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease has}} been {{identified}} as a protein misfolding disease (proteopathy), caused by plaque accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid beta protein, and tau protein in the brain. Plaques are made up of small peptides, 39–43amino acids in length, called amyloid beta (Aβ). Aβ is a fragment from the larger amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> (APP). APP is a transmembrane protein that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival, and post-injury repair. In Alzheimer's disease, gamma secretase and beta secretase act together in a proteolytic process which causes APP to be divided into smaller fragments. One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of amyloid beta, which then form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as senile plaques.|$|E
5|$|The genetic {{heritability}} of Alzheimer's disease (and memory components thereof), {{based on}} reviews of twin and family studies, ranges from 49% to 79%. Around 0.1% {{of the cases}} are familial forms of autosomal (not sex-linked) dominant inheritance, which have an onset before age 65. This form of the disease is known as early onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Most of autosomal dominant familial AD {{can be attributed to}} mutations in one of three genes: those encoding amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> (APP) and presenilins 1 and 2. Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a small protein called Aβ42, which is the main component of senile plaques. Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between Aβ42 and the other major forms—particularly Aβ40—without increasing Aβ42 levels.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, the amyloid {{hypothesis}} {{postulated that}} extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits are the fundamental {{cause of the}} disease. Support for this postulate comes from {{the location of the}} gene for the amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> (APP) on chromosome 21, together with the fact that people with trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) who have an extra gene copy almost universally exhibit at least the earliest symptoms of AD by 40years of age. Also, a specific isoform of apolipoprotein, APOE4, is a major genetic risk factor for AD. While apolipoproteins enhance the breakdown of beta amyloid, some isoforms are not very effective at this task (such as APOE4), leading to excess amyloid buildup in the brain. Further evidence comes from the finding that transgenic mice that express a mutant form of the human APP gene develop fibrillar amyloid plaques and Alzheimer's-like brain pathology with spatial learning deficits.|$|E

Addition of proteases to cells {{infected with}} these mutants caused cleavage of the <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> Pr 65 gag and Pr 180 gag-pol to their mature forms at the nonpermissive temperature. Concomitantly there was release from the cells of morphologically normal virions. The enzymatically inactive Pr 180 gag-pol was cleaved to active reverse transcriptase (p 85), which {{was found in the}} released particles. External protease treatment apparently bypassed the lesion in these viral mutants, suggesting that their defect may involve a virus-specific protease...|$|R
40|$|Mitochondrial protein traffic {{requires}} precise {{recognition of}} the mitochondrial targeting signals by the import receptors on the mitochondrial surface including a general import receptor Tom 20 and a receptor for presequence-less proteins, Tom 70. Here we took a proteome-wide approach of mitochondrial protein import in vitro to find a set of presequence-containing <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> for recognition by Tom 70. The presequences of the Tom 70 -dependent <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> were recognized by Tom 20, whereas their mature parts exhibited Tom 70 -dependent import when attached to the presequence of Tom 70 -independent <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins.</b> The mature parts of the Tom 70 -dependent <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> have the propensity to aggregate, {{and the presence of}} the receptor domain of Tom 70 prevents their aggregate formation. Therefore Tom 70 plays the role of a docking site for not only cytosolic chaperones but also aggregate-prone substrates to maintain their solubility for efficient transfer to downstream components of the mitochondrial import machineries...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of plant}} {{mitochondrial}} outer membrane proteins {{in the process}} of preprotein import was investigated, as some of the principal components characterized in yeast {{have been shown to be}} absent or evolutionarily distinct in plants. Three outer membrane proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana mitochondria were studied: TOM 20 (translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane), METAXIN, and mtOM 64 (outer mitochondrial membrane protein of 64 kD). A single functional Arabidopsis TOM 20 gene is sufficient to produce a normal multisubunit translocase of the outer membrane complex. Simultaneous inactivation of two of the three TOM 20 genes changed the rate of import for some <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins,</b> revealing limited isoform subfunctionalization. Inactivation of all three TOM 20 genes resulted in severely reduced rates of import for some but not all <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins.</b> The outer membrane protein METAXIN was characterized to play a role in the import of mitochondrial <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> and likely plays a role in the assembly of β-barrel proteins into the outer membrane. An outer mitochondrial membrane protein of 64 kD (mtOM 64) with high sequence similarity to a chloroplast import receptor was shown to interact with a variety of <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins.</b> All three proteins have domains exposed to the cytosol and interacted with a variety of <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins,</b> as determined by pull-down and yeast two-hybrid interaction assays. Furthermore, inactivation of one resulted in protein abundance changes in the others, suggesting functional redundancy. Thus, it is proposed that all three components directly interact with <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> to participate in early stages of mitochondrial protein import...|$|R
25|$|The {{oxytocin}} peptide is synthesized as an inactive <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> {{from the}} OXT gene. This <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> {{also includes the}} oxytocin carrier protein neurophysin I. The inactive <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> is progressively hydrolyzed into smaller fragments (one of which is neurophysin I) via a series of enzymes.

40|$|The {{thylakoid}} twin arginine protein translocation (Tat) {{system is}} thought to have a multivalent receptor complex with each cpTatC-Hcf 106 pair constituting a signal peptide-binding unit. Conceptual models suggest that translocation of individual <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> occurs upon assembly of a Tha 4 oligomer with a precursor-occupied cpTatC-Hcf 106. However, results reported here reveal that multiple <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> bound to a single receptor complex can be transported together. <b>Precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> that contain one or two cysteine residues readily formed intermolecular disulphide bonds upon binding to the receptor complex, resulting in dimeric and tetrameric <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins.</b> Three lines of evidence indicate that all members of precursor oligomers were specifically bound to a receptor unit. Blue native–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that oligomers were present on individual receptor complexes rather than bridging two or more receptor complexes. Upon energizing the membrane, the dimeric and tetrameric precursors were transported across the membrane with efficiencies comparable with that of monomeric precursors. These results imply a novel aspect of Tat systems, whereby multiple precursor-binding sites can act in concert to transport an interlinked oligo-precursor protein...|$|R
25|$|Finally, Villa-Komaroff {{contributed to}} the {{discovery}} that a molecule known {{to be associated with}} Alzheimer’s disease (amyloid beta) causes degeneration of brain cells (neurons), work done in conjunction with a postdoctoral fellow in her laboratory, Bruce Yankner. Before this publication, it was unclear whether amyloid beta was a byproduct of neuronal degeneration or a contributor to that degeneration. This paper provided the first direct evidence that a fragment of the amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> could kill neurons, and helped stimulate a very large field dedicated to preventing and treating Alzheimer’s disease by targeting amyloid beta.|$|E
25|$|Gamma secretase is a multi-subunit {{protease}} complex, {{itself an}} integral membrane protein, that cleaves single-pass transmembrane proteins at residues within the transmembrane domain.

25|$|Ricin is {{synthesized}} in the endosperm of {{castor oil}} plant seeds. The ricin <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> is 576 amino acid residues {{in length and}} contains a signal peptide (residues 1–35), the ricin A chain (36–302), a linker peptide (303–314), and the ricin B chain (315–576). The N-terminal signal sequence delivers the prepropolypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then the signal peptide is cleaved off. Within the lumen of the ER the propolypeptide is glycosylated and a protein disulfide isomerase catalyzes disulfide bond formation between cysteines 294 and 318. The propolypeptide is further glycosylated within the Golgi apparatus and transported to protein storage bodies. The propolypeptide is cleaved within protein bodies by an endopeptidase to produce the mature ricin protein that is composed of a 267 residue A chain and a 262 residue B chain that are covalently linked by a single disulfide bond.|$|E
40|$|Two ATP-dependent cytosolic chaperones, {{mitochondrial}} import stimulation factor (MSF) and hsp 70, {{are known}} {{to be involved in the}} import of <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> into mitochondria. Hsp 70 generally recognizes unfolded proteins, while MSF specifically recognizes mitochondrial <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> and targets them to mitochondria in a NEM-sensitive manner. Here we analyzed the relative contribution of these chaperones in the import process and confirmed that the <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> are targeted to mitochondria via two distinct pathways: one requiring MSF and the other requiring hsp 70. Both pathways depend on distinct proteinaceous components of the outer mitochondrial membrane. The MSF-dependent pathway is NEM-sensitive and requires the hydrolysis of extra-mitochondrial ATP for the release of MSF from the mitochondrial import receptor, whereas the hsp 70 -dependent pathway is NEM-sensitive and does not require extra-mitochondrial ATP. The NEM-insensitive, hsp 70 -dependent import became NEM-sensitive depending on the amount of MSF added. The relative importance of the two pathways appears to be determined by the affinities of MSF and hsp 70 for the <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins...</b>|$|R

25|$|GAPDH {{has been}} implicated in several {{neurodegenerative}} diseases and disorders, largely through interactions with other proteins specific to that disease or disorder. These interactions may affect not only energy metabolism but also other GAPDH functions. For example, GAPDH interactions with beta-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> (betaAPP) could interfere with its function regarding the cytoskeleton or membrane transport, while interactions with huntingtin could interfere with its function regarding apoptosis, nuclear tRNA transport, DNA replication, and DNA repair. In addition, nuclear translocation of GAPDH {{has been reported in}} Parkinson's disease (PD), and several anti-apoptotic PD drugs, such as rasagiline, function by preventing the nuclear translocation of GAPDH. It is proposed that hypometabolism may be one contributor to PD, but the exact mechanisms underlying GAPDH involvement in neurodegenerative disease remains to be clarified. The SNP rs3741916 in the 5' UTR of the GAPDH gene may be associated with late onset Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has been}} ongoing {{over the past}} two decades to {{determine}} whether copper is a causative or a preventive agent of Alzheimer's disease. For example, as a possible causative agent or an expression of a metal homeostasis disturbance, studies indicate that copper may play a role in increasing the growth of protein clumps in Alzheimer's disease brains, possibly by damaging a molecule that removes the toxic buildup of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the brain. There is an association between a diet rich in copper and iron together with saturated fat and Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, studies also demonstrate potential beneficial roles of copper in treating rather than causing Alzheimer's disease. For example, copper has been shown to 1) promote the non-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid beta <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> (APP), thereby lowering amyloid beta (Aβ) production in cell culture systems 2) increase lifetime and decrease soluble amyloid production in APP transgenic mice, and 3) lower Aβ levels in cerebral spinal fluid in Alzheimer's disease patients.|$|E
25|$|Copper is {{imported}} into cells through the cell wall by the plasma {{membrane transport protein}} known as Copper Transporter 1, or Ctr1. Ctr1 rapidly binds to intracellular copper chaperone proteins. Atox1 delivers copper to the secretory pathway and docks with either copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B in the liver or ATP7A in other cells. ATP7B directs copper to plasma ceruloplasmin or to biliary excretion in concert with a newly discovered chaperone, Murr1, the protein missing in canine copper toxicosis. ATP7A directs copper within the trans-Golgi network to the proteins dopamine beta-monooxygenase, peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, lysyl oxidase, and tyrosinase, depending on the cell type. CCS is the copper chaperone for the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase that protects cells against reactive oxygen species; it delivers copper in the cytoplasm and intermitochondrial space. Cox17 delivers copper to mitochondria to cytochrome c oxidase via the chaperones Cox11, Sco1, and Sco2. Other copper chaperones may exist and might include metallothionein and amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> (APP). Genetic and nutritional studies have illustrated the essential nature of these copper-binding proteins.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{function}} of mitochondria {{depends on the}} import of proteins, which are synthesized as precursors on cytosolic ribosomes. The majority of the <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> are sorted into the mitochondrial subcompartments via five distinct routes. Recent studies revealed that molecular cooperation between protein machineries is a central feature of mitochondrial protein biogenesis. First, coupling to various partner proteins affects the substrate specificity of translocases and single translocation steps. Second, {{there is a substantial}} cooperation between different protein translocases in the import of specific <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins.</b> Third, protein transport is intimately linked to processing, folding and assembly reactions. Fourth, sorting of <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> is functionally and physically connected to protein machineries, which fulfill central functions for respiration, maintenance of membrane architecture and form contacts to the endoplasmic reticulum.

40|$|Two {{proteins}} co-operate in the proteolytic cleavage of mitochondrial precursor proteins: the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) and {{the processing}} enhancing protein (PEP).
