Through the <b>Passback</b> Program, new and gently used soccer gear is collected by organizations, teams, clubs, and individuals and is redistributed {{across the globe}} to help underserved communities play soccer.|$|E

He also began his own non-profit company called Filleo http://www.filleo.com in 2007. The company sells T-shirts and raises money to provide clothing and education to youth in need.|$|E
50|$|Since its inception, the Foundation has awarded over $57 {{million in}} {{financial}} support to soccer organizations and field-building initiatives nationwide. Through the <b>Passback</b> program, the Foundation has collected and redistributed close to 900,000 pieces of soccer equipment for children in need worldwide. In addition, the Foundation currently providing children in 20 {{cities across the country}} with physical activity, nutrition education and mentorship through our Soccer for Success program.|$|E

He is being recognized as an exemplary athlete within the community based on his work with the U.S. Soccer Foundations <b>Passback</b> Program and the establishment of his foundation, the Jose Luis Burciaga Jr. Foundation. Burciaga Jr.s foundation focuses on the positive impact of sports and the ideals of teamwork, discipline, and respect in the developing of young minds. The foundation promotes youth involvement in sports, education, community service and cultural awareness.|$|E
50|$|The {{game was}} played in unseasonally warm {{conditions}} with bright sunshine and a good natured atmosphere generated by both sets of fans. An early goal gave County a dream start {{but it was a}} nightmare for Queens and in particular goalkeeper David Hutton. Asked to deal with a routine <b>passback</b> by Queens captain David Lilley, a combination or poor decision making and poor ball control on Hutton's part allowed Andrew Barrowman to exert pressure and dispossess him. Barrowman easily rolled the ball into the empty net from one yard in the eighth minute to make the score 1-0 against his former club.|$|E
50|$|Focused on {{national}} teams (with {{a total of}} 64, all with fake names and individual team values), it {{had one of the}} highest option counts for 16-bit football games: up to 18 different settings can be changed, including ball weight, weather, surface, tightness of ball control, <b>passback</b> rule and perhaps the most remembered of all, the ability to play 6-on-6 indoor football. Several game modes are available, including friendlies, penalty shootout, Ultimate League, Ultimate Cup (group phase and knockout stage) and Knockout. However, the game lacks both passwords and battery save, and all competitions must be completed in one sitting. Up to eight players can play if two 4-player adapters are used.|$|E
50|$|The teams {{consist of}} ten players each (nine outfield and one goalkeeper). Team {{formation}} {{is controlled by}} the computer, with virtual players assuming predetermined positions for set pieces. As slide tackles are controlled by the computer there are no fouls and therefore no free kicks or penalties, and no yellow or red cards. No referee is shown on the field, although his whistle can be heard at the kick off, when the ball goes out of bounds or when a goal is scored. As Tehkan World Cup predates the <b>passback</b> rule, the goalkeeper will pick up the ball after receiving a pass from his own defenders. The offside rule is not enforced.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the youth}} ranks couldn’t contain the {{tenacious}} and brave midfield dynamo and he soon found himself {{promoted to the}} senior squad under Tommy McLean. He was a mainstay {{in the heart of}} the Motherwell midfield in the early to mid-nineties and formed part of a famous trio containing Paul Lambert and Billy Davies in ‘Well's fantastic team of 1994-1996. In one game on 7 December 1996, having started in his usual midfield role, he even played in goal for the last 30 minutes against Celtic when Motherwell goalkeeper Scott Howie was taken off injured. Although Celtic scored one goal past Dolan - more the result of a short <b>passback</b> than a goalkeeping error - Motherwell's Ian Ross scored in the last minute of the game to secure a heroic 2-1 victory.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} values and locations of Miles-in-Trail restrictions used within the National Airspace System {{over the last three}} years. Using specific severe weather avoidance routes, various locations are selected to implement the Miles-in-Trail restrictions to study their individual impact on the delay of flights and sector congestion in the airspace. The current traffic management operational infrastructure lacks the modeling of multiple restrictions with <b>passback</b> Miles-in-Trail values to upstream facilities. The model developed here allows implementation of multiple restriction locations for multiple merging streams of traffic. The model also permits speed control, vectoring or airborne holding, and <b>passback</b> of restrictions to upstream facilities. The simulation environment allows implementation of these restrictions, enabling a what-if capability in a rapid evaluation mode for Miles-in-Trail impact. Preliminary results are presented for delay of impacted flights due to implementation of three different playbook routes and Miles-in-Trail values at various locations with passbacks to upstream facilities. Results of sector congestion in the airspace for those cases are discussed as well. It was observed that for a particular playbook route implementation with Miles-in-Trail between 25 and 30 nmi applied at a reference fix resulted in low total delay and sector congestion. Overall, the model appears to be a good starting point for evaluation of <b>passback</b> restriction impact and, with operational feedback, could be used for advising <b>passback</b> values to upstream facilities.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{modeling of}} miles-in-trail <b>passback</b> restrictions {{for use in}} air traffic management. Generally, FAA managers employ miles-in-trail as a traffic management initiative when downstream traffic congestion at airports or in sectors is anticipated. In order to successfully implement the miles-in-trail at airspace fixes or navigational aids, it is desired that restriction values be computed for passing back to upstream facilities at specific boundaries. This paper presents a model {{which can be used}} for that purpose. This model improves on a previous version using traffic manager feedback resulting in significant improvement in guidance. The modeling approach is described along with lessons learned and improvements made during model development. Results for two sample traffic and one real traffic scenarios are presented. Additional operational considerations required by the traffic managers to implement the <b>passback</b> restrictions, namely maximum ground delay and absorbable airborne delay are incorporated in the model. A main result of this research is that absorbing small amount of ground and airborne delays are sufficient to handle the imposed constraint. Another finding is that implementing the <b>passback</b> restrictions provides the traffic managers ways to alleviate traffic constraints to help reduce excessive airborne delay for current traffic conditions...|$|E
