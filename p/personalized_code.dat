People could then use other AFIM fingerprint scanners to identify themselves and purchase items or obtain access to controlled locations and devices in a secured way.|$|E
30|$|The survey part of {{this project}} is {{based on data from}} a large sample of Norwegian adults {{employed}} in a full time or part time position. Subjects were recruited from organizations in Norway that were contacted and offered to participate in the study. In return for participating and making the data available for research, companies received written reports and oral presentations of results as a tool for organizational development and an aid for monitoring the organizational work environment. The survey was web-based, although participants with limited access to computers at work were given the option of filling out a paper version of the questionnaire. Employees and management in the companies were informed at the organizational level first and the participating enterprises were required to return an organization level questionnaire which asked about demographic information about the enterprise. Subsequently, all employees excluding those on sick leave were mailed a letter with information about the survey. This letter contained either a <b>personalized</b> <b>code</b> for logging into the web-questionnaire or a paper version of the questionnaire with a pre-stamped return envelope, in addition to information about the survey. The written information explained the aims of the study and assured that responses would be treated confidentially, in strict accordance with the general guidelines and specific license from The Norwegian Data Protection Authority. Employees were given the opportunity of filling out the questionnaire at work, but it was also possible to fill it out from home or any other location. Each subject had the opportunity to log into the web-questionnaire an unlimited number of times to change or complete their answers during the survey period.|$|E
5000|$|Observational and interventional {{methods of}} video recall {{are most often}} used in {{experimental}} measures of attribution, emotion and social interaction. Video recall is extremely useful because it can measure patterns in both everyday situations and experimental settings in a less intrusive way than a round table discussion. Video recall {{can be useful in}} both group and individual settings.Recall can also measure changes between gender, age, and other demographic factors, as it allows for specific time-stamping: it contains both quick reactions and long-term feelings. In Welsh's 2005 study of different techniques of video recall, he cites [...] "social constructionism, attachment theory, cognitive-behavioral theories, and symbolic interactionism as theories that are commonly measured through video recall. Much can be inferred from the relationship between cognitive processes and actual events, as it allows for more <b>personalized</b> <b>coding</b> and measurement.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the processes of}} building cooperation {{in a context of}} sparse public-sector regulation. The Nigerian and Ghanaian food sectors are characterized by a highly dispersed and fragmented system of micro-entrepreneurs from diverse ethnic groups who both compete and cooperate in order to flourish. Drawing on ethnographic research, we consider the relationships and contracts that require an element of cross-cultural trust, how personal social relations and institutional forms are used to ensure trust, and the role of cultural norms. Our empirical findings indicate that individuals draw on both personalized social relations and institutional forms of trust that are underpinned by culture specific norms. Through personalized trust, traders have been able to operate across cultural boundaries, building common norms of behavior over centuries, and shaping these into what are perceived essentially as professional, albeit <b>personalized,</b> <b>codes</b> of conduct and semi formal institutional forms (such as associations) that function in parallel to the state...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, mobile {{devices and}} {{applications}} offer new possibilities to learn anytime and anywhere. These technologies caused a disruption in traditional learning, {{opening up a}} new range of opportunities for learning at the workplace. Quick Response (QR) codes are one example of technology popularized with the adoption of mobile devices. When attached to an object or location, QR codes add a digital layer of information that transform and extend the way workers interact in their daily routines. This paper presents an illustrative scenario in which QR codes are used to support collaboration at the workplace. These QR codes are generated with etiquetAR, an authoring tool that allows creating <b>personalized</b> QR <b>codes</b> that users can access and contribute to with comments. In this scenario, QR codes act as the element for triggering interactions, opening a new communication space that promotes collaboration, sharing and discussion among workers while enhancing reflection and facilitating decision making processes...|$|R
50|$|Dorothy Rogers (1882 - 1952) was a famed {{creator of}} {{miniature}} needlework carpets exhibited during her lifetime and avidly collected after her death. Rogers began her lifetime obsession in her twenties while building a dollhouse for her young daughter. Her husband, an English army Colonel stationed in India, soon joined {{her in her}} craft, and the two spent decades engaged in intensive collaborative research and innovation. Rogers modeled many carpets on existing examples in prominent British collections (exploring Turkish, Shirvan, Caucasian, Daghestan, Hamadan, Khamseh, and Baluchi designs) while providing subtle alterations to existing styles. A number of Rogers' carpets contain <b>personalized</b> and possibly <b>coded</b> inscriptions.|$|R

The mail pieces feature direct response mechanisms such as a <b>personalized</b> URL, QR <b>code,</b> and texting to a short code number. The system tracks each response and sends an alert back to the user along with contact information for the new lead. The system also provides report generation functionality to assist users in evaluating {{the effectiveness of their}} direct marketing campaigns.|$|R
