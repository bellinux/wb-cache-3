Immediate concerns included the possibility of residents starving with most of the state's crops ruined. Yap Governor Tony Ganngiyan also issued {{a state of}} emergency on April1. On April9, the Congress of the Federated States of Micronesia held a special two-day session at the request of President Manny Mori, which included determination of typhoon relief funds. They allocated $1.5million toward relief for Chuuk and Yap States on April11. The president also issued a <b>price</b> <b>freeze</b> to pre-storm levels to prevent price gouging.|$|E
5|$|By 301, {{however, the}} system was in trouble, {{strained}} by a new bout of inflation. Diocletian therefore issued his Edict on Coinage, an act re-tariffing all debts so that the nummus, the most common coin in circulation, would be worth half as much. In the edict, preserved in an inscription {{from the city of}} Aphrodisias in Caria (near Geyre, Turkey), it was declared that all debts contracted before 1 September 301 must be repaid at the old standards, while all debts contracted after that date would be repaid at the new standards. It appears that the edict was made in an attempt to preserve the current price of gold and to keep the Empire's coinage on silver, Rome's traditional metal currency. This edict risked giving further momentum to inflationary trends, as had happened after Aurelian's currency reforms. The government's response was to issue a <b>price</b> <b>freeze.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Cindy {{became a}} {{tropical}} cyclone on August14, tropical storm warnings were issued for the Lesser Antilles from Martinique northward to the Virgin Islands. A tropical storm watch was posted for Puerto Rico at the time. The warnings, excluding {{those for the}} Virgin Islands, were discontinued on August15. As Cindy drifted further north later that day, the watch for Puerto Rico was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. Officials issued flash flood warnings for parts of the island, and about 600people living in flood-prone areas sought shelter ahead of the storm. Ferry service between Fajardo and the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques was suspended, leaving about 400passengers stranded for a day. A <b>price</b> <b>freeze</b> was placed on emergency supplies such as wood, nails, batteries, kerosene, and lanterns.|$|E

5|$|Bernardo Grinspun, {{the first}} {{minister}} of the economy, arranged an increase in wages, reaching the levels of 1975. This caused inflation to reach 32%. He also tried to negotiate more favourable terms on the country's foreign debt, but the negotiations failed. Risking a default, he negotiated with the IMF, which requested spending cuts. International credits prevented default {{at the end of}} 1984, but he resigned in March 1985 when the debt reached $1billion and the IMF denied further credits. Grinspun was succeeded by Juan Vital Sourrouille, who designed the Austral plan. This plan froze prices and wages, stopped the printing of money, arranged spending cuts, and established a new currency, the Austral. The plan was a success in the short term, and choked inflation. Inflation rose again {{by the end of the}} year, the CGT opposed the wage freeze, and business community opposed the <b>price</b> <b>freeze.</b> Alfonsín thought that the privatization of some state assets and a deregulation of the economy might work, but those proposals were opposed by both the PJ and his own party.|$|E
25|$|The {{wage and}} <b>price</b> <b>freeze</b> {{of the early}} eighties coupled with the removal of {{financial}} restrictions {{and a lack of}} investment opportunities, led to a speculative bubble on New Zealand's sharemarket, sharemarket crash of 1987, in which New Zealand's sharemarket shed 60% from its 1987 peak, and taking several years to recover.|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} of the Cruzado Plan was to eliminate inflation with a dramatic blow. Between 1980 and 1985, {{the rise in the}} CPI had escalated from 86.3% to 248.5% annually. Early in 1986, the situation became desperate, prodding the implementation of the plan. Its main measures were a general <b>price</b> <b>freeze,</b> a wage readjustment and freeze, readjustment and freeze on rents and mortgage payments, a ban on indexation, and a freeze on the exchange rate.|$|E
50|$|The {{exporters}} {{complained that}} heavy export tariffs compounded with the <b>price</b> <b>freezing</b> and {{prevented them from}} investing on more surveyance and further exploitation, thus leaving them unable {{to keep up with}} demand.

5000|$|Turner, 55, former MP for Ottawa-Orleans (1968-1976) and {{previously}} for St. Lawrence—St. George, Quebec (1962-1968), {{had served in}} Cabinet under Lester Pearson and Trudeau and had been Minister of Justice and Minister of Finance until resigning from cabinet in 1975 over a policy dispute over wage and <b>price</b> <b>freezes</b> [...] Since then, {{he had been a}} corporate lawyer on Bay Street until his return to politics in 1984. Turner had run for the leadership previously in 1968, placing third on the final ballot.|$|R
50|$|As the {{political}} transition developed, the economy suffered high inflation and stagnancy. Sarney {{tried to control}} inflation with many economic acts, or Plans: Plano Cruzado 1, Plano Cruzado 2, Plano Verão. All of them included government control over <b>prices,</b> <b>price</b> <b>freezes</b> and ultimately changing the national currency. During Sarneys's presidency, Brazil had three currency units: Cruzeiro, Cruzado and Cruzado Novo. Economic domestic troubles led to canceling payments of Brazilian International Debt in 1988. This closed international financial markets for Brazil and the economic situation worsened.|$|R
25|$|The {{two other}} {{stabilization}} plans amounted to renewed attempts at bringing inflation down from very high levels. It was soon clear {{that without a}} thorough reform of the public sector, controlling inflation would be impossible. Both plans introduced a <b>price</b> <b>freeze</b> and eliminated indexation, but there were differences between them, and with the Cruzado Plan. Neither was able to address the public-sector disequilibrium effectively. The objective of the Summer Plan, for instance, was mainly to avoid hyperinflation in an election year.|$|E
25|$|The plan's {{immediate}} {{results were}} spectacular: the monthly {{rate of inflation}} fell close to zero, economic growth surged upward, and the foreign accounts remained under control. However, {{by the end of}} 1986 the plan was in trouble. The wage adjustments were too large, increasing aggregate demand excessively and creating inflationary pressures. Moreover, the <b>price</b> <b>freeze</b> was maintained for too long, creating distortions and leading to shortages {{of a growing number of}} products. Inflation accelerated again and there was a return of indexation. The country imposed a moratorium on its foreign debt service on February 20, 1987.|$|E
25|$|Making {{inflation}} reduaction a top policy priority, Economy Minister José Ber Gelbard {{implemented the}} Social Pact, which Rucci {{signed with the}} Confederación General Económica (CGE) represiting management. The agreement, which proposed a <b>price</b> <b>freeze</b> and an increase of wages, was opposed both by the Peronist Left and by the employers' organizations, who claimed it went against free market precepts. Although Rucci was depicted by the Peronist Left {{as part of the}} Syndical Bureaucracy, according to the author Berzaba, he received no support, from either López Rega, UOM leader Lorenzo Miguel (a top Syndical Bureaucracy figure), or even Gelbard, once the latter had obtained his signature on the Social Pact.|$|E

25|$|To assist young farmers, {{the role}} of the SAFER (Societe d'Amenagemcnt Foncier et d'Etablissement Rural) was {{extended}} in 1982 to give preferential aid to this group to enlarge their holdings. Various measures were also introduced that helped to boost farmers’ incomes. A partial <b>price</b> <b>freeze</b> instituted in June 1982 helped to limit the increase in production costs, while an income assistance programme (introduced in 1982 to compensate for a decline in farmers’ incomes in 1981) contributed to a reduction in sectoral inequalities. In addition, an EEC price hike which the government negotiated in May 1982 represented an improvement over that of the previous year (11.2% compared with 10.3%). Consultative channels between farmers and government were also widened beyond the Federation Nationale des Syndicats d'Exploitants Agricoles (or FNSEA, the chief farming syndicat). In addition, the Mauroy Government had helped in the establishment of 12,000 farms with young farmers by mid-1983.|$|E
2500|$|With Think Big {{failing to}} deliver on its promise, Muldoon imposed a total freeze on wages, prices, {{interest}} rates and dividends {{across the country in}} April 1982, against a [...] "sweetener" [...] of a tax cut which cost the New Zealand treasury approximately a billion New Zealand dollars. Ultimately the Wage and <b>Price</b> <b>Freeze,</b> which had been intended only to last for a year, remained in force for nearly two years and was repealed by the incoming Labour Government.

25|$|An {{economic}} depression {{that began in}} 1972 was exacerbated by capital flight, plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits in response to Allende's socialist program. Production fell and unemployment rose. Allende adopted measures including <b>price</b> <b>freezes,</b> wage increases, and tax reforms, to increase consumer spending and redistribute income downward. Joint public-private public works projects helped reduce unemployment. Much of the banking sector was nationalized. Many enterprises within the copper, coal, iron, nitrate, and steel industries were expropriated, nationalized, or subjected to state intervention. Industrial output increased sharply and unemployment fell during the Allende administration's first year.|$|R

FHC had based his first presidential campaign in the then newly launched Real Plan and the promise of stabilizing the economy of Brazil. As a matter of fact, the plan had a positive effect during the first years of his administration, being able to curb the exorbitant inflation rates, stabilize the exchange rate, and increase the purchasing power of the Brazilian population without shocks or <b>price</b> <b>freezing.</b>|$|R

British Gas owner Centrica rose 8.1% and SSE shares were up 5.3%". BBC economics editor Robert Peston noted: [...] "To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory. There are a few reasons. One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted. Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government – and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge. Third, many investors tend to be economically Conservative and instinctively Conservative." ...|$|E

40|$|Prior to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, many U.

25|$|President Collor de Mello was impeached in September 1992 {{on charges}} of corruption. Vice {{president}} Itamar Franco {{was sworn in as}} president (1992–94), but he had to grapple to form a stable cabinet and to gather political support. The weakness of the interim administration prevented it from tackling inflation effectively. In 1993 the economy grew again, but with inflation rates higher than 30 percent a month, the chances of a durable recovery appeared to be very slim. At the end of the year, it was widely acknowledged that without serious fiscal reform, inflation would remain high and the economy would not sustain growth. This acknowledgment and the pressure of rapidly accelerating inflation finally jolted the government into action. The president appointed a determined minister of finance, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and a high-level team was put in place to develop a new stabilization plan. Implemented early in 1994, the plan met little public resistance because it was discussed widely and it avoided <b>price</b> <b>freezes.</b>|$|R

In 1970, Congress had granted the President the power to impose wage and <b>price</b> <b>freezes,</b> though the Democratic majorities, knowing Nixon had opposed such controls through his career, did not expect Nixon to actually use the authority.

40|$|In this article, price {{changes for}} {{pharmaceuticals}} in Germany are modelled {{as a function}} of regulation and competition. Changes in the regulatory environment, and in the competitive environment of a product, are taken into account. To follow the hierarchical structure, a four-level random intercept model was constructed. Price changes were allowed to vary randomly between drug classes, between different substances within a drug class, and between different manufacturers of a substance. This study provides evidence that two policy measures - reference pricing and temporary <b>price</b> <b>freezes</b> - succeeded in reducing prices in Germany between January 2004 and June 2006. For off-patent substances - depending on the competition faced by a drug - the effect of competition can be greater than the effect of regulation. The study, therefore, not only demonstrates the importance of competition between and within drug classes, it also provides evidence that generic entry has substantial effects on the prices of branded products. ...|$|R
