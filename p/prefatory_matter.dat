The first list fragment contains the end of the list for the Gospel of Matthew. The missing names from Matthew would require an additional two folios. The second list fragment, on folio 26, contains about a fourth of the list for Luke. The list for Luke would require an additional three folios. The structure of the quire in which folio 26 occurs is such that it is unlikely that there are three folios missing between folios 26 and 27, so that it is almost certain that folio 26 is not now in its original location. There is no trace of the lists for Mark and John.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} Byrd and Tallis were jointly {{granted a}} patent for the printing {{of music and}} ruled music paper for 21 years, {{one of a number}} of patents issued by the Crown for the printing of books on various subjects. The two musicians used the services of the French Huguenot printer Thomas Vautrollier, who had settled in England and previously produced an edition of a collection of Lassus chansons in London (Receuil du mellange, 1570). The two monopolists took advantage of the patent to produce a grandiose joint publication under the title Cantiones quae ab argumento sacrae vocantur. It was a collection of 34 Latin motets dedicated to the Queen herself, accompanied by elaborate <b>prefatory</b> <b>matter</b> including poems in Latin elegiacs by the schoolmaster Richard Mulcaster and the young courtier Ferdinand Heybourne (aka Richardson). There are 17 motets each by Tallis and Byrd, one for each year of the Queen's reign.|$|E

60|$|It has {{appeared}} {{to me to be}} part of my duty to point out here and there, but by no means frequently, some special beauty in the poem; occasionally also something which seems to me defective or faulty. I am aware that this latter is an invidious office, which naturally exposes one to an imputation, from some quarters, of obtuseness, and, from others, of presumption; none the less I have expressed myself with the frankness which, according to my own view, belongs to the essence of such a task as is here undertaken. Adonais is a composition which has retorted beforehand upon its actual or possible detractors. In the poem itself, and in the <b>prefatory</b> <b>matter</b> adjoined to it, Shelley takes critics very severely to task: but criticism has its discerning and temperate, as well as its 'stupid and malignant' phases.|$|E
60|$|This {{volume is}} {{the first of a series}} {{designed}} by the Author with the purpose of placing in the hands of the public, in more serviceable form, those portions of his earlier works which he thinks deserving of a permanent place in the system of his general teaching. They were at first intended to be accompanied by photographic reductions of the principal plates in the larger volumes; but this design has been modified by the Author's increasing desire to gather his past and present writings into a consistent body, illustrated by one series of plates, purchasable in separate parts, and numbered consecutively. Of other <b>prefatory</b> <b>matter,</b> once intended,--apologetic mostly,--the reader shall be spared the cumber: and a clear prospectus issued by the publisher of the new series of plates, as soon as they are in a state of forwardness.|$|E
60|$|I {{know that}} {{a good deal of}} {{latitude}} is allowed to advocates, when opening a cause in a private court, to indulge themselves in their narratives leading to the charges they intend to bring. They are not always called to the strictest account for such <b>prefatory</b> <b>matter,</b> because the court, when it comes to judge, sifts and distinguishes it from the points to be strictly proved, and on whose merits the cause relies. But I wish your Lordships to know, that, with the high opinion I have of your gravity, (and it is impossible for a man to conceive a higher,) and sensible of the weight of those I represent at this place, namely, the Commons of Great Britain, I should be sorry that any one substantial fact, even in this explanatory opening, or even the color of the fact, should be alleged, which, when called upon, I should not be ready to make good to you by proof,--I mean, by proof adapted to its nature: public opinion, by evidence of public opinion; by record, that to which record is applicable; by oral testimony, things to which oral testimony alone can be produced; and, last of all, that which is matter of historic proof, by historic evidence. This I hope to do with the usual allowance to errors and mistakes, which is the claim of human infirmity.|$|E

If they drag me into the Court, obtorto collo, instead of going into this scheme of arrangement, they would do themselves a great injury, and, perhaps, eventually do me good, though it would give me much pain. James Ballantyne is severely critical on what he calls imitations of Mrs. Radcliffe in Woodstock. Many will think with him, yet I am of opinion he is quite wrong, or, as friend J. F[errier] says, vrong[145] In the first place, I am to look on the mere fact of another author having treated a subject happily as a bird looks on a potato-bogle which scares it away from a field otherwise as free to its depredations as any one's else! In 2d place, I have taken a wide difference: my object is not to excite fear of supernatural tilings in my reader, but to show the effect of such fear upon the agents in the story--one a man of sense and firmness--one a man unhinged by remorse--one a stupid uninquiring clown--one a learned and worthy, but superstitious divine. In the third place, the book turns on this hinge, and cannot want it. But I will try to insinuate the refutation of Aldiboronti's exception into the <b>prefatory</b> <b>matter.</b>|$|E

5000|$|For Shakespeare, the First Folio of 1623 is {{the crucial}} document; of the 36 plays {{contained}} in that collection, 18 {{have no other}} source. The other 18 plays had been printed in quarto form at least once between 1594 and 1623, but since the <b>prefatory</b> <b>matter</b> in the First Folio itself warns against earlier texts, which are termed [...] "stol'n and surreptitious copies, maimed and deformed by frauds and stealths of injurious impostors", 18th- and 19th-century editors of Shakespeare tended to ignore the quarto texts and preferred the Folio.|$|E
50|$|Giovanni Battista Ramusio first {{includes}} Odoric's {{narrative in}} the second volume of the second edition (1574) (Italian version), in which are given two versions, differing curiously from one another, but without any <b>prefatory</b> <b>matter</b> or explanation.

5000|$|The Fatal Contract {{was most}} likely written in the 1638-39 period, and was acted, {{probably}} in the latter year, by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Salisbury Court Theatre. Heminges's primary source for plot materials was the General Inventory of the History of France by Jean de Serres, published in English in 1607. The play was first printed in 1653, in a quarto issued by the actor turned stationer Andrew Pennycuicke. (The edition's preface is co-signed by [...] "A. T.," [...] thought to be Anthony Turner.) The booksellers dedicated the play to the Earl and Countess of Nottingham. The <b>prefatory</b> <b>matter</b> in that edition indicates that Heminges was deceased by 1653.

5000|$|The 1647 folio was {{published}} by the booksellers Humphrey Moseley and Humphrey Robinson. It was modelled on the precedents {{of the first two}} folio collections of Shakespeare's plays, published in 1623 and 1632, and the first two folios of the works of Ben Jonson of 1616 and 1640-1. The title of the book was given as Comedies and Tragedies Written by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher Gentlemen, though the <b>prefatory</b> <b>matter</b> in the folio recognised that Philip Massinger, rather than Francis Beaumont, collaborated with Fletcher on some of the plays included in the volume. (In fact, the 1647 volume [...] "contained almost nothing of Beaumont's" [...] work.) Seventeen works in Fletcher's canon that had already been published prior to 1647, and the rights to these plays belonged to the stationers who had issued those volumes; Robinson and Moseley therefore concentrated on the previously unpublished plays in the Fletcher canon.|$|E
5000|$|Newes out of Paules Churchyarde, A Trappe for Syr Monye, first {{appeared}} in 1567, but no copy of this impression is known, and it was re-issued in 1579 with the name given above. The book {{takes the form of}} a dialogue between Bertulph and Paul, who meet in the aisles of the cathedral, and is divided into eight satyrs, dealing with the corruption of the higher clergy and of judges, the greed of attorneys, the tricks of physicians and apothecaries, the sumptuary laws, extravagant living, Sunday sports, the abuse of St Paul's cathedral as a meeting-place for business and conversation, usury, and so on. It is written in rhymed fourteen-syllable metre, which is often more comic than the writer meant. It contains, amid much <b>prefatory</b> <b>matter,</b> a [...] "note to the carping and scornefull Sicophant," [...] in which he attacks his foes with small courtesy and much alliteration. One is described as a [...] "carping careless cankerd churle." ...|$|E
5000|$|Close {{analysis}} of these illuminations reveals a gradual transformation from the conventional and textually unrelated images that were common {{at the time and}} that are found {{at the beginning of the}} manuscript (the famous frontispiece is an exception, having been added later) to largely unique and textually based ones further on. This indicates a change in attitude toward the illuminated initial on the part of the artist only after production had begun, something that was not part of the original conception. More specifically, after initially illuminating this patristic work in a conventional and unexceptional manner in the illuminations in the beginning of the book, the artist gradually began to internalize the exegetical principals laid out by Gregory in the Letter to Leander (that is part of the <b>prefatory</b> <b>matter</b> of the book), in particular, Gregory's demand that one [...] "become" [...] what one reads. In the same way that Gregory found it acceptable to analyze a line or even a word of text out of context, according to modern sensibilities, so the artist was quite willing to do the same, often with reference to the contemporary monastic polemics of reform. The end result was the exegetical spiritualization of the first generation Cistercian experience, the visual expression of Gregory's exegetical method.|$|E
5000|$|The scene {{shown in}} The Distrest Poet was {{probably}} inspired by Alexander Pope's satirical poem The Dunciad, most likely by the <b>prefatory</b> <b>matter</b> {{of the second}} version, the Dunciad Variorum which had been published in 1735, and in which Pope confirmed his authorship of the original. The painting and early states of the print included a quotation from Pope's work: Studious he sate, with all his books around,Sinking from thought to thought, a vast profound:Plunged for his sense, but found no bottom there;Then wrote and flounder'd on, in mere despair. The bill stuck to {{the wall above the}} poet's head originally featured a reference to Pope in which he was punningly mocked as [...] "His Holiness Pope Alexander", depicted as an ape wearing a papal tiara with an ass as his Prime Minister. The initial states of the print kept the quotation but replaced the genuine bill with a representation (which appears to have been entirely invented by Hogarth rather than copied from a real bill) of Pope clashing with Edmund Curll over the unauthorised publication of the poet's correspondence. Although Hogarth and Pope had never met, this literary inspiration led to speculation as to the identity of Hogarth's poet as one of the targets of Pope's satire. Ned Ward, the author of The London Spy was a strong contender, as was Lewis Theobald, to whom the lines quoted from Pope in Hogarth's original print referred.|$|E
50|$|The extant book {{contains}} preliminary matter, {{the complete}} {{text of the}} Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, and the Gospel of John through John 17:13. The remainder of John and an unknown amount of the preliminary matter is missing and was perhaps lost when the book was stolen early in the 11th century. The remaining preliminary matter consists of two fragmentary lists of Hebrew names contained in the Gospels, Breves causae (Gospel summaries), Argumenta (short biographies of the Evangelists), and Eusebian canon tables. It is probable that, like the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Books of Durrow and Armagh, part of the lost preliminary material included the letter of Jerome to Pope Damasus I beginning Novum opus, in which Jerome explains the purpose of his translation. It is also possible, though less likely, that the lost material included the letter of Eusebius to Carpianus, in which he explains {{the use of the}} canon tables. Of all the insular Gospels, only the Lindisfarne manuscript contains this letter.There are two fragments of the lists of Hebrew names; one on the recto of the first surviving folio and one on folio 26, which is currently inserted {{at the end of the}} <b>prefatory</b> <b>matter</b> for John. The first list fragment contains the end of the list for the Gospel of Matthew. The missing names from Matthew would require an additional two folios. The second list fragment, on folio 26, contains about a fourth of the list for Luke. The list for Luke would require an additional three folios. The structure of the quire in which folio 26 occurs is such that it is unlikely that there are three folios missing between folios 26 and 27, so that it is almost certain that folio 26 is not now in its original location.
