60|$|As {{he walked}} along (through {{a kind of}} dream, though he seemed so sensibly observant of trifling things around him,) he failed to notice that the path grew {{somewhat}} less distinctly marked, more infringed upon by grass, more shut in by shrubbery; he had deviated into a side track, and, in fact, a certain <b>printed</b> <b>board</b> nailed against a tree had escaped his notice, warning off intruders with inhospitable threats of prosecution. He began to suspect {{that he must have}} gone astray when the path led over plashy ground with a still fainter trail of preceding footsteps, and plunged into shrubbery, and seemed on the point of deserting him altogether, after having beguiled him thus far. The spot was an entanglement of boughs, and yet did not give one the impression of wildness; for it was the stranger's idea that everything in this long cultivated region had been touched and influenced by man's care, every oak, every bush, every sod,--that man knew them all, and that they knew him, and by that mutual knowledge had become far other {{than they were in the}} first freedom of growth, such as may be found in an American forest. Nay, the wildest denizens of this sylvan neighborhood were removed in the same degree from their primeval character; for hares sat on their hind legs to gaze at the approaching traveller, and hardly thought it worth their while to leap away among some ferns, as he drew near; two pheasants looked at him from a bough, a little inward among the shrubbery; and, to complete the wonder, he became aware of the antlers and brown muzzle of a deer protruding among the boughs, and though immediately there ensued a great rush and rustling of the herd, it seemed evidently to come from a certain lingering shyness, an instinct that had lost its purpose and object, and only mimicked a dread of man, whose neighborhood and familiarity had tamed the wild deer almost into a domestic creature. Remembering his experience of true woodland life, the traveller fancied that it might be possible to want freer air, less often used for human breath, than was to be found anywhere among these woods.|$|E

50|$|By the mid '60s, {{the company}} began {{actively}} promoting its products by advertising in technical journals as natural consequence of a growing business, thanks to its first large-scale commercialized radio transceiver: the 3-channel 3-B3 and later the RT450 (1966), capable of aggregating 48 channels into UHF band. The RT450 equipment was also certified by :it:Telettra under the commercial name H450 as fallback link for its high-capacity solutions. Power-line communication systems were also manufactured by the company in those years along with the first fixed and mobile communication terminals in VHF band (1972) for vehicular communications (precurring modern mobile phones) and anti burglar alarm systems.By 1973, a whole new internal division was created {{for the design of}} television broadcasting equipments (repeaters and transmitters) whose main customer was the national television company RAI. The first television products were based on thermo-ionic tubes though the improvement of solid state technologies soon replaced vacuum tubes. Similar improvements in <b>printed</b> <b>board</b> manufacturing made microstrip circuits a viable solution for increasingly-high microwave frequencies and in 1978 the RT12 radio equipment boasted the first direct-conversion 2.3 GHz synthesized modulator and could aggregate 120 telephone channels. In these years, the company manufactured the historical link to connect the Milan and Rome branches of the Corriere della Sera newspaper.|$|E
