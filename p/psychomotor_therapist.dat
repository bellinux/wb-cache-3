40|$|ObjectiveThe {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to evaluate the effect of a brief body and movement oriented intervention on aggression regulation and eating disorder pathology for individuals with eating disorders. MethodIn a first randomized controlled trial, 40 women were allocated to either the aggression regulation intervention plus supportive contact or a control condition of supportive contact only. The intervention was delivered by a <b>psychomotor</b> <b>therapist.</b> Participants completed questionnaires on anger coping and eating disorder pathology. Independent samples t-tests were performed on the difference between pre-treatment and post-treatment scores. ResultsTwenty-nine participants completed questionnaires at pre-intervention and post-intervention. The intervention resulted in a significantly greater improvement of anger coping, as well as of eating disorder pathology. DiscussionResults indicate that body and movement-oriented aggression regulation may be a viable add-on for treating eating disorders. It tackles a difficult to treat emotion which may have a role in blocking the entire process of treating eating disorders.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{objective}} is to evaluate a body and movement-oriented intervention on aggression regulation, specifically aimed towards reducing anger internalization in patients with an eating disorder. MethodPatients were randomized to treatment-as-usual (TAU) plus the intervention (n= 38) or to TAU only (n= 32). The intervention was delivered by a <b>psychomotor</b> <b>therapist.</b> TAU consisted of multidisciplinary day treatment (3 - 5 days per week during 3 - 9 months). Anger coping (Self-Expression and Control Scale) and eating pathology (Eating Disorder Examination-Self-report Questionnaire) were measured at baseline and follow-up. Differences between pre-intervention and post-intervention scores were tested by using repeated measures ANOVA. ResultsThe intervention group showed a significantly larger decrease of anger internalization {{than the control group}} ((2) = 0. 16, p= 0. 001). Both groups showed a significant reduction in eating pathology, but differences between groups were not significant. DiscussionA body and movement-oriented therapy seems a viable add-on for treating anger internalization in patients with an eating disorder.

40|$|Psychomotor {{therapy is}} defined as a method of {{treatment}} based on a holistic view of the human being that is derived from the unity of body and mind. Assessments (observation and/or evaluation) are essential to achieving concrete psychosocial objectives methodically. Psychomotor therapy uses movement, body awareness and a wide range of movement activities to optimize movement behavior as well as the cognitive, affective and relational aspects of psychomotor functioning (i. e., the relationships between physical movements and cognitive and social affective aspects). Consequently, the approach to this type of therapy integrates the physical, cognitive and emotional aspects of functioning in relation to the capacity of being and acting in a psychosocial context in order to achieve clearly defined goals in consultation with the patients. Psychomotor therapy framework consists of three different approaches a health-related approach, a psychosocial approach and a psychotherapeutic approach which can be embedded in several psychotherapeutic approaches. Through the implementation of both systematically planned evaluations and individually targeted interventions in group, the <b>psychomotor</b> <b>therapist</b> strives to broaden the general action competences and specific skills, and to stimulate a positive self-image and personal well-being in balanced social relationships. Today, there is sufficient evidence that psychomotor therapy has a major contribution to both wellbeing and mental health of patients with severe psychiatric problems. In Flemish psychiatric hospitals, psychomotor therapy is imbedded in different treatment programs. In this chapter the theory behind this approach and some practical examples will be provided. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Aim: This study aim {{to explore}} Norwegian {{psychomotor}} physiotherapist {{in private practice}} experience with the diagnosis written on their patients referrals. Background: It is the diagnosis on the referral from the doctor, chiropractor or manual therapist, which is registrated at HELFO, the Healhteconomy Administration, when psychomotor physiotherapists claim Gouverment Welfare for their patient threatments. The <b>psychomotor</b> <b>therapists</b> own examination or opinion about the patient is not registred. The fact is HELFO make healthstatistics of the psychomotor physiotherapists work using the diagnosis written on the referrals and not by the examination made by the psyckomotor physioterapist. My opinion {{is that it is}} a discrepancy between the psykomotor physiotherapist excamination of the patient versus the diagnosis written by the person who made the referral. This phenomenon will be further explored in this study. Research question: Norwegian psychomotor physiotherapist in private practice experience with the diagnosis written on their patients referrals. 1) How do a selection of Norwegian psychomotor physiotherapist describe their rewiews of the needs of their patients treated by them? 2) How does the psychomotor physiotherapists examination fit compared to the diagnosis on the referrals and the statistics from HELFO? Theoretical frame: This study is based on a phenomenological scientific theory. It is also based on theory about Norwegian psychomotor physiotherapy, HELFO (the Healhteconomy Administration), understanding of illness, profession theories and power theories. Method and design: This study is a qualitative study with an explorative and descriptive design. Four psychomotor physiotherapist has been interviewed using a halfstructured interviewguide and the datamaterial has been constructed by transcription and analysed by using the ”Systematic Textcondensation” by Malterud 2003. Main results and Conclusion: The experience of the needs of their patients, the psychomotor physiotherapist interviewed had, was that it is mainly patients with ”mixt problems” and a wish for a better life. They do not want life to be like it is now, but they do not know how to manage to change it. Sometimes they even do not know what to expect or what to ask for. The body is also important in the psychomotor physiotherapists examination of the patients as well as time. It occured that there were hidden psychiatric illness. This study pinpoint the fact that it is a discrepansy in the psychomotor physiotherapists excamination and the diagnosis on the patients referral and this may lead to a misleading statistics from HELFO. It seems like the referrals are based on coincidences and ignorance. An explanation why it is like this may be different view of health understanding or ignorance of the way the referrals are handled. This may cause a wrong picture of the work done by the sychomotor physiotherapists in health care and give a incomplete basis for healthpolitical prioritie...|$|R
40|$|Masteroppgave i psykisk helseHensikt: Studiens hensikt var å bidra til økt kunnskap om psykomotorisk fysioterapi til tenåringer. Forskningsspørsmålene var: 1. Hvor utbredt er det blant psykomotoriske fysioterapeuter å arbeide med tenåringer? 2. Hva kjennetegner psykomotoriske fysioterapeuter som arbeider med tenåringer? 3. Hva er de vanligste grunnene til at tenåringer går til psykomotorisk fysioterapi? 4. Kan psykomotorisk fysioterapi bidra til å hjelpe tenåringer til å mestre sitt eget liv? 5. Hvilke utfordringer har psykomotorisk fysioterapi når det gjelder arbeid med tenåringer? Metode: Det ble brukt et semistrukturert spørreskjema som ble sendt ut elektronisk til 398 psykomotoriske fysioterapeuter. Det kom inn 184 svar (svarprosent: 46). 86, 3 % av respondentene var kvinner. Resultatene ble analysert ved bruk av statistikkprogrammet SPSS (19. 0) og systematisk tekstkondensering. Dette var en tverrssnittstudie for år 2010. Resultater: Seks av ti respondenter arbeidet med tenåringer, med gjennomsnittlig syv tenåringspasienter hver. Flere kvinner (84, 8 %) enn menn (15, 2 %) arbeidet med tenåringer, men det var en noe større prosentandel blant menn (64 %) enn blant kvinner (60, 1 %), som arbeidet med tenåringer. Gjennomsnittsalderen var høyere blant de som arbeidet med tenåringer enn blant de som ikke gjorde det. Videre viste resultatene at jo eldre respondentene var, jo oftere arbeidet de med tenåringer. For eksempel arbeidet 68, 3 % av de i alderen 60 - 69 år med tenåringer, mens 50 % av de i alderen 30 - 39 år gjorde det. Det var omtrent like mange med videreutdanning i psykomotorisk fysioterapi etter ny og gammel ordning som arbeidet med tenåringer. Innenfor hver av disse gruppene arbeidet statistisk signifikant flere blant de med videreutdanning etter gammel ordning (70, 7 %) enn etter ny ordning (53, 6 %), med tenåringer. 43, 8 % av alle respondentene som arbeidet med tenåringer, hadde 0 - 9 års arbeidserfaring. Men resultatene viste at jo lengre arbeidserfaring de hadde, jo større prosentandel blant dem arbeidet med tenåringer. For eksempel arbeidet 76, 9 % av de med 30 - 39 års arbeidserfaring med tenåringer, mens 54, 8 % av de med 0 - 9 års arbeidserfaring gjorde det. Det var en liten overvekt av spesialister i psykomotorisk fysioterapi som arbeidet med tenåringer sammenlignet med de som ikke var spesialister, men omtrent like mange prosent innenfor hver av disse gruppene arbeidet med tenåringer. De vanligste grunnene til at tenåringer gikk til psykomotorisk fysioterapi var; hodepine, muskel- og skjelettplager, angst, uspesifiserte kroppslige symptomer, depresjon, utmattelse, anspenthet/spenninger, spiseforstyrrelser, pusteproblemer, uro, ADHD og stress. Resultatene viste at psykomotorisk fysioterapi kan bidra til å hjelpe tenåringer til å mestre sitt eget liv ved å: (1) ha en nær arbeidsallianse over tid med tenåringer; (2) møte tenåringer med anerkjennelse og bekreftelse; (3) ha en kroppslig tilnærming til tenåringenes plager; (4) gi tenåringer økt forståelse av sine plager; (5) gjøre tenåringer tryggere på sine egne grenser; (6) gi tenåringer større kroppslig trygghet; og (7) gi de økt selvtillit og økt mestring i sosiale sammenhenger. Respondentene hadde følgende tanker om hvilke utfordringer psykomotorisk fysioterapi har når det gjelder arbeid med tenåringer: (1) lite modenhet og refleksjonsevne hos tenåringer; (2) høy {{drop-out}} fra behandlingstimer; (3) alliansebygging (å etablere tillit, å ha tålmodighet og å ”treffe” tenåringer); (4) å ha en forsiktig nok tilnærming til kroppen; (5) å fokusere på mestring istedenfor å sykeliggjøre pasienten; (6) å samarbeide med foreldrene til tenåringene; (7) å tilpasse metoden til tenåringer; og (8) at psykomotorisk fysioterapi er et lite kjent behandlingstilbud blant potensielle samarbeidspartnere. Konklusjon: Psykomotorisk fysioterapi til tenåringer er relativt lite utbredt. Det som kjennetegner de som arbeider mest med tenåringer (sett i forhold til antallet psykomotoriske fysioterapeuter) er: høy alder, lang arbeidserfaring og videreutdanning etter gammel ordning. Menn arbeider relativt sett noe mer med tenåringer enn kvinner. Tenåringer går til psykomotorisk fysioterapi på grunn av både kroppslige og psykiske plager. Psykomotorisk fysioterapi kan på mange måter bidra til at tenåringer kan mestre livet sitt bedre, og er relevant innen psykisk helsearbeid. Psykomotorisk fysioterapi har også flere utfordringer når det gjelder arbeid med tenåringer.

Engelsk sammendrag (abstract) : Aim: The study's {{purpose was}} to contribute to increased knowledge of psychomotor physiotherapy for teenagers. Research questions were: 1. How widespread is it among psychomotor physiotherapists to work with teenagers? 2. What characterizes the psychomotor physiotherapists who work with teenagers? 3. What {{is the most common}} reasons that teenagers go to psychomotor physiotherapy? 4. Can psychomotor physiotherapy contribute to help teenagers to cope with their own lives? 5. What challenges does psychomotor physiotherapy have when it comes to working with teenagers? Method: It was used a semi-structured questionnaire that was sent out electronically to 398 <b>psychomotor</b> <b>therapists.</b> There were 184 responses (response rate: 46). 86. 3 % of the respondents were women. The results were analyzed using the statistical program SPSS (19. 0) and systematic text condensation. This was a cross section study for year 2010. Results: Six out of ten respondents worked with teenagers, with an average of seven adolescent patients each. More women (84. 8 %) than men (15. 2 %) worked with teenagers, but it was a slightly greater percentage of men (64 %) than among women (60. 1 %), working with teenagers. The average age was higher among those who worked with teenagers than among those who did not. Furthermore, the results showed that the older the respondents were, the more often they worked with teenagers. For example, 68. 3 % of those aged 60 - 69 years worked with teenagers, while 50 % of those aged 30 - 39 years worked with teenagers. It was about the same number of further education in psychomotor physiotherapy for the new and old scheme, working with teenagers. Within each of these groups, statistically there were significantly more among those with further education under the old scheme (70. 7 %) than under the new scheme (53. 6 %), working with teenagers. 43. 8 % of all respondents who worked with teenagers, had 0 - 9 years of work experience. But the results showed that the longer the work experience they had, the greater the percentage of those working with teenagers. For example, 76. 9 % of those with 30 - 39 years of work experience worked with teenagers, while 54. 8 % of those with 0 - 9 years of work experience worked with teenagers. There was a slight preponderance of specialists in psychomotor physiotherapy working with teenagers compared with those who were not specialists, but about the same percentage in each of these groups work with teenagers. The most common reasons that teenagers went to psychomotor physiotherapy were: headache, musculoskeletal disorders, anxiety, unspecified bodily symptoms, depression, fatigue, tension, eating disorders, breathing problems, unrest, ADHD and stress. The results showed that psychomotor physiotherapy can contribute to help teenagers to cope with their own lives by: (1) Having a close working alliance over time with teenagers; (2) Meeting the teenagers with recognition and verification; (3) Having a bodily approach to the teenagers’ ailments; (4) Giving teenagers a better understanding of their problems; (5) Making teenagers safer on their own borders; (6) Giving teenagers greater bodily security; and (7) Giving the teenagers increased self-confidence and increased ability to cope in social situations. The respondents had the following thoughts about the challenges psychomotor physiotherapy have when it comes to working with teenagers: (1) Little maturity and ability to reflect among teenagers; (2) High drop-out from the sessions; (3) Alliance-building (to establish confidence, to have patience and to “meet” teenagers); (4) To have a careful enough approach to the body; (5) To focus on coping rather than concentrating on their disability; (6) To collaborate with the teenagers’ parents; (7) To adapt the method to teenagers; and (8) That psychomotor physiotherapy is a little known treatment among potential partners. Conclusion: Psychomotor physiotherapy for teenagers has relatively low extensiveness. The characteristics of those who work mostly with teenagers (relative to the number of psychomotor physiotherapists) are: advanced age, long work experience and further education under the old scheme. Men work in relative terms more with teenagers than women do. Teenagers go to psychomotor physiotherapy because of both physical and mental ailments. Psychomotor physiotherapy can in many ways contribute to the teenagers’ ability to cope with their own lives, and it is relevant in mental health care. Psychomotor physiotherapy also has several challenges when it comes to working with teenagers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine how {{inclusion}} is being implemented in one primary school in Beirut (ABSS) and highlight how psychosocial and academic needs of students with Learning Difficulties (LD) are identified and catered for. The study addressed three research questions: How does the school insure awareness, coordination and needed skills for its LD program, how are students’ psychosocial and academic needs being addressed, and how is the curriculum being modified to meet students’ needs? In order to address the above questions, data was collected through an interview with the school’s special needs coordinator, online questionnaires administered to 11 parents of LD students and to 19 teachers (regular and support), observations, and artifacts. The researcher’s reflection journal was the starting point for the study and for formulating items for the instruments. The study followed a qualitative approach and a descriptive single case study design, where data was collected from multiple sources to ensure triangulated results and validity and reliability of findings. The results of the study showed that ABSS meets the criteria for a successful inclusive school, yet it needs to start using intervention books for LD students and recruit a <b>psychomotor</b> <b>therapist</b> so as to become more successful. The significance of this study is its value as a model for sister schools in implementing inclusion. N/A 1 hard copy: xi, 70 leaves; 31 cm. available at RNL. Bibliography : leaves 43 - 47...|$|E
40|$|Since it {{has been}} shown that spatial {{development}} can be delayed in blind children, focused sensorimotor trainings that associate auditory and motor information might be used to prevent the risk of spatial-related developmental delays or impairments from an early age. With this aim, we proposed a new technological device based on the implicit link between action and perception: ABBI (Audio Bracelet for Blind Interaction) is an audio bracelet that produces a sound when a movement occurs by allowing the substitution of the visuo-motor association with a new audio-motor association. In this study, we assessed the effects of an extensive but entertaining sensorimotor training with ABBI on the development of spatial hearing in a group of seven 3 – 5 years old children with congenital blindness (n = 2; light perception or no perception of light) or low vision (n = 5; visual acuity range 1. 1 – 1. 7 LogMAR). The training required the participants to play several spatial games individually and/or together with the <b>psychomotor</b> <b>therapist</b> 1 h per week for 3 months: the spatial games consisted of exercises meant to train their ability to associate visual and motor-related signals from their body, in order to foster the development of multisensory processes. We measured spatial performance by asking participants to indicate the position of one single fixed (static condition) or moving (dynamic condition) sound source on a vertical sensorized surface. We found that spatial performance of congenitally blind but not low vision children is improved after the training, indicating that early interventions with the use of science-driven devices based on multisensory capabilities can provide consistent advancements in therapeutic interventions, improving the quality of life of children with visual disability...|$|E
