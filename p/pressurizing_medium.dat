While simple in principle, this brings complications. Substantial pumping capacity is needed, since even the slight compressibility of water means that the pressurization stores non-trivial energy.

40|$|I {{will discuss}} several {{issues related to}} the acceleration, collimation, and {{propagation}} of jets from active galactic nuclei. Hydromagnetic stresses provide the best bet for both accelerating relativistic flows and providing a certain amount of initial collimation. However, there are limits to how much "self-collimation" can be achieved without the help of an external <b>pressurized</b> <b>medium.</b> Moreover, existing models, which postulate highly organized poloidal flux near the base of the flow, are probably unrealistic. Instead, a large fraction of the magnetic energy may reside in highly disorganized "chaotic" fields. Such a field can also accelerate the flow to relativistic speeds, in some cases with greater efficiency than highly organized fields, but at the expense of self-collimation. The observational interpretation of jet physics is still hampered by a dearth of unambiguous diagnostics.

40|$|The {{optimization}} of synthesis, {{design and}} operation in trigeneration systems for building applications is a quite complex task, {{due to the}} high number of decision variables, the presence of irregular heat, cooling and electric load profiles and the variable electricity price. Consequently, computer-aided techniques are usually adopted to achieve the optimal solution, based either on iterative techniques, linear or non-linear programming or evolutionary search. Large efforts have been made in improving algorithm efficiency, which have resulted in an increasingly rapid convergence to the optimal solution and in reduced calculation time; robust algorithm have also been formulated, assuming stochastic behaviour for energy loads and prices. This paper {{is based on the assumption}} that margins for improvements in the optimization of trigeneration systems still exist, which require an in-depth understanding of plant’s energetic behaviour.

40|$|Disk galaxies at high {{redshift}} (z~ 2) {{are characterized}} by high fractions of cold gas, strong turbulence, and giant star-forming clumps. Major mergers of disk galaxies at high redshift should then generally involve such turbulent clumpy disks. Merger simulations, however, model the ISM as a stable, homogeneous, and thermally <b>pressurized</b> <b>medium.</b> We present the first merger simulations with high fractions of cold, turbulent, and clumpy gas. We discuss the major new features of these models compared to models where the gas is artificially stabilized and warmed. Gas turbulence, which is already strong in high-redshift disks, is further enhanced in mergers. Some phases are dispersion-dominated, {{with most of the}} gas kinetic energy in the form of velocity dispersion and very chaotic velocity fields, unlike merger models using a thermally stabilized gas. These mergers can reach very high star formation rates, and have multi-component gas spectra consistent with SubMillimeter Galaxies. Major mergers with high fractions of cold turbulent gas are also characterized by highly dissipative gas collapse to the center of mass, with the stellar component following in a global contraction. The final galaxies are early-type with relatively small radii and high Sersic indices, like high-redshift compact spheroids. The mass fraction in a disk component that survives or re-forms after a merger is severely reduced compared to models with stabilized gas, and the formation of a massive disk component would require significant accretion of external baryons afterwards. Mergers thus appear to destroy extended disks even when the gas fraction is high, and this lends further support to smooth infall as the main formation mechanism for massive disk galaxies.

Measurements were made as a function of both composition and pressure. Acoustic damping rates were determined through model fits to the acquired signals. The results were compared with theoretical calculations using both classical acoustic damping rates and a more comprehensive model that includes the additional diffusive mechanisms associated with binary mixtures of gases with widely different molecular weights. For unmixed atomic species, the classical acoustic damping rate is known to accurately model the acoustic dissipation. However, in mixtures of atomic species, additional dissipation mechanisms appear which must be accounted for. Traditional acoustic damping rate measurements require the use of an ultrasonic acoustic source and a receiver which is located at various distances from the source. This traditional technique requires a homogeneous static mixture, as well as a physically large volume.

Further advantages of Pressurized Planar Electrochromatography include the ability to separate multiple samples simultaneously, separate samples that have been spotted in a two-dimensional array across the plate, and run separations on multiple plates simultaneously. ^ A prototype apparatus for performing Pressurized Planar Electrochormatography is described in this thesis, and was used to demonstrate that this technique is significantly faster and more efficient than classical Thin-Layer Chromatography. An example is shown in which a 24 -fold enhancement in the speed of separation is achieved with Pressurized Planar Electrochromatography. Reproducibility with this apparatus was poor, and several changes were made to the apparatus and operating procedure to improve this. The second prototype apparatus is described in detail in this thesis. ^ It was shown that the migration distance of neutral analytes increases with applied voltage, percent organic modifier, conditioning temperature, soak time, and buffer concentration, while migration distance decreases with applied pressure. ^ The highest efficiency in Pressurized Planar Electrochromatography is achieved at an intermediate temperature. This behavior is ascribed to high resistance to mass transfer at lower temperatures and increased diffusion at higher temperatures. Efficiency, as measured by the number of theoretical plates increases with increasing migration distance. Under appropriate conditions, efficiencies as high as 94, 000 plates per meter were achieved. This thesis also described the dependence of efficiency in Pressurized Planar Electrochromatography on the applied voltage (used as a surrogate for flow rate), and applied pressure, the temperature, and the buffer concentration and pH of the mobile phase. Results are presented as plots of the height equivalent of a theoretical plate versus applied voltage. With the exception of separations at 0 °C, the highest efficiency is observed at the highest applied voltage. ^ Desorption electrospray ionization is a new mass spectrometry method that allows analytes to be ionized directly from a TLC plate after PPEC.

40|$|PurposeUsing endothelial cell/smooth {{muscle cell}} (SMC) cocultures, we have {{demonstrated}} that pressurized endothelial cell coculture inhibits SMC proliferation and promotes apoptosis, and that this effect is transferable through <b>pressurized</b> endothelial <b>medium.</b> We now hypothesized that endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) {{plays a significant role}} in mediating these pressure-induced effects. MethodsConditioned media from endothelial cells and SMCs exposed to ambient and increased pressure were transferred to recipient SMCs. We counted cells after 5 days of incubation with these media and evaluated eNOS and inducible NOS (iNOS) levels by Western blot. ResultsConditioned media from pressurized endothelial cells significantly decreased recipient SMC counts. This effect was sustained when N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) was added to recipient cells but abolished when L-NAME was added to donor cells. SMCs were then exposed to control and pressurized conditions in monoculture or in coculture with endothelial cells. Pressure and coculture caused similar increase in iNOS levels but had no additive effect in combination. Finally, endothelial cells were exposed to control and pressurized environments. Pressure caused a 24 % ± 1. 6 % increase in eNOS protein (P =. 04, n = 12). This effect was sustained when cells were treated with L-NAME (32 % ± 1. 6 % increase, P =. 02) but abolished when endothelial cells were treated with calphostin C or PD 98059 to block protein kinase C (PKC) or extracellular regulated kinase (ERK). Pressure also increased endothelial phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) by 1. 8 -fold to 2. 6 -fold compared with control conditions after exposure of 2, 4, and 6 hours (P =. 02, n = 4). This increase was sustained after pretreatment with calphostin C. ConclusionPressure modulates endothelial cell effects on SMC growth by increasing eNOS in an ERK-dependent and PKC-dependent manner.

During the milking parlor inspections, feet were cleaned with a <b>medium</b> <b>pressurized</b> hose, and followed by visual observation of the rear feet in the milking parlor with a small mirror and a headlamp (see picture 1 and 2). During chute inspections, feet were lifted one by one, cleaned with paper towel and then scored. Scoring of the lesions was done according to a six point scoring system (M 0 -M 4. 1) which was adapted by Berry et al 2. from Döpfer et al. 19973. We calculated sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), kappa values and %agreement to compare the two observations. We found a Se of 0. 90 and Sp of 0. 87 for the detection of DD in the milking parlor. The kappa value after comparing the two diagnostic tests was 0. 76, which is considered to be satisfactory 4. The Se, Sp and kappa value for correctly classifying was lower than for detecting lesions and indicated that classifying is more difficult than just detecting.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{mechanical}} impedance on ethylene evolution {{and growth of}} preemergent maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings was investigated by <b>pressurizing</b> the growth <b>medium</b> in triaxial cells in a controlled environment. Pressure increased the bulk density of the medium and thus the resistance to growth. The elongation of maize primary roots and preemergent shoots was severely hindered by applied pressures as low as 10 kilopascals. Following a steep decline in elongation at low pressures, both shoots and roots responded to additional pressure in a linear manner, but shoots were more severely affected than roots at higher pressures. Radial expansion was promoted in both organs by mechanical impedance. Primary roots typically became thinner during the experimental period when grown unimpeded. In contrast, pressures as low as 25 kilopascals caused a 25 % increase in root tip diameter. Shoots showed a slight enhancement of radial expansion; however, in contrast to roots, the shoots increased in diameter even when growing unimpeded. Such morphological changes were not evident until at least 3 hours after initiation of treatment. All levels of applied pressure promoted ethylene evolution as early as 1 hour after application of pressure. After 1 hour, ethylene evolution rates had increased 10, 32, 70, and 255 % at 25, 50, 75, and 100 kilopascals respectively, and continued to increase linearly for at least 10 hours. When intact corn seedlings were subjected {{to a series of}} hourly cycles of pressure, followed by relaxation, ethylene production rates increased or decreased rapidly, illustrating tight coupling between mechanical impedance and tissue response. Seedlings exposed to 1 microliter of ethylene per liter showed symptoms similar to those shown by plants grown under mechanical impedance. Root diameter increased 5 times as much as the shoot diameter. Pretreatment with 10 micromolar aminoethoxyvinyl glycine plus 1 micromolar silver thiosulfate maintained ethylene production rates of impeded seedlings at basal levels and restored shoot and root extension to 84 and 90 % of unimpeded values, respectively.
