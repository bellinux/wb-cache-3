You will {{only be able to}} use the materials provided and you will have a limited time frame to complete the task. Each member of your group needs to participate in each step of the process. Points will be awarded each time a team correctly completes a stage in the process. If a team fails to correctly complete a step, they must redo that step. 1. The robotic arm can stand no taller than 24 ” before it is in its extended position 2. No more than 8 syringes may be used in the construction of the robotic arm 3. Your robotic arm must be able to rotate at least 90 ° from its original position 4. The size of the base of the robotic arm must not be altered in any way (supplied by teacher) 5. The syringe control panel must not be altered in any way (supplied by teacher) 6. Each group must submit a completed design packet before they can participate in the final competition When you meet as a team you should: •Review the problem. •Review the specifications. •Each team member should draw at least two thumbnail sketches of possible robot arm designs. •Meet as a group and review all of the thumbnail drawings from each of your team members • Select one final design and each team member needs to draw that design on the final design sheet. (The final design may be a combination of many designs) •HINT: Keep the design simple! Sometimes the best solution is the simplest one.
