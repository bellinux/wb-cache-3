5|$|Clarinet choir, which {{features}} {{a large number of}} clarinets <b>playing</b> <b>together,</b> usually involves a range of different members of the clarinet family (see Extended family of clarinets). The homogeneity of tone across the different members of the clarinet family produces an effect with some similarities to a human choir.|$|E
5|$|Tinker, Evers, and Chance began <b>playing</b> <b>together</b> {{with the}} Cubs in 1902, {{and formed a}} double play {{combination}} that lasted through April 1912. The Cubs won the National League pennant four times from 1906 and 1910 (and the 1907 and 1908 World Series), often defeating the Giants {{en route to the}} World Series.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally {{these terms}} are {{specific}} to certain geographical areas although some may be used by a particular social group such as pax in the UK, used primarily by children attending private schools.

The album Metallica was mostly recorded in Los Angeles at One on One Studios, between October 6, 1990 and June 16, 1991, although Ulrich, Hetfield, and Rock also recorded {{for a week}} in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada between April and May 1991. As {{the first to be}} produced by Bob Rock, it was recorded differently than previous Metallica albums; Rock suggested that the band members record in the studio while <b>playing</b> <b>together,</b> rather than separately.|$|E
5|$|Pacer is {{an album}} {{released}} in October 1995 by the Amps, Kim Deal's side project from her group the Breeders, {{who took a}} break from <b>playing</b> <b>together</b> beginning in late 1994. Deal recruited two new musicians and named the group the Amps. The band recorded Pacer at several studios in the USA and in Ireland, with different engineers each time, including Steve Albini, Bryce Goggin, and John Agnello.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Brand New's {{official}} formation, in {{the late}} 1990s, Jesse Lacey, Garrett Tierney and Brian Lane were {{all members of the}} post-hardcore band The Rookie Lot, along with Brandon Reilly and Alex Dunne of Crime in Stereo. After the band's split and not <b>playing</b> <b>together</b> for a while, Lacey, Lane and Tierney started to rehearse again. After Reilly joined The Movielife, they then recruited guitarist Vincent Accardi, who had been playing in a band called One Last Goodbye.|$|E
5000|$|In {{subsequent}} years, various triumvirates {{have been}} dubbed the new trinity, including Ryan Giggs-Paul Scholes-Gary Neville, who <b>played</b> <b>together</b> between 1992 and 2011, Cristiano Ronaldo-Wayne Rooney-Carlos Tevez, who <b>played</b> <b>together</b> at United between 2007 and 2009, [...] and Wayne Rooney-Robin van Persie-Juan Mata, who have <b>played</b> <b>together</b> since Mata signed for United in January 2014 until Van Persie's departure in July 2015.|$|R

5|$|Fat Freddy's Drop {{returned}} to touring New Zealand, Australia and Europe {{to promote the}} new album in 2009. Three shows {{on the west coast}} of the United States, and a show in Canada, were also included in the tour. The only previous time the band had played in the United States was a single performance at the Detroit Electronic Music festival in 2004. Before 2009, the cost of touring in the US, difficulty obtaining visas, and the band's low profile in North America prevented them from including tour dates there. Band members say they now consider <b>playing</b> <b>together</b> as Fat Freddy's Drop their first musical priority, and spend less time playing with other bands.|$|E
5|$|Miller and {{his family}} moved to Palmer Township, Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania in 1989. In that year he joined three other pianists in {{recording}} a CD tribute to Memphis pianist Phineas Newborn, Jr. This group, the Contemporary Piano Ensemble, performed intermittently until 1996, often <b>playing</b> <b>together</b> on four separate pianos. In 1990, Miller traveled to the Soviet Union to appear as pianist in Golson's band at the first Moscow International Jazz Festival. In 1992 Miller also toured domestically and internationally with the New York Jazz Giants, a septet containing Jon Faddis, Tom Harrell, Lew Tabackin, Bobby Watson, Ray Drummond, and Carl Allen. Miller continued to accompany vocalists, including on recordings with Dianne Reeves and Cassandra Wilson. Starting in 1993, he also played and recorded with saxophonist Joe Lovano.|$|E
5|$|Minehead Barbarians, the town's rugby club, {{have been}} <b>playing</b> <b>together</b> since the 1930s, {{but the main}} local {{football}} club, Minehead A.F.C., is even older, founded in 1889.

50|$|By {{the time}} that the album was produced, the members of Pentangle were already {{accomplished}} musicians, in their own fields, and had <b>played</b> <b>together</b> in various combinations. Jansch and Renbourn were recognised as solo artists and <b>played</b> <b>together</b> regularly, including their recording of the Bert And John album. McShee had sung folk and blues in pubs and clubs, and had recorded with Renbourn on Another Monday. Cox and Thompson were experienced session musicians and had <b>played</b> <b>together</b> in Alexis Korner's band.|$|R
5|$|The {{band members}} {{subsequently}} focused on solo projects, and Ray and Dave released their own studio albums. Talk of a Kinks reunion circulated (including an aborted studio reunion {{of the original}} band members in 1999), but neither Ray nor Dave Davies showed much interest in <b>playing</b> <b>together</b> again. Meanwhile, former members John Gosling, John Dalton and Mick Avory had regrouped in 1994 and started performing on the oldies circuit along with guitar-player/singer Dave Clarke as the Kast Off Kinks. Gosling and Dalton retired in 2008 and were replaced in the band by former Kinks members Jim Rodford and Ian Gibbons. Ray Davies, Pete Quaife and Bob Henrit have occasionally made guest appearances with the group at Kinks fan club conventions.|$|E
5|$|Graham's {{replacement}} was Glaswegian John Docherty. In {{his second}} season as manager, Millwall won the Second Division championship and gained promotion to the top flight of English football {{for the first time}} in the club's history. Starting the 1988–89 season strongly, Millwall topped the league on 1 October 1988 having played six games (winning four and drawing two) and rarely slipped out of the top five before Christmas. This was mainly due to Tony Cascarino and Teddy Sheringham, who scored 99 goals between them in three seasons <b>playing</b> <b>together.</b> Millwall's first top division season ended with a tenth-place finish, which was the lowest place occupied by the club all season. The following season, they briefly led the league for one night in September 1989 after beating Coventry City 4–1, but won only two more games all season and were relegated in 20th place at the end of the 1989–90 season.|$|E
5|$|In April 2002, {{the band}} {{discarded}} the recordings {{and took a}} break. The members then each started individual projects: Grohl became the full-time Queens of the Stone Age drummer for a tour, Shiflett started the Viva Death and Jackson projects with his brother Scott and rejoined his former band Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, Hawkins played with Jane's Addiction bassist Eric Avery, and Mendel both played with Juno and reunited with his former bandmate William Goldsmith in The Fire Theft. Later on April, they reunited for the Foo Fighters' scheduled concert at the 2002 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, which Grohl felt could be the last the band would perform. During the rehearsals, the tensions broke out in huge fights, especially between Grohl and Hawkins. The musicians decided to at least perform in Coachella before deciding whether to continue <b>playing</b> <b>together</b> or end the band. After enjoying their performance, the bandmembers decided to remain united and returned to re-recording the album.|$|E
50|$|Coltrane {{studied with}} Coleman, and they {{frequently}} <b>played</b> <b>together</b> but never produced a formal recording. The Avant-garde album {{is a result}} of their mutual respect and friendship. Coltrane, Coleman, and Cherry all <b>played</b> <b>together</b> in ensembles as they explored a new dimension in jazz.|$|R
50|$|His {{older brother}} John also played for Zimbabwe and in 1996-97 against Pakistan, history was made {{when the two}} <b>played</b> <b>together</b> along with the Strang and Flower {{brothers}}. It {{was the first time}} that 3 sets of brothers had <b>played</b> <b>together</b> in a game.|$|R
50|$|Live at NEARFest is a live album by Strawbs. It was {{recorded}} at NEARFest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on July 11 2004 and featured the line-up which <b>played</b> <b>together</b> on the albums Hero and Heroine and Ghosts. This line-up had not <b>played</b> <b>together</b> since 1975.|$|R
5|$|Jardine's tactics were {{successful}} in one respect: in six innings against the tourists ahead of the Tests, Bradman scored only 103 runs, causing concern among the Australian public who expected much more from him. At the time, Bradman was in dispute with the Board of Control, who would not allow players to write in newspapers unless journalism was their full-time profession; Bradman, although not a journalist, had a contract to write for the Sydney Sun. A particular irritation for Bradman was that Jack Fingleton, a full-time journalist, was allowed to write for the Telegraph Pictorial, although he required permission from the Board to write about cricket. Bradman threatened {{to withdraw from the}} team unless the Board allowed him to write. Fingleton and Bradman were openly hostile towards each other. From their first meeting while <b>playing</b> <b>together</b> for New South Wales, they disliked each other. Fingleton, conscious that Bradman's self-possession and solitary nature made him unpopular with some teammates, kept his distance after a dressing room argument, while Bradman believed the more popular Fingleton had tried to turn the team against him. Later hostility arose from Bradman's public preference for Bill Brown as a batsman, which Fingleton believed cost him a place on the 1934 tour of England. Fingleton's writings on the Bodyline series further soured the relationship. Bradman believed some of the differences stemmed from religion; Fingleton was a Roman Catholic, Bradman an Anglican.|$|E
5|$|The Knapps {{study in}} Monroe County, Indiana, found {{time-out}} and {{times to be}} {{by far the most}} prevalent terms in the 1970s. Variations included I've got times and time. Very few children reported the more traditional kings, queens or I've got kings X. The authors also reported that these terms were popular over many areas of the US and in American schools abroad. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of the children <b>playing</b> <b>together.</b> Time-out clearly derives from the use of intermissions in timed sports and apparently came into the language with the popularization of organized or timed sports and with the advent of such sports in elementary schools and on television. Historically the earliest reports for the use of time-out or time as a truce term were 1935 and 1936. However, {{only a small number of}} respondents reported anything other than time-out and its derivatives in use during the 1960s. The few alternatives included pax, safe, base or home-base and freeze with one small area of fins (Mount Vernon). The Knapps reported that time-out had, since the 1950s, supplanted kings ex as the most popular truce term.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the band}} left the {{possibility}} of <b>playing</b> <b>together</b> again open, rumors and speculation frequently circulated that a reunion was inevitable. The hiatus of Joe Gittleman's band, Avoid One Thing, fueled further speculation of such a reunion.|$|E
