25|$|From 1665–1794, a site on Pinfold Street in Howden {{was used}} as a lodging house for the needy. A workhouse was then opened on the site which {{included}} a manufactory, stone-breaking yard, cowshed and prison. A <b>parliamentary</b> <b>report</b> of 1776 listed the parish workhouse at Howden as being able to accommodate up to 20 inmates.|$|E
25|$|Previously a three tier system, Belgian law {{enforcement}} now {{consists of two}} police forces operating on a federal and local level. While the two services remain independent, they integrate for purposes of recruitment and common training. This structural reform occurred in 2001 following a national <b>parliamentary</b> <b>report</b> {{into a series of}} paedophile murders which proved police negligence and severely diminished public confidence. Currently, approximately 33,000 local police and 900 civilians work across 196 regional police forces.|$|E

25|$|With {{the many}} gunmakers and {{workshops}} {{the quality of}} gun manufacture in the town needed to be controlled. Government viewing rooms were opened in Bagot Street in 1798, employing sixty or seventy people to ensure that guns produced were of the necessary standard {{to provide for the}} British army. Military use, however, was accompanied by a major market in the Atlantic slave trade. A 1788 <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>report</b> counted over 4,000 gun makers, with 100,000 guns a year going to slave traders.|$|E
25|$|In September 2004, the World Health Organization {{estimated}} {{that there had been}} 50,000 deaths in Darfur {{since the beginning of the}} conflict, an 18-month period, mostly due to starvation. An updated estimate the following month put the number of deaths for the 6-month period from March to October 2004 due to starvation and disease at 70,000; These figures were criticized, because they only considered short periods and did not include deaths from violence. A more recent British <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Report</b> {{estimated that}} over 300,000 people had died, and others have estimated even more.|$|E
25|$|In Norway in 2004, only Rieber {{worked with}} {{sealskin}} and seal oil. In 2001, the biggest producer of raw seal oil was Canada (two {{percent of the}} raw oil was processed and sold in Canadian health stores). Rieber had the majority of all distribution of raw seal oil in the world market, {{but there was no}} demand for seal oil. From 1995 to 2005, Rieber annually received between 2 and 3 million Norwegian krone in subsidy. A 2003–2004 <b>parliamentary</b> <b>report</b> says CG Rieber Skinn is the only company in the world that delivers skin from bluebacks. Most of the skins processed by Rieber have been imported from abroad, mainly from Canada. Only a small portion is from the Norwegian hunt. Of the processed skin, five percent is sold in Norway; the rest is exported to the Russian and Asian markets.|$|E

25|$|In December 1971 the Eastern Railway Construction Act 1971 {{was passed}} by the state parliament, setting the route as along the Eastern Freeway to Thompsons Road, then through Templestowe to Blackburn Road, Doncaster, {{involving}} the demolition of 30 houses. However this route was not without opposition, as in 1972 The Herald reported that the outer section of the line would be investigated by the Parliamentary Public Works Committee. The City of Box Hill rejected a plan put forward by the City of Doncaster & Templestowe as it would cut into open space along Koonung Creek, and Doncaster residents objected to a route running though the Eastern Golf Course to Blackburn Road. In December 1972 the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>report</b> was delivered and recommended the original route to be constructed as opposed to the 6 alternatives, and criticised the government for allowing development on the proposed routes. The outer section of the line was estimated to be $23.5 million, the total cost of the line being reported as $41 million. A terminus-to-city travel time of 20–25 minutes was expected.|$|E
25|$|In East Germany, {{the head}} of the central {{pharmacy}} control commission, Friedrich Jung, suspected an antivitaminic effect of thalidomide as derivative of glutamic acid. Meanwhile, in West Germany, it took some time before the increase in dysmelia {{at the end of the}} 1950s was connected with thalidomide. In 1958 Karl Beck, a former pediatric doctor in Bayreuth wrote an article in a local newspaper claiming a relationship between nuclear weapons testing and cases of dysmelia in children. Based on this, FDP whip Erich Mende requested an official statement from the federal government. For statistical reasons, the main data series used to research dysmelia cases started by chance at the same time as the approval date for thalidomide. After the Nazi regime with its Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring used mandatory statistical monitoring to commit various crimes, western Germany had been very reluctant to monitor congenital disorders in a similarly strict way. The <b>parliamentary</b> <b>report</b> rejected any relation with radioactivity and the abnormal increase of dysmelia. Also the DFG research project installed after the Mende request was not helpful. The project was led by pathologist Franz Büchner who ran the project to propagate his teratological theory. Büchner saw lack of healthy nutrition and behavior of the mothers as being more important than genetic reasons. Furthermore, it took a while to install a Surgeon General in Germany; the Federal Ministry of Health (Germany) was not founded until 1962, some months after thalidomide was banned from the market. In Germany approximately 2,500 thalidomide babies were born.|$|E
500|$|Although the Royal Prerogative is {{extensive}} and parliamentary approval is not formally required for its exercise, it is limited. Many Crown prerogatives have {{fallen out of}} use or have been permanently transferred to Parliament. For example, the monarch cannot impose and collect new taxes; such an action requires the authorisation of an Act of Parliament. According to a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>report,</b> [...] "The Crown cannot invent new prerogative powers", and Parliament can override any prerogative power by passing legislation.|$|E
40|$|Building on {{research}} by David Erdman, this essay seeks to re-examine Coleridge’s <b>parliamentary</b> <b>reports</b> of 1800 {{within the context}} of contemporary reporting practices. A comparison of Coleridge’s accounts of his trips to the House of Commons with standard accounts of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>reporting</b> and its norms shows that Coleridge was given special license by the editor of the Morning Post, Daniel Stuart. While David Erdman focused on the length and accuracy of the reports as a basis for his claim that Coleridge was a superior parliamentary correspondent, this essay argues that it is the space granted to Coleridge’s reports in the Morning Post and the freedom he was afforded as a journalist that demonstrates the importance of his contributions to parliamentary coverage...|$|R

500|$|In 1989, {{there were}} 18assemblies {{belonging}} to the Evangelical Missionary Federation. In 1995 the church (then widely established in several French regions) was called [...] "a big regional cult that has now spread throughout eastern France" [...] by the CCMM. The following year, the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>report</b> of the National Assembly listed 24places of worship; the church stated the list was incomplete and incorrect as three places were missed, and eight belonged to other churches. Before it was dissolved in 2006, the federation counted 35churches.|$|E
500|$|In February 1843 the Second Report of the Children's Employment Commission was published. It was a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>report</b> {{exposing the}} effects of the Industrial Revolution upon working class children. Horrified by what he read, Dickens planned to publish an {{inexpensive}} political pamphlet tentatively titled, An Appeal to the People of England, on behalf of the Poor Man's Child, but changed his mind, deferring the pamphlet's production {{until the end of the}} year. In March he wrote to Dr. Southwood Smith, one of the four commissioners responsible for the Second Report, about his change in plans: [...] "you will certainly feel that a Sledge hammer has come down with twenty times the force—twenty thousand times the force—I could exert by following out my first idea".|$|E
500|$|Although it {{does not}} refer {{directly}} to the Gospel, Antoinism is often considered a Christian based new religious movement. In 1970, British sociologist Bryan Wilson classified Antoinism {{in the category of}} [...] "thaumaturgical sects". Secretary of the French episcopate for the study of cults and new religious movements Jean Vernette also deemed the group a [...] "healer church" [...] and [...] "a new religion of Spiritism, Theosophy and elements of Christianity". Le Protestant Liégeois, a Belgian Protestant periodical, said that the group, although listed as a cult in the 1995 <b>parliamentary</b> <b>report,</b> was [...] "rather a philosophical and religious movement". In an encyclopedia about sects, the journalist Xavier Pasquini qualified Antoinism a [...] "genuine Theosophical religion", and stated that it [...] "does not ask for money from its followers, and does not practice excessive indoctrination".|$|E

500|$|Before 1988, {{the church}} {{was the subject of}} many neutral press {{articles}} and appeared [...] "normal and respectable"; it contends that in the late 1980s Alain Vivien, then-leader of the CCMM, said to its representatives in Épernay that he did not consider it a cult. The church explained that the first criticism came from a Catholic vice-president of CCMM, who opposed the conversion to the Pentecostal church of his son-in-law and several seminarians (this explanation was later denied by the CCMM), by an educator hostile to the group, and by other evangelicals (including pastor and co-founder of the anti-cult group Vigi-sectes Gérard Dagon, a source for the 1995 <b>parliamentary</b> <b>report</b> who was critical of Pentecostal beliefs). The church also reported discriminations after the publication of the report (including refusals of building permits) and to have spent, over a period of ten years, €82,000 in legal fees to defend its interests. In 2003, the church participated in a survey led by CESNUR about a possible change in government policy towards new religious movements.|$|E
500|$|The French Parliamentary Commission on Cults {{included}} {{the church in}} the list of cults of the 1995 and 1999 parliamentary reports, based on reports by the Direction centrale des renseignements généraux that labelled the church as an [...] "evangelical" [...] and [...] "healer" [...] movement. Despite their similarities, other churches associated with the Evangelical Missionary Federation {{were not included in the}} list. The 1995 report said the group was among the [...] "most active evangelical groups" [...] and the Parliamentary Commission said they are [...] "often motivated by genuine pastors who slid into the role of guru" [...] and [...] "always benefit from freedoms by Protestant official structures to prosper at their edge." [...] However, the parliamentary reports and the list of cults had no legal status and were criticized by religious historians, sociologists and academics. In May2007, a circular by Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin and a statement by MIVILUDES secretary Gilles Bottine, said the list of movements attached to the 1995 <b>parliamentary</b> <b>report</b> had become less relevant and no longer recommended its use.|$|E
500|$|Simple and brief, {{services}} are {{performed in the}} temples, generally twice per day, and are composed of two forms of worship: [...] "The General Operation", which consists of the transmission of the fluid to the churchgoers, and [...] "The Reading" [...] of Antoine's writings. Members who performed the services wear an entirely black dress, as sign of an intense involvement in the religion; they are not paid. Temples are also the place of consultations of a healer by people who wish to obtain a request, frequently related to health. Antoinist celebrations include Christian holidays and other three days that commemorate the founding couple and {{the dedication of the}} first temple. Registered as organism of public utility in Belgium and as religious association in France, the religion is directed by a college composed of the most active members called desservants. It is financed by anonymous donations and do not ask for money from its followers. In France, the cult classification of Antoinism in the 1995 <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Report</b> was criticized by the sociologists who studied the religious group, and many people involved in the anti-cults fight did not report cultic deviances.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1970s and 1980s, an {{increasing}} number of new religious movements have become active in France.
