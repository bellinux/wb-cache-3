50|$|A {{commonly}} used deposition method for multilayer structures is magnetron sputtering. A multilayer system consists {{of thousands of}} thin single layers of the component combination that are alternately sputtered on the substrate surface. For electroplating or electrochemical deposition (ECD) multilayer deposition two approaches are established. On the one hand a two bath method exist, which means an alternating deposition in two different plating baths. On the other hand, a one bath method, with an electrolyte containing both film components in one bath, can be used. The ECD process reduces process time and complexity. In addition, this method enables <b>pattern</b> <b>plating</b> to prevent complex etching process of structures.|$|E

40|$|An {{electrochemical}} {{approach to}} decreasing {{high levels of}} total organic carbon (TOC) in printed circuit board (PCB) copper sulfate plating baths has been investigated. The organic contaminants build-up {{over the course of}} <b>pattern</b> <b>plating</b> of PCBs, and at high concentrations they interfere with the quality of the plated copper. The electrochemical approach involves destroying the organic contaminants using electrochemical oxidation. Various anode materials (glassy carbon, lead, lead dioxide, platinum, iridium dioxide and doped tin dioxide) were screened for this application. Some corrosion data is presented for these anodes and their performance for TOC removal at various current densities has been roughly quantified using an apparent first order rate constant. The three best performing anode materials gave increasing oxidation rates going from platinum to doped tin dioxide to lead dioxide, unfortunately anode stability decreased in the same order.

40|$|The current paper {{presents}} {{fabrication of}} wet etching based comb-type microaccelerometer structure consisting of 47 interdigitated fingers {{attached to a}} large proof mass, which is suspended by two narrow torsional beams. Silicon (, p-type) was oxidized and the microaccelerometer structure was patterned by photolithography. Desired device thickness was achieved by combination of wet anisotropic etching of 15 μm depth and formation of 12 μm thick p++ etch stop layer. Pits of 15 μm were formed in Pyrex glass and metallic lines with bonding pads were formed by UHV Ti-Au metallization and <b>pattern</b> <b>plating</b> (Au). Patterned glass and silicon wafers were aligned and anodically bonded; whereas, the metallic lines and the microaccelerometer anchors are eutectically bonded. Finally, the suspended comb-type device structure consisting of two torsional beams of 5 μm width and interdigitated comb fingers of 10 μm width is achieved by Dissolve Wafer Process (DWP).

40|$|Technologies for the 3 D {{integration}} {{are described}} within this paper {{with respect to}} devices that have to retain a specific minimum wafer thickness for handling purposes (CMOS) and integrity of mechanical elements (MEMS). This implies Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) with large dimensions and high aspect ratios (HAR). Moreover, as a main objective, the aspired TSV technology had to be universal and scalable with the designated utilization in a MEMS/CMOS foundry. Two TSV approaches are investigated and discussed, in which the TSVs were fabricated either before or after wafer thinning. One distinctive feature is an incomplete TSV Cu-filling, which avoids long processing and complex process control, while minimizing the thermomechanical stress between Cu and Si and related adverse effects in the device. However, the incomplete filling also includes various challenges regarding process integration. A method based on <b>pattern</b> <b>plating</b> is described, in which TSVs are metalized {{at the same time}} as the redistribution layer and which eliminates the need for additional planarization and patterning steps. For MEMS, the realization of a protective hermetically sealed capping is crucial, which is addressed in this paper by glass frit wafer level bonding and is discussed for hermetic sealing of MEMS inertial sensors. The TSV based 3 D integration technologies are demonstrated on CMOS like test vehicle and on a MEMS device fabricated in Air Gap Insulated Microstructure (AIM) technology...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{studied the}} {{deformation}} {{of a series}} of gold/polysilicon <b>patterned</b> <b>plate</b> microstructures fabricated by surface micromachining. The <b>patterned</b> <b>plate</b> microstructures were subjected to a uniform temperature change from 100 °C to room temperature that was intended to induce linear and geometrically nonlinear deformation. We used interferometry to measure full-field deformed shapes of the microstructures. From these measurements we determined the spatially-averaged curvature of the deformed microstructures within individual lines and across the entire plate. The deformation response of the <b>patterned</b> <b>plates</b> can be broadly characterized in terms of the average curvature as a function of temperature change and exhibits linear and geometrically nonlinear behavior. We modeled the deformation response of the <b>patterned</b> <b>plates</b> using geometrically nonlinear plate theory with the finite element method. Good agreement was obtained between predictions and measurements for both local curvature variations across lines and for the evolution of curvature of the entire plate with temperature change. Using a generalized plane strain approach with the finite element method we also modeled the spatial dependence of the stress distribution in the lines and substrate. For thick plates, our results agree with those of previous studies, showing a decrease in the von Mises stress in the metal lines with decreasing linewidth. For thinner substrates, though, we find the behavior with linewidth is opposite and there is a critical substrate thickness (about 10 μm for the system in our study) where the behavior with linewidth changes. These results have important implications in the design of patterned structures for micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) applications where films are of comparable thickness to the underlying substrate...|$|R

Foil types include fine grain copper, double treat copper, reverse treated foil, vendor copper, and electroless copper surfaces. Surface preparation methods include alumina jet cleaning, pumice scrubbing, brush cleaning, and chemical cleaning. Surfaces are characterized by contact profilometry, off-contact optical profilometry, Optically Stimulated Electron Emission (OSEE), and water break test. Evaluation criteria are instant adhesion (tape test), P/E minimum line and space resolution, minimum isolated line held, and (AOI) yields on a 75 micron test <b>pattern.</b> Furthermore, <b>pattern</b> <b>plate</b> performance is judged by degree of underplating, minimum developed space, and resolution.

40|$|We propose two novel {{experiments}} on {{the measurement of}} the Casimir force acting between a gold coated sphere and semiconductor plates with markedly different charge carrier densities. In {{the first of these}} experiments a <b>patterned</b> Si <b>plate</b> is used which consists of two sections of different dopant densities and oscillates in the horizontal direction below a sphere. The measurement scheme in this experiment is differential, i. e., allows the direct high-precision measurement of the difference of the Casimir forces between the sphere and sections of the <b>patterned</b> <b>plate</b> or the difference of the equivalent pressures between Au and <b>patterned</b> parallel <b>plates</b> with static and dynamic techniques, respectively. The second experiment proposes to measure the Casimir force between the same sphere and a VO${}_ 2 $ film which undergoes the insulator-metal phase transition with the increase of temperature. We report the present status of the interferometer based variable temperature apparatus developed to perform both experiments and present the first results on the calibration and sensitivity. The magnitudes of the Casimir forces and pressures in the experimental configurations are calculated using different theoretical approaches to the description of optical and conductivity properties of semiconductors at low frequencies proposed in the literature. It is shown that the suggested experiments will aid in the resolution of theoretical problems arising in the application of the Lifshitz theory at nonzero temperature to real materials. They will also open new opportunities in nanotechnology. Comment: 23 pages of the text, 2 tables, and captions of 12 figures (to appear in Phys. Rev. A...|$|R
