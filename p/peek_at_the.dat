500|$|Upon its release, {{the video}} {{received}} mixed response from critics. Aaron-Spencer Charles writing for Metro praised the video for being shot as a [...] "mini-drama, {{as we see}} Bruno Mars' relationship woes unfold". Spins William Goodman felt the clip was [...] "as dramatic as the blockbuster vampire films themselves." [...] However, he condemn it for only having the drama {{and a couple of}} scenes from the Twilight movie in common. Goodman described the music video as a [...] "soap opera tale of a young couple struggling through a breakup, and revisiting all their good times in the process." [...] David Greenwald of Billboard criticized the video for looking [...] "more like a denim brand's lookbook than a <b>peek</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> vampire franchise's fourth film." [...] At the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards Japan, the video was nominated in the categories of Best Male Video and Best Video from a Film, winning the former.|$|E
500|$|Matt Zoller Seitz of Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film four stars out of four, saying it [...] "is true {{to the spirit}} of [...] and matches its tone. But it never seems content to turn over old ground." [...] Trevor Johnston of Time Out gave the film four stars out of five, writing [...] "It has enough of the right stuff to haunt the {{imagination}} long after the immediate buzz of its fluffy-furred cuteness has melted away. For a mere prequel, that's a result." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three stars out of four and said it [...] "is cute, and funny, and the animation, though not exactly inspired, is certainly colorful." [...] Jake Coyle of Associated Press gave the film three stars out of four, saying it [...] "might not be as gifted as some of its other movies, but sometimes it's alright to be OK." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three stars out of four, and said [...] "It's all infectious fun, despite the lack of originality. In the art of tickling funny bones, Crystal and Goodman earn straight A's." [...] Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "This minor film with major charms still deserves to have kids dragging their parents to the multiplex for one more <b>peek</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> monsters in the closet. With Pixar, familiarity breeds content." [...] Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of five and said it is [...] "one of those movies that has absolutely no reason to exist, but once you've seen it, you're kind of glad it does." [...] Alan Scherstuhl of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Monsters University feels not like the work of artists eager to express something but like that of likable pros whose existence depends on getting a rise out the kids. It's like the scares Sully and Mike spring on those sleeping tykes: technically impressive but a job un-anchored to anything more meaningful." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 2, 2010, {{the first}} sneak <b>peek</b> <b>at</b> <b>The</b> Book of Air, {{including}} two artworks [...] "Airship" [...] and [...] "Streets of Wish", was revealed {{on the official}} PlayFirst's blog, Inside PlayFirst. Art director at the developer KatGames, Pablo Vietto, explained the ideas behind [...] "Airship" [...] artwork that KatGames {{wanted to make a}} [...] "very rustic and compact interior where they could place everything necessary for the navigation of the airship." [...] The artistic inspiration came from the old machines designed by Da Vinci and used in the Jules Verne stories, but adapted to their own style. Meanwhile, adding comments about [...] "Streets of Wish" [...] artwork, Vietto expressed that he wanted to [...] "keep the essence of the Wish village from the first Dream , respecting the roofs and cupules in green tonalities." [...] The idea of having a house with a cupule for a roof was in his mind since the first Dream Chronicles, so this was the perfect opportunity to use it again. According to Vietto, some other details, like the iron works and lights, were inspired by works done by Hector Guimard, a French architect {{and one of the most}} important ones during Modernism.|$|E

6000|$|Like bees {{swarming}} {{after their}} queen, mother and daughters hovered about Mr. March the next day, neglecting everything to look at, wait upon, {{and listen to}} the new invalid, who was in a fair way to be killed by kindness. As he sat propped up in a big chair by Beth's sofa, with the other three close by, and Hannah popping in her head now and then 'to <b>peek</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dear man', nothing seemed needed to complete their happiness. But something was needed, and the elder ones felt it, though none confessed the fact. Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one another with an anxious expression, as their eyes followed Meg. Jo had sudden fits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke's umbrella, which had been left in the hall. Meg was absent-minded, shy, and silent, started when the bell rang, and colored when John's name was mentioned. Amy said, [...] "Everyone seemed waiting for something, and couldn't settle down, which was queer, since Father was safe at home," [...] and Beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn't run over as usual.|$|E
