5000|$|Kirks' ginger Ale was {{originally}} sold by Owen Gardner & Sons {{before the company}} was merged with the Helidon Spa Water Company to become [...] "kirk's" [...] in 1959. Before the 2000 merger under Coca-Cola Amatil, Kirks sold its creaming soda under the name [...] "Kandy". Fruita and Sno Drop were originally products of Halls, whereas Kole Beer was produced by Gest. The brand's [...] "Old Stoney" [...] ginger beer originates {{its name from the}} stone <b>pottery</b> <b>bottles</b> that non-alcoholic ginger beer was sold in during the 1800s.|$|R
50|$|It was the mother's duty to breast-feed her children, but wet {{nurses were}} employed, and <b>pottery</b> feeding <b>bottles</b> are also known. There is {{evidence}} from vase paintings for cradles of wickerwork or wood. From the 4th century BCE children appear {{much more in}} artistic representations. Children played a number of games, and evidence of toys comes from literature, vase paintings and surviving examples of the actual toys.|$|R
25|$|Most of the {{artefacts}} recovered are of 19th-century origin. These include {{white and}} brown glazed <b>pottery,</b> stoneware, <b>bottle</b> and window glass, porcelain figurines, clay pipes and roof slates. More unusual finds include beads, buttons, burnt bone, lead toy soldiers, medieval green-glaze pottery and flint. Most {{of these items}} would probably {{have come from the}} night soil deposited on the midden and then spread with the manure from the farmyard midden.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with their}} competitors, Ladds used {{many kinds of}} bottles over the years, {{including}} various [...] "stonie" [...] <b>pottery</b> <b>bottles,</b> and in glass the Codd pattern (with the internal glass ball seal), Barrett or Riley pattern (with a Vulcanite [...] "screw-top" [...] threaded stopper) in the 26 imp fl oz bottle and, from around 1930, crown seal types. Bottles remained {{the property of the}} drink manufacturer, and if undamaged could be steam-cleaned and re-used over and over again. Mrs. Ladd purchased second-hand bottles from dealers ("marine store collectors") and instructed her bottle-washers and fillers to use all bottles, no matter what the brand. This was against the rules of the Aerated Waters and Cordial Makers' Employés' Union, (It was some 20 years before the manufacturers had a similar agreement) and the men refused to do so, and threatened strike action if forced to disobey Union Rules. Mrs. Ladd's motives were financial: she purchased secondhand bottles for 8d. per dozen, whereas new bottles cost 36s. per gross (3s. per dozen). In today's money that would be around $5.00 v. $22.00 per dozen.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, {{in advance}} of the {{redevelopment}} of the site of Castlemilk House into an adventure playground, an archaeological dig was carried out by Archaeology Projects Glasgow in close collaboration with the now defunct Castlemilk Local History Group.Two trial trenches {{to the west of the}} tower discovered a defensive ditch which had been filled with midden material such as <b>pottery,</b> bone, <b>bottle</b> glass and a clay pipe bowl that would date the deposit to the 18th century if not earlier.The remains of a stone structure which could have been a possible bridge was also uncovered running across the line of the ditch. Other trial trenches produced very little of interest.|$|R
5000|$|Like other Assyrian capitals, Assur {{was greatly}} {{destroyed}} during the {{battles of the}} century before. The importance of the city thereafter is not clear, but much evidence indicate it was a flourishing city during the Achaemenid rule. After the Babylonian conquest by Cyrus the Great, the [...] "Cyrus Cylinder" [...] mentions Assur {{as one of the}} cities of which cult statues were returned.In 401 BC, Xenephon describes the city as A large and prosperous city named [...] "Caenae" [...] (Assur) which was seen on the opposite (west) bank of the Tigris River. From this city, the barbarians (Assyrians) brought over loaves, cheeses and wine, crossing upon rafts made of skins. At the Assur Temple, two shrines have been identified as being built between the fifth and third centuries BC. A few graves at the site also may have been belonged to the Achaemenid period. From the grave site, a pair of circular earrings with globules has clearly been identified as Achaemenid. These earrings are similar to the silver earring found at Dur-Sharrukin near Nineveh. In another grave, Haller dates grave number 811 as Achaemenid period. The grave contained three bodies, a stamp-seal showing the goddess Ishtar standing {{on the back of a}} lion. This might indicate that ancient Mesopotamian religion was still being practiced within the Assyrian population during the Achaemenid rule. Other objects from the grave 811 include a bronze fibula; another earring, but gold rather than the earlier described silver; different kinds of beads of silver, agate, frit and glass; an alabastron; a bowl made of copper; and two <b>pottery</b> <b>bottles.</b> It is not clear, however, if all the items are Achaemenid in date.|$|R
5000|$|The museum {{includes}} {{a collection of}} oil lamps that date {{back as far as}} the Bronze Age [...] This collection shows the evolution of the lamp and includes newer versions dating from the Iron Age and Medieval times. Other everyday items held by the museum include hand tools, scrapers, <b>pottery,</b> arrowheads, tear <b>bottles,</b> cups (including a kylix), perfume bottles, coins, and clay tablet writings. These pieces demonstrate what life was like in antiquity in Egypt, Greece, Palestine, and Mesopotamia.|$|R
50|$|The Merovingian dynasty is {{considered}} to have begun in the year 481 and lasted until they were succeeded by the Carolingians in the 750s. Quentovic may have been established in the final decade of the 5th century, although {{it is more likely}} that it came into existence in the early 6th century. The earliest minted coins from Quentovic date from the 6th century. The reason for the town’s creation likely had to do with a need by the Franks to increase their long-distance trade. The location of the port of Quentovic was also ideal for controlling the frontiers of the recently solidified empire. This location would help to prevent luxury goods from being monopolized by certain aristocrats. In its early years, Quentovic was probably just a simple fairground where trading occurred, as well as a place where merchants went to and from Kent in Anglo-Saxon England. Merchants located in Quentovic would have been primarily Frankish, Saxon, or Frisian. In a trading centre like this, they would have set up permanent shelters and also would have built warehouses to store their goods during the winter months. Trade with the Anglo-Saxons, mainly in Kent (and possibly in Hampshire), was vital for the community. Exports to England would have been primarily textiles although they would have also included wine and quern-stones. In Kent, <b>pottery</b> <b>bottles,</b> glasses, textiles, and gold coins from the early 8th have been discovered, all produced by the Franks. Slaves and other goods would have also been exchanged in Quentovic. The earliest mention of Quentovic in literary text was originally believed to have been written in a charter by Dagobert I. It concerned merchants who were travelling to the fair of St-Denis to trade. This charter is now recognized to be a forgery and was most likely written by someone in the late 9th century. Although Quentovic was mainly an economic centre, because of its location it was also a place where people would pass through in their travels.|$|R
50|$|Divers {{must first}} obtain a permit from the Island Harbour Authorities, which is {{available}} through diving shops and centres. The wrecks are mostly located at depths of 35 to 50 metres. Divers are permitted to enter the wrecks, but not to retrieve artefacts located within 100 metres of any wreck. However, time and tide has washed broken pieces of ships' <b>pottery</b> and glass <b>bottles</b> into shallow waters and onto beaches. The underwater visibility, which can vary between 2 and 20 metres, {{is not sufficient to}} view all the length of most wrecks at once; however, current technology is now allowing 3D images of them to be seen.|$|R
2500|$|Rich {{in natural}} {{resources}} including natural gas, coal, clay, and farmland, the town became industrialized and {{was known in}} its early days as [...] "the Pittsburgh of the West", referring to the industrial city in western Pennsylvania of the United States. A number of large industries located here, attracted by the cheap and plentiful energy resources. Coal mines, brick works, <b>pottery</b> and glass <b>bottle</b> manufacturing plants, flour mills, etc. became established. With transportation access via the railway and river, the town became a service and trade center for the agriculture and its products, both commodity crops and livestock, of the surrounding area. Between 1909–1914 the town had an economic boom that increased the population to more than 10,000. Little growth occurred between the World Wars.|$|R
50|$|These {{include the}} tombs at Züschen near Fritzlar, at Lohra, at Naumburg-Altendorf, at Hadamar-Niederzeuzheim (now rebuilt {{in a park}} at Hachenburg), at Beselich-Niedertiefenbach, at Warburg, Rimbeck and at Grossenrode, {{as well as two}} tombs near the Calden enclosure. A tomb at Muschenheim near Münzenberg may also belong to the same type, as may a further one at Bad Vilbel near Frankfurt am Main which was {{destroyed}} after 1945.The best known of these tombs are those of Züschen, Lohra, Niederzeuzzheim and Altendorf. They normally contained the inhumed remains of multiple individuals (the Altendorf tomb contained at least 250 people) of all ages and both sexes. Lohra is an exception insofar as there the dead were cremated. Gravegoods are scarce but include <b>pottery</b> (collared <b>bottles),</b> stone tools and animal bones, especially the jawbones of foxes, which may have played a totemic role. The Züschen tomb is also remarkable for the presence of rock art.Some of the tombs can be directly associated with nearby hilltop sites or settlements, that is, the Züschen tomb with the Hasenberg and the Calden tombs with the earthwork. According to the German archaeologist Waltraud Schrickel, the association with gallery graves suggests a west European influence, perhaps from the Paris Basin in France, where very similar tombs occur. The Wartberg tombs appear to start developing around 3400 BC, earlier than most of the known settlements.|$|R
40|$|Professor David W. Rupp of the Department of Classics {{conducted}} an archaeological excavation {{of a small}} nineteenth century pottery workshop on the escarpment near Jordan, Ontario. The dig was held {{under the auspices of}} the Jordan Historical Museum of the Twenty, the Niagara Peninsula Society of the Archaeological Institute of America and the Brock University Museum of Cypriote Antiquities. The site was said to have been home to the workshop, but early land documents for the area have been lost over the years. The purpose of the project was to train interested volunteers in archaeological field techniques. Mr. Jon Jouppien, Mrs. Rita Michael and Glen Smith also worked with the team thanks to an Ontario Heritage Foundation grant. A partially intact and extremely well-preserved kiln was discovered, as well as <b>pottery,</b> glass <b>bottles</b> and nails. Some of the pottery at the site had the name B. Lent U. C. on it. The U. C. stands for Upper Canada. The closest estimate of the operation of the kiln falls between 1820 and 1840. The material which was found at the dig was studied by Dr. Rupp’s students from his Classical Archaeology course. The focus was on the cultural aspects of the pottery rather than the pottery itself. Some stone tools were also found near the site giving speculation that the site might have been the home to archaic Native People. 2 1 / 2 boxes of textual records outlining the Jordan Pottery Excavation Project...|$|R
50|$|A {{good example}} of a square {{fortress}} tower which stands south-east of the village approximately 1 km away. The village cannot now {{be seen from the}} tower base as the surrounding area is now wooded, however it is 100 metres higher than the village itself. Nowadays it lacks {{a large portion of the}} castellation. It was abandoned during the 17th century where until that time it was a quadrangular-shaped manorial home, with 1.90 metre thick walls. The tower was renovated and heightened in the 11th century from 6 metres to 18 metres in height. Its dual purpose was as a look-out tower preventing Spanish invaders marching on Carcassonne, and a signaling tower using two lit torches sited on the upper platform. The upper platform was re-strengthened in 1980 where originally the main living area would have been found. Recent excavations have unearthed many pieces of black <b>pottery</b> and glass <b>bottle</b> shards which confirmed occupation from the beginning of the 11th century to the 15th century by a colony of Jews.According to legend, the original tower was built in Roman times.|$|R
2500|$|U.S. Federal laws {{governing}} recovery of treasure {{are governed by}} the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, [...] Under ARPA, [...] "archaeological resources" [...] {{more than one hundred}} years old on public lands belongs to the government. [...] The term [...] "archaeological resource" [...] means any material remains of past human life or activities which are [...] "of archaeological interest", as determined by federal regulations. Such regulations include, but are not limited to: <b>pottery,</b> basketry, <b>bottles,</b> weapons, weapon projectiles, tools, structures or portions of structures, pit houses, rock paintings, rock carvings, intaglios, graves, human skeletal materials, or any portion or piece of any of the foregoing items. [...] The definition of [...] "archaeological resource" [...] and [...] "archaeological interest" [...] has been broadly interpreted under U.S. agency regulations in recent years to include nearly anything of human origin more than 100 years old, while permits to allow recovery of such items have been largely restricted to digs by credentialed archaeologists. [...] The effect of ARPA as currently defined by federal regulations outlaws virtually all treasure hunting of items more than 100 years old, even treasure troves of gold and silver coin or scrip, under penalty of total forfeiture. [...] Furthermore, the Federal policy against spoliation and removal of [...] "archaeological resources" [...] of any type from federal or Indian lands, even coins and scrip less than 100 years old, means it is unlikely that a finder of gold or silver coinage on Federal lands will prevail with an argument that the find constitutes a treasure trove of coinage, but rather [...] "embedded property" [...] that belongs to the property owner, i.e. the government. [...] The broad use of ARPA to target not only archaeological looting but also to prohibit all treasure hunting on federal or Indian lands has been criticized on the grounds that total prohibition and forfeiture simply encourages concealment or misrepresentation of the age of the found coinage or treasure trove, thus hampering archaeological research, as archaeologists cannot study items that when found will never be reported.|$|R
5000|$|Rich {{in natural}} {{resources}} including natural gas, coal, clay, and farmland, {{the town was}} known {{in the early days}} as [...] "the Pittsburgh of the West". A number of large industries located here, under the inducement of cheap and plentiful energy resources. Coal mines, brick works, <b>pottery</b> and glass <b>bottle</b> manufacturing plants, flour mills, etc. became established. The agricultural potential of the surrounding area, both in crop and livestock, also made the town a viable service centre with a well established transportation route. An economic boom was experienced between 1909-1914 bringing the population to over 10,000. Little growth occurred between the World Wars, although the population swelled in the mid-1940s due to the town hosting one of the largest P.O.W. camps in Canada during the Second World War. It was not until the 1950s that the town again experienced significant commercial development. Today, Medicine Hat prides itself {{as one of the most}} economical places to live in Canada, with its unique city-owned gas utility and power generation plant being predominant factors. Major industries have included chemical plants, a Goodyear tire and rubber plant, greenhouses, numerous oil and gas related companies, a foundry, I-XL Industries (a brickworks dating from the 1880s), to name a few.|$|R
5000|$|A hint of his {{collection}} skills {{is given in}} a printed catalog of the Alexander Wilson Drake Collection, which was sold at public auction in 1913. The collection included “…Antique samplers and needlework, fragments of old printed chintz, bandboxes, wallpaper, glass <b>bottles,</b> <b>pottery,</b> china, pewter, engraved pledge glasses, antique silver cups and ladles, an extraordinary collection of old finger rings, silver, enameled and pearl snuff boxes, patch boxes and vinaigrettes, old paintings and prints.”Dr. George Frederick Kunz wrote: “The extensive and remarkable collection of the late Alexander Wilson Drake, which was disposed of by the American Art Galleries of New York, March 10th to 17th, 1913, comprised a fine collection of finger rings, illustrating a large variety of forms and periods. There were in all nearly 800 examples, set and unset. There were betrothal rings, memorials rings, gimmal rings, puzzle rings, rings of Roman, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Irish Scandinavian, English and American workmanship, and many Oriental rings, Sassanian, Indian, Japanese, Chinese, Hebrew, Gypsy and Moorish, one of the later being a gold circlet with the twelve signs of the zodiac engraved in high relief around it. The personality of the collector added greatly to the charm of t{{his collection}} for all who had known him. As art editor of Century Magazine, and in a thousand other ways, no one had labored more enthusiastically and successfully {{in the cause of}} art encouragement and art education, and his death constituted a real loss for the progress of art in America…” ...|$|R
