40|$|Growing {{evidence}} indicates that women {{with a history of}} common <b>pregnancy</b> <b>complications,</b> including fetal growth restriction and preterm delivery (often combined as low birth weight), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and gestational diabetes, are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease later in life. The purpose of this paper was to review the associations of parity and these 4 <b>pregnancy</b> <b>complications</b> with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; to review the role of cardiovascular risk factors before, during, and after <b>pregnancy</b> <b>complications</b> in explaining these associations; and to explore the implications of this emerging science for new research and policy. We systematically searched for relevant cohort and case-control studies in Medline through December 2012 and used citation searches for already published reviews to identify new studies. The findings of this review suggest consistent and often strong associations of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>complications</b> with latent and future cardiovascular disease. Many <b>pregnancy</b> <b>complications</b> appear to be preceded by subclinical vascular and metabolic dysfunc-tion, suggesting that the complications may be useful markers of latent high-risk cardiovascular trajectories.

APS provokes blood clots (thrombosis) in both arteries and veins {{as well as}} pregnancy-related complications such as miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery, and severe preeclampsia.The diagnostic criteria require one clinical event, i.e. thrombosis or <b>pregnancy</b> <b>complication,</b> and two antibody blood tests spaced at least three months apart that confirm the presence of either lupus anticoagulant, or anti-β2-glycoprotein-I (since β2-glycoprotein-I antibodies are a subset of anti-cardiolipin antibodies, an anti-cardiolipin assay can be performed as a less specific proxy).|$|E

In this study, we examined the role of alkaline phosphatase (AP) in mitigating LPS-induced early <b>pregnancy</b> <b>complications</b> in mice. We found that 1) the uterus prior to implantation and implantation sites following embryo implantation produce LPS recognition and dephosphorylation molecules TLR 4 and tissue non-specific AP (TNAP) isozyme, respectively; 2) uterine TNAP isozyme dephosphorylates LPS at its sites of production; 3) while LPS administration following embryo implantation elicits proinflammatory cytokine mRNA levels at the embryo implantation sites (EISs) and causes early pregnancy loss, dephosphorylated LPS neither triggers proinflammatory cytokine mRNA levels at the EISs nor induces pregnancy complications; 4) AP isozyme supplementation to accelerate LPS detoxification attenuates LPS-induced <b>pregnancy</b> <b>complications</b> following embryo implantation.

40|$|Background: Controversy {{surrounds}} {{the role of}} fetal cardiotocography (CTG) in the antenatal management of pregnancy complicated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Aim: The aim was to investigate whether antenatal CTG aids the management in pregnancy complicated by GDM. Materials and Methods: A prospective audit of 1404 consecutive antenatal CTGs in women diagnosed with GDM. Outcomes for all CTGs were audited {{to determine if the}} CTGs altered pregnancy management. Results: In women requiring combination therapy (diet and medication), 43 CTGs were required to change management of a pregnancy. In women managed by diet alone with a secondary <b>pregnancy</b> <b>complication,</b> 161 CTGs were required to change management. In women managed by diet alone with no secondary <b>pregnancy</b> <b>complication,</b> CTGs did not change management.

40|$|Context: Maternal serum human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) and Alpha Fetal Protein (AFP) were {{originally}} introduced to detect trisomy 21 and neural tube defects. However, {{in the absence}} of aneuploidy or neural tube defects, mid-trimester maternal serum hCG and/or maternal serum AFP associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Pregnancies with unexplained mid-trimester elevation in maternal serum hCG and/ or maternal serum AFP, are at increased risk for <b>pregnancy</b> <b>complications</b> resulting from placental insufficiency. Evidence Acquisition: Mid-trimester maternal serum hCG> 2. 5 MoM associated with an increased risk for <b>pregnancy</b> <b>complications</b> including: late fetal loss, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm delivery and intrauterine fetal death(IUFD). Mid-trimester maternal serum AFP levels> 2. 5 MoM are thought to reflect a defect in placentation and associated with an increased risk for <b>pregnancy</b> <b>complications</b> including: late fetal loss, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, IUGR, preterm delivery and IUFD. Results: Combined mid-trimester elevation in maternal serum hCG and AFP levels suggest a more complex type of placental pathology. They have stronger association with <b>pregnancy</b> <b>complications</b> including: late fetal loss, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, IUGR, preterm delivery and IUFD. Conclusions: Mid-trimester maternal serum hCG or AFP levels alone cannot detect all pregnant women with increased risk to develop <b>pregnancy</b> <b>complications.</b> Multiparameter testing of placental function in mid-trimester (maternal serum hCG and AFP screening, uterine artery Doppler and placental morphology) may allow us to identify women with increased risk to develop severe placental insufficiency an...|$|R
