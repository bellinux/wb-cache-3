2500|$|The {{greatest}} {{test of the}} TD battalions {{and their}} M5 guns came during the Battle of the Bulge. In this battle, towed tank destroyers fought much less successfully and suffered much higher losses than the self-propelled ones. A report from the aforementioned 823rd battalion said that [...] "tank destroyer guns were one by one flanked by enemy tanks and <b>personnel</b> <b>driven</b> from guns by small arms and machine guns fire". Taking the recent combat experience into account, on 11 January 1945, the War Department confirmed a request to convert the towed TD battalions to the self-propelled form. This decision meant the gradual removal of the M5 from frontline service, a process that continued {{until the end of}} the war in Europe.|$|R

50|$|The {{combined}} staff (sometimes {{referred to as}} the Benelux Admiralty) is a result of developing naval cooperation between the Royal Netherlands Navy and the Belgian Navy. This cooperation was first geared at mutual battlefield cooperation and later at mutual defense in the Cold War as part of NATO's Allied Command Channel (ACCHAN). One of ACCHAN's subordinate commands was the Benelux Sub-Area Channel Command (BENECHAN) based in Den Helder and consisting of the Belgian and Dutch navies. After the end of the Cold War the focus of the Dutch-Belgian cooperation turned more and more to the efficient use of equipment and <b>personnel</b> (also <b>driven</b> by cutbacks in military spending {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union).|$|R

Harry abducts and interrogates Coaver, who denies any knowledge of the attacks. Coaver is surrendered to a group posing as CIA <b>personnel,</b> who <b>drive</b> away with him moments before the actual CIA officers arrive. When the MI5 team realise their mistake, they give chase. Coaver is pushed out of the rear of the speeding van during the pursuit and subsequently dies on the street. The CIA applies pressure on Home Secretary William Towers (Simon Russell Beale), as they believe Harry to be directly responsible for Coaver's death. They demand Harry be handed over to CIA custody for extradition to the United States. Harry urgently requests that Towers bring the signing of the agreement forward as quickly as possible.|$|R
50|$|During {{the recent}} {{operations}} this officer has displayed magnificent courage and determination in attacking enemy aerodromes, kite balloons and retreating columns, inflicting very heavy loss. On 29 October he led two other machines in a bombing raid against an enemy aerodrome; he completely destroyed with a bomb, one hostile machine on the ground; and, attacking the hangars and workshops with machine-gun fire, he caused many casualties amongst the mechanics. Later {{on in the}} same day he returned alone to attack the same aerodrome, and found the enemy about to evacuate it. Flying at a very low altitude—at times his wheels almost touched the ground—he destroyed one machine with a bomb and set fire to another with machine-gun fire. The enemy <b>personnel</b> were <b>driven</b> back into the village by the vigour of his attack. Captain Goode's utter disregard of personal danger inspired all who served with him.|$|R

50|$|According {{to reports}} by Deadline Hollywood, members of Boston's local Teamsters Union {{allegedly}} harassed and intimidated Lakshmi and other Top Chef staff during the production's June film shoot at the Steel & Rye restaurant in Milton, Massachusetts. The Teamsters Local 25, upset that Bravo hired non-union <b>personnel</b> to <b>drive</b> {{cast and crew}} around Milton, protested the filming, threatening staff using racist, sexist, and homophobic language, and slashing the tires of several crew-owned vehicles. While the network insisted the incident was isolated, sources for The Boston Globe reported that the threats did prompt Bravo to change the locations of some tapings. Teamsters Local 25 later released a statement denying the allegations. Four Teamsters were then indicted on charges of conspiracy to extort, attempted extortion, and aiding and abetting. The trial began on August 1, 2017. On August 15, 2017, a jury acquitted the four Teamsters of all charges.|$|R

50|$|By 1967, {{the influx}} of {{military}} <b>personnel</b> had <b>driven</b> the town population up to 2,500, aided {{by the fact that}} some air force personnel assigned to the base chose to return to the area permanently following retirement. However, in the 1970s, the provincial government declared most of the valley to be an agricultural land reserve, slowing the burgeoning development in the village to a crawl. In 1972, the old Elk Hotel at the foot of Wharf Road, now used as a dance hall, was destroyed by fire. Shortly afterwards, James Robb's 90-year-old pier at the end of Wharf Road was demolished, and landfill was used to create a sheltering seawall for fishing vessels, as well as a marina for recreational craft. In 1977, former lumber giant Bob Filberg died and bequeathed his lodge to the Vancouver Foundation. When local residents discovered that the lodge was slated to be demolished and its grounds turned into a housing development, arrangements were made with the Comox town council to turn the lodge and grounds into a public park known as the Filberg Heritage Lodge and Park.|$|R
40|$|Although climatic {{heat stress}} can be fully {{brought under control}} and {{prevented}} from causing short-term or long-term damage to the human body in laboratory experiments, the expected effect of interventions are however often lost in the practice on construction site as frontline <b>personnel</b> are <b>driven</b> by conflicting institutional logics in their specific institutional environment. The paper presents a comparative study between Hong Kong and Mainland China {{in the case of}} climatic heat stress management on construction sites. Specifically, we look into how societal culture as institutional logics leads workers and managers to their pragmatic or normative behaviours that deviate from the expected outcome of safety management. Two competing institutional logics in construction safety management are identified and discussed, i. e., production logic and prevention logic. Comparative analysis of the Chinese samples under two different institutional environments identifies two distinct society-level cultural logics that shape personal strategies of reconciling safety and production goals, i. e., Confucianism logic and Chinese pragmatism logic. Their implications on construction safety management are further discussed...|$|R

50|$|The oil {{refinery}} at Thomas {{is one of}} only five refineries that was operating in Oklahoma in 2015. Formerly known as the Barrett Refinery, this facility has a rated capacity of 14,000 barrels per day. In the oil industry, a barrel (Bbl) is equal to 42 U. S. gallons. Hence, this is now the smallest refinery operating in the state. After the Barrett Company declared bankruptcy, the refinery was scheduled to close permanently on December 22, 2005. Instead, an Oklahoma City firm, Ventura Refining and Transmission, LLC. Revival of the refinery was expected to open up about 30 to 50 new local jobs, excluding <b>personnel</b> needed to <b>drive</b> about 30 trucks handling product deliveries per day.|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the problems and challenges facing the Amathole District Municipality when implementing Local Economic Development (LED) projects. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the factors affecting this implementation. The other major challenge is the number of different institutions and agencies that are involved in LED. Consequently, the desired results cannot be achieved, thus the communities continue to live in poverty, the local economy cannot improve and there will be a high rate of unemployment. In order to address the research problem and to achieve the research objectives, available literature on Local Economic Development was reviewed. Empirical data was also collected making use of face-to-face interviews. The research revealed that the implementation of LED projects has not been entirely effective, mainly caused by the lack of capacity within the municipality to fully provide support in the implementation of LED projects; limited funding; shortage of personnel; political and administrative instability; problems regarding to social facilitation; and LED not being prioritised by the municipality and also seen as an unfunded mandate. From the investigation, the findings indicate that the effective implementation of these projects require strengthened capacity which needs more funding, more skilled <b>personnel</b> to <b>drive</b> the process, de-politicised development and the municipality to prioritise high impact projects that yield sustainability as opposed to smaller projects that unsustainabl...|$|R
50|$|The core {{components}} of a cost allocation system consist {{of a way to}} track which organizations provides a product and/or service, the organizations that consume the products and/or services, and a list of portfolio offerings (e.g. service catalog). Depending on the operating structure within a company, the cost allocation data may generate an internal invoice or feed an ERP system's chargeback module. Accessing the data via an invoice or chargeback module are the typical methods that <b>drive</b> <b>personnel</b> behavior. In return, the consumption data becomes a great source of quantitative information to make better business decisions. Today’s organizations face growing pressure to control costs and enable responsible financial management of resources. In this environment, an organization is expected to provide services cost-effectively and deliver business value while operating under tight budgetary constraints. One way to contain costs is to implement a cost allocation methodology, where your business units become directly accountable for the services they consume.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MA (Geography and Environmental Studies)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The Rural Aquaculture Development Programme (RADP) of the Division of Aquaculture at Stellenbosch University (DASU) has the {{objective}} of socio-economic development of farm workers and rural communities from previously disadvantaged communities through the provision of opportunities for sustainable economic development by establishing small-scale fish-farming systems on irrigation dams. The Small-Scale Aquaculture Farming Systems (SSAFS) is an initiative of RADP. DASU intends implementing 20 new projects {{by the end of}} 2005, 100 by 2010 and at least 200 by 2020. Thus far, sites which can accommodate 25 projects have been identified. The owners of the land on which these 25 possible projects are located are being contacted to gain permission to use the sites for the SSAFS. It is possible that some of the owners of the sites will not allow them to be used so that not all 25 projects will necessarily be implemented. At present the predominant search method employed by DASU to find new sites involves two steps. Initially knowledge is acquired through word of mouth about dams that may be suitable. <b>Personnel</b> then <b>drive</b> to these dams for further inspection, to see if they are indeed suitable. This method of search is clearly both expensive and time-consuming. Geographical information systems (GIS) have as yet not been considered as an alternative and/or supplementary site selection method for the SSAFS. GIS tools and principles can reduce both expenses and time in locating sites by reducing the number of dams to be visited to only those that are optimal (i. e. they present the least risk of the SSAFS projects failing). A new site selection methodology using GIS was developed which is faster and less expensive than existing site selection methods. The GIS site selection methodology revolves around the isolation and selection of dams in the Berg and Breede River water management areas, based on their ability to fulfil certain parameters of critical variables comprising dam dimensions, environmental issues, distance measures and site security, according to a priority hierarchy, that determine a successful site for trout farming according to methods employed by the SSAFS. Once this methodology was produced, it was presented to five people who are directly involved with the SSAFS as well as four others who are not involved with the SSAFS but who might find the methodology useful, to determine whether they hold that the methodology is indeed better than existing search methodologies. Those who were presented the GIS site selection methodology felt that it is very useful and that it could be employed in future to make more informed choices when locating new sites for the SSAFS as well as other aquacultural enterprises...|$|R
