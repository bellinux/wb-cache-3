40|$|Decontamination cover forming {{cracks and}} vent cup {{assembly}} leaks through the decontamination covers were early manufacturing problems. The decontamination cover total manufacturing process yield was {{as low as}} 55 %. Applicable tooling and procedures were examined. All manufacturing steps from foil fabrication to final assembly leak testing were considered as possible causes or contributing factors to these problems. The following principal changes were made to correct these problems: (1) the foil annealing temperature was reduced from 1375 {degrees} to 1250 {degrees}C, (2) the decontamination cover fabrication procedure (including visual inspection for surface imperfections and elimination of superfluous operations) was improved, (3) the <b>postforming</b> dye penetrant inspection procedure was revised for increased sensitivity, (4) a <b>postforming</b> (prewelding) 1250 {degrees}C/ 1 h vacuum stress-relief operation was added, (5) a poststress relief (prewelding) decontamination cover piece-part leak test was implemented, (6) the hold-down fixture used during the decontamination cover-to-cup weld was modified, and concomitantly, and (7) the foil fabrication process was changed from the extruding and rolling of 63 -mm-diam vacuum arc-remelted ingots (extrusion process) to the rolling of 19 -mm-square arc-melted drop castings (drop cast process). Since these changes were incorporated, the decontamination cover total manufacturing process yield has been 91 %. Most importantly, more than 99 % of the decontamination covers welded onto vent cup assemblies were acceptable. The drastic yield improvement is attributed primarily to {{the change in the}} foil annealing temperature from 1375 {degrees} to 1250 {degrees}C and secondarily to the improvements in the decontamination cover fabrication procedure...|$|E
50|$|Overall, the <b>postform</b> {{countertop}} is {{the most}} economical countertop on the market, and has the broadest selection of surface material to choose from. Surfaces can be either a solid color, or a pattern, and textures range from a satin funiture finish to a heavily textured stone or pebbled appearance to a high gloss resolution. Because of this diversity, the <b>postform</b> countertop can satisfy {{a wide variety of}} design applications, and due to its economy, it can be easily replaced to provide a fresh appearance in any room.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>postform</b> {{countertop}} {{is typically}} a high volume factory-produced product, {{which accounts for}} {{the economy of the}} product. The material composition consists of a single thin sheet of laminate (typically [...]030" [...] - [...]040" [...] in thickness) that gets bonded to a 45# density particle board substrate (or other similar base material such as MDF - medium density fiberboard, or plywood), with a PVA adhesive (poly vinyl acetate - a water-based adhesive). Traditionally <b>postform</b> countertops were manufactured with a solvent-based contact cement (a highly flammable, volatile organic compound - VOC). However, in today's marketplace PVA adhesives have taken over for reasons of environmental responsibility (no VOC's), safety (non-combustible), economy, and strength of the glue line.|$|R
30|$|The working {{principle}} of the hand-held laser three-dimensional scanner {{is to use the}} characteristics of the laser. The laser has less variation, less divergence, and almost no difference in the visible state. During operation, a continuous laser beam is emitted to the object to be measured by the laser emission source of the scanner head, and the beam is reflected after being touched by the object. The scanning probe has a certain number and angle of reflection points, and the camera is reflected back. The corresponding signal, through the reflected distance of the received reflected laser light, calculates and records the reflected azimuth angle, transforming the measured object itself into coordinate points one after another. The final measured data is a set of massive stereo-digitized lattices, also known as point clouds, or a combination of triangular patches, which can be edited and output by special <b>postforming</b> software.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Objective of {{this study}} is to present new {{developments}} in thermo-plastic pultrusion (a pullbraiding process combined with a contact preheating system, and a new online forming method for pultruded profiles) and a new approach for modelling of the preheating process. After modelling of the preheating process of commingled glass fibre/polypropylene yarn, the preheating of a thermoplastic pultrusion line to produce profiles with unidirectional reinforcement in axial direction was modified by adding contact heating pins. Compared to the convective heating used before, profiles with higher qualities could be produced at three times higher processing speeds. First trials of a combined braiding and pultrusion process, also with contact preheating, led to promising results. Furthermore, a process to post-form pultruded profiles immediately after leaving the heated pultrusion die was developed, leading to profiles with a forming radius of 10 cm.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the {{influence}} of the initial microstructure of several Mg–Al alloys on their superplastic formability and on their post-forming microstructure and mechanical properties. Various thermomechanical processing routes, such as annealing, conventional rolling, severe rolling and cross rolling, were used in order to fabricate AZ 31 and AZ 61 alloys with different grain sizes. These materials were then blow formed into a hat shaped die. It was found that the processing route has only a small effect in the formability of Mg–Al alloys or on the <b>postforming</b> microstructures and properties due to rapid dynamic grain growth taking place at the forming temperatures. Nevertheless, good formability is achieved as a result of the simultaneous operation of grain boundary sliding and crystallographic slip during forming.

A very specific machine for cutting the <b>postform</b> countertop is manufactured by only a few companies, it is commonly called a Cutting Station, Top Saw, or simply Miter Saw. This machine accurately cuts the countertop to field dimensions, making it easy for the installer to make the final scribe cuts on-site to complete the work. Sink cut outs can be made either in the field or at the installers shop.|$|R
40|$|A pseudochannel {{extension}} of the coupled-reaction-channel (CRC) method is investigated formally and numerically {{as a means of}} simulating the effect of the breakup channel on the rearrangement amplitudes. The equations of the pseudostate-augmented CRC method are derived within a two-Hilbert-space approach. The connection of the effective CRC transition operators with the <b>postform</b> transition operators of the formal scattering theory is established. Alternative formulations of the method corresponding to different ways of treating the nonorthogonality interaction are given. Convergence with respect to the number and nature of the pseudostates are investigated numerically on a solvable three-particle model.

40|$|Friction free' {{bearings}} at 77 K {{or higher}} are possible using the high T(sub c) copper oxide ceramic superconductors. The conventional method for making such bearings {{is to use}} a sintered ceramic monolith. This puts great restraints on size, shape, and <b>postforming</b> machining. The material is hard and abrasive. It is possible to grind up ceramic superconductors and suspend the granules in a suitable matrix. Mechanical properties improve and are largely dependent on the binder. The Meissner effect is confined to individual grains containing electron vortices. Tracks, rails, levitation areas, and bearings can be made this way with conventional plastic molding and extruding machines or by painting. The parts are easily machined. The sacrifice is in bulk electrical conductivity. A percolating wick feed for LN 2 is used to cool remote superconductors and large areas quite effectively. A hollow spheroid or cylinder of superconductor material is molded with the internal surfaces shielded by the Meissner effect. It {{can be thought of as}} the DC magnetic analog of the Faraday cage and the inside is the 'Meissner space'. It is selective. The AC fields are transmitted with minor attenuation.

40|$|The {{ability to}} make a socket by apply-ing a {{thermoplastic}} material such as Poly-sar X- 414 (Polymer Corp. Ltd. TM) di-rectly to an amputee's stump offers many advantages to the prosthetist, as pointed out by Wilson (4). Direct forming obvi-ously eliminates the casting procedures necessary to produce a good modified rep-lica of the stump and eliminates the lami-nating procedures necessary to produce the socket. The thermoplastic properties of Polysar X- 414 allows quick <b>postforming</b> of the socket in areas which may require relief, and the material lends itself well to the attachment of components during as-sembly. These time-saving advantages en-able the prosthetist to fit amputees with a temporary prosthesis much earlier than the time normally required for a defini-tive fitting. This hastens the amputee's rehabilitation and helps to condition him and his stump for the definitive prosthesis. The prosthetist also {{has the advantage of}} noting any corrections which are applicable to the definitive prosthesis. These advan-tages are also helpful to the research pros-thetist, for he can save valuable time in evaluating new control techniques and testing new components. A direct-forming technique related to those developed by Staros and Gardner (3) for below-knee PTB sockets and by Labate and Pirrello (1) for below-elbow sockets using Polysar X- 414 has been de-veloped for above-elbow sockets. If done properly, this technique will provide a well-fitting socket which has the above-mentioned advantages. A complete above-elbow prosthesis can be fabricated in ap-proximately three hours. The technique was used at this center to construct Polysar sockets for four above-elbow amputees who participated in an evaluation study of externally powered upper-extremity prosthetic components. Each amputee (described briefly below) wore his prosthesis successfully for two hours a day, three days a week, during a two-month period without problems. D.

40|$|Cyclic {{butylene}} terephthalate (CBT®) oligomers are {{a relatively}} new class of material and are capable of polymerizing in an entropically driven ring-opening polymerization into high-molecular-weight polymerized CBT (pCBT) in very short times, i. e., within minutes. The most important feature of CBT is its very low, water-like melt viscosity prior to polymerization which gives rise to an excellent impregnation of fibrous reinforcements in contrast to conventional, high viscous thermoplastic resins. This opens up new possibilities in the thermoplastic composite production since thermoplastic-based composites show some advantages over thermoset-based ones. Specifically, they have a higher toughness and impact strength {{and they can be}} welded, <b>postformed,</b> and recycled due to their thermoplastic nature. CBT has the potential to substitute thermoset matrices in fiber-reinforced composites and may solve some of the today´s recycling issues associated with thermoset-based composites. Moreover, the low melt viscosity of CBT enhances the dispersion of nano- or conductive particles and can yield superior nano- and conductive composites. This article reviews the recent advances in processing–structure–property relationship, physical and chemical modification of pCBT, as well as the preparation of fiber-reinforced pCBT composites, pCBT nanocomposites, and conductive pCBT composites.

40|$|Tin holds {{promise as}} an anode {{material}} for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) {{because of its}} high theoretical capacity, but its cycle life is limited by structural degradation. Herein, a novel approach is exploited to insert Sn nanoparticles into the pores of highly stable titanium dioxide-carbon (TiO 2 -x-C) nanofiber substrates that can effectively localize the <b>postformed</b> smaller Sn nanoparticles, thereby {{address the problem of}} structural degradation, and thus achieve improved anode performance. During first lithiation, a Li 4. 4 Sn alloy is inserted into the pores surrounding the initial Sn nanoparticles in TiO 2 -x-C nanofibers by its large volume expansion. Thereafter, the original Sn nanoparticle with a diameter of about 150 nm cannot be recovered by the delithiation because of the surface absorption between inserted Sn nanoparticles and the TiO 2 -x-C substrate, resulting in many smaller Sn nanoparticles remaining in the pores. Batteries containing these porous TiO 2 -x-C-Sn nanofibers exhibit a high capacity of 957 mAh g- 1 after 200 cycles at 0. 1 A g- 1 and can cycle over 10 000 times at 3 A g- 1 while retaining 82. 3 % of their capacity, which represents the longest cycling life of Sn-based anodes for LIBs so far. This interesting method can provide new avenues for other high-capacity anode material systems that suffer from significant volume expansion.

40|$|The bent timber laths of the Sound Bites gridshell create {{two types}} of {{performance}} space over an area of almost 100 m 2. Such <b>postformed</b> gridshells are a wellestablished design solution for creating curved forms from linear elements. Extending principles developed since the 1970 s, contemporary digital tools have been utilised to drive {{a renewed interest in}} them, primarily through so-called form-finding techniques which connect digital and material models through a simulation of shape under bending loads (Nettlebladt, 2013) and the definition of efficient structural geometry acting under compression loads only (Hernandez et. al., 2012). This paper describes the workflow conceived and implemented for the Sound Bites structure. A central challenge of the research was for such a workflow to allow for the principles of gridshell design to be engaged in parallel to other tight constraints and design drivers. As such it needed to facilitate close collaboration between architectural, engineering and fabrication experts. This workflow was tested in the design and realisation of the full-scale structure within a six-week period. The gridshell design was developed through the manipulation of the shape of two edge profiles and the shell form spanning between these. Architectural and fabrication constraints were met and the workflow allowed for a sufficient level of structural analysis to be fed back to inform the design...|$|R
