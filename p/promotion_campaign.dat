5|$|Despite The Big Room being {{critically}} acclaimed, {{it was not}} as commercially {{successful as}} their first album, which Verdens Gang attributed to a lacklustre <b>promotion</b> <b>campaign</b> by Atlantic Records. Half way through their tour with Jewel in mid July, M2M were removed as the opening act by Atlantic who cited disappointing sales of The Big Room, which at that time had sold around 100,000 units in America. Shocked and disappointed by the decision, M2M returned to Norway, and ceased performing together. Raven was immediately offered a solo record contract from Atlantic, though she later withdrew from the offer.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a {{methodology}} to guide managers in determining the optimal <b>promotion</b> <b>campaigns</b> to be directed towards different market segments in order to maximize the value of customers. For the purposes of this study, a two-step methodology is used, based on stochastic dynamic programming and the classification and regression tree. This methodology groups the customers according to their value. Within this framework, an experiment is conducted in which each of the different <b>promotion</b> <b>campaigns</b> is assigned to different randomly selected groups. The impact of each type of promotion on each type of market segment is analysed in order to find the optimal <b>promotion</b> <b>campaigns</b> appropriate for each. In contrast to previous research, this study takes into account a firm that provides more than one specific type of product or service. In addition, it analyses the impact of widely used types of <b>promotion</b> <b>campaigns</b> compared with the narrow scope of those investigated in previous studies. Therefore, this research presents important insights into managing relations with the customers in a more interactive and profitable way...|$|R

25|$|Shooting of {{the film}} was a {{draining}} experience for the actors involved due to the demands that Lang placed on them. For the scene where the worker's city was flooded, Helm and 500 children from the poorest districts of Berlin had to work for 14 days {{in a pool of}} water that Lang intentionally kept at a low temperature. Lang would frequently demand numerous re-takes, and took two days to shoot a simple scene where Freder collapses at Maria's feet; by the time Lang was satisfied with the footage he had shot, actor Gustav Fröhlich found he could barely stand. Other anecdotes involve Lang's insistence on using real fire for the climactic scene where the false Maria is burnt at the stake (which resulted in Helm's dress catching fire), and his ordering extras to throw themselves towards powerful jets of water when filming the flooding of the worker's city. UFA invited several trade journal representatives and several film critics to see the film's shooting as parts of its <b>promotion</b> <b>campaign.</b>|$|E

25|$|Following {{management}} changes, Swindon {{had a long}} unsuccessful period {{culminating in}} them being relegated in 1982 to the Fourth Division, the lowest professional Football League at the time. They were eventually promoted as champions in 1986 with the club achieving a Football League record of 102 points, the second club to score over 100 points in a season, York City having totalled 101 two years earlier. A year later they won the Third Division play-offs to achieve a second successive promotion. <b>Promotion</b> <b>campaign</b> Manager Lou Macari left in 1989 {{to take charge of}} West Ham United with veteran midfielder, and former Argentine international, Ossie Ardiles replacing him. In his first season, Swindon were Second Division play-off winners, but the club later admitted 36 charges of breaching league rules, 35 due to illegal payments made to players, and were relegated to the Third Division— giving Sunderland promotion to the First Division and Tranmere Rovers to the Second Division. The scandal saw then chairman Brian Hillier being given a six-month prison sentence and chief accountant Vince Farrar being put on probation. A later appeal saw Swindon Town being allowed to stay in the Second Division.|$|E
