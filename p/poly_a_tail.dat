40|$|The Nucleic Acid Research Group (NARG) has {{conducted}} experiments {{to determine the}} impact of RNA integrity and priming strategies on cDNA synthesis and Real-Time RT-qPCR. As {{a continuation of the}} RNA integrity theme, this year's study was expanded to evaluate the impact of RNA integrity on priming strategies for the analysis of nine miRNA targets using Real-Time RT-qPCR. The nine targets were selected based on data obtained by the Microarray Research Group (MARG) and represent groups of miRNAs that are expressed at low, medium, or high levels in the First Choice human brain reference RNA sample. The two RT-qPCR priming strategies tested in this study include the miRNA TaqMan assay (Megaplex) of ABI and the RT 2 miRNA qPCR assay of Qiagen/SA Biosciences. The basis for the ABI assay design is a target specific stem-loop structure and reverse-transcription primer, while the Qiagen design combines <b>poly</b> (<b>A)</b> <b>tailing</b> and <b>a</b> universal reverse transcription in one cDNA synthesis reaction. For this study to assess both RT methods, samples that were used as templates were human brain reference RNA that has been subjected to controlled degradation using RNase A to RIN (RNA Integrity Number) values of 7 (good), 4 (moderately degraded), and 2 (severely degraded). In addition to this Real-Time RT-qPCR data, the same RNA templates were further analyzed using universal <b>poly</b> (<b>A)</b> <b>tailing</b> followed by hybridization to Affymetrix miRNA GeneChips.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{conducted}} a comparative genomic study {{based on a}} neutral approach to identify genome specificities associated with the virulence capacity of pathogenic bacteria. We also determined whether virulence is dictated by rules, {{or if it is}} the result of individual evolutionary histories. We systematically compared the genomes of the 12 most dangerous pandemic bacteria for humans ("bad bugs") to their closest non-epidemic related species ("controls"). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found several significantly different features in the "bad bugs", one of which was a smaller genome that likely resulted from a degraded recombination and repair system. The 10 Cluster of Orthologous Group (COG) functional categories revealed a significantly smaller number of genes in the "bad bugs", which lacked mostly transcription, signal transduction mechanisms, cell motility, energy production and conversion, and metabolic and regulatory functions. A few genes were identified as virulence factors, including secretion system proteins. Five "bad bugs" showed a greater number of <b>poly</b> (<b>A)</b> <b>tails</b> compared to the controls, whereas an elevated number of <b>poly</b> (<b>A)</b> <b>tails</b> was found to be strongly correlated to a low GC% content. The "bad bugs" had fewer tandem repeat sequences compared to controls. Moreover, the results obtained from a principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the "bad bugs" had surprisingly more toxin-antitoxin modules than did the controls. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that pathogenic capacity is not the result of "virulence factors" but is the outcome of a virulent gene repertoire resulting from reduced genome repertoires. Toxin-antitoxin systems could participate in the virulence repertoire, but they may have developed independently of selfish evolution...|$|R
5000|$|Polyadenylation is the {{addition}} of a [...] "tail" [...] of adenylate residues to an RNA transcript about 20 bases downstream of the AAUAAA sequence within the three prime untranslated region. Polyadenylation of mRNA has a strong effect on its nuclear transport, translation efficiency, and stability. All of these as well as the process of polyadenylation depend on binding of specific RBPs. All eukaryotic mRNAs with few exceptions are processed to receive 3' <b>poly</b> (<b>A)</b> <b>tails</b> of about 200 nucleotides. One of the necessary protein complexes in this process is CPSF. CPSF binds to the 3' tail (AAUAAA) sequence and together with another protein called poly(A)-binding protein, recruits and stimulates the activity of poly(A) polymerase. Poly(A) polymerase is inactive on its own and requires the binding of these other proteins to function properly.|$|R

(b) Non-obliga¬tory preterm codons are never used in α and β and avoided in γ genes. (c) Substitutions involving U are much less frequent than expected (p « 0. 001). The complementary strands (CCS) of β, γ (and ε), if read in the same frame of globin CS, contain coding, leader and <b>poly</b> <b>A</b> <b>tailing</b> sequences as well as four splicing sequences, with the appropriate polarity, thus showing the required properties for coding a protein. Points (a) and (b) hold true also for CCS gene. Moreover, none of the described β variants (168) removes initiation or introduces termination codons in the CCS. According to these observations it seems conceivable that fixation of the actual globin gene sequences, among the 1070 synonymous, and of the pattern of SNS are the result of selective processes that avoid drastic consequences for hemoglobin function.

Magnetic beads have also been used in plasmid assembly. Rapid genetic circuit construction has been achieved by the sequential addition of genes onto a growing genetic chain, using nanobeads as an anchor. This method has been shown to be much faster than previous methods, taking less than an hour to create functional multi-gene constructs in vitro.|$|E

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{and small}} {{nucleolar}} RNAs (snoRNAs) are {{two classes of}} small non-coding regulatory RNAs, which have been much investigated in recent years. While their respective functions in the cell are distinct, they share interesting genomic similarities, and recent sequencing projects have identified processed forms of snoRNAs that resemble miRNAs. Here, we investigate a possible evolutionary relationship between miRNAs and box H/ACA snoRNAs. A comparison of the genomic locations of reported miRNAs and snoRNAs reveals an overlap of specific members of these classes. To test the hypothesis that some miRNAs might have evolved from snoRNA encoding genomic regions, reported miRNA-encoding regions were scanned {{for the presence of}} box H/ACA snoRNA features. Twenty miRNA precursors show significant similarity to H/ACA snoRNAs as predicted by snoGPS. These include molecules predicted to target known ribosomal RNA pseudouridylation sites in vivo for which no guide snoRNA has yet been reported. The predicted folded structures of these twenty H/ACA snoRNA-like miRNA precursors reveal molecules which resemble the structures of known box H/ACA snoRNAs. The genomic regions surrounding these predicted snoRNA-like miRNAs are often similar to regions around snoRNA retroposons, including the presence of transposable elements, target site duplications and <b>poly</b> (<b>A)</b> <b>tails.</b> We further show that the precursors of five H/ACA snoRNA-like miRNAs (miR- 151, miR- 605, mir- 664, miR- 215 and miR- 140) bind to dyskerin, a specific protein component of functional box H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complexes suggesting that these molecules have retained some H/ACA snoRNA functionality.

50|$|Enhancers as {{sites of}} extragenic {{transcription}} were initially discovered in genome-wide studies that identified enhancers as common regions of RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) binding and non-coding RNA transcription. The level of RNA pol II-enhancer interaction and RNA transcript formation {{were found to}} be highly variable among these initial studies. Using explicit chromatin signature peaks, a significant proportion (~70%) of extragenic RNA Pol II transcription start sites were found to overlap enhancer sites in murine macrophages. Out of 12,000 neuronal enhancers in the mouse genome, almost 25% of the sites were found to bind RNA Pol II and generate transcripts. These eRNAs, unlike messenger RNAs (mRNAs), lacked modification by polyadenylation, were generally short and non-coding, and were bidirectionally transcribed. Later studies revealed the transcription of another type of eRNAs, generated through unidirectional transcription, that were longer and contained a <b>poly</b> <b>A</b> <b>tail.</b> Furthermore, eRNA levels were correlated with mRNA levels of nearby genes, suggesting the potential regulatory and functional role of these non-coding enhancer RNA molecules.|$|E
50|$|The {{sequencing}} of cDNA will produce the entire mRNA transcript that generated it. Practically, {{only part of}} the sequence is required to uniquely identify the mRNA or protein associated. The resultant part of the sequence was termed the expressed sequence tag (EST) and is always {{at the end of the}} sequence close to the <b>poly</b> <b>A</b> <b>tail.</b> EST data are stored in a database called dbEST. ESTs only need to be around 400 bases long, but with NGS sequencing techniques this will still produce low quality reads. Therefore, an improved method called serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) is also used. This method identifies, for each cDNA transcript molecule produced from a cell's gene expression, regions only 10-14 bases long anywhere along the read sequence, sufficient to uniquely identify that cDNA transcript. These bases are cut out and linked together, then incorporated into bacterial plasmids as mentioned above. SAGE libraries have better read quality and generate a larger amount of data when sequenced, and since transcripts are compared in absolute rather than relative levels, SAGE has the advantage of requiring no normalisation of data via comparison with a reference.|$|E
5000|$|Regulatory regions {{within the}} 3'-untranslated region can {{influence}} polyadenylation, translation efficiency, localization, {{and stability of}} the mRNA. [...] The 3'-UTR contains both binding sites for regulatory proteins as well as microRNAs (miRNAs). By binding to specific sites within the 3'-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript. The 3'-UTR also has silencer regions which bind to repressor proteins and will inhibit {{the expression of the}} mRNA. Many 3'-UTRs also contain AU-rich elements (AREs). Proteins bind AREs to affect the stability or decay rate of transcripts in a localized manner or affect translation initiation. Furthermore, the 3'-UTR contains the sequence AAUAAA that directs addition of several hundred adenine residues called the poly(A) tail {{to the end of the}} mRNA transcript. Poly(A) binding protein (PABP) binds to this tail, contributing to regulation of mRNA translation, stability, and export. For example, <b>poly</b> (<b>A)</b> <b>tail</b> bound PABP interacts with proteins associated with the 5' end of the transcript, causing a circularization of the mRNA that promotes translation. The 3'-UTR can also contain sequences that attract proteins to associate the mRNA with the cytoskeleton, transport it to or from the cell nucleus, or perform other types of localization. In addition to sequences within the 3'-UTR, the physical characteristics of the region, including its length and secondary structure, contribute to translation regulation. These diverse mechanisms of gene regulation ensure that the correct genes are expressed in the correct cells at the appropriate times.|$|E
40|$|Folic acid (FA) is a core {{micronutrient}} {{involved in}} DNA synthesis/methylation, and the metabolism of FA {{is responsible for}} genomic stability. MicroRNAs may affect gene expression during folate metabolism when cellular homeostasis is changed. This study aimed to reveal the relationship between FA deficiency and the expression of miR- 22 -p/miR- 149 - 5 p and the targeted regulation of miR- 22 - 3 p/miR- 149 - 5 p on the key folate metabolic gene Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Normal (HL- 7702 cells) and cancerous (QGY- 7703 cells) human hepatocytes were intervened in modified RPMI 1640 with FA deficiency for 21 days. The interaction between MTHFR and the tested miRNAs was verified by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assays. The changes in the expression of miR- 22 - 3 p/miR- 149 - 5 p in response to FA deficiency were detected by <b>Poly</b> (<b>A)</b> <b>Tailing</b> RT-qPCR, and the expression of MTHFR at both the transcriptional and translational levels was determined by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, respectively. MiR- 22 - 3 p/miR- 149 - 5 p directly targeted the 3 'UTR sequence of the MTHFR gene. FA deficiency led to an upregulation of miR- 22 - 3 p/miR- 149 - 5 p expression in QGY- 7703 /HL- 7702 cells, while the transcription of MTHFR was decreased in QGY- 7703 cells but elevated in HL- 7702 cells. Western blotting showed that FA deficiency resulted in a decline of the MTHFR protein in QGY- 7703 cells, whereas in HL- 7702 cells, the MTHFR protein level remained constant. The results suggested that miR- 22 - 3 p/miR- 149 - 5 p exert different post-transcriptional effects on MTHFR under conditions of FA deficiency in normal and cancerous human hepatocytes. The results also implied that miR- 22 - 3 p/miR- 149 - 5 p might exert anticancer effects in cases of long-term FA deficiency...|$|R

In the present study, RT-PCR analysis of total RNA from both human normal and tumor cells revealed a novel 289 nucleotide splice variant of the TFPI- 2 transcript designated as aberrantly-spliced TFPI- 2 (asTFPI- 2). Results Nucleotide sequence analyses indicated that asTFPI- 2 consists of complete exons II and V, fused with several nucleotides derived from exons III and IV, as well as six nucleotides derived from intron C. 5 '- and 3 '-RACE analyses of total RNA amplified exclusively the wild-type TFPI- 2 transcript, indicating that asTFPI- 2 lacks either a 5 '-untranslated region (UTR) or a 3 '-poly (<b>A)</b> + <b>tail.</b> Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses revealed that several human tumor cells contain 4 to 50 -fold more copies of asTFPI- 2 in comparison to normal cells. In spite of the absence of a 5 '-UTR or <b>poly</b> (<b>A)</b> + <b>tail,</b> the asTFPI- 2 variant exhibited a half-life of ~ 16 h in tumor cells. Conclusion Our studies reveal the existence of a novel, aberrantly-spliced TFPI- 2 transcript predominantly expressed in tumor cells and provides suggestive evidence for an additional mechanism for tumor cells to down-regulate TFPI- 2 protein expression enhancing their ability to degrade the extracellular matrix. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGenome {{replication}} of plus-strand RNA viruses {{begins with the}} generation of a minus-strand copy of the genome. Minus-strand synthesis must initiate at or close to the 3 ′ end of the genome and progress to processive elongation to yield the appropriate template for genomic RNA synthesis. The Sindbis virus genome possesses a 3 ′ polyadenylate tail preceded by a 19 nucleotide conserved sequence element (3 ′ CSE).

We hypothesized that transcription from the corresponding promoters is important for this discrimination.

Development of a porcine germinal vesicle oocyte (GVO) to a 4 -cell stage embryo occurs during a transcriptionally silent period when the oocyte/embryo relies on maternally derived mRNA to encode proteins required for development. Regulation of translation and degradation of maternal mRNA is thought to be partially dependent upon cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) within the 3 ' untranslated region of the mRNA. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine how CPE sites affect the abundance of mRNA during embryogenesis and parthenogenetic development, and how cordycepin, a 3 '-deooxyadenosine (3 '-dA) which inhibits <b>poly</b> (<b>A)</b> <b>tail</b> formation, affects polyadenylation and transcript abundance. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from oocytes and 4 -cell stage embryos were scanned for the presence of five consensus CPEs. Nineteen different transcripts containing one to three putative CPEs were selected and transcript abundance was determined in GVO, metaphase II, 2 -cell and 4 -cell stage embryos via real-time PCR; and the length of the <b>poly</b> (<b>A)</b> <b>tail</b> was determined by using a <b>Poly</b> (<b>A)</b> <b>tail</b> PCR (PAT) assay.

There was no direct correlation between <b>poly</b> (<b>A)</b> <b>tail</b> length, transcript abundance and the CPE. Cordycepin prevented polyadenylation of transcripts that normally undergo noticeable polyadenylation. Thus CPEs may not be the only factors that regulate message stability, and parthenogenetic activation does not result in changes in transcript abundance that mimic in vitro fertilization...|$|E

The fact that the isolated cDNA clone ends with a <b>poly</b> <b>A</b> <b>tail</b> 20 nucleotides downstream from the LTR-IS AATAAA box {{and the result of}} the S 1 -nuclease mapping provides evidence that the 3 ' end of the mouse gene transcript was generated {{under the control of the}} LTR-IS polyadenylation signal...|$|E
40|$|Antibodies {{to native}} DNA and to polyadenylic acid (<b>Poly</b> <b>A)</b> occur spontaneously and undergo a {{regulated}} switch from IgM to IgG {{during the course}} of autoimmune disease in NZB/NZW F 1 (B/W) mice. B/W females have higher titers and earlier commitment to 7 S antibodies to DNA and <b>Poly</b> <b>A,</b> whereas B/W males bind DNA and <b>Poly</b> <b>A</b> primarily by 19 S antibodies. We have performed castration experiments {{to determine the effects of}} sex hormones on this switch from IgM to IgG...|$|R
