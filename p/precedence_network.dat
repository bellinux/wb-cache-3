40|$|In this paper, the {{resource}} allocation problem in multi-class dynamic PERT networks with finite capacity of concurrent projects (COnstant Number of Projects In Process (CONPIP)) is studied. The dynamic PERT network is modeled as a queuing network, where new projects from different classes (types) are generated according to independent Poisson processes with different rates {{over the time}} horizon. Each activity of a project is performed at a devoted service station with one server located in a node of the network, whereas activity durations for different classes in each service station are independent and exponentially distributed random variables with different service rates. Indeed, the projects from different classes may be different in their <b>precedence</b> <b>networks</b> and also the durations of the activities. For modeling the multi-class dynamic PERT networks with CONPIP, we first consider every class separately and convert the queueing network of every class into a proper stochastic network. Then, by constructing a proper finite-state continuous-time Markov model, a system of differential equations is created to compute the project completion time distribution for any particular project. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective model with three objectives to optimally control {{the resource}}s allocated to the service stations. Finally, we develop a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to solve this multi-objective problem, using the goal attainment formulation. We also compare the SA results against {{the results of a}} discrete-time approximation of the original optimal control problem, to show the effectiveness of the proposed solution technique...|$|R

40|$|Optimisation {{heuristics}} rely on implicit or explicit {{assumptions about}} {{the structure of the}} black-box fitness function they optimise. A review of the literature shows that understanding of structure and linkage is helpful to the design and analysis of heuristics. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the role that problem structure plays in heuristic optimisation. Many heuristics use ordinal operators; which are those that are invariant under monotonic transformations of the fitness function. In this thesis we develop a classification of pseudo-Boolean functions based on rank-invariance. This approach classifies functions which are monotonic transformations of one another as equivalent, and so partitions an infinite set of functions into a finite set of classes. Reasoning about heuristics composed of ordinal operators is, by construction, invariant over these classes. We perform a complete analysis of 2 -bit and 3 -bit pseudo-Boolean functions. We use Walsh analysis to define concepts of necessary, unnecessary, and conditionally necessary interactions, and of Walsh families. This helps to make precise some existing ideas in the literature such as benign interactions. Many algorithms are invariant under the classes we define, which allows us to examine the difficulty of pseudo-Boolean functions in terms of function classes. We analyse a range of ordinal selection operators for an EDA. Using a concept of directed ordinal linkage, we define <b>precedence</b> <b>networks</b> and <b>precedence</b> profiles to represent key algorithmic steps and their interdependency in terms of problem structure. The precedence profiles provide a measure of problem difficulty. This corresponds to problem difficulty and algorithmic steps for optimisation. This work develops insight into the relationship between function structure and problem difficulty for optimisation, which may be used to direct the development of novel algorithms.

40|$|The main {{achievement}} {{of this research}} is the development of a genetic algorithm model as a solution approach to the single model assembly line balancing problem (SMALBP), considered a difficult combinatorial optimisation problem. This is accomplished by developing a genetic algorithm with a new fitness function and genetic operators. The novel fitness function is based on a new front-loading concept capable of yielding substantially improved and sometimes optimum solutions for the SMALBP. The new genetic operators include a modified selection technique, moving crossover point technique, rank positional weight based repair method and dynamic mutation technique. The moving crossover point technique addressed the issue of propagating best attributes from parents to offspring and also supports the forward loading process. The new selection technique was developed by modifying the original rank-based selection scheme. This eliminates the high selective pressure associate with the original rank-based technique. Furthermore, the modified selection technique allows the algorithm to run long enough, if required, without premature convergence and this feature is very useful for balancing more complex real world problems. The repair technique included in this model repairs a higher proportion of distorted chromosomes after crossover than previous methods. Moreover, a third innovative feature, a moving adjacent mutation technique, strengthens the forward loading procedure and accelerates convergence. The performance of the front-loading fitness function currently outperforms the published fitness functions and fifty-four published test cases generated from sixteen <b>precedence</b> <b>networks</b> are used to assess the overall performance of the model. Encompassing the new genetic algorithm concepts, forty-four test problems (81 %) achieved the best solutions obtained by published techniques and twenty-four problems (44 %) produced better results than the benchmark Hoffmann precedence procedure, the closest non-genetic algorithm method. The superiority of the genetic model over other heuristics is identified in this research and future developments of this genetic algorithm application for assembly line balancing problems is evident...|$|R
