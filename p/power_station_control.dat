40|$|The central task in <b>power</b> <b>station</b> <b>control</b> is to {{meet the}} system demand while minimising state and input {{variations}} in the plant. In order to achieve good set-point following, the control system must {{make good use of}} coupling between the different control loops and if possible use information about future set points to smooth out the control activity. Characteristic generalised predictive control sets out to achieve both these objectives and hence would seem ideally suited to <b>power</b> <b>station</b> <b>control.</b> The presence of some fast and slow dynamics implies that the boiler-turbine system is in essence a stiff problem; the characteristic generalised predictive control (GPC) algorithm is suitably extended to take direct account of this. Simulation results show that the characteristic GPC algorithm (a) provides a systematic means of approaching the boiler-turbine problem and (b) affords some improvements in performance over traditional PID control schemes...|$|E

Intrinsically conceived to support the continuous provision of power in secure conditions, those systems make today intensive use of network based information and communication systems and are therefore exposed to the related accidental and intentional cyber–threats. This paper describes a simulation of intentional cyber–attacks conducted in the CESI laboratory testbed on a prototypical substation control infrastructure with the purpose of testing their feasibility and illustrating their impact on the control system services. A set of attack scenarios has been experimented in the testbed, targeting different subsystems, with different simulated threat motivations and different degrees of impact on the global substation service. The paper reports some considerations about the consequences of the implemented attacks, focusing on different facets of the problem, in an effort to elucidate the full significance of the potential cyber–threats. The simulated attack scenarios include the following cases: phishing, denial of services, viral infections and intrusions. JRC. G. 6 -Sensors, radar technologies and cybersecurit...|$|E

40|$|Computer {{simulations}} {{have been}} used to study the effect of narrow switched-beam transmission and power control at the base station on the interference characteristics and traffic capacity of digital cellular (IS- 136) systems. In simulations, four narrow beams in place of a sectored antenna pattern are used, and a power control mode with up to 30 watts maximum transmitted power is applied. Results indicate that with transmission on four narrow beams at the base station, the improvement in carrier to interference ratio (C/I) is more than 4 dB. Furthermore, with narrow beam transmission and the base <b>station</b> <b>power</b> <b>control,</b> the total improvement in C/I is 8 to 10 dB. If this C/I gain is utilized to maximize the amount of served traffic, the system capacity can be enhanced by more than 100 %.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Development and Management Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Nigeria is {{presently}} being {{faced with a}} growing electricity demand problem following its population growth rate. The total installed capacity is {{far less than the}} current demand for electricity supply. As a way of bridging out this supply gap, the federal government is mobilizing all of its potential energy options. Coal is widely used for power generation in many countries. But today, the continued usage of coal for power generation is being challenged by the disturbing global warming phenomenon. This is due to the quantity of uncontrolled carbon dioxide emission from traditional coal-fired power plants. The aim of this dissertation is to critically analyse the future of the Nigerian coal <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> following the need to do carbon dioxide emission control necessary for ensuring a sustainable environment. Achieving this aim entails the appraisal of environmental regulation standards and cost structures of carbon dioxide (C 02) emission reduction options for the coal <b>power</b> <b>stations.</b> <b>Controlling</b> carbon dioxide emission from existing coal <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> requires retrofit system that captures and effectively sequestrates the captured CO 2. The cost and performance effect of the CO 2 retrofit system on the existing power plant can be simulated with standard computer software models. In this study the lECM-cs computer modelling tool for power plants was used in determining the cost and performance impacts of applying an Amine-based C 02 capture system to the Oji river <b>power</b> <b>station</b> in Nigeria. With the lECM-cs model, it was established that reducing C 02 emission imposes an additional cost on the power plant which increases the unit cost of electricity generated. This additional cost index requires economic justification for its acceptance. This is due to the need to demonstrate its viability judging from the cost of electricity generated from other sources in the Nigerian economy. For the Oji river case, the station is old and requires extensive renovation. This causes a cost escalation over and above the cost associated with the CO 2 sequestration system. As such, Oji coal <b>power</b> <b>station</b> does not have an economic future if C 02 emission sequestration becomes obligatory. The future of coal <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> in Nigeria can be considered from two scenarios: one where the current national environmental standard is retained and another where it is revised. The revision classifies CO 2 as a pollutant which makes its emission reduction imperative for coal power plants. Under the current standard, building modern large capacity pulverized coal-fired power plants with improved steam cycles should be encouraged. But with the review of the national standard, the focus should be on building new large capacity coal <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> with integrated CO 2 emission control. This will ensure an environmentally friendly future for coal <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> in Nigeria. Master...|$|R
