5|$|In {{the top of}} the box was a hole <b>perhaps</b> <b>an</b> inch in diameter. As {{they looked}} through the hole they saw the picture of a man. It was a most {{marvelous}} picture. It bowed and smiled and waved its hands and took off its hat with the most perfect naturalness and grace. Every motion was perfect....|$|E
5|$|The {{availability}} of criminal {{appeals to the}} Supreme Court by means of writs of error from the circuit courts was <b>perhaps</b> <b>an</b> open question prior to More. In England, the writ of error was available as of right in misdemeanor cases, but, in felony cases, required the express consent of the prosecutor.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the Giant, the {{earthworks}} {{belong to}} Lord Digby, {{rather than the}} National Trust. Its purpose is unknown, though it {{is thought to be}} the site of maypole dancing. It has been considered to be Roman, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>an</b> Iron-Age burial mound containing the tomb of the person represented by the Giant.|$|E
5|$|A large workhouse such as Whitechapel, {{accommodating}} {{several thousand}} paupers, employed {{a staff of}} almost 200; the smallest may only have had a porter and <b>perhaps</b> <b>an</b> assistant nurse {{in addition to the}} master and matron. A typical workhouse accommodating 225 inmates had a staff of five, which included a part-time chaplain and a part-time medical officer. The low pay meant that many medical officers were young and inexperienced. To add to their difficulties, in most unions they were obliged to pay out of their own pockets for any drugs, dressings or other medical supplies needed to treat their patients.|$|E
5|$|According to Tough, an {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{might want}} to send various types of information to humanity by means of artifacts, such as an Encyclopædia Galactica, containing the wisdom of countless extraterrestrial cultures, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>an</b> invitation to engage in diplomacy with them. A civilization that sees itself {{on the brink of}} decline might use the abilities it still possesses to send probes throughout the galaxy, with its cultures, values, religions, sciences, technologies, and laws, so that they may not die along with their civilization.|$|E
5000|$|Buddhist devas are not immortal. They {{live for}} very long but finite periods of time, ranging from {{thousands}} to (at least) billions of years. When they pass away, they are reborn as some other sort of being, <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> different type of deva, <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> human or something beyond comprehension.|$|R

5|$|The British, Americans and Soviet Union {{discussed}} the proposal. British Foreign Secretary (later Prime Minister) Anthony Eden wrote a memo on 26 June outlining the options. The British were convinced {{they were dealing}} with a Himmler trick, <b>perhaps</b> <b>an</b> attempt to broker a peace deal without the Soviet Union. If the deal had gone ahead and large numbers of Jews had been released in central Europe, Allied airborne and possibly land-based military operations might have had to stop. Bauer believes the British feared this was Himmler's motive– to turn the Jews into human shields– because it would have allowed the Germans to devote their forces to fighting the Red Army.|$|E
5|$|Borchgrevink's {{expedition}} objectives comprised commercial, {{scientific and}} geographical goals. He considered forming {{a company to}} exploit the extensive guano deposits that he had observed during his 1894–95 voyage, but this came to nothing. In numerous addresses to scientific societies, he stressed the extent of work that could {{be carried out by}} a resident expedition, including the possibility of establishing the location of the South Magnetic Pole. The team of scientists that Borchgrevink appointed, though inexperienced, covered a wide range of disciplines—magnetism, meteorology, biology, zoology, taxidermy and cartography. Borchgrevink also hoped that the expedition's scientific achievements could be matched by spectacular geographical discoveries and journeys, even <b>perhaps</b> <b>an</b> attempt on the geographical South Pole itself. With no knowledge of the continent's geography, he was unaware that the site of the base at Cape Adare would rule out any serious exploration of the Antarctic interior.|$|E
5|$|The Parthian Empire had no {{standing}} army, yet {{were able}} to quickly recruit troops {{in the event of}} local crises. There was a permanent armed guard attached to the person of the king, comprising nobles, serfs and mercenaries, but this royal retinue was small. Garrisons were also permanently maintained at border forts; Parthian inscriptions reveal some of the military titles granted to the commanders of these locations. Military forces could also be used in diplomatic gestures. For example, when Chinese envoys visited Parthia in the late 2nd century BC, the Shiji maintains that 20,000 horsemen were sent to the eastern borders to serve as escorts for the embassy, although this figure is <b>perhaps</b> <b>an</b> exaggeration.|$|E

5|$|Buczynski's {{continuing}} {{disagreements with}} {{senior members of}} the CES led him to resign from the priesthood on August 1, 1975. The New York Temple that he had led subsequently folded. Returning his interest to Wicca, he befriended a Gardnerian high priestess named Sheila Saperton, who had been initiated into the Craft years before by Raymond Buckland. Saperton had become increasingly interested in Buckland's newly developed tradition of Seax-Wica, and founded a Seax coven from her home in Huntington Station on Long Island. Although never initiated into Seax-Wica, Buczynksi associated with the group, and attended many of their rites. Eventually however, the group tired of the practices of Seax-Wica, and instead transformed into a Gardnerian coven, with Buczynski becoming high priest. Claiming that a mysterious witch known only as Jana, who had been involved in the New Forest coven back in Hampshire, England, had been communicating with him and providing him with a legitimate lineage, he began making further changes to the coven structure. Both Buczynski biographer Michael Lloyd and researcher Philip Heselton have expressed doubt that Jana was ever a real figure operating in England, instead suggesting that she was <b>perhaps</b> <b>an</b> invention of Buczynski's to legitimize his practice of Gardnerian Wica.|$|E
5|$|Tradition {{would have}} made his brother Domnall Bán Máel Coluim's successor, {{but it seems that}} Edward, his eldest son by Margaret, was his chosen heir. With Máel Coluim and Edward dead in the same battle, and his other sons in Scotland still young, Domnall was made king. However, Donnchad II, Máel Coluim's eldest son by his first wife, {{obtained}} some support from William Rufus and took the throne. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle his English and French followers were massacred, and Donnchad II himself was killed later in the same year (1094) by Domnall's ally Máel Petair of Mearns. In 1097, William Rufus sent another of Máel Coluim's sons, Edgar, to take the kingship. The ensuing death of Domnall Bán secured the kingship for Edgar, and there followed a period of relative peace. The reigns of both Edgar and his successor Alexander are obscure by comparison with their successors. The former's most notable act was to send a camel (or <b>perhaps</b> <b>an</b> elephant) to his fellow Gael Muircheartach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland. When Edgar died, Alexander took the kingship, while his youngest brother David became Prince of Cumbria.|$|E

25|$|There are {{at least}} two {{components}} of economic development: debt relief and new development. Most of the debt relief activity will be by nonmilitary personnel, other than <b>perhaps</b> <b>an</b> occasional audit. New development, however, can involve engineering and other relevant military skills.|$|E
25|$|The Yorkshireman was magnificent. This was not <b>perhaps</b> <b>an</b> innings to be {{compared}} with his Brisbane classic, but it was, nevertheless, batsmanship sublime, worth first a hundred and then 150, with off drives, late cuts, hooks and leg glances, all performed with that easy composure so completely the Yorkshireman's own.|$|E

The beaches at Kızkalesi, Ayaş, Susanoğlu (app. 50–70km west) are popular with {{families}} while young people prefer Akyar, Yapraklı koy, Narlıkuyu or quieter bays along the coast, some of which are very attractive indeed.|$|E
25|$|Van Gogh painted Gachet {{resting his}} right elbow {{on a red}} table, head in hand. Two yellow books {{as well as the}} purple {{medicinal}} herb foxglove are displayed on the table. The foxglove in the painting is a plant from which digitalis is extracted for the treatment of certain heart complaints, <b>perhaps</b> <b>an</b> attribute of Gachet as a physician.|$|E

Line drivers are a type of buffer that feeds long or interference-prone interconnect cables, possibly with differential outputs through twisted pair cables.|$|E
