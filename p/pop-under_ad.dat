50|$|A <b>pop-under</b> <b>ad</b> {{involves}} two JavaScript functions {{introduced in}} 1997 with the Netscape 2.0B3 browser. Modern web publishers and advertisers {{use it to}} create a window {{in front of the}} users screen, load an advertisement, and then send it behind the screen.|$|E
5000|$|A {{pop-up ad}} is {{displayed}} in a new web browser window that opens above a website visitor's initial browser window. A <b>pop-under</b> <b>ad</b> opens a new browser window under a website visitor's initial browser window. Pop-under ads and similar technologies are now advised against by online authorities such as Google, who state that they [...] "do not condone this practice".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pop-under</b> <b>ads</b> {{are similar}} to pop-up ads, but the ad window appears hidden behind the main browser window rather than {{superimposed}} in front of it. As pop-up ads became widespread and took up whole computer screens, many users learned to immediately close the popup ads that appeared over a site without looking at them. <b>Pop-under</b> <b>ads</b> do not immediately impede the view of content, but remain unnoticed until the user closes or minimizes the main browser window.|$|R
5000|$|To bypass this restriction, most <b>pop-under</b> <b>ads</b> trigger on a mouse click event {{listener}} attached {{directly to}} the document or the document's body. This enables catching all mouse click events that were not consumed by other click event handlers, and calling [...] without being blocked. For example, when the user selects a text, the mouse click triggers the mouse click handler attached to the document and a pop-under opens using the above code. Notice {{that there are more}} techniques to bypass the [...] call restriction by [...] "hijacking" [...] mouse clicks.|$|R
5000|$|Zedo (trademark styled as ZEDO) is {{a privately}} held company founded in 1999 by Roy de Souza, which {{provides}} several online advertising {{products and services}} to Internet publishers, advertisers, and agencies. The company works with publishers who sell space on their web pages to online advertisers. Zedo's servers send advertisements to users' browsers. [...] Zedo uses an HTTP cookie to track users' browsing history resulting in targeted pop-up <b>ad</b> and <b>pop-under</b> <b>ads.</b> The cookie is often flagged by spyware and adware removal programs.

50|$|Minimal {{advertising}} budget should be five thousand rubles, the website should not contain <b>pop-under</b> (click-under) <b>ads,</b> erotic materials, viruses or other malicious scripts, the content must be unique {{and the site}} cannot be on a free hosting service.|$|R
50|$|Multiple reviewers {{have criticized}} Zeobit's {{marketing}} and promotional techniques. Kromtech buys upwards of 60 million ad impressions a month, {{making it one}} of the largest buyers of web traffic aimed at Mac users. Zeobit has been accused of employing misleading advertising with regard to its promotion of MacKeeper, including aggressive affiliate marketing, <b>pop-under</b> <b>ads</b> and planting sockpuppet reviews as well as websites set up to discredit their competitors. Some MacKeeper advertisements pose as online malware scanners claiming to have found malware on a user's computer and prompting the user to download a removal tool, which is actually the MacKeeper setup wizard (a technique often used by rogue security software). Kromtech has also had issues with affiliate advertisers, attracted by the 50 percent commissions Kromtech pays for sales of MacKeeper, who've wrapped MacKeeper ads into adware.|$|R
50|$|A Unicast {{advertisement}} is an Internet advertisement {{that consists}} of a video played like a TV commercial, usually in a pop-up or <b>pop-under</b> advertisement. Unicast <b>ads</b> have the same influence and power as a regular TV commercial, except they allow the viewer to click on the ad {{in order to go}} to the company's website, or get more information.|$|R
40|$|Pop-up, <b>pop-under,</b> and in-line <b>ads</b> {{have been}} said to be intrusive, and {{previous}} findings suggest {{that they could have}} important effects on user perception and cognition. Using a 2 x 2 factorial design, this experimental study examines the effects of those ads. Besides a control group without ads, factors included ad placement (pop-up vs inline) and ad congruence (with the site's content or not). Results indicated that intention to return was impaired by ads; retention of website information was higher when ads were inline or when ads were not congruent with website content; and retention of ad content was higher for inline ads and those that were not congruent to the content of the website. However, contrary to expectations, intentions to return were not affected by ad placement, retention of sit...|$|R
