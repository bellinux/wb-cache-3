50|$|Before 1928 only prisoners or {{very poor}} people {{could apply to}} the Supreme Court for <b>legal</b> <b>aid.</b> In 1928 the {{government}} set up the Public Solicitor's Office to make <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> more easily available.

50|$|Waitangi Tribunal {{claims have}} been a {{contributing}} factor to the growing cost of <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> as Treaty claimants can apply for <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> irrespective of their financial circumstances - {{which is not the}} case in civil or criminal cases. Since 2006, Waitangi tribunal cases have cost the taxpayer $79 million in <b>legal</b> <b>aid,</b> although as at January 2013, there were 780 claims still outstanding.

40|$|This research, {{carried out}} by a <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> lawyer with the governmentâ€™s <b>Legal</b> <b>Aid</b> Directorate, seeks to {{highlight}} the various challenges which are faced by indigent women as they access justice through the <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> system. The main {{focus is on the}} <b>Legal</b> <b>Aid</b> Directorate as the main legal services provider since it is the task of the government to provide its citizens with <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> services. The Directorate falls under the Ministry of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs. This study was conducted using four methodologies, namely, the womenâ€™s law approach, grounded theory, human rights approach and the sex and gender approach. Each methodology assisted in revealing the full context of the barriers which prevent indigent women from accessing justice and they also revealed the effectiveness of the current <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> services offered by both the government and NGOs. The human rights based approach was useful in measuring the extent of the stateâ€™s compliance with international instruments. The right to <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> is fundamental in promoting and advancing womenâ€™s access to justice. Although the Zimbabwean Constitution provides for <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> as a national objective under section 31, women are finding <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> inaccessible and unaffordable because they fail to meet the legal expenses involved in obtaining <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> services. There is a need to exempt indigent women from paying any court fees or costs related to the issuing and service of legal process as these costs defeat the whole purpose of offering <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> services to indigent women. Current laws on <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> have to be monitored and evaluated so that existing legislation is properly implemented. This will result in women benefiting from a <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> system which should offer effective solutions to their problems. The concept of having a revolving fund is a welcome development as this will offer financial assistance to indigent clients.,NORA...|$|R
5000|$|By way of history, the Australian Government {{established}} the Legal Services Bureaux in 1942 {{to develop a}} national system. In 1973 the Attorney-General in the Whitlam Labor government, Lionel Murphy, {{established the}} Australian <b>Legal</b> <b>Aid</b> Office. Murphy recognised {{the urgent need for}} <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> in order for justice to be equally available for all. Murphy recognised that: [...] "one of the basic causes of the inequality of citizens before the laws is the absence of adequate and comprehensive <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> arrangements throughout Australia ... The ultimate object of the Government is that <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> be readily and equally available to citizens everywhere in Australia and that aid be extended for advice and assistance of litigation as well as for litigation in all legal categories and in all courts." [...] (Senator the Hon Lionel Murphy AO QC, Attorney General) The establishment of the Australian <b>Legal</b> <b>Aid</b> Office in 1973 was followed by the establishment of state-based <b>Legal</b> <b>Aid</b> Commissions. These offices now provide the majority of free or lowcost legal assistance to those in need. In 1977, the Australian Government enacted the Commonwealth <b>Legal</b> <b>Aid</b> Commission Act 1977 (LAC Act), which established cooperative arrangements between the Australian Government and state and territory governments, under which <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> would be provided by independent <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> commissions to be established under state and territory legislation. The process of establishing the LACs took more than a decade. It commenced in 1976 with the establishment of the <b>Legal</b> <b>Aid</b> Commission of Western Australia, followed in 1978 the <b>Legal</b> <b>Aid</b> Commission of Victoria (LACV), and ended in 1990 with the establishment of the <b>Legal</b> <b>Aid</b> Commission of Tasmania.
