So, establishing environment <b>personality</b> <b>right</b> becomes an issue concerned by the legal circle. Beyond all doubt, {{it is necessary to}} establish environment <b>personality</b> <b>right,</b> but it is required to fully consider the constraints to establish environment <b>personality</b> <b>right,</b> protect people’s environment <b>personality</b> <b>right</b> and solve environmental crisis from legal perspective. This paper mainly explores the necessity and constraints of establishing environment <b>personality</b> <b>right</b> and provides certain reference for establishing environment <b>personality</b> <b>right...</b>|$|R

500|$|Copyright law, {{throughout}} its history, {{has sought to}} protect not only the financial interests of the authors but also their <b>personality</b> <b>rights.</b> Evolving from the French droit moral, moral rights protect the personality and reputation of the copyrighted work's author. Under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, providing protection for moral rights is a requisite part of member states' legal systems. The actual rights provided vary from nation to nation; French law treats moral rights as supreme and perpetual, and German law gives both moral and economic rights the same weighting, but the British legal system has traditionally [...] "manifested a certain scepticism towards claims that authors deserve special protection in law", and until the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, there was little protection. Even {{with the passage of}} the 1988 Act, academics still debate over how far the rights should go.|$|E
50|$|The {{plaintiff}} {{must prove}} the infringement of the <b>personality</b> <b>right.</b> Then {{the court will}} presume that the infringement was wrongful and intentional (but it {{is open to the}} defendant to prove otherwise: rebutting presumptions of wrongfulness and intention, usually by proving a defence).|$|R
50|$|Again, the wrongfulness {{element is}} the same as that under the Aquilian action. The test is one of {{objective}} reasonableness.

She was cast as a glamorous journalist reporting on a British Home Guard platoon based in Walmington-on-Sea. Catherine Bray of Variety found the film to be an [...] "amiable but creaky resurrection" [...] of the popular sitcom, and thought that while Zeta-Jones [...] "hits the required single note with some spirit" [...] she was [...] "generally underused" [...] in it. Zeta-Jones returned to television the following year by portraying the actress Olivia de Havilland in the first season of Ryan Murphy's anthology drama series Feud, subtitled Bette and Joan, about the rivalry between the actresses Joan Crawford and Bette Davis (played by Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon, respectively). Dominic Patten of Deadline.com found Zeta-Jones to be [...] "wonderfully cast" [...] and Sonia Saraiya of Variety praised her for providing [...] "the best turn in the show".

40|$|TITLE: Sound and Audiovisual Records as an Evidence in Civil Proceedings AUTHOR: Ivo Petržílek DEPARTMENT: Department of Civil law SUPERVISOR: doc. JUDr. Alena Macková, Ph. D. ABSTRACT: The thesis {{deals with}} the {{problems}} of inadmissibility of evidence by the audio and video recordings in civil proceedings. Attention is focused mainly on problems of using illegally obtained records as proofs. Diploma searches for the solution to the contemporary course which seems to be ineffectual. The thesis is divided into six chapters. The first and second chapters introduce the theoretical basis of proving in civil proceedings. The third chapter refers to the evidence by the sound and audiovisual records in the area of civil proceedings and {{deals with the}} main factors of its potential proving use. In the fourth chapter author deals with the collision of basic rights and interests, especially with the general <b>personality</b> <b>right</b> and the interest of effective Justice and proposes a Proportionality test as the solution. The fifth chapter contains a comparison of the Czech and German case law. Finally, the last, sixth chapter summarizes the most important findings and concludes the thesis.
