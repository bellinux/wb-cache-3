50|$|Pipes are {{commonly}} joined by welding, using threaded pipe and fittings; sealing {{the connection with}} a <b>pipe</b> <b>thread</b> compound, Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Thread seal tape, oakum, or PTFE string, or by using a mechanical coupling. Process piping is usually joined by welding using a TIG or MIG process. The most common process pipe joint is the butt weld. The ends of pipe to be welded must have a certain weld preparation called an End Weld Prep (EWP) which is typically at an angle of 37.5 degrees to accommodate the filler weld metal. The most common <b>pipe</b> <b>thread</b> in North America is the National <b>Pipe</b> <b>Thread</b> (NPT) or the Dryseal (NPTF) version.

5000|$|In 1969, Bob Gore was researching {{a process}} for {{stretching}} extruded PTFE into <b>pipe</b> <b>thread</b> tape when he discovered that the polymer could be [...] "expanded" [...] into a porous form of PTFE, characterized by extremely high strength and porosity. He and others had attempted to stretch rods of PTFE by about 10%. His discovery of the right conditions for stretching PTFE was a happy accident, born partly of frustration. Instead of slowly stretching the heated material, he applied a sudden, accelerating yank. The solid PTFE unexpectedly stretched about 800%, forming a microporous structure that was about 70% air.|$|E

5000|$|Thread {{seal tape}} (also known as PTFE tape or plumber's tape) is a {{polytetrafluoroethylene}} (PTFE) film {{for use in}} sealing <b>pipe</b> <b>threads.</b> The tape is sold cut to specific widths and wound on a spool, {{making it easy to}} wind around <b>pipe</b> <b>threads.</b> It is also known by the genericised trade-name Teflon tape; while Teflon is in fact identical to PTFE, Chemours (the trade-mark holders) consider this usage incorrect, especially as they no longer manufacture Teflon in tape form. Thread seal tape lubricates allowing for a deeper seating of the threads, and it helps prevent the threads from seizing when being unscrewed. The tape also works as a deformable filler and thread lubricant, helping to seal the joint without hardening or making it more difficult to tighten, and instead making it easier to tighten.|$|R
