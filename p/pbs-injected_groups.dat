40|$|Cisplatin {{is used as}} {{a potent}} anticancer drug, but it often causes nephrotoxicity. Bee venom (BV) has been used for the {{treatment}} of various inflammatory diseases, and its renoprotective action was shown in NZB/W mice. However, little is known about whether BV has beneficial effects on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and how such effects might be mediated. In the present study, the BV-injected group showed {{a significant increase in the}} population of Tregs in spleen. Although there was no significant difference in the numbers of Tregs 3 days after cisplatin injection between the BV- and <b>PBS-injected</b> <b>groups,</b> more migration of Tregs into the kidney was observed 6 hours after cisplatin administration in BV group than in PBS group. In addition, BV-injected mice showed reduced levels of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, renal tissue damage, proinflammatory cytokines, and macrophage infiltration into the kidney 3 days after cisplatin administration. These renoprotective effects were abolished by the depletion of Tregs. The anticancer effect of repeated administrations of cisplatin was not affected by BV injection. These results suggest that BV has protective effects on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in mice, at least in part, through the regulation of Tregs without a big influence on the antitumor effects of cisplatin...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Vocal fold (VF) {{scarring}} {{remains a}} therapeutic challenge. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) facilitates epithelial wound healing, and recently, growth factor therapy {{has been applied}} to promote tissue repair. This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of GM-CSF on VF wound healing in vivo and in vitro. Methods: VF scarring was induced in New Zealand white rabbits by direct injury. Immediately thereafter, either GM-CSF or PBS was injected into the VFs of rabbits. Endoscopic, histopathological, immunohistochemical, and biomechanical evaluations of VFs were performed at 3 months post-injury. Human vocal fold fibroblasts (hVFFs) were cultured with GM-CSF. Production of type I and III collagen was examined immunocytochemically, and the synthesis of elastin and hyaluronic acids was evaluated by ELISA. The mRNA levels of genes related to ECM components and ECM production-related growth factors, such as HGF and TGF-ß 1, were examined by real time RT-PCR. Results: The GM-CSF-treated VFs showed reduced collagen deposition in comparison to the PBS-injected controls (P, 0. 05). Immunohistochemical staining revealed lower amounts of type I collagen and fibronectin in the GM-CSF-treated VFs (P, 0. 05 and P, 0. 01, respectively). Viscous and elastic shear moduli of VF samples were significantly lower in the GM-CSF group than in the <b>PBS-injected</b> <b>group</b> (P, 0. 001 and P, 0. 01, respectively). Mucosal waves in the GM-CSF group showed significant improvement when compared to the PBS group (P = 0. 0446). GM-CSF inhibited TGF-b 1 -induced collage...|$|R
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the conversion rate of formic and acetic acids into methane in the gastrointestinal tracts of geese. In experiment 1, two sets of two 4 -month-old male White Roman geese were allocated {{to one of two}} treatment groups. Each set of geese was inoculated either with formic acid or with phosphate buffer solution (PBS). After the acid or the PBS was inoculated into the esophagi of the geese, two birds from each treatment were placed in a respiratory chamber as a measurement unit for 4 h in order to determine methane production rate. In experiment II and III, 6 - and 7 -wk-old male White Roman goslings were used, respectively. Birds were allocated to receive either formic acid or PBS solution injected into the ceca in experiment II. Acetic acid or PBS solution injected into the cecum were used for experiment III. After either the acids or the PBS solution were injected into the cecum, two birds from each treatment were placed in a respiratory chamber as a measurement unit for 3 h; each treatment was repeated 3 times. The results indicated that formic acid inoculated into the oesophagi of geese was quickly converted into methane. Compared with the <b>PBS-injected</b> <b>group,</b> methane production increased by 5. 02 times in the formic acid injected group (4. 32 vs. 0. 86 mg/kg BW/d; p< 0. 05). Acetic acid injected into the ceca did not increase methane production; conversely, it tended to decrease methane production. The present study suggests that formic acid may be converted to methane in the ceca, and that acetic acid may not be a precursor of methane in the ceca of geese...|$|R
40|$|Effects of Prunella vulgaris {{labiatae}} extract {{on specific}} and non-specific immune responses in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) Kwan-Ha Park and Sanghoon Choi* We {{examined the effects}} of Prunella vulgaris Labiatae (P. vulgaris L.) on specific and non-specific immune responses of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. The optimal concentration without toxicity of P. vulgaris was determined to 30 - 40 μg/ml in vitro and 120 μg/ 100 g of fish in vivo. P. vulgaris significantly elicited an antibody titer compared to FCA or β-glucan. β-glucan plus P. vulgaris group synergistically enhanced antibody production. No significant difference in antibody production was observed between P. vulgaris and P. vulgaris plus β-glucan group. A respiratory burst activity of head kidney (HK) leucocytes of tilapia administered with 300 or 500 μg P. vulgaris was significantly (p < 0. 05) enhanced compared with the <b>PBS-injected</b> control <b>group</b> and FCA-treated group. Maximum increase in the NBT reduction value was observed in 500 μg P. vulgaris group but no significant difference was found between 300 and 500 μg P. vulgaris group. The level of serum lysozyme activity was significantly (p < 0. 05) higher in the 300 and 500 μg P. vulgaris than 100 μg P. vulgaris and FCA group. The phagocytic activities of HK leucocytes from tilapia administered with 300 and 500 μg P. vulgaris were significantly (p < 0. 05) higher than 100 μg P. vulgaris and the control group. P. vulgaris was revealed with a good immunoadjuvant evoking the specific and non-specific immune responses of tilapia...|$|R
40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) is an autoimmune disease involving many organ systems. Glomerulonephritis (GLN) {{is one of}} the major causes of morbidity and mortality in SLE. It has recently been demonstrated that adjuvants of vaccines could cause the so called ASIA syndrome. The study aimed to assess the effects of Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA) vs alum injections in NZB/NZWF 1 mice. Mice (n= 10 each group) were injected with a total volume of 200 μL of: CFA in PBS (group 1), alum in PBS (group 2), PBS (group 3) as controls, PTX 3 /CFA (group 4), PTX 3 /alum (group 5), 3 times, 3 weeks apart /given in each injection, three weeks apart from ten weeks of age. Urine samples were collected weekly to evaluate proteinuria. Blood samples were collected before every injection, at 21 weeks of age, and at death to evaluate levels of anti-PTX 3 and anti-dsDNA. Proteinuria free survival and survival rates were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method using Mantel-Cox’s test for comparisons. CFA-treated mice developed both anti-dsDNA antibodies and proteinuria earlier and at higher levels than alumtreated and PBS-injected mice, starting from 13 weeks of age. Proteinuria free survival rates (proteinuria ≥ 300 mg/dL) and survival rates were lower in CFA-treated mice than those treated with alum or injected with PBS (P< 0. 001 for all). No difference was observed between the alum-treated <b>group</b> and <b>PBS-injected</b> mice. Notably, <b>groups</b> 4 and 5, immunized with PTX 3, developed anti-PTX 3 antibodies and no significant difference was observed. Alum seems to be as effective as and safer than CFA as adjuvant, since it did not affect disease progression in immunized NZB/NZWF 1 mice...|$|R
