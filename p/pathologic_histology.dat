40|$|Introduction: The staging {{system for}} {{malignant}} pleural mesothelioma is controversial. To revise this system, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Staging Committee developed an international database. This report analyzes prognostic variables in a surgical population, which are supplementary to previously published CORE variables (stage, histology, sex, age, {{and type of}} procedure). Methods: Supplementary prognostic variables were studied in three scenarios: (1) all data available, that is, patient pathologically staged and other CORE variables available (2) only clinical staging available along with CORE variables, and (3) only age, sex, histology, and laboratory parameters are known. Survival was analyzed by Kaplan– Meier, prognostic factors by log rank and stepwise Cox regression modeling after elimination of nonsignificant variables. p value less than 0. 05 was significant. Results: A total of 2141 patients with best tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) stages (pathologic with/without clinical staging) had nonmissing age, sex, histology, and type of surgical procedure. Three prognostic models were defined. Scenario A (all parameters) : best <b>pathologic</b> stage, <b>histology,</b> sex, age, type of surgery, adjuvant treatment, {{white blood cell count}} (WBC) (≥ 15. 5 or not), and platelets (≥ 400 k or not) (n = 550).

MethodsFifty Wistar rats were selected and randomly divided into three groups, with 20 rats in Group I and II, respectively and 10 animals in Group III. ALI model was constructed by intratracheal injection of diluted hydrochloric acid (pH= 1. 25, 1. 2 mL/kg). Group I rats received not any treatment after construction of ALI model. Group II rats were treated with captopril (5 mg/kg, i. p.) 5 min after induction of ALI. Group III served as normal control without any treatment. Ninety minutes after construction of ALI model, all the rats were sacrificed. Blood was withdrawn for detection of TNF-α level and arterial blood gases index. And lung tissue slices {{of the three groups}} were prepared for observation of <b>pathologic</b> <b>histology</b> changes. ResultsTNF-α level in serum of Group I and II rats was significantly higher than that in Group III (P< 0. 05), while TNF-α level in serum of Group II was significantly lower in Group I (P< 0. 05). PaCO 2 level was significantly higher (P< 0. 05), while PaO 2 was significantly lower (P< 0. 05) in Group I and II rats than those in Group III. PaCO 2 was significantly lower (P< 0. 05) and PaO 2 was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in Group II than those in Group I. Histological observation showed diffuse congestion and severe edema of lung tissue, obvious thickening and structure damage of alveolar walls and a large amount of neutrophil infiltration in Group I rats. Group II rats showed mild edema of lung tissue; {{only a small portion of}} alveolar walls showed thickening and only a few of neutrophil infiltration could be observed. The degree of injury was remarkably slighter than that of Group I rats. Group III rats showed clear lung tissue structure and normal morphology; alveolar walls were uniform and the margin was smooth and few neutrophil could be observed. ConclusionsCaptopril can significantly reduce serum TNF-α level, elevate PaO 2 and reduce PaCO 2 in rats with ALI. It has a protective effect on ALI rats...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{observe the}} {{antitumor}} effect and mechanism of recombinant human endostatin (Endostar) injection in tumor combined with intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin on subcutaneous transplanted Lewis lung cancer in rats. MethodsA total of 30 C 57 rats were selected, and the monoplast suspension of Lewis lung cancer was {{injected into the}} left axilla to prepare the subcutaneous transplanted tumor models in the axilla of right upper limb. The models were randomly divided into Groups A, B, and C. Medication was conducted when the tumor grew to 400  mm 3. Group A was the control group without any interventional treatment. Group B was injected with Endostar 5  mg kg− 1  d− 1 for 10  d. Group C was given the injection of Endostar 5  mg kg− 1  d− 1 combined with intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin 5  mg kg− 1  d− 1 for 10  d. All the rats in three groups were executed {{the day after the}} 10 d medication and the tumor was taken off for measurement of volume and mass changes and calculation of antitumor rate, after which the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentration in rats' plasma was determined by ELISA. The tumor tissues were cut for the preparation of conventional biopsies. After hematoxylin-eosin staining, the <b>pathologic</b> <b>histology</b> was examined to observe the structures of tumor tissues, VEGF score and microvessel density (MVD) in each group. ResultsThe volume and mass of tumor in Groups B and C were significantly lower than Group A (P <  0. 05) while the tumor volume and mass in Group C were significantly lower than Group B (P <  0. 05). The antitumor rate in Group C was significantly higher than Group B (P <  0. 05), but the tumor VEGF score, MVD and plasma VEGF level in Group C were significantly lower than Groups A and B (P <  0. 05). In Group B, the tumor VEGF score, MVD and plasma VEGF level were significantly lower than Group A (P <  0. 05). The microscopic image of Group C showed that its number of active tumor cells and the blood capillary around tumor was significantly smaller than that of Groups A and B, and meanwhile atrophy and liquefactive necrosis were seen in local tumor.

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by the American Society of Parasitologists {{and can be}} found at: [URL] are conducting studies on the impacts of parasites on Oregon coastal coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kistuch). An essential first step is documenting the geographic distribution of infections, which may be accomplished by using different methods for parasite detection. Thus, the objectives of the current study were to (1) identify parasite species infecting these stocks of coho salmon and document their prevalence, density, and geographic distribution; (2) assess the pathology of these infections; and (3) for the first time, determine the sensitivity and specificity of histology for detecting parasites compared with examining wet preparations for muscle and gill infections. We examined 576 fry, parr, and smolt coho salmon in total by histology. The muscle and gills of 219 of these fish also were examined by wet preparation. Fish were collected from 10 different locations in 2006 – 2007. We identified 21 different species of parasites in these fish. Some parasites, such as Nanophyetus salmincola and Myxobolus insidiosus, were common across all fish life stages from most basins. Other parasites, such as Apophallus sp., were more common in underyearling fish than smolts and had a more restricted geographic distribution. Additional parasites commonly observed were as follows: Sanguinicola sp., Trichodina truttae, Epistylis sp., Capriniana piscium, and unidentified metacercariae in gills; Myxobolus sp. in brain; Myxidium salvelini and Chloromyxum majori in kidney; Pseudocapillaria salvelini and adult digenean spp. in the intestine. Only a few parasites, such as the unidentified gill metacercariae, elicted overt <b>pathologic</b> changes. <b>Histology</b> had generally poor sensitivity for detecting parasites; however, it had relatively good specificity.

40|$|ObjectivesPositron {{emission}} tomographic maximal standardized {{uptake value}} {{has been shown}} to predict survival after resection of non–small cell lung cancer. The relative prognostic benefit of maximal standardized uptake value with respect to other clinical/pathologic variables has not been defined. MethodsWe reviewed patients who had positron emission tomographic imaging and an R 0 resection for non–small cell lung cancer between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2004, without induction or adjuvant therapy. The associations between overall survival, <b>histology,</b> <b>pathologic</b> TNM stage, pathologic tumor diameter, and standardized uptake value were tested. ResultsFour hundred eighty-seven patients met the study criteria. Median follow-up was 25. 8 months. By using the median values for tumor size (2. 5 cm) and standardized uptake value (5. 3), standardized uptake value was an independent predictor of survival (P =. 03), adjusting for tumor size (P =. 02) and histology (P <. 01). The optimal standardized uptake value for stratification was identified as 4. 4, and this value was identified as an independent predictor of survival (P =. 03) after adjusting for clinical TNM stage. Standardized uptake value was not an independent predictor of survival (P =. 09), adjusting for pathologic TNM stage (stage IA vs IB vs stage II–IV, P <. 01).

40|$|IntroductionWith a 5 -year {{survival}} rate of only 16 %, improvements in therapeutic {{strategies for the}} treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are still warranted. Published prognostic gene expression classification signatures in NSCLC overlap poorly across studies. We hypothesized that different NSCLC microarray datasets will share common pathways leading to the identification of new targets for therapeutic development. MethodsPer gene mean expression fold change ratios were calculated from 7 publicly-available microarray datasets consisting of a total of 725 profiled samples. This was followed by mapping of differentially expression genes into functionally annotated biologic pathways using Ingenuity pathway analysis software. Common pathways containing genes whose expression levels differed between phenotypic classes defined by NSCLC cases and/or <b>histology,</b> <b>pathologic</b> stage, and gender were determined. ResultsSeveral significant common pathways overlapping these datasets were identified in silico. One of which, Leukocyte Extravasation Signaling pathway, includes targeted agents such as imatinib, dasatinib, and temozolomide currently under exploration in NSCLC trials. The remaining pathways have targets with few drugs developed or under development in cancer therapeutics. Comparison of pathways derived from Eastern versus Western population datasets revealed several differing targets and potential target drugs. ConclusionThis in silico pathway exploration in NSCLC warrants further investigation and could open the door to potential new therapeutics that might improve NSCLC patient outcomes. This strategy can be applied to other cancer types...|$|R

MethodsNonrandomized prospective study of patients treated by multimodality therapy and operated on between January 2004 and June 2011. Second-line treatments were administered when appropriate. Survival and prognostic factors were analyzed by the Kaplan Meier method, log rank test, and Cox regression analysis. ResultsTwenty-five consecutive patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 22 underwent EPP, and 17 received adjuvant radiotherapy. Over the same period, 54 consecutive patients underwent P/D and hyperthermic pleural lavage and received prophylactic radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. The 30 -day mortality rate was 4. 5 %in the EPP group and nil in the P/D group. Fifteen patients (68 %) in the EPP group and 15 (27. 7 %) in the P/D group experienced complications. There were no differences between the EPP and P/D groups for age, sex, <b>histology,</b> <b>pathologic</b> stage, and nodal status. Trimodality therapy was completed by 68 %of the patients in the EPP group and 100 %in the P/D group.

40|$|Introduction: Neoadjuvant therapy (NT) can {{facilitate}} breast conservation (BC). Similar oncologic outcomes {{have been reported}} with BC and mastectomy for T 1 and T 2 lesions, but studies of BC results for tumors ≥ 5 [*]cm are limited. Our experience with BC for tumors ≥ 5 [*]cm is reported. Patients and methods: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of all breast cancer patients treated with NT at our institution between 2003 and 2010 was performed to identify patients treated with BC for tumors ≥ 5 [*]cm. Demographics, stage, tumor <b>histology,</b> <b>pathologic</b> response, tumor margins, failure patterns and rates, as well as survival rates were recorded. Results: Thirty patients treated with BC after NT for large tumors were identified. The only selection criteria for BC were technical ability with acceptable cosmetic results and negative margins. Patients with genetic predisposition for additional breast cancer were excluded. The mean follow-up was 43 months and the mean age at diagnosis was 51. The mean tumor size at diagnosis was 6. 4 [*]cm and the mean pathological size was 2. 1 [*]cm. Four of thirty (13. 3 %) had either systemic progression or regional recurrence. Three patients had systemic progression, 2 had regional recurrence and none had local recurrence.

40|$|BackgroundIn 1986, Japanese Association for Thoracic Surgery {{started a}} {{nationwide}} {{survey of the}} number of primary lung cancer undergoing resection and this survey was continued annually. Thereafter, investigations of lung cancer surgical results have been conducted three times. The postoperative overall 5 -year survival rate was 47. 8 % in resected cases in 1989, 52. 3 % in 1994, and 62. 0 % in 1999, showing improvement over the decade (p < 0. 01). ObjectiveTo clarify the factors influencing survival improvements retrospectively. Patients and MethodsThe subjects of the investigation are the patients who underwent resection for primary lung cancers in 1989, 1994, and 1999. Postoperatively, after 5 years, surveys of surgical results were sent to institutes where lung cancer resection had been performed. The subjects undergoing resection who provided 10 items (age, sex, pathologic T factor, pathologic N factor, pathologic M factor, date of resection, histology, curability, prognosis, and survival time) numbered 3004 in 1989, 6895 in 1994, and 12, 235 in 1999. They were classified according to the Union International Contre le Cancer 1997 revised tumor, node, and metastasis classification. Differences in age, gender, <b>histology,</b> <b>pathologic</b> stage, curability, and operative death rates were analyzed for each survey year. ResultsAccording to the changes in proportions, the cases over 70 years of age, women, and pathologic stage I increased significantly (p < 0. 001), whereas in cases with small cell lung cancer, incomplete resection and operative death decreased significantly over time (p < 0. 001). ConclusionThe postoperative 5 -year survival rate in Japan improved between 1989 and 1999. The main cause of this improvement was the increase in early stage lung cancer, especially cases with tumors 2 cm or less in size...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The {{extent of}} primary thyroidectomy for {{differentiated}} thyroid cancer is controversial. There are strong proponents for total thyroidectomy {{based on its}} presumed and theoretical disease control benefits. In contrast, there are equally strong advocates of less aggressive thyroidectomy with its lower hazard of parathyroid and recurrent nerve injury. The authors have addressed whether total thyroidectomy has a survival benefit justifying its use in patients with high-risk primary cancer. The major risk factors include age and the following the <b>pathologic</b> determinants follicular <b>histology,</b> vascular invasion, and extracapsular extension. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical pathologic, therapeutic, prognostic, and outcome data were reviewed in 347 patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer. Seventy-five percent were women, 216 patients were in the younger age group (low-risk) (21 - 50 years), 103 were in the intermediate-risk group (51 - 70 years), and 28 were in the high-risk group (> 70 years). Included in the high-risk pathologic category were 158 patients who had follicular histology (55), extracapsular extension (107), or vascular invasion (119). Total thyroidectomy was performed in 56 patients, near or subtotal thyroidectomy in 47 patients and lobectomy in 55 patients. The 10 -year disease specific survival in the overall patient group was 82 % in patients with total thyroidectomy, 78 % in patients with subtotal thyroidectomy, and 89 % in patients with lobectomy (p = 0. 30). There was no significant survival difference according to extent of thyroidectomy in the intermediate or high-risk groups either by age or in patients who had high-risk pathologic feature. CONCLUSIONS: Total thyroidectomy in high-risk patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (containing follicular histology, vascular invasion, or extracapsular extension) showed no benefit over partial thyroidectomy. This suggests that the general use of total thyroidectomy is not indicated, except in highly selected patients...|$|R

Methods: One hundred and forty-eight paraffin-embedded BC tissues from patients of mean age 59. 27 (33 – 96) years and corresponding synchronous lymph node metastases were collected and retrospectively studied using immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization to evaluate HER 2 status. Fleiss-Cohen weighted k statistics were used to assess the concordance rate between HER 2 status of the primary BC and the synchronous metastatic lesions. Results: The overall concordance rate for HER 2 was 95. 28 %. Eighty-nine cases were concordantly HER 2 -negative in primary BC and nodal metastases, and 52 cases were HER 2 -positive in both primary and metastatic tumors. Changes in HER 2 status between primary BC and corresponding synchronous metastases were observed in seven (4. 72 %) cases. Three of the discordant cases were HER 2 -negative in the primary tumor and HER 2 -positive in the metastases, while four cases were HER 2 -positive in the primary BC and HER 2 -negative in the metastases. No significant correlations were identified between HER 2 status and expression of hormone receptors, growth fraction (Ki- 67), or other histopathological parameters (pT, pN, grade). Conclusion: Simultaneous determination of HER 2 in BC and corresponding metastatic lymph nodes is not mandatory, but may strongly influence the therapeutic management. It was demonstrated that loss of HER 2 amplification results in worse post-relapse survival and overall survival in BC patients and, on the other hand, a gain in HER 2 expression in metastatic lymph nodes of BC may allow the possibility of a targeted treatment. Thus, our opinion is that significant prognostic information may be obtained by simultaneous assessment of HER 2 status in both primary and synchronous metastatic BC.
