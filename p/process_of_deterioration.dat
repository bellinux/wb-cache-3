60|$|When I {{first began}} to experimentise on heterostyled plants it was under the {{impression}} that they were tending to become dioecious; but I was soon forced to relinquish this notion, as the long-styled plants of Primula which, from possessing a longer pistil, larger stigma, shorter stamens with smaller pollen- grains, seemed to be the more feminine of the two forms, yielded fewer seeds than the short-styled plants which appeared to be in the above respects the more masculine of the two. Moreover, trimorphic plants evidently come under the same category with dimorphic, and the former cannot be looked at as tending to become dioecious. With Lythrum salicaria, however, we have the curious and unique case of the mid-styled form being more feminine or less masculine in nature than the other two forms. This is shown by the large number of seeds which it yields in whatever manner it may be fertilised, and by its pollen (the grains of which are of smaller size than those from the corresponding stamens in the other two forms) when applied to the stigma of any form producing fewer seeds than the normal number. If we suppose the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>deterioration</b> of the male organs in the mid-styled form to continue, the final result would be the production of a female plant; and Lythrum salicaria would then consist of two heterostyled hermaphrodites and a female. No such case is known to exist, but it is a possible one, as hermaphrodite and female forms of the same species are by no means rare. Although there is no reason to believe that heterostyled plants are regularly becoming dioecious, yet they offer singular facilities, as will hereafter be shown, for such conversion; and this appears occasionally to have been effected.|$|E

Corrosion of metals is an electrochemical <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>deterioration</b> that results from a loss of electrons as they react with water and/or oxygen.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{structural}} engineering, {{a distinction}} {{can be made}} between a structure’s resistance and its stress. A failure may then {{be defined as the}} event in which—due to deterioration—the resistance drops below the stress. This paper proposes a method to combine the two stochastic <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> deteriorating resistance and fluctuating load for computing the time-dependent reliability of a structural system. As deterioration is often uncertain and non-negative, it can best be regarded as a gamma process. A gamma process is a stochastic process with independent non-negative increments having a gamma distribution with identical scale parameter. The stress is assumed to be a stochastic <b>process</b> <b>of</b> random loads exceeding a certain threshold and occurring according to a Poisson <b>process.</b> The variability <b>of</b> the random loads is modelled by a peaks-over-threshold distribution (such as the generalised Pareto distribution). These stochastic <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deterioration</b> and load can be combined in a straightforward manner to perform a time-dependent reliability analysis. ...|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{control in}} {{galleries}} and museums {{is a necessity}} and is informed by the knowledge <b>of</b> ongoing <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>deterioration</b> which can threaten the integrity and stability of artworks. Invisible dimensional changes in many works of art occur following environmental fluctuations as materials respond to the changes in humidity and temperature. The constant influence of dimensional changes usually remains invisible until displacement generates visible deterioration and irreversible damage. This paper exploits fully non contact coherent interferometry in a sequential masking procedure for visualising and studying surface deformation which is the direct effect of dimensional alterations induced by humidity changes. Surface deformation during dimensional displacements of constituent materials may occur on any artwork within an unstable environment. In this context, the presented research study explores the diagnostic potential of fully non contact sensors for the direct structural assessment of environmental effects as they occur in real time on works of art. The method is employed to characterise material responses, complementing and improving understanding of material behaviour in unstable environments...|$|R
