40|$|To {{identify}} significant prognostic {{indicators of}} upper urinary tract (UUT) urothelial carcinoma (UC) {{and to assess}} a risk stratification of patients. We retrospectively analysed data from 162 patients with non-metastatic UC primarily occurring in UUT treated with open nephroureterectomy. Variables assessed included age, gender, pT, tumour grade, <b>tumour</b> necrosis extension, <b>pN,</b> <b>tumour</b> location, multifocal location, tumour diameter, and subsequent development of a bladder tumour. Tumour necrosis was measured using commercial software (Eureka interface system, version 4. 0. 22, HESP technology, Menarini Diagnostics, Italy) and was classified as none, focal (= 10 % of tumour area). The prognostic significance of each variable on metastasis-free survival (MFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was tested in univariable analysis with the log-rank test. Variables with significance levels of P = 3 cm. The median survival of patients with advanced-stage tumours, extensive necrosis and a tumour diameter of >= 3 cm were significantly impaired by increasing pT stage(P < 0. 001). Tumour necrosis and tumour diameter are compelling prognostic factors that deserve further study in a prospective setting to determine if their use in combination with more traditional variables, such as pT stage, might better determine prognosis and guide the follow-up and treatment of patients...|$|R

40|$|Reduced {{nutritional}} state {{is associated with}} unfavourable outcomes and a lower {{quality of life in}} patients with malignancies. Patients with active tumour disease frequently have insufficient food intake. The resting energy expenditure in cancer patients can be increased, decreased, or remain unchanged compared to predicted values. Tumours may result in varying degrees of systemic pro-inflammatory processes with secondary effects on all significant metabolic pathways. Therapeutic objectives are to stabilise {{nutritional state}} with oral/enteral nutrition and parenteral nutrition (PN) and thus to prevent or reduce progressive weight loss. The maintenance or improvement of quality of life, and the increase in the effectiveness and a reduction in the side-effects of antitumor therapy are further objectives. Indications for <b>PN</b> in <b>tumour</b> patients are essentially identical to those in patients with benign illnesses, with preference given to oral or enteral nutrition when feasible. A combined nutritional concept is preferred if oral or enteral nutrition are possible but not sufficient. There are generally no accepted standards for ideal energy and nutrient intakes in oncological patients, particularly when exclusive artificial nutrition is administered. The use of PN as a general accompaniment to radiotherapy or chemotherapy is not indicated, but PN is indicated in chronic severe radiogenic enteritis or after allogenic transplantation with pronounced mucositis or GvHrelated gastrointestinal damage for prolonged periods, with particular attention to increased risk of bleeding and infection. No PN is necessary in the terminal phase...|$|R
40|$|Tumour {{samples from}} 150 {{patients}} with {{squamous cell carcinoma}} of the oesophagus were investigated immunohistochemically with the monoclonal antibody MIB- 1, which recognises proliferating cells. Using light microscopy, the number of MIB- 1 -positive tumour cells was counted in the areas with the highest proliferative activity. The MIB- 1 index was determined as the proportion of MIB- 1 -positive and MIB- 1 -negative tumour cells. A considerable variation of the MIB- 1 indices {{was found between the}} different tumours with a minimum of 6 % and a maximum of 95 % (median, 33 %). The MIB- 1 index correlated significantly with the mitotic activity in the tumour tissue (r = 0. 33; P = 0. 0001) and with the proportion of apoptotic tumour cells (r = 0. 25; P = 0. 0017). No significant correlation was found between the MIB- 1 index and various other prognostic parameters including pT classification, <b>pN</b> classification, <b>tumour</b> grade, blood vessel invasion and lymphatic vessel invasion. In the univariate survival analysis no significant difference was found between tumours with low (33 %) 5 -year survival rate: low MIB- 1 index, 19. 2 %; high MIB- 1 index, 22. 2 %). In a Cox proportional hazard regression analysis only the parameters lymphatic vessel invasion (P = 0. 0001), pT classification (P = 0. 0034) and pN classification (P = 0. 0256), but not the MIB- 1 index, could be verified as independent prognostic variables. In conclusion, evaluation of the MIB- 1 index does not provide prognostic information for oesophageal cancer patients...|$|R
40|$|UNLABELLED The optimum {{treatment}} for differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) is still debated. Results obtained using a selective treatment strategy for papillary (PTC) and follicular (FTC) thyroid carcinoma over 25 years in one institution are reported. 149 patients (mean age 46 yrs) had PTC in TNM stages I-IV in 58 %, 26 %, 15 % and 1 % respectively. Total thyroidectomy and remnant 131 I ablation (43 %) {{were carried out}} in TNM high-risk patients (stages III and IV) and in low-risk patients (I and II) at risk for a (curable) recurrence (stages pN 1 and/or pT 4). Hemi- or total thyroidectomy, without radioiodine, was used in 76 % of pT 1 - 3 N 0 tumours (68 %). Central and/or lateral lymphadenectomy was performed in 42 % of patients (electively in the last 4 years). The mean follow-up was 7 years. RESULTS 6 patients died of PTC and 8 / 143 patients treated for cure had a recurrence (6 nodal, 1 contralateral, 1 local). In low-risk patients [...] including 68 % of patients aged > or = 45 yrs [...] the cause specific 25 -year survival rate was 100 %, vs. 62 % (at 15 years) (p or = 45 yrs) patients with PTC in stages I and II have an excellent prognosis (risk 0). With selective (therapeutic) lymphadenectomy the risk of nodal recurrence may be very low in node negative tumours, without use of radioiodine. Meticulous lymphadenectomy is indicated in <b>pN</b> 1 <b>tumours</b> with nodal recurrences despite 131 I (5 / 36 patients). The technique of capsular dissection for extracapsular total uni- or bilateral thyroidectomy provides excellent oncological and surgical results.

40|$|Abstract Background Lymphatic vessel spread is {{considered}} a major route for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma metastasis. Formation of new lymphatic vessels could facilitate the process, raising the malignant potential of these tumours. Recent identification of lymphatic markers allows {{the study of the}} lymphangiogenesis phenomenon. We searched for molecular events involved in the lymphangiogenic process that could have prognostic value in laryngeal/pharyngeal carcinoma patients. Methods 104 paraffin-embedded pharyngeal/laryngeal tumour samples were studied. Immunohistochemical analysis of podoplanin and double immunofluorescence analysis of Ki- 67 and D 2 - 40 were performed. Lymph vessel density (inside the tumour mass, at its periphery or considered as a whole) and the presence of tumour emboli inside lymphatics were recorded. The proliferative state of endothelial lymphatic cells was evaluated. Results Lymphatic vessels were detected inside the tumour mass (75 %) and in the surrounding tissue (80 %); some of them in a proliferative state. Tumour emboli were detected in a high proportion of the cases (45 %). Lymphatic vessel density was higher in the pharyngeal cases (p = 0. 0029), in greater size (p = 0. 039), more advanced stage primary tumours (p = 0. 006) and in carcinomas of patients with affected nodes (p = 0. 019). The presence of tumour emboli and a high global vessel density were indicators of poor prognosis (recorded as death from tumour) in the laryngeal group (p = 0. 015 and p = 0. 027, respectively), but notably not in the pharyngeal one. Interestingly, high global vessel density showed a negative prognostic value among pathologically staged N 0 laryngeal carcinomas (p = 0. 03). Conclusions The lymphangiogenic process correlated with aggressive <b>tumour</b> features (<b>pN</b> category, <b>tumour</b> size, tumour stage), but might play different roles in tumours arising from different anatomic sites. Our results suggest that detection of tumour emboli and assessment of global vessel density using the D 2 - 40 antibody, may be useful in the clinical practice, as predictors of reduced survival among pN 0 laryngeal carcinoma patients. </p...|$|R
40|$|We prospectively {{investigated}} the prognostic significance of free peritoneal tumour cells (FPTC) {{in a series}} of 118 patients with completely resected gastric carcinoma. Immunocytochemistry with the monoclonal antibody Ber-Ep 4 was performed on cytospins from intraoperative peritoneal lavage specimens. Twenty-three patients (20 %) had FPTC which was significantly correlated with pT and <b>pN</b> categories, stage, <b>tumour</b> size, lymphatic invasion, Laurèn and WHO classifications and perigastric adipose tissue metastases. The median survival time for all FPTC positive compared with negative patients was significantly shorter (11 compared with > 72 months), with estimated 5 -year survival rates of 8 % vs. 60 %. None of the patients with FPTC had an early gastric cancer. In advanced tumour subgroups without and with serosal invasion (n = 59 and 35), there were 19 % and 34 % with FPTC. Multivariate survival analysis showed nodal status, FPTC, mesenteric lymphangiosis, and lymph node metastasis to the compartment III to be independent prognostic factors with relative risks of 6. 6, 4. 5, 2. 9 and 2. 2 respectively. Recurrent disease occurred in 91 % of FPTC-positive and in 38 % of FPTC-negative patients. FPTC had a positive predictive value of 91 % and a specificity of 97 % for tumour recurrence. FPTC is a strong negative, independent prognostic indicator for survival in gastric carcinoma. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R
40|$|Adamantinoma of {{the long}} bones and Ewing's sarcoma are two {{malignant}} tumours between which, at first sight, {{there seems to be}} no morphological and clinical relationship. Both tumours, however. are known to express cytokeratins. Adamantinoma is a tumour of true epithelial nature, predominantly expressing cytokeratins 14 and 19. Ewing's sarcoma, believed to be from neuroectodermal origin, like other mesenchymal tumours, can aberrantly express cytokeratin 8 and 18. In the literature there are some reports of tumours showing clinical and/or morphological overlap between adamantinoma and Ewing's sarcoma, suggesting a possible relationship. These studies are mostly based on the epithelioid configuration of these lesions and their cytokeratin expression on immunohistochemistry. This raises the question of whether there is occasionally a morphological similarity between adamantinoma and Ewing's sarcoma, or whether there is a common genetic background. The Ewing's sarcoma/primitive peripheral neuroectodermal <b>tumour</b> (<b>PN</b> ET) family is characterized in 90 - 95 % of cases by a t(11; 22) and in 5 - 10 % of cases by t(21; 22). In the few reports in the literature on cytogenetic investigations on adamantinoma, these translocations were never found using classical karyotyping. This study investigated the putative presence of t(11; 22) and t(21; 22) in 14 cases of adamantinoma by RT-PCR. These translocations ere not found in any of these cases. The results support the view that these tumours are genetically and clinically distinct, but may eventually show overlapping morphological and immunohistochemical features.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the morbidity of partial nephrectomy (<b>PN)</b> according to <b>tumour</b> {{size and the}} type of indication based on a multicentre retrospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven French teaching hospitals participated in this study. Data concerning tumour size, indication for PN (elective or necessity), age, gender, TNM stage, histological type, Fuhrman grade, ASA score and performance status (ECOG) were analysed. Medical and surgical complications, intraoperative blood loss, blood transfusion rate and length of hospital stay were also studied. Statistical analysis of qualitative and quantitative variables was performed with Chi-square test (Fisher's test) and Student t-test. RESULTS: Six hundred and ninety one patients were included. The median tumour diameter was 3 cm (0. 4 - 18). Tumours measuring less or equal to 4 cm and incidental tumours represented 77. 7 and 80. 7 % of cases, respectively. Clear cell carcinomas represented 75. 1 % of malignant tumours. Some 89. 1 % of tumours were T 1, 1. 6 % were N+ and 2. 3 % were M+. In the 486 elective indications: the operating time (p = 0. 03), mean blood loss (p = 0. 04), and urinary fistula rate (p = 0. 01) were significantly higher in tumours greater than 4 cm. These differences were not associated with an increase in the medical (p = 0. 7) or surgical complication rate (p = 0. 2), or the length of hospital stay (p = 0. 4). CONCLUSION: Broader indications for elective PN is associated with an increased morbidity but which remains acceptable. This is an important point for patient information and to guide the choice of surgical strategy, particularly in elderly, frail patients or patients with major comorbidities...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCONTEXT: The gained {{expertise}} in the surgical technique of partial nephrectomy (PN) with excellent oncologic outcome and reduced morbidity has contributed to more frequent use of PN in many centres of reference, and the recent evidence favouring PN over radical nephrectomy (RN) {{in the prevention of}} chronic kidney disease and possibly linking it to a better overall survival (OS) will constitute a strong argument for wider use of PN. OBJECTIVE: To objectively analyse the advantages of PN over RN and to evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of expanding the indications of PN T 1 b renal cortical tumours. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Literature searches on English-language publications were performed using the National Library of Medicine database. The queries included the keywords partial nephrectomy and nephron sparing surgery. Eight hundred four references were scrutinised, and 175 publications were identified and reviewed. Sixty-nine articles were selected for this review. These references formed the basis for this analysis and were selected based on their relevance and the importance of their content. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The use of PN has been steadily increasing, particularly in tertiary care centres. This trend is now strengthened by evidence supporting the role of PN in reducing the risk of chronic kidney disease in patients with renal masses 4 cm, PN obtained equivalent oncologic outcome to that achieved after RN. Although higher morbidity rates were seen after PN, the complication type and severity were not prohibitive. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence supports elective PN as the standard surgical treatment for renal cortical tumours < or = 4 cm. For larger <b>tumours,</b> <b>PN</b> has demonstrated feasibility and oncologic safety in the carefully selected patient population studied...|$|R
40|$|Contrast-enhanced {{spectral}} mammography (CESM) {{is one of}} the new diagnostic modalities {{implemented in}} clinical practice. In the case of these techniques, there are two major issues to be addressed: (1) their diagnostic usefulness, and (2) the relation between parameters assessed using these techniques and well-known diagnostic/prognostic/predictive markers (histological, clinical, and molecular). Therefore, we studied the relationship between the tumour margin assessed on CESM and (1) tumour borders defined on the basis of macroscopic and microscopic examination, (2) pT, (3) <b>pN,</b> and (4) <b>tumour</b> grade in a group of 82 breast cancer patients. Based on CESM, the tumour border was defined as sharp, indistinct or spiculated, whereas in the case of lesions showing weak or medium enhancement on CESM the borders were classified as unspecified. We found a statistically significant relationship between tumour margin on CESM and (1) macroscopic border (a spiculated margin on CESM was found only in carcinomas with an invasive border on histological examination; p = 0. 004), (2) pT (p = 0. 016), and (3) pN (nodal involvement was observed most frequently in carcinomas with a spiculated or indistinct margin on CESM; p = 0. 045). Moreover, in cases with an undefined margin on CESM (cases showing weak or medium enhancement on CESM), both invasive and pushing borders were found on histological examination. The results of our preliminary study suggest {{that it is possible to}} assess macroscopic borders of examined lesions on the basis of CESM imaging. This might be useful in planning the extent of surgical excision. On the other hand, the assessment of the tumour margin on CESM might not be precise in cases showing weak enhancement...|$|R
40|$|Background: PN is a {{secreted}} {{cell adhesion}} protein critical for carcinogenesis. In breast cancer, it is overexpressed compared to normal breast, {{and a few}} reports suggest {{that it has a}} potential role as a prognostic marker. Methods: Tumour samples obtained at the time of mastectomy from 200 women followed for a median time of 18. 7 years (range 0. 5 - 29. 5 years) were investigated through IHC with a polyclonal anti-PN antibody using tissue microarrays. Epithelial and stromal PN expression were scored independently according to the percentage of coloured cells; the 60 th percentile of PN epithelial expression, corresponding to 1 %, and the median value of PN stromal expression, corresponding to 90 %, were used as arbitrary cut-offs. The relationships between epithelial and stromal PN expression and clinicalpathological features, tumour phenotype and the risk of mortality following surgery were analysed. Appropriate statistics, including the Fine and Gray competing risk proportional hazard regression model, were used. Results: The expression of <b>PN</b> in <b>tumour</b> epithelial cells was significantly lower than that which was observed in stromal cells (p < 0. 000). No specific association between epithelial or stromal PN expression and any of the clinicalpathological parameters analysed was found as it was observed in respect to mortality when these variables were analysed individually. However, when both variables were considered {{as a function of the}} other one, the expression of PN in the stromal cells maintained a statistically significant predictive value with respect to both all causes and cancerspecific mortality only in the presence of high epithelial expression levels. No significant differences in either all causes or BCa-specific mortality rates were shown according to epithelial expression for tumours displaying higher stromal PN expression rates. However, the trends were opposite for the higher stromal values and the patients with high epithelial expression levels denoted the group with the worst prognosis, while higher epithelial values in patients with lower stromal expression levels denoted the group with the best prognosis, suggesting that PN epithelial/stromal interactions play a crucial role in breast carcinogenesis, most likely due to functional cross-talk between the two compartments. On the basis of PN expression in both compartments, we defined 4 subgroups of patients with different mortality rates with the group of patients characterized by positive epithelial and low stromal PN expression cells showing the lowest mortality risk as opposed to the groups of patients identified by a high PN expression in both cell compartments or those identified by a low or absent PN expression in both cell compartments showing the worst mortality rates. The differences were highly statistically significant and were also retained after multiparametric analysis. Competing risk analysis demonstrated that PN expression patterns characterizing each of previous groups are specifically associated with cancer-specific mortality. Conclusions: Although they require further validation through larger studies, our findings suggest that the patterns of expression of PN in both compartments can allow for the development of IHC "signatures" that maintain a strong independent predictive value of both all causes and, namely, of cancer-specific mortality...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of sentinel {{lymph node biopsy}} (SLNB) has conveyed several new issues, such as the risk of false negativity, long-term consequences, the prognostic significance of micrometastases and whether ALND can be omitted in sentinel lymph node- (SLN) positive patients. Archived SLN specimens from 50 false negative patients and 107 true negative controls were serially sectioned and stained with immunohistochemistry. The detection rate of previously unknown metastases did not differ between the false and the true negative patients. The risk of false negativity was higher in patients with multifocal or hormone receptor-negative tumours, or if only one SLN was found. In a Swedish multicentre cohort, 2216 SLN-negative patients in whom ALND was omitted were followed up for a median of 65 months. The isolated axillary recurrence rate was only 1. 0 %, and the overall survival was high (93 %). The survival of 3369 breast cancer patients (2383 node-negative (pN 0), 107 isolated <b>tumour</b> cells (<b>pN</b> 0 (i+), 123 micrometastases (pN 1 mi) and 756 macrometastases (pN 1)) was analysed. The 5 -year cause-specific and event-free survival was worse for pN 1 mi and pN 1 patients than for pN 0 patients. There {{was no difference in}} survival between pN 0 (i+) and <b>pN</b> 0 patients. <b>Tumour</b> and SLN characteristics in 869 SLN-positive patients were compared between those with and without non-SLN metastases, and the Tenon score was calculated. The risk of non-SLN metastases was higher in case of SLN macrometastases (compared with micrometastases), a high positive/total SLN ratio and Elston grade 3 tumours, and increased with increasing tumour size. The area under the curve (AUC) for the Tenon score was 0. 65, and the test thus performed inadequately in this population. In conclusion, despite the risk of false negativity, SLNB with omission of ALND in SLN-negative patients appears to be safe even in the long term. The presence of micrometastases is of prognostic importance and should entail adjuvant treatment. The need for ALND in patients with SLN micro- and even macrometastases has been questioned, but the occurrence of non-SLN metastases is hard to predict, and strong evidence for the safe omission of ALND is lacking...|$|R
