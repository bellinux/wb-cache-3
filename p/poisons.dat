5|$|Over the centuries, {{the variety}} of harmful uses of <b>poisons</b> {{continued}} to increase. The means for curing these <b>poisons</b> also advanced in parallel. In the modern world, intentional poisoning is less common than the Middle Ages. Rather, the more common concern is the risk of accidental poisoning from everyday substances and products.|$|E
5|$|Some frogs, such as {{the poison}} dart frogs, are {{especially}} toxic. The native peoples of South America extract poison from these frogs to apply to their weapons for hunting, although few species are toxic enough {{to be used for}} this purpose. At least two non-poisonous frog species in tropical America (Eleutherodactylus gaigei and Lithodytes lineatus) mimic the colouration of dart poison frogs for self-protection. Some frogs obtain <b>poisons</b> from the ants and other arthropods they eat. Others, {{such as the}} Australian corroboree frogs (Pseudophryne corroboree and Pseudophryne pengilleyi), can synthesize the alkaloids themselves. The chemicals involved may be irritants, hallucinogens, convulsants, nerve <b>poisons</b> or vasoconstrictors. Many predators of frogs have become adapted to tolerate high levels of these <b>poisons,</b> but other creatures, including humans who handle the frogs, may be severely affected.|$|E

50|$|The {{differences}} in toxicity in <b>poison</b> ivy, <b>poison</b> oak, and <b>poison</b> sumac {{are due to}} {{differences in}} the side chains of the chemicals in these plants.

50|$|The green-and-black <b>poison</b> dart frog, {{while not}} the most toxic <b>poison</b> dart frog, is still a highly toxic animal. The very small amount of <b>poison</b> the frog {{possesses}} {{is enough to make}} a human heart stop beating. However, like most <b>poison</b> dart frogs, the green-and-black <b>poison</b> dart frog only releases its <b>poison</b> if it feels threatened, and wild specimens can be handled provided the human holding it is calm and relaxed. The green-and-black <b>poison</b> dart frog, as with all <b>poison</b> dart frogs, loses its toxicity in captivity due to a change in diet. This has led some scientists to believe that the green-and-black <b>poison</b> frog actually takes its <b>poison</b> from the mites and other insects on which it feeds.|$|R

5|$|Adolescence and adulthood: When rats forage {{on their}} own, their food choices are {{influenced}} by social interactions that may take place far away from foraging sites.

50|$|Though <b>poison</b> is {{an option}} to prevent voles, <b>poisoned</b> voles can create a threat to other animals and humans. Voles are prey for other predators. If they are eaten by predators while <b>poisoned,</b> the <b>poison</b> could harm the predator. In addition, when placing <b>poison</b> near vole entrances, other animals {{may be able to}} reach it, making it a hazard to them. Moreover, <b>poison</b> left in the field can easily be blown or washed away. In {{residential}} areas, the <b>poison</b> itself and <b>poisoned</b> voles can be harmful and/or dangerous to people and domesticated animals.

5|$|Dudley was {{credited}} with discovering that a toxic component of tobacco smoke is carbon monoxide (which <b>poisons</b> the blood by interfering with oxygen's ability to bind to hemoglobin). Dudley rejected the popularly held opinion that cigarette smoke was harmful due to the adulteration of the tobacco, e. g. with opium. His experiments showed the toxic agent to be carbon monoxide, resulting alike from cigarette, pipe, or cigar.|$|E

40|$|There are hundred {{thousands}} of deaths per annum from <b>poisoning</b> in the World.

In some circumstances, many of these materials can potentially induce <b>poisoning.</b> In excessive amounts, chemicals that are usually harmless, even apparently safe drugs can cause <b>poisoning.</b> To reduce the morbidity and mortality and overall burden of <b>poisoning</b> in the community, consideration {{should be given to}} developing education program as an effective tool and establishing <b>poison</b> information centers...|$|R
