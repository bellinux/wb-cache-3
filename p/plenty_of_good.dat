25|$|From an {{exploration}} point of view, Forrest's third expedition was of great importance. A large area of previously unknown land was explored, {{and the popular}} notion of an inland sea was shown to be unlikely. However, the practical results were not great. <b>Plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> pastoral land was found up {{to the head of}} the Murchison, but beyond that, the land was useless for pastoral enterprise, and Forrest was convinced that it would never be settled. Forrest also made botanical collections during the expedition that were given to Ferdinand von Mueller, who, in turn, named Eremophila forrestii in his honour.|$|E
500|$|Shane Hegarty of The Irish Times {{wrote that}} it [...] "may {{not have been}} a vintage episode [...] but it had <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> moments, and from an Irish {{perspective}} it was a fascinating opportunity to see ourselves {{through the eyes of the}} greatest comedy series ever written." [...] He added that [...] "even as it reveled in stereotypes, it used them to continue the running joke about how Ireland doesn't conform to American's [...] views of it." [...] Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald gave the episode two stars. He wrote that he enjoyed the jokes about the Irish landmarks but called it [...] "a fairly slapdash, ramshackle half-hour" [...] and mentioned that Colm Meaney deserved a better role. Evan Fanning of the Sunday Independent wrote [...] "Yes, The Simpsons came to Ireland and all we got was some lousy rehashed jokes and a feeling that the whole thing was a bit of a waste of time." ...|$|E

Writing for Exclaim!, Greg Pratt {{said that}} Repentless [...] "isn't {{going to be}} one of the classic Slayer albums, but there's still <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> thrash to be found." [...] Journalist J.C. Maçek III of Spectrum Culture wrote [...] "The truth is that it might be easy to dismiss Slayer after almost 35 years as a nostalgic metal act. This would be a travesty and a mistake. Slayer not only has something new to say on Repentless, but a new way to say it." [...] AllMusic writer Thom Jurek gave the album three out of five stars, calling Repentless [...] "a retro, workmanlike effort from a band determined to soldier on, and that's fine. There are hardcore devotees who never want their favorite bands to change; this is for them. But again, given all that's transpired since 2009, Slayer get points for even pulling this off." [...] The Guardian stated that [...] "Slayer have always been a model of consistency and a band that fans of vicious, vein-bursting heavy metal can rely on." [...] Kim Kelly, writing in Spin was less enthusiastic, calling the album [...] "middling" [...] and stating that it [...] "mostly falls flat." ...|$|E

500|$|Canadian music {{magazine}} Exclaim! published two {{reviews of}} Daybreaker. Bradley Zorgdrager gave an unfavourable {{review of the}} album's sound. He said although the tracks are [...] "catchy and occasionally compelling, they're essentially identical and formulaic, as the atmospheric build-ups and soaring riffs make way for boring breakdowns. The metal-influenced parts sound forced to appease fans disappointed with their last release, which results in Daybreaker sounding more like a business move than a work of art." [...] Scott Harms' review was more favourable, praising the band's return to a much more aggressive style. He credits it for incorporating influences from previous albums, saying [...] "they have found a balance in which {{to return to the}} Searle brothers' heavy sounds while carefully incorporating Sam Carter's soaring clean vocals". Harms summarised his review by saying, [...] "as a whole, [...] sounds epic". Adam Rees of Metal Hammer rated the album 7 out of 10, acknowledging the [...] "abundant" [...] inclusion of string instruments and piano and the way these instruments create atmosphere. Ress ended his review by calling Daybreaker, [...] "A brave and brilliant British metal album". Canoe.ca author Darryl Sterdan awarded the album 2.5 stars out of 5, saying it [...] "balanc their newfound sensitivity and maturity with <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> old-fashioned techno-metal frenzy and primal-scream aggro. Pity they didn’t write memorable songs while they were at it." ...|$|E

It found <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> pastoral land around {{the headwaters of the}} Murchison River, but by late May, it was travelling over arid land. On 2 June, while dangerously short of water, it discovered Weld Springs, [...] "one of the best springs in the colony" [...] according to Forrest. At Weld Springs on 13 June, the party was attacked by a large group of Aborigines, and Forrest shot a number of them.|$|E

Their form was key to their team Middlesex winning the County Championship for the first time since 1921, although they were involved in a tight contest for the title with the eventual runners-up Gloucestershire, for whom Tom Goddard was the most outstanding bowler of the season.

The shelves are not level and the dishes are brought to a comparatively horizontal position by means of chips and bits of bark, inserted under the lower side. The milk is covered by soiled sheets of old newspapers supported on sticks laid across the dishes. This protection is necessary, because the box bark in the roof has crumbled away and left fringed holes—also because the fowls roost up there.

Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club graded the episode a B- and while she acknowledged MacFarlane's involvement was missing, she did say that it [...] "felt very much like Family Guy, albeit a not-so-great episode". Robert Pierson from the TV Critic also gave the episode a mixed review; he compared the story to the ones from the episodes of the show's first season which he stated was [...] "a good thing" [...] although he did classify the episode's jokes as [...] "more miss than hit"; he ended his review by calling the episode [...] "a fun story with <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> jokes flowing from it" [...] and he gave it a 58 out of 100.|$|E

[...] Mark Thomas of Mania also gave it an overall score of A, stating: [...] "It has <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> action and thought provoking plot points." [...] Andy Patricio of IGN rated the first DVD volume 9/10 praised the animation, stating: [...] "Artwork is richer; this is easily the best-looking anime Production I.G. has ever produced. CG is richer and more widely-used. Animation is more complex and fluid, although it's still a little jerky, which is common in TV shows." [...] Joe Luscik of Animefringe ranked the series 4.5 out of 5 praising the animation stating it [...] "is just awesome". Adam Arseneau of DVD Verdict praised {{the direction of the}} 2nd season compared to the first stating, [...] "The tongue-in-cheek humor that made the show clever and endearing is still present, but the atmosphere feels more violent, more urban and dystopic, as if no longer afraid to address the social problems of the future." ...|$|E

Rediff.com believed the movie had <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> moments, and plenty of bad ones and believed the film was superior to that of the original on Bhagat Singh, although they believed the agony of Bhagat Singh's fight was underplayed, diminishing the brutality and anguish suffered in the real life event. While Deol was praised for some scenes, he was criticised for shouting and Rediff believed he was overshadowed by Ajay Devgan remarking, [...] "In terms of performance, Devgan is clearly the winner, with the advantage of a stronger script and a better director.

Pournelle disliked the requirement to buy another license to distribute binaries, but noted that [...] "it turns {{out not to be}} a lot more. Borland only wants another $100" [...] more than the $49.95 base price, and that [...] "my first impression of Turbo is that it's probably worth $149.95. It looks to do everything MT+ with the Speed Programming Package does, and maybe even do it faster and better". He reported in July that, according to Kahn, IBM had refused to resell Turbo Pascal unless the price was at least $200; Pournelle noted that [...] "Turbo is much better than the Pascal IBM sells", and unlike the latter was compatible with the IBM PCjr. Three BYTE reviewers praised Turbo Pascal in the same issue. One called the DOS version [...] "without doubt, the best software value I have ever purchased", and another called the CP/M version [...] "an excellent product ... deserves praise for this high-value product". The third stated that it was [...] "not a good compiler for developing massive applications", but added that it was greatly superior to BASIC, the programming language usually associated with home computers at the time. He concluded that Turbo Pascal was [...] "a bargain that shouldn't be passed up".|$|E

In the Eastern Sheep Creek Hills in the Thomas Fork valley the emigrants encountered Big Hill. Big Hill was a detour caused by a then-impassable cut the Bear River made through the mountains and had a tough ascent often requiring doubling up of teams and a very steep and dangerous descent.

At Fort Hall nearly all travelers were given some aid and supplies if they were available and needed.
