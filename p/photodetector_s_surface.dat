In order to enhance the adaptability of <b>S</b> <b>surface</b> controller, the research of <b>S</b> <b>surface</b> controller parameter self-tuning methods based on rules and models is carried out. Firstly, combined with fuzzy control, parameter self-tuning method based on fuzzy rules is presented. Then by means of predictive control theory, model-based parameter self-tuning method is proposed. By introducing the nonlinear autoregressive moving average model, the prediction model of underwater vehicles is established using parallel Elman neural network, and the optimal parameters of <b>S</b> <b>surface</b> controller is obtained by constructing quadratic performance index function.

Tissue engineering of a meniscus implant using meniscal cells offers {{the promise of}} enhancing the reparative process and achieving functional meniscal repair. In this work, using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis, we show that human fibrochondrocytes rapidly dedifferentiate during monolayer expansion on standard tissue culture flasks, representing a significant limit to clinical use of this cell population for meniscal repair. Previously, we have characterized and described the feasibility of a tailored biomimetic <b>surface</b> (C 6 <b>S</b> <b>surface)</b> for reversing dedifferentiation of monolayer-expanded rat meniscal cells. The surface is comprised of major meniscal extracellular matrix (ECM) components in the inner region, namely collagen I/II (at a 2 : 3 ratio) and chondroitin- 6 -sulfate. We thus have further evaluated {{the effects of the}} C 6 <b>S</b> <b>surface,</b> alongside a number of other tailored surfaces, on cell adhesion, proliferation, matrix synthesis and relevant marker gene expression (collagen I, –II, aggrecan and Sox- 9 etc) of passaged human fibrochondrocytes in 2 D (coated glass coverslips) and 3 D (surface-modified polymeric scaffolds) environments.
