5|$|Emergency {{ambulance}} – The {{most common}} type of ambulance, which <b>provide</b> <b>care</b> to patients with an acute illness or injury. These can be road-going vans, boats, helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft (known as air ambulances) or even converted vehicles such as golf carts.|$|E
5|$|Ship – Ships {{can be used}} as {{hospital}} ships, mostly {{operated by}} national military services, although some ships are operated by charities. They can meet the definition of ambulances as they provide transport to the sick and wounded (along with treatment). They are often sent to disaster or war zones to <b>provide</b> <b>care</b> for the casualties of these events.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{a hospice}} {{will be unable}} to <b>provide</b> <b>care</b> to a patient, either due to {{philosophical}} differences with the patient or due to a safety issue. Such causes could include disruptive or abusive behavior from the patient or other persons in the patient's home or refusal to cooperate with the hospice program. Patients may, after being discharged from hospice for any reason, re-enroll in hospice at a later date as necessary.|$|E
50|$|All childminders in England {{are legally}} {{required}} {{to register with}} OFSTED on the Early Years register (if <b>providing</b> <b>care</b> for {{children under the age}} of five), and the Compulsory part of the General Childcare Register (if <b>providing</b> <b>care</b> for children aged between five and eight years old). Childminders do not have to be registered if they are only <b>providing</b> <b>care</b> for children over the age of eight.|$|R

In early 2006, HERU's first EMT class graduated and the organization transitioned to <b>providing</b> <b>care</b> at the EMT level at all time.|$|R
5|$|Should {{a patient}} be {{transferred}} to an assisted living facility, nursing home, or hospital, the hospice would continue to <b>provide</b> <b>care</b> to the patient which is on par with the services provided under the routine home care benefit. In this way, {{the only difference between}} respite and routine care is that the hospice pays the room and board charges of the facility. Should a patient receive respite in an inpatient hospice unit the care would be similar to what other patients of the hospice unit receive. Respite is provided for a maximum of five days every benefit period.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{she assumed}} the {{management}} of the 300-bed Asnée Military Hospital for spinal cord and head injuries in Nancy. Unable to leave France because of World War II, she initiated programs to <b>provide</b> <b>care</b> packages for troops and POWs in North Africa. In August 1940, de Bourgoing agreed to serve as Vice-President of the newly formed Unified French Red Cross. In 1944, despite the cold winter, she travelled to the front lines in the Vosges to encourage the 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division who were engaged in heavy battles with the Germans. When the war ended, she resumed her trips to Morocco, spending several months there each year. In 1946, de Bourgoing was not only appointed Directrice Générale de la Croix Rouge but was elevated to Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour, the first woman to receive the honour. She was also awarded the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Ouissam Alaouite in recognition of her work in Morocco.|$|E

5|$|During the English Civil War, the Royal Fort was {{considered}} the strongest part of Bristol's defences, and {{it was to the}} fort that the Royalists retreated when they found themselves under siege from the Parliamentarians. It fell to the parliamentary forces in 1645 and was subsequently demolished. St Nicholas's Almshouses were built in 1652 to <b>provide</b> <b>care</b> for the poor. Several public houses were also built in this period, including the Llandoger Trow on King Street and the Hatchet Inn. More churches were built, including St Michael on the Mount Without. It served the St Michaels hill area, one of the first areas outside the city walls to be colonised by the wealthy merchants who were by then trying to escape the overcrowded and unhealthy conditions in the city centre. The city was by this time beginning to expand rapidly beyond its traditional city walls, and the surrounding villages were starting to become suburbs, such as the villages of Horfield and Brislington. Both had their own churches, the Church of the Holy Trinity with St Edmund and St Lukes respectively.|$|E
5|$|In October 1918, with victory near, Downes {{was confronted}} by his most serious medical crisis. Damascus {{contained}} over 3,000 sick and wounded Turkish soldiers, {{many of them in}} appalling condition. Downes appointed the DADMS of the Australian Mounted Division, Major W. Evans, as Principal Medical Officer of Damascus, and gave him orders to organise the medical arrangements, bury the dead and <b>provide</b> <b>care</b> for the living. The task was made more difficult by the poor communications and transport shortages, which hampered the delivery of supplies and evacuation of the hospitals; by shortages of medical units; and by the actions of Lieutenant Colonel T. E. Lawrence, who was more concerned with establishing the political authority of Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca over Damascus. At this point the Desert Mounted Corps itself began to experience epidemic diseases, particularly of bronchopneumonia, cholera and malaria, putting the medical services under enormous pressure. Through extraordinary measures, including the diversion of lighthorsemen and motor vehicles to medical units, Downes managed to evacuate the sick to Beirut, and the crisis abated.|$|E
5|$|With Merrick {{admitted}} into the hospital, Treves now {{had time to}} conduct a more thorough examination. He discovered that Merrick's physical condition had deteriorated over {{the previous two years}} and that he had become quite crippled by his deformities. Treves also suspected that Merrick now suffered from a heart condition and that he had only a few years left to live. Merrick's general health improved over the next five months under the care of the hospital staff. Although some nurses were initially upset by his appearance, they overcame this and cared for him. The problem of his unpleasant odour was mitigated through frequent bathing and Treves gradually developed an understanding of Merrick's speech. A new set of photographs was taken. The question of Merrick's long-term care had to be addressed. Francis Carr Gomm, the chairman of the hospital committee, had supported Treves in his decision to admit Merrick, but by November, long-term plans needed to be made. The London Hospital was not equipped or staffed to <b>provide</b> <b>care</b> for the incurable, which Merrick clearly was.|$|E
