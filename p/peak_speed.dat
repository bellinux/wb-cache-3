5|$|If the {{controller}} were to background garbage collect {{all of the}} spare blocks before it was absolutely necessary, new data written from the host could be written without having to move any data in advance, letting the performance operate at its <b>peak</b> <b>speed.</b> The trade-off {{is that some of}} those blocks of data are actually not needed by the host and will eventually be deleted, but the OS did not tell {{the controller}} this information. The result is that the soon-to-be-deleted data is rewritten to another location in the flash memory, increasing the write amplification. In some of the SSDs from OCZ the background garbage collection clears up {{only a small number of}} blocks then stops, thereby limiting the amount of excessive writes. Another solution is to have an efficient garbage collection system which can perform the necessary moves in parallel with the host writes. This solution is more effective in high write environments where the SSD is rarely idle. The SandForce SSD controllers and the systems from Violin Memory have this capability.|$|E
5|$|During {{the lunch}} interval, heavy rain fell, {{before the sun}} began to dry the pitch, making the ball skid through upon England's {{resumption}} at 13/1. Miller beat Washbrook's bat twice in one over soon after the resumption, {{but was unable to}} extract an edge. Lindwall reached his <b>peak</b> <b>speed</b> and Edrich edged to first slip, where Ian Johnson got both hands to the ball above his head, but failed to hold on. Edrich was on four at the time and this was part of a 20-minute passage of play during which England was unable to score. The next ball from Lindwall, Washbrook was caught on the run by Brown on the fine leg boundary after attempting to hook a bouncer pitched on the line of leg stump. It was to be the first of several times that Washbrook was dismissed while hooking, attracting substantial criticism. Washbrook's fall left England at 15/2 after 41 minutes of batting and brought Compton to the crease to join Edrich. Compton square drove Miller to the boundary for four, which prompted a retaliatory bouncer and a negative crowd reaction. Edrich was not scoring quickly but he defied the bowling of Miller and Lindwall as the English pair took the score to 46. Likewise, Compton was restraining his natural inclination to attack in an attempt to rebuild the innings after the two early wickets. During this period Brown made a series of one-handed run-saving stops in the field. The rain had also softened up the pitch and as a result, the playing surface did not offer much bounce.|$|E

25|$|The <b>peak</b> <b>speed</b> of the {{butterfly}} is faster {{than that of}} the front crawl, or freestyle due to the synchronous pull/push with both arms and legs.

Another reason it is slower is because of the extremely different physical exertion it puts on the swimmer compared to the freestyle.|$|E
25|$|The {{interpretation}} by Frey & Riess {{became the}} dominant one, but was challenged in 2004 by Sanders, who showed experimentally that, whereas an alternate movement {{might have caused}} excessive pitching, a simultaneous movement would have caused only a slight pitch, {{which could have been}} easily controlled by the hind flippers. Of the other axial movements, rolling could have been controlled by alternately engaging the flippers of the right or left side, and yaw by the long neck or a vertical tail fin. Sanders did not believe that the hind pair was not used for propulsion, concluding that the limitations imposed by the hip joint were very relative. In 2010, Sanders & Carpenter concluded that, with an alternating gait, the turbulence caused by the front pair would have hindered an effective action of the hind pair. Besides, a long gliding phase after a simultaneous engagement would have been very energy efficient. It is also possible that the gait was optional and was adapted to the circumstances. During a fast steady pursuit, an alternate movement would have been useful; in an ambush, a simultaneous stroke would have made a <b>peak</b> <b>speed</b> possible. When searching for prey over a longer distance, a combination of a simultaneous movement with gliding would have cost the least energy. In 2017, a study by Luke Muscutt, using a robot model, concluded that the rear flippers were actively employed, allowing for a 60% increase of the propulsive force and a 40% increase of efficiency. The stroke would have been at its most powerful using a slightly alternating gait, the rear flippers engaging just after the front flippers, to benefit from their wake. However, there would not have been a single optimal phase for all conditions, the gait likely having been changed as the situation demanded.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, Jan Boklöv pioneered the V-style: skis were instead spread {{outwards}} in an aerodynamic [...] "V" [...] shape, with the athlete's body lying much flatter between them.

40|$|Purpose. Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the age of <b>peak</b> freestyle swimming <b>speed</b> is reached earlier in life in women than in men. However, no study has investigated the age of <b>peak</b> swimming <b>speed</b> in other swimming styles such as butterfly. The aims of the present study were to investigate the age of <b>peak</b> swimming <b>speed</b> in elite male and female butterfly and freestyle swimmers at the national level (Switzerland) and the sex differences in both the age of <b>peak</b> swimming <b>speed</b> and swimming speed for both swimming styles. Methods. Results of the elite Swiss swimmers between 2006 and 2010 were analysed using one-way analysis of variance. Results. In butterfly, women achieved <b>peak</b> swimming <b>speed</b> at 20 - 21 years in the 50 m, 100 m and 200 m, whereas men reached their fastest swimming speed in the 50 m at 20 - 21 years and in both the 100 m and 200 m at 18 - 19 years. In freestyle, women achieved <b>peak</b> swimming <b>speed</b> at 20 - 21 years for all distances. Men were the fastest at 22 - 23 years for both the 100 m and 200 m and at 26 - 27 years for the 50 m. In the butterfly, the sex difference in swimming speed was highest in the 50 m and lowest in the 200 m (14. 1 % ± 0. 2 in the 50 m, 12. 6 % ± 1. 0 in the 100 m and 8. 7 % ± 1. 8 in the 200 m). Additionally, the sex difference in freestyle swimming speed was highest in the 50 m and lowest in the 200 m (16. 2 % ± 0. 5 in the 50 m, 15. 9 % ± 0. 4 in 100 m and 14. 9 % ± 1. 0 in 200 m). Conclusions. These findings suggest that <b>peak</b> swimming <b>speed</b> was achieved earlier in life in men compared with women for the 100 m and 200 m butterfly distances but not in the 50 m butterfly. In freestyle, <b>peak</b> swimming <b>speed</b> was achieved at younger ages in women compared with men.
