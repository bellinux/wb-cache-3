40|$|The {{health risk}} of organic micro {{pollutants}} in water {{is yet to}} be comprehensively established. However, the persistence of these pollutants in the environment as a result of continuous discharge even at trace concentrations is considered to pose major environmental concerns. Advance treatment methods such as membrane-assisted processes (MAPs) are potential technologies capable of removing a wide range of these organic micropollutants (OMPs) detected in water. Tight membranes as regards pore size are reported to be more efficient than loose membranes mainly because of the removal mechanism involved, which is mainly influenced by the properties of the membrane and the pollutants in relation to solute–solute and solute–membrane interaction.
