25|$|Regardless of {{specific}} chronology, many European Neolithic groups share basic characteristics, such as living in small-scale, family-based communities, subsisting on domesticated {{plants and animals}} supplemented with the collection of wild plant foods and with hunting, and producing hand-made pottery, that is, pottery made without the potter's wheel. Polished stone axes {{lie at the heart}} of the neolithic (new stone) culture, enabling forest clearance for agriculture and <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> for dwellings, as well as fuel.|$|E
25|$|If a tree grows all {{its life}} in the open and the {{conditions}} of soil and site remain unchanged, it will make its most rapid growth in youth, and gradually decline. The annual rings of growth are for many years quite wide, but later they become narrower and narrower. Since each succeeding ring is laid down {{on the outside of}} the wood previously formed, it follows that unless a tree materially increases its <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> from year to year, the rings must necessarily become thinner as the trunk gets wider. As a tree reaches maturity its crown becomes more open and the annual wood production is lessened, thereby reducing still more the width of the growth rings. In the case of forest-grown trees so much depends upon the competition of the trees in their struggle for light and nourishment that periods of rapid and slow growth may alternate. Some trees, such as southern oaks, maintain the same width of ring for hundreds of years. Upon the whole, however, as a tree gets larger in diameter the width of the growth rings decreases.|$|E
500|$|Wood gives {{structural}} strength {{to the trunk}} of a tree; this supports the plant as it grows larger [...] The vascular system of trees allows water, nutrients and other chemicals to be distributed around the plant, and without it trees {{would not be able to}} grow as large as they do. Trees, as relatively tall plants, need to draw water up the stem through the xylem from the roots by the suction produced as water evaporates from the leaves. If insufficient water is available the leaves will die. The three main parts of trees include the root, stem, and leaves; they are integral parts of the vascular system which interconnects all the living cells. In trees and other plants that develop wood, the vascular cambium allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth. Because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also have a cork cambium that develops among the phloem. The cork cambium gives rise to thickened cork cells to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss. Both the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> and the production of cork are forms of secondary growth.|$|E
