40|$|This study {{examines}} the discursive structures and linguistic features of research articles (RAs) written in Indonesian by Indonesian writers {{with the aim}} of exploring how Indonesian writers rhetorically describe their research methods in their RAs. The corpus for this study consists of 51 selected RAs published mainly in university-based social science and humanity journals in Indonesia. The seven-move structure (SMS) model for RA <b>method</b> <b>sections</b> was employed. The results showed that, first, the SMS model can capture broad communicative units or moves in the Indonesian RA <b>method</b> <b>section</b> but not smaller communicative units or steps. Second, in terms of the occurrence of moves and steps, the Indonesian RA <b>method</b> <b>section</b> is generally similar to the ones in English. Third, the use of discourse and linguistic markers is quite frequent in the Indonesian RA <b>method</b> <b>sections.</b> It is believed that Indonesian writers will not find it rhetorically difficult to write the <b>method</b> <b>section</b> of RAs in English as far as they are well informed of common linguistic features of English academic texts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract To {{find out}} whether {{replication}} of <b>methods</b> <b>section</b> in biosciences papers {{is a kind of}} plagiarism, the authors firstly surveyed the behavior of authors when writing the <b>methods</b> <b>section</b> in their published papers. Then the descriptions of one well-established method in randomly selected papers published in eight top journals were analyzed using CrossCheck to identify the extent of duplication. Finally, suggestions on preparing the <b>methods</b> <b>sections</b> were given. The survey results show that an author may employ different approaches to writing the <b>methods</b> <b>section</b> within a paper, repeating published methods is more often than give citation only or rewrite complete using one’s own words. Authors are more likely to repeat the description of a method than simply to provide a citation. From the samples of the eight leading journals, plagiarize is very rare in such journals; Learning from Science, attachment may be a considerable choice for papers with common methods...|$|R

The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the differences between fast and slow tendencies in <b>Methods</b> <b>sections</b> in terms of their internal, cognitive discourse organization. Two small corpora, each consisting of thirty <b>Methods</b> <b>sections</b> (one for each of the two groups of subjects), are analyzed in two ways. First the corpora are rater-analyzed for their use of the organizational features of a cognitive genre model for textual structures (see Bruce, I. J. (2005). Syllabus design for general EAP courses: a cognitive approach. Journal of English for Academic Purposes, 4 (3), 239 – 256.) and secondly by the use of corpus software for linguistic features that characterize the model. The findings of the study suggest that ‘fast’ <b>Methods</b> <b>sections</b> that report research in the physical sciences generally employ a means-focused discourse structure, and ‘slow’ <b>Methods</b> <b>sections</b> in social science reports tend to employ a combination of chronological and non-sequential descriptive structures. The study concludes that learner writers may benefit from access to the types of general, procedural knowledge that these discoursal structures employ...|$|R

Authors {{are entitled to a}} justified decision on the publication or not of their work. Thus, reviewers need to assure the authors that they have studied, correctly interpreted and fairly judged their work. This can be done by writing a short introductory paragraph in their critique, mentioning the type of study, the subjects recruited, the time and places the study was conducted, the interventions, the outcome measures and the statistical tests. All these information should be found in the <b>methods</b> <b>section.</b> If the reviewer cannot find these information, he needs not to read the whole article.
