5|$|Before Hurricane Georges, FEMA issued {{disaster}} declarations for Ascension, Assumption, Jefferson, Lafourche, Livingston, Plaquemines, Orleans, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. James, St. John the Baptist, St. Tammany, Terrebone, Tangipahoa, and Washington Parishes. The declaration allowed {{residents to}} receive individual and public assistance. Including relief funds to Puerto Rico and Mississippi associated with Georges, {{a total of}} $14,150,532 insurance claims was paid for by FEMA. The Clinton administration appropriated $56million in <b>post-disaster</b> funds for regions impacted Tropical Storm Frances and Hurricane Georges in Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of all four cyclones, the Cook Islands {{requested}} international assistance. Funding to repair damages from the storms reached $7.87million. The Red Cross provided relief items, such as blankets and lanterns worth $35,200; the Pacific Forum provided food, fuel, and logistical support worth $32,000; the Government of China donated $19,200 in <b>post-disaster</b> funds; $32,000 in funding {{was provided by the}} United Nations Development Programme; contributions from the Australian Agency for International Development and the New Zealand Agency for International Development amounted to $862,570, consisting of fuel, shelter, relief items, and disaster funds; the Government of Australia provided $128,000 wort of fuel and equipment; lastly, the Government of France deployed military teams with recovery supplies and tents. The European Union also supplied £200,000 ($280,000) in relief funds.|$|E
5|$|The sheer {{magnitude}} of the flood event in the Anilao–Malbasag watershed made the region more vulnerable to future flood events. Hillsides became more unstable and the rivers themselves were clogged with debris, raising their water levels and widening their banks. In a <b>post-disaster</b> assessment in October 1992, it was stated that swift cooperation of all agencies from local to governmental was necessary to prevent tragedies of similar caliber in the future. It was urged that residents still living along the river banks be relocated to safer areas; however, {{by the time of}} the report, people had already begun repopulating the area. As a way of avoiding similar breaching of the riverbank, it was suggested that the two rivers be dredged and possibly re-channeled. Several points were also brought up about rehabilitating the landscape of the watershed: reforestation, contoured farming, and redesigning of plantations to better retain rainwater. Long-term rehabilitation of the watershed was deemed necessary in addition to repairing infrastructure in Ormoc.|$|E

25|$|<b>Post-disaster</b> {{analysis}} revealed that two previous shuttle launches (STS-52 and -62) also had bipod ramp foam loss that went undetected. In addition, Protuberance Air Load (PAL) ramp foam had also shed pieces, and there were also spot losses from large-area foams.|$|E
25|$|In <b>post-disaster</b> reactions, formal benefit {{societies}} {{of our time}} often lend aid to others outside their immediate membership, while ad hoc benefit associations form among neighbors or refugees, generally lasting {{only as long as}} the emergency exists. Ad hoc mutual aid associations have been seen organized among strangers facing shared challenges in such disparate settings as the Woodstock Music and Arts Festival in New York in 1969, during the Beijing Tiananmen square protests of 1989, for neighborhood defense during the Los Angeles Riots of 1992, and work of the organization Common Ground Collective which formed in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The Rainbow Family organizes gatherings in National Forests of the United States each year around age old models of ad hoc mutual aid.|$|E
25|$|The World Trade Center Health Registry was {{established}} in 2002 by ATSDR and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to track the long-term {{physical and mental health}} effects of the September 11 attacks. The registry contains more than 71,000 people who lived, worked, or went to school near the World Trade Center site, as well as emergency response personnel who were involved in rescue and recovery efforts. It is the largest <b>post-disaster</b> health registry in the United States. Researchers use the registry to study the health effects of the disaster and to develop public health recommendations for future disasters. A 2009 study based on registry data found that posttraumatic stress disorder and asthma were the two most commonly reported conditions among registry participants 5 to 6 years after the disaster. The study found that 19% of adult participants reported new posttraumatic stress symptoms, and 10% of adult participants reported developing new asthma.|$|E
25|$|At {{the request}} of the Security Council, the Secretary-General issued a report on women's {{participation}} in peacebuilding in 2010. The report outlines the challenges women continue to face in participating in recovery and peacebuilding process and the negative impact this exclustion has on them and societies more broadly. To respond to these challenges, it advocates a comprehensive 7-point action plan covering the seven commitment areas: mediation; post-conflict planning; financing; civilian capacity; post-conflict governance; rule of law; and economic recovery. The action plan aims to facilitate progress on the women, peace and security agenda. The monitoring and implementation of this action plan is now being led jointly by the Peacebuilding Support Office and UN Women. In April 2011, the two organizations convened a workshop to ensure that women are included in future <b>post-disaster</b> and post-conflict planning documents. In the same year, the PBF selected seven gender-sensitive peacebuilding projects to receive $5 million in funding.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of deadly and destructive tornadoes, President Bill Clinton signed a major disaster declaration for eleven Oklahoma counties on May 4. In a press statement by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), then-director James Lee Witt stated that [...] "The President is deeply concerned about the tragic loss of life and destruction caused by these devastating storms." [...] The American Red Cross opened ten shelters overnight across central Oklahoma, housing 1,600 people immediately following the disaster. By May 5, this number had lowered to 500. Throughout May 5, several <b>post-disaster</b> teams from FEMA were deployed to the region, including emergency response and preliminary damage assessment units. The United States Department of Defense deployed the 249th Engineering Battalion and placed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on standby for assistance. Medical and mortuary teams were also sent by the Department of Health and Human Services. By May 6, donation centers and phone banks were being established to create funds for victims of the tornadoes.|$|E
500|$|In Tokushima, {{two people}} were listed as missing and two others {{sustained}} serious injuries. Later news reports stated that up to 18 people were missing following further landslides. The affected region was especially susceptible to landslides due to recent seismic activity, with a magnitude 6.4 earthquake taking place on August10. By August11, one of the missing persons was confirmed to have been killed during the storm. About 800 people were placed in public shelters and 53,000 homes were left without running water. By August12, a total of 18 people were confirmed to {{have been killed and}} nine others were still missing. Three bridges in Tokushima were also washed away. Days later, the Japanese Fire and Disaster Management Agency finalized the death toll at 26 with one other missing, making Etau the deadliest tropical cyclone to impact Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan since Typhoon Tokage in 2004. Throughout several prefectures, 5,602 homes were flooded and 183 were destroyed. Landslides triggered by the storm damaged another 2,109 structures, most of which were in Okayama and Hyōgo prefectures. Following severe damages, in the town of Sayo it requested assistance from the national government. As a result, more than 200 troops were deployed to the town. [...] A <b>post-disaster</b> office was also set up by the prime minister's office crisis management center. An additional 400 troops were deployed to the city by August11 to assist in rescue efforts.|$|E
500|$|Hina was {{the first}} of three {{tropical}} cyclones to affect Tonga during a ten-month period, with Cyclones Keli and Ron affecting the island nation during June 1997 and January 1998. Late on March 15, ahead of the system affecting Tonga, gale warnings were issued for the Southern Tongan island groups of Haʻapai, Tongatapu and Vavaʻu. During the next day, Hina took less than two hours to inflict considerable damage on the Tongan islands and became the worst tropical cyclone to affect Tonga since Cyclone Isaac during 1982. The two worst-affected Tongan islands were Tongatapu and 'Eua after major damages were reported on both islands. As the system impacted Tonga, the FMS received several reports of one or more tornadoes occurring in Tonga; however, during a <b>post-disaster</b> survey no evidence was found to prove or disprove this claim. It was noted that several of the badly damaged houses had little or no cyclone protection while over 600 people were left homeless. Damages were greater than had been expected, with an estimated damage total of about [...] Tongan Pa'anga (...) reported. A post disaster survey attributed the greater damages to higher than expected wind gusts caused by either a low level squall or a jet streak. There were no casualties reported as the system affected the island nation, however, Vaiola Hospital reported that they had treated a number of patients for injuries that were caused during the system's aftermath. One indirect death was also reported, after a sea captain suffered a heart attack while evacuating from his home. Within the islands severe damage to power lines and telecommunication systems was reported. The system affected the islands after the lowest tide for the day, as a result sea damage was minimal, though some evidence of salt damage to taro plantations was observed.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the tornado, thousands of rescue workers dug through the wreckage looking for survivors and recovering bodies. More than 450 were originally listed as missing in the <b>post-disaster</b> chaos, leading to fears that the death toll could skyrocket to the hundreds and skepticism about the relatively low fatality figures with respect to the number of casualties. [...] Rumors abounded about refrigerated trucks being brought to store unidentified remains and countless bodies at the bottom of area bodies of water. However, the fatality figure did not increase (in fact, it decreased) and most missing persons were later found to have survived. During this period, The Tuscaloosa News posted an on-line people finder to aid loved ones and friends in finding one another and to determine who was still missing.|$|E
