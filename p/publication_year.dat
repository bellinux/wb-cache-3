5|$|The genus Mythicomyces was {{circumscribed}} in 1986 by mycologists Scott Redhead and Alexander H. Smith {{to contain the}} species originally named Agaricus corneipes by Elias Magnus Fries in 1861. Fries described the species from collections made in a fir forest near Alsike, Sweden; it was subsequently recorded in North America (northwestern USA) by Andrew Price Morgan in 1907, and several times by Smith. When listing the synonyms of the species, Redhead and Smith cited the <b>publication</b> <b>year</b> of Fries's work as 1863 instead of the correct 1861, which rendered their new combination invalid {{according to the rules}} of International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, although the generic name was valid. The binomial was subsequently published validly in 2011.|$|E

All of first edition Hobbit copies show the 1938 date on the title page, perhaps discouraging bibliographers from ascribing different printings to them.|$|E

Finally, the examples of the evaluation completed by applying the proposed rules are given.

2500|$|A 2014 {{meta-analysis}} of {{sex differences in}} scholastic achievement {{published in the journal}} of Psychological Bulletin found females outperformed males in teacher-assigned school marks throughout elementary, junior/middle, high school and at both undergraduate and graduate university level. The meta-analysis, done by researchers Daniel Voyer and Susan D. Voyer from the University of New Brunswick, drew from 97 years of 502 effect sizes and 369 samples stemming from the year 1914 to 2011, and found that higher female performance was not affected by <b>publication</b> <b>year</b> and thereby contradicted recent complaints of [...] "boy crisis" [...] in academic achievement. Another 2015 study by researchers Gijsbert Stoet and David C. Geary in Intelligence found that girl's overall education achievement is better in 70 percent of all the 47–75 countries that participated in PISA. [...] The study consisting of 1.5 million 15-year-olds found higher overall female achievement across reading, mathematics, and science literacy and better performance across 70% of participating countries including many with negative gaps in socioeconomic and gender equality, and they fell behind in only 4% of countries. Stoet and Geary concluded that sex differences in educational achievement are not reliably linked to gender equality.|$|E
