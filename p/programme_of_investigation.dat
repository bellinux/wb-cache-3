40|$|The paper forms {{part of a}} <b>programme</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> {{into the}} causes of size effects in structural-concrete behaviour.

The validity of this postulate is supported by the results-presently reported-of non-linear finite element analysis, in which the model used to describe cracking is capable of inducing non-symmetrical cracking in symmetrical structural members subjected to symmetrical loading. The results demonstrate that the package used can also provide a close fit to experimental values and, moreover, that the presence of stirrups (designed so as to prevent shear failure) is sufficient to diminish the effect of non-symmetrical cracking and hence eliminate size effects.

40|$|SYNOPSIS In {{the course}} of {{systematic}} research into the coagulative properties of cancers, facts of wider implication on the behaviour of fatty acids in relation to clotting have been uncovered. It {{has been shown that}} saturated fatty acids of appropriate chain length have a direct inhibitory effect on tissue thromboplastins with an optimum of 14 carbon atoms. Unsaturated fatty acids have a similar, though more marked, inhibitory activity with an optimum chain length of 16 carbon atoms. The inhibitory activity is reduced by combining the acids with human serum albumin. Certain fatty acids when dissolved in human serum albumin form labile thromboplastins with properties corres-ponding to those found in human cancers and in chorion. Since the discovery by one of us (O'Meara, 1958) that human cancers produce a very labile, readily diffusible, coagulative factor which leads to the formation of fibrin in advance of the tumours and, in certain circumstances, within them, a systematic <b>programme</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> has proceeded in this department to elucidate the nature and mode o...|$|E

40|$|Exhibition {{created by}} Jane Langley and Carol Swords. The paintings, {{drawings}} and artist’s book produced during this research project used the lacy teardrop {{shape of the}} popular and familiar Buta/Paisley pattern. The Buta motif, meaning ‘flower’, originated in the Safavid Dynasty of Persia (from 1501 to 1736) and was more delicate and naturalistic than its subsequent adaptation as the nineteenth century English Paisley pattern. By the early eighteenth century the motif had been conventionalised into a pyramid of flowers, which, by 1770, had transformed again into an outlined curling pointed leaf filled in with a floral pattern. Between 1800 and 1850, using Jacquard looms, the weavers {{of the town of}} Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland, adopted the design for their woollen shawls; hence the design became known as the Paisley pattern.

A <b>programme</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigations</b> in that direction is formulated.

40|$|Magnetometry and Slingram {{electromagnetic}} {{surveys were}} {{conducted at the}} UNESCO World Heritage Site of Songo Mnara, Tanzania, {{as part of a}} multi-national <b>programme</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> to examine the uses of space within and outside of this stonetown. The town was a major Islamic trading port during the 14 th and 15 th centuries. The surveys detected significant evidence for the containment of activities within the town walls, and previously unknown anthropogenic activity was revealed between the existing coral rag buildings, as well as within the open areas inside the town. Over 40 areas of magnetic disturbance were identified that corresponded directly with areas of high magnetic susceptibility in the Slingram electromagnetic in-phase responses. On excavation many of these anomalies were found to correlate with wattle and daub structures, indicating a hitherto unidentified population, and the location of the anomalies also suggests a potentially deliberate delineation of space within the open areas of the stonetown. The combined results of the three geophysical data sets indicate that there are clear delineations in the use of space within Songo Mnara. This coupled with the presence of industrial activities and evidence of more ephemeral occupation, neither of which had previously been recorded at the site, indicates that the pre-existing town plan is in need of significant reappraisal. The current plan, based upon the remains of extant and collapsed coral buildings, can now be updated to incorporate the more ephemeral aspects of Swahili sites including activity areas, and notably, the homes of the ‘hidden majority’of the population. The results establish the benefit of a combined approach at these sites, and demonstrate that further invasive and non-invasive exploration is required in order to fully exploit the significance of the role of geophysical techniques in understanding Swahili towns. ...|$|E
