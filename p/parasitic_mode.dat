We find that both Kelvin-Helmholtz and tearing mode instabilities can operate to saturate the field amplification driven by the magnetorotational instability in the dissipative regimes accessible to current numerical simulations. The value of the stresses at saturation depends critically on whether the fastest growing magnetorotational and <b>parasitic</b> <b>modes</b> can fit within the domain under consideration and whether nonaxisymmetric <b>parasitic</b> <b>modes</b> are allowed to be excited.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the stability of}} incompressible, exact, non-ideal magnetorotational (MRI) <b>modes</b> against <b>parasitic</b> instabilities. Both Kelvin-Helmholtz and tearing-mode parasitic instabilities may occur in the dissipative regimes accessible to current numerical simulations. We suppose that a primary MRI mode saturates at an amplitude such that its fastest parasite has a growth rate comparable to its own. The predicted alpha parameter then depends critically on whether the fastest primary and <b>parasitic</b> <b>modes</b> fit within the computational domain and whether non-axisymmetric <b>parasitic</b> <b>modes</b> are allowed. Hence even simulations that resolve viscous and resistive scales may not saturate properly unless the numerical domain {{is large enough to}} allow the free evolution of both MRI and <b>parasitic</b> <b>modes.</b> To minimally satisfy these requirements in simulations with vertical background fields, the vertical extent of the domain should accommodate the fastest growing MRI mode while the radial and azimuthal extents must be twice as large. The fastest parasites have horizontal wavelengths roughly twice as long as the vertical wavelength of the primary. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures, uses emulateapj.

40|$|The {{traditional}} methods of <b>parasitic</b> <b>mode</b> excitation diagnosis in an X-band triaxial klystron amplifier (TKA) meet two difficulties: limited installation space and vacuum sealing. In order to solve these issues, a simple and compact coupler with good sealing performance, which can prevent air flow between the main and the auxiliary waveguides, is proposed and investigated experimentally. The coupler is designed with the aperture diffraction theory and the finite-different time-domain (FDTD) method. The designed coupler consists of a main coaxial waveguide (for microwave transmission) and a rectangular auxiliary waveguide (for <b>parasitic</b> <b>mode</b> diagnosis). The entire coupler structure has been fabricated by macromolecule polymer which is transparent to microwave signal in frequency range of X-band. The metal coating of about 200 microns has been performed through electroplating technique {{to ensure that the}} device operates well at high power. A small aperture is made in the metal coating. Hence, microwave can couple through the hole and the wave-transparent medium, whereas air flow is blocked by the wave-transparent medium. The coupling coefficient is analyzed and simulated with CST software. The coupler model is also included in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation with CHIPIC software and the associated <b>parasitic</b> <b>mode</b> excitation is studied. A frequency component of 11. 46 GHz is observed in the FFT of the electric field of the drift tube and its corresponding competition mode appears as TE 61 mode according to the electric field distribution. Besides, a frequency component of 10. 8 GHz is also observed in the FFT of the electric field.

40|$|Superconducting quantum {{electrical}} circuit based on Co-planar waveguide technology {{is considered one}} of the most promising candidates for practical realization of a quantum computer in future. For purpose of designing a multi-qubit quantum processor which is the heart of a quantum computer, it is required to couple qubits to a large number of superconducting transmission lines and resonators. Placing all these transmission lines and resonators in a practical design unavoidably creates bending and discontinuities in the ground planes which have higher order <b>parasitic</b> <b>modes</b> that can be excited. These undesired <b>parasitic</b> <b>modes</b> are detrimental for quantum measurement, for example during readout of a qubit. Unwanted modes can easily interfere with a resonator frequency when coupling to the qubit. These <b>parasitic</b> <b>modes</b> can propagate throughout CPW structure and make unequal ground potential at the corresponding ground planes. The easiest way to suppress these <b>parasitic</b> <b>modes</b> is to connect two unequal ground potential with superconducting air-bridges in order to bring them under equal potential in superconducting state. However, connecting airbridges on top of CPW adds shunt capacitor which may cause undesired reflection in the CPW. In this thesis work, we designed superconducting air-bridges on top of superconducting CPW transmission line which is a subsystem of large quantum {{electrical circuit}}. Our focus was to reduce added shunt capacitance by choosing the right height of these air-bridges. To keep the reflection coming from the air-bridge at minimum level, an airbridge height of 8. 5 μm~ 15 μm was chosen. The performance was verified by EM simulation and these heights were selected for device fabrication. We developed a new fabrication method for processing 8. 5 μm~ 15 μm high aluminum air-bridges for quantum electrical circuits. The method is compatible with the quantum circuit and easily reproducible. Finally, input reflection measurement (S 11) at cryogenic temperature was performed for 8. 5 μm high, 300 μm long aluminum air-bridges with aluminum CPW transmission line. Negligible amount of input reflection (S 11) was observed from these measurements which is consistent with the result of EM simulation...|$|R

The components seen by the beam are designed for a small impedance {{with the help of}} computer codes and of laboratory measurements on models.

The observed <b>parasitic</b> <b>mode</b> loss, bunch lenghtening and frequency shifts of the incoherent and the quadrupole mode synchrotron oscillation give integrals over the longitudinal resistive and reactive impedances. Growth or decay rates of head-tail modes and betatron frequency shifts give corresponding information for the transverse impedance.

Coupled bunch mode instabilities are usually driven by a single, narrow band resonance and their behavior can help to identify the responsible <b>parasitic</b> <b>mode</b> in the cavities. For unbunched beams the oscillating mode gives directly the frequency of the driving resonator. The beam transfer function is a powerful tool to determine the impedance at low frequencies.

40|$|Parasitic {{strategies}} are widely distributed across the angiosperms and {{are estimated to}} have evolved at least eight different times. Within the obligate hemiparasitic and holoparasitic members, elaborate strategies for host selection have emerged. Here, we demonstrate that in the parasitic Scrophulariceae Striga asiatica, for which signal-mediated host detection is critical, expansin mRNA provides a reliable and accurate downstream molecular marker for {{the transition to the}} <b>parasitic</b> <b>mode.</b> Three different expansin genes, saExp 1, saExp 2, and saExp 3, are regulated by xenognostic quinones. saExp 3 appears to function as a seedling expansin, and its mRNA is depleted within minutes after induction of the host attachment organ. saExp 1 and saExp 2 share less homology with the known expansins, and their transcripts accumulate linearly over a critical induction period. The regulation of these genes suggests that the resources for developmental commitment must accumulate to a defined threshold before commitment to organogenesis is terminal. When the induction signal is removed prematurely, the accumulated message decays with a time constant that correlates with the time required for additional signal exposures to reinduce parasitic development. These results suggest that sophisticated controls exist for the accumulation of the necessary components for terminal commitment to the <b>parasitic</b> <b>mode.</b> Furthermore, building on the redox dependence of the inducing signal, they suggest a model akin to a “molecular capacitor” for clocking organogenesis in S. asiatica...|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the first order <b>parasitic</b> <b>mode</b> (i. e., that closest to the fundamental thickness mode) that can occur in 2 - 2 and 1 - 3 thickness drive piezoelectric composite transducers. Specifically, the authors compare the performance of piezoceramic and piezocrystal composites with a common passive phase. A local Lamb wave approach is used to describe the generation of such modes, and the validity of this theory is investigated over the entire volume fraction range. It is shown that, when the <b>parasitic</b> <b>mode</b> is primarily generated by Lamb wave activity in the passive phase, both active materials demonstrate similar behavior. However, at higher volume fractions, the first order mode is related to the lateral resonance of the active material, and quite different behavior may be observed between the two sets of devices. The phase velocity of the parasitic modes in each device configuration was investigated by a combination of experimental measurement on a number of transducers along with simulations using the finite-element code PZFlex.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, MRI-driven {{turbulent}} transport {{has been found}} to depend in a significant way on fluid viscosity ν and resistivity η through the magnetic Prandtl number Pm=ν/η. In particular, the transport decreases with decreasing Pm; if persistent at very large Reynolds numbers, this trend may lead to question the role of MRI-turbulence in YSO disks, whose Prandtl number is usually very small. In this context, the principle objective of the present investigation is to characterize in a refined way the role of dissipation. Another objective is to characterize the effect of linear (channel <b>modes)</b> and quasi-linear (<b>parasitic</b> <b>modes)</b> physics in the behavior of the transport. These objectives are addressed {{with the help of a}} number of incompressible numerical simulations. The horizontal extent of the box size has been increased in order to capture all relevant (fastest growing) linear and secondary <b>parasitic</b> unstable <b>modes.</b> The major results are the following: i- The increased accuracy in the computation of transport averages shows that the dependence of transport on physical dissipation exhibits two different regimes: for Pm ≲ 1, the transport has a power-law dependence on the magnetic Reynolds number rather than on the Prandtl number; for Pm > 1, the data are consistent with a primary dependence on Pm for large enough (∼ 10 ^ 3) Reynolds numbers. ii- The transport-dissipation correlation is not clearly or simply related to variations of the linear modes growth rates. iii- The existence of the transport-dissipation correlation depends neither on the number of linear modes captured in the simulations, nor on the effect of the <b>parasitic</b> <b>modes</b> on the saturation of the linear modes growth. iv- The transport is usually not dominated by axisymmetric (channel) modesComment: 11 pages, 9 figures.
