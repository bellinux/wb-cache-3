The theoretical part concerns itself with importance of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> in human life, particularly in a child's life, and point out to the risks and problems connected to a sedentary lifestyle. The practical part focuses on <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> of middle school students in chosen parts of the Usti Region. The questionnaire survey in this part of theses detects the extend of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> <b>and</b> differences between children living in bigger and smaller towns. Part of this passage is also mapping of current possibilities of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> <b>and</b> sports grounds in this region. Finally, there are several recommended changes presented in the paper that would lead to increase in interest of middle school students in <b>physical</b> <b>activities,</b> namely lowering prices of extracurricular <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> <b>and</b> increase in amount of school <b>physical</b> <b>activities.</b> KEYWORDS: movement, leisure time activities, health, motivatio...|$|R

The chasm between Marie and Julien, due to his corporeality and her ghostly nature, is emphasised in the contrast between his <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> her status as an onlooker. Rivette says he wanted the lovers to appear ill-suited and for the viewer to question the relationship; they love each other passionately yet they are essentially strangers. Béart believes that Marie was more alive than Julien, and that he literally wakes up to her existence only {{at the very end}} of the film.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Coffin {{fell ill}} {{with a serious}} hip {{infection}} that forced her to curtail much of her <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> required a lengthy stay in hospital. She moved to a newly acquired house in New Haven, Connecticut, although she continued to maintain her office in New York and commuted there daily. Coffin often entertained guests in New Haven (and recruited several Connecticut notables as new clients), holding teas, cocktail parties, musical events and buffet suppers. The garden, which she had laid out herself, became the site of garden parties in the summer months. She preferred the company of young architects, artists, musicians and writers, though she could be curt towards those she took a dislike to; on one occasion, she snubbed Hilaire Belloc when he asked her which of his books she had read.|$|E
5|$|The major {{differences}} in life expectancy for women between {{developed and developing}} countries lie in the childbearing years. If a woman survives this period, {{the differences between the}} two regions become less marked, since in later life non-communicable diseases (NCDs) become the major causes of death in women throughout the world, with cardiovascular deaths accounting for 45% of deaths in older women, followed by cancer (15%) and lung disease (10%). These create additional burdens on the resources of developing countries. Changing lifestyles, including diet, <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> cultural factors that favour larger body size in women, are contributing to an increasing problem with obesity and diabetes amongst women in these countries and increasing the risks of cardiovascular disease and other NCDs.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to examine the extent of students’ involvement in sports <b>and</b> recreational <b>activities</b> <b>and</b> to explore whether their behaviour reflects their attitude towards sports <b>and</b> recreational <b>activities.</b> Furthermore, we tried to examine the correlation between students’ <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> <b>and</b> the <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> of their parents, as well as the correlation between their <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> <b>and</b> the feeling of loneliness. The study was conducted on 128 fourth-year students of the Faculty of Teacher Education in Zagreb, Department Čakovec. The instruments used in the research consisted of instrument for measuring <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> of students <b>and</b> their preferences, parental behavior, the Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale adapted for the Croatian population by Ćubela, Adorić and Nekić (2004), and the Scale for measuring students’ attitudes toward sports <b>and</b> recreational <b>activities</b> constructed exclusively for the {{purpose of this}} investigation. The results show that 55. 5 % of students are not involved in any sports and/or recreational activities in their free time. Also, no correlation was found between students’ attitudes <b>and</b> their <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> nor any correlation between their <b>and</b> maternal <b>physical</b> <b>activities.</b> A low but significant correlation was found between students’ <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> <b>and</b> their father’s involvement in <b>physical</b> <b>activities,</b> but no correlation between student’s <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> with any of the three facets of loneliness (social, emotional and family) was confirmed...|$|R

5|$|While the {{detection}} of Mups excreted by other animals has been well studied, the functional role in the producing animal is less clear. However, in 2009, Mups were shown {{to be associated with}} the regulation of energy expenditure in mice. Scientists found that genetically induced obese, diabetic mice produce thirty times less Mup RNA than their lean siblings. When they delivered Mup protein directly into the bloodstream of these mice, they observed an increase in energy expenditure, <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> body temperature and a corresponding decrease in glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. They propose that Mups' beneficial effects on energy metabolism occurs by enhancing mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. Another study found Mups were reduced in diet-induced obese mice. In this case, the presence of Mups in the bloodstream of mice restricted glucose production by directly inhibiting the expression of genes in the liver.|$|E
