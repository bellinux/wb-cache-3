5|$|The {{appeal is}} based upon fresh {{evidence}} that was not available at the original trial, it is hoped the conviction will be quashed and a retrial ordered... Upon his conviction, Mr Park's family and friends launched a campaign to clear his name, claiming there was no single <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> pointed indisputably to him.|$|E
5|$|When {{trying to}} explain past phenomena, paleontologists and other {{historical}} scientists often construct a set of hypotheses about the causes and then look for a smoking gun, a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> indicates that one hypothesis is a better explanation than others. Sometimes the smoking gun is discovered by a fortunate accident during other research. For example, the discovery by Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez of an iridium-rich layer at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary made asteroid impact and volcanism the most favored explanations for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.|$|E
5|$|In the {{courtroom}} trials, the player aims {{to prove their}} clients' innocence. In order to do so, they cross-examine witnesses; during these cross-examinations, the player aims to find lies and inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimonies. They are {{able to go back}} and forth between the different statements in the testimony, and can press the witness for more details on a statement. When the player finds an inconsistency, they can present a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> contradicts the statement. In the Nintendo DS version, the player can choose to press and present by using vocal commands, and in the Wii version, players have the option to present evidence by swinging the Wii Remote. At certain points, the player has to answer questions from the judge, the witnesses, or the prosecutor through a multiple-choice answer selection, or by presenting evidence that supports Phoenix's claims. On the screen, a number of exclamation marks are shown; if the player presents an incorrect piece of evidence, one of the exclamation marks disappear. If all disappear, the client is found guilty and the player must restart. When the player solves a case, they unlock a new one to play.|$|E

25|$|The one <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> {{could have}} shown {{which one is}} correct was the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). However, this device was {{defective}} and failed to record anything. Also, the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) was an older model that only recorded 4 parameters. It {{was scheduled to be}} replaced a few weeks later.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} with this plural {{use of the}} word, in a 1954 article written by Arnold Field, {{a reporter for the}} Daily Dispatch, Gardner had apparently explained to him that [...] "there are man and woman witches.

It is possible that Field misunderstood what Gardner was saying by not capitalising Wica, and that therefore Gardner might have never used Wica in a singular sense.|$|E

500|$|In the {{courtroom}} trials, the player aims {{to get their}} client declared [...] "not guilty". To do so, they cross-examine witnesses, and aim to find lies and inconsistencies in the testimonies. They are {{able to go back}} and forth between the different statements in the testimony, and can press the witness for more details on a statement. When the player finds an inconsistency, they can present a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> contradicts the statement. The player is penalized if they present incorrect evidence: in the first game, a number of exclamation marks is shown, with one disappearing after each mistake the player makes; in later games, a health bar that represents the judge's patience is used instead. If all exclamation marks are lost, or the health bar reaches zero, the player loses the game and their client is declared guilty.|$|E
500|$|The trial {{portions}} {{consist of}} listening to and cross-examining witness testimonies. The player is given the option to either Press or Present evidence in response to statements made by witnesses. The player can either select their choice or yell into the microphone. By choosing Press, the player questions the witness's statement, which sometimes causes the witness to change their testimony. When finding inconsistencies in the testimony, the player may choose Present {{in order to show}} a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> they think contradicts the testimony. The player has a health bar, representing the judge's patience. If the player presents incorrect pieces of evidence or choose incorrect answers to questions in court, health is lost. If the health bar reaches zero, the player loses the game and their client is declared guilty. A new system, known as the [...] "Perceive System," [...] can be used to look for motions or actions made by witnesses that show nervousness, similar to a tell in poker. The game also includes a [...] "Crime Recreation Mode" [...] that models evidence or the crime scene in a 3-D rendition and allow the player to explore the recreation to look for clues. Additionally, the game often recreates the crime in cutscene sequences, allowing the player to observe the action and find contradictions.|$|E
500|$|Today this theory, {{as well as}} Lauer and Firths' conclusions, {{is widely}} questioned. Archaeological {{evidence}} of Peribsen has almost entirely been found in Upper Egypt. In particular, his name {{does not appear in}} Lower Egyptian records surviving from that time. It is argued that Peribsen may not have ruled over all of Egypt and therefore did not have the authority to force a change in state religion. Another <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> argues against the [...] "heretic Peribsen" [...] theory is the false door of the priest Shery at Saqqara. Shery held office during the early Fourth dynasty. The inscription on the false door connects the name of Peribsen in one sentence with another shadowy king of the Second dynasty, Senedj. According to the addendum, Shery was [...] "overseer of all wab-priests of king Peribsen in the necropolis of king Senedj, in his mortuary temple and at all other places". This implies that the funerary cult of Peribsen continued at least until the Fourth dynasty, inconsistent with the assumption that Peribsen's name was not allowed to be mentioned. Additionally, Egyptologists such as Herman te Velde point out that Shery was not the only Fourth dynasty priest participating in the funerary cult of Peribsen. Inkef, possibly a brother or cousin of Shery, also held the title of a [...] "supervisor of Ka-priests of Peribsen".|$|E

50|$|All the {{evidence}} gathered so far is, then, {{expelled from the}} defendant's file, with the exception <b>of</b> those <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> cannot be repeated, such as the initial autopsy or a search and seizure, or that were gathered in the defendant's presence and in that of his lawyer or his experts.|$|R
50|$|There is also several <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> {{promotes}} {{the idea of}} transcription factories assembling de novo due to transcriptional demands.

500|$|Gordon {{was again}} arrested on 13 January 2004. Police {{said at the}} time that the murder file had never been closed, and that the arrest {{followed}} new leads. These new leads were later reported to be a confession by Michael Wainwright, who claimed to have been a cellmate of Gordon's during his short prison stay in 1997. The police then revisited the site where the body was discovered, and found a piece of Westmorland green slate, a stone that matched the rocks that made up the wall of the family's bungalow. The case was brought to trial at Manchester Crown Court, and lasted ten weeks. There was no single <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> pointed to Gordon indisputably, but the prosecution argued that when the evidence was placed together, it could only point at Park, and not a [...] "mysterious stranger or secret lover". Primarily, the case for the prosecution rested on circumstantial evidence, with the jury being asked to consider knots, rocks used to weight down the body and the ice axe, all linking Gordon Park to the crime. However, the statements of Michael Wainwright, and another of Gordon's cellmates, who had learning difficulties, were also used as evidence by the prosecution. He was sentenced to be jailed for life, and told that he must serve at least 15 years. The judge said that he had taken into account the [...] "terrible concealment" [...] of the body.|$|E
500|$|On 8 December 2009, General Walter Natynczyk {{testified before}} a {{parliamentary}} committee that one particular detainee that was abused on 14 June 2006 by Afghan police {{was never in}} CF custody. [...] Canada's chief commander stated that although CF members had questioned the man, he {{was taken into custody}} by Afghan police, and Canadian troops rescued him when the police started beating him with their shoes. However, the general corrected himself the following day upon receiving new information that the man had in fact been in Canadian custody. This would be the first <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Afghan detainees in Canadian custody were subsequently abused by Afghan officials, contrary to government claims that there was no such evidence. It prompted opposition MPs to recall for a public inquiry into the matter, and for Peter MacKay to be fired. Canada's top military commander subsequently ordered an inquiry to find out why he had not been informed about this incident. This inquiry revealed many Canadian soldiers were aware that Afghan security forces beat prisoners [...] "in the street and elsewhere" [...] on a regular basis. [...] A separate report to General Natynczyk also concluded that the detainee beaten in June 2006 was not defined as a Canadian detainee, preventing it from being reported up the chain of command, and that the CF and Department of Defence should “be tasked to examine the detainee reporting process...to develop one consolidated process for the reporting on [...] detainees.” ...|$|E
2500|$|However, the {{assertion}} that Morrison was employed by Pepper, and named the drink after him, is disputed. Milly Walker, Collections Manager / Curator for the Dublin (Texas) Dr Pepper Bottling Co.

5000|$|Kim {{claimed that}} he had been {{planning}} to end Park's dictatorship for seven years (The Yusin Constitution of 1972 was ratified seven years before that). He {{claimed that he}} attempted to assassinate Park three times: in 1974 and twice in 1979. There are some <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> partially corroborate these statements, which will be discussed later.|$|R

30|$|The Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) stated <b>that</b> {{there are}} <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> dealing with very small {{nanoparticles}} sized 10  nm or less, {{it is possible}} to observe the skin penetration into viable tissue. However, when dealing with nanoparticles larger than 20  nm in diameter, they can penetrate deeply into the hair follicle, but not reach viable tissue (SEC 2008).|$|R
2500|$|The Guilford branch was {{authorised}} with {{a triangular}} junction, and the earthworks for the Shepherdswell-facing curve were completed. [...] There is one intriguing <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the track for this triangular junction was briefly in use. Early photos of Locomotive No. 1 show it either facing Shepherdswell or Wingham; the EKLR had literally nowhere on its system where a locomotive {{could be turned}} except for this triangle! Not {{to be confused with}} another proposed triangle at Eythorne, from the proposed Deal line to Elvington to give a direct route from Canterbury to Deal. No work was done on this.|$|E
2500|$|Khadr {{remains a}} {{controversial}} figure. Canadian attorney Dennis Edney, {{lawyer for the}} Khadr family, has challenged the assumption that Khadr {{was a member of}} al-Qaeda, saying in 2001 that he was [...] "really interested in obtaining one <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> would show indeed that Mr. Khadr was actually a terrorist. To me, it's just folklore." [...] Khadr's imam in Canada, Ali Hindy, spoke after his death, saying [...] "I don't think that he was al-Qaeda, but I think he felt that now he became part of Afghanistan." [...] His friends described him as being [...] "proud of [...] Canadian citizen". Some politicians and media have suggested that he disliked the country.|$|E
2500|$|The second <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> {{comes from}} Patrick's {{life is the}} Letter to Coroticus or Letter to the Soldiers of Coroticus, written after a first remonstrance was {{received}} with ridicule and insult. In this, Saint Patrick writes an open letter announcing that he has excommunicated Coroticus because he had taken some of Saint Patrick's converts into slavery while raiding in Ireland. The letter describes the followers of Coroticus as [...] "fellow citizens of the devils" [...] and [...] "associates of the Scots [...] and Apostate Picts". Based largely on an eighth-century gloss, Coroticus is taken to be King Ceretic of Alt Clut. Thompson however proposed that {{based on the evidence}} {{it is more likely that}} Coroticus was a British Roman living in Ireland. It has been suggested that it was the sending of this letter which provoked the trial which Patrick mentions in the Confession.|$|E
30|$|As in {{the case}} of immigrants, while these {{findings}} are consistent with an effect of culture, they could also reflect the effect of other unobservables. However, we examined a number <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> suggest our findings for second generation women’s fertility and labor supply are due at least in part to intergenerational transmission of gender roles, rather than other unobservables.|$|R
50|$|Camm {{became a}} suspect {{because of an}} {{interpretation}} of bloodstain patterns on his clothing {{as well as a}} number <b>of</b> leads and <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> were later found to be unreliable or outright false. He was tried and found guilty of the murders. In 2004 the conviction was overturned on the grounds that testimony about his marital infidelity had been prejudicial.|$|R
50|$|One <b>of</b> {{the strongest}} <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> {{supports}} this model {{was a study}} conducted by Ekman and Friesen (1971), where members of a preliterate tribe in Papua New Guinea reliably recognized the facial expressions of individuals from the United States. Culturally isolated and with no exposure to US media, there was no possibility of cross-cultural transmission to the Papuan tribesmen.|$|R
2500|$|State's Attorney Lawson Lamar said, [...] "We're {{disappointed}} in the verdict today because we know the facts and we've put in absolutely every <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> existed. This is a dry-bones case. Very, very difficult to prove. The delay in recovering little Caylee's remains worked to our considerable disadvantage." [...] Jose Baez said, [...] "While we're happy for Casey, there are no winners in this case. Caylee has passed on far, far too soon, and what my driving force {{has been for the}} last three years has been always to make sure that there has been justice for Caylee and Casey because Casey did not murder Caylee. It's that simple." [...] He added, [...] "And today our system of justice has not dishonored her memory by a false conviction." [...] Former Casey Anthony defense attorney Linda Kenney Baden shared Baez's sentiments. She believes the jury reached the right verdict. [...] "We should embrace their verdict," [...] she stated.|$|E
2500|$|... that (in a {{revision}} of the Franciscan Thesis) the genre of meditations {{on the life of}} Christ, and, especially, the pseudo-Bonaventurian Meditationes vitae Christi, are evidence for [...] "a tradition of affective meditation among women.' [...] She argues that [...] "the original version of the Meditations was a short Italian text composed by one nun for another" [...] that was then expanded, translated into Latin, and corrected by a male, Franciscan redactor (95–96). Her detailed research on this was published as an article in 2009. This thesis has not been accepted by all readers. A research group in the Program of Italian Literature and Culture at the Eötvös Loránd University of Budapest, while not disagreeing with McNamer, speculates on what detailed collation of the Latin Text and all the extant Italian texts might show, especially since such a collation was not part of her project. Michelle Karnes, however, includes in a footnote the observation, [...] "McNamer has suggested that the Meditationes vitae Christi was written by a woman, but she provides only one <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> is far from conclusive to support the claim (Affective Meditation, 110– 15). It is more likely that the author was male." ...|$|E
6000|$|This rests {{upon the}} {{evidence}} of two eye-witnesses,(1) and the circumstance has been urged and propounded into the one conclusive <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Cesare had murdered his brother, and that the Pope knew it. In this you have some more of what Gregorovius terms [...] "inexorable logic." [...] He kissed him, but he spake no word to him; therefore, they reason, Cesare murdered Gandia. Can absurdity be more absurd, fatuity more fatuous? Lucus a non lucendo! To square the circle should surely present no difficulty to these subtle logicians.|$|E
