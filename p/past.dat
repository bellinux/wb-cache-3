We start giving a summary of {{previous}} results concerning to <b>Pasting</b> and Reversing over vectors and matrices, after we rewrite such properties of <b>Pasting</b> and Reversing in matrix theory using linear mappings to finish with new properties and new sets in matrix theory involving <b>Pasting</b> and Reversing. In particular we introduce new linear mappings: Palindromicing and Antipalindromicing mappings, which allow us to obtain palindromic and antipalindromic vectors and matrices. Comment: 19 page...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In this paper, an {{adaptive}} semi-blind multiuser detection (MUD) algorithm based on improved projecting approximation subspace tracking with deflation (<b>PASTd)</b> subspace tracking is proposed for multicarrier code {{division multiple access}} (MC-CDMA) uplink where the base station receiver has the knowledge of the spreading sequences of all the users within the cell, but not that of the users from other cells. It is known that the <b>PASTd</b> algorithm has the drawback of slow convergence rate. Based on this, we develop an improved <b>PASTd</b> algorithm and apply it to the adaptive linear hybrid semi-blind multiuser detection. The improved <b>PASTd</b> algorithm guarantees the orthonormality between the estimated eigenvectors such that a fast convergence rate can be achieved. Simulation results show the proposed semi-blind MUD has a fast convergence rate and provides the similar output signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) and bit error rate (BER) as the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) semi-blind MUD...|$|R
