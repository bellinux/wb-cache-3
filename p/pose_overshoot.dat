40|$|The Diploma Thesis {{focuses on}} {{examination}} of most suitable optionsof movement regulation of pendent object {{from the perspective}} of various requirements on the course of the process as such. The environment of Matlab-Simulink was used for the analysis. The first part of the Thesis deals with the creation of the model of the whole system and creation of additional models of systems with similar, highly oscillating behaviour. The central part of the Thesis focuses on the design of suitable methods of movement regulation during translocation of the pendent object, which is tested on a simple model of travelling monkey. Four approaches to the problem solving were chosen: simple regulation by PID regulator, branched regulation, state regulation and predicative regulation. All solving options are being analysed and optimised and their results mutually compared according to requirements defined, such as: speed of the process, fluency of the movement, small <b>pose</b> <b>overshoot</b> or small angle of rope deflection...|$|E
