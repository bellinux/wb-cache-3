40|$|Abstract — The {{steadily}} decreasing cost of Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) technology motivates {{the concept}} of pseudocellular networks that support real-time traffic and seamless mobility with WLAN-type infrastructure, {{in addition to the}} standard low-mobility data applications of WLANs. A key challenge in such networks is the support of highly mobile users with real-time traffic, because of the high handoff rate resulting from small cell sizes. In this paper, we show that timely mobile-centric handoffs can be achieved using optimized ALOHA-like reservation schemes which, for a given call drop probability, require significantly fewer reservation resources than conventional methods. For <b>Poisson</b> handoff <b>traffic,</b> we employ dynamic programming to derive an optimal stationary policy. We then use these results as a building block for obtaining adaptive reservation schemes (dynamically varying the number of minislots per frame) for bursty handoff traffic. I...|$|R
40|$|Contention {{resolution}} {{is a major}} issue in bufferless optical burst switching (OBS) networks. The existing contention resolution schemes consider priority and arrival time to resolve contention. For most multimedia applications priority and delay are key parameters for QoS provisioning. In this paper, we propose a new signaling protocol for reducing contention in OBS networks and consider three parameters, namely, priority of the burst, number of hops traversed, and burst size into account to resolve contention. The source node in the proposed protocol can be informed of the contention up to halfway along the path of the burst, and thus, can reschedule the burst accordingly. The scheme is adaptable to both prioritized and delay constrained traffic. We call the scheme OBS-F lex. For selecting a data channel, we propose three channel selection algorithms, namely, Least Recently Used (LRU), First Fit (FF), and Priority Set (PS). We simulate OBS-F lex and compare with preemptive priority just-enough-time (PPJET) contention resolution scheme. We show that OBS-F lex outperforms PPJET in terms of burst loss rates. For simulation, we have considered <b>Poisson</b> and bursty <b>traffic</b> models.

30|$|From {{this set}} of {{simulations}} (Figure 7), it can be observed for the case of MSPs equal to 50 [*]ms that, whatever the external network load, the average packet delay is always kept below than deadline. In the case of MSPs equal to 5 [*]ms, the average packet delay is kept below the deadline only up to 20 RT stations. On the other hand, the average packet delay is almost independent {{of the number of}} external ST stations. The main reason for this behavior is the higher priority traffic of ST not being always active (ON/OFF behavior) and therefore the level of interference with the RT traffic is much smaller. Remember that for this simulation scenario the ST stations do not generate any voice packet during the listening (OFF) period (1.35 [*]s), while in the previous scenario they generate <b>Poisson</b> distributed <b>traffic</b> in the voice AC category.|$|R
