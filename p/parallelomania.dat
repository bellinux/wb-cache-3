Thomas Schreiner (Southern Baptist Theological Seminary) applies it to over-generalization of the simple use of the verb [...] "see" [...] used as a participle to refer to a casual act of observation, to extending its meaning to have deeper spiritual contexts in order to construct parallels. Jewish scholar Jacob Neusner has stated that some portrayals of Aphrahat as someone who cherry picked from Rabbinical literature are based on weak parallels which fall within Sandmel's characterization of <b>parallelomania.</b> Joseph Fitzmyer, SJ states the analyses of the Pauline Epistles have at times suffered from <b>parallelomania</b> through the construction of unwarranted analogies with prior traditions. Gerald O'Collins, SJ states that most scholars are now aware of the pitfalls of <b>parallelomania</b> which exaggerate the importance of trifling resemblances.|$|E

5000|$|While {{the concept}} of a [...] "dying-and-rising god" [...] has a longer history, it was {{significantly}} advocated by Frazer's Golden Bough (1906 - 1914). At first received very favourably, the idea was attacked by Roland de Vaux in 1933, and was the subject of controversial debate over the following decades.One of the leading scholars in the deconstruction of Frazer's [...] "dying-and-rising god" [...] category was Jonathan Z. Smith, whose 1969 dissertation discusses Frazer's Golden Bough, and who in Mircea Eliade's 1987 Encyclopedia of religion wrote the [...] "Dying and rising gods" [...] entry, where he dismisses the category as [...] "largely a misnomer based on imaginative reconstructions and exceeding late or highly ambiguous texts", suggesting a more detailed categorisation into [...] "dying gods" [...] and [...] "disappearing gods", arguing that before Christianity, the two categories were distinct and gods who [...] "died" [...] did not return, and those who returned never truly [...] "died".Smith gave a more detailed account of his views specifically on the question of parallels to Christianity in Drudgery Divine (1990).Smith's 1987 article was widely received, and during the 1990s, scholarly consensus seemed to shift towards his rejection of the concept as oversimplified, although it continued to be invoked by scholars writing about Ancient Near Eastern mythology.As of 2009, the Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion summarizes the current scholarly consensus as ambiguous, with some scholars rejecting Frazer's [...] "broad universalist category" [...] preferring to emphasize the differences between the various traditions, while others continue to view the category as applicable. Gerald O'Collins states that surface-level application of analogous symbolism is a case of <b>parallelomania</b> which exaggerate the importance of trifling resemblances, long abandoned by mainstream scholars.|$|E
40|$|Alleging {{parallels}} between Scripture and other ancient Near Eastern texts {{has always been}} a matter of controversy. The controversy has resulted from criticism of the comparative method by those who accuse its users of being overly simplistic or reckless when applying their particular approaches to the texts. This recklessness has resulted in alleged connections that are now considered very loose, unjustified, and harmful to the context of Scripture. In order to avoid the dreaded 2 ̆ 2 <b>parallelomania</b> 2 ̆ 2 that has resulted from hasty conclusions in comparative studies, it is necessary to approach alleged comparative units in a more concrete fashion, synthesizing the best of past approaches and cautiously utilizing those approaches when arriving at conclusions. The comparative element under discussion in this paper is that of divine cloud-riding, and the texts under consideration are Psalm 104 : 3 and the Ugaritic Epic of Baal. Both the Hebrew Bible and the Ugaritic texts describe Yahweh/Baal as a rider of the clouds. The mythopoetical motif of cloud-riding can be seen in many ancient Near Eastern texts where a storm god races through the heavens on his or her angelic cloud-chariot. This is true also of portions of the Hebrew Bible that describe Yahweh as one 2 ̆ 2 who makes the clouds his chariot, who walks on the wings of the wind 2 ̆ 2 (Ps 104 : 3). Since Ugarit is, in literature, Israel 2 ̆ 7 s most significant Canaanite neighbor, it becomes a matter of interest when Baal is called repeatedly 2 ̆ 2 the Rider of the Clouds 2 ̆ 2 in his respective texts. Is there a legitimate parallel between the Yahwistic motif of cloud-riding and the northern Canaanite expression 2 ̆ 2 Rider of the Clouds 2 ̆ 2 ? If so, what is to be made of this parallel and what were the psalmist 2 ̆ 7 s intentions by including Baal-like language in his description of Yahweh...|$|E
