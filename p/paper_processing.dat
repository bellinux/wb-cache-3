25|$|The World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) in {{collaboration}} with local partners, is developing a water fund to finance responsible watershed management in Guatemala’s Sierra de las Minas Biosphere. Known as the 'water fund', water users which include bottling companies, distilleries, hydroelectric plants, and <b>paper</b> <b>processing</b> mills are showing their awareness that water is a strategic resource whose conservation must be planned for the long term, by making significant financial contributions towards environmental services in the region. The fund is meant to encourage short-term investments to optimize industrial water use {{as a means of}} reducing effluents to the Motagua and Polochic Rivers.|$|E

2500|$|In Chester, east-west {{streets are}} numbered, while north-south streets carry names. The main {{bisecting}} street, known as The Avenue of the States south of 9th Street and Edgmont Avenue north of it, is signed as both Pennsylvania Route 320 (southbound only; northbound PA Rt. 320 uses adjacent Madison Street to Interstate 95) and Pennsylvania Route 352. North of I-95, State Route 320 follows Providence Avenue. [...] Between 1993 and 2006, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) widened and realigned Pennsylvania Route 291 from Trainer to Eddystone from a two-lane roadway to a five-lane roadway. [...] This widening and realignment project, spearheaded {{by the late}} State Senator Clarence D. Bell of Upland, allows PA Route 291 to maintain at least two travel lanes in each direct between the refinery towns of Marcus Hook and Trainer and the Philadelphia International Airport, as well as promote the riverfront development in the city. [...] Prior to the realignment, which was done first, the roadway followed 2nd Street to Crosby Street, then bore right onto E. 4th Street, widening to four lanes and becoming the [...] "Industrial Highway" [...] in Eddystone. [...] Post-realignment, the road now follows W. 2nd Street to Concord Avenue, becoming the [...] "Industrial Highway" [...] past Concord Avenue and bypassing the Kimberly-Clark (formerly Scott <b>Paper)</b> <b>processing</b> facility.|$|E
