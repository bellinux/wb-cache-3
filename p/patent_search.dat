25|$|The Archibald S. Alexander Library in New Brunswick is {{the oldest}} and the largest library of the University, and houses an {{extensive}} humanities and social science collection. It also supports the work of faculty and staff at four professional schools: the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, the Graduate School of Education, the Graduate School of Social Work, and the School of Communication and Information. Alexander Library is also a Federal Depository Library, maintaining a large collection of government documents, which contains United States, New Jersey, foreign, and international government publications. The Library of Science and Medicine (LSM) on the Busch Campus in Piscataway houses the University's collection in behavioral, biological, earth, and pharmaceutical sciences and engineering. LSM {{also serves as a}} designated depository library for government publication regarding science, and owns a U.S. patent collection and <b>patent</b> <b>search</b> facility. It was officially established as the Library of Science and Medicine in July 1964 although the beginning of the development of a library for science started in 1962. The current character of LSM is a university science library also serving a medical school. On the New Brunswick-Piscataway campus, in addition to Alexander Library, many individual disciplines have their own libraries, including Alcohol Studies, Art History, Chemistry, Mathematics, Music, and Physics. Special Collections and University Archives houses the Sinclair New Jersey Collection, manuscript collection, and rare book collection, as well as the University Archives. Although located in the Alexander Library building, Special Collections and University Archives actually comprises a distinct unit unto itself. Also located within the Alexander Library is the East Asian Library which holds a sizable collection of Chinese, Japanese and Korean monographs and periodicals. In Newark, the John Cotton Dana Library, which includes the Institute of Jazz Studies, and the Paul Robeson Library in Camden, serve their respective campuses with a broad collection of volumes. Individual items and collections within the Libraries can be identified using the Rutgers University Library Catalog.|$|E

However, Square did not publish further news, and the American trademark Chrono Break was eventually dropped on November 13, 2003.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to concerns of biopiracy raised by research into turmeric, neem and basmati rice, the Government of India has been translating and publishing ancient manuscripts containing old remedies in electronic form, and in 2001 the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library {{was set up}} as a repository of 1200 formulations of various systems of Indian medicine, such as Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha. The texts are being recorded from Tamil, Sanskrit, Urdu, Persian and Arabic; made available to patent offices in English, German, French, Japanese and Spanish. The aim is to protect India's heritage from being exploited by foreign companies. Hundreds of yoga poses are also kept in the collection. The project has been criticized by {{a spokesman for the}} pharmaceutical industry as [...] "a solution in search of a problem". The library has also signed agreements with leading international patent offices such as European Patent Office (EPO), United Kingdom Trademark & Patent Office (UKTPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark Office to protect traditional knowledge from biopiracy as it allows patent examiners at International Patent Offices to access TKDL databases for <b>patent</b> <b>search</b> and examination purposes. [...] The database is not available to the general public, but the articles to which it refers are (though typically in a not widely understood language such as Sanskrit).

40|$|Investors are {{becoming}} increasingly savvy in this knowledge economy. A noticeable trend has emerged within the patenting arena in which those seeking to acquire, license or invest in patented technology are asking more focused and detailed questions {{in order to assess}} whether commitment is warranted. Being satiated with superficial or incomplete information or having lax attitudes towards patent portfolio appropriation {{are becoming}} a distant memory, as more realize that by thoroughly scrutinizing patent rights before purchase, the exposure to infringement risks or the risk of purchasing a "lemon" can be mitigated. Scrutinizing a patent portfolio to determine if it is a worthwhile investment involves conducting patent due diligence. Different types of <b>patent</b> <b>searches</b> are required at each of the four steps of due diligence and these include <b>patent</b> family <b>searching,</b> <b>patent</b> status <b>searching,</b> <b>patent</b> validity <b>searching</b> and <b>patent</b> infringement <b>searching.</b> A practical guide to each as well as their interrelationship is presented herein, as these types of searches pave the way towards identifying both {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} a patent portfolio.
