40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} concept and {{historical}} development of <b>projective</b> <b>techniques.</b> It considers why, {{given the importance of}} their psychoanalytical foundations to the underlying paradigms of management theory, they have been generally marginalised as a mainstream business and management research tool. <b>Projective</b> <b>techniques</b> are defined and their historical origins delineated. This is followed by an overview of projective ‘types’. Some of the general advantages and current issues associated with employing <b>projective</b> <b>techniques</b> are also presented. Thereafter a discussion of the reasons <b>projective</b> <b>techniques</b> have not been widely adopted by positivist academic management researchers is made. We put forward the central argument that since many of the challenges facing management research are due to the restrictions introduced by bounded rationality, <b>projective</b> <b>techniques</b> offer a possible alternative to traditional mixed methods. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{sentence}} completion {{method of}} studying personality is a semi structured <b>projective</b> <b>technique</b> {{in which the}} subject is asked to finish a sentence for which the first word or words are supplied. As in other projective devices, {{it is assumed that}} the subject reflects his own wishes, desires, fears and attitudes in the sentences he makes. Historically, the incomplete sentence method is related most closely to the word association test. In some test incomplete sentences tests only a single word or brief response is called for; the major differences appears to be in the length of the stimulus. In the sentence completion tests, tendencies to block and to twist the meaning of the stimulus words appear and the responses may be categorized in a somewhat similar fashion to the word association method.|$|E

40|$|M. Comm. The {{assessment}} and measurement of positive psychology {{have been largely}} survey driven, given {{the way in which}} this domain’s focus areas have been operationalised. The disadvantage of using surveys in the measurement of positive psychology is that measurement is to an extent ‘disembodied’ in this approach, meaning that positive psychology is reduced to a mental activity – something which implies the negation of the physical. The {{purpose of the study was}} therefore to explore to what extent an alternative instrument, the Positivity <b>Projective</b> <b>Technique</b> (PPT), based on embodiment theory, serves as a valid <b>projective</b> <b>technique</b> for eliciting positivity. Data were collected by means of a sentence completion technique (SCT) whereafter it was quantitatively (to a limited extent) and qualitatively analysed by means of a content analysis. The results were similar to, but greater in number than, the variables proposed by formal theories/models of positivity. Given the results, the PPT seems to be a valid <b>projective</b> <b>technique</b> of positivity and may be applied for positive developmental purposes within individual, organisational and consumer contexts...|$|E

40|$|The work {{focuses on}} {{qualitative}} research of possibilities {{and limits of}} the use of picture cards symbols (including Tarot) that would serve the clients in coaching and therapy as a <b>projective</b> <b>technique</b> leading to their deeper self-knowledge and personal development.

The simple clients' description of the selected images did not bring them much substantially new. It began to be more inspirational for them when a consultant added targeted questions, his reflections and hypothetical interpretations, or even explained standard meanings of symbols. Then this technique started to speak to clients more and brought them new impulses. Even more inspiring for them it became, once an element of chance was incorporated - when they pulled out some cards at random.

A shortcoming of the standard approaches is that they fail to measure or investigate deeper perceptions of the policy. In this paper the usefulness of <b>projective</b> <b>techniques</b> {{as a tool for}} policy {{evaluation is}} investigated. <b>Projective</b> <b>techniques</b> are widely used in psychology and consumer studies but their usefulness in policy evaluation has still to be assessed. A simple evaluation is done in this paper by reporting on a study of owner‐managers of tradeable‐services small and medium size enterprises attitudes to government e‐business policy. The survey included firms from Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and New Zealand. Traditional quantitative and qualitative survey techniques were used, however these failed to produce conclusive evidence. To overcome this limitation two projective techniques—word association and completion tests—were employed as an additional evaluation method. The paper illustrates how the results of <b>projective</b> <b>techniques</b> can be analysed using both context and matrix analysis. Given that the area of e‐business is dynamic and fast changing and that SMEs are extremely heterogeneous, it is argued that the application of <b>projective</b> <b>techniques</b> to assess their attitudes and perceptions of government policy is a good test of the usefulness of the method. The results of the <b>projective</b> <b>techniques</b> lead to more insight into the perceptions and attitudes of the owner‐managers and provide interesting individual perspectives into the issues. Problems with the method, such as costs, the level of skill needed to apply the technique and generalization are highlighted. The overall conclusions are that <b>projective</b> <b>techniques</b> could provide an interesting additional tool for policy evaluation and that further assessment of its usefulness is needed.

Hence, this research was performed based on the Theory of Social Representations, in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, with 30 women. The technique consisted of offering modeling dough to women who, while handling it, brought the significance of the contamination of human breast milk by virus, reporting it verbally. The results showed that women expressed not only tactile sensations but also visual and emotional sensations, materialized in the modeling, presenting the meaning immersed in their imaginary.

The terms thus elicited were classified into two preestablished categories: product attributes (this cup is modern) and evocations (this cup reminds me of family time). We then proposed sub-categories: ten for product attributes and five for evocations. The methods were compared according to the number of different variables generated in each sub-category. The ease of implementation and pragmatic considerations relative to the methods are also presented. The test methods enabled the elicitation of different subjective dimensions distributed into several pre-defined categories. According to our criteria, the word association and sentence completion method appeared to be the most comprehensive technique to identify subjective dimensions...|$|E
