25|$|In every {{published}} {{fusion power}} plant design, {{the part of the}} plant that produces the fusion reactions is much more expensive than the part that converts the nuclear power to electricity. In that case, as indeed in most power systems, <b>power</b> <b>density</b> is an important characteristic. Doubling <b>power</b> <b>density</b> at least halves the cost of electricity. In addition, the confinement time required depends on the <b>power</b> <b>density.</b>|$|E
25|$|Supercapacitors {{bridge the}} gap between {{conventional}} capacitors and rechargeable batteries. They have the highest available capacitance values per unit volume and the greatest energy density of all capacitors. They support up to 12,000 Farads/1.2 Volt, with capacitance values up to 10,000 times that of electrolytic capacitors. While existing supercapacitors have energy densities that are approximately 10% of a conventional battery, their <b>power</b> <b>density</b> is generally 10 to 100 times greater. <b>Power</b> <b>density</b> is defined as the product of energy density, multiplied by the speed at which the energy is delivered to the load. The greater <b>power</b> <b>density</b> results in much shorter charge/discharge cycles than a battery is capable, and a greater tolerance for numerous charge/discharge cycles. This makes them well-suited for parallel connection with batteries, and may improve battery performance in terms of <b>power</b> <b>density.</b>|$|E
40|$|Cellulose {{has been}} used in two-chamber {{microbial}} fuel cells (MFCs), but <b>power</b> <b>densities</b> were low. Higher <b>power</b> <b>densities</b> can be achieved in air-cathode MFCs using an inoculum from a two-chamber, aqueous-cathode microbial electrolysis cell (MEC). Air-cathode MFCs with this inoculum produced maximum <b>power</b> <b>densities</b> of 1070 mWm- 2 (cathode surface area) in single-chamber and 880 mWm- 2 in two-chamber MFCs. Coulombic efficiencies ranged from 25 % to 50 %, and COD removals were 50 - 70 % based on total cellulose removals of 60 - 80 %. Decreasing the reactor volume from 26 to 14 mL (while maintaining constant electrode spacing) decreased power output by 66 % (from 526 to 180 mWm- 2) due to a reduction in total mass of cellulose added. These results demonstrate that air-cathode MFCs can produce high <b>power</b> <b>densities</b> with cellulose following proper acclimation of the inoculum, and that organic loading rates are important for maximizing <b>power</b> <b>densities</b> from particulate substrates. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|When a {{pulsed laser}} beam strikes {{the surface of}} an {{absorbing}} material, ultrasonic waves are generated due to thermoelastic expansion and, at higher laser <b>power</b> <b>densities,</b> ablation of the material. These sound generation mechanisms {{have been the subject}} of numerous theoretical [1 - 3] and experimental [4 - 6] studies and are now fairly well understood; several reviews have also been published [7 - 9]. In particular, it has been established that at low <b>power</b> <b>densities</b> the thermoelastic mechanism is well described by a surface center of expansion [1]. This mechanism produces a characteristic waveform whose amplitude is proportional to the energy absorbed from the laser pulse and also dependent on the thermal and elastic properties of the material [1 - 2]. At higher <b>power</b> <b>densities</b> the melting point of the material is reached, and eventually vaporization of the material takes place [5]. Rapid vaporization leads to ablation of material. Significant ablation occurs only during the laser pulse at <b>power</b> <b>densities</b> near the ablation onset threshold, creating an ultrasonic excitation source with the same time dependence as the laser pulse. At higher laser <b>power</b> <b>densities</b> the ablation process continues after the laser pulse and eventually the ultrasonic source changes from pulse to step like in time dependence [5, 9]. In this region plasma absorption also plays a significant role...|$|R

40|$|Studies of {{materials}} under extreme conditions have relevance {{to a broad}} area of research, including planetary physics, fusion research, materials science, and structural biology with x-ray lasers. We study such extreme conditions and experimentally probe the interaction between ultrashort soft x-ray pulses and solid targets (metals and their deuterides) at the FLASH free-electron laser where <b>power</b> <b>densities</b> exceeding 10 (17) W/cm(2) were reached. Time-of-flight ion spectrometry and crater analysis were used to characterize the interaction. The results show the onset of saturation in the ablation process at <b>power</b> <b>densities</b> above 10 (16) W/cm(2).
