25|$|On May 15, 1754, {{at about}} 9 or 10 {{o'clock in the}} night, the volcano quite {{unexpectedly}} commenced to roar and emit, sky-high, burning flames intermixed with glowing rocks which, falling back upon the island and rolling down {{the slopes of the}} mountain, created the impression of a large river of fire. During the following days there appeared in the lake a large quantity of <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> which had been ejected by the volcano. Part of these ejecta had also reached the hamlet of Bayuyungan and completely destroyed it.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} quarter of the eighteenth century, it became fashionable to view art {{galleries}} at night by torchlight. Canova was an artist that leapt on the fad and displayed his works of art in his studio by candlelight. As such, Canova would begin to finalize the statue with special tools by candlelight, to soften the transitions between the various parts of the nude. After a little recarving, he began to rub the statue down with <b>pumice</b> <b>stone,</b> sometimes for period longer that weeks or months. If that was not enough, he would use tripoli (rottenstone) and lead.|$|E
25|$|All equines have a {{parasite}} burden, and therefore treatment is periodically needed throughout life. Some steps to reduce parasite infection include regularly removing droppings from the animal's stall, shed or field; breaking up droppings in fields by harrowing or disking; minimizing crowding in fields; periodically leaving a field empty for several weeks; or placing animals other than equines {{on the field}} {{for a period of}} time, particularly ruminants, which do not host the same species of parasites as equines. If botflies are active, frequent application of fly spray may repel insects. A small <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> or specialized bot egg knife can also scrape off any bot eggs that were laid on the hairs of the horse.|$|E
30|$|Bio-effectors {{included}} BE 1 and BE 2, each placed as {{a band of}} BE-treated <b>pumice</b> <b>stones</b> (Table  1). To treat <b>pumice</b> <b>stones</b> (Rotocell 0.3 – 1.5, density 320  kg m− 3, ROTEC GmbH & Co. KG, Mülheim-Kärlich, Germany) with BE, Cl-free water suspensions of Proradix (6.6  ×  1010  CFUs g− 1) and RhizoVital FZB 42 (2.5  ×  1010  spores g− 1) {{were each}} prepared to a concentration of 2  ×  1012 CFUs l− 1 or spores l− 1. Each suspension was evenly applied using a pressurized hand pump sprayer {{at the rate of}} 0.23  l kg− 1 <b>pumice</b> <b>stones,</b> which were spread on a plastic sheet (0.47  ×  1012  CFUs or spores kg− 1 <b>pumice</b> <b>stones).</b> <b>Pumice</b> <b>stones</b> were then turned over several times to homogenize inoculum absorption, air-dried at room temperature and applied on the field on the same day. Application was done by placement in 5 – 10  cm deep furrows cut in the sowing row. The application rate was 32  g <b>pumice</b> <b>stones</b> m− 1 furrow (100  ml <b>pumice</b> <b>stones</b> m− 1 furrow). Furrows were covered with soil and the entire plot was tilled with a rototiller to 10  cm depth. The final inoculum density in soil within the sowing row was 1  ×  109  CFU kg− 1 soil DM (15  kg soil DM m− 1 furrow; 10  cm row width; and 10  cm row depth, soil bulk density 1.5  g cm− 3), which was about ten times higher the inoculum density (10  cm depth) if the inoculum was evenly applied over the entire plot area (0.13  ×  109  CFU kg− 1).|$|R

In the evening they encamped on a branch of Big River.|$|R
25|$|Alumina-catalyzed {{cracking}} {{systems are}} still in use {{in high school and}} university laboratories in experiments concerning alkanes and alkenes. The catalyst is usually obtained by crushing <b>pumice</b> <b>stones,</b> which contain mainly aluminium oxide and silica into small, porous pieces. In the laboratory, aluminium oxide (or porous pot) must be heated.|$|R
2500|$|Other {{materials}} used for masks include wax, fired clay, leather, cloth, wire mesh, sheet metal, rubber tires, cardboard and paper mache. Masks of wax {{are made in}} the Mexico City area, which perfectly fit the wearers face for a very realistic appearance. Other areas to use wax in this way include Villa de Zaachila, San Bartolo Coyotepec and Zapotec communities near the city of Oaxaca [...] These masks are made by molding the wax to the wearer’s own face. Tools used by wood mask makers include machetes, knives and blades, often fashioned by the craftsman himself. Other tools can include chisels, pliers and more with sandpaper or <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> for smoothing. Sometimes the masks are covered in plaster to achieve a smooth finish. Lacquer is used on masks in locations in Michoacán and Guerrero, where the technique is applied to a number of other items as well.|$|E
60|$|On, on, we rode, in {{fear and}} trembling. The volcano now was all in full blast. Ashes and <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> kept falling around us. Smoke and steam {{obscured}} our way. But the dangers of nature frightened us little in comparison; what we dreaded most was the desperate onslaught of the enraged Hawaiians.|$|E
60|$|Their {{friend the}} Colonel {{personally}} accompanied {{them to the}} towns that had suffered the most from the eruption. At Boscatrecasa they walked over the great beds of lava that had demolished the town--banks of cinders looking like lumps of <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> and massed from twenty to thirty feet in thickness throughout the valley. The lava was still so hot that it was liable to blister the soles of their feet unless they kept constantly moving. It would be many more days before {{the interior of the}} mass became cold.|$|E
5000|$|Ellis Beach is {{also home}} to the Ellis Beach Surf Lifesaving Club which {{regularly}} hosts competitions and events. From November to May, a stinger net patrolled by the club helps protect swimmers from marine [...] "stingers" [...] (jellyfish species of Chironex and Irukandji) which inhabit the waters during those months. Ellis Beach features <b>pumice</b> <b>stones</b> along its beautiful shores.|$|R
50|$|Besides the {{artifacts}} mentioned above, mortars, spindle whorls, pestles and polished <b>pumice</b> <b>stones</b> were unearthed. In addition, Chinese beads from a bracelet, {{associated with a}} bangle and a brown stoneware jarlet, were also obtained. Nuts, plant remains and wood fragments were also obtained through wet flotation method. Animal bones and teeth were also present. Lastly, features such as postholes, hearths, middens and plough marks were recorded.|$|R
50|$|Wonga Beach is a beachside town {{situated}} {{between the}} small residential towns of Rocky Point (sometimes {{referred to as}} Dayman Point) and the Daintree township. It is approximately 17 km north {{of the town of}} Mossman. In 1985 a large volcanic eruption beneath the Coral Sea released thousands of <b>Pumice</b> <b>stones</b> to the ocean surface which were then blown along north Queensland's shore by the trade winds.|$|R
60|$|Day had by {{this time}} broken, and a stir and bustle {{commenced}} {{in front of the}} long line of casemates; the elephants were brought out from their stables and stood rocking themselves from side to side while their keepers rubbed their hides with <b>pumice</b> <b>stone.</b> Nessus {{was one of those who}} was appointed to make the great flat cakes of coarse flour which formed the principal food of the elephants. The other Arabs busied themselves in bringing in fresh straw, which Malchus scattered evenly over the stall; heaps of freshly cut forage were placed before each elephant.|$|E
60|$|A {{gigantic}} eruption, {{like that}} of Krakatoa a few years ago, with the accompanying earthquakes, tidal waves, and clouds of volcanic dust, changes {{the face of the}} surrounding landscape beyond recognition, bringing down the high lands, elevating the low, making fair lakes where deserts had been, and deserts where green prairies had smiled before. The tremendous catastrophe which had befallen Tom had changed his moral landscape in much the same way. Some of his low places he found lifted to ideals, some of his ideas had sunk to the valleys, and lay there with the sackcloth and ashes of <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> and sulphur on their ruined heads.|$|E
60|$|Isabella, {{the second}} daughter, was, par excellence, a beauty--a tall, sparkling, Cleopatra-looking girl, whose rich color, {{dazzling}} eyes, and superb figure might have bid defiance to art to furnish an extra charm; nevertheless, each grace {{had been as}} indefatigably drilled and manoeuvred as the members of an artillery company. Eyes, lips, eyelashes, all had their lesson; and every motion of her sculptured limbs, every intonation of her silvery voice, had been studied, considered, and corrected, till even her fastidious mother could discern nothing that was wanting. Then were added all the graces of belles lettres--all the approved rules of being delighted with music, painting, and poetry--and last of all came the tour of the continent; travelling being generally considered a sort of <b>pumice</b> <b>stone,</b> for rubbing down the varnish, and giving the very last touch to character.|$|E
50|$|In 62 A.D., an {{earthquake}} shook {{the city of}} Pompeii, destroying much of the Temple of Jupiter. After this, the much smaller Temple of Jupiter Meilichios became the main seat of worship to Jupiter and the Capitoline Triad. The original Temple of Jupiter was still awaiting restoration when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79, burying the town of Pompeii in volcanic dust, ash, and <b>pumice</b> <b>stones.</b> The excavated temple can still be seen in Pompeii today.|$|R
25|$|The great earthquake, whose {{epicentre}} {{was estimated}} at some kilometres north-northwest of the town, {{in the area of}} Monte Escuro, culminated in a scale X event, resulting in landslides throughout the island, likely influenced by a saturated sub-soil from torrential rainfalls several days earlier. The island's volcanic terrain, consisting of low-density pyroclastic materials, such as the <b>pumice</b> <b>stones</b> that comprise the flanks of the Água do Pau Massif, as susceptible to landslides resulting in the creation of lahars.

50|$|On 20 November 2007, {{the first}} set of photos were {{released}} showing the vault of the cave which is encrusted with colourful mosaics, <b>pumice</b> <b>stones</b> and seashells. The center of the ceiling features a depiction of a white eagle, the symbol of the Roman Empire during the reign of Augustus, the first Roman emperor. Archaeologists are still searching for the entrance of the grotto.Its location below Augustus' residence is thought to be significant; Octavian, before he became Augustus, had considered taking the name Romulus to indicate that he intended to found Rome anew.|$|R

And so, when Arbaces, {{who was one of}} the generals under him, a Mede by birth, endeavoured to manage by the {{assistance}} of one of the eunuchs, whose name was Sparamizus, to see Sardanapalus: and when ... he saw him painted with vermilion, and adorned like a woman, sitting among his concubines, carding purple wool, and sitting among them with his feet up, wearing a woman's robe, and with his beard carefully scraped, and his face smoothed with <b>pumice</b> <b>stone</b> (for he was whiter than milk, and pencilled under his eyes and eyebrows; and when he saw Arbaces he was putting a little more white under his eyes). Most historians, of whom Duris is one, relate that Arbaces, being indignant at his countrymen being ruled over by such a monarch as that, stabbed him and slew him. But Ctesias says that he went to war with him, and collected a great army, and then that Sardanapalus, being dethroned by Arbaces, died, burning himself alive in his palace, having heaped up a funeral pile four plethra in extent, on which he placed 150 golden couches."--The Deipnosophistæ ... of Athenæus, bk. xii. c. 38, translated by C.

40|$|The {{ability of}} Aspergillus japonicus ATCC 20236 to colonize {{different}} synthetic materials (polyurethane foam, stainless steel sponge, vegetal fiber, <b>pumice</b> <b>stones,</b> zeolites, and foam glass) and to produce fructooligosaccharides (FOS) from sucrose (165 g/L) is described. Cells were immobilized in situ by absorption, through {{direct contact with}} the carrier particles at the beginning of fermentation. Vegetal fiber was the best immobilization carrier as A. japonicus grew well on it (1. 25 g/g carrier), producing 116. 3 g/L FOS (56. 3 g/L 1 -kestose, 46. 9 g/L 1 -nystose, and 13. 1 g/L 1 -β-fructofuranosyl nystose) with 69 % yield (78 % based only in the consumed sucrose amount), giving also elevated activity of the β-fructofuranosidase enzyme (42. 9 U/mL). In addition, no loss of material integrity, over a 2 day-period, was found. The fungus also immobilized well on stainless steel sponge (1. 13 g/g carrier), but in lesser extents on polyurethane foam, zeolites, and <b>pumice</b> <b>stones</b> (0. 48, 0. 19, and 0. 13 g/g carrier, respectively), while on foam glass no cell adhesion was observed. When compared with the FOS and β-fructofuranosidase production by free A. japonicus, the results achieved using cells immobilized on vegetal fiber were closely similar. It was thus concluded that A. japonicus immobilized on vegetal fiber is a potential alternative for high production of FOS at industrial scale. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|R

60|$|At daybreak {{they were}} up and on the march, {{scrambling}} up the mountain side for the distance of eight painful miles. From the casual hints given in the travelling memoranda of Mr. Stuart, this mountain would seem to offer a rich field of speculation for the geologist. Here was a plain three miles in diameter, strewed with <b>pumice</b> <b>stones</b> and other volcanic reliques, with a lake in the centre, occupying what had probably been the crater. Here were also, in some places, deposits of marine shells, indicating that this mountain crest had at some remote period been below the waves.|$|R
