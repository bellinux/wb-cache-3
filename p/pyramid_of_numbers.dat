30|$|The idea of {{the impact}} of distortions on NSS has been used in[104] for {{prediction}} of video quality where each frame of the video is decomposed into a Laplacian <b>pyramid</b> <b>of</b> a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> subbands. Intra-subband statistics including mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, energy, entropy, and inter-subband statistics, namely, Jensen Shannon divergence, SSIM, and smoothness are computed. A Minkowski pooling scheme is adopted to yield a single value out of the aforementioned statistics. The proposed method is reported to perform better than some FR metrics while tested on the LIVE video quality database.|$|R

The trophic pyramid roughly represents the biomass (usually measured as total dry-weight) at each level. Plants generally have the greatest biomass. Names of trophic categories are shown {{to the right of}} the pyramid. Some ecosystems, such as many wetlands, do not organize as a strict pyramid, because aquatic plants are not as productive as long-lived terrestrial plants such as trees. Ecological trophic pyramids are typically one of three kinds: 1) <b>pyramid</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbers,</b> 2) pyramid of biomass, or 3) pyramid of energy.|$|E
40|$|A {{multichannel}} texture segmentation {{algorithm is}} presented {{based on the}} image pyramids produced with the Bamberger directional filter bank. An extensive evaluation <b>of</b> Bamberger <b>pyramids</b> and their design parameters is presented. The impact on segmentation performance of factors like the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pyramid</b> levels, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> directional channels, redundancy and filter specifications is considered. The proposed system is shown to provide {{some of the best}} results reported to date when compared with other multichannel representations under similar evaluation conditions. It is further shown that segmentation results using the maximally decimated directional filter bank rival those of the undecimated case. To the knowledge of the authors, such performance has not been previously observed for decompositions with decimated channels...|$|R

50|$|In 1927, Elton {{published}} his now classic book Animal Ecology. This book outlines the important principles of ecological studies of animal behaviour and life history, {{such as food}} chains, the size of food items, the ecological niche {{and the concept of}} a <b>pyramid</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbers</b> as a method of representing the structure of an ecosystem in terms of feeding relationships.In later works on the niche theory, Elton's definition - the Eltonian niche - in terms of functional attributes of organisms (or its position in the trophic web), has been viewed by some authors as opposed to Joseph Grinnell's earlier definition emphasising states of the environment suitable for the species. However, others have argued that there are more similarities than dissimilarities between the two versions of the niche concept.|$|E
40|$|Teacher {{assessment}} of pupils’ on-going classroom science {{work can be}} a more valid means of judging their attainment than testing, {{because it can be}} based on a wider range of evidence; for example, observations, discussions and pupil presentations. However, questions remain regarding the reliability of teacher assessment, as they find such summative judgements difficult to make and have limited opportunities for moderation. This is of particular concern in England, where {{assessment of}} the new National Curriculum in science is entirely dependent on teacher assessment at primary level. The Teacher Assessment in Primary Science (TAPS) project aims to develop the quality and reliability of teachers’ judgements and establish a set of principles for effective assessment against which schools can evaluate their practice. It is driven by the following questions: ** What approaches are primary teachers in England currently using to assess children’s learning in science? **How valid, reliable and manageable are these approaches? **Can an approach be synthesised from elements of existing practice which embodies core principles of effective assessment? Data collected from 12 schools have included samples of assessment materials, interviews with key staff and observations of teachers making assessments during science lessons, together with school self-analyses against a theoretical framework developed from the work of Nuffield Foundation (2012), which uses the analogy of an ecosystem <b>pyramid</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbers</b> to represent the flow of assessment information between formative and summative purposes. Each participating teacher has also developed and piloted classroom assessment tasks, the resulting pupil work from which has been moderated between schools. Qualitative analysis of the above data sources has fed into case studies representing a typology of approaches examined against the principles of assessment embodied in the self-evaluation framework. We discuss the impact of piloting tasks on participants’ practice in recognising and making use of classroom assessment opportunities...|$|E
40|$|A scrics of 24 samples {{was taken}} at {{periodic}} intervals {{at a single}} locality in Buzzards Bay from February 1958 to January 1958. With the exception of 4 samples which dc-parted markedly from the others in regard to sediment composition, very high indices of faunal affinity were ohtaincd within the scrics. The silt-clay fraction of the scdimcnt in the 20 snmplcs with high faunal indices varied from 78 - 91 (r, and when the contained species were ranked by abundance, the commoner species achicvcd approximately the same rank from sample to sample. Thus, 8 or 9 species arc a constant part of the biological environ-ment of this association, {{and there is an}} approximately constant numerical proportionality among them. Seventy-nine spccics were ohtaincd from the 20 samples of typical sedi-mcnr composition, I-Iowevcr, 11 spccics comprised almost 95 % of the total fauna by numhcr while the lamellibranch Nucula proxima (58. 86 %) and the polychacte Nep!&ays inciscc (17. 21 %) were commonest. Ten species make up 95 % of the total biomass. Thus the community, both numerically and by biomass, is charactcrizcd by pronounced dominance of few spccics. The niches of the 9 most common species, representing 93. 5 % of the community by number, were categorized by method of feeding, kind of food and spatial distribution. Considering only thcsc few factors, it was possible to demonstrate certain differences in niche prcfcrence. The relationship of animal numbers to animal weight rcvcaled the cxpccted <b>pyramid</b> <b>of</b> <b>numbers</b> with very few organisms in the largest weight categories and numerous individuals in the smaller weight groups. However, when the biomass within each weight category was determined, the cxpccted inverted pyramid did not result. Numbers arc considered more valid than biomass in quantitative benthic studies, since only 0. 15 % of the fauna constitute 55. 17 % of the entire weight. The presence or absenec of a rare, randomly distributed large animal may alter the biomass of an individual sample by two orders ol magnitude...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} use <b>of</b> <b>pyramid</b> coding in various digital image and video compression applications, the progressive transmission of images, and the efficient ecovery of motion information from video sequences. Through the use <b>of</b> feedback, <b>pyramid</b> coding allows both flexibility in th choice of filters, {{and the use}} of quantization noise feedback. While the filters {{have a significant effect on}} the properties <b>of</b> the generated <b>pyramid,</b> quantization feedbackallows more control over the distortion introduced indirectly into the reconstructed image through separate quantization <b>of</b> the <b>pyramid</b> subimages. After a frequency domain analysis <b>of</b> <b>pyramid</b> coding, a new class of decimation and interpolation filters is developed. The use of both different filters, and quantization feedback in various applications is then explored. This is followed by proposals regarding possible choices of generation schemes and filters for the efficient implementation <b>of</b> <b>pyramid</b> coding in these applications. Finally, the performance <b>of</b> the <b>pyramid</b> codec is evaluated against both optimal methods, where appropriate, and other proposed suboptimal methods. For example, a filter pair is proposed for lossless image coding that not only leads to the generation <b>of</b> low entropy <b>pyramids,</b> but also allows a given image to be represented as a subsampled <b>pyramid</b> <b>of</b> the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> pixels. Lossless compression ratios significantly higher than in the case of related techniques are achieved by this form <b>of</b> <b>pyramid</b> coding, while generally at a fraction of the computational cost.
