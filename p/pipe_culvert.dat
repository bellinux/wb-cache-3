40|$|A {{deteriorated}} concrete {{box culvert}} conveying {{a tributary of}} the Saugeen River under Highway 21 in Ontario had reached the end of its lifespan and was in need of replacement. The tributary supports a diverse range of coldwater fish species such as Rainbow Trout; however, fish passage, particularly upstream migration, has been cut off since the culvert and highway were constructed over seventy-five years ago. Specifically, fish passage has been hindered by shallow sheet flow along the sixty metre flat bottom, excessive velocities associated with the smooth, seven percent gradient, and a perched barrier at the downstream outlet. A key component of the culvert replacement was an effort to improve the overall condition of the tributary’s natural environment, including the promotion of fish passage and migration opportunities. The culvert replacement project undertaken by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) and MMM Group, coupled resources with the Saugeen Ojibway Nation (SON) Environment office, Parsons biologists, and Aquafor geomorphologists. The most ecologically sensitive replacement methodology of an open bottom structure was not viable for this project as it would have required a full closure of the Highway for approximately four months.

Spoiler baffles (100 x 70 x 28 or 56 mm) were installed in three spatial arrangements along a 5. 5 -m section of the pipe, and individual fish passage assessed at three flow velocities (0. 35, 0. 70 and 1. 0 m s 1). Common jollytails (43 - 169 mm fork length, FL) were 10 times more successful in passing when baffles were present than under control conditions (baffles absent). Baffle size did not influence success, which increased with the spatial complexity of the baffle arrangement. Across all velocities, common jollytails (46 - 132 mm FL) and spotted galaxias (55 - 190 mm FL) were, respectively, 86 and 73 times more successful with the most complex baffle arrangement (overall 80 % success) compared with control conditions (overall 13. 5 % success).

Culvert-related effects on instream habitat and fish assemblages were measured at 10 stream sites: five sites contained culverts with artificial bottom substrates and five sites contained culverts with natural bottom substrates. On each stream, paired sampling reaches (reach length 35 times mean reach width, drainage area 3 ̆c 11 km 2) were established 50 m upstream and 50 m downstream of the culvert. Reaches downstream of culverts with artificial substrates (compared to upstream reaches; related-samples t test) exhibited greater water depths, lower gravel/sediment depths, and higher percentages of bedrock and boulder substrates (P 3 ̆c 0. 10). Reaches downstream of natural substrate culverts (compared to upstream reaches) exhibited faster current velocities (P 3 ̆c 0. 10).

40|$|While it {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that culverted road-stream crossings may impede fish passage, effects of culverts on movement of nongame and small-bodied fishes have not been extensively studied and studies generally have not accounted for spatial variation in capture probabilities. We estimated probabilities for upstream and downstream movement of small (30 - 120 mm standard length) benthic and water column fishes across stream reaches with and without culverts at four road-stream crossings over a 4 - 6 -week period. Movement and reach-specific capture probabilities were estimated using multistate capture-recapture models. Although none of the culverts were complete barriers to passage, only a bottomless-box culvert appeared to permit unrestricted upstream and downstream movements by benthic fishes based on model estimates of movement probabilities. At two box culverts that were perched above the water surface at base flow, observed movements were limited to water column fishes and to intervals when runoff from storm events raised water levels above the perched level. Only a single fish was observed to move through a partially embedded <b>pipe</b> <b>culvert.</b> Estimates for probabilities of movement over distances equal to at least the length of one culvert were low (e. g., generally ≤ 0. 03, estimated for 1 - 2 -week intervals) and had wide 95 % confidence intervals {{as a consequence of}} few observed movements to nonadjacent reaches. Estimates of capture probabilities varied among reaches by a factor of 2 to over 10, illustrating the importance of accounting for spatially variable capture rates when estimating movement probabilities with capture-recapture data.

Wildlife passages (n= 17) were monitored year round from 2012 to 2015. Two research questions were addressed: (1) Does discovery and use differ between passages and if so, why? and (2) Are there differences between species? Global and species-specific models were produced for both discovery and use. A linear mixed-effects model was used for discoveries (log-transformed counts) and a generalized linear mixed model was used for usage (binary response). Species’ responded to the passages differently, with discoveries increasing overall and in particular for marmots (Marmota monax) as latitude increased. <b>Pipe</b> <b>culverts</b> {{were more likely to}} be discovered by micromammals and wooden ledge culverts by red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) than other passage types.
