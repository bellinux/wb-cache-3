As of late 2012, global revenues for investment banks were estimated at $240 billion, down about a third from 2009, as companies pursued less deals and traded less.

The rule seeks to ensure that banking organizations are both well capitalized and well managed. The proposed draft form of the Volcker Rule was presented by regulators for public comment on October 11, 2011, with the rule due to go into effect on July 21, 2012.|$|E

2500|$|The U.S.'s Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act {{was passed}} in July 2010 and {{requires}} SEC registration of advisers who manage private funds with more than US$150 million in assets. Registered managers must file Form ADV with the SEC, {{as well as information}} regarding their assets under management and trading positions. [...] Previously, advisers with fewer than 15 clients were exempt, although many hedge fund advisers voluntarily registered with the SEC to satisfy institutional investors. Under Dodd-Frank, investment advisers with less than US$100 million in assets under management became subject to state regulation. This increased the number of hedge funds under state supervision. Overseas advisers who managed more than US$25 million were also required to register with the SEC. The Act requires hedge funds to provide information about their trades and portfolios to regulators including the newly created Financial Stability Oversight Council. In this regard, most hedge funds and other private funds, including private equity funds, must file Form PF with the SEC, which is an extensive reporting form with substantial data on the funds' activities and positions.

Research also covers credit research, fixed income research, macroeconomic research, and quantitative analysis, all of which are used internally and externally to advise clients but do not directly affect revenue. All research groups, nonetheless, provide a key service in terms of advisory and strategy. There is a potential conflict of interest between the investment bank and its analysis, in that published analysis can impact the performance of a security (in the secondary markets or an initial public offering) or influence the relationship between the banker and its corporate clients, thereby affecting the bank's profitability [...]|$|E

2500|$|Title VI, or the [...] "Bank and Savings Association Holding Company and Depository Institution Regulatory Improvements Act of 2010", {{introduces}} the so-called [...] "Volcker Rule" [...] after former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker by amending the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. With {{the aim of}} {{reducing the amount of}} speculative investments on large firms' balance sheets, it limits banking entities to owning no more in a hedge fund or private equity fund than 3% of the total ownership interest. The total of all of the banking entity's interests in hedge funds or private equity funds cannot exceed 3% of the Tier 1 capital of the banking entity. Furthermore, no bank that has a direct or indirect relationship with a hedge fund or private equity fund, [...] "may enter into a transaction with the fund, or with any other hedge fund or private equity fund that is controlled by such fund" [...] without disclosing {{the full extent of the}} relationship to the regulating entity, and assuring that there is no conflict of interest. [...] "Banking entity" [...] includes an insured depository institution, any company controlling an insured depository institution and such a company's affiliates and subsidiaries, and must comply with the Act within two years of its passing, although it may apply for time extensions.

2500|$|On {{behalf of}} the bank and its clients, a large {{investment}} bank's primary function is [...] buying and selling products. In market making, traders will buy and sell financial products {{with the goal of}} making money on each trade. Sales is the term for the investment bank's sales force, whose primary job is to call on institutional and high-net-worth investors to suggest trading ideas (on a caveat emptor basis) and take orders. Sales desks then communicate their clients' orders to the appropriate trading rooms, which can price and execute trades, or structure new products that fit a specific need. Structuring has been a relatively recent activity as derivatives have come into play, with highly technical and numerate employees working on creating complex structured products which typically offer much greater margins and returns than underlying cash securities. In 2010, investment banks came under pressure as a result of selling complex derivatives contracts to local municipalities in Europe and the US. Strategists advise external as well as internal clients on the strategies that can be adopted in various markets. Ranging from derivatives to specific industries, strategists place companies and industries in a quantitative framework with full consideration of the macroeconomic scene. This strategy often affects the way the firm will operate in the market, the direction it would like to take in terms of its proprietary and flow positions, the suggestions salespersons give to clients, as well as the way structurers create new products. Banks also undertake risk through <b>proprietary</b> <b>trading,</b> performed by a special set of traders who do not interface with clients and through [...] "principal risk"—risk undertaken by a trader after he buys or sells a product to a client and does not hedge his total exposure.
