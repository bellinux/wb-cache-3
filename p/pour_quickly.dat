50|$|Thimble {{measures}} are popular for home use, as they allow a relatively untrained person to <b>pour</b> <b>quickly</b> and accurately from several bottles without risking cross-contamination between them, or requiring the purchase, use and cleaning of a pour spout for each bottle {{as would be}} seen in a professional bar.|$|E
50|$|Wheat beers tend to foam a lot, {{especially}} if <b>poured</b> <b>quickly.</b> In pubs, if the bottle is handed to the patron for self pouring, it is customary for {{the glass to}} be taken to the patron wet or with a bit of water in the bottom to be swirled around to wet the entire glass to keep the beer from foaming excessively.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, a {{temporary}} heliport {{was added to}} the Mansion so that President Lyndon B. Johnson would have a place to land the President's helicopter. A concrete slab was <b>poured</b> <b>quickly</b> for the president's visit. Once President Johnson left, the slab was converted to a private tennis court. During the following decade, Oklahomans raised money for a private swimming pool in the shape of Oklahoma.|$|R
60|$|Fortifying {{himself with}} this assurance, Sikes drained {{the glass to}} the bottom, and then, with many grumbling oaths, called for his physic. The girl jumped up, with great alacrity; <b>poured</b> it <b>quickly</b> out, but with her back towards him; and held the vessel to his lips, while he drank off the contents.|$|R
50|$|Following that, {{she left}} {{in hope of}} searching for a way home. After having wandered through {{a large part of}} Hell, she finally finds a crack through which {{moonlight}} <b>pours</b> through. <b>Quickly</b> she passes through the crack, only to be greeted by Doctor Doom on the other side, within Dracula's ship departing from the moon.|$|R
5|$|Jimmy Carter {{would later}} {{refer to the}} line in his presidential {{nomination}} speech at the 1976 Democratic National Convention, though it addresses matters of the self which supersede politics, in the process displaying certain themes associated with existentialism. Throughout the song, the words <b>pour</b> out <b>quickly,</b> with Dylan barely taking a breath between lines, so that the intricate rhyming structure is often missed: AAAAAB CCCCCB DDDDDB in the verses and AAB in the chorus.|$|R
30|$|The {{following}} steps {{were performed to}} prepare the column. In this step, a clean column (1.5 × 50 cm) with a glass wool at the bottom was used. It is notable that the applied glass container and column have to be washed with soapy water, rinsed with distilled water and {{a small amount of}} acetone, and ultimately dried in an oven. A small amount (0.5 cm) of dry sand was added to the column on top of the glass wool. The column was filled with the stationary phase including different percentages of silica gel, AC, and celite. Hexan was added to the beaker containing stationary phase as a solvent. The contents of the beaker were stirred to remove air bubbles, and solid particles were allowed to get wet. A funnel was placed on top of the column, and the stationary phase was <b>poured</b> <b>quickly</b> into the column. If necessary, the columns' stopcock will be opened, and some of the hexane was drained away to the stationary phase. This process was repeated until most of the stationary phase transferred to the column. The column was then gently tapped in order to remove the bubbles and compress the stationary phase; 1 cm of sand was smoothly added {{to the top of the}} stationary phase. The stopcock was opened, and the excess hexane was drained until its level reaches above the sand level.|$|R
50|$|Air- and water-free {{solvents}} {{are also}} necessary. If high-purity solvents {{are available in}} nitrogen-purged Winchesters, they can be brought directly into the glovebox. For use with Schlenk technique, they can be <b>quickly</b> <b>poured</b> into Schlenk flasks charged with molecular sieves, and degassed. More typically, solvent is dispensed directly from a still or solvent purification column.|$|R
5000|$|At its simplest, cà phê đá is {{made using}} medium to coarse ground dark roast Vietnamese-grown coffee {{with a small}} metal Vietnamese drip filter (phin cà phê). After the hot water is added, the drip filter {{releases}} drops of hot coffee slowly into a cup. This finished cup of hot coffee is then <b>quickly</b> <b>poured</b> into a glass full of ice making the finished Vietnamese iced coffee.|$|R
50|$|The {{liquid sugar}} is blended {{with a small}} amount of royal icing. The heat from the sugar causes the air {{incorporated}} in the icing to rapidly expand, causing the mixture to grow to several times its original volume. The mixture is <b>quickly</b> <b>poured</b> into a lined dish, and placed into a blast chiller to set. This process produces a sugar mass with the texture of volcanic pumice, the color of which is determined by the color of the sugar syrup.|$|R
50|$|The BRM {{crew were}} nervously pacing {{up and down}} in the pits, hoping the thirsty engine could go the {{distance}} without stopping. At the end of his 100th lap, however, Rodríguez coasted into the pit lane with a dry tank. BRM <b>quickly</b> <b>poured</b> in a few gallons of fuel, as Fittipaldi crossed the line, leading the richest race of the year. Rodríguez rejoined ahead of the second Lotus of Wisell, but he had lost 38 seconds to Fittipaldi and could do nothing about the Brazilian's lead.|$|R
50|$|One social {{issue which}} {{was too hot}} for The Young and the Restless {{audience}} of the mid-'70s was homosexuality. In the mid-1970s, Kay befriended an overweight, unhappy housewife named Joann Curtis. Kay moved Joann into her home and helped her get a better self-image. Soon, Kay's son Brock wondered about all the time the ladies were spending together, as Kay planned a special vacation to Hawaii for herself and Joann. The ratings dropped and outraged fan letters <b>poured</b> in. Bell <b>quickly</b> dropped the relationship, wrote out Joann, and the show stabilized.|$|R
5000|$|The {{relatively}} high viscosity and thixotropic nature of ketchup can make pouring {{it from a}} glass bottle somewhat difficult and unpredictable, and several urban legends surrounding this phenomenon have arisen. According to one popular folk remedy, repeatedly hitting the [...] "57" [...] mark on a glass Heinz ketchup bottle makes the ketchup <b>pour</b> out more <b>quickly</b> and easily. The New York Times suggests {{this is a matter}} of intentional design, with Heinz having placed the [...] "57" [...] mark on that particular spot of the bottle as a target for consumers to hit. According to the Heinz website, only 11% of people know this trick.|$|R
50|$|First, cut a {{piece of}} old ginger into small pieces and grind the ginger to fine. Then, squeeze the juice out by {{pressing}} the ginger through a sieve. Put the juice into a bowl. Next, bring the milk {{to a boil and}} dissolve sugar in milk. Take off heat and allow it to cool a little. If you have a kitchen thermometer, place your kitchen thermometer into the milk. The optimum curdling temperature is 70 C. In the mean time, stir the ginger juice thoroughly. When milk temperature decreases to around 75-70°C, <b>pour</b> the milk <b>quickly</b> {{into the middle of the}} ginger juice. Wait for two to three minutes. The milk will then be curdled, and may be eaten with a spoon.|$|R
50|$|A Coeurl, a large, intelligent, black cat-like animal, {{considers}} its near-future starvation as {{its food}} source of id-creatures has been hunted to extinction. Just as all seems lost, a spaceship lands near an abandoned Coeurl city and id-creatures <b>pour</b> out. He <b>quickly</b> surmises {{they are a}} scientific expedition from another star, which excites him as he considers scientists to be unlikely to harm him. He approaches them as if simply curious. The human expedition is first concerned about the Coeurl's approach, but he shows himself to be intelligent and attempting to communicate via radio waves. Assuming an intelligent species would be as curious about them as they are about him, they show him their ship. The Coeurl begins to plan to kill all of the men onboard and then fly to wherever they came from so he will have unlimited id.|$|R
5000|$|But when, in 1168, rich silver finds were {{discovered}} {{in the area of}} Freiberg, it precipitated the First Berggeschrey. Upon hearing the news of rich silver deposits miners, traders, charcoal burners and vagabonds <b>quickly</b> <b>poured</b> into this, at that time, inhospitable area. [...] "Where a man wants to look for ore, he is allowed to do so with rights" [...] the Margrave of Meissen, owner of the rights to use the mountain (mining rights), had asserted to the settlers flooding into the area. In order to settle the miners, who mostly came from the Harz Mountains, they were exempt from the feudal obligations to their landlords and so were able to devote themselves entirely to their work. However they had to pay a direct tax {{in the form of a}} mining tithe (Bergzehnt) to their local lords.|$|R
30|$|ZIF- 8 was {{synthesized}} {{according to}} method {{reported in the}} literature [32]. Specifically, a methanolic solution (400  mL) of 2 -methylimidazole (6.48  g) and 1 -methylimidazole (6.28  mL) was <b>quickly</b> <b>poured</b> into a methanolic solution (400  mL) of Zn(NO 3) 2 · 6 H 2 O (5.88  g) and stirred for 2  min and then kept still for 16  h. After that, the solution was centrifuged, washed by methanol and dried at 60  °C for 3  h to produce a white solid (ZIF- 8). Then, the solid was ground into powder, followed by heat treatment at 800  °C for 5  h under an argon atmosphere. After letting it cooldown to the room temperature, the obtained product was dispersed into an HCl solution (100  mL, 20  wt% in water) and stirred for 24  h to remove residual metallic Zn and/or ZnO. The mixture was then washed thoroughly with distilled water several times until all the zinc ions were removed. Finally, the resultant product was dried at 60  °C in vacuum oven for 6  h to obtain an N-doped hierarchically porous carbon.|$|R
50|$|The freshly drawn {{blood is}} {{collected}} in a bowl, and prevented from premature coagulation (hãm huyết), by mixing it with some fish sauce of certain proportions, usually three to five soup spoons of fish sauce for one quart (approximately 1 liter) of blood. Finely chopped meat such as cooked duck innards (such as gizzards) and duck meat are put {{in a shallow dish}} along with a sprinkling of crushed peanuts and chopped herbs such as Vietnamese coriander, mint, etc. The blood and fish sauce mixture is then diluted with some watery broth left from cooking the meat and/or gizzards to promote blood coagulation, then <b>quickly</b> <b>poured</b> into the prepared meat dish. After the blood has set, the finished dish resembles a pizza. The finished dish can be kept cooled in the refrigerator, which allows the blood to maintain its coagulated state, when immediate consumption is not called for right away. If the dish is removed from the refrigerator and left to sit at room temperature for a while the blood will return to a liquid state.|$|R
2500|$|Seeger died at New York-Presbyterian Hospital on January 27, 2014, {{at the age}} of 94. Response and {{reaction}} to Seeger's death <b>quickly</b> <b>poured</b> in. President Barack Obama noted that Seeger had been called [...] "America's tuning fork" [...] and that he believed in [...] "the power of song" [...] to bring social change, [...] "Over the years, Pete used his voice and his hammer to strike blows for workers' rights and civil rights; world peace and environmental conservation, and he always invited us to sing along.

50|$|Bunny, {{an elderly}} female rabbit, lives {{alone in a}} small cabin in the forest. While baking a cake one night, she is {{continually}} bothered by a large moth that keeps flying around her kitchen. No matter what she does, she cannot {{get rid of the}} intruder; she is especially annoyed when it runs into a photograph, taken many years ago, of herself and her late husband on their wedding day. Eventually she knocks it into the cake batter, which she <b>quickly</b> <b>pours</b> into a pan and shoves into the oven. She then sets the kitchen timer and falls asleep, only to be awakened by loud rumblings and blue-white light coming from the oven, whose door soon falls open. Crawling inside, she finds herself confronted by the moth and begins to float through an otherworldly space toward the source of the light, with a pair of giant moth wings sprouting from her back to propel her as the insect leads her along. She is soon revealed to be among dozens of moths being drawn to the light. The film ends with a close-up of the wedding photo, which comes to life as the younger Bunny nestles her head contentedly on her husband's shoulder; the shadows and reflections of two moths play across the image as well.|$|R

Rubber factories are always located close to water and the plantation {{in order to avoid}} lost time, which can diminish the quality of the finished rubber product. After the latex has been gathered from the rubber trees, it is poured into huge ten to fifteen thousand-gallon vats at the plantation factory, where it is mixed with water and acid. Once it is mixed perfectly, it is <b>quickly</b> <b>poured</b> into smaller five hundred-gallon vats, which are shown in the photograph. Wet aluminum plates are plunged into the vats and the contents are left to settle. After the mixture coagulates (about ten hours later), the plates can be removed and the rubber coagulum unrolled in a continuous strip. Then it is compressed through a system of rollers and sliced into thin sheets of rubber. The sheets are placed on drying trolleys in large buildings, and wood-smoked for three to four days until completely dry.

40|$|This {{study was}} a {{preliminary}} investigation into children’s attention to pragmatic leads when assigning reference to null subjects in three different sub-types of control. The sentences included were object control (Ron persuaded Hermione ec to kick the ball), controlled verbal gerund subjects (ec <b>Pouring</b> the water <b>quickly</b> made Harry wet) and temporal adjunct control (Harry tapped Luna while ec feeding the owl). 76 British children, aged 6; 9 to 11; 8, divided into five year groups, undertook three picture-selection tasks. Constructions were presented with no pragmatic lead, with a weak pragmatic lead cueing a particular referent and with a strong pragmatic lead cueing a particular referent. Children across all year groups ignored both leads when assigning reference to the null subject in object control, consulted both strengths of lead when doing so for verbal gerund subjects and utilised the strong lead when making an interpretative choice in temporal adjunct control. Thus they demonstrated a selective use of the discourse when interpreting these three different sub-types of control. The results for temporal adjunct control are surprising and the implications they have for its classification are discussed. The data on verbal gerund subjects provide a first step towards an understanding of older children’s development of this far less studied example of control. In addition, {{the way in which}} children attended to the discourse for this construction brings data to bear on the unresolved theoretical debate over the correct characterisation of the ec in non-obligatory control...|$|R
6000|$|The bucket is tipped {{into the}} furnace with a thunderous roar and the slag below <b>pours</b> forth more <b>quickly.</b> [...] "An engine," [...] says Experience, reflectively, [...] "can run over herself so to say. After she's broken up she is made into {{sleepers}} for the line. You'll see how she's broken up later." [...] A few paces further on, semi-nude demons are capering over strips of glowing hot iron which {{are put into}} a mill as rails and emerge as thin, shapely tie-bars. The natives wear rough sandals and some pretence of aprons, but {{the greater part of}} them is [...] "all face." [...] "As I said before," [...] says Experience, [...] "a native's cuteness when he's working on ticket is something startling. Beyond occasionally hanging on to a red-hot bar too long and so letting their pincers be drawn through the mills, these men take precious good care not to go wrong. Our machinery is fenced and guard-railed as much as possible, and these men don't get caught up by the belting. In the first place, they're careful--the father warns the son and so on--and in the second, there's nothing about 'em for the belting to catch on unless the man shoves his hand in. Oh, a native's no fool! He knows that it doesn't do to be foolish when he's dealing with a crane or a driving-wheel. You're looking at all those chopped rails? We make our iron as they blend baccy. We mix up all sorts to get the required quality. Those rails have just been chopped by this tobacco-cutter thing." [...] Experience bends down and sets a vicious-looking, parrot-headed beam to work. There is a quiver--a snap--and a dull smash and a heavy rail is nipped in two like a stick of barley-sugar.|$|R
