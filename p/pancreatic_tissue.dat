Methods: Cancerous <b>pancreatic</b> and pericarcinous <b>tissues</b> from 50 patients with pancreatic cancer and six healthy <b>pancreatic</b> <b>tissues</b> were collected from the pathological specimens of traumatic patients to distinguish Tim- 3 expression using immunohistochemistry. Tim- 3 expression was observed to be correlated with cell invasion, metastasis, and recurrence of pancreatic cancer. Results: 1. For the immunohistochemical method, Tim- 3 expression in <b>pancreatic</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> was observed to be elevated and statistically significant (P   . 05) was observed between Tim- 3 expression in pericarcinous and normal <b>pancreatic</b> <b>tissues.</b> 2. While Tim- 3 expression was observed to be {{closely related to the}} history of smoking, fasting blood glucose, tumor size, TNM stage, it was not observed to be related to gender, age, tumor location, pathological type, and degree of tumor differentiation.

40|$|The {{transient}} receptor potential melastatin-subfamily member 8 (TRPM 8) channels control Ca 2 + homeostasis. Recent {{studies indicate}} that TRPM 8 channels are aberrantly expressed and required for cellular proliferation in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, the functional significance of TRPM 8 in <b>pancreatic</b> <b>tissues</b> is mostly unknown. The objectives {{of this study are}} to examine the expression of TRPM 8 in various histopathological types of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>tissues,</b> determine its clinical significance in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and investigate its functional role in cancer cells invasion. We present evidence that, in normal <b>pancreatic</b> <b>tissues,</b> anti-TRPM 8 immunoreactivity is detected in the centroacinar cells and the islet endocrine cells. In pre-malignant <b>pancreatic</b> <b>tissues</b> and malignant neoplasms, TRPM 8 is aberrantly expressed to variable extents. In the majority of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, TRPM 8 is expressed at moderate or high levels, and anti-TRPM 8 immunoreactivity positively correlates with the primary tumor size and stage. In the pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines that express relatively high levels of TRPM 8, short hairpin RNA-mediated interference of TRPM 8 expression impaired their ability of invasion. These data suggest that aberrantly expressed TRPM 8 channels play contributory roles in pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis, and support exploration of TRPM 8 as a biomarker and target of pancreatic adenocarcinoma...|$|R
2500|$|The {{concept of}} islet {{transplantation}} is not new. [...] Investigators {{as early as}} the English surgeon Charles Pybus (1882–1975) attempted to graft <b>pancreatic</b> <b>tissue</b> to cure diabetes. Most, however, credit the recent era of islet transplantation research to Paul Lacy's studies dating back more than three decades. In 1967, Lacy's group described a novel collagenase-based method (later modified by Dr. Camillo Ricordi, then working with Dr. Lacy) to isolate islets, paving the way for future in vitro and in vivo islet experiments. Subsequent studies showed that transplanted islets could reverse diabetes in both rodents and non-human primates. In a summary of the 1977 Workshop on Pancreatic Islet Cell Transplantation in Diabetes, Lacy commented on the feasibility of “islet cell transplantation as a therapeutic approach [...] the possible prevention of the complications of diabetes in man”. Improvements in isolation techniques and immunosuppressive regimens ushered in the first human islet transplantation clinical trials in the mid-1980s. The first successful trial of human islet allotransplantation resulting in long-term reversal of diabetes was performed at the University of Pittsburgh in 1990. Yet despite continued procedural improvements, only about 10% of islet recipients in the late 1990s achieved euglycemia (normal blood glucose). In 2000, Dr. James Shapiro and colleagues published a report describing seven consecutive patients who achieved euglycemia following islet transplantation using a steroid-free protocol and large numbers of donor islets, since referred to as the Edmonton protocol. This protocol has been adapted by islet transplant centers around the world and has greatly increased islet transplant success.|$|E

40|$|The {{expression}} of heat-shock protein 60 (also known as chaperonin 60, Cpn 60) in experimental acute pancreatitis (AP) {{is considered to}} {{play an active role}} in the prevention of abnormal enzyme accumulation and activation in pancreatic acinar cells. However, there are controversial results in the literature regarding the relationship between the abnormality of Cpn 60 expression and AP onset and development. The purpose of this study was to investigate the alternations of Cpn 60 expression and the relationship between the abnormal {{expression of}} Cpn 60 and AP progression in rat severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) models. In this report, we induced SAP in Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats by reverse injection of sodium deoxycholate into the pancreatic duct, and examined the dynamic changes of Cpn 60 expression in <b>pancreatic</b> <b>tissues</b> from different time points and at different levels with techniques of real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. At 1  h after SAP induction, the expression of Cpn 60 mRNA in the AP <b>pancreatic</b> <b>tissues</b> was higher than those in the sham-operation group and normal control group, but decreased sharply as the time period was extended, and there was a significant difference between 1  h and 10  h after SAP induction (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). In the AP process, Cpn 60 protein expression showed transient elevation as well, and the increased protein expression occurred predominantly in affected, but not totally destroyed, pancreatic acinar cells. As AP progressed, the <b>pancreatic</b> <b>tissues</b> were seriously damaged, leading to a decreased overall Cpn 60 protein expression.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pancreatic {{cancer is}} a lethal disease with a 5 -year {{survival}} rate of only 1 - 5 %. The acceleration of intraoperative histological examination would be beneficial for better management of pancreatic cancer, suggesting an improved survival. Nonlinear optical methods based on two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and second harmonic generation (SHG) of intrinsic optical biomarkers show the ability to visualize the morphology of fresh tissues associated with histology, which is promising for real-time intraoperative evaluation of pancreatic cancer. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In order to investigate whether the nonlinear optical imaging methods {{have the ability to}} characterize pancreatic histology at cellular resolution, we studied different types of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>tissues</b> by using label-free TPEF and SHG. Compared with other routine methods for the preparation of specimens, fresh tissues without processing were found to be most suitable for nonlinear optical imaging of <b>pancreatic</b> <b>tissues.</b> The detailed morphology of the normal rat pancreas was observed and related with the standard histological images. Comparatively speaking, the preliminary images of a small number of chemical-induced <b>pancreatic</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> showed visible neoplastic differences in the morphology of cells and extracellular matrix. The subcutaneous pancreatic tumor xenografts were further observed using the nonlinear optical microscopy, showing that most cells are leucocytes at 5 days after implantation, the tumor cells begin to proliferate at 10 days after implantation, and the extracellular collagen fibers become disordered as the xenografts grow. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, nonlinear optical imaging was used to characterize the morphological details of fresh <b>pancreatic</b> <b>tissues</b> for the first time.
