40|$|The {{failure of}} list prices {{to reflect the}} reality of {{transaction}} price movement in the steel industry, especially {{over the course of}} the business cycle, was a prob-lem that had long been recognized by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). When the Bureau began to publish steel industry price indexes under its revi-sion methodology for the producer price index (PPI) in July 1982, it hoped to overcome this well-known weakness as well as others, including the bias due to the reliance on “volume sellers. ” The introduction of the new indexes oc-curred in the closing months of the deep 1981 - 82 economic recession. How-ever, the attempts by BLS to improve the type of steel price reported in the 1980 s were largely unsuccessful. The problem of obtaining valid price in-dexes became acute as the domestic steel industry’s output and employment crumbled over the period from 1982 to 1985 and discounting below list be-came intense. In January 1986, the major steel producers raised net transac-tion prices while substantially lowering list prices. The latter was reflected in a 4. 2 percent decline in the index for PPIR (Producer <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> <b>Revision...</b>|$|R

30|$|After {{testing that}} online {{interest}} is predictive {{of time on}} market, we now test whether it is predictive of <b>price</b> <b>revisions.</b> In our dataset, about 25 % of the dwellings had a price change; out of these, about 6 % had an increase in price, and the complementary 94 % had a price decrease. These figures are consistent with data from the Italian Housing Market Survey (jointly run by Banca d’Italia), showing that the share of transactions in which the actual transaction price was equal or higher than the asking price was about 3.0 % in 2015, 5.1 % in 2016 and 5.6 % in 2017. However, there are two caveats that we should make here. First, these <b>price</b> <b>revisions</b> {{do not necessarily reflect}} the transaction <b>price</b> (other <b>revisions</b> may occur during offline bargaining). Second, we cannot know why <b>price</b> <b>revisions</b> occurred. In particular, in the case of price increases, this may reflect an auction, but also the fact that the agency corrected a wrong posted price. Yet, our imperfect measures for <b>price</b> <b>revisions</b> carry information, and so it is useful to see what the effect of online interest is on them.|$|R
30|$|We {{construct}} two variables, RELCLICKS and RELCONTACTS, {{to quantify}} the relative interest in a particular dwelling with respect to all other dwellings in the same OMI microzone. In the case of time on market, RELCLICKS and RELCONTACTS are defined as {{the total number of}} clicks/contacts on an ad, divided by the average number of clicks/contacts in the corresponding OMI microzone during the same period in which the ad has been online. In the case of <b>price</b> <b>revisions,</b> this definition would not work. Indeed, <b>price</b> <b>revisions</b> trigger a change of online interest, {{as can be seen in}} Fig.  3 D. This would lead to a dubious interpretation of the results. To solve this problem, when analyzing <b>price</b> <b>revisions</b> we define RELCLICKS and RELCONTACTS as the ratio of clicks/contacts in the first 14 days since the ad was posted to the average of the OMI microzone in the same period. (We also discard ads that had a <b>price</b> <b>revision</b> within 15 days.) This choice is justified by the peak of clicks/contacts in the first few days after ads are posted (Fig.  3 A–B).|$|R

Moreover, we find that positive <b>price</b> <b>revisions</b> results in higher underpricing. Lastly, we do not find any relationship between SVI during the filing period and post-IPO performance. Instead, we find that SCOOP rating, representing expected first-day premium, predicts underperformance. Hence, our results are more in line with the anticipation theory than the attention theory. In addition, we find that IPOs with very high or very low first-day return underperform other IPOs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the price-setting process for Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) {{is influenced by}} Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations. The findings indicate a significant positive relation between underpricing {{and the presence of}} a regulatory constraint requiring an amendment for a large price change. IPOs with positive <b>price</b> <b>revisions</b> constrained at the regulatory threshold are significantly more underpriced than IPOs undertaking positive <b>price</b> <b>revisions</b> exceeding the regulatory limit. This association is reversed, albeit weaker, for IPOs with negative <b>price</b> <b>revisions.</b> Offerings with constrained downward <b>price</b> <b>revisions</b> tend to be more over-priced. Exceeding the regulatory threshold and filing an amendment imposes additional cost and risk by delaying the offering. Additionally, incorporating a price change exceeding the regulatory threshold is associated with an increased risk of offering failure. Thus, there are off-setting costs making it rational for issuers to “leave money on the table. ” In addition, the regulatory constraints provide a possible alternative explanation for the partial adjustment phenomenon. In response to unexpectedly high demand, the issuer might only partially adjust the offer price in order to stay within the allowable pricing threshold and avoiding delaying the offering. For positive revisions of the offer price, the results show a significant positive relationship between underpricing and offer <b>price</b> <b>revision</b> up to the point of the regulatory threshold, while the slope change at the regulatory threshold is negative and significant. I interpret these results as consistent with the hypothesis that SEC regulations are an impediment to accurate pricing of IPOs. ...|$|R

This paper incorporates <b>price</b> <b>revision</b> information into the study of this relationship.

To our knowledge we are the first to do so. We model each side of the order book separately using ordered probit models for submissions, forward and backward revisions, and order cancellations. In essence, we rank the aggressiveness of order submissions, revisions and cancellations based upon {{the impact of}} the action on the execution probability of the order. The empirical results indicate that the aggressiveness of order submissions and forward <b>price</b> <b>revisions</b> react to the existing and subsequent changes in the execution probability driven in part by the depth {{on either side of the}} order book.

Moreover, we are able to confirm the theory put forward by Lazear (1986) on the relation between atypical goods and the speed of price adjustments.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse a {{railroad}} cartel {{run by the}} Joint Executive Committee (JEC) in the United States in the nineteenth century. The JEC was a cartel whose members anticipated a periodic fall in demand due to competition from the Great Lakes. In a simplified situation we model the optimal price setting behaviour of a cartel that fully anticipates a large and prolonged (infinite) switch to {{a lower level of}} demand. We show that joint profit maximisation is not sustainable as a perfect equilibrium before the switch (in the lakes closed regimes). We also show that an optimal cartel may have had to revise its official rate downwards in the periods leading up to the infinite switch in demand. Empirically we show that the number of weeks leading up to the opening of the lakes is a significant factor in explaining downward <b>price</b> <b>revisions</b> by the JEC in lakes closed regimes.
