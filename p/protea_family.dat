50|$|Lomatia is a genus of 12 {{species of}} {{evergreen}} flowering {{plants in the}} <b>protea</b> <b>family</b> Proteaceae. Within the family, they have been placed, alone, in their own subtribe, Lomatiinae according to Johnson & Briggs 1975 classification {{of the family and}} subsequently in Flora of Australia (1995).|$|E
5000|$|Faurea is a genus {{containing}} 15 {{species of}} flowering {{plants in the}} <b>protea</b> <b>family</b> which occur in the summer rainfall area of southern Africa, extending to tropical Africa and Madagascar. The name honours South African soldier and botanist William Caldwell Faure (1822-1844) who was killed on active service in India.|$|E
5000|$|The Southwest Australia garden 12.50 acres {{will hold}} four {{collections}} from two areas of Australia; {{a garden of}} the <b>protea</b> <b>family,</b> kwongan (small groupings of eucalyptus woodlands and associated thickets), karri, marri, and jarrah forest (a display of giant eucalyptus trees that rank among the tallest trees in the world) and grass tree slope.|$|E
50|$|He was {{instrumental}} in preserving the habitat of the orange-bellied parrot {{and it was in}} Melaleuca that he discovered the extinct tree or shrub Banksia kingii. King also discovered a species of eyebright, Euphrasia kingii (nowadays known as Euphrasia gibbsiae subspecies kingii), as well as a flowering evergreen in the <b>Protea</b> <b>family</b> (Proteaceae): King's Lomatia (also known as King's holly, Lomatia tasmanica).|$|E
50|$|Grevillea oxyantha is a plant {{from the}} <b>Protea</b> <b>family,</b> {{found in the}} cold {{mountain}} regions of southern New South Wales, Australia. The species grows from one to three metres in height. They are often found on rocky places, near cliffs or occasionally near streams. Rock types are mostly granite or quartzite. Nearby localities include Wee Jasper, Tumut, Batlow and Brown Mountain.|$|E
50|$|It {{seems that}} the ancient and {{spectacular}} <b>Protea</b> <b>family</b> originated in Gondwanaland, {{hundreds of millions of}} years ago. The different species were gradually separated by plate tectonics and their descendants still occur on the pieces of land that are now separated by thousands of miles of ocean. Brabejum is the lone survivor of its branch of the family on the African remnant of Gondwanaland.|$|E
50|$|Stenocarpus sinuatus, {{known as}} the Firewheel Tree is an Australian {{rainforest}} tree in the <b>Protea</b> <b>family.</b> The range of natural distribution is in various rainforest types from the Nambucca River (30° S) in New South Wales to the Atherton Tableland (17° S) in tropical Queensland. However, Stenocarpus sinuatus is widely planted as an ornamental tree {{in other parts of}} Australia and {{in different parts of the}} world.|$|E
5000|$|The name Silwerboomkloof means “Valley of the Silvertrees”. The rare Silvertree (Leucadendron argenteum) is a striking, silver-coloured tree of the <b>Protea</b> <b>family,</b> {{and this}} reserve conserves {{a forest of}} them. The iconic Silvertree is {{actually}} indigenous to the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, making the population at Silwerboomkloof {{a bit of an}} isolated anomaly.This 4,9 hectare reserve encloses a section of “Granite Fynbos” and “Renosterveld” and a total of around 220 species of plant have been recorded.|$|E
50|$|Vegetation in {{the region}} is mainly woody, {{including}} forests, woodlands, shrublands, and heathlands, but no grasslands. Predominant vegetation types are Eucalyptus woodlands, eucalyptus-dominated Mallee shrublands, and kwongan shrublands and heathlands, which correspond to the chaparral, matorral, maquis, and fynbos shrublands found in other Mediterranean-type regions. The region has generally nutrient-poor sandy or lateritic soils, which has encouraged rich speciation of plants adapted to specific ecological niches. The region hosts a great diversity of endemic species, notably among the <b>protea</b> <b>family</b> (Proteaceae).|$|E
50|$|Diastella is a genus {{containing}} seven {{species of}} flowering plants, {{commonly known as}} “silkypuffs”, in the <b>protea</b> <b>family.</b> The name comes from the Greek diastellein “to separate”, {{with reference to the}} free perianth lobes - the plants are distinguished from the closely related and similar leucospermums by the possession of four free perianth segments. The genus is endemic to the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa where it has a very limited range and is associated with fynbos habitats. The species are all small shrubs. Most species are threatened.|$|E
50|$|The natural {{occurrence}} of these trees in South Africa is of considerable interest to biologists. This is because Brabejum has no close relatives in Africa - within the enormous <b>Protea</b> <b>family</b> its nearest relative is the Macadamia tree of Australia and New Caledonia. Its other more distant relatives likewise exist only in Australasia and South America. In fact, {{not only is}} this species alone in its Brabejum genus, it is also the only member of its sub-family, Grevilleoideae, in Africa (the proteas that surround it in South Africa are relatively distant relatives).|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the region}} is covered with fynbos, a {{sclerophyllous}} shrubland occurring on acid sands or nutrient poor soils derived from Table Mountain Sandstones (Cape Supergroup). Fynbos is home to an amazing diversity of plant species including {{many members of the}} <b>Protea</b> <b>family</b> (Proteaceae), Heath family (Ericaceae), and Reed family of restios (Restionaceae). Other vegetation types are sandveld, a soft coastal scrubland found mostly on the west-facing coast of the Western Cape Province, on tertiary sands. Renosterveld is a grassy shrubland dominated by members of the Daisy family (Asteraceae - particularly renosterbos (Elytropappus rhinocerotis), graminoids and geophytes, occurring on the base-rich shaley soils of the coastal forelands. Small pockets of Afromontane forest (Southern Afrotemperate Forest) can be found in humid and sheltered areas.|$|E
50|$|Agastachys odorata, {{commonly}} known as the white waratah, is the sole member of the genus Agastachys in the <b>protea</b> <b>family.</b> It is an evergreen shrub to small tree and is endemic to the heaths and button grass sedgelands of western Tasmania. It occurs most often in moist heath and scrub and occasionally in the alpine regions, but generally prefers well-drained but poor soils. It can grow in some rainforests where it forms a small tree but is normally a shrub in all other situations. The heaviest concentrations are along the island's south coast. Its leaves are dark green, hairless and almost succulent. Masses of white flowers are produced in erect spikes from the ends of the branches. Measuring 8 to 12 cm high, they appear in January and February.|$|E
40|$|Domestication of a South African {{group of}} Proteaceae, the proteas, began with their {{cultivation}} as exotics in Europe. A growing local {{interest in their}} cultivation climaxed in {{the publication of a}} popular handbook in 1958. Commercial interest in cultivation and seed sources was stimulated and led to a botanical and horticultural survey of useful species throughout their distribution range in the fynbos. Information pamphlets on cultivation requirements and seed were eventually supplied to the public as an official service. Up to 1970 cut-flowers were harvested in limited quantities, mainly from the western Cape folded mountains, and sold on the European markets. During the last decade, the export trade in fresh Proteaceae flowers has become a significant factor in the national economy. However, the original system of harvesting from the natural habitat has caused serious marketing problems, for instance, poor cut-flower quality and an erratic supply of many species. Increased exploitation has also led to unprecedented disruptive pressure on the fynbos biome system, particularly on the Proteaceae-component. It is clear that the scientific cultivation of the <b>protea</b> <b>family</b> as a floricultural crop is necessary' for its sustained growth as an economic factor, as well as for its natural conservation. The present paper gives an overview of the developments that led to the rise of the fynbos Proteaceae as a commercially cultivated crop in South Africa. </p...|$|E
