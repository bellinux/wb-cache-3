5|$|The Americans stopped sharing any {{information}} on heavy water production, the method of electromagnetic separation, the physical or chemical properties of plutonium, the details of bomb design, or the facts about fast neutron reactions. This was a major disappointment which hindered the British and the Canadians, who were collaborating on heavy water production and several {{other aspects of the}} research programme. By 1943 Britain had stopped sending its scientists to the United States, which slowed down the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> there, which had relied on efforts led by British scientists. In March 1943 Conant approached the Military Policy Committee, which decided that Britain's help would benefit some areas of the project. Chadwick, Penney, Peierls, Oliphant and other British scientists were important enough that the bomb design team at the Los Alamos Laboratory needed them, despite the risk of revealing weapon design secrets.|$|E
5|$|All four {{ships were}} laid down on 16 June 1909, {{but this was}} just a {{ceremonial}} event as actual work did not begin until September–October. One major complication was that the design for the turrets and their magazines was not completed when construction began so their weights and dimensions had to be estimated. The machinery for these ships was built by either the Baltic Works or the Franco-Russian Works as the New Admiralty Shipyard lacked its own engine shop. Construction was initially very slow because the Duma did not allocate any money for these ships until May 1911. Initial funding was taken from other budget items or the emperor's discretionary fund and the shipyards had to use their own money to keep the work going. They were enormously expensive with their cost estimated at 29.4 million rubles each, including armament. By way of comparison the preceding class of pre-dreadnoughts had only cost 11 million rubles each. Once the Duma provided the funding the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> accelerated and the ships were launched later that year, although delays in the delivery of engines and turrets hindered their completion. All of the ships completed abbreviated trials by the end of 1914 and reached the fleet in December 1914 – January 1915.|$|E
25|$|By 1912, the Lawrence mills {{at maximum}} {{capacity}} employed about 32,000 men, women, and children. Conditions had grown even worse for {{workers in the}} decade before the strike. The introduction of the two-loom system in the woolen mills led to a dramatic speedup in the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> The increase in production enabled the factory owners to lay off large numbers of workers. Those who kept their jobs earned, on average, $8.76 for 56 hours of work.|$|E

25|$|This {{group had}} {{acquired}} some {{influence on the}} docks through its publication The Waterfront Worker, a mimeographed sheet sold for a penny that published articles written by longshoremen and seamen, almost always under pseudonyms. These articles focused on workers' day-to-day concerns: the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> the weight of loads, abusive bosses, and unsafe working conditions. While the first editions {{were published in the}} apartment of an MWIU member on a second-hand mimeograph machine, the paper remained independent of both the party and the MWIU.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, the Great Depression made matters worse. The {{economic}} collapse drove {{a number of}} New England and Mid-Atlantic manufacturers into bankruptcy, while those employers who survived laid off workers and increased the amount and <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> for their employees even further. Textile workers across the region, from worsted workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts and silk weavers in Paterson, New Jersey, to cotton millhands in Greenville, South Carolina, engaged in hundreds of isolated strikes, {{even though there were}} thousands of unemployed workers desperate to take their places.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of the brand, applicants for jobs at Apple Stores are numerous, with many young workers applying. The <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> is high due to {{the popularity}} of the iPhone and iPad. Employees typically work for only a few years as career prospects are limited with no path of advancement other than limited retail management slots. Apple Store employees make above-average pay for retail employees and are offered money toward college tuitions, gym memberships, health care, 401(k) plans, product discounts, and reduced price on purchase of stock. The retention rate for the technicians who man the Genius Bar is over 90%.|$|E

50|$|The See of Goa is {{the largest}} {{building}} built by the Portuguese in Asia, 91 meters long and very wide, which probably contributed to the slow <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>works.</b> The church has three naves of equal height, shaped hall-church, as do other Portuguese cathedrals of time as the Sees of Miranda do Douro (begun in 1552), Leiria (begun in 1559) and Portalegre (begun in 1556). The severe façade with three portals, has one tower: the right was destroyed during a storm in 1766. The church naves are vaulted and separated by two rows of pillars. Interior decoration stands out the magnificent altarpiece of the chancel in gilt.|$|R
50|$|During the Depression, {{the mill}} tried to {{increase}} production {{through a variety of}} methods such as increased hours and quickening the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> the <b>work.</b> In 1932, the United Textile Workers of America (UTWA) called a strike, but it failed. The workers did not participate in a nationwide UTWA strike in 1934.|$|R
500|$|From February onwards, the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> increased; {{more than}} 1,000 breadfruit plants were potted and carried into the ship, where they filled the great cabin. The ship was {{overhauled}} {{for the long}} homeward voyage, in many cases by men who regretted the forthcoming departure and loss of their easy life with the Tahitians. Bligh was impatient to be away, but as Richard Hough observes in his account, he [...] "failed to anticipate how his company would react to the severity and austerity of life at sea... after five dissolute, hedonistic months at Tahiti". The work was done by 1 April 1789, and four days later, after an affectionate farewell from Tynah and his queen, Bounty left the harbour.|$|E
2500|$|The NIRA quickly promulgated a {{code for}} the cotton {{industry}} regulating workers' hours {{and establishing a}} minimum wage; it also established a committee to study the problem of workloads. In the meantime, however, the employers responded to the new minimum wages by increasing the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> [...] When the labor board set a forty-hour work week, mill owners required {{the same amount of}} work in those forty hours as they had in the previous fifty- to sixty-hour week.|$|E

Each country {{had the right to}} seat four of its members on each committee. This resulted in a set of large groups, likened by American delegate A.M. Simons to [...] "miniature Congresses," [...] and made for a slow and methodical <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Each speech was delivered in three languages, German, French, and English — the original plus two translations.|$|E
50|$|After The Seeds of Love, Orzabal and Smith had an acrimonious {{falling out}} and parted company in 1991.

2500|$|Preparation for the Games {{received}} widespread {{international media}} attention, with criticism being levelled against the organisers for the slow <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> {{as well as}} issues related to security and hygiene. However, all member nations of the Commonwealth of Nations participated in the event, except Fiji, which is suspended from the Commonwealth, and Tokelau, which didn't send a team, in spite of threats of boycotts and athlete withdrawals. The internationally acclaimed opening ceremony improved {{the image of the}} Games, and dispelled negative notions surrounding them, with many observers remarking that they began on an apprehensive note, but were an exceptional experience with a largely positive ending. The President of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, said that India had made a good foundation for a future Olympics bid, which was reiterated by the Australian Ministry of Sports. Commonwealth games Federation chief Mike Fennell stated that [...] "Delhi delivered a fantastic Games". Some observers accused sections of the media of bias, unfair expectations, and negative reporting.|$|E
2500|$|On December 8, {{the four}} new characters, which match {{the size of}} those taken down, {{were placed on the}} lawn in the {{afternoon}} {{by the side of the}} gate in advance of their installation. Also on that afternoon, the last bolt was hammered to complete the installation of the new [...] "Liberty Square" [...] inscription on the front side of the arch. At the same time, the new plaque for the main hall, bearing the name [...] "National Taiwan Democracy Hall", was shown publicly for the first time. The plaque over the hall itself would be separated into 15 smaller pieces and removed. The official reopening of the site was scheduled for December 9. However, the slow <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> postponed the reopening until the next day. The delay was caused by the requirement to carefully align each character, with ground crews having to stand approximately 100 meters away and guide the team on the crane who were affixing the characters. On December 6, city government's Labor Standard Inspection Office had issued an order to halt all work on the gate inscriptions, citing unsafe scaffolding.|$|E

2500|$|The {{nature of}} work changed during {{industrialisation}} from a craft production model to a factory-centric model. It {{was during the}} years 1761 to 1850 that these changes happened. Textile factories organized workers' lives much differently from craft production. [...] Handloom weavers worked at their own pace, with their own tools, and within their own cottages. [...] Factories set hours of work, and the machinery within them shaped the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> [...] Factories brought workers together within one building to work on machinery {{that they did not}} own. [...] Factories also increased the division of labour. [...] They narrowed the number and scope of tasks. They included children and women within a common production process. As Manchester mill owner Friedrich Engels decried, the family structure itself was [...] "turned upside down" [...] as women's wages undercut men's, forcing men to [...] "sit at home" [...] and care for children while the wife worked long hours. Factories flourished over manual craftsmanship because they had more efficient production output per worker, keeping prices down for the public, and they had much more consistent quality of product. [...] The work-discipline was forcefully instilled upon the workforce by the factory owners, and he found that the working conditions were poor, and poverty levels were at an unprecedented high. Engels was appalled, and his research in Derby played a large role in his and Marx's book 'Das Kapital'.|$|E
2500|$|Working {{conditions}} were hard and the pay very low, {{because it was}} based on the lowest local wage and unlike unemployment payments did not include an allowance for living expenses. There was also no payment until winter 1938 for bad weather days when work could not take place. Workers were initially housed in barracks, barns, industrial buildings, and tents, and complained about the work, the conditions, and the pay. On October 18, 1934, the workers on the Hamburg-Bremen segment of the autobahn at Gyhum went on strike; the 141 who could not be talked into resuming work were transported to Berlin for interrogation by the Gestapo. To avoid a recurrence of such problems, a policy was put in place of investigating men for political reliability before they were hired for work on the autobahn, access to the workers' camps was restricted, a surveillance network was instituted in which the Gestapo participated increasingly, and the few SA members among the workers were organized into Baustürme ("construction storms") that provided both example and intimidation at work sites. There were nonetheless several further strikes in 1935, and increasing numbers of fires were ascribed to sabotage by disgruntled workers. Todt attempted to make worker housing into [...] "worthy lodgings", and had camps specially built, beginning with a model camp at Werbellin on the Berlin-Stettin autobahn that was opened in December 1934. Kraft durch Freude entertainment, books, and propaganda movies were also provided from that point on. One worker wrote in 1975 of the camp where he had lived in 1937 that he would still describe the living conditions as [...] "absolutely model". However, conditions remained very poor. Work sites were often remote, as far as two hours' march from the camp, and had no access to food or water. The pressure on the workers was considerable, especially after Hitler publicly alluded in 1937 to the objective of completing [...] a year. After mid-1936, workdays lasting 11 to 12 hours were the norm. There was a high incidence of back injuries to men who were unaccustomed to physical work after long unemployment and in many cases undernourished. Numerous accidents occurred, some fatal, due to the rapid <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> exhaustion, and unfamiliarity with heavy machinery; after the first five years, one worker died per [...] completed.|$|E

50|$|In 2004 the Ukrainian {{government}} assured further {{means for}} {{the completion of the}} metro by 2010.

50|$|Pitman {{worked as}} a {{freelance}} musician, employing an answering service to help him schedule recording dates. Studios covered the cost of cartage, an important perquisite considering the number of instruments and ancillary gear needed to meet the eclectic demands of music producers.

During one year, Pitman logged an astonishing 425 recording sessions, many of which resulted in multiple sides.|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{advantages}} of this form of learning is that students at the very least set the <b>pace</b> <b>of</b> their <b>work.</b> Depending on the individual center, students can also set the level and content <b>of</b> their <b>work.</b> Students can use these centers voluntarily or can have assignments to complete there. The major advantage, therefore, is flexibility, with the purpose of giving the students themselves the opportunity to tailor the course more to their learning needs and styles than a more traditional mode of teaching.|$|R

50|$|The {{conditions}} in the construction sites were harsh. Severe climate, poor accommodation, insufficient nutrition and sickness took a toll on the men.

40|$|A {{grade of}} A {{was given in}} an {{introductory}} statistics course for meeting a set of contingencies that included no <b>work</b> outside <b>of</b> class (except by request), near-perfect performance on exams following each unit <b>of</b> <b>work</b> in a programmed text, correction of all exam errors, self <b>pacing</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> {{and the chance to}} finish the course early. A grade of incomplete was given otherwise. Correlations among performance measures failed to show any meaningful relationships between time taken to finish the course, errors made on exams, and errors made in the programmed text. Responses to a five-part questionnaire were overwhelmingly favorable to the course, but did not vary as a function of grade point average, time taken to finish the course, or number of errors made on exams. The uniformly high level of performance, the students' lack of interest in social contact with the instructor during class, and the absence of drop-outs are all attributed to the contingencies employed, chief among which, according to the instructor's judgment and student rankings, were self-pacing, frequent non-punitive exams and a guaranteed grade of A for near-perfect work at every stage...|$|R
