5|$|A {{black hole}} is {{a region of}} spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is <b>possible</b> <b>is</b> called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.|$|E
5|$|Kim <b>Possible</b> <b>is</b> an American {{animated}} action comedy-adventure {{television series}} created by Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle that originally aired on Disney Channel from June 7, 2002 to September 7, 2007. The show revolves around eponymous {{high school student}} Kim Possible, a teenager tasked with fighting crime {{on a regular basis}} while coping with everyday issues commonly associated with adolescence. Kim is aided by her clumsy best friend and sidekick Ron Stoppable, his pet naked mole rat Rufus and 10 year-old computer genius Wade. Known collectively as Team Possible, the majority of Kim and Ron's missions require them to thwart the evil plans of mad scientist–supervillain duo Dr. Drakken and his sidekick Shego, but they occasionally encounter other enemies as well.|$|E

25|$|A {{more general}} {{situation}} where this trick is <b>possible</b> <b>is</b> with Omega-groups (in the general sense allowing operators with multiple arity).

25|$|The one {{condition}} on the automorphism for folding to be <b>possible</b> <b>is</b> that distinct nodes of the graph {{in the same}} orbit (under the automorphism) must not be connected by an edge; {{at the level of}} root systems, roots in the same orbit must be orthogonal. At the level of diagrams, this is necessary as otherwise the quotient diagram will have a loop, due to identifying two nodes but having an edge between them, and loops are not allowed in Dynkin diagrams.|$|E
25|$|This process {{includes}} several steps such as filtration, evaporation, drying, grinding, and sifting. These operations are concentration-dependent and also {{dependent on the}} particular gelatin used. Gelatin degradation should be avoided and minimized, so the lowest temperature <b>possible</b> <b>is</b> used for the recovery process. Most recoveries are rapid, {{with all of the}} processes being done in several stages to avoid extensive deterioration of the peptide structure. A deteriorated peptide structure would result in a low gel strength, which is not generally desired.|$|E

40|$|What I {{call the}} {{argument}} from almost indiscernibles is an argument, {{put forward by}} Robert Adams in 1979, {{for the possibility of}} indiscernibles based on the possibility of almost indiscernibles. The argument is that if almost indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> but since almost indiscernible <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible.</b> The argument seems to be an improvement over the mere appeal to intuitions, like that suggested by Max Black, that situations in which there <b>are</b> indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> for the argument purports to give us a reason that indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible.</b> In this paper I shall assess the argument by examining whether there is support for the conditional premise that if almost indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible.</b> I shall argue that there are reasons to think that either the premise lacks support or almost indiscernibles are dispensable. If the premise lacks support, the argument does not establish the possibility of almost indiscernibles; if almost indiscernibles are dispensable, the argument is not needed to establish the possibility of indiscernibles...|$|R

25|$|Total body photography, which {{involves}} photographic documentation {{of as much}} body surface as <b>possible,</b> <b>is</b> often used during follow-up for high-risk patients. The technique {{has been reported to}} enable early detection and provides a cost-effective approach (with any digital camera), but its efficacy has been questioned due to its inability to detect macroscopic changes. The diagnosis method should be used in conjunction with (and not as a replacement for) dermoscopic imaging, with a combination of both methods appearing to give extremely high rates of detection.|$|E
25|$|In {{systematic}} chemical nomenclature, alkynes {{are named}} with the Greek prefix system without any additional letters. Examples include ethyne or octyne. In parent chains with {{four or more}} carbons, {{it is necessary to}} say where the triple bond is located. For octyne, one can either write 3-octyne or oct-3-yne when the bond starts at the third carbon. The lowest number <b>possible</b> <b>is</b> given to the triple bond. When no superior functional groups are present, the parent chain must include the triple bond even if it is not the longest possible carbon chain in the molecule. Ethyne is commonly called by its trivial name acetylene.|$|E
