5000|$|In 1834, the War Department Pension Office became {{suspicious}} of fraud attempts following the Pension Act of 1832. The new U.S. District Attorney in Lewis County, West Virginia, Washington G. Singleton, began investigating pension applicants one-on-one. As most men were illiterate, {{they could not}} refresh their memory by reading their <b>pension</b> <b>statement.</b> Singleton's reports were eye opening. In Lewis County alone, he judged sixty three of eighty eight pensions to be fraudulent and {{in the rest of}} West Virginia he deemed fifty six percent of pension applications fraudulent. Singleton claimed the pension agents were crooked. Turns out, Singleton may have been the crooked one. His judgement seemed to be impaired on many pension applications. For example, in the application of Thomas Smith (S15989 revwarapps.org), Singleton stated that Smith had [...] "but a small portion of mind," [...] concluding that [...] "he never done one particle of service in my opinion." [...] The pension commissioner, Col. James L. Edwards seemed to take Singleton's word blindly. As a result, about four dozen applicants were charged with fraud and denied pensions. However, when looking at the Lewis County files, 181 reliable files that proved service. Harries claims that of the 181 cases, 154 (85%) showed a close agreement between the narratives and the pension applications. In this case, only 8 of 181 (4%) pension applications were fraud.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2006, Historians Will Graves and C. Leon Harris {{along with}} the Southern Campaigns of the American Revolution (SCAR) decided to {{establish}} a huge research project. Graves began the project by transcribing pension applications from Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. Attempting to transcribe the Revolution pension statements {{from all of the}} colonies seemed unrealistic at first, however they have additionally completed transcribing pensions from Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, and have started pensions from New Jersey and New York. Harris and Graves hope to transcribe pensions of the North during their lifetime. In the transcription process, Will uses speech recognition software to transcribe the documents. The Southern Campaigns contain many crucial battles and are seen as {{a turning point in the}} war. After years of digging up pension statements with the help of other historians, they began to transcribe these historic documents. From studying various rosters, Harris estimates that one in every six Continental soldiers applied for pensions. They encourage anyone interested to help with the project. On , there are now 21,376 pensions available online. There are estimated to be just over 80,000 total pension statements, so it is remarkable to have transcribed over one fourth of them. [...] Each <b>pension</b> <b>statement</b> contains a letter followed by a number on the top of it. Graves and Harris explain exactly what these letters indicate: ...|$|E
40|$|The first aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{characterisation}} of techno-mathematical literacies needed for effective practice in modern, technology-rich workplaces that are both highly automated and increasingly focused on flexible response to customer needs. The second aim is to introduce an epistemological dimension to activity theory, specifically to the notions of boundary object and boundary crossing. In this paper we draw on ethnographic research in a pensions company and focus on data derived from detailed analysis of the diverse perspectives that exist with respect to one symbolic artefact, the annual <b>pension</b> <b>statement.</b> This statement is designed to facilitate boundary crossing between company and customers. Our study showed that the statement routinely failed in this communicative role, largely due to the invisible factors of the mathematical-financial models underlying the statement that are not made visible to customers, or to the customer enquiry team whose task is to communicate with customers. By focusing on this artefact in boundary-crossing situations, we identify and elaborate the nature of the techno-mathematical knowledge required for effective communication between different communities in one financial services workplace, and suggest the implications of our findings for workplaces more generally...|$|E
50|$|Fraud is {{more than}} just a {{possibility}} in these <b>pension</b> <b>statements</b> as there were 80,000 plus known pension applications. While Congress’ act of 1818 and 1820 discouraged military resignation and encouraged enlistment, it also allowed for poor colonists who did not serve to get fraud pensions from the United States Government. The pension office most commonly rejected pension applications because the soldier had not served nine months in the war. A small percentage of pension claims were rejected because the soldier’s name was not found on a roster. Widows often got rejected when they could not prove the date of their marriage with a veteran. Although these rejections were plentiful, there is no question the fraud <b>pension</b> <b>statements</b> were accepted by the pension office. So can the system be trusted especially decades after the war had ended? The short answer is yes. The pension application procedure required the applicant to appear before a court and describe under oath his or her service. Also, there exist many historical records that contain names of officers, battles, and places that are compared with <b>pension</b> <b>statements.</b> Veterans who actually served usually kept the war alive by talking about it with family and friends. As mentioned above, a lot of enlisted men as well as widows were illiterate which most likely means they had no documentation of their service. In a random sample held by Graves and Harris, only one pension application of two hundred turned out to be fraud because the applicant tried to impersonate a soldier who had already died.|$|R
40|$|In June 2012 the GASB {{approved}} {{a pair of}} related Statements that reflect substantial improvements to the accounting and financial reporting of pensions by {{state and local governments}} and <b>pension</b> plans. <b>Statement</b> No. 67, Financial Reporting for Pension Plans, addresses financial reporting for state and local government <b>pension</b> plans. <b>Statement</b> No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions, establishes new accounting and financial reporting requirements for governments that provide their employees with pensions. The guidance contained in these Statements will change how governments calculate and report the costs and obligations associated with pensions in important ways. It is designed to improve the decision-usefulness of reported pension information and to increase the transparency, consistency, and comparability of pension information across governments. Statement 67 replaces the requirements of Statement No. 25, Financial Reporting for Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Note Disclosures for Defined Contribution Plans, for most public employee <b>pension</b> plans. <b>Statement</b> 68 replaces the requirements of Statement No. 27, Accounting for Pensions by State and Local Governmental Employers, for most government employers. The new Statements also replace the requirements of <b>Statement</b> No. 50, <b>Pension</b> Disclosures, for those governments and pension plans...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. (Investment Management) Property {{investments}} {{have always}} been a major attraction to the private individual and the institutional investor. Pension funds were slow to venture into this market but in South Africa there was increasing activity in the property market by pension funds over the last eight to ten years. The main reason for this development {{can be attributed to the}} fact that inflation in South Africa caused salaries and wages to increase substantially and increased salaries and wages resulted in increased contributions to pension funds. Pension Fund Administrators were, and they still are, faced with ever-increasing cash flows which must be invested to meet long term commitments. Venturing into the property market, left pension funds at what could be termed the mercy of developers and Estate Agents. Standardisation of presentation of investment details and commonly used evaluation methods and procedures are lacking. Proper knowledge of legal and contractual requirements are being obtained from legal advisers, but the pension fund movement is not yet self supporting in any of these fields. This study is an effort to identify the legal aspects, contractual requirements, methods of property development and minimum requirements for evaluation purposes. Inherent in the requirements are those aspects worthy of special reference in relation to the decision making process. It may be said that property investment by the private individual is not different from that of the <b>pension</b> fund. This <b>statement</b> is, however, only partly true. The requirements for the decision making process depends on the objectives of the investor. The pension fund, for example, has a long term view and sustained growth in cash flow as well as capital appreciation of the investment over the long term is a major determinant...|$|R
