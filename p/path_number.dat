This has limited their use in practice despite demonstrations of their advantages over edge profiles {{for a wide variety}} of applications. We present a new algorithm called preferential path profiling (PPP), that reduces the overhead of path profiling. PPP leverages the observation that most consumers of path profiles are only interested in a subset of all program paths. PPP achieves low overhead by separating interesting paths from other paths and assigning a set of unique and compact numbers to these interesting paths. We draw a parallel between arithmetic coding and <b>path</b> <b>numbering,</b> and use this connection to prove an optimality result for the compactness of <b>path</b> <b>numbering</b> produced by PPP. This compact <b>path</b> <b>numbering</b> enables our PPP implementation to record path information in an array instead of a hash table.
