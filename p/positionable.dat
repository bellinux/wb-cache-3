50|$|A recent {{introduction}} {{into the}} micropipette field integrates the versatility of microfluidics into a freely <b>positionable</b> pipette platform. At {{the tip of}} the device a localized flow zone is created, allowing for constant control of the nanoliter environment, {{directly in front of the}} pipette. The pipettes are made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) which is formed using reactive injection molding. Interfacing of these pipettes using pneumatics enables multiple solutions to be loaded and switched on demand, with solution exchanged times of 100ms.Invented by Alar Ainla, currently situated in the Biophysical Technology Lab at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden.The technology became commercial in 2013, under the name Multifunctional pipette, with the company Fluicell (former Avalance Biotech AB).|$|E
50|$|Featured in {{the video}} game Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock (2012), {{this version of the}} Dalek Emperor first appears as a large, levitating, purple sphere, studded with silver hemispheres. This is shown to be a shell which can expand and split into sixteen {{vertical}} segments, <b>positionable</b> to form a defensive barrier. The internal structure is mainly of the New Paradigm design, consisting of a large dome incorporating a foreshortened eye stalk and thin, extended dome lights, supported by an inverted neck bin. Below this a conical metallic structure tapers downward towards a circular, rotating weapons platform to which it is connected by an energy field.

50|$|There {{are eight}} air bridges, at gates 12-17, 19, and 20. Gates 10-11, 18A-18H and 21C-21D {{transport}} passengers to the aircraft via an airside bus transfer. Gate 21A/B is an aircraft stand without an air bridge, {{with a short}} walk to the aircraft instead. The eight air bridges are not enough, so airside bus transfer is regularly used. Traditionally gates 10-15, which are accessed without clearing immigration, used {{to be limited to}} intra-Nordic flights but nowadays cater to all flights within the Schengen Area, which are treated as domestic flights.Gates 21A-21D are located in the international transit area, used for flights outside the Schengen Area, and access is only possible after clearing immigration. Gate 19 and 20 are <b>positionable</b> so that, depending on upcoming flights, reaching them may (signed 19B-20B) or may not (signed 19A-20A) require clearing immigration. The freight terminal uses gate numbers below 10.|$|E
5000|$|Both Fazioli and Mason and Hamlin (of Haverhill, Massachusetts) employ tunable duplex scaling. The {{idea behind}} duplex scaling, invented by Theodore Steinway in 1872, {{is that the}} non-speaking portion of the string, located between the non-speaking bridge pin and the hitch pin (formerly {{considered}} the [...] "waste end" [...] and damped with a strip of cloth), resounds in sympathy with the vibrating portion of the string. Steinway & Sons' earliest employment of the duplex scale made use of aliquots, individually <b>positionable</b> (hence tunable) contact points, where each note of the duplex scale bears a perfect harmonic, intervallic relationship to its speaking length, i.e., an octave or fifth whether doubled or tripled. Because it was time-consuming to correctly position each aliquot, Steinway abandoned individual aliquots for continuous cast metal bars, each comprising an entire section of duplex bridge points. Their feeling was that with an accurately templated bridge and carefully located duplex bar, the same result would be achieved with far less fuss.|$|E
50|$|A recent {{development}} is diverse field spectroscopy which combines {{the benefit of}} IFS with multi-object spectroscopy (MOS). MOS is used to collect light from many discrete objects over a wide field. This does not record spatial information - just the spectrum of the total light collected within each sampling aperture (usually {{the core of a}} <b>positionable</b> optical fibre or a slitlet cut in a mask at the telescope focus). in contrast, IFS obtains complete, spatially resolved coverage over a small field. The MOS targets are generally faint objects at the limits of detection such as primeval galaxies. As telescopes get bigger it is apparent that these actually have blobby and confused structure that requires the observer to carefully select which parts of the field will be passed through to the spectrographs since it is not feasible to carpet the whole field with a single huge IFU. DFS is an instrument paradigm that allows the observer to select arbitrary combinations of contiguous and isolated regions of the sky to maximise observing efficiency and scientific return. Various technologies are under development including robotic switch-yards and photonic optical switches.|$|E
50|$|Honda was {{the seventh}} action figure {{made in a}} series for the 1993 G.I. Joe Street Fighter line. The figure is {{actually}} unique compared to the others: no parts were reused to make it, requiring a unique mold needing to be made due to his size. The character's legs could be squeezed together to have the upper body bend down in a headbutt motion, and was jointed {{to allow for the}} Hundred Hand Slap move. The toy was discontinued in 1994. A variant of it was later released in 1994 for the Street Fighter live action movie line of toys by Hasbro, a tweaked version of the previous action figure (complicating a bit, as the toy resembled the actor in the film very little and more the video game counterpart). Like all toys in the line, both came with attachable weapon pieces despite the fact the character did not use any in the game or film. Another action figure was released much later on as part of SOTA's Revolutions Series 1. The figure featured a <b>positionable</b> waist, arms, and legs, and an alternate head for different facial expression. A limited edition version of the figure using Honda's default Street Fighter II Turbo colors was released {{in the second quarter of}} 2008, with only 504 units produced.|$|E
50|$|Safety back-up device, this is {{the most}} {{important}} tool as it a provides a redundancy should an ascender, descender, working rope or anchor fail. It is attached to the safety (second rope) and designed to be kept as high as possible to reduce the distance fallen in the event of a fall. The safety devices usually relies on friction transferred to the safety rope by means of a cam. The Petzl Shunt, a recreational climbing device, has been used successfully for many years for the safety back-up because it is <b>positionable</b> by the user, allowing it to be high above them at the work site and thus providing optimum protection. Concern over potential misuse and lack of user instructions or support for its use by Petzl has led to the development of other devices, including the Petzl ASAP, the KONG Back-Up, the DMM Buddy Catch, the SafeTec Duck-R. Unlike traditional devices that rely on friction to absorb shock the ASAP relies on a toothed wheel and an rip-stitch single use shock pack and although has the advantage of self trailing it tends to creep below the user. The Duck-R is a beefed-up stainless steel Shunt-shaped device designed specifically for use in rope access. All devices are connected back to the harness by means of a lanyard, otherwise known as a cow's tail, and fastened to the lanyard by a screwgate carabiner.|$|E

The LB9 Tuned Port Injection (TPI) 305 was released, using a tuned runner design. The LB9 produced 210 hp, which brought it suitable attention from buyers despite being unavailable with a manual transmission. The [...] "Turbo Bulge" [...] hood was discontinued {{in favor of a}} new flat hood with twin louvered vents or [...] "nostrils" [...] that were functional, with heat exhaust vents on the rear edges. The Trans Am also received a restyled nose, integral fog lights, and newly redesigned ground effects. It utilized new [...] "low density" [...] taillight lenses with a grid-style pattern rather than the [...] "louvered" [...] pattern in use since 1981. The Trans Am came standard with the [...] "High Tech" [...] 15-inch concave aluminum wheels from the previous year, but it was also now available with the a version of the 15th Anniversary's WS6 suspension and its [...] "Aero Tech" [...] 16-inch aluminum wheels, but in finished Natural Silver. A Borg-Warner 9-bolt differential was made available for the first time, and was said to be stronger than the standard corporate 10 bolt axle. Further attempts to put the Trans Am into higher regard included overhead console from the Camaro lineup, which included several manually adjusted reminder wheels, a <b>positionable</b> map light, a removable flashlight with [...] "FIREBIRD" [...] script, and a small pocket for a garage door opener or sunglasses. The standard rear spoiler from previous years was still standard, but an optional wrap-around [...] "Aero Spoiler" [...] was now available in black and gave the car a new more modern look, (it is unique for 1985 & 1986 as it had a texture). The Trans Am drag coefficient was measured at 0.32 but was as low as 0.29 with the standard Aero wheels instead of the High-Tech turbo aluminum wheels. At the time, it was the most aerodynamically efficient car GM ever produced.|$|E

40|$|This {{invention}} relates {{generally to}} electrophoresis devices and more particularly to a moving wall, continuous flow device in which an electrophoresis chamber is angularly <b>positionable</b> {{with respect to the}} direction of moving belt walls. A frame with an electrophoresis chamber is rotatably supported between two synchronously driven belt walls. This allows the chamber to be angularly <b>positionable</b> with respect to the direction of belt travel, which compensates for electroosmotic flow within the electrophoresis chamber. Injection of a buffer solution via an opening and a homogenous sample stream via another opening is performed {{at the end of a}} chamber, and collection of buffer and the fractionated species particles is done by a conventional collection array at an opposite end of the chamber. Belts are driven at a rate which exactly matches the flow of buffer and sample through the chamber, which entrains the buffer to behave as a rigid electrophoretic medium, eliminating flow distortions (Poiseuille effect). Additionally, belt material for each belt is stored at one end of the device and is taken up by drive wheels at an opposite end. The novelty of this invention particularly lies in the electrophoresis chamber being angularly <b>positionable</b> between two moving belt walls in order to compensate for electroosmotic flow. Additionally, new belt material is continuously exposed within the chamber, minimizing flow distortion due to contamination of the belt material by the sample...|$|E
