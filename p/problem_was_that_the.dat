5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Franck {{moved to}} the United States, where he had {{accepted}} a professorship at Johns Hopkins University. The laboratory there was poorly equipped compared {{to the one in}} Göttingen, but he received $10,000 for equipment from the Rockefeller Foundation. A more intractable <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> university had no money to hire skilled staff. Franck was concerned about his family members remaining in Germany, and needed money to help them emigrate. He therefore accepted an offer from the University of Chicago, where his work on photosynthesis had attracted interest, in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Production at Site S ceased in late 1945 due to {{the cold}} weather. All work was then done at Salt Wells. The plant was {{completed}} in January 1946, and all equipment was installed and working by May 1946. Work was initially dogged by an unacceptably large number of defects {{in the form of}} cracks or imperfections in the explosive blocks. The core of the <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> techniques used at Los Alamos did not scale to a production site, so different methods were required. Special instrumentation was devised by Caltech's Ira Bowen to assess the quality of the explosive blocks.|$|E

5|$|The Soviets {{bought an}} example of, and plans for, the {{machinery}} of the later Duca d'Aosta-class cruisers and had some difficulty in adapting the smaller hull for the larger and more-powerful machinery, {{so much so that}} it delayed the start of construction. Another <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Italian design had to be adapted to use the Soviet preference for a mix of longitudinal framing for the hull framing amidships and transverse framing for the ends, while also reinforcing the hull structure to withstand the more-severe weather conditions that the Soviets commonly encountered.|$|E
5|$|The {{planetary}} {{model of}} the atom had two significant shortcomings. The first is that, unlike planets orbiting a sun, electrons are charged particles. An accelerating electric charge is known to emit electromagnetic waves according to the Larmor formula in classical electromagnetism. An orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in {{a small fraction of}} a second. The second <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> planetary model could not explain the highly peaked emission and absorption spectra of atoms that were observed.|$|E
5|$|The second rule of privity, that a {{third party}} cannot claim {{benefits}} from a contract, was widely criticised by academics, members of the judiciary and legal professionals. One <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rule made no exceptions for cases where it was obviously intended for the third party to claim a benefit, such as in Beswick v Beswick, where an uncle gave his nephew a business, {{on the condition that}} the nephew would pay the uncle a certain amount per week, and in the event of the uncle's death, give a similar amount to his widow.|$|E

5|$|The state {{constitution}} had come under considerable criticism {{beginning in the}} 1840s because it allowed most government positions to be filled by appointment. The problem with this method of filling positions did not manifest itself until {{the advent of the}} state's political parties. Once in power, a party could stack the government with its own members, making it difficult for the minority to regain power. Another <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> authority for many trivial issues were not delegated to other authorities. For example, if a man was to divorce his wife, the divorce bill had to be approved by the General Assembly before he or she could legally remarry.|$|E
5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips {{to move out of the}} line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold on the underside of the weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E
5|$|Gunnery {{developments}} in the late 1890s and the early 1900s, led in the United Kingdom by Percy Scott and in the United States by William Sims, were already pushing expected battle ranges out to an unprecedented , a distance great enough to force gunners {{to wait for the}} shells to arrive before applying corrections for the next salvo. A related <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shell splashes from the more numerous smaller weapons tended to obscure the splashes from the bigger guns. Either the smaller-calibre guns would have to hold their fire to wait for the slower-firing heavies, losing the advantage of their faster rate of fire, or it would be uncertain whether a splash was due to a heavy or a light gun, making ranging and aiming unreliable. Another problem was that longer-range torpedoes were expected to soon be in service and these would discourage ships from closing to ranges where the smaller guns' faster rate of fire would become preeminent. Keeping the range open generally negated the threat from torpedoes and further reinforced the need for heavy guns of a uniform calibre.|$|E
50|$|From {{a postal}} point of view, <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> postage stamp stocks are in Moroni, on Grande Comore, {{and they were}} quickly overprinted to strike out all {{reference}} to French sovereignty.|$|R
50|$|A third <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{prescriber}} {{does not}} know whether the relevant subjects consider <b>the</b> effects <b>that</b> they experience to be desirable or undesirable until some time after the drugs have been administered.|$|R
50|$|Another common <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> plastic of the {{three-way}} valve {{is unable to}} withstand the heat and goes brittle. This may result in leakage, coffee brewed at too low pressure or not at all, or short-circuits.|$|R
5|$|Sailor Brian Hancock {{encountered}} Hurricane Lili {{during the}} Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalmádena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots {{along the same}} path as the race fleet and was starting to pick off the slower boats. Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we would get to the Bahamas before the storm did, but the <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to be exact. We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all. It helps {{to be a little}} naive and dumb but that’s how you are when you are in your 20’s.|$|E
5|$|The British public {{first saw}} the Spitfire at the RAF Hendon air-display on Saturday 27 June 1936. Although {{full-scale}} production was supposed to begin immediately, there were numerous problems {{that could not be}} overcome for some time, and the first production Spitfire, K9787, did not roll off the Woolston, Southampton assembly line until mid-1938. The first and most immediate <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> main Supermarine factory at Woolston was already working at full capacity fulfilling orders for Walrus and Stranraer flying boats. Although outside contractors were supposed to be involved in manufacturing many important Spitfire components, especially the wings, Vickers-Armstrong (the parent company) was reluctant to see the Spitfire being manufactured by outside concerns, and was slow to release the necessary blueprints and subcomponents. As a result of the delays in getting the Spitfire into full production, the Air Ministry put forward a plan that production of the Spitfire be stopped after the initial order for 310, after which Supermarine would build Bristol Beaufighters. The managements of Supermarine and Vickers were able to convince the Air Ministry that the problems could be overcome, and further orders were placed for 200 Spitfires on 24 March 1938. The two orders covered the K, L and N prefix serial numbers.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of Kronan began in October 1665, and the hull was launched on 31 July 1668. The English shipwright Francis Sheldon frequently came {{in conflict with}} the admiralty over the project. The navy administrators complained that he was unduly delaying the project and was spending too much time on his own private business ventures. The most aggravating contention was Sheldon's extensive and lucrative export of mast timber to England. Sheldon in turn complained about constant delays on the navy's part and lack of funds. When the ship was launched, the slipway turned out to be too small and the rear section of the keel broke off during the launching. The admiralty demanded an explanation, but Sheldon's reply was that the damage was easily mended and that the <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> timber had been left to dry too long. The conflict between the Admiralty and Sheldon dragged on for several years and caused constant delays. The sculptures were finished in 1669, but the rigging, tackling, and arming was drawn out a further three years, to 1672. The first occasion that the ship sailed was during the celebrations of Charles XI's accession as monarch in December 1672.|$|E
50|$|But the Firmware {{now only}} {{allows you to}} record FullHD at 120 fps.Another <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Slow-Motion Videos aren't good for editing, because the output-file isn't saved in real-time, because the sensor-output isn't {{the same as the}} output video file.|$|R
25|$|Some argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> root <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{military}} <b>is</b> self-selecting, {{rendering the}} culture a self-perpetuating one. Solutions {{such as the}} reinstatement of the draft and a European-style national service obligation have been offered. but none appear to have made any progress toward adoption.|$|R
50|$|A further <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{material}} conditional <b>is</b> such <b>that</b> (P AND ¬P) → Q, {{regardless of}} what Q is taken to mean. <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> a contradiction implies <b>that</b> absolutely everything <b>is</b> true. Logicians concerned with this have tried to develop paraconsistent logics.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} give the LM {{national}} exposure, Hall decided to stand for the Australian Senate at the 1974 federal election. Another objective was to allow Millhouse and Cameron to become more prominent at state level and dispel the established perception of the LM as a Hall party. The move was a risk as failure would have left the LM's main drawcard {{out of the spotlight}} entirely until a state election which was not due for another two years, but Hall said the party had no future unless it could gain national stature. Another possible <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> media could have lost interest in the LM at a state level regardless of whether Hall won a senate position. The 1975 federal election followed a double dissolution (meaning that all Senate seats, rather than half, were up for election and thus a candidate needed only roughly half of the normal percentage to gain election; Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was hoping to attain a majority in the Senate), and all ten South Australian Senate seats were contested. The battle between the LCL and the LM was not seen as {{a large part of the}} national campaign, as South Australia was only a small part of the nation and most of the marginal seats that would determine the outcome were in other states. The LM gained 9.9 per cent of the vote in the Senate and Hall was elected in his own right, without the assistance of preferences. In the House of Representatives, the LM gained 8.4 per cent of the vote across the 12 South Australian seats, ranging from a high of 18 per cent in metropolitan Boothby to 1.6 per cent in rural Angas. Fortunately for Hall and the LM, the senate election resulted in Labor and the Liberal-Country Party coalition holding 29 seats each, and Hall was one of two crossbenchers who held the balance of power. The media made much of Hall's position as a powerbroker at federal level, and the Liberals responded to him in a hostile manner; for his part, Hall continued to persistently attack them as outmoded and lambasted them over the matter of electoral reform.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{amplification}} {{system used}} in Nova and other high-power lasers of its era was limited {{in terms of}} power density and pulse length. One <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> amplifier glass responded {{over a period of}} time, not instantaneously, and very short pulses would not be strongly amplified. Another <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> high power densities led to the same sorts of self-focusing problems that had caused problems in earlier designs, but at such a magnitude that even measures like spatial filtering would not be enough, in fact the power densities were high enough to cause filaments to form in air.|$|E
25|$|The {{propulsion}} system {{consists of a}} fuel tank and a separate tank for the Red fuming nitric acid oxidiser. One <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> missile required fuelling just before flight, and not many airfields had the appropriate facilities. Range is given variously as 80–95km or 120km.|$|E
50|$|Although {{most people}} do have an {{intuitive}} understanding of what a person is, the definition has much room for improvement. <b>The</b> first <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> definition <b>is</b> circular.

50|$|A second <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> same effect, such as immunosuppression, may be {{desirable}} for a subject with an autoimmune disorder, but be undesirable for most other subjects. Thus, {{in the first}} case, the effect would be a placebo, and in the second, a nocebo.|$|R
30|$|What {{appears to}} be a {{promising}} answer to this kind of <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> SP system <b>is</b> designed to search for optimal solutions and is not unduly disturbed by errors of omission, commission and substitution. There is more on this topic in Sections 4.1 and 5.6.|$|R
25|$|Retaining {{literacy}} {{was as much}} {{a problem}} as acquiring it, particularly among the rural population. Literacy rates declined between 1966 and 1976.

25|$|When it was {{discovered}} in 1937 that the RAF was planning eight-gun batteries for its new Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire fighters, {{it was decided that}} the Bf 109 should be more heavily armed. The <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only place available to mount additional guns was in the wings. Only one spot was available in each wing, between the wheel well and slats, with room for only one gun, either a 7.92mm MG 17 machine gun, or a 20mm MG FF or MG FF/M cannon.|$|E
25|$|In black-figure vase painting, the pre-drawn {{outlines}} {{were a part}} of the figure. In red-figure vases, {{the outline}} would, after firing, form part of the black background. This led to vases with very thin figures early on. A further <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> black background did not permit the depiction of space in any depth, so that spatial perspective was almost never attempted. Nonetheless, the advantages outnumbered the disadvantages. The depiction of muscles and other anatomical details clearly illustrates the development of the style.|$|E
30|$|Another <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{check for}} a message {{exchange}} is also only executed if a new contact comes up. This further decreases the utilization of stable connections and affects also protocols that do not use a utility-based routing scheme. It is therefore another crucial effect.|$|R
30|$|Background {{noise is}} an {{unavoidable}} factor in speech processing.

50|$|Another model stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> planets {{might have}} formed from a {{fallback}} disk from the supernova remnant. <b>The</b> main <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> resulting pulsar {{would be a}} radio pulsar, {{not the kind of}} pulsar <b>that</b> PSR B1257+12 <b>is.</b> Thus, it <b>is</b> unlikely <b>that</b> this <b>was</b> how <b>the</b> formed.|$|R
