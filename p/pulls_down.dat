25|$|These are {{generally}} used in conditions of low visibility where a diver {{is connected to}} another person, either another diver or a tender on the surface, by a rope.

The diver <b>pulls</b> <b>down</b> on the buoy line to make the buoy bob in an equivalent pattern to the rope signal. Effective rope signals need a free line without much slack, Before attempting a rope signal, the slack must be taken up, and the line pulled firmly. Most signals are acknowledged by returning the same signal, which shows that it was received accurately. Persistent failure to acknowledge may indicate a serious problem and should be resolved as a matter of urgency. There are several systems in use, and it is necessary to have agreement between diver and tender before the dive.|$|E

500|$|The sixth {{aspect of}} the Six Paths, the , {{provides}} five known abilities based on gravitation. The first is , which uses the user's body as the epicenter of gravity and pushes away any technique of any force through gravity manipulation, though it has a five-second limit after each use. It {{can be used for}} a large-scale effect by placing a titanic gravity over a large area and obliterating it; in this case {{it can be used to}} destroy an entire village – at the cost of shortening the user's lifespan and being unable to use it for several minutes. The second is , a companion of Almighty Push which also manipulates gravity, but pulls all things towards a center point. It also has the same five-second limit, though it is unknown whether it can be used for a large-scale effect. The third ability is , which musters a large amount of user's chakra to release a small black orb of energy with intense gravitational pull, enough to uproot trees and destroy mountains, that compacts any thing caught in its pull into an extraterrestrial body that serves to encase whoever is trapped within it. Hagoromo used this technique to seal the Gedo Statue with the moon created as a result. The fourth ability is , which <b>pulls</b> <b>down</b> double meteors to the Earth.

The user stands over the squat toilet facing the hood and <b>pulls</b> <b>down</b> (up in the case of skirts) their trousers and underwear to the knees.

Beavis has a penchant for making off-beat sound effects to suit the occasion. Whenever he sees something that is sexually arousing, he imitates a spring (onomatopoetically saying [...] "Boi-oi-oi-oi-oiiing!!!") indicating a quick erection. He sometimes makes a Bronx cheer by puckering his lips. He occasionally does impersonations, such as of Principal McVicker ("Speech Therapy"), motivational speaker Mr. Manners/Mr. Candy ("Manners Suck/Candy Sale"), and Woody Woodpecker ("Top O' the Mountain"). During one episode, Beavis conspicuously reveals that he is sometimes prone to getting erections in the company of other men. A special ability of his is speaking backwards, as seen in [...] "Vidiots", while the duo review a music video; however, he forgets how to do so {{by the end of the}} video. Beavis also displays a predilection for defecating and things that are related to it, and in a high-pitched tone will often enthusiastically utter the word [...] "poop", or will say the word [...] "plop" [...] to indicate a bowel movement. He frequently <b>pulls</b> <b>down</b> his pants during music video reviews. He also took Kaopectate once after hearing it is for diarrhea under the misconception he would get diarrhea; he was only soothed by an enormous bowel movement which he saved in his dresser drawer, much to Butt-Head's disgust. Beavis sometimes displays examples of the idiot savant when slapped hard by Butt-Head or when attempting to pass out by holding his breath and blowing into his thumb, in which cases Beavis starts to make intellectual statements usually regarding the music videos he is viewing.|$|E
