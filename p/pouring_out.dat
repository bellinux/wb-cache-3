5|$|Another fountain, {{sometimes}} {{also known}} as the Wignacourt Fountain, was built close to Porta Reale in Valletta attached to the Ferreria building (demolished). It consists of a lion's head <b>pouring</b> <b>out</b> water into a stone basin, topped by the coat of arms of Wignacourt and the Order and surrounded by a garland of flowers and interlocking seashells. Below the coats of arms is a radiating sun with the inscription Omnibus Idem (meaning the same to all), indicating that the water was freely available to everyone.|$|E

Silva closed {{the distance and}} secured a Muay Thai clinch. From here, Silva landed approximately 5 knee strikes to Jackson's head, causing him {{to fall into the}} ropes, unconscious and with blood <b>pouring</b> <b>out</b> of his face. Silva was declared the winner by Knockout at 3:26 of the 2nd round to remain the Pride Middleweight Champion.|$|E
5|$|Along {{the east}} coast of Florida, the most severe damage was {{reported}} from Miami to Fort Pierce, particularly in Palm Beach County. In West Palm Beach, one of the most severely affected coastal cities, a total of 1,711houses were destroyed and 6,369 others suffered damage, which left about 2,100families homeless. Additionally, the hurricane demolished 268businesses and affected 490others. There were four deaths, and severe damage totaling just under $13.8 million (1928USD). At Palm Beach, which had many houses owned by wealthy individuals, approximately 1,500houses and 500businesses were destroyed. Damage totaled around $10million. Inland, many communities on the southern and eastern shores of Lake Okeechobee, such as the cities of Belle Glade, Canal Point, Chosen, Miami Locks (today Lake Harbor), Pahokee, and South Bay, were ravaged by flooding after storm surge resulted in water <b>pouring</b> <b>out</b> of the shallow lake over the small dikes. Numerous structures were swept away or destroyed, and at least 2,500people drowned. Overall, the hurricane left at least $25million in damage.|$|E

5|$|Lonely and needing {{someone to}} care for his {{children}} and help with the sewing and other chores, Mala takes the young girl Iva as his new wife. But Mala still longs for Aba, and their relationship is a cold one. The Eskimos go hunting caribou by stampeding the animals into a lake and then hunting them with bow and arrow and spears from boats. Mala is haunted by Aba's death, and after <b>pouring</b> <b>out</b> his grief through dance and prayer he changes his name to Kripik. Kripik's attitude toward Iva softens dramatically, and they make love. The hunter whom Mala welcomed to the village the previous year returns to his village, and gives Kripik his wife in gratitude. The woman is {{more than happy to}} live with Mala, and Mala makes love to her as well.|$|E

25|$|The {{resulting}} outflow wind {{is more or}} {{less the}} opposite of British Columbia / Pacific Northwest Chinook. These are called a squamish in certain areas, rooted in the direction of such winds coming down out of Howe Sound, home to the Squamish people, and in Alaska are called a williwaw. They consist of cold airstreams from the continental air mass <b>pouring</b> <b>out</b> of the interior plateau via certain river valleys and canyons penetrating the Coast Mountains towards the coast.|$|E
25|$|Port Phillip Bay formed {{between the}} end of the last Ice Age around 8000 BCE and around 6000 BCE, when the sea-level rose to drown what was then the lower reaches of the Yarra River, vast river plains, {{wetlands}} and lakes. The Yarra and other tributaries flowed down what is now the middle of the bay, formed a lake in the southern reaches of the bay, dammed by The Heads, subsequently <b>pouring</b> <b>out</b> into Bass Strait.|$|E
25|$|What {{women might}} have gained from {{cultivating}} devotions {{such as these}} has recently become a contentious matter. According to one school of thought, here lay an empowerment of women, both because the period’s cultural description of their bodies was preoccupied with blood and lactation and with nourishing in ways that implied a convergence between women and the salvific life-giving body of Christ (<b>pouring</b> <b>out</b> Eucharistic blood on the cross), and secondly because women were so constituted by their culture as subjected, powerless, suffering beings that they could ‘represent’ with particular force the suffering humanity of Christ.|$|E

25|$|According to Peake's Commentary on the Bible, Biblical {{scholars}} {{regard the}} requirement of Kohanim washing their hands prior to the Priestly Blessing {{as an example of}} the taboo against the profane making contact with the sacred, and similar practices are present in other religions of the period and region. The Jewish Encyclopedia relates that according to Herodotus the Egyptian priests were required to wash themselves twice a day and twice a night in cold water, and according to Hesiod the Greeks were forbidden from <b>pouring</b> <b>out</b> the black wine to any deity in the morning, unless they had first washed their hands.|$|E
25|$|The Mackenzie River delta was a {{focus of}} ground and air surveys as early as 1957, and geologists drew {{comparisons}} then to the Mississippi and Niger Deltas, speculating that the Mackenzie could prove as prolific. For millions of years sediments had been <b>pouring</b> <b>out</b> of {{the mouth of the}} Mackenzie, creating tremendous banks of sand and shale – laminates of sedimentary rock warped into promising geological structures. Drilling began in the Mackenzie Delta-Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula in 1962, and accelerated during the early 1970s. The mouth of the Mackenzie River was not a Prudhoe Bay, but it did contain large gas fields.|$|E
25|$|I {{just had}} to lay it down, more or less: first track... second track – you know, really fast working on that. And all the guitar overdubs on Presence were done in one night. But I didn't think I {{would be able to}} do it in one night, I thought I'd have to do it across maybe three {{different}} nights to get the individual sections. Everything sort of crystallised and you'll notice everything was just <b>pouring</b> <b>out.</b> I was very happy with the guitar playing on that whole album, you know as far as the maturity of playing goes.|$|E

25|$|One Taíno oral {{tradition}} {{explains that the}} Sun and Moon come out of caves. Another story tells of people who once lived in caves and only came out at night, because {{it was believed that}} the Sun would transform them. The Taíno believed they were descended from the union of Deminán Caracaracol and a female turtle. The origin of the oceans is described in the story of a huge flood, which occurred when a father murdered his son (who was about to murder the father). The father put the son's bones into a gourd or calabash. When the bones turned into fish, the gourd broke, and all the water of the world came <b>pouring</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{concentration}} of these sacrifices, the main offering given by private individuals, {{at a single}} sanctuary evidently resulted in such large numbers of offers that the space {{on the north side}} of the altar, where the animals were killed in the other types of sacrifices, became cramped, hence the specific permit for sacrifice-of-peace offerings were to be killed anywhere within the sanctuary courtyard. How exactly a portion of the resulting meat was given to God appears to have varied; though the regulations of the Priestly Code point to God's portion being burnt on the altar, Gideon is described in the Book of Judges, a text which textual scholars believe has a much earlier date than Leviticus, as <b>pouring</b> <b>out</b> broth, made from the meat of the sacrifice, as a libation.|$|E
25|$|The Newfoundland School Society (N.S.S) was {{established}} on June 30, 1823 by a merchant named Samuel Codner. Codner {{first came to}} Newfoundland in 1788 and periodically traveled back to England where he {{was influenced by the}} Evangelical Revival occurring there during this time. He was inspired to help Christians in neglected British colonies by the Premier of England, Lord Liverpool in 1821. Knowing the dire conditions in Newfoundland, he formed The Society for Educating the Poor of Newfoundland which had its first annual meeting at the London Coffee House on July 13, 1824. It was the ability of the N.S.S. to deal with the difficult conditions in Newfoundland that led to their great success on the Island. The first N.S.S. school was set up in St. John's in 1823 and within two years, the demand spread rapidly to rural Newfoundland where petitions and applications for schools began <b>pouring</b> <b>out.</b> By 1825, five schoolmasters had been sent between St. John’s, Quidi Vidi, Harbour Grace, Carbonear, and Petty Harbour. Within just ten years, 43 N.S.S. schools had been established on the Island, with an enrolment of approximately 6945 children in daily schools and 4714 in Sunday schools. The N.S.S. began to dissipate in the late 19th century when Newfoundland Legislature established an Education Board and set up Board Schools across the Island, and especially after the Education Act of 1891. In 1923, what still existed as the N.S.S. merged into a denominational school system known as the Church of England schools.|$|E
