To provide polymer surfaces with special functionalities {{it is necessary to}} treat them with according precursors in plasma. In this work polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) were exposed to bromine containing (bromoform, allylbromide, tert-butylbromide) plasmas. Surpisingly, the bromination appeared as high selective and formed high dense C-Br groups at the polyolefin surface. Halogen containing plasmas like tetrafluormethane, fluoroform, chloroform, bromoform and diiodinemethane were compared with regard to their selectivity, yield as well as ionisation potential and electron temperature of the corresponding plasma. It was also analysed if the halogens are bonded as C-X or C-CXn-fragments onto the surface. Moreover, the post-plasma oxidation stability was also investigated. Subsequently the brominated <b>polyolefine</b> surfaces were allowed to react with different organic compounds. The aim was to demonstrate the universality of the C-Br group for attaching of any OH and NH 2 functional group containing molecule. Terminal alcohol, glycols and amines are used.

Investigations of the mechanical properties using tensile tests resulted in a significant enhancement of Young's modulus up to 372 % and nearly doubling of tensile strength at 5. 0 wt%. Even if the hotmelt material is highly elastic compared to typical thermoplastic matrices, the melt mixing resulted in suitable CNT dispersion. The melt viscosity increased with CNT loading, however near the observed electrical percolation threshold the processability was not notably reduced. Most important, next to conductivity at low CNT loadings, also a significant enhancement in the shear strength of bonded joints of AlMg 3 up to values of 250 % of the pure hotmelt could be obtained.

40|$|Polymer nanocomposites are in {{the focus}} of global {{academic}} research of recent years due to enormous possibilities to obtain unique original materials with substantially improved exploitation properties, necessary for applications in energetics, electrotechnics, electronics, structural engineering and other relevant fields of national economy [1 - 5]. Unique properties of the nanocomposites are generally imparted by modifying the matrix polymer by addition of nanostructured fillers of various geometries. Carbon allotropes, among them fullerenes, nanotubes and graphene, represent the most versatile class of nanostructured fillers. Introduction of carbon allotropes within polymer matrix is burdened due {{to the absence of}} functional groups {{on the surface of the}} nanofiller. Consequently, successful introduction of carbon nanofillers within polymer matrix requires some surface modification of the nanofiller, in spite of the fact that this can lead to certain impairment of it unique electrical, thermal and mechanical properties. Functionalization of carbon allotropes with carboxyl, hydroxyl, acyl, amine and amide functional groups are most widely known [6 - 8]. The current research considers modification of thermoplastic polyolefines and <b>polyolefine</b> copolymers by means of functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MW-CNTs). Covalent and non-covalent functionalization routes (including carboxylation and treatment with ionic liquids) of MW-CNTs have been considered. The amount of neat and functionalized MW-CNTs in a polymer matrix has been changed in a rather broad range from 0, 5 to 10, 0 wt. %. The effectiveness of direct melting and masterbatch approaches has been compared for obtaining the nanocomposites with desirable dispersion of the nanofillers within the thermoplastic <b>polyolefine</b> matrix. MWCNTs dispersion patterns within the polymer matrix have been studied by means electron microscopy. Electric and mechanical performance of the nanocomposites has been characterized by means of broadband dielectric spectroscopy as well as dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. The factors of external environment (UV irradiation, temperature, moisture content) on the electrical and mechanical properties of the aforementioned polymer nanocomposites have been also evaluated. Especial attention has been paid to evaluation of reinforcing efficiency of MW-CNTs on the accelerated weathering impaired polymer nanocomposites, the aspect investigated relatively scarcely in the scientific literature. Results of the investigation testify that proper choice of the manufacturing technology allows considerably improve distribution of the nanofiller within the thermoplastic polymer matrix. Besides it has been observed that by increasing the nanofiller content within the polymer matrix elastic and dielectric properties of the investigated nanocomposites can be considerably increased.

Whereas incorporation in <b>polyolefine</b> hot melts was done using melt mixing the addition into epoxies was performed by mixing in the hardener or the resin.

The important role of the underlying molecular entanglement network in this approach is reflected by the strain hardening behaviour which is {{shown to be a}} robust measure for predicting slow crack growth performance. The polymer network response explains the experimentally observed presence of two Brittle–Ductile transitions, one at low temperature or high strain rates, linked with chain scission which dominates crazing, the other at elevated temperatures or low strain rates which involves disentanglement crazing. The relation between these two Brittle–Ductile transitions and the major transition temperatures for molecular mobility such as the glass transition and the crystal α relaxation temperature are discussed.

When stimulated by current, though both patterned and un-patterned neurons presented regular spiking, the dynamics and strength of the response were different. The un-patterned neurons exhibited a monotonically increasing firing frequency in response to injected current, while the patterned neurons first exhibited frequency increase and then a slow decrease.

The compositional changes in solvent extractable radiolysis products of each packaging material were quantified. In most cases the radiolysis products formed could be identified using GC/MS. The <b>polyolefine</b> materials (PE and PP) showed an increase of low volatile compounds after irradiation due to an oxidative decomposition of the polymer and typical polymer substances like oligomers and additives.

In this work for reinforcing of HDPE we approbated one of the waste product-plywood sanding dust (PSD), which contain wood fibres fractions with different length (l). The main fraction (68 %) are fibres with length l= 0. 25 - 0. 5 mm. Our previous studies [2] showed that PSD is promising filler for PP reinforcing.

The most useful from wide selection of polyolefines are polypropylenes, but timber industry waste materials comprising lignocellulose fibres are often used as reinforcement of WPC [3 – 12]. Plywood industry is not an exception – part of waste materials (by-products) are used for heat energy, i. e. burned. In this work we have approbated reinforcing of polypropylene (PP) with one of the plywood industry by-products, such as birch plywood sawdust (PSWD),which containswood fibre fractions with different length [13]. The main fraction (50 %) includes fibres with length l = 0. 5 − 1 mm. Our previous study [13] has confirmed that PSWD is a promising filler for PP reinforcing. Addition of PSWD up to 40 – 50 wt. % has increased WPC tensile and flexural modulus, but decreased deformation ability of PP matrix, impact strength, water resistance and fluidity of composite melts. It was shown [13] that modification of the composites with interfacial modifier – coupling agent maleated polypropylene (MAPP content up to 5 – 7 wt. %) considerably improved all the abovementioned properties.

Nowadays the market of fillers for <b>polyolefines</b> is dominated by calcium carbonate which is one of the most widely used particulate fillers for polymer applications due to it’s low cost, ready availability and useful properties. However, even if CaCO₃ enhances the Young’s modulus it is often reported that decreases impact strength. Thus, researchers are studying to improve the mechanical properties of polymers toughened with CaCO₃ nanoparticles so they are expected to be very desirable materials. In fact, previous results from our work in collaboration with Solvay Advanced Functional Minerals have shown that a dry-coated PCC substantially enhances impact in both homopolymer and copolymer iPP and so this result encourage us to continue these studies and to extend its use on both PP and PS. So we studied the possibility to tough some <b>polyolefines</b> mixed with different type of CaCO₃ nanoparticles (PCC) and the mechanism that explains their mechanical deformation.
