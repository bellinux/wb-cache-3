50|$|The {{earliest}} bottles or vessels {{were made}} by ancient man. Ingredients were melted to make glass and then clay forms were dipped into the molten liquid. When the glass cooled off, the clay was chipped out of the inside leaving just the hollow glass vessel. This glass was very thin as the fire was not as hot as modern day furnaces. The blowpipe was invented around 1 B.C. This allowed molten glass to be gathered {{on the end of}} the <b>blow</b> pipe <b>and</b> <b>blown</b> into the other end to create a hollow vessel. Eventually, the use of a mold was introduced, followed by the invention of a semi-automatic machine called the <b>Press</b> <b>and</b> <b>Blow.</b> In 1904 Michael Owens invented the automatic bottle machine.|$|R
50|$|From 1916 to 1924, {{competition}} arose between Hartford and Owens over gob feeder technology, including patent interferences {{and extensive}} litigation. In 1924, Hartford and Owens entered into an agreement giving Hartford an exclusive license on Owens's patents relating to feeders and forming machines, and giving Owens {{the right to}} use the Hartford patents for the manufacture of glassware. Owens was not to sell or license any of its gob feeding machinery and was not to engage in the <b>pressed</b> <b>and</b> <b>blown</b> glass fields that had previously been reserved to Corning. Owens received one-half of Hartford's licensing income over and above $600,000 per year. It was understood that Owens would be the only company operating with suction machinery. Hartford and Owen then proceeded to buy up the other patents in the glassware industry. Hazel-Atlas resisted Hartford and Owen until 1932, when Hartford, Owens and Hazel-Atlas entered into a series of agreements settling patent infringement litigation. Hartford granted to Hazel-Atlas {{the right to use}} Hartford patents and inventions, but Hazel-Atlas was not to license or sell such patents and inventions to anyone. Hazel-Atlas granted to Hartford the right to use Hazel-Atlas patents and inventions. Hazel-Atlas agreed to pay Hartford royalties {{for the use of the}} Hartford inventions. Hazel-Atlas was excluded from the <b>pressed</b> <b>and</b> <b>blown</b> field, which had previously been reserved to Corning. Hazel-Atlas and Owens were each to receive one-third of Hartford's licensing income over and above $850,000 per year. At this point the remaining opposition to Hartford collapsed and substantially everyone in the industry took a license from Hartford. By December 1939 when the Government brought this antitrust suit, only four small companies engaged in the manufacture of glassware were not under license and lease from Hartford; they represented less than 4% of the total production in the industry; and Hartford was suing three of them for patent infringement.|$|R

40|$|The {{narrow neck}} <b>press</b> <b>and</b> <b>blow</b> (NNPB) process was {{introduced}} to gain better control over glass distribution in the container. The improved control over glass distribution has enabled significant reduction in glass weight of up to 33 % without adversely affecting the mechanical performance of the container. A key component in the above process is the plunger, used to form the cavity in the parison during the forming stage. The function of the plunger is to evenly distribute the glass within the blank mould cavity and to aid the removal of thermal energy from the internal surface of the parison. Whilst there has been considerable attention given {{to the requirements of}} the glass, e. g. viscosity, gob weight, temperature and homogeneity, there has been little attention given to the plunger material, cooling system design and the plunger operating environment.

Preliminary work using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling that has been carried out by others (6, 7, 8, 9) shows that recirculation and choking of the airflow pattern within the bore of the plunger cooling tube system corresponds to the areas of poor cooling. Thus producing areas of ineffective heat extraction from the parison by the air flowing through the plunger cooling tube system. The current work addresses the above problem by examining the cooling tube design using CFD modelling and analyses the heat transfer from the parison to the plunger. These results should prove to be of immense value to designers and manufacturers associated with the glass production industry...|$|R

50|$|The suction {{machinery}} was {{the first}} fully automatic glassware manufacturing machinery produced. Owens {{put it on the}} market in 1903 and controlled the patents on it. Owens licensed the use of the machinery to different manufacturers for only specific kinds of glassware, and thus set a market-division pattern that was later followed by Hartford in the licensing and leasing of its automatic feeders. For example, Owens licensed Ball Brothers to make fruit jars and licensed Hazel-Atlas to manufacture wide mouth glassware. After Hartford developed the gob feeder, which largely superseded the suction machinery, Hartford licensed and leased gob feeders in much the same manner that Owens had licensed its suction machines, that is, by issuing licenses to make only specific kinds of glassware. After patent interferences developed between Hartford and Empire. a subsidiary of Corning Glass, the companies settled their disputes by a 1916 agreement in which Hartford was granted an exclusive license by Corning's subsidiary to use the latter's patented glass making apparatus and processes for the production of glass containers while Corning obtained the exclusive right to Hartford's machinery and patents in Corning's lines of ware—the <b>pressed</b> <b>and</b> <b>blown</b> field or the non-container field.

40|$|Narrow Neck <b>Press</b> <b>and</b> <b>Blow</b> (NNPB) {{process is}} used to produce light weight bottles.

Invert <b>and</b> final <b>blow</b> takes place followed by take-out and annealing. Anchor Glass Container Corp. (AGC) uses NNPB technology in their glass making plants. The problem experienced by AGC in the process is that the heat dissipation through out the mold is not uniform and hence there is a non uniform temperature distribution in the finished bottle extracted from it. Specifically the shoulder region of the bottle stays at a higher temperature {{when compared with the}} other regions, becoming the limiting factor in determining the rate of bottle production. Excessive temperatures in any region leave the glass insufficiently rigid, allowing the bottle to sag or lean. An increased rate of production which demands faster and effective cooling of the bottle is desired and is the ultimate goal of this research effort. This problem can be effectively solved by increasing the amount of heat transferred from the mold to the cooling air, which can be done by increasing the surface area of the cooling passages. A mathematical model for calculating the amount of heat transferred to the cooling air is proposed in this thesis. The air properties at the exit of the mold and the amount of heat transferred by each cooling passage were obtained by using MATHCAD.

2500|$|Glass {{containers}} are 100% inspected; automatic machines, {{or sometimes}} persons, inspect every container {{for a variety}} of faults. Typical faults include small cracks in the glass called checks and foreign inclusions called stones which are pieces of the refractory brick lining of the melting furnace that break off and fall into the pool of molten glass, or more commonly oversized silica granules (sand) that have failed to melt and which subsequently are included in the final product. [...] These are especially important to select out {{due to the fact that}} they can impart a destructive element to the final glass product. [...] For example, since these materials can withstand large amounts of thermal energy, they can cause the glass product to sustain thermal shock resulting in explosive destruction when heated. Other defects include bubbles in the glass called blisters and excessively thin walls. Another defect common in glass manufacturing is referred to as a tear. [...] In the <b>press</b> <b>and</b> <b>blow</b> forming, if a plunger and mould are out of alignment, or heated to an incorrect temperature, the glass will stick to either item and become torn. [...] In addition to rejecting faulty containers, inspection equipment gathers statistical information and relays it to the forming machine operators in the hot end. Computer systems collect fault information and trace it to the mould that produced the container. This is done by reading the mould number on the container, which is encoded (as a numeral, or a binary code of dots) on the container by the mould that made it.
