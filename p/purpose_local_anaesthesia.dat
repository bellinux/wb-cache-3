This study aimed to evaluate cochlear implantation performed under <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> and sedation. METHOD: Twenty patients had a cochlear implant fitted under combined <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> (<b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> group) and 41 patients had one fitted under general anaesthesia (general anaesthesia group) for bilateral profound hearing loss, from 2011 to 2014. Surgical duration, period of post-operative hospitalisation and early post-operative symptoms were compared. In the <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> group, operative symptoms reported during the surgery and by questionnaire were analysed. RESULTS: Mean surgical duration was significantly shorter in the <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> group: 87 versus 122 minutes (p 0. 001). No {{significant difference was}} observed between the <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> and general anaesthesia groups regarding mean post-operative hospitalisation and early post-operative symptoms. Under <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> patients had no particular symptoms in 60 per cent of cases. The remaining patients in this group experienced vertigo (10 per cent), pain (20 per cent) and pain-related movement (10 per cent) during the intervention. These symptoms can be controlled with symptomatic treatment. CONCLUSION: Combined <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> for cochlear implantation is a good alternative to general anaesthesia for co-operating patients...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives {{to review}} the {{evidence}} for theoretical and clinical benefits of <b>local</b> or general <b>anaesthesia</b> for carotid endarterectomy. Methods literature review. Results animal studies suggest cerebral protection {{by a variety of}} general anaesthetic agents but clinical evidence is lacking. There is some clinical evidence that normal cerebral protective reflexes are preserved with <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> Shunt insertion is the most widely used method of providing cerebral protection with awake testing the most reliable monitoring technique for the identification of ischaemia. There are therefore theoretical arguments for a reduced risk of perioperative stroke when <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> is used and this is supported by a meta-analysis of non-randomised studies. Intraoperative blood pressure is always higher with <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> but the incidence of postoperative haemodynamic instability seems to be independent of anaesthetic technique. There is little evidence that myocardial ischaemia is more common with either anaesthetic technique but metanalysis of non-randomised again suggests fewer cardiac complications with <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> Cranial nerve injury and haematoma formation may be less common with <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> but the evidence is weak. There is no evidence that surgery is more difficult with <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> or that it is poorly tolerated by the patients. Conclusions there are theoretical arguments and clinical evidence that the outcome from carotid endarterectomy may be better when <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> is used with no significant disadvantages.

40|$|Background Endometrial {{ablation}} {{has been}} widely implemented in the outpatient setting. Many different protocols of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> during endometrial ablation are used and described. However, prospective studies to assess and evaluate these protocols appear to be scarce. Objectives To evaluate systematically the different <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> techniques in relation to pain perception during endometrial ablation. Search strategy Medline and Embase were systematically searched and reference lists of selected articles were checked for missed publications. Selection criteria All types of studies reporting the performance of endometrial ablation under <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> in ten or more women were included. Data collection and analysis Data about the procedure, the protocol of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> the acceptability and side-effects were extracted. Main results Twenty-five studies, involving 2013 women, were included. Applied anaesthesia techniques included intracervical, paracervical and intrauterine anaesthesia {{or a combination of}} these techniques. Women who received a combination of either intra-or paracervical anaesthesia and intrauterine injections reported significantly lower pain scores than those who received no <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> or intra-or paracervical anaesthesia alone (P = 0. 000), but the quality of evidence is low. The acceptability of endometrial ablation under <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> was high (77 - 94 %). Conclusion Endometrial ablation under <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> is a safe, feasible and acceptable procedure. The combination of either intra-or paracervical anaesthesia with intrauterine injections seems to be promising, but has to be investigated more thoroughl...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} thesis was, to {{evaluate}} <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> as an anaesthetic technique when performing knee arthroscopies, from a clinical and economical point of view, and to describe the total costs for surgery of knee injuries caused by sport activities in Stockholm. In a retrospective study of 6519 arthroscopies, we tried to estimate the failure rate for knee arthroscopy in <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> compared to the same procedure in general anaesthesia. Failure {{was defined as a}} rearthroscopy within 180 days due to persisting clinical symptoms. Encouraged by the comparable results between <b>local</b> and general <b>anaesthesia</b> in this study a prospective, randomized study including 400 patients was designed. Two hundred patients were randomized to <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> 100 patients to general anaesthesia and 100 to spinal anaesthesia. Ninety percent of the patients who had <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> were satisfied with the procedure. From the surgeon s point of view, technical problems were experienced in 5 % of the procedures in <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> Arthroscopy in <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> should be avoided if the patient has excessive synovitis. The results of the study led to the conclusion that elective knee arthroscopy can be performed under <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> in the majority of the patients. Furthermore the cost saving for an arthroscopy in <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> was SEK 1 011 per procedure compared to an arthroscopy in general or spinal anaesthesia with our described setup. The total hospital stay for patients was significantly lower for patients with <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> compared to both general and spinal anaesthesia. To determine health care costs for sports related knee surgery, we used data from three different databases an insurance company database including all players in the studied sports (football, floor ball, European team handball and ice hockey), the hospital patient record database and data from a county database containing information about all surgical procedures performed in Stockholm. The average knee surgery cost for all studied players in the population was SEK 108 in 1997. In conclusion, arthroscopy with <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> was an anaesthetic technique with clinical results comparable to other methods like general or spinal <b>anaesthesia.</b> Furthermore <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> was more cost and time effective. The total health costs for the community was low for players in football, floor ball, European team handball and ice hockey when their knee injuries were surgically treated...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{many studies}} {{confirming}} the feasibility {{and the interest}} of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> for umbilical repair, its use is not generalized amongst the abdominal surgeons. The advantages of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> are indeed clear, including reduced costs, reduced hospital stay and reduced post operative pain. The success of the procedure depends on the skills and the motivation of the surgeon, of the nursing teams, and of the patient him/herself. The Mayo repair is ideally performed under <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> but should be proposed to patients suffering from limited umbilical hernia with small defects. Prosthetic repairs might also be proposed under <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> but large defects with rectus diastasis might require a full Rives/Stoppa repair in which <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> could not be sufficient. In obese patients, laparoscopic repair might be beneficial despite higher cost and longer hospital stay. Practically <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> requires some patience and quiet in the operative room. Operators {{should be aware that}} the action of <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> is delayed after injection. Local anaesthetics should be buffered and at body temperature at time of injection. Local anaesthetics containing Adrenalin allow longer pain control, with limitation of bleeding and less toxicity. Large and brutal movements should be avoided. Ligature and section of parts of greater omentum are feasible under <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> without patient discomfort. Tension free repair should be favoured, and during Mayo repair, the only painful part of the repair is often the closure of the defect with the different stiches. The surgical and anaesthetic techniques for umbilical hernia repair should be tailored to the specific characteristics of the umbilical hernia and of the patient.

However, if a patient does not receive sufficient <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> continuous severe cough and physical movement may interrupt the procedure and reduce its safety. We therefore examined whether codeine phosphate is a useful premedication for bronchoscopy. The study design was a randomized comparison between codeine phosphate and a placebo in patients undergoing light <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> and midazolam sedation. We used low dose <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> (5 ml of nebulized 2 % xylocaine) on the assumption of insufficient <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> Patients were allocated to receive codeine phosphate 0 · 4 mgkg− 1 or a saline placebo 60 min before they were sedated with i. v. midazolam. If the patients exhibited severe cough during bronchoscopy, intrabronchial supplemental <b>local</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> (2 % xylocaine solution in 1 ml increments) was instilled via a bronchoscope to the trachea and segmental bronchi to suppress the cough.
