A particularly devout individual may in some cases {{even be able to}} see through a fox's disguise merely by perceiving them. Kitsune may also be exposed while in human form by their fear and hatred of dogs, and some become so rattled by their presence that they revert to the form of a fox and flee.|$|E

25|$|The most {{involved}} hat-trick was <b>perhaps</b> <b>when</b> Melbourne club cricketer Stephen Hickman, {{playing for}} Power House, achieved a hat-trick spread over three overs, two days, two innings, involving the same batsman twice, and observed {{by the same}} non-striker, with the hat-trick ball being bowled from the opposite end to the first two. In the Mercantile Cricket Association C Grade semi-final at Fawkner Park South Yarra in Melbourne, Gunbower United Cricket Club were 8 for 109 when Hickman came on to bowl his off spin. He took a wicket with the last ball of his third over and then bowled number 11 batsman Richard Higgins with the first ball of his next over to complete the Gunbower innings, leaving Chris Taylor the not out batsman. Power House scored 361 putting the game {{out of reach of}} Gunbower. In the second innings opener Taylor was joined by Higgins at the fall of the fourth wicket as Hickman returned to the attack. With his first ball, observed by an incredulous Taylor at the non-striker's end, he clean bowled Higgins leaving Higgins with a pair of golden ducks.|$|E

25|$|Like the birds, {{the study}} of mammals was largely driven by hunters {{and for a while}} it was largely {{restricted}} to trophy hunting. It was <b>perhaps</b> <b>when</b> R. C. Wroughton, a forest officer who began a concerted study of the small mammals of India through the network of members of the Bombay Natural History Society, that mammalogy in India began in real earnest. He was initially interested in Hymenoptera, especially ants and later scorpions. His interest in scorpions led him to R. I. Pocock. At the time, Pocock {{was in charge of the}} Arachnida although he was interested in mammals. Attempts to start a large scale collection effort did not take off. In 1904 Captain Glen Liston of the Indian Medical Service read a paper on Plague, Rats and Fleas in which he noted the lack of information on rodents. Another paper by Dr Hossack of the plague department appeared. This interest in plague suddenly enabled the BNHS to raise funds for collection of small mammals. While hunters sent in many specimens for identification, there were a few who studied the habits of species in the wild. A major study of the rodents and bats was conducted by George Edward Dobson (1848–1895) a medical doctor by profession. Other notable mammalologists included Richard Lydekker (1849–1915), Robert Armitage Sterndale, Stanley Henry Prater (1890–1960) and Brian Houghton Hodgson (1800–1894). Richard Lydekker worked with the Geological survey of India and his primary focus during the period was on the fossil mammals of India.|$|E

500|$|Æthelflæd {{was born}} around 870, the oldest child of King Alfred the Great and his Mercian wife, Ealhswith, {{who was a}} {{daughter}} of Æthelred Mucel, ealdorman of the Gaini, one of the tribes of Mercia. Ealhswith's mother, Eadburh, {{was a member of}} the Mercian royal house, probably a descendant of King Coenwulf (796–821). Æthelflæd was thus half-Mercian and the alliance between Wessex and Mercia was sealed by her marriage to Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians. They are mentioned in Alfred's will, which probably dates to the 880s. Æthelflæd, described only as [...] "my eldest daughter", received an estate and 100 mancuses, while Æthelred, the only ealdorman to be mentioned by name, received a sword worth 100 mancuses. Æthelflæd was first recorded as Æthelred's wife in a charter of 887, when he granted two estates to the see of Worcester [...] "with the permission and sign-manual of King Alfred" [...] and the attestors included [...] "Æthelflæd conjux". The marriage may have taken place earlier, <b>perhaps</b> <b>when</b> he submitted to Alfred following the recovery of London in 886. Æthelred was much older than Æthelflæd and they had one known child, a daughter called Ælfwynn. Æthelstan, the eldest son of Edward the Elder and future king of England, was brought up in their court and, in the view of Martin Ryan, certainly joined their campaigns against the Vikings.|$|E

2500|$|Introducing Palmer for {{a reading}} at the DIA Arts Center in 1996, Brighde Mullins noted that Palmer's poetics is both [...] "situated yet active". Palmer alludes to this himself, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>when</b> {{he speaks of}} poetry {{signaling}} a [...] "site of passages". He says, [...] "The space of the page is taken as a site in itself, a syntactical and visual space to be expressively exploited, {{as was the case}} with the Black Mountain poets, as well as writers such as Frank O'Hara, perhaps partly in response to gestural abstract painting." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Library Cave was walled off {{sometime}} {{early in}} the 11th century. A number of theories have been proposed {{as the reason for}} sealing the caves. Stein first proposed that the cave had become a waste repository for venerable, damaged and used manuscripts and hallowed paraphernalia and then sealed <b>perhaps</b> <b>when</b> the place came under threat. Following this interpretation some suggested that the handwritten manuscripts of the Tripitaka became obsolete when printing became widespread, the older manuscripts were therefore stored away. [...] Another suggestion is that the cave was simply used as a book storehouse for documents which accumulated over a century and a half, then sealed up when it became full.|$|E

According to O'Shaughnessy, 'she cut a valiant figure, this [...] "slip of a girl", who stood unsupported before the five legal elders of the land. They were obviously impressed by her courage, her sheer elegant dash, her shining intellect finding expression in felicitous language, her good manners, charm, poise.

2500|$|Compositional {{drawings}} for {{the figures of}} Lazarus and his two attendants were supplied by Michelangelo. [...] In addition to the drawing in the British Museum illustrated here, there are other drawings by Michelangelo there and in Bayonne, all of Lazarus {{and the two men}} supporting him, except for one of a foot, perhaps relating to Christ. [...] Modern imaging techniques show that a different figure of Lazarus exists in the underdrawing, which was apparently changed to match one of Michelangelo's drawings (illustrated below) while painting was in progress, <b>perhaps</b> <b>when</b> Michelangelo visited Rome in January 1518. [...] A drawing by Sebastiano seems to contain a sketch for this figure as well as one for the Saint Peter in the painting.|$|E
2500|$|Others, such as Pelliot, {{suggested}} an alternative scenario, that the monks hurriedly hid the documents {{in advance of}} an attack by invaders, <b>perhaps</b> <b>when</b> Xi Xia invaded in 1035. This theory was proposed {{in light of the}} absence of documents from Xi Xia and the disordered state in which Pelliot found the room (perhaps a misinterpretation because unbeknownst to him the room was disturbed by Stein months before). Another theory posits that the items were from a monastic library and hidden due to threats from Muslims who were moving eastward. This theory proposes that the monks of a nearby monastery heard about the fall of the Buddhist kingdom of Khotan to Karakhanids invaders from Kashgar in 1006 and the destruction it caused, so they sealed their library to avoid it being destroyed. [...] The latest date recorded in the documents found in the cave is generally accepted to be 1002, and although other dates have been suggested, the cave was likely to have been sealed not long after that date.|$|E
