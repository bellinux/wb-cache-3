40|$|Article {{describe}} organisation of gearboxes Hypertronic CVT and Extroid CVT (FIg. 1, 2, 3) with controlled frictional transmission with coherent {{gear ratio}} change and hydromechanic changemoment. Used simple frictional transmission has not reserve motion ability (Fig. 5) and then car accelerating {{by force of}} gear ratio change is unable. To enable fluent car accelerating classical gearboxes CVT contain hydrodynamic changer before controlled frictional transmission. Hydrodynamic changer solves car acceleration, but not reverse motion of car. To create reverse motion gearbox Extroid contain, (sun and planet reversing reducer), between hydrodynamic changer and frictional transmission. (Fig. 2). Simple frictional transmission has maximum gear ratio to fast. Output of controlled frictional transmission contains decelerating reducer to be maximum gear ratio of gearbox CVT unitary. (Fig. 2, 4). Hydrodynamic changer in gearboxes CVT deteriorates driving attributes of car at starting and at overtaking slowly car to the acclivity. Inconvenient attributes of serial wiring of hydrodynamic changer and simple frictional transmission can eliminate wiring of frictional transmission to branched flow system with distribution differential at output. (Fig. 9). So come into existence differntial controlled frictional transmission (DRTP) with reverse motion ability and ability to realise controlled starting of car. Examples of configuration DRTP are at pict. 10, 11, 12. Comparing of static moment qualifications of classical gearbox CVT and gearbox DRTP is at pict. 13. Gearboxes CVT with hydrodynamic changer oppress engine at starting according to pump qualification of changer. Gearbox DRTP controlled moment oppresses engine. Controlled oppress moment behaviour is arbitrary workable, for example according to optimal oppress qualification of engine. (L 3). Fig. 15 contains oppress qualification of DRTP and parabolic oppress qualification of hydrodynamic changer CVT. Fig. 16. Driving moment at input DRTP grows faster. Time behaviour of speed at overtaking to the acclivity is compared ad Fig. 18. Car with gearbox DRTP has better dynamic of motion. Fig. 19 contains trajectory at overtaking to the acclivity. Fig. 20 contains car speed behaviour at accelerating at <b>plain.</b> <b>Car</b> with gearbox DRTP actives speed 100 km/h in 4, 8 sec, and car with gearbox CVT hydrodynamic gear 7, 5 sec...|$|E
50|$|The Washington Street Elevated opened June 10, 1901 to Dudley {{and many}} {{streetcar}} routes that had operated via Dudley were truncated {{there with a}} transfer to the El. This included the Jamaica Plain route via Dudley. The extension of the Elevated to Forest Hills (adjacent to Arborway) on November 22, 1909 provided a faster route downtown from Arborway (above the Washington Street streetcar lines), but the Jamaica <b>Plain</b> <b>cars</b> used a completely different route to get there.|$|R
50|$|The N16 Almera offered great {{improvements}} {{over the}} previous generation Almera in terms of handling, tyre grip and drive dynamics. The N16 Almera felt much more sure-footed {{on the road and}} was exceptionally nimble for a <b>plain</b> family <b>car.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Tracks {{that later}} {{became part of}} the [...] "E" [...] Branch were built in 1859 along Huntington Avenue from Brigham Circle west into Brookline, as part of a branch from the {{original}} Jamaica Plain route, later used by the [...] route. A new cutoff was built from this route via Huntington Avenue ca. 1883, allowing cars to run to Park Square via existing tracks on Boylston Street. In 1906 the connection along South Huntington Avenue was built to connect this newer route on Huntington to the older route on Centre. Additionally, between 1888 and 1897, the [...] "Dudley Street Crossover" [...] was built along Centre Street (moved to Roxbury Street by 1925) to connect the line to an existing loop west from Dudley to Eliot Square. This allowed Jamaica <b>Plain</b> <b>cars</b> to run to Dudley and towards downtown from there.|$|R
60|$|Down {{the slopes}} Sherikov's guards raced, toward the stalled cars. Clouds of heat rose up and boiled across the <b>plain</b> as the <b>cars</b> fired {{up at the}} running men. A robot gun dropped like a slug onto the plain and screamed toward the cars, firing as it came.|$|R
50|$|The models {{created by}} Code 3 Collectibles, were stock models {{which had been}} {{customized}} or converted from their original state. A few examples of Code 3 Collectibles models <b>plain</b> white <b>cars</b> or vans which have been painted or have had decals added with the livery of a police force such as stripes, force badge/crest, force code etc. Extras such as lightbars and possibly tools have been added as well. Another example would be a plain truck which has been decaled/painted to have the livery parts of a company. Sometimes creating new parts, removing parts, or adding extra parts are done as well {{to add to the}} realism of the model.|$|R
50|$|From {{the end of}} 1995 tobacco {{sponsorship}} was outlawed. In a tight market, {{the team}} struggled to find a replacement sponsor, running just one <b>plain</b> white <b>car</b> in the opening rounds of 1996 ATCC for Skaife. Eventually some funding came the team's way from Sega and Holden's Network Q second hand division, {{but it was a}} long way short of the team's previous funding levels. As a result of the lack of funds, GMS was forced to release Jim Richards. The financial situation also saw the team fall behind on development which saw Skaife fall to 9th in the ATCC. The team then recruited dual BTCC champion John Cleland to partner Skaife at Bathurst where Skaife would qualify the car 9th and the pair would finish in a credible 7th outright.|$|R
50|$|The UV {{series was}} {{designed}} {{with the aid}} of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and was specifically intended to improve on and address the flaws of the then-current TM Stuka tramcars which debuted in 1939. In 1948, Ganz showcased a prototype tram set on the Budapest International Fair (BNV), made up from three modified TM cars damaged in the war. The modified TMs at the ends were referred to as TV, resolving to T típusú távvezérelt motorkocsi ("type T remotely controlled motor coach"), the most significant alteration being that they were capable of operating as multiple units with each other with or without the third TM car acting as a <b>plain</b> trailer <b>car</b> in between. This prototype tram was nicknamed Szellem ("Ghost"). While the TV didn't reached mass production, it served as a basis for the UV design.|$|R
50|$|Terry {{decided to}} leave WA and in a T-model Ford he crossed the Nullarbor <b>Plain.</b> The <b>car</b> blew up during its long journey. He was now stuck in Adelaide and South Australia was not {{appreciated}} by strangers from other states. As these were the depression years they were having enough problems feeding their own. He kept performing wherever he could. Six months went by {{and he decided to}} move on to Melbourne. A racing car driver was driving to Melbourne for a competition and Terry was able to hitch a ride with him. He found work in Melbourne including Sunday night performances at the Kings, Savoy, Princess and Apollo theatres. He worked with Ronny Shand, an acrobatic comic as well as Jo Lawman and Stella Lamond. Scanlon remembered nursing Toni Lamond when she was a baby.|$|R
2500|$|The new styling was {{the work}} of {{designer}} Richard A. Teague, who would go on to design the 1968 Javelin and AMX. Many viewed the newly designed station wagon as the best looking of any American wagon, with its new trim lines, with ample passenger, and cargo room. Led by the top-line 440-series convertible, they were arguably the 1964's most attractive Detroit compacts. Car Life magazine titled its road test of the 1964 Rambler American: [...] "The Original <b>Plain</b> Jane Compact <b>Car</b> Just Got Back From the Beauty Parlor".|$|R
2500|$|When the Orange Line was rebuilt in the 1980s, it was rerouted from deteriorating {{elevated}} railway {{structures to}} instead follow existing rail right-of-way, to greatly reduce land acquisition and construction costs. [...] This had the {{side effect of}} changing its course away from the lower income areas of Everett, Chelsea, and Roxbury (where residents {{are less likely to}} own cars, and depend more on public transit), toward the more affluent towns of Malden and Medford, as well as sections of the Jamaica <b>Plain</b> neighborhood (where <b>car</b> ownership is higher, and thus, reliance on public transit is far lower).|$|R
50|$|In mid-April, the rebels, led by Jund al-Aqsa and the Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria, {{started a}} new {{offensive}} to retake areas they had previously lost in the al-Ghab <b>Plain,</b> exploding a <b>car</b> bomb at a grain silos {{near the village of}} Mansura. Concurrently, an assault was launched in Latakia province where the rebels captured half of the Qalat Mountains and the village of al-Bayda. A subsequent Army counter-attack reversed all rebel gains in Latakia. One week later, the rebels once again launched an offensive in both the al-Ghab Plain and the Latakia mountains. In Latakia, they advanced in the area of three villages before being pushed back. In the al-Ghab Plain, they captured the village of Khirbat Al-Naqous and contested the village of Haqoura, before being repelled from Haqoura.|$|R
5|$|Before the 1991 season, Zerex {{ended their}} {{sponsorship}} of Kulwicki's team. Junior Johnson came calling again, {{looking for a}} driver for his revived second team that had last seen Neil Bonnett behind the wheel in 1986. Kulwicki turned down Johnson's $1 million offer thinking that he had secured a sponsorship deal with Maxwell House Coffee. Johnson then went to Maxwell House himself and obtained the sponsorship for his new car, which Sterling Marlin was hired to drive instead. Kulwicki was forced to begin the season without a sponsor, paying all of the team's expenses {{out of his own}} pocket. At the opening race of the season, the 1991 Daytona 500, fivecars raced with paint schemes representing different branches of the United States military to show support for the American forces involved in the Gulf War. It was the first use of special paint schemes in NASCAR history. Kulwicki's car was sponsored by the United States Army in a one-race deal. After running the second and third races of the season in a <b>plain</b> white unsponsored <b>car,</b> Kulwicki's luck finding a sponsor changed for the better at Atlanta Motor Speedway.|$|R
50|$|Final Lap 3 (Fainaru Rappu Tsurī), as {{the name}} suggests, is the third title in the Final Lap series, {{released}} by Namco in 1992; like its precursors (as well as Four Trax, and Suzuka 8 Hours), it runs on Namco System 2 hardware, and allows up to eight players to play simultaneously when four two-player cabinets are linked together. It features four new tracks set in England, France, Italy, and Spain - and for the third time, the players must take control of either the Williams, McLaren, March or Lotus cars (which have again been redesigned), in a Formula One race {{on one of the}} four tracks. In the single player mode, the player's score will again be based on how far his car travels until the timer runs out or he completes four laps of the chosen circuit, and hitting another car or a billboard will again not cause a player car to explode, like it did in the two Pole Position games, but it can still send it (or the other car) spinning off the track, costing valuable time; in the multiplayer mode, up to eight players can again race simultaneously, which shall again allow for better lap times, as the <b>plain</b> green CPU-controlled <b>cars</b> (which have again also been redesigned) will appear less frequently. Barcelona is the easiest one of the four and is recommended for the novice players - and once a player has mastered it he will be ready to move on to Imola, followed by Paul Ricard (which had been replaced in 1991 by Magny-Cours in F1). However, Silverstone (in 1987-90 configuration, without the 1991 overhaul) is the hardest one of the four and is therefore only recommended for the expert players and the ones who had managed to master Suzuka in the two previous titles.|$|R
50|$|Final Lap 2 (Fainaru Rappu Tsū) is {{a sequel}} to Final Lap (released by Namco in 1990); it runs upon Namco System 2 hardware, and much like the {{original}} title (and Four Trax), it allows up to eight players to play simultaneously when four two-player sit-down cabinets are connected together, but this one features four different tracks which are set in the game's home country of Japan (the Suzuka Circuit from the original), Italy, Monaco, and the United States (which resembles the Test track that was featured in Pole Position II). For a second time, the players must take control of either the Williams, McLaren, March or Lotus cars, which have been redesigned, in a Formula One race {{on one of the}} four tracks - and in the single player mode, the player's score shall again be based upon how far his car travels until the timer runs out or he completes four laps of the chosen circuit, and hitting another car or a billboard will again not cause a player car to explode like it did in the two Pole Position games, but it can still send it (or the other car) spinning off the track, costing valuable time.

The United States track is the easiest of the four, and is recommended for the novice players - and once a player has mastered it, he will be ready {{to move on to the}} Monaco track, then the Italy one (which are of medium and medium-hard difficulties). However, the Japan track is the hardest one, given that it is the Suzuka Circuit from the original game and it is therefore only recommended for the expert players or the players who had managed to master it in the original.|$|R
2500|$|As of 2015, the {{department}} uses {{a large number}} of Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors as their main fleet of patrol vehicles which was first ordered in 1996 replacing the Chevrolet Caprice 9C1 (used between 1988 and in patrol service until 2004 (replacing the Ford LTD Crown Victoria squads to 1987 along with M-bodied Mopars (primarily the Plymouth Gran Fury (both R and M platform) last used in 1989)). They have Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor models from dating from 1999 to 2011. Since Ford no longer produces the [...] "crown Vic" [...] (procurement of the Crown Vic ended in April 2011 when the orders were filled), The department has chosen to phase in the Chevy Tahoe PPV and Ford Police Interceptor Utility(Explorer) as the successor to the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor. The department is continuing to test new Chevy Caprice PPV models and Ford Taurus Interceptors (including the fifth-generation Explorer) as well - the test mules as of 2015 have been integrated into the mainstream vehicle fleet. [...] It also uses pickup trucks from the Big Three, such as the Chevrolet Colorado, Ford F150, and Dodge Ram for their Truck Enforcement Unit. There is also a small fleet of Dodge Chargers and Chevrolet Camaro s, which are mainly used as [...] "stealth traffic patrol vehicles" [...] (which is part of the Traffic Enforcement division). The stealth vehicles are <b>plain</b> white police <b>cars</b> with a slicktop roof and gray, reflective [...] "HOUSTON POLICE" [...] graphics on the side {{as well as on the}} front bumper, and hidden emergency lights that are driven by uniformed officers. The Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor is also used in this manner - as of late 2011 the stealth patrol vehicles are now painted black. The stealth squads have been supplemented with 14 Ford Taurus Police Interceptors in early 2014 (painted black). Solo (motorcycle) officers use Harley-Davidson motorcycles. [...] The patrol vehicle livery, painted white with blue lettered graphics dating back to 1999 (which replaced the Columbia Blue livery last used in 1998 and retired a decade later), is being phased out for a black and white color scheme where 100 vehicles are painted from $60,000 earmarked from asset forfeiture funds (under HPD policy the previous livery is still used in service until official retirement). HPD squads are usually retired when the vehicle reaches 100,000 miles (they are not reassigned to reserve or secondary duty as with the Austin or San Antonio PD after 80,000 miles) - some squads dating over 10 model years old which are no longer used for patrol duty are usually reassigned either as bait squads (HPD will park an unmanned squad in a high crime area or illegal dumping site) or the Mobility Response Division - the older HPD fleet used by Mobility Response have been retired and replaced with Ford F150 extended cab pickup trucks from the Truck Enforcement Unit. Around 2016 the Houston Chronicle revealed that some of the older squads are still in service but the breakdown rate has increased - a 100,000 mile marked squad (or 120,000 mile unmarked vehicle) has the life expectancy of an automobile with 300,000 miles with regular maintenance. At the time HPD ordered 50 new Ford Police Interceptor Utilities for the command staff but not the mainstream vehicle fleet ({{the department}} has procured newer vehicles but the budget crunch has taken in a few new orders whilst the older squads are still operational. A budget crunch in major Texas cities is partly to blame where municipal budgets are usually slashed including priority spending for first responders. Most modern HPD Patrol cars today are Blue and white saying [...] " [...] HOUSTON POLICE" [...] on the side.Newer models use a mixture of black and white paint now with 911 EMERGENCY listed on the rear side of the car or truck.|$|R
