On November 17, 2007, federal judge Timothy C. Batten, Sr. sentenced Cox to 26 years in prison. He also ordered Cox to pay $5.97 million in restitution. He will not be eligible for release until 2029.|$|E

40|$|All jurisdictions - whether common {{or civil}} law - punish repeat {{offenders}} more severely. In this sense, the Recidivist Sentencing Premium is as universal as {{the principle of}} proportionality. Retributive sentencing theorists fall into two camps: one group rejects the use of <b>previous</b> <b>convictions</b> at sentencing while the second assigns a very limited role for criminal antecedents. This article explores the issue and proposes a culpability-based justification for considering <b>previous</b> <b>convictions</b> at sentencing. According to this proposal, <b>previous</b> <b>convictions</b> justify more severe treatment {{in the way that}} premeditation is used as an aggravating circumstance. Offenders who plan their crimes and offenders with <b>previous</b> <b>convictions</b> should be considered more blameworthy and hence worthy of harsher punishments. This model is considered with reference to community views of sentencing...|$|R

25|$|The Silverman {{trial was}} unusual in many aspects, namely the rare {{combination}} of a mother/son team {{and the fact that}} no body was ever recovered. Nonetheless, the jury was unanimous in voting to convict them not only of murder but of 117 other charges including robbery, burglary, conspiracy, grand larceny, illegal weapons possession, forgery and eavesdropping on their first poll on the subject. The judge also took the unusual step of ordering Kimes not to speak to the media even after the jury had been sequestered {{as a result of her}} passing a note to New York Times reporter David Rhode in court. The judge threatened to have Kimes handcuffed during further court appearances if she persisted and restricted her telephone access to calls to her lawyers. The judge contended that Kimes was attempting to influence the jury as they may have seen or heard any such interviews, and that there would be no cross-examination as there would be in court. Kimes had earlier chosen to not take the stand in her own defense after the judge ruled that prosecutors could question her about the <b>previous</b> <b>conviction</b> on slavery charges.|$|E
25|$|Courtney was {{released}} from prison and returned to his home in the Glencairn area {{to the north of the}} Shankill. However in 2013 Courtney was convicted of the assault of Tracey Coulter at the offices of the Lower Shankill Community Association. According to court reports Coulter had gone to the offices to speak to Courtney's associates about the death of her cousin, a drug-user, a week earlier. During Coulter's visit she had become embroiled in an argument with an unnamed man when Courtney intervened and head-butted her. Courtney is due to be sentenced in January 2014. Coulter, who is the daughter of Jackie Coulter (a close associate of Adair's who was killed in the 2002 feud with the UVF), had her house burnt down in an arson attack soon after Courtney's conviction. She publicly accused the UDA of being behind the attack. In December 2013 Courtney was again brought before the courts, to face charges of harassing Coulter in the aftermath of his <b>previous</b> <b>conviction,</b> as well as threatening to kill campaigner Raymond McCord, who was with Courtney during the alleged incident. Courtney was given a suspended prison sentence of four months and ordered to pay Coulter £500 for the incident. He was subsequently also found guilty of threatening to kill McCord, although a similar charge relating to Coulter was dismissed.|$|E

The data used are taken from the England andWales Offenders Index and include official conviction histories of six birth cohorts of offenders.

A Poisson log-linear model approach is taken. Including data on <b>previous</b> <b>convictions</b> can help explain heterogeneity. An interaction of <b>previous</b> <b>convictions</b> with yearwas found to be important, indicating that additional <b>previous</b> <b>convictions</b> have a greater effect on the conviction rate for more recent years.
