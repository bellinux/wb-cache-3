50|$|Interest that a {{creditor}} {{would have}} earned on an amount, {{had it been}} paid, is a loss that flows naturally from the breach and therefore constitutes damages that can be claimed. At common law, mora interest on a debt becomes <b>payable</b> <b>from</b> the <b>date</b> that a liquidated debt falls due. Where no date for payment is agreed, payment becomes due on demand from the creditor. In a claim for unliquidated damages, the debtor cannot be in mora {{until such time as}} the amount of damages has been fixed by a court. Interest is therefore only <b>payable</b> <b>from</b> the <b>date</b> of judgment.|$|R
