2500|$|The {{mathematical}} models used {{in classical}} electromagnetism, quantum electrodynamics (QED) {{and the standard}} model all view the electromagnetic vacuum as a linear system with no overall observable consequence (e.g. {{in the case of}} the Casimir effect, Lamb shift, and so on) these phenomena can be explained by alternative mechanisms other than action of the vacuum by arbitrary changes to the normal ordering of field operators. See alternative theories section). This is a consequence of viewing electromagnetism as a U(1) gauge theory, which topologically does not allow the complex interaction of a field with and on itself. In higher symmetry groups and in reality, the vacuum is not a calm, randomly fluctuating, largely immaterial and passive substance, but at times can be viewed as a turbulent virtual plasma that can have complex vortices (i.e. solitons vis-à-vis particles), entangled states and a rich nonlinear structure. There are many observed nonlinear physical electromagnetic phenomena such as Aharonov–Bohm (AB) and Altshuler–Aronov–Spivak (AAS) effects, Berry, Aharonov– Anandan, Pancharatnam and Chiao–Wu <b>phase</b> <b>rotation</b> effects, Josephson effect, ...|$|E

40|$|In {{coherent}} digital optical receivers, blind {{carrier phase}} recovery may incur errors, causing phase slips. A channel including blind phase estimation is modeled as an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, affected by random phase slips that occur {{with a certain}} probability. For such a channel, block differential modulation (BDM) has been recently shown to achieve almost the same capacity as coherent AWGN channels. This paper proposes a concatenated coding scheme, with an inner code based on low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, that embeds block differential demodulation, to make it robust to occasional phase slips. This additional feature comes at no practical cost and performs very close to a standard soft decoded LDPC code.
