40|$|The valve and the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> {{of a gas}} {{ion laser}} were {{electrically}} insulated from the laser discharge path by connecting them in series with the cathode of the laser. The laser cathode can be grounded and preferably is a cold cathode although a hot cathode may be used instead. The cold cathode was provided with a central aperture to which was connected both the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> and the gas pressure reservoir through the valve. This will effectively prevent electric discharges from passing either to the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> or the valve which would otherwise destroy the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Vacuum system set-up is {{presented}} {{and used for}} calibration of <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> {{in the region of}} rough vacuum, from 103 mbar to 10 - 1 mbar, with dry air. The capacitance manometer is used for the calibration of piezoresistant manometer, oil, mercury and mercury micrometers U manometers. The applicability of the experimental set-up and obtained results for the low <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> calibration in the medium and high vacuum region is approved. It was shown how calibration of some cheaper <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> might be performed and reliable measurements of the pressure may be made in the region that is of interest for atomic and molecular collision physics and low-pressure gas discharges. It was also shown that mentioned calibration procedure could be used for calibration of different U manometer types in order to renormalize older atomic and molecular collision data.

40|$|Abstract. For {{a case of}} constant-rate liquid {{production}} from a single well centered in a horizontal, homogeneous-acting, isopachous, and infinite reservoir, based on fundamentals of fluid flow in porous media the bottom hole flowing pressure never stabilize. In the process of field well testing, however, pressure values measured by the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> which has a definite resolution value will not change after a period, so the bottom hole flowing pressure can {{be considered to be}} stabilized. According to this situation, through theoretical derivation, a stabilized time formula is firstly proposed, by which the time after which the bottom hole flowing pressure measured with a <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> will be stabilized can be calculated, and the stabilized time for a given <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> is in direct proportion to the liquid producing rate, but in inverse proportion to the resolution ratio of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge.</b> Applied the stabilized time formula, a new formula of detectable radius can be derived, by which the effect of resolution of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> can be considered. Secondly, the time after which the value of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> measured in the bottom hole of the observation well starts to change during interference testing is obtained, and the time is related to the fluid flow rate and the distance between the producing well and the observation well. The conclusion can be applied as a reference in the design process of working system during well testing...|$|R
