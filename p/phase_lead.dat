50|$|Pribram {{suggests}} that there are two layers of cortical processing: a surface structure of separated and localized neural circuits and a deep structure of the dendritic arborization that binds the surface structure together. The deep structure contains distributed memory, while the surface structure acts as the retrieval mechanism. Binding occurs through the temporal synchronization of the oscillating polarizations in the synaptodendritic web. It had been thought that binding only occurred when there was no <b>phase</b> <b>lead</b> or lag present, but a study by Saul and Humphrey found that cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus do in fact produce these. Here <b>phase</b> <b>lead</b> and lag act to enhance sensory discrimination, acting as a frame to capture important features. These filters are also similar to the lenses necessary for holographic functioning.|$|E

50|$|Research {{has also}} {{investigated}} how women's {{food and clothing}} choice also appears to differ across the menstrual cycle.

The fertile <b>phase</b> <b>lead</b> to a significant increase for sexy and attention grabbing items of clothing but does not significantly impact consumption of make-up related products. It was additionally found that the hormonal changes that accompany the different phases of the menstrual cycle, specifically progesterone and oestrogen, have the same pattern as money spent on food related consumption and appearance related consumption respectively.|$|E
50|$|Capillary {{electrochromatography}} (CEC) is a chromatographic {{technique in}} which the mobile phase is driven through the chromatographic bed by electroosmosis. Capillary electrochromatography {{is a combination of}} two analytical techniques, High performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis. Capillary electrophoresis aims to separate analytes {{on the basis of their}} mass to charge ratio by passing a high voltage across ends of a capillary tube, which is filled with the analyte. High performance liquid chromatography separates analytes by passing them, under high pressure, through a column filled with stationary phase. The interactions between the analytes and the stationary phase and mobile <b>phase</b> <b>lead</b> to the separation of the analytes. In capillary electrochromatography capillaries, packed with HPLC stationary phase, are subjected to a high voltage. Separation is achieved by electrophoretic migration of solutes and differential partitioning.|$|E

50|$|Lead was {{originally}} added to fuel as an additive to prevent engine knocking. In the 1970s, virtually all gasoline {{used in the}} United States contained lead with an average concentration of almost 2.4 grams per gallon. By the mid 1970s, the EPA began formulating plans to <b>phase</b> <b>lead</b> out of fuel for two main reasons. There was growing concern over lead's potential effects on human health, especially with respected hypertension and cognitive development in children. Additionally, {{the introduction of the}} catalytic converter in new automobiles manufactured after 1975 required an adjustment to the fuel standards. Catalytic converters were utilized in new automobiles to help meet the hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxide emission standards mandated by the 1970 Clean Air Act. Unfortunately, the catalytic converters could only function properly with unleaded fuel.|$|E
5000|$|Steltzner is {{employed}} at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory {{where he has}} worked for about ten years designing, testing and building the sky crane landing system for the Curiosity rover. Steltzner was <b>phase</b> <b>lead</b> and development manager for EDL (Entry, Descent and Landing) of the lander, which successfully landed on Mars on August 5, 2012. The sky crane is an entirely new technology system, Steltzner said of it [...] "When people look at it...it looks crazy. That's a very natural thing. Sometimes {{when we look at}} it, it looks crazy. It is the result of reasoned, engineering thought. But it still looks crazy." [...] The sky crane allows for a precise landing ellipse opening up many areas of Mars for exploration that were previously inaccessible due to uneven terrain.|$|E
50|$|Rotherham-born Matt, is no {{stranger}} to the Millers, previously lining up against them for Macclesfield Town and Notts County in recent years, as well as being in opposition at Don Valley and Millmoor for Mansfield Town and of course Sheffield Wednesday. However, what people may not realise is that whilst he’s been a thorn {{in the side of the}} Millers on the field, he’s been working with his hometown club for the past five years as a part-time coach with various youth teams. After his contract with relegated Macclesfield Town ran out in the summer of 2012, Matt made the switch into full-time coaching with the Millers, whilst continuing to play in the Evo-Stick League for Stocksbridge Park Steels.
