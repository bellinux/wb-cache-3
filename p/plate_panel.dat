40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} analytical modelling {{of the effects of}} cracks in structural plates and panels within aerospace systems such as aeroplane fuselage, wing, and tail-plane structures, and, as such, {{is part of a larger}} body of research into damage detection methodologies in such systems. This study is based on generating a so-called reduced order analytical model of the behaviour of the <b>plate</b> <b>panel,</b> within which a crack with some arbitrary characteristics is present, and which is subjected to a force that causes it to vibrate. In practice such a scenario is potentially extremely dangerous as it can lead to failure, with obvious consequences. The equation that is obtained is in the form of the classical Duffing equation, in this case, the coefficients within the equation contain information about the geometrical and mass properties of the plate, the loading and boundary conditions, and the geometry, location, and potentially the orientation of the crack. This equation has been known for just over a century and has in the last few decades received very considerable attention from both the analytical dynamics community and also from the dynamical systems researchers, in particular the work of Ueda, Thompson, in the 1970 s and 1980 s, and Thomsen in the 1990 s and beyond. An approximate analytical solution is obtained by means of the perturbation method of multiple scales. This powerful method was popularized in the 1970 s by Ali H. Nayfeh, and discussed in his famous books, ‘Perturbation Methods’ (1974) and ‘Nonlinear Oscillations’ (1979, with D. T. Mook), and also by J. Murdock (1990), and M. P. Cartmell et al. (2003) and has been shown to be immensely useful for a wide range of nonlinear vibration problems. In this work it is shown that different boundary conditions can be admitted for the plate and that the modal natural frequencies are sensitive to the crack geometry. Bifurcatory behaviour of the cracked plate has then been examined numerically, for a range of parameters. The model has been tested against experimental work and against a Finite Element model, with good corroboration from both. In all events, this is a significant new result in the field and one that if implemented within a larger damage detection strategy, could be of considerable practical use.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} {{ultimate}} strength and collapse analysis of ship structures. Within this are, the attention is directed towards simple and efficient nonlinear {{finite element models}} for stiffened <b>plate</b> <b>panels</b> in ship structures. Several types of Morley elements are investigated and two are selected for further development. These triangular elements assume constant stress distribution over the element area. The first element considered is a nonlinear facet shell element which is valid within moderate rotations. Its elastic formulation has been proposed earlier. In this work, the element matrices are extended to account for material plasticity. The second element, is a displacement-based curved element which undergoes arbitrary large displacements and rotations. The discrete equilibrium equations for this element are re-derived {{so as to make}} them more efficient with standard Newton-Raphson solution procedures. Material plasticity formulation using through-the thickness integration as well as resultants plasticity is presented. The evolution laws are derived from the natural laws of thermodynamics, and a return mapping algorithm with a backward Euler difference scheme is used for a solution of the evolution equations. The plasticity computations involve a solution of a single scalar yield surface for the plasticity multiplier. By performing the matrix algebra analytically, simple and explicit expressions are derived. These equations reduce the computational costs remarkably. Numerical examples, mostly selected from well-know benchmark problems, are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed formulations. Very good agreement is obtained when compared with published results. In addition, typical problems for ultimate strength and collapse analysis of ship hull-girder are analyzed. These include plate girders, stiffened <b>plate</b> <b>panels,</b> as well as a cruciform element. The results show good agreement not only with those obtained from commercial finite element programs, but also from the experimental observations. For stiffened <b>plate</b> <b>panels,</b> comparison is made with DNV design rules, which is found to give non-conservative estimates for some load conditions. Finally, a study on multi-span stiffened panels is performed so as to compare the estimates provided by the conventional single span model. It is observed that the conventional model provides conservative estimates, and the effect of transverse frames is especially significant on the finite element model of stiffened panels. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

40|$|The {{strength}} or stiffness of a reinforced concrete (RC), metallic or timber member {{can be increased}} by bonding a thin FRP or steel plate to its external surface. In such plated members, debonding of the thin plate from the original member is often the controlling failure mode, and such debonding depends strongly on the interfacial stresses in the adhesive layer between the member and the plate. This paper {{is concerned with the}} prediction of these interfacial stresses using the finite element method. The paper is primarily focused on simply-supported straight plated beams subjected to a uniformly-distributed load as a widely studied benchmark case. Five different finite element modeling approaches based on different assumptions for the deformations of the three components of such a plated beam (beam, adhesive layer and plate) are described. The predictions of the five models are then compared {{with each other and with}} analytical solutions of different levels of sophistication. These comparisons illustrate clearly how each assumption affects the predicted interfacial stresses and identify the beam-spring-beam (B-S-B) model as a relatively simple yet sufficiently accurate model for practical use in predicting interfacial stresses and debonding failure in more complex structural members bonded with a thin plate.
