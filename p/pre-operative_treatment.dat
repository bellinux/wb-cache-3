MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue micro-arrays from pre- and post-treatment biopsies of 99 patients with rectal cancer treated with pre-operative (chemo) radiotherapy were stained for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), carbonic anhydrase IX, Ki 67, vascular endothelial growth factor, cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX- 2) and cleaved cytokeratin 18 (c-CK 18). Also, fibro-inflammatory alterations after treatment were evaluated. RESULTS: Pre-operative (chemo) radiotherapy caused fibro-inflammatory changes, a downregulation of proliferation (Ki 67) and EGFR and an upregulation of apoptosis (cleaved CK 18). Patients with a good regression during <b>pre-operative</b> <b>treatment</b> showed less proliferating and apoptotic cells in the resection specimen.

In {{order to increase}} the proportion of cases which have undergone radical resection or have reduced the recurrence rate, different <b>pre-operative</b> <b>treatments</b> have introduced. Here, we have verified an active preoperative chemotherapeutic regimen in locally advanced gastric cancer patients. Methods: Forty nine patients who have found eligible to enter this phase 2 trial have treated with oxaliplatin 100 mg/m 2 IV, docetaxel 50 mg/m 2 IV, plus capecitabine 625 mg/m 2 PO (TOX).

Results: Anemia (10. 2 %), nausea (10. 2 %) and vomiting (6. 1 %) were the most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse effects. Regarding the pathologic staging, 6 patients (12. 2 %) had complete response (95 % CI 3 % to 21. 4 %), 18 of them (36. 7 %) had partial response (95 % CI 23. 2 % to 50. 2 %), then 3 patients (6. 1 %) had stable disease (95 % CI 0 %- 12. 8 %).

We report our experience {{with the addition of}} oxaliplatin to radiotherapy and FU in the <b>pre-operative</b> <b>treatment</b> of patients with rectal cancer. Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (cT 3 -T 4 and/or N+) were treated with pre-operative 5 -FU (200 mg/m(2) /day, continuous infusion) and external beam radiation (45 Gy given to large fields plus a booster dose of 5. 4 Gy, making a total of 50 A Gy delivered in 28 daily fractions of 1. 8 Gy). Oxaliplatin was given at a dose of 50 mg/m(2) in 2 h once weekly. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients were standard and written informed consent was obtained before treatment. Surgery was planned 5 weeks after radiotherapy. Toxicity was graded using the NCI-CTC version 3. Oxaliplatin was suspended in cases of G 3 haematological toxicity or G 2 neurotoxicity; both oxaliplatin and FU were Suspended for G 3 non-haematological toxicity. From November 2006 to January 2008, 21 patients were treated. All completed radiation treatment, and 16 received full dose chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was suspended due to G 3 diarrhoea in 3 patients. We observed G 2 - 3 proctitis in 11 patients (particularly painful in three), G 1 allergic reactions in 3 of them and G 1 neurotoxicity in 12. Fifteen patients were operated on.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the role of the myocardial redox state in the development of in-hospital complications after cardiac surgery and the effect of statins on the myocardial redox state. BACKGROUND: Statins improve clinical outcome after cardiac surgery, but it is unclear whether they exert their effects by modifying the myocardial redox state. METHODS: We quantified myocardial superoxide anion (O(2) (-)) and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) and their enzymatic sources in samples of the right atrial appendage (RAA) from 303 patients undergoing cardiac surgery who were followed up until discharge, and in 42 patients who were randomized to receive 3 -day treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/d or placebo before surgery. The mechanisms by which atorvastatin modifies myocardial redox state were investigated in 26 RAA samples that were exposed to atorvastatin ex vivo. RESULTS: Atrial O(2) (-) (derived mainly from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NADPH] oxidases) and ONOO(-) were independently associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation, the need for post-operative inotropic support, and the length of hospital stay. <b>Pre-operative</b> atorvastatin <b>treatment</b> suppressed atrial NADPH oxidase activity and myocardial O(2) (-) and ONOO(-) production. Ex vivo incubation of RAA samples with atorvastatin induced a mevalonate-reversible and Rac 1 -mediated inhibition of NADPH oxidase. CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong independent association between myocardial O(2) (-) /ONOO(-) and in-hospital complications after cardiac surgery. Both myocardial O(2) (-) and ONOO(-) are reduced by <b>pre-operative</b> statin <b>treatment,</b> through a Rac 1 -mediated suppression of NADPH oxidase activity. These findings suggest that inhibition of myocardial NADPH oxidases may contribute to the beneficial effect of statins in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

40|$|SUMMARY: We {{report on}} our {{experience}} with the intra-arterial administration of eptifibatide for thrombolysis during aneurysm-embolization procedures. In 4 cases (3 stent-assisted coiling proce-dures and 1 with posthemorrhagic vasospasm), we noted the formation of thrombus occluding a vessel. We administered eptifibatide (10 – 15 mg) through a microcatheter proximal to the thrombus. The thrombus rapidly dissolved, resulting in the recanalization of the occluded vessels with no rethrombosis or hemorrhagic complications. Thrombus formation is a common and severe complicationof neurovascular interventions. It can lead to partial or total occlusion of vascular branches and may result in tran-sient or permanent neurologic symptoms. Many protocols have been proposed to avoid this compli-cation (heparinized saline drip, systemic heparinization, <b>pre-operative</b> antiplatelet <b>treatment,</b> intraoperative antiplatelet intravenous administration).

The proliferative index was determined in a prospective series of 132 pituitary tumours {{as the percentage of}} monoclonal antibody MiB- 1 -immunopositive cells and referred to as the MIB- 1 labelling index (LI). Its distribution was analysed according to both univariate and multivariate models. A life-threatening pituitary tumour is presented separately. The mean LI was 1. 24 +/- 1. 59 %, with significant differences between clinically secreting (CS) and clinically non-secreting (CNS) adenomas. In CS adenomas (n = 65), LI was highly variable and markedly influenced by pre-operative pharmacological treatment (0. 80 +/- 1. 03 vs 2. 06 +/- 2. 39 % in treated vs untreated cases, P = 0. 009); it decreased with patient's age (P = 0. 025, r = 0. 28) and increased with tumour volume and invasiveness.

The analysis was performed and applied within the framework of the ulipristal acetate submission for reimbursement in 2012. Methods: A decision model was developed to compare the total costs of ulipristal acetate compared to leuprolide, the standard care in The Netherlands. The target population of this study corresponded to the type of patients included in the PEARL II clinical trial; i. e. women of reproductive age requiring <b>pre-operative</b> <b>treatment</b> for uterine fibroids. Sensitivity analysis was implemented to assess uncertainties. Data regarding costs, effects, and other input parameters were obtained from relevant published literatures, the Dutch Healthcare Insurance Board, and expert opinion obtained by means of a panel of experts from several medical centers in The Netherlands. Results: In The Netherlands, the total costs of ulipristal acetate and leuprolide were estimated at Euro 4, 216, 027 and Euro 4, 218, 095, respectively. The annual savings of ulipristal acetate were, therefore, estimated at Euro 2, 068. The major driver of this cost difference was the cost of administration for leuprolide. Sensitivity analyses showed that ulipristal acetate mostly remained cost-saving over a range of assumptions. The budget impact analysis indicated that the introduction of ulipristal acetate was estimated to result in cost savings in the first 3 years following the introduction. The results of this study were used in the decision on reimbursement of ulipristal acetate according to the Dutch Reference Pricing system in 2012.

Establishing the prognostic significance of local and systemic inflammation and tissue necrosis scoring systems in BPH may elucidate the potential of inflammatory pathways as a target of therapeutic intervention in these patients. Patients and Methods: Consecutive patients with histological BPH diagnosed between 1996 and 2005 were identified. Systemic inflammation was assessed by the modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS), local inflammation by the Klintrup-Makinen criteria and tissue necrosis was evaluated by an extent-based classification. Results: In 392 BPH patients, there was a trend for increased local inflammation and tissue necrosis to be associated with shorter time to failure of <b>pre-operative</b> medical <b>treatment</b> of BPH (p = 0. 096 and 0. 088, respectively).

However, the responsiveness of monocytes to Toll-like receptor (TLR) -mediated activation decreases throughout the postoperative course. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the major signaling pathway involved in plasma-mediated inhibition of LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -a production by monocytes. Methodology/Principal Findings: Pediatric patients that underwent CPB-assisted surgical correction of simple congenital heart defects were enrolled (n = 38). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma samples were isolated at consecutive time points. Patient plasma samples were added back to monocytes obtained pre-operatively for ex vivo LPS stimulations and TNF-a and IL- 6 production was measured by flow cytometry. LPS-induced p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF) -kB activation by patient plasma was assessed by Western blotting. A cell-permeable peptide inhibitor was used to block STAT 3 signaling. We found that plasma samples obtained 4 h after surgery, regardless of <b>pre-operative</b> dexamethasone <b>treatment,</b> potently inhibited LPS-induced TNF-a but not IL- 6 synthesis by monocytes.

We report {{our experience}} {{in the treatment of}} 13 thymic carcinomas. Methods: Thirteen patients with histologically confirmed thymic carcinoma were treated from June 1989. Six patients underwent surgery, followed by adjuvant therapy. Seven patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by surgery and post-operative radiotherapy. Results: The diagnosis of thymic carcinoma was achieved in six cases by a mediastinotomy, in three cases by a ultrasound-guided or a CT-guided fine needle aspiration and in three cases the pre-operative diagnosis was thymoma. In one case we did not have the histological diagnosis. All seven patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy responded. The surgical resection was complete in seven cases. Eight patients are still alive 8 - 142 months from the diagnosis, and six are disease-free. Conclusions: Our experience supports the role of surgery and post-operative radiotherapy in thymic carcinomas. <b>Pre-operative</b> <b>treatment</b> of such neoplasms by multi-drug chemotherapy may improve the resectability and the survival rate.

40|$|A {{technique}} of independent lung anaesthesia {{was used to}} control secretions in severely wet lung cases undergoing lung surgery. A Carlens tube was used and anaesthesia was separately delivered to each lung using separate connections. The two lungs could be independently inflated and aspirated, and dissemination of secretions could thus be prevented. Because of the new antibiotics, {{the number of patients}} with copious amounts of secretions has diminished. Among our chest cases, however, the number of severely wet lung cases who come to operation is by no means low (El-Heneidy and Ashba, 1963). This is mainly due to the chronicity of these cases and the resistance of <b>pre-operative</b> infection to <b>treatment.</b> The result is that these patients, mainly suffering from bronchiectasis and lung abscess, still produce and retain excessiv...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{associated}} end-stage liver {{diseases are}} the leading causes of liver transplantation (LT) in Taiwan. Relapse of hepatitis B occurs after LT, raising the risk of graft failure and reducing patient survival. Although several oral antiviral agents have been approved for anti-HBV treatment, lamivudine (LAM) remained {{to be the most}} widely used preventive regimen in Taiwan. While several clinical predictors have been identified for hepatitis B relapse, the predictive roles of the histopathological characteristics in liver explants as well as the genotypic features of the viruses in pre-LT serum samples have not been assessed. Between September 2002 and August 2009, 150 consecutive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive patients undergoing LT were included for outcome analysis following assessment of the clinicopathological and virological factors prior to LT. Kaplan-Meier analyses discovered that <b>pre-operative</b> LAM <b>treatment</b> # 3 months; membranous distribution and higher expression of tissue HBsAg in liver explants; preoperative viral load § 10 6 copies/ml; and presence of large fragment (. 100 base pairs) pre-S deletion (LFpreSDel) correlated significantly with hepatitis B relapse. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the presence of LFpreSDel (P = 0. 001) and viral load § 10 6 copies/mL (P = 0. 023) were independent predictors for hepatitis B relapse. In conclusion, besides high viral load, LFpreSDel mutation is an important independent predictor for hepatitis B relapse after LT. More aggressive preventiv...|$|R
40|$|Infected {{nonunion}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} challenging orthopaedic complications to manage. There is considerable morbidity associated with infected nonunion. There is significant impact on the life of the patient; social, financial, physical, and mental. Infected nonunion may be a limb-threatening complication. Significant progress has been made in the management of infected nonunion in the last decade. There are clear guidelines for <b>pre-operative</b> evaluation and <b>treatment</b> strategy. The recommended strategy is the ‘infection-elimination first’ strategy. This strategy involves two steps: control of infection by local radical debridement of dead tissue followed by reconstruction. There are four operative techniques (with considerable overlap among them) which have been used in the past decade: Ilizarov, intramedullary devices with or without the use of external fixator, free tissue transfer, and in situ reconstruction. Bone results are, in general, better compared to functional results. Overall, the outcome following treatment of infected nonunion are good to excellent...|$|R
