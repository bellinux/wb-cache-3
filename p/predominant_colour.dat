40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{whether a particular}} palette of colours is used by graphic designers for fiction book covers in the Romance, Science Fiction, and Mystery/Thriller genres. The results show that in the Romance genre the <b>predominant</b> cover <b>colours</b> were skin tone (43 %), peach (20 %), brown/black (18 %) and mid red/brown (10 %). In the Science Fiction genre there were five predominant colours: almost black (35 %), light off-pink (20 %), mid off grey (15 %), light grey blue (15 %), and mid brown/orange (10 %). The Mystery/Thriller genre covers had four predominant colours: skin tone (40 %), almost black (20 %), mushroom (10 %) and mid grey (10 %). Overall, for all genres, the statistical analysis revealed that there were numerous {{significant differences between the}} genres for these <b>predominant</b> <b>colours</b> and that the <b>predominant</b> <b>colours</b> included both low and high lightness colours, but very few high saturation colours.

25|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} the jersey that Kerry wore {{in the first of}} the three games of the 1903 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final series with Kildare, but both accounts agree that the <b>predominant</b> <b>colour</b> was red. One account says that it was a red jersey with green neck and cuffs, which were the colours of the Tralee Mitchels junior football team. Another account says that it was an entirely red jersey with no green in it. The reason that Kerry wore this red or mainly red jersey was that a new set of green and gold jerseys was not delivered in time for the game. For the later games in the 1903 series of games, Kerry wore green jerseys with gold on the cuffs and over the shoulders. These were the colours of the Tralee Mitchels senior team.|$|E

25|$|Cockatoo {{species have}} a mobile crest of {{feathers}} {{on the top}} of their heads, which they can raise for display, and retract. No other parrots can do so, but the Pacific lorikeets in the genera Vini and Phigys can ruffle the feathers of the crown and nape, and the red-fan parrot (or hawk-headed parrot) has a prominent feather neck frill that it can raise and lower at will. The <b>predominant</b> <b>colour</b> of plumage in parrots is green, though most species have some red or another colour in small quantities. Cockatoos are the main exception to this, having lost the green and blue plumage colours in their evolutionary history; they are now predominately black or white with some red, pink, or yellow. Strong sexual dimorphism in plumage is not typical among parrots, with some notable exceptions, the most striking being the eclectus parrot. However {{it has been shown that}} some parrot species exhibit sexually dimorphic plumage in the ultraviolet spectrum, normally invisible to humans.|$|E
25|$|The British army uniform had red jackets or {{doublets}} as a colour {{having been}} established during the Elizabethan times. By the 1660s red {{had become the}} <b>predominant</b> <b>colour</b> in British uniforms since {{the creation of the}} New Model Army in 1645. The regiment of infantry or horse was usually just designated as a regiment number, and not by the name of the colonel as was custom at the time. The first colonel was Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin, who also commanded the British Brigade in the early stages. In 1662 he was succeeded, by the Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg in 1663 who was sent as military adviser to Lisbon with the secret approval of Charles II. Louis XIV of France, in order not to infringe the treaty just made with Spain, deprived Schomberg of his French officers. In the field, however, the regiment was commanded by Michael Dongan, later by Lawrence Dempsey and finally by Frederick's son Meinhardt Schomberg. The first infantry regiment was commanded by Henry Pearson while the second infantry regiment was commanded by James Apsley as colonel, and also Francis Moore as acting colonel. In 1665 the 2nd regiment was commanded by William Sheldon.|$|E

500|$|Fueled by {{the success}} of the Jurassic Park film and the {{popularity}} of dinosaurs with younger audiences, who would grow up to be fans of the franchise, the team's first logo originally featured an aggressive-looking, red velociraptor dribbling a basketball (albeit reminiscent of Jurassic Parks featherless depiction of the creatures, rather than the actual, now believed to be feathered dromaeosaurid). The team's original colours were purple, bright red, black and [...] "Naismith silver" [...] (in honour of the Canadian inventor of basketball, James Naismith). The logo proved to be very popular among fans, as by the end of 1994, the Raptors were seventh in the league in merchandise sales.

6000|$|The fire blazed cheerfully. Mrs. Grizel's {{attention}} {{had left}} some fresh wood, should he choose to continue it, and the apartment had a comfortable, {{though not a}} lively appearance.

Others, with boar-spears, swords, and old-fashioned guns, were attacking stags or boars whom they had brought to bay. The branches of the woven forest were crowded with fowls of various kinds, each depicted with its proper plumage.

60|$|A {{couple of}} hours after Sunset Michael Robartes {{returned}} {{and told me that}} I would have to learn the steps of an exceedingly antique dance, because before my initiation could be perfected I had to join three times in a magical dance, for rhythm was the wheel of Eternity, on which alone the transient and accidental could be broken, and the spirit set free. I found that the steps, which were simple enough, resembled certain antique Greek dances, and having been a good dancer in my youth and the master of many curious Gaelic steps, I soon had them in my memory. He then robed me and himself in a costume which suggested by its shape both Greece and Egypt, but by its crimson colour a more passionate life than theirs; and having put into my hands a little chainless censer of bronze, wrought into the likeness of a rose, by some modern craftsman, he told me to open a small door opposite to the door by which I had entered. I put my hand to the handle, but the moment I did so the fumes of the incense, helped perhaps by his mysterious glamour, made me fall again into a dream, in which I seemed to be a mask, lying on the counter of a little Eastern shop. Many persons, with eyes so bright and still that I knew them for more than human, came in and tried me on their faces, but at last flung me into a corner with a little laughter; but all this passed in a moment, for when I awoke my hand was still upon the handle. I opened the door, and found myself in a marvellous passage, along whose sides were many divinities wrought in a mosaic, not less beautiful than the mosaic in the Baptistery at Ravenna, but of a less severe beauty; the <b>predominant</b> <b>colour</b> of each divinity, which was surely a symbolic colour, being repeated in the lamps that hung from the ceiling, a curiously-scented lamp before every divinity. I passed on, marvelling exceedingly how these enthusiasts could have created all this beauty in so remote a place, and half persuaded to believe in a material alchemy, by the sight of so much hidden wealth; the censer filling the air, as I passed, with smoke of ever-changing colour.|$|E
