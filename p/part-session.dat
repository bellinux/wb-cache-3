500|$|Each {{year the}} {{activities}} of the Parliament cycle between committee weeks where reports are discussed in committees and interparliamentary delegations meet, political group weeks for members to discuss work within their political groups and session weeks where members spend 3½ days in Strasbourg for <b>part-sessions.</b> In addition six 2-day <b>part-sessions</b> are organised in Brussels throughout the year. Four weeks are allocated as constituency week to allow members to do exclusively constituency work. Finally there are no meetings planned during the summer weeks. The Parliament has the power to meet without being convened by another authority. Its meetings are partly controlled by the treaties but are otherwise up to Parliament according to its own [...] "Rules of Procedure" [...] (the regulations governing the parliament).|$|R
50|$|In 2002, Joseph Daul was {{appointed}} {{chairman of the}} Conference of Committee Chairmen, {{which is responsible for}} coordinating 'horizontal' issues affecting the 20 parliamentary committees and for preparing the draft agenda for the plenary <b>part-sessions.</b> As part of the reform of the European Parliament, the Conference put forward proposals for making its work more efficient. Daul also co-chaired, together with the committee chairmen concerned, the hearings of the Commissioners and transmitted the conclusions to the President of the European Parliament.|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} after {{the celebration of the}} Council of Europe's 25th anniversary in 1964 that the Rules of Procedure of the Consultative Assembly (its name was not changed to Parliamentary Assembly until 1974) discreetly {{mentioned}} that members had the possibility of forming political groups. The history of the liberal group in the PACE dates back to early 1970s (first documented in 1974). At the time it was called the Liberal Group and consisted of 30 members headed by Frederik Portheine (Netherlands). The Group held only one meeting during the week of the Strasbourg <b>part-sessions.</b>|$|R
25|$|After the war, Luxembourg {{ended its}} neutrality, {{and became a}} {{founding}} member of several inter-governmental and supra-governmental institutions. In 1952, the city became the headquarters of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community. In 1967, the High Authority was merged with the commissions of the other European institutions; although Luxembourg City was no longer the seat of the ECSC, it hosted some <b>part-sessions</b> of the European Parliament until 1981. Luxembourg remains the seat of the European Parliament's secretariat, as well as the European Court of Justice, the European Court of Auditors, and the European Investment Bank. Several departments of the European Commission are also based in Luxembourg.|$|R
5|$|Despite the 1965 agreement, the Parliament's seat {{remained}} {{a source of}} contention. Wishing {{to be closer to}} the activities in Brussels and Luxembourg, a few plenary sessions were held by the Parliament between 1967 and 1981 in Luxembourg instead of Strasbourg—against the wishes of France—and in 1981 it returned to holding sessions entirely in Strasbourg. In the previous year it unsuccessfully issued an ultimatum to the national governments, attempting to force them to reach an agreement. Thus, the Parliament moved some of its decision-making bodies to Brussels, along with its committee and political group meetings, and in 1985 it also built a plenary chamber in Brussels for some <b>part-sessions.</b> All the Parliament's attempts in this field were challenged by member states.|$|R
2500|$|However, the 1965 {{agreement}} {{was a source}} of contention for the Parliament, which wished to be closer to the other institutions, so it began moving some of its decision making bodies, committee and political group meetings to Brussels. In 1983 it went further by symbolically holding a plenary session in Brussels, {{in the basement of the}} Mont des Arts Congress Centre. However the meeting was a fiasco and the poor facilities partly discredited Brussels' aim of being the sole seat of the institutions. Things looked up for Brussels when Parliament gained its own plenary chamber in Brussels (on Rue Wiertzstraat) in 1985 for some of its <b>part-sessions.</b> This was done unofficially due to the sensitive nature of the Parliament's seat, with the building being constructed under the name of an [...] "international conference centre". When France unsuccessfully challenged Parliament's half-move to Brussels in the Court of Justice, Parliament's victory led it to build full facilities in Brussels.|$|R
