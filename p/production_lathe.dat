50|$|While in Sawbridgeworth, Cosby married Josephine Collins, the {{daughter}} of a local doctor. In the 1920s Cosby was frustrated by poor quality lathes available and resolved to produce his own design for a cheap but effective <b>production</b> <b>lathe</b> with pneumatically actuated headstock and tailstock and its own electric drive. In 1929 he was trading as Smallpeice Ltd, and moved the company to Foleshill Rd, Coventry where he shared premises with Cromwell Engineering. The collaboration allowed the production in 1929 of the Smallpeice Multicut <b>production</b> <b>lathe.</b> There was also a precision lathe marketed under the Cromwell name, and Smallpeice continued in the development of pneumatic aids to production, and apart from premises in Mile Lane in Coventry he had a drawing office in the village of Marton.|$|E

The problem that often arises is located on the lathe and miling production waste that is not managed properly. With the utilization of waste material <b>production</b> (<b>lathe</b> and miling) in a way that uses recycled foundry technology, it can overcome the problem. In a propeller foundry process as for things to note are from preparing materials and equipment used, followed by molding to the casting to the finishing process. After the casting process is completed, the testing of hardness and impack test aims to determine the strength and toughness of a propeller. From the data obtained during the test, the average values obtained Impack price 1. 78 j/mm 2 and the average rate on test equipment Rockwell hardness 69. 95 HRB which means the blades that have been tested have high levels of violence and has the power good energy absorption while receiving collision.

50|$|Computer {{numerical}} controlled (CNC) lathes {{are rapidly}} replacing the older <b>production</b> <b>lathes</b> (multispindle, etc.) {{due to their}} ease of setting, operation, repeatability and accuracy. They are designed to use modern carbide tooling and fully use modern processes. The part may be designed and the tool paths programmed by the CAD/CAM process or manually by the programmer, and the resulting file uploaded to the machine, and once set and trialled the machine will continue to turn out parts under the occasional supervision of an operator.|$|R

50|$|<b>Production</b> <b>lathes</b> were {{obviously}} of key {{importance in the}} war years, however on 14 November 1940 the Smallpeice and Cromwell factories in Coventry were completely destroyed by a large air-raid. Production of the Multicut lathe was resumed by a relationship with Alfred Herbert Ltd, as the Herbert-Smallpeice Lathe. While, {{in the village of}} Marton, work continued on pneumatic devices, and the company Martonair was formed. A new product, the Martonair pneumatic hoist, found a strong market in wartime factories due to the large proportion of women involved in production. In 1941 the head office was moved to a disused dance hall in Parkshot near Richmond, Surrey. While Martonair thrived, Cosby was working on a new precision lathe, something now in short supply. The design was put out to tender in December 1944, and the first lathe was produced for Smallpeice Ltd by J Evans & Sons of Portsmouth in October 1945 (though at the time they were in Frome, where they had been relocated during the war).|$|R

The size of the micro cutting system is so small that the working situation must be observed under an optical microscope. Circular bar of 0. 3 mm in diameter is cramped and rotated with little eccentricity. Several materials such as copper, brass and Ti are cut into the minimum size of about 10 μ m in diameter.

40|$|A Reconstructive Explanation tool {{has been}} {{developed}} and implemented within an integrated knowledge acquisition framework. This tool (RIETO) employs both a formal and an informal knowledge base to construct explanations for individual <b>lathe</b> <b>production</b> plans. RIETO adopts a reconstructive explanation approach [WickThompson 92] which does not rely on the problem solving trace constructed by the inference component of the system. Instead it reconstructs possible lines of reasoning which may provide justifications for those aspects of the solution which are questioned by the user. The explanation tool can thus bring to bear all pertinent information which was captured during knowledge acquisition, {{even if it was}} not used for actually solving the problem. RIETO can answer "why?" and "why not?" questions about different aspects of the production plan, can give justifications for rules and provide all information about a particular topic (e. g. the selection of cutting materials) which is pertinent to {{the context in which the}} question is asked by the user...|$|R
40|$|The paper settles a {{research}} branch {{in the realm}} of logic-oriented, hybrid knowledge representation. Terminological knowledge representation and reasoning can now be utilized for more realistic applications as an integral component of a computationally complete, declarative hybrid knowledge representation formalism with integrated special-purpose reasoners of concrete domains such as real-closed fields or finite-domain constraints. The paper presents technical results exploring the impact of "role interaction" on the decidability of the subsumption problem of terminological logics. In particular, decision procedures are presented for common reasoning problems in an expressive terminological logic that is parametrized by a concrete domain. A refined minimal belief logic which avoids certain problems concerning the non-propositional case (which ocurred surprisingly) is the basis of the model-theoretic semantics of a very general generic rule formalism integrating goal-directed (i. e., top-down) and data-driven (i. e., bottom-up) reasoning in a declarative manner. A mechanical engineering application (<b>production</b> planning of <b>lathes)</b> is used to demonstrate how the theoretical results can be employed in realistic applications...|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{theoretical}} {{analysis of the}} production of worm gears and also the calculation of the tool cutting edges for their production. Based on the design parameters of worm and worm wheel, {{it is possible to}} calculate the coordinates of the shape of the tool cutting edge. The exact calculation of the coordinates or parameters requires mathematical formulations and applying mathematical relationships we can transform the design of worm screw profile to the profile of tool. Worms of different types can be produced in various ways, e. g. with a lathe and the plane to set a tool is either axial or normal. In this article we consider their <b>production</b> on the <b>lathe</b> and tool setting in the normal plane. Axial profile of worm is a curve which is the intersection of worm surface and the plane passing through its axis, and normal profile is perpendicular in a selected point to worm profile. This normal profile in more accurately way characterizes the shape of the worm profile, therefore, the calculation of the shape of the tool cutting edge is designed with a tool set to the normal plane. Based on the analyses, the new computation equations were obtained, flowchart compiled and, according to a given regulation, the computer aided calculation of the coordinates can be implemented...|$|R
