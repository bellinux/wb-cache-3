The focus was on weather and astrometry observations that included the first systematic measurements of atmospheric <b>pressure,</b> <b>temperature,</b> <b>humidity</b> and rainfall. He made astrometric observations to determine legal time and {{as well as the}} latitude of the Observatory. Buscalioni worked to establish contacts with the best observatories and astronomers of America and Europe. Buscalioni led the observatory for three years, submitting his final report in January 1894. He left Venezuela soon after with a severe illness and died shortly after arriving back in Italy.|$|E
5000|$|Francis Ronalds invented many meteorological, {{magnetic}} {{and electrical}} instruments at Kew, which saw long-term use around the world. These included {{the first successful}} cameras in 1845 to record the variations of parameters such as atmospheric <b>pressure,</b> <b>temperature,</b> <b>humidity,</b> atmospheric electricity and geomagnetism through the day and night. [...] His photo-barograph was used by Robert Fitzroy from 1862 in making the UK’s first official weather forecasts at the Meteorological Office. The network of observing stations set-up in 1867 by the Met Office to assist in understanding the weather was equipped with his cameras - some of these remained in use at Kew until the observatory’s closure in 1980.|$|E
5000|$|On {{his return}} to the UK in 1833 he went up to Magdalen Hall, Oxford, graduating MA in 1839. He then served as {{director}} of the Radcliffe Observatory from 1839 until his death in Oxford in 1859. He introduced there self-registering meteorological instruments to continuously record variations in atmospheric <b>pressure,</b> <b>temperature,</b> <b>humidity</b> and atmospheric electricity using the recent invention of photography. The initial instruments were invented and installed by Francis Ronalds, Honorary Director of the Kew Observatory. [...] The Radcliffe Observatory later became part of the network of observing stations established as part of the new Meteorological Office and coordinated from Kew. [...] Johnson was president of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1855-1857 and was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1856.|$|E

50|$|Rayleigh waves {{propagating}} at high ultrasonic frequencies (10-1000 MHz) {{are used}} widely in different electronic devices. In addition to Rayleigh waves, some {{other types of}} surface acoustic waves (SAW), e.g. Love waves, are also used for this purpose. Examples of electronic devices using Rayleigh waves are filters, resonators, oscillators, sensors of <b>pressure,</b> <b>temperature,</b> <b>humidity,</b> etc. Operation of SAW devices {{is based on the}} transformation of the initial electric signal into a surface wave that, after achieving the required changes to the spectrum of the initial electric signal {{as a result of its}} interaction with different types of surface inhomogeneity, is transformed back into a modified electric signal. The transformation of the initial electric energy into mechanical energy (in the form of SAW) and back is usually accomplished via the use of piezoelectric materials for both generation and reception of Rayleigh waves as well as for their propagation.|$|E
50|$|Instrumentation {{is defined}} as the art and science of {{measurement}} and control of the process variables within a production or manufacturing area. The process variables used in industries are Level, <b>Pressure,</b> <b>Temperature,</b> <b>Humidity,</b> Flow, pH, Force, Speed etc.Control engineering or control systems engineering is the engineering discipline that applies control theory to design systems with desired behaviors. Control engineers are responsible for the research, design, development and control devices/systems, typically in manufacturing facilities and plants. The practice uses sensors to measure the output performance of the device being controlled and those measurements can be used to give feedback to the input actuators that can make corrections toward desired performance. When a device is designed to perform without the need of human inputs for correction it is called automatic control (such as cruise control for regulating a car's speed). Multi-disciplinary in nature, control systems engineering activities focus on implementation of control systems mainly derived by mathematical modeling of systems of a diverse range.|$|E
50|$|Isolines {{are drawn}} on maps of such climatic {{features}} as the long-term mean values (of atmospheric <b>pressure,</b> <b>temperature,</b> <b>humidity,</b> total precipitation, and so forth) to connect points with equal {{values of the}} feature in question—for example, isobars for pressure, isotherms for temperature, and isohyets for precipitation. Isoamplitudes are drawn on maps of amplitudes (for example, annual amplitudes of air temperature—that is, {{the differences between the}} mean temperatures of the warmest and coldest month). Isanomals are drawn on maps of anomalies (for example, deviations of the mean temperature of each place from the mean temperature of the entire latitudinal zone). Isolines of frequency are drawn on maps showing the frequency of a particular phenomenon (for example, annual number of days with a thunderstorm or snow cover). Isochrones are drawn on maps showing the dates of onset of a given phenomenon (for example, the first frost and appearance or disappearance of the snow cover) or the date of a particular value of a meteorological element {{in the course of a}} year (for example, passing of the mean daily air temperature through zero). Isolines of the mean numerical value of wind velocity or isotachs are drawn on wind maps (charts); the wind resultants and directions of prevailing winds are indicated by arrows of different length or arrows with different plumes; lines of flow are often drawn. Maps of the zonal and meridional components of wind are frequently compiled for the free atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure and wind are usually combined on climatic maps. Wind roses, curves showing the distribution of other meteorological elements, diagrams of the annual course of elements at individual stations, and the like are also plotted on climatic maps.|$|E
