40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{perceptions of}} acceptable conducts amongst under and postgraduate optometry {{students and to}} compare them with students from other disciplines. MethodsStudents (under/postgraduate) of optometry (n= 156) and other courses (n= 54) from University of Minho participated in a voluntary online questionnaire about perception of conducts, classifying as acceptable or unacceptable 15 academic or professional scenarios. Results 210 questionnaires were analyzed. Differences in perceptions were found between optometry under and postgraduates in scenario 5, Chi-square(2, 156) = 4. 3, p= 0. 038, and scenario 7, Chi-square(2, 156) = 7. 0, p= 0. 008 (both with cheating more acceptable for postgrads). Differences between under and postgraduates from other courses were found in scenario 9 (taking supplies from classroom more acceptable for undergrads), Chi-square(1, 54) = 5. 0, p= 0. 025, and scenario 14 (forging a signature more acceptable for postgrads), Chi-square(1, 54) = 3. 9, p= 0. 046. Differences between optometry and other courses undergraduates were observed in scenario 2 (plagiarism more acceptable for optometry undergrads), Chi-square(1, 154) = 8. 3, p= 0. 004 and scenario 9 (taking supplies from classroom more acceptable for other undergrads), chi-square(1, 54) = 7. 8, p= 0. 005. Differences between optometry and other courses postgraduates were observed in scenario 7, Chi-square(1, 56) = 5. 8, p= 0. 016, scenario 10 (both with cheating more acceptable for optometry postgrads), chi-square(1, 54) = 8. 1, p= 0. 004 and scenario 14 (forging a signature more acceptable for other postgrads), Chi-square(1, 54) = 6. 1, p= 0. 026. ConclusionAcademic misconducts were mainly considered more acceptable than <b>professional</b> <b>misconducts.</b> Our results show that perceptions of acceptable conducts amongst optometry students are not very different from other students, and, against our initial prediction, do not show a general change in misconduct perception when students become more mature.

The findings of the qualitative study indicate challenges that teachers face {{as a result of their}} dual lives between schools and private tutoring. The challenges include moral dilemmas related to tutoring their students. The paper discusses how private tutoring becomes a âsurvival strategyâ in the education system with low teacher pay, weak accountability system, and lack of monitoring efficacy. It highlights that the widely normalized practice in Georgia of teachers tutoring their students is not necessarily a form of corruption. However, it includes a high risk of corruption because of a thin line existing between teacher <b>professional</b> ethics and <b>misconduct.</b> Understanding how teachers rationalize tutoring their students contributes to the international research agenda by exploring teachers' perspectives on private tutoring, and offers insights into what constitutes teacher corruption in post-Soviet Georgia, making an important contribution to the international scholarship on educational corruption.

500|$|Prince Albert Victor died in 1892, but society {{gossip about}} his sex life continued. Sixty {{years after the}} scandal the {{official}} biographer of King George V, Harold Nicolson, was told by Lord Goddard, who was a twelve-year-old schoolboy {{at the time of}} the scandal, that Prince Albert Victor [...] "had been involved in a male brothel scene, and that a solicitor had to commit perjury to clear him. The solicitor was struck off the rolls for his offence, but was thereafter reinstated." [...] In fact, none of the lawyers involved in the case was convicted of perjury or struck off at the time, indeed most had very distinguished careers. However, Arthur Newton was struck off for 12 months for <b>professional</b> <b>misconduct</b> in 1910 after falsifying letters from another of his clients—the notorious murderer Harvey Crippen. In 1913, he was struck off indefinitely and sentenced to three years' imprisonment for obtaining money by false pretences. Newton may have invented and spread the rumours about Prince Albert Victor in an attempt to protect his clients from prosecution by forcing a cover-up. State papers on the case in the Public Record Office, released to the public in the 1970s, provide no information on the prince's involvement other than Newton's threat to implicate him. Hamilton Cuffe wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Augustus Stephenson, [...] "I am told that Newton has boasted that if we go on a very distinguished person will be involved (PAV). I don't mean to say that I for one instant credit it—but in such circumstances as this one never knows what may be said, be concocted or be true." [...] Surviving private letters from Somerset to his friend Lord Esher, confirm that Somerset knew of the rumours but did not know if they were true. He writes, [...] "I can quite understand the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son's name being coupled with the thing... we were both accused of going to this place but not together... I wonder if it is really a fact or only an invention." [...] In his correspondence, Sir Dighton Probyn refers to [...] "cruel and unjust rumours with regard to PAV" [...] and [...] "false reports dragging PAV's name into the sad story". When Prince Albert Victor's name appeared in the American press, the New York Herald published an anonymous letter, almost certainly written by Charles Hall, saying [...] "there is not, and never was, the slightest excuse for mentioning the name of Prince Albert Victor."
