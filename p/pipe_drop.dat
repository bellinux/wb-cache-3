40|$|AbstractDrops {{are used}} to {{effectively}} dissipate the surplus energy of the water flow. A closed conduit drop conveys water and stills it at its downstream. I-type <b>pipe</b> <b>drop</b> is one kind of the closed conduit drops which is used in irrigation networks as a typical hydraulic structure. Sump elevation is an important design parameter for I-type <b>pipe</b> <b>drop.</b> Similarly, in supercritical flow structures, such as open channel chutes, determination of stilling basin invert elevation is very important. At present, these key design parameters {{are determined by the}} momentum and energy equations using tedious trial-and-error procedure. In this study, square conduit drop, <b>pipe</b> <b>drop,</b> and rectangular stilling basin are considered, and three explicit equations have been developed by (multiple) nonlinear regression technique to determine the sump and stilling basin invert elevations. Being very simple and accurate, these equations can be easily used to design the closed conduit drops and stilling basins by hydraulic engineers...|$|E

50|$|At {{approximately}} 4:45 in {{the afternoon}} on July 8, 1892, a <b>pipe</b> <b>dropped</b> in Timothy O'Brien's stable at Freshwater Road {{at the top of}} Carter's Hill began what would become the worst fire in St. John's history. Initially, the fire did not cause any widespread panic, however a series of catastrophic coincidences caused the fire to spread and devour virtually all of the east end of the city, including much of its major commercial area before being extinguished.|$|R

5000|$|Blumberg {{has been}} {{featured}} on several television programs, including CBS Eyewitness News and the National Geographic Channel show [...] "Naked Science" [...] {{to discuss a}} new methodology for weakening hurricanes {{by as much as}} a category. The proposed system uses thousands of <b>pipes</b> <b>dropped</b> into the ocean that would transport cold water up to the surface by the pressure of waves and thus reduce the temperature on the ocean's surface by 1-3 degrees. Such a temperature drop would be enough to chill a storm to save lives and reduce damage.|$|R
5000|$|Offshore {{storms and}} pipes: As large waves pass over shallowly buried pipes, water {{pressure}} increases above it. As the trough approaches, pressure over the <b>pipe</b> <b>drops</b> and this sudden and repeated variation in pressure can break pipes. The difference in pressure for a wave with wave height of about 10 m would be equivalent to one atmosphere (101.3 kPa or 14.7 psi) pressure variation between crest and trough and repeated fluctuations over pipes in relatively shallow environments {{could set up}} resonance vibrations within pipes or structures and cause problems.|$|R
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} main had {{a level of}} a liquid mixture of (initially) water, but, following use, also coal tar, and ammoniacal liquor. Each retort ascension <b>pipe</b> <b>dropped</b> under the water level by at least a small amount, perhaps by an inch, but often considerably more in the earlier days of gas manufacture. The gas evolved from each retort would thus bubble through the liquid and emerge from it into the void above the liquid, where it would mix with the gas evolved from the other retorts and be drawn off through the foul main to the condenser.|$|R

To enjoy the luxury, one wants to fall into a kind of dreamy reverie, only known to the children of the weed. And the very atmosphere of the place, laden as it was with the snores of the sleepers, was inducive of this. No wonder, then, that after a while Bob's head sunk upon his breast; presently his hat fell off, the extinguished <b>pipe</b> <b>dropped</b> from his mouth, and the next moment he lay out on the chest as tranquil as an infant.|$|R

50|$|A Gold Kist {{broiler house}} was usually 30-40 {{feet wide and}} 400-600 feet long. Each may house {{thousands}} of chicks. A farm may contain a number of these; most contain about 4-6 houses.

40|$|The radon {{industry}} typically uses {{plastic piping}} from 2 " to 6 " in diameter in {{the installation of}} active soil depressurization systems (ASD). It is also typical to use 2 " by 3 " or 3 " by 4 " aluminum downspout for exterior piping. In a previous paper, (ref I), the exhaust airflow in 87 NJ ASD mitigation systems was measured {{from a low of}} 11 ch to a high of 167 ch with a median level Of 70 cfin. Fifty-six percent of these systems had air flows between 40 and 90 cfin. These typical air flows can have a large <b>pipe</b> pressure <b>drop</b> because of the system design that will reduce the systems final effectiveness. Most radon mitigators have little idea how much impact changing the pipe size has on their final system performance or how to calculate the <b>pipe</b> pressure <b>drop.</b> This paper discusses the development of a <b>pipe</b> pressure <b>drop</b> calculation for standard mitigation piping and fittings. The formulas for calculating the pressure drop were obtained from the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals (ref 2). Correction factors for these formulas and testing of fittings and piping not included in the Fundamentals were obtained by carefully testing the pressure drops in the range of air flow and pipe sizes previously mentioned. The pressure drop in pvc piping was found to be from 9 % to 23 % less than the ASHRAE calculations. The pressure drop in pvc fittings was found to be from 53 % less to 109 % greater than the ASHRAE calculations. Using the corrected value...|$|R

30|$|The most {{primitive}} Indian families I {{have met}} with paid great attention to keeping alive the fire they possessed, and carried it on their travels in old kettles, fed at frequent intervals by little dry sticks. The means of obtaining fire have been rendered much easier {{by the introduction of}} steel to be used with flint and punk, and of gunpowder by which to ignite rags, &c., in their flint-lock guns, but above all by lucifer matches. The Indian, or for that matter the white man, who is fortunate enough to possess a stock of matches, when in the woods, very often avails himself of this easy means to make a smudge to keep off the mosquitoes, to light his <b>pipe,</b> <b>dropping</b> the burning match, or to make a little fire in order to boil his kettle and refresh himself with a hot drink. The number of fire-setting travellers has greatly increased in comparatively recent times. These include fur traders, missionaries, surveyors, explorers, prospectors, &c. and, nearer to civilization, railway builders, common-road makers, lumbermen, bush-rangers, and sellers.|$|R
50|$|Although the Vanwalls {{went away}} from the grid at the front Behra moved up to second on the first lap. Fangio {{attached}} himself to the train of cars ahead of him and the five began to pull {{away from the}} rest of the field while indulging in a traditional Monza slipstreaming battle which saw the lead constantly changing between Moss and Behra. On lap seven Fangio took the lead but he was soon toppled in favor of Moss, Brooks and then Lewis-Evans. On lap 20 Brooks dropped out of the fight with a sticking throttle. Then Lewis-Evans ran into trouble and pitted. This left Moss in the lead with Fangio and Behra behind him, although Behra would pit soon afterwards for new tires. This moved Schell into third place but he disappeared with an oil leak which meant that third was passed on to Collins. At two-thirds distance Collins ran into engine trouble and pitted. This promoted Hawthorn to third but a split fuel <b>pipe</b> <b>dropped</b> him to sixth in the closing laps, leaving third place to Von Trips.|$|R
60|$|Immediately after supper, {{they all}} lay down to sleep, but, for a time, each {{motionless}} form that lay rolled tightly in its blanket like an Egyptian mummy, sent {{a series of}} little puffs from its head. At last the stars came out, and the <b>pipes</b> <b>dropped</b> from each sleeper's lips. Then the moon rose--a circumstance which rendered their position still more secure--and the fire sank low. But Slugs was too cautious a hunter to trust entirely to the alleged cowardice of the savages. He knew well that many, indeed most of the redskins, bad as well as good, had quite enough of mere brute courage to make them dare and risk {{a good deal for}} the sake of scalping a white hunter, so he rose once or twice during the night to replenish the fire and take a look round; and as often as he rose for these purposes, so often did he observe the glittering eye of the Black Swan glaring round the encampment, although its owner never once moved from his recumbent posture.|$|R
60|$|Entering a shanty, roughly {{built of}} ties and {{galvanized}} iron, {{he found a}} stove burning, and a Chinaman who told him that supper would be ready soon. After a while the men came in and, asking very few questions, gave him a share of their meal; then he was shown a rude bed of fir branches and swamp hay and told he could sleep there. Prescott lay down and lighted his pipe and then looked about for a while. The place was dimly lighted and filled with rank tobacco smoke, through which he saw the blurred figures of his new companions. Some of them were playing cards under a lamp, some were disputing in harsh voices, and now {{and then there was}} a burst of laughter. Once or twice a man went out and an icy draught swept through the shed, but except for that it was delightfully warm. Soon Prescott's <b>pipe</b> <b>dropped</b> from his hand and, failing in a drowsy attempt to find it, he went to sleep.|$|R
50|$|A Gold Kist layer {{house was}} usually 30-40 {{feet wide and}} 400-600 feet long. Each may house about 15,000 birds.

50|$|There are two {{beginner}} areas, {{and many}} intermediate and advanced trails.

The lower field contains the field's single narrow beginner trail, Clarry's Track, and a few other intermediate trails. They also serve as access to the base area from the upper mountain, and are often crowded. The field is 500 ha and has a 722 m vertical drop.|$|R
5000|$|However, on {{units with}} Triple Valves (Distributore tipo Westinghouse) and 7-position levers, braking circuit is {{slightly}} different. The [...] is divided {{in two parts}} like said before, but there isn't the command reservoir tank: when the pressure inside the brake <b>pipe</b> <b>drops,</b> it's directly the auxiliary reservoir that makes the frame put in the middle moving. Braking is not gradual on release in this case: when the driver puts the controller on [...] "release" [...] position, brakes are fully released; if he brakes again too shortly after, there is the risk to have a loss of braking power because {{there may not be}} enough air to brake optimally, since the absence of the fixed pressure of the command reservoir doesn't ensure that there is enough air to safely release the brakes. It is even possible to fully exhaust the reservoir, with the consequent danger to not be able to stop the train at all. This is prevented in units with Breda and other types of valves as the brakes cannot be fully released if there is not enough air in main reservoir tanks to brake again.|$|R
60|$|Harding {{found it}} {{difficult}} to keep still. He slowly filled his pipe for the sake of occupation. The match he struck burned steadily, but its pale flame was suddenly lost in a dazzling glare as the lightning fell in an unbroken fork from overhead to a corner of the bluff. Then the <b>pipe</b> <b>dropped</b> and was trodden on, as the men swayed to and fro, using all their strength to hold the plunging team. It was only for a moment they heard the battering hoofs, for a deafening crash that rolled across the heavens drowned all other sound, and as it died away the trees began to moan. A few large drops of rain fell, and then, as the men watched it, gathering a faint hope, the rain turned to hail. A savage wind struck the bluff, the air got icy cold, and the hail changed from fine grains to ragged lumps. Harding could hear it roar among the trees between the peals of thunder, until the scream of wind and the groan of bending branches joined in and formed a wild tumult of sound.|$|R
