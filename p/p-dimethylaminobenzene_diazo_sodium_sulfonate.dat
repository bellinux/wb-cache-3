40|$|The {{injection}} of dry Ca-based sorbents for removing acid gases had been investigated previously. However, {{the utilization of}} Ca-based sorbents for adsorbing other air pollutants was rarely examined. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the reduction of organic compounds polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) and heavy metals by using the desulfurization sorbents in a dry scrubber integrated with a fabric filter. Four surfactants, calcium lignosulfonate, sodium lignosulfonate, alkyl naphthalene <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfonate</b> and beta-naphthalene <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfonate</b> condensates, were used as additives to modify the surface characteristics of desulfurization sorbent calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) (2)). Modifying the desulfurization sorbents with surfactants showed different effects on removal of PAHs, BTEX, and heavy metals, and exploited the potential of Ca-based sorbents for adsorbing air pollutants other than SO 2.

40|$|Introduction : Previous {{researches}} {{showed that}} neutral soaps significantly increased bond strength and decreased microleakage of dentin bonding agents. The {{aim of this}} study was histopathological evaluation of the effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfonate</b> application as neutral soap on the cat's dental pulp after an ideal composite restorative treatment.   Methods: Ten adult cats with 40 caries-free canine teeth were selected for the study. Class V cavities were prepared in the buccal surfaces of all the teeth. The teeth of the right quadrants were treated with composite, whereas the teeth of the left quadrants were primarily etched, after using of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfonate</b> solution, they treated with composite. The first five cats were killed after one week and the other five cats after one month. The teeth were fixed, decalcified and after being sliced, paraffined blocks were made and microscopic slides were prepared and histologically evaluated. Results: The results of the histological evaluation showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the intensity of inflammation in the pulp of the teeth in the right and left quadrants after one week (P= 1. 000) and one month (P= 0. 773). However, there was significant difference after one week regarding predentin formation (P= 0. 017) and in the teeth of the left quadrants, the formation of predentin was more that the right quadrants, but no meaningful difference was observed after one month (P= 0. 203).    Conclusion: It seems that the <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfonate</b> in composite restorative treatments without fear of damage to the pulp can be used...|$|R
25|$|Preventing {{recurrence}} of hyperkalemia typically involves reduction of dietary potassium, removal of an offending medication, and/or {{the addition of}} a diuretic (such as furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide). <b>Sodium</b> polystyrene <b>sulfonate</b> and sorbitol (combined as Kayexalate) are occasionally used on an ongoing basis to maintain lower serum levels of potassium though the safety of long-term use of <b>sodium</b> polystyrene <b>sulfonate</b> for this purpose is not well understood.|$|R
50|$|The main use of <b>sodium</b> {{2-hydroxyethyl}} <b>sulfonate</b> is {{the production}} of the isethionate class of surfactants.

50|$|Several {{approaches}} {{are used in}} the treatment of hyperkalemia. In October 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved patiromer which works by binding free potassium ions in the gastrointestinal tract and releasing calcium ions for exchange. Previously, the only approved product was <b>sodium</b> polystyrene <b>sulfonate</b> (Kayexalate), an organic ion-exchange resin that nonspecifically binds cations (e.g., calcium, potassium, magnesium) in the gastrointestinal tract. The effectiveness of <b>sodium</b> polystyrene <b>sulfonate</b> has been questioned: a study in healthy subjects showed that laxatives alone were almost as effective in increasing potassium secretion as laxatives plus Kayexalate. In addition, use of <b>sodium</b> polystyrene <b>sulfonate,</b> particularly if formulated with high sorbitol content, is uncommonly but convincingly associated with colonic necrosis.|$|R
