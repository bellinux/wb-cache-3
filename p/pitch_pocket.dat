However, it is now becoming {{a key factor in}} further automation of the forest products industry. As {{a very important part of}} machine vision, developing image segmentation algorithms that can be used for wood products is an ambitious undertaking. The focus of this research was to adapt existing and develop some new segmentation algorithms which could be used to detect defects on veneer surfaces. Nine algorithms covering three segmentation technique categories were explored. Three existing edge detection algorithms were modified for use on veneer images, and four existing thresholding algorithms were adapted in both global and local versions. Two new region extraction algorithms were developed specifically for defect detection on veneer surfaces. The performances of these nine algorithms were tested and compared under the combinations of two camera resolutions (5 -bit and 8 -bit), three color spaces (RGB, Lab, and gray-scale), and seven surface features (clear wood, blue stain, loose knot, <b>pitch</b> <b>pocket,</b> pitch streak, tight knot, and wane). Ten sample images for each of seven surface features on Douglas-fir veneer [Pseudotsuga menziesii] were used. Ten measures were proposed for performance evaluation. A multi-factor factorial ANOVA was used in the performance tests and comparisons. The best combinations of camera resolution and color space for each of the algorithms were determined. The 5 -bit and 8 -bit camera resolutions were not significantly different for the three edge detection and two region extraction algorithms, but the 8 -bit camera resolution was better for all but one of the thresholding algorithms. That exception was the global Otsu thresholding algorithm, for which the 5 -bit camera resolution was better. The RGB color space was the best for all algorithms. Overall, the two region extraction algorithms were the best. Under the best combination of factors, those two algorithms provided the highest defect detection accuracies of 91...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The Pacific Coast {{variety of}} Douglas-fir was investigated. The samples were tested using both forced and free {{vibrations}}. Transverse vibrations were introduced by excitations {{on the side}} of the samples. Forced vibrations were applied from 5000 to 0 hertz by a vibration generator, and free vibrations were initiated by a sharp blow from an impacter. By using forced vibrations the transverse resonant frequencies of the samples were determined. An amplitude ratio was created to compare the sound pole to defective specimens. This ratio is zero or near zero for tests on the sound pole. Poles with brown rot had amplitude ratios which were proportional to the size of the decay pockets. Samples with white rot and <b>pitch</b> <b>pockets</b> had ratios which were consistantly greater than 0. 1. The results of this research, together with the findings of Professor L. C. Jensen, indicate that brown rot, white rot, and <b>pitch</b> <b>pockets</b> can be detected in Douglas-fir poles by measuring the amplitude ratio. Free vibrations were used to determine the velocity of propagation of the transverse wave in the longitudinal and circumferential directions...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Raw {{material}} costs and limited material availability and quality have created significant {{interest in and}} opportunities {{for the application of}} nondestructive evaluation techniques to improve wood processing technologies. The incentives come from the desire to 1) manufacture the highest valued product, 2) conserve the amount of raw material used, 3) use lower priced and often, lower quality raw materials, and 4) meet future demands for wood products in an economy with stark contrasts of a declining wood supply and increasing pressure from environmental concerns. Developing appropriate non-destructive evaluation techniques requires research and development of new concepts and extending the usability of known principles. Dielectrics is one such technique that offers a number of potential applications in areas such as moisture detection, drying and re-drying, grading and sorting, defect detection, curing and gluing of engineered products, repairing and patching of laminated panel products, monitoring of adhesive curing, and manufacturing of aligned fiber products. The objective of this research was to fill the void in knowledge that existed about the dielectric properties of typical features found on Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) wood. Features investigated included clearwood, various sizes of loose and tight knots, knot holes, <b>pitch</b> <b>pockets,</b> <b>pitch</b> streaks, and blue stain. The dielectric constant and loss tangent were analyzed on a global (whole-feature) basis under a range of excitation frequencies and moisture content conditions typically found in wood processing. This research required the development of specialized instrumentation, because measuring the dielectric properties of wood over a broad full range of moisture and excitation frequency conditions is particularly challenging. Results suggested that there are optimal combinations of moisture and excitation frequencies suitable for applications where it is necessary to distinguish between certain wood features. Simple classifications of features measured at such optimal working conditions are presented in addition to global data on the expected dielectric properties of each feature. These results form a fundamental basis for the development of future stand-alone, dielectric-based applications or applications using dielectric-based in conjunction with and other sensing methods...|$|R
40|$|Frequency and Character of Knots in Triangular Profiles of Pine (Pinus silvestris L) and Spruce (Picea abies Karst). by Hans Holmberg Dick Sandberg Abstract This report {{describes}} {{the structure and}} amount of knots in triangular profiles from StarSawing of pine (Pinus silvestris L) and spruce (Picea abies Karst). The yield of blanks is determined mainly with a defined knot structure and the fibre aberration around knots. In addition a minor investigation {{of the amount of}} <b>pitch</b> <b>pockets</b> has been carried out. The specimens comprise of butt logs from three different areas in Sweden. The specimens are taken from normal grown pine, and both normal and fast grown spruce. Large amounts of the knots found in triangular profiles from butt logs are unacceptable for further refinement. Thus, the knots have to be removed. When producing blanks free from knots there is a volume decrease of 8 and 21 percent in average for pine and spruce respectively, referring to the original volume. Further refinement including fibre aberration increases the volume loss by another 5 percent for pine and 6 percent for spruce. The length of the refined blanks varies between 2 and 500 centimetres for pine and between 2 and 400 centimetres for spruce. Measurement results are included in the report for calculating the volume yield of blanks free from knots, with or without fibre aberration. The distributions of lengths of blanks and corresponding volume yields are shown in different graphs...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of an industrial computed tomography scanner for the sawmilling industry {{raises the question of}} how to find a production strategy that uses a computed tomography scanner in the sawmill production line to its full potential. This study was focused on a Scandinavian sawmill processing Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). The potential value increase when allowing an alternative log rotation other than the horns down position was investigated using a log breakdown simulation. The resulting data was analysed with respect to the size of the log rotational step, an introduced rotational error of the sawing machine and different price differences between the quality grades. It was also of interest to define the outer log properties that characterise the logs sawn for the greatest profit return close to the horns down position compared to logs sawn for a greater profit return in a different log rotation. Such characteristics can be used to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in an optimisation and consider instead other parameters, such as positioning and sawing pattern. Other defects such as <b>pitch</b> <b>pockets,</b> splits and rot are also of interest. The results shows that there is a potential value increase when applying the log rotation that maximises the value for each log instead of processing all logs in the horns down position. However, the potential value increase depends on the rotational error of the used sawing machine and the price differences between the quality grades. The log properties that differ between logs sawn for the greatest profit return close to the horns down position compared to a different log rotation are the bow height and the log taper. Unfortunately, predictability of log rotation for greatest profit return based on the outer properties of logs is poor. It is not possible to differentiate logs which would be sawn for the greatest profit return close to the horns down position from those where a different log rotation results in the greatest profit return, based only on their outer properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{forestry-wood chain}} today {{involves}} many actors, and {{the decisions taken}} {{in the process of}} making trees into finished products are so many that the effect of each individual decision is difficult to assess, especially if the natural variation of the input material is considered. This means that a simulation approach to the forestry-wood chain is suitable, since it makes it possible to evaluate the effects of decisions in a short timeframe, while the input material can be kept constant for different production setups. The long term aim is to connect tree and log properties to the quality of a final product through simulation, depending on the various operations involved in making the product. A part of this is realized through this thesis. It is shown that a simulation model of a cross-cutting and finger-jointing process is representative of a real process. The model is used to evaluate an adaptive strategy for setting the safety zone size between finger-joints and sound knots, a strategy which improves recovery in a finger-jointing operation by 3 %. Another issue addressed in this thesis is that of simulation input data. The sawing simulation tool used to a large extent in research today, Saw 2003, usesthe Swedish Pine Stem Bank as input data. This is a very well-documented datasource, and computed tomography (CT) scanning of the stem bank logs allows wood features such as knots to be represented in a realistic way in Saw 2003. There are limitations to the stem bank, however, mostly {{due to the fact that}} CT scanning is a time consuming process, which means that the amount of scanned logs is relatively small. In this thesis, it is shown that it is possible to use a small amount of log features for determining the knot structure in a log, which opens up possibilities for using industrial data from two-directional X-ray scanners. This would increase the amount of logs to be used as simulation input data. A second set of data used for simulation was also collected in a study of a production process, where the wood raw material was followed from the logyard through all production operations of making finger-jointed furniture components. Each individual piece of wood was traced through the operations, thus ensuring a link between the properties of logs and those of the finished product. This second data set was collected by grey-scale camera scanning of boards prior to cross-cutting and finger-jointing, and was used in the development of cross-cutting and finger-jointing simulation. It contains information on non-clearwood features of the board surfaces such as knots, cracks, and <b>pitch</b> <b>pockets.</b> It can be concluded from this thesis that it is possible to increase bothfunctionality and the amount of input data in the simulation of the forestry-wood chain, and by doing so production strategies and decisions can be evaluated. Wood quality discussions may be simplified by being able to assess the effects on the production process of decisions being made. Future work involves adding more functionality to the simulation environment as well as evaluating the methods proposed in this thesis industrially. The long term vision is to be able to integrate the forestry-wood chain from log to finished product in one simulation model.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 In recent years, {{the forest}} {{products}} {{industry has been}} forced to cope with a supply of raw material that is declining in both quality and quantity. In addition, log prices are escalating rapidly. Because log costs may represent as much as 90 percent of the overall production costs of lumber (Williston, 1985), it is crucial that a mill make every attempt to maximize grade and recovery. Quality control (QC) is a broad term used loosely to indicate producing a product to meet the customer's Specifications. In lumber production, quality control is heavily influenced by meeting lumber grade requirements while minimizing fiber use. One component of these grade requirements is conformance to size standards. Size control is one of the functions of a mill's QC department. Size control for lumber manufacturing involves minimizing the variations in the dimensions of lumber that are introduced by the sawing process. An adequate size control program enables a sawmill to maximize both grade and recovery. Grade may be maximized by reducing the amount of boards downgraded due to either excess wane or from planer skip that can result from excessive sawing variation. Minimization of sawing variation can also lead to maximizing recovery. It should be made clear that the reduction in target size that can result from minimizing sawing variation will most often result in a slightly longer or wider board from any one log rather than obtaining additional boards (Darwin, 1989). There are however certain limited log diameter breakpoints at which additional boards may be obtained due to decreased sawing variation. What is proposed in this project is an automated system to collect and analyze board measurement information using optical scanning techniques. The system is intended to provide feedback to mill quality control personnel. This thesis has built upon the image processing and quality control system developed by Aslam (1990) at the Department of Forest Products at Oregon State University. The system is discussed in Aslam's M. S. thesis {{as well as in the}} article by Funck et al. (1992). The image processing system scans the edges of boards while still held in cant form after leaving a gang edger. The system can provide lumber thickness as well as kerf width data. A size control program is included to analyze measurement data and provide information regarding sawing variation. A far more detailed representation of sawing variation can be obtained using this system than is possible with standard size control practices providing measurement accuracy is sufficient. For instance, at gang edgers immediate feedback regarding sawing variation for both boards and kerf is provided. Sawing variation information is of sufficient detail for diagnosing which machine center, and more specifically, which pocket of saws is causing sawing problems. This thesis continued the previous work by quantifying measurement accuracy using various hardware and software configurations, and by developing the software necessary to analyze and then display the data in the most meaningful form. Software techniques were created to avoid measurement errors. The first step in the project was a pilot study conducted using several different imaging configurations, noise filtering techniques, and edge-detection algorithms to quantify the system's precision in measuring static objects. The second step was to develop display software to convey the detailed information this system can provide. The development of measurement error trapping mechanisms was the third step. Measurement errors may occur through incorrectly locating the edges of boards due to the presence of wane, bark, <b>pitch</b> or bark <b>pockets,</b> or knots. Measurement errors may also occur when physically blocked saw kerfs cause a failure to detect a board edge. Lastly, the system was tested on images representing a range of measurement difficulty. This test was performed to determine the measurement accuracy of the system when using combinations of three different edge-detection algorithms and three different noise filtering techniques. This type of automated measurement collection, data analysis and display system will have a financial benefit to a mill by enabling the mill to quickly identify and correct situations leading to sub-optimal lumber or grade recovery...|$|R
