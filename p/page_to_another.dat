5|$|To {{convert the}} {{backlink}} data gathered by BackRub's web crawler into {{a measure of}} importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized {{that it could be}} used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones. The new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one Web <b>page</b> <b>to</b> <b>another,</b> and allowed the number of links and their rank, to determine the rank of the page. Combining their ideas, the pair began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with Stanford's broadband campus network. After filling Page's room with equipment, they then converted Brin's dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the Web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.|$|E

40|$|The World Wide Web (WWW) is a {{hypertext}} based, distributed {{information system}} that provides access to {{a vast amount of}} information on the internet. One difficulty with the Web is browsing specific information of interest to the user from a large number of resources that are available. For most content browsers, to browse a large amount of data, the user needs to click the hyperlinks which contain HTML-coded references pointing <b>to</b> other Web <b>pages</b> <b>to</b> jump <b>to</b> <b>another</b> screen or <b>page.</b> After finishing reading one page, the user has to return to the original document <b>to</b> select for <b>another</b> one. This is a tedious and time consuming process. Therefore, it is necessary to automate the browsing of the World Wide Web to make the task more user friendly. We have developed a Python-based system which provides users a user-friendly scripting environment that helps users to retrieve and browse the Web automatically. Our system is built on top of Python. A number of primitive and high level functions are defined to permit users to write their scripts for browsing on tIhe Web. By calling the functions, the user can easily retrieve Web pages, tranverse a number of links with or without constraint, collect distributed information, and maintain the Web status etc. In this thesis, we first describe the system architecture of Auto-Browser and its features.

If a user clicks on a link {{in a web}} page, and the first glance or two does not suggest the correct category, she may quickly leave the <b>page</b> <b>to</b> find <b>another</b> one. For a well-designed page, viewing the URL {{at the top of}} the page would be far less efficient for classifying the page than getting the gist at a glance. Designers could improve existing applications by, for example, displaying text to be easily readable at a glance and suggestive of the web page’s category, or by including an easily comprehensible image that better cues the category. In working to improve their design, they could also use our technique of rapid presentation coupled with an objective categorization task to test the placement of their menus, ads, and graphical elements. While we do not test usability directly, we argue that having a quickly comprehendible web page would promote overall ease of use. This logic potentially extends to mobile devices: one can consider the first viewport of a mobile <b>page</b> (before scrolling) <b>to</b> be analogous to the first glance of a web page.|$|R
