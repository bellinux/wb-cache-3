5|$|For Washington is a 1911 American silent short {{historical}} fiction drama film {{produced by the}} Thanhouser Company. The film is a fictional account of how a patriotic maid's home is taken over by Hessian officers in the American Revolutionary War. She hides her hatred of them and <b>plies</b> them with drink before delivering a message to George Washington. She leads them in crossing of the Delaware River and the historic capture. The film's crossing scene was inspired by Emmanuel Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware.

His grandfather, Da Lakehal Benzema, lived in the village of Tigzirt, located in the northern town of Beni Djellil in Algeria before migrating to Lyon, where he eventually settled in the 1950s. Benzema's father, Hafid, {{was born in}} Tigzirt, while his mother, Wahida Djebbara, {{was born and raised in}} Lyon; her family originated from Oran. Benzema is the third youngest in the family and grew up with eight other siblings in Bron, an eastern suburb of Lyon. His younger brothers Gressy and Sabri are also footballers. The former currently <b>plies</b> his trade at the amateur level with Vaulx-le-Velin in the Division d'Honneur, the sixth division of French football, while the latter plays in the youth academy of a club in the family's hometown of Bron. Since establishing himself as an international footballer, Benzema has been involved in numerous promotional campaigns. Since 2008, he has regularly appeared on the cover of the French version of the annual FIFA video game. Benzema is sponsored by German sportswear company Adidas and has, subsequently, appeared in several television advertisements for the brand.|$|E

Believed dead, Vincent reveals himself, his gender identity and his pregnancy to Eve after seducing Julian (his father) and threatens {{to kill her}} if she tells anyone. In late 2007, he begins tormenting Eve out of revenge for her failure to prevent his abduction when he was born. Julian checks Eve into rehab after she relapses, abusing drugs and alcohol to cope with Vincent's frequent appearances. Vincent arranges for Eve's release from rehab to help him prepare for the impending birth. Vincent's psychopathic accomplice, Viki Chatsworth, later repeatedly stabs Julian in the groin and severs his penis. Vincent <b>plies</b> Eve with drugs and alcohol so she botches her attempt to surgically reattach Julian's penis; she reattaches it upside-down, and an erection might kill him. In May 2008, Eve and Julian assist Vincent {{with the birth of}} his son on the Russells' kitchen table, when Eve explains everything about Vincent and Valerie to Julian. Eve plans to form a relationship again with Vincent (believing that motherhood has mellowed him), and convinces Julian not to turn him in to the police. During the rehearsal for the joint weddings of Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald and Fancy Crane, Noah Bennett and Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald, Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald and Kay Bennett, and Edna Wallace and Norma Bates, Eve assures Julian that they love each other emotionally and intellectually; Julian vows that the Crane family will take more responsibility for their actions now that Alistair is dead. At the rehearsal dinner, Eve and the other dinner guests eat Vincent and Viki's poisoned mushroom sauce. She dies, but is resurrected when witch Tabitha Lenox renounces magic and becomes a born-again Christian. In the series finale, Kay uses her magic to heal Julian's penis. Since T.

40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae is {{a leading}} cause of human {{diseases}} such as pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, and otitis media. Pneumolysin (<b>Ply)</b> is an important virulence factor of S. pneumoniae and a promising future vaccine target. However, the expansion of clones carrying <b>ply</b> alleles with reduced hemolytic activity has been observed in serotypes associated with outbreaks of invasive disease and includes an allele identified in a highly virulent serotype 1 isolate (<b>ply</b> 4496). The virulence of Ply-deficient and <b>ply</b> allelic-replacement derivatives of S. pneumoniae D 39 was compared with that of wild-type D 39. In addition, the protective immunogenicity of <b>Ply</b> against pneumococci with low versus high hemolytic activity was also investigated. Replacement of D 39 <b>ply</b> with <b>ply</b> 4496 resulted in a small but statistically significant reduction of virulence. However, both native Ply- and <b>Ply</b> 4496 -expressing strains were significantly more virulent than a Ply-deficient mutant. While the numbers of both Ply- and <b>Ply</b> 4496 -expressing isolate cells were higher in the blood than the numbers of Ply-deficient mutant cells, the growth of the <b>Ply</b> 4496 -expressing strain was superior to that of the wild type in the first 15 h postchallenge. <b>Ply</b> immunization provided protection regardless of the hemolytic activity of the challenge strain.

40|$|Pneumolysin (<b>Ply)</b> {{is a key}} {{virulence}} {{factor of}} the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcus). Major functions include forming pores in mammalian cell membranes and activating the complement cascade to divert the host’s immune system. The aim of this thesis was to investigate these processes {{at the molecular level}} to understand how <b>Ply</b> facilitates disease by the pneumococcus. Previous studies have suggested that <b>Ply</b> interacts with various soluble molecules of the immune system, including L-ficolin and IgG. These interactions activate complement via the lectin and classical pathways, respectively. In this thesis I have demonstrated that <b>Ply</b> does not interact with either native serum L-ficolin or recombinant human L-ficolin produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The previous erroneous report probably arose as a result of contamination of <b>Ply</b> preparations with L-ficolin ligands. Investigation of binding between <b>Ply</b> and IgG showed that <b>Ply</b> binds to IgG 2, IgG 3 and IgG 4 but not to IgG 1. Binding is mediated through interactions between domains 1 - 3 of <b>Ply</b> and the Fab region of the IgGs. An additional aim of this thesis was to investigate pore formation by <b>Ply.</b> The crystal structure of <b>Ply,</b> determined in our group, showed that <b>Ply</b> monomers in the crystal pack together similar {{to the way in which}} they are likely to assemble on the cell surface prior to pore formation. Based on the structure, a series of mutations were created to disrupt packing between <b>Ply</b> monomers during pre-pore and pore formation. The activities of two of the mutants, Asp 205 Arg and Asn 339 Arg were completely abolished and most of the mutants had greatly reduced activities compared to wild-type <b>Ply</b> indicating that these residues play important roles during pore formation. Interestingly, electron microscopy showed that <b>Ply</b> Asp 205 Arg forms chain like structures on membranes but cannot form circular pores or arcs. Thus although monomers still self-associated they could not kill cells. By contrast, <b>Ply</b> Asn 339 Arg, binds to the membrane but does not oligomerize. In further work, crystal structures of the membrane-binding domain of <b>Ply</b> revealed conformational changes in a Trp rich-loop at the base of the toxin involved in membrane binding. These changes promote new packing interactions between <b>Ply</b> monomer thereby promoting oligomerization on the membrane. Finally, I investigated the structural changes of the membrane by spectroscopic monitoring of optically trapped vesicles. The inelastic back-scattered light was monitored from a single liposome, held by optical tweezers and exposed to <b>Ply.</b> <b>Ply</b> binding increased the membrane fluidity due to a decrease in the short-range order of the lipid molecules in the bilayer. Analysis of a series of point mutants suggests that these changes are caused by association of <b>Ply</b> monomers during formation of the pre-pore, prior to insertion across the membrane...|$|R

40|$|The Gram-positive {{bacterium}} Streptococcus pneumoniae(pneumococcus) {{is a major}} human pathogen, causing Otitis media, pneumonia, bacteraemia and meningitis worldwide. There {{are over}} 90 different serotypes of pneumococcus and current pneumococcal vaccines are somewhat limited in their protection against pneumococcal diseases. Currently available vaccines {{are based on the}} capsular polysaccharide. The 23 -valent polysaccharide (PSP) vaccine can protect most of adults and children older than five, but it cannot protect children under age 2, immunodeficiency patients and cannot protect the elderly very well. The polysaccharide/ protein conjugated vaccines which are complementary to the 23 -valent PS vaccine have been introduced. The PSP conjugate vaccine is highly immunogenic and protects {{children under the age of}} 2 and immunodeficiency patients against invasive pneumococcal diseases, but its efficacy is threatened by strain replacement and serotype switching since it only protects against the limited number of serotypes contained within the vaccine. There is therefore a need to develop improved vaccines against pneumococcal diseases. Pneumolysin (<b>PLY),</b> a cholesterol dependent cytolysin and an important virulence factor of pneumococcus, can act as a powerful mucosal adjuvant to induce both systemic and mucosal immunity to proteins genetically fused to <b>PLY.</b> Which regions of <b>PLY</b> are required for the novel adjuvant activity is not currently known. The model antigen eGFP was fused to domain 1 - 3 of <b>PLY</b> (D 123 <b>PLY)</b> and domain 4 of <b>PLY</b> (D 4 <b>PLY)</b> by ligation-dependent DNA recombinant technology during my master project. Balb/c mice were intranasally immunised with purified eGFPD 4 <b>PLY</b> or eGFPD 123 <b>PLY</b> fusion protein and immune response were then monitored by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA data shows truncated <b>PLY</b> lost the adjuvant property and this adjuvant property was restored in the presence of free <b>PLY</b> or A 6 <b>PLY</b> when antigen was fused with truncated <b>PLY.</b> The aim of the current work is to determine whether a fusion protein based pneumococcal vaccine can be developed to provide protection against three pneumococcal strains in animal models of colonisation and invasive diseases. For this purpose, pneumococcal virulence factors, PsaA, PspA, PspC and PhtD were genetically fused to <b>PLY</b> or Δ 6 <b>PLY</b> separately by In-fusion cloning technology. Δ 6 <b>PLY</b> is a toxoid that lacks haemolytic activity but retains the immunogenic and adjuvant activity of <b>PLY.</b> MF 1 mice were then vaccinated either intranasally or subcutanously by purified fusion protein antigens and immune responses were also monitored by ELISA; vaccinated mice were finally challenged intranasally by three strains of pneumococcus and monitored for colonisation.
