2500|$|An adaptor (in {{the context}} of plugs and sockets) is defined in IEC 60050 as a {{portable}} accessory constructed as an integral unit incorporating both a <b>plug</b> <b>portion</b> and one or more socket-outlet portions. [...] (There is an alternative spelling, adapter, but adaptor is the form usually used in standards and official documents.) ...|$|E
50|$|It {{consists}} of a hole, usually round or oval, and a tapered plug, usually a disk shape {{on the end of}} a shaft also called a valve stem. The portion of the hole where the plug meets with it is referred to as the 'seat' or 'valve seat'. The shaft guides the <b>plug</b> <b>portion</b> by sliding through a valve guide. In exhaust applications a pressure differential helps to seal the valve and in intake valves a pressure differential helps open it. Poppet valves date from at least the 1770s, when James Watt used them on his steam engines.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the design and {{performance}} of the electromagnetic calorimeter timing readout system (EMTiming) for the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF). The system {{will be used in}} searches for rare events with high energy photons to verify that the photon is in time with the event collision, to reject cosmic ray and beam halo backgrounds, and to allow direct searches for new heavy long-lived particles that decay to photons. The installation and commissioning of all 862 channels was completed in Fall 2004 as part of an upgrade to the Run II version of the detector. Using in-situ data, including electrons from W → eν and Z → ee decays, we measure the energy threshold for a time to be recorded to be 3. 8 ± 0. 3 GeV in the central portion of the detector and 1. 9 ± 0. 1 GeV in the <b>plug</b> <b>portion.</b> Similarly, we measure a timing resolution of 600 ± 10 ps and 610 ± 10 ps for electrons above 10 GeV and 6 GeV respectively. There are very few system pathologies such as recording a time when no energy is deposited, or recording a second, fake time for a single energy deposit. Key words: electromagnetic calorimeter, timing, CD...|$|E
40|$|A {{fluid mixer}} plug has holes formed {{therethrough}} such that a remaining portion is closed to fluid flow. The plug's inlet face defines a central circuit region and a ring-shaped region with the ring-shaped region {{including at least}} some of the <b>plug's</b> remaining <b>portion</b> so-closed to fluid flow. This remaining portion or closed region at each radius R of the ring shaped region satisfies a radius independent, flow-based relationship. Entry openings are defined in the plug's inlet face in correspondence with the holes. The entry openings define an open flow area at each radius of the ring-shaped region. The open flow area at each such radius satisfies the inverse of the flow-based relationship defining the closed regions of the plug...|$|R
2500|$|BS 8546 {{applies to}} travel {{adaptors}} having {{at least one}} <b>plug</b> or socket-outlet <b>portion</b> compatible with BS 1363 plugs and socket-outlets. It {{was first published in}} April 2016 to provide a standard for travel adaptors suitable for the connection of a non-BS 1363 plug, or to a non-BS 1363 socket-outlet. [...] It provides for an overall rating of 250V ac, minimum current rating of 5A, and a maximum of 13A. Adaptors with BS 1363 plug pins must incorporate a BS 1362 fuse. [...] BS 8546 travel adaptors may also include USB charging ports.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to develop and evaluate a pulsatile system of theophylline based on chronopharmaceutical considerations. The basic design consists of an impermeable capsule body, which contains the drug and is closed by an erodible tablet <b>plug.</b> The body <b>portion</b> of the hard gelatin capsules was cross-linked by the combined effect of formaldehyde and heat treatment. The formulation variables such as type of plug material, capsule content, different plug composition, plug weight and plug hardness was investigated to characterize the lag time (t 10). The results indicated that drug release from the pulsatile capsule exhibited an initial lag period, followed by a stage of rapid drug release. For the complete and rapid drug release from the capsule body, 15 % of effervescent agent had to be included in the capsule content. The lag time criterion of 5 hrs was satisfied by the tablet plug containing 16 %HPMC K 100 LV. A good correlation was observed between erodible tablet weight and lag time...|$|R
