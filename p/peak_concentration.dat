25|$|Dexlansoprazole is an (R)-(+)-enantiomer of lansoprazole, {{marketed as}} Dexilant. After oral {{appliance}} of the racemic lansoprazole, the circulating drug is 80% dexlansoprazole.

The advantage is the pharmaceutical formulation of the drug, which is based on a dual release technology, with the first quick release producing a blood plasma <b>peak</b> <b>concentration</b> about one hour after application, and the second retarded release producing another peak about four hours later.|$|E

40|$|A {{novel and}} {{accurate}} method for predicting gentamicin <b>peak</b> serum <b>concentration</b> is described. The method considers body weight and renal function {{as determined by}} the concentration of beta 2 microglobulin in plasma. In 32 subjects whose renal function ranged from normal to severely impaired, the <b>peak</b> serum <b>concentration</b> of gentamicin was more closely correlated with beta 2 microglobulin (r = 0. 69) and with creatinine clearance (r = 0. 69) than with serum creatinine (r = 0. 53). A nomogram was constructed which related plasma beta 2 microglobulin concentrations and body weight to predicted gentamicin <b>peak</b> serum <b>concentrations.</b> When the nomogram was clinically applied, the predicted <b>peak</b> gentamicin <b>concentrations</b> corresponded closely to the actual measurements obtained (t = 0. 64; P is not significant).

25|$|The {{half-life}} of {{this drug}} is about 11.5 hours, and the {{concentration in the}} brain remains at around 5–10% of the total dose during that time. When a 'mega-dose' is administered, as in state-sanctioned lethal injection, the concentration in the brain during the tail phase of the distribution remains higher than the <b>peak</b> <b>concentration</b> found in the induction dose for anesthesia, because repeated doses—or a single very high dose as in lethal injection—accumulate in high concentrations in body fat, from which the thiopental is gradually released. This {{is the reason why}} an ultra-short acting barbiturate, such as thiopental, can be used for long-term induction of medical coma.|$|E
25|$|Azithromycin is an acid-stable antibiotic, {{so it can}} {{be taken}} orally with no need of {{protection}} from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed, but absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to <b>peak</b> <b>concentration</b> (Tmax) in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to its high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma due to ion trapping and its high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days.|$|E
25|$|In {{a natural}} setting, the {{respiratory}} infection of Sendai virus in mice is acute. From the extrapolation of the infection of laboratory mice, {{the presence of}} the virus may first be detected in the lungs 48 to 72 hours following exposure. As the virus replicates in the respiratory tract of an infected mouse, the concentration of the virus grows most quickly during the third day of infection. After that, the growth of the virus is slower but consistent. Typically, the <b>peak</b> <b>concentration</b> of the virus is on the sixth or seventh day, and rapid decline follows that by the ninth day. A fairly vigorous immune response mounted against the virus is the cause of this decline. The longest period of detected presence of the virus in a mouse lung is fourteen days after infection.|$|E

40|$|During the 2010 {{eruption}} of Eyjafjallajökull, improvements {{were made to}} the modeling procedure at the Met Office, UK, enabling <b>peak</b> ash <b>concentrations</b> within the volcanic cloud to be estimated. In this paper we describe the ash concentration forecasting method, its rationale and how it evolved over time in response to new information and user requirements. The change from solely forecasting regions of ash to also estimating <b>peak</b> ash <b>concentrations</b> required consideration of volcanic ash emission rates, the fraction of ash surviving near-source fall-out, and the relationship between predicted mean and local <b>peak</b> ash <b>concentrations</b> unresolved by the model. To validate the modeling procedure, predicted <b>peak</b> ash <b>concentrations</b> are compared against observations obtained by ground-based and research aircraft instrumentation. This comparison between modeled and observed <b>peak</b> <b>concentrations</b> highlights the many sources of error and the uncertainties involved. Despite the challenges of predicting ash concentrations, the ash forecasting method employed here is found to give useful guidance on likely ash <b>concentrations.</b> Predicted <b>peak</b> ash <b>concentrations</b> lie within about one and a half orders of magnitude of the observed <b>peak</b> <b>concentrations.</b> A significant improvement in the agreement between modeled and observed values is seen if a buffer zone, accounting for positional errors in the predicted ash cloud, is used. Sensitivity of the predicted ash concentrations to the source properties (e. g., the plume height and the vertical distribution of ash at the source) is assessed and in some cases, seemingly minor uncertainties in the source specification have a large effect on predicted ash concentrations. ...|$|R

25|$|Etoricoxib, that is {{used for}} {{patients}} with chronic arthropathies and musculoskeletal and dental pain, is absorbed moderately when given orally. A study on its pharmacokinetics showed that the plasma <b>peak</b> <b>concentration</b> of etoricoxib occurs after approximately 1 hour. It has shown to be extensively bound to plasma albumin (about 90%), and has an apparent volume of distribution (VD) of 120 L in humans. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increases in proportion to increased dosage (5–120mg). The elimination half-life is about 20 hours in healthy individuals, and such long half-life enables the choice to have once-daily dosage. Etoricoxib, like the other coxibs, is excreted in urine and feces and also metabolized in likewise manner. CYP3A4 is mostly responsible for biotransformation of etoricoxib to carboxylic acid metabolite, but a non CYP450 metabolism pathway to glucuronide metabolite is also at hand. A very small portion of etoricoxib (<1%) is eliminated unchanged in the urine. Patients with chronic renal insufficiency {{do not appear to}} have different plasma concentration curve (AUC) compared to healthy individuals. It has though been reported that patients with moderate hepatic impairment have increased plasma concentration curve (AUC) by approximately 40%. It has been stated that further study is necessary to describe precisely the relevance of pharmacokinetic properties in terms of the clinical benefits and risks of etoricoxib compared to other clinical options.|$|E

40|$|Many {{in vitro}} {{investigations}} with anticancer agents are performed at concentrations {{equal to the}} <b>peak</b> <b>concentrations</b> or fractions of the <b>peak</b> <b>concentrations</b> achieved in human plasma after administration of these agents. In an effort to develop an in vitro test capable of predicting these <b>peak</b> plasma <b>concentrations</b> prior to the completion of pharmacokinetic studies, the effect of several classes of anticancer agents against normal human bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells (CFU-GM) was studied. The investigated agents included anthracycline antibiotics, cisplatin and its analogs, anthracene derivatives and two flavone acetic acid derivatives. The CFU-GM were exposed to these agents for 30 - 60 min. An exponential relationship between drug concentration and CFU-GM growth was observed for all compounds {{with the exception of}} the flavone acetic acid derivatives which were inactive. For the latter two compounds, an inhibition of CFU-GM growth was observed after continuous exposure. When compared to the plasma concentrations after parenteral administration of these agents, there was a very good agreement between 1 / 10 of the <b>peak</b> plasma <b>concentration</b> and the concentration inducing a 90 % inhibition of the CFU-GM growth for the anthracycline antibiotics and anthracene derivatives.

The combination of concentrations inducing inhibitions of 10 and 90 % of the CFU-GM growth provides a range of concentrations that predict reasonably well the <b>peak</b> plasma <b>concentrations</b> of several anticancer agents and that could be used as guides for other in vitro investigations.
