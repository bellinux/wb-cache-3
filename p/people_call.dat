5|$|The Przewalski's horse (Equus ferus przewalskii), {{named after}} the Russian {{explorer}} Nikolai Przhevalsky, is a rare Asian animal. It {{is also known as}} the Mongolian wild horse; Mongolian people know it as the taki, and the Kyrgyz <b>people</b> <b>call</b> it a kirtag. The subspecies was presumed extinct in the wild between 1969 and 1992, while a small breeding population survived in zoos around the world. In 1992, it was reestablished in the wild due to the conservation efforts of numerous zoos. Today, a small wild breeding population exists in Mongolia. There are additional animals still maintained at zoos throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|The red panda's local names {{differ from}} place to place. The Lepcha <b>people</b> <b>call</b> it sak nam. In Nepal, the species is called bhalu biralo (bear-cat) and habre.

In the Kanchenjunga region of eastern Nepal, the Limbus know red pandas as kaala, which {{literally}} means dark because of their underside pelage; villagers of Tibetan origin call them hoptongar.|$|E

25|$|As this prudent economy, {{which some}} <b>people</b> <b>call</b> Saving, is in private {{families}} the most certain method to increase an estate, so some imagine that, whether a country be barren or fruitful, the same method if generally pursued (which they think practicable) {{will have the}} same effect upon a whole nation, and that, for example, the English might be much richer than they are, if they would be as frugal as some of their neighbours. This, I think, is an error.|$|E
25|$|String bands provide {{elaborate}} performances. Limited to unamplified strings, reeds, and percussion, string bands feature banjos, saxophones (alto, tenor, baritone and bass), accordions, double basses, drums, glockenspiels and violins {{in musical}} arrangements {{tied to a}} theme presented by the captain, beautiful costumes and props (some <b>people</b> <b>call</b> them floats). Historically, string bands performed mostly in military-drill formations. Harrowgate (now Uptown) String Band's first-prize-winning railroad tunes with Broadway-style dance in 1976 changed that. String-band performances are now the most elaborate of the parade, outdone only by the fancy brigades indoor performance.|$|E

25|$|The {{official}} school mascot is the mustang. Students at UC Davis {{are referred}} to as Aggies in honor of the school's origins in agricultural studies. Unlike most colleges, there is a distinction between the name for students and the mascot. Some students supported changing the school mascot from the mustang to a cow, but alumni opposed this action. Many <b>people</b> <b>call</b> the mustang mascot of UC Davis an Aggie, but it is named Gunrock. The name dates to 1921 when the US Army brought a thoroughbred horse named Gunrock to UC Davis to supply high-quality breeding stock for the US Cavalry remount program. The mustang mascot was selected to honor that cavalry horse.|$|E
25|$|I don't {{know why}} <b>people</b> <b>call</b> me a jazz singer, though I guess people {{associate}} me with jazz because I {{was raised in}} it, from way back.

I can't sing a blues – just a right-out blues – but I can put the blues in whatever I sing. I might sing 'Send In the Clowns' and I might stick a little bluesy part in it, or any song. What I want to do, music-wise, is all kinds of music that I like, and I like all kinds of music.|$|E
25|$|William Ruddiman has {{proposed}} the early anthropocene hypothesis, {{according to which}} the anthropocene era, as some <b>people</b> <b>call</b> the most recent period in the earth's history when {{the activities of the}} human species first began to have a significant global impact on the earth's climate and ecosystems, did not begin in the 18th century {{with the advent of the}} Industrial Era, but dates back to 8,000 years ago, due to intense farming activities of our early agrarian ancestors. It was at that time that atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations stopped following the periodic pattern of the Milankovitch cycles. In his overdue-glaciation hypothesis Ruddiman states that an incipient glacial would probably have begun several thousand years ago, but the arrival of that scheduled glacial was forestalled by the activities of early farmers.|$|E

25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume I took some Beatles and, you know, threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction. It's not an easy thing to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if I could do this. Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music.

25|$|In {{the early}} days, the {{inhabitants}} {{on the island}} were mostly farmers and fishermen. The major population concentrated in the northeast portion of the island. Farmers grew rice, vegetables and pineapples, while fishermen lived in huts connected by plank walkways in the small harbour of Tsing Yi Tong which stretched far back into the island. Many fishermen also lived on their junks and boats all the time, fishing in the nearby waters. Even {{as late as the}} 1970s, Tsing Yi Tong resembled Tai O with its characteristic stilt houses and water vehicles. Like many other fishing villages in Hong Kong, the Tsing Yi dwellers worshipped Tin Hau, the goddess of mercy and the sea. A Tin Hau Temple was built on the shore of Tsing Yi Tong. At the birthday of Tin Hau, fishermen of all nearby waters would come to the Temple for celebrations. The temple was white in color and thus <b>people</b> <b>call</b> it Pak Miu (白廟, lit. White Temple).|$|E

Harrison's setting won the first prize at the Norwich Musical Festival, adjudicated by Frederick Delius, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and Ernest Walker.

[...] The reviewer in The Manchester Guardian was more complimentary; though he commented on the obvious influence of Bantock, and over-elaborate orchestration, he wrote that Harrison had undoubted talent.|$|E
