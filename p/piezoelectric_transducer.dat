5|$|One type of <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>{{transducer}}</b> is the Langevin type, {{named after}} a transducer used by Paul Langevin in early sonar research.

5|$|Phase {{shifting}} interferometry overcomes {{these limitations}} by not relying on finding fringe centers, {{but rather by}} collecting intensity data from every point of the CCD image sensor. As seen in Fig.17, multiple interferograms (at least three) are analyzed with the reference optical surface shifted by a precise fraction of a wavelength between each exposure using a <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>transducer</b> (PZT). Alternatively, precise phase shifts can be introduced by modulating the laser frequency. The captured images are processed by a computer to calculate the optical wavefront errors. The precision and reproducibility of PSI is far greater than possible in static interferogram analysis, with measurement repeatabilities of a hundredth of a wavelength being routine. Phase shifting technology has been adapted {{to a variety of}} interferometer types such as Twyman-Green, Mach–Zehnder, laser Fizeau, and even common path configurations such as point diffraction and lateral shearing interferometers. More generally, phase shifting techniques can be adapted to almost any system that uses fringes for measurement, such as holographic and speckle interferometry.|$|E

In our system, <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>transducers</b> are connected to an electric circuit composed of the diodes, an inductance, and a selective switch. Our method (SSDI) makes better use of counterelectromotive force to suppress the vibration, instead of simple dissipation of vibration energy. We use an actual artificial satellite to verify their high performance compared to conventional semi-active methods. As a consequence, we demonstrate that our semi-active switching method can suppress the vibration of the real artificial satellite {{to as much as}} 50 % amplitude reduction. In our experiment, we reveal that the suppression performance depends on how multiple <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>transducers</b> are connected, namely, their series or parallel connection. We draw two major conclusions from theoretical analysis and experiment, for constructing effective semi-active controller using <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>transducers.</b> This paper clearly proves that the performance of the method is the connection (series or parallel) of multiple <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>transducers</b> and the their resistances dependent on frequency...|$|R

500|$|Both {{magnetostrictive}} and <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>transducers</b> {{are used}} in mechanical filters. <b>Piezoelectric</b> <b>transducers</b> are favoured in recent designs since the piezoelectric material {{can also be used}} as one of the resonators of the filter, thus reducing the number of components and thereby saving space.

500|$|A {{piezoelectric}} {{material is}} one which changes shape when an electric field is applied. In reverse, it produces an electric field {{when it is}} distorted. A <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>transducer,</b> in essence, is made simply by plating electrodes on to the piezoelectric material. Early piezoelectric materials used in transducers such as barium titanate had poor temperature stability. [...] This precluded the transducer from functioning {{as one of the}} resonators; {{it had to be a}} separate component. [...] This problem was solved with the introduction of lead zirconate titanate (abbreviated PZT) which is stable enough to be used as a resonator. Another common piezoelectric material is quartz, which has also been used in mechanical filters. [...] However, ceramic materials such as PZT are preferred for their greater electromechanical coupling coefficient.|$|E
500|$|There are a {{great many}} {{combinations}} of resonators and transducers {{that can be used}} to construct a mechanical filter. A selection of some of these is shown in the diagrams. Figure 6 shows a filter using disc flexural resonators and magnetostrictive transducers. The transducer drives the centre of the first resonator, causing it to vibrate. The edges of the disc move in antiphase to the centre when the driving signal is at, or close to, resonance, and the signal is transmitted through the connecting rods to the next resonator. [...] When the driving signal is not close to resonance, there is little movement at the edges, and the filter rejects (does not pass) the signal. Figure 7 shows a similar idea involving longitudinal resonators connected together in a chain by connecting rods. In this diagram, the filter is driven by piezoelectric transducers. It could equally well have used magnetostrictive transducers. Figure 8 shows a filter using torsional resonators. In this diagram, the input has a torsional <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>transducer</b> and the output has a magnetostrictive transducer. This would be quite unusual in a real design, as both input and output usually have the same type of transducer. The magnetostrictive transducer is only shown here to demonstrate how longitudinal vibrations may be converted to torsional vibrations and vice versa. Figure 9 shows a filter using drumhead mode resonators. The edges of the discs are fixed to the casing of the filter (not shown in the diagram) so the vibration of the disc is in the same modes as the membrane of a drum. Collins calls this type of filter a disc wire filter.|$|E

Researchers at MIT developed the first micro-scale piezoelectric energy harvester using thin film PZT in 2005. Arman Hajati and Sang-Gook Kim invented the Ultra Wide-Bandwidth micro-scale piezoelectric energy harvesting device by exploiting the nonlinear stiffness of a doubly clamped microelectromechanical systems (MEMSs) resonator. The stretching strain in a doubly clamped beam shows a nonlinear stiffness, which provides a passive feedback and results in amplitude-stiffened Duffing mode resonance. [...] Typically, piezoelectric cantilevers are adopted for the above-mentioned energy harvesting system. [...] One drawback is that the piezoelectric cantilever has gradient strain distribution, i.e., the <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>transducer</b> is not fully utilized.
