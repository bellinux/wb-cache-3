40|$|Keywords:low-voltage distribution; system ground; {{protective}} earthing; iterative earth Abstract. Electricity is {{the foundation}} of modern industrial and people’s daily life,as the most basic energy. The higher desire for power supply quality and reliability has been advanced along with the rapid development of national economy. Given the importance of electrical safety in the application of electric energy,it’s necessary to be aware of electricity protective measures,especially the <b>protective</b> <b>earthing</b> ways as the indirect contact protective measures...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Protective</b> <b>earths</b> are now {{run with}} {{lighting}} circuits {{to allow for}} metallic lamp holders to be earthed.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to a SELV circuit, a PELV circuit can have a <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> (ground) connection. A PELV circuit, just as with SELV, requires a design that guarantees a low risk of accidental contact with a higher voltage. For a transformer, this can mean that the primary and secondary windings must be separated by an extra insulation barrier, or by a conductive shield with a <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> connection.|$|R
50|$|In the TN-S system, {{separate}} {{neutral and}} <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> conductors are installed between {{the equipment and}} the source of supply (generator or electric utility transformer). Normal circuit currents flow only in the neutral, and the <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> conductor bonds all equipment cases to earth to intercept any leakage current due to insulation failure. The neutral conductor is connected to earth at the building point of supply, but no common path to ground exists for circuit current and the protective conductor.|$|R
5000|$|... "N" [...] — Earth {{connection}} is {{supplied by the}} electricity supply Network, either as a separate <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> (PE) conductor or combined with the neutral conductor.|$|R
50|$|The {{equipment}} {{shall have}} a measured {{resistance of the}} <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> circuit, or the earthing conductor of an extension cord or appliance cord set, which does not exceed 1Ω.|$|R
5000|$|Each of {{the current}} {{carrying}} conductors in the [...] "core" [...] is insulated by an individual thermoplastic sheath, coloured to indicate {{the purpose of the}} conductor concerned. The <b>Protective</b> <b>Earth</b> conductor may also be covered with Green/Yellow (or Green only) insulation, although, in some countries, this conductor may be left as bare copper. With cables where the current carrying conductors are of a large Cross Sectional Area (CSA) and current carrying capacity, the <b>Protective</b> <b>Earth</b> conductor may be found to be of a smaller CSA, with a lower continuous current carrying capacity. The conductors used may be solid in cross-section or multi-stranded.|$|R
5000|$|TN {{networks}} {{save the}} cost of a low-impedance earth connection at the site of each consumer. Such a connection (a buried metal structure) is required to provide <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> in IT and TT systems.|$|R
50|$|A current, {{equal to}} the rated {{tripping}} current, shall be “suddenly” applied between active and <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> and the operating time measured with maximum trip time 40ms for Type I and 300ms for Type II.|$|R
5000|$|Sockets {{intended}} for use with the American Split Phase distribution system may have two phase contacts and neutral In this case the phase designators X and Y are used. [...] They may also include a <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> contact.|$|R
5000|$|Typically a third conductor, called ground (or [...] "safety ground") (U.S.) or <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> (UK, Europe, IEC), {{is used as}} a {{protection}} against electric shock, and ordinarily only carries significant current when there is a circuit fault. Several different earthing systems are in use.|$|R
50|$|Single phase sockets are {{classified}} as two pole (2P) and provide a single line contact and a neutral contact. In addition, a <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> (Ground in American terminology) contact is usually, but not always, present, {{in which case the}} socket is classified as two pole and earth(2P+E).|$|R
5000|$|Three phase sockets provide three line {{contacts}}, {{they may}} also include either or both of a neutral and <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> contact. The designations of the three contacts may vary. The IEC standards use the Line designations L1, L2 and L3. [...] NEMA standards use the Phase designations X, Y and Z.|$|R
50|$|This is a direct, {{semi-active}} {{connection of}} the EV to the AC mains, either 250 V 1-phase or 400 V 3-phase including earth at a maximum current of 32 A. There is a direct, passive connection from the AC mains to the EV supply equipment (EVSE), {{which must be}} part of, or situated within 0.3 m of, the AC mains plug; from the EVSE to the EV, there is an active connection, {{with the addition of}} the control pilot to the passive components. The EVSE provides <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> presence detection and monitoring; ground fault, over-current, and over-temperature protection; and functional switching, depending on vehicle presence and charging power demand. Some protections must be provided by an SPR-PRCD conforming to IEC 62335 Circuit breakers - Switched <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> portable residual current devices for class I and battery powered vehicle applications.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States National Electrical Code and Canadian Electrical Code {{the feed}} from the {{distribution}} transformer uses a combined neutral and grounding conductor, {{but within the}} structure separate neutral and <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> conductors are used (TN-C-S). The neutral must be connected to earth only {{on the supply side}} of the customer's disconnecting switch.|$|R
25|$|A {{functional}} {{earth connection}} serves more than protecting against electrical shock, {{as such a}} connection may carry current during the normal operation of a device. Such devices include surge suppression, electromagnetic-compatibility filters, some types of antennas, and various measurement instruments. Generally the <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> system is also used as a functional earth, though this requires care.|$|R
50|$|Also {{available}} in smaller conductor sizes are versions containing three current-carrying conductors and a circuit <b>protective</b> (<b>earth)</b> conductor. These configurations {{are commonly used}} for applications such as switched light circuits, battery-backed emergency lighting which requires a switched and unswitched supply, extractor fans with a run-on timer which require a switched and unswitched supply, mains-powered interlinked smoke alarms, and central heating thermostats.|$|R
50|$|The signal {{pins and}} their {{function}} were defined in SAE J1772-2001, which {{was included in}} IEC 61851. All plug types of IEC 62196-2 have the two additional signals: the control pilot (CP; pin 4) and proximity pilot (PP; pin 5) over the normal charging power pins: line (L1; pin 1), line or neutral (N, or L2; pin 2), and <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> (PE; pin 3).|$|R
5000|$|Cables {{are most}} {{commonly}} a single outer sheath containing separately-insulated [...] and neutral wires, and a non-insulated <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> to which sleeving is added when exposed. Standard sizes have a conductor {{cross sectional area}} of 1, 1.5, 2.5, 4, 6 and 10 mm2. Sizes of 1 or 1.5 mm2 are typically used for 6 or 10 ampere lighting circuits and 2.5 mm2 for socket circuits.|$|R
50|$|Because the Neutral (N) wire is fed {{straight}} through the Rectiverter, the mains feed should have an unbroken path from N to <b>Protective</b> <b>Earth</b> (PE), i.e. the N should not be broken in any distribution point from the source to the Rectiverter system. If the feed is broken the N must be bonded to PE in the system with a link of the same rating as the incoming feed.|$|R
50|$|In a TT (Terra-Terra) <b>earthing</b> system, the <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> {{connection}} {{for the consumer}} is provided by a local earth electrode, (sometimes {{referred to as the}} Terra-Firma connection) and there is another independently installed at the generator. There is no 'earth wire' between the two.The fault loop impedance is higher, and unless the electrode impedance is very low indeed, a TT installation should always have an RCD (GFCI) as its first isolator.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis chapter {{provides}} a statistical evaluation of MIMO-PLC channels properties plus the spatial correlation of the MIMO paths. In addition, the moise received in a MIMO PLC systems is analyzed. Information {{on the presence}} of the <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> wire, on measurements methods and on MIMO topologies and corresponding coupling devices are described in detail. New models of the channel transfer function (CTF) and multiple-output noise, based on observed statistics, are also presented...|$|R
30|$|LV {{distribution}} networks {{consist of}} several conductors {{which can be}} simultaneously used to set up multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication links. This strategy is being successfully employed in wireless communications and in indoor BB-PLC [19], where the phase, neutral, and <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> conductors are used for the MIMO. However, there are almost no available works on NB-PLC MIMO, and they are limited to explore indoor NB-PLC channels [20] or to plain tests using existing single phase PRIME devices [21].|$|R
50|$|The {{charging}} station sends a 1 kHz square wave on the contact pilot that is connected {{back to the}} protected earth {{on the side of}} the vehicle by means of a resistor and a diode (voltage range ±12.0±0.4 V). The live wires of public {{charging station}}s are always dead if the CP-PE (<b>protective</b> <b>earth)</b> circuit is open, although the standard allows a charging current as in Mode 1 (maximum 16 A). If the circuit is closed then the charging station can also test the <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> to be functional. The vehicle can request a charging state by setting a resistor; using 2.7 kΩ a Mode 3 compatible vehicle is announced (vehicle detected) which does not require charging. Switching to 880 Ω the vehicle is ready to be charged and switching to 240 Ω the vehicle requests with ventilation charging in which case charging power is only supplied if the area is ventilated (i.e., outdoors). The charging station can use the wave signal to describe the maximum current that is available from the charging station with the help of pulse width modulation: a 16% PWM is a 10 A maximum, a 25% PWM is a 16 A maximum, a 50% PWM is a 32 A maximum and a 90% PWM flags a fast charge option.|$|R
5000|$|In Australia, New Zealand and Israel the TN-C-S {{system is}} in use; however, the wiring rules {{currently}} state that, in addition, each customer must provide a separate connection to earth via both a water pipe bond (if metallic water pipes enter the consumer's premises) and a dedicated earth electrode. In Australia and New Zealand {{this is called the}} Multiple Earthed Neutral Link or MEN Link. This MEN Link is removable for installation testing purposes, but is connected during use by either a locking system (locknuts for instance) or two or more screws. In the MEN system, the integrity of the Neutral is paramount. In Australia, new installations must also bond the foundation concrete re-enforcing under wet areas to the earth conductor (AS3000), typically increasing the size of the earthing, and provides an equipotential plane in areas such as bathrooms. In older installations, {{it is not uncommon to}} find only the water pipe bond, and it is allowed to remain as such, but the additional earth electrode must be installed if any upgrade work is done. The <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> and neutral conductors are combined until the consumer's neutral link (located on the customer's side of the electricity meter's neutral connection) - beyond this point, the <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> and neutral conductors are separate.|$|R
25|$|Some devices {{require a}} {{connection}} to the mass of earth to function correctly, as distinct from any purely protective role. Such a connection is known as a functional earth- for example some long wavelength antenna structures require a functional earth connection, which generally should not be indiscriminately connected to the supply <b>protective</b> <b>earth,</b> as the introduction of transmitted radio frequencies into the electrical distribution network is both illegal and potentially dangerous. Because of this separation, a purely functional ground should not normally be relied upon to perform a protective function.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} neutral and <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> currents in the frequency range 2 through 150 kHz. Both theoretical analysis and measurements will be presented. It is concluded that {{a large part of}} the high frequency distortion in the phase currents closes via the neutral wire and impacts the terminal voltage for equipment in the other phases. The introduction of HF-harmonics is even more detrimental to the intention with three-phase systems to minimize the currents outside the phase conductors.

50|$|In 2006, Suffolk Coastal District Council (SCDC) {{rejected}} a planning application for 120 log cabins {{on a site}} next to Waldringfield Road. The rejection was {{on the grounds that}} it was too near the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty amongst other reasons, and would result in an unacceptable increase in visitor numbers to a sensitive areas. BT initially objected {{on the grounds that it}} would interfere with their radio test area, although BT subsequently withdrew their objection provided the developer created a <b>protective</b> <b>earth</b> bund, rejected by SCDC.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the recent}} years, the Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) {{techniques}} {{have emerged as}} an important research field for enhancing the throughput of in-home Power Line Communication (PLC) systems by exploiting the additional <b>Protective</b> <b>Earth</b> wire. The development of such systems requires an accurate description of the noise in the propagation channel. This paper presents two statistical models for the background noise found in MIMO PLC channels, based on noise measurements performed in five houses. In the proposed models, the spectral characteristics of MIMO background noise are presented, in 2 - 150 MHz range, following two existing formalisms for Single-Input Single-Output SISO) PLC noise...|$|R
40|$|Apart {{from being}} a safety arrangement, the <b>protective</b> <b>earth,</b> PE, is also defined as an {{equipotential}} plane {{which serves as a}} reference voltage for a circuit. Interest in the PE for EMC reasons is focused on an equipotential point. Still, most PE installation on site is carried out as a safety arrangement. In order to fulfill EMC standards regarding low emission, equipment is shielded and the shield is connected to the PE wire. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to show that electrical equipment distributes its electrical fields using the PE wire. Measurements have been taken on light fittings.
