5|$|The quadrille is a {{dance form}} {{that is an}} {{important}} symbol of French Antillean culture, not just in Dominica, but also Martinique, Guadeloupe and other Francophone islands. Dominican quadrilles are traditionally performed by four sets of couples in subscription picnics or dances, and in <b>private</b> <b>parties.</b> However, the quadrille tradition now only survives at holidays and festivals.|$|E

5|$|Citing {{the trust}} {{relationship}} between {{the federal government and}} the tribes, the Court held that removal treaties could only be enforced against the tribes by the federal government, not <b>private</b> <b>parties</b> (whether through self-help or through the courts). In other words, the federal government retained the discretion not to enforce such treaties. At the same time, the Court held that enrolled treaties are conclusively valid, and refused to consider the plaintiffs claim that the Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838) was fraudulent.|$|E

Ull instead used the Grand Hotel for its sixtieth anniversary in 1943 and the annual convention of 1944. Two new members were admitted during the war; Sverre Martens and Einar Poulsson.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey {{regulations}} for liquor stores and bars are extensive. Licensed establishments may not offer nudity. It {{is illegal to}} sell liquor below cost, charge a flat fee for unlimited drinks (except for <b>private</b> <b>parties</b> and on New Year's Eve), offer any promotion that is contingent on drinking {{a certain amount of}} alcohol, allow patrons to remain after closing time, or sell liquor at a drive-through window. Bars and clubs are prohibited from having a 'ladies' night' or any pricing which is regarded as discriminatory. Police officers are prohibited from working for licensed businesses in the same town where they are employed, and some municipalities require fingerprinting for all liquor store and bar employees.|$|E
50|$|It is most {{commonly}} used when a government brings a cause of action upon the request of a <b>private</b> <b>party</b> who has some interest in the matter. The <b>private</b> <b>party</b> is called the relator in such a case. The government acts {{on the basis of}} the narration or recounting (Latin relatione) of the alleged facts by the relator. Governments typically accept applications and commence litigation for ex rel. actions only if the interest advanced by the <b>private</b> <b>party</b> is similar to the interest of the government.|$|R

5|$|The smaller {{islands of}} Saint Martin, Saba and Sint Eustatius largely {{share in the}} same folk instruments, dances and songs as their neighbors; however, these islands remain largely unstudied. Saba {{is home to a}} vital percussive music tradition, most closely {{associated}} with <b>private</b> <b>parties,</b> using instrumentation similar to Curaçao, Bonaire and Aruba. Saint Martin is home to a national dance form called the ponum, which dates to the 19th century and was only displaced by string bands in the mid-20th century. Saint Martin is also home to a calypso-like quimbe song form, that remains {{a major part of the}} island's culture.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to prerogative orders, the equitable remedy of a declaration {{can be employed}} to control an excess of legal authority. A declaration is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. In contrast to the prerogative orders which are termed public law remedies, the declaration is called a private law remedy as it was originally developed in court cases between <b>private</b> <b>parties.</b> Only the High Court may grant declarations in judicial review cases; although the Subordinate Courts are generally empowered by the Subordinate Courts Act to grant declarations, a District Court exercises no judicial review jurisdiction over acts or decisions of persons or authorities, and a Magistrate's Court cannot deal with any action {{in which there is}} no claim for any sum of money.|$|E
5|$|Ownership of the {{continuous}} park blocks {{was not without}} dispute, however. After Lownsdale died without a will, and then his wife Nancy died, his estate challenged that his plat didn't require the central section to be dedicated to public use since Nancy had not signed over legal title to the land. The courts agreed in 1865. Benjamin Stark reneged on the donation of two north central park blocks to the city, instead offering to sell them for $138,000. Captain John H. Couch deeded his section, which became the North Park Blocks to the city on January 25, 1865, only ten days after receiving the federal patent for the land. Six of the South Park Blocks were lost to <b>private</b> <b>parties</b> in the 1870s, and elected city officials were unwilling to spend the asking price of $6,000 per block to purchase them so soon after the city had bought the land for Washington Park. Only a year later, a proposal to acquire the six blocks for $92,000 was brought by the city council, showing the increase in prices in that year.|$|E

5|$|The gardens {{were used}} daily for promenades and public breakfasts which were {{attended}} by Jane Austen among others. At public breakfasts tea, coffee, rolls and Sally Lunn buns were served at about midday, followed by dancing. There were generally three evening galas each summer, usually on the birthdays of George III and the Prince of Wales, and in July {{to coincide with}} the Bath races. During these galas the gardens were lit with thousands of lamps and the guests took supper accompanied by music and fireworks. Breakfasts, coffee-drinking, newspaper-reading and card-playing took place in the ground floor of the Hotel and dancing in a ballroom on the first floor. All the rooms could be hired for <b>private</b> <b>parties</b> and meetings. In September 1802 André-Jacques Garnerin took off from the gardens in his hot air balloon.|$|E
