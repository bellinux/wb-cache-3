In November 1945, a little before the collieries themselves were nationalised and vested in the National Coal Board, the towage business was sold to France, Fenwick Tyne and Wear Ltd which, after refurbishment, operated her at Sunderland on the River Wear until 1964. In 1952, the tug was modified slightly to obtain a <b>passenger</b> <b>certificate,</b> {{so that she could}} transport officials from newly built ships after they had completed their sea trials.|$|E

2500|$|Barratt, the boat's legal owner, professed {{ignorance of}} the {{arrangements}} made at Greatwood, believing, he said, that Bown had gone there to discuss with Rainbird future charter work once the necessary licences had been obtained. Under local regulations, a [...] licence for carrying up to 12 passengers was subject to examination of the boat by the harbourmaster, who would also require the person in charge to be a licensed skipper. Vessels proposing to carry more than 12 passengers needed a licensed master, a qualified marine engineer, and a Class III <b>Passenger</b> <b>Certificate</b> from the Board of Trade. This certificate was only granted to vessels in good condition with watertight hull compartments, a two-way radio, a qualified radio operator {{and a range of}} safety devices. Darlwyne had no radio, no distress flares, and carried only two lifebelts. Bown had apparently begun enquiries [...] with the Falmouth Harbour Commission, but neither he nor Darlwyne possessed any of the licences needed for the boat to operate commercially.|$|E

25|$|Flying boat {{services}} were resumed with American-built Consolidated PBY Catalinas on 10 July 1943, with flights between Swan River, Perth and Koggala lake in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka).

The 5,652km non-stop sector was the longest flown {{up to that time}} by any airline, with an average flying time of 28 hours. <b>Passengers</b> received a <b>certificate</b> of membership to The Rare and Secret Order of the Double Sunrise as the sun rose twice during the flight.|$|R

50|$|In her latter {{years she}} was mainly {{used as an}} {{excursion}} ship operating between Douglas and Liverpool.

50|$|Luna {{was built}} for Dampfschiffahrts Gesellschaft Neptun AG (Neptun Line). She had a <b>passenger</b> <b>certificate.</b> Her port of {{registry}} was Bremen and the Code Letters DOUV were allocated. In 1940, Luna was requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine. In 1942, she is recorded as no longer holding a <b>passenger</b> <b>certificate.</b> She was seized by the Allies at Eckernförde in May 1945 and passed to the MoWT, renamed Empire Concave.

In 1946, Empire Concave was allocated to Norway, and passed to the Norwegian Government. She was renamed Galtnes. In 1947, she was sold to Per T Lykke, Trondheim and renamed Ila.

50|$|In June 1944, Qantas Empire Airways began {{service with}} {{the first of two}} {{converted}} LB-30 Liberators on the Perth to Colombo route to augment Consolidated PBY Catalinas that had been used since May 1943. This route across the Indian Ocean was 3,513 mi long, the longest non-stop airline route in the world at the time. The Liberators flew a shorter 3,077 mi over-water route from Learmonth to an airfield northeast of Colombo, but they could make the flight in 17 hours with a 5,500 lb payload, whereas the Catalinas required 27 hours and had to carry so much auxiliary fuel that their payload was limited to only 1,000 lb. The route was named Kangaroo Service and marked the first time that Qantas's now-famous Kangaroo logo was used; <b>passengers</b> received a <b>certificate</b> proclaiming them as members of The Order of the Longest Hop. The Liberators were later replaced by Avro Lancastrians.|$|R
5000|$|Management diversified in {{the early}} 1970s into a {{broadcasting}} venture called PSA Broadcasting. Radio stations were purchased in Sacramento (96.9 KPSC later KEZC), San Jose (106.5 KEZD later KEZR), Los Angeles (107.5 KPSA later KLVE) and San Diego (102.9 KEZL now KLQV). All ran easy listening formats (hence EZ call letter combinations). The idea was to keep some of the airline's advertising dollars within the broadcasting company as well as collect some co-op (co-operative advertising) from businesses {{doing business with the}} airline. These stations were sold to various interests in the late 1970s. Throughout PSA's lifetime as an airline, the flight attendants, with their humor, over-the-top passenger service, and sense of duty, helped to create a loyal passenger following. One flight attendant, Sandy Daniels, {{with the help of a}} frequent flyer, started the [...] "Precious Stewardess Association". Frequent fliers would bring tasty treats to the crew, particularly on morning flights. In turn, PSA started the [...] "Precious <b>Passenger</b> Association", with <b>certificates</b> and free drinks given to friendly and helpful passengers.|$|R
50|$|A private naming and {{dedication}} ceremony {{took place on}} 17 September 2009 following the issuing of the <b>passenger</b> <b>certificate</b> after a trial evacuation of around 250 passengers.

50|$|Disaster struck on 2 June 1993. Instead {{of going}} astern onto the Victoria Pier in Douglas, she surged {{straight}} ahead {{and crashed into}} the Battery Pier, crumpling her bow. She was temporarily repaired, and issued with a lower <b>passenger</b> <b>certificate</b> to operate during TT, after which she was withdrawn for permanent repairs.

50|$|Loch Buies layout {{is similar}} to the {{original}} ‘Baby Loch’s’ of 1986 and 1987. Her car deck can take two lanes of cars, with a passenger lounge on each side. An additional lounge straddles the car deck, towards the bow. This produces a height restriction for vehicles and reduces her suitability for other routes where drive-through operation for high vehicles is required. The additional lounge means her <b>passenger</b> <b>certificate</b> allows up to 250 passengers.|$|E
