5|$|Polyethnicity {{refers to}} the {{proximity}} of <b>people</b> <b>from</b> <b>different</b> ethnic backgrounds within a country or other specific geographic region. It also relates to the ability and willingness of individuals to identify themselves with multiple ethnicities. It occurs when multiple ethnicities inhabit a given area, specifically through means of immigration, intermarriage, trade, conquest and post-war land-divisions. This has had many political and social implications on countries and regions.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{had been}} {{authorized}} by Congress to recruit {{an army of}} up to 28,501 troops, but he had only 19,000 when he reached New York. Military discipline was inadequate; routine orders were not carried out, muskets were fired in camp, flints were ruined, bayonets were used as knives to cut food, and firearm readiness was lax. Petty internal conflict was common under the strain {{of a large number}} of <b>people</b> <b>from</b> <b>different</b> environments and temperaments in relative closeness.|$|E
5|$|In Bandung, Hasan {{works for}} the Japanese {{occupation}} government and lives an ascetic lifestyle, often fasting {{for days on end}} and dunking himself into a river to refresh his body between evening and morning prayers. While there, he meets his childhood friend Rusli, who introduces Hasan to his friend Kartini. Seeing that Rusli and Kartini are atheistic Marxist-Leninists, Hasan considers it his duty to return them to Islam. However, he finds himself unable to address Rusli's arguments against religion and begins doubting his faith. Soon Hasan becomes increasingly divorced from his religious upbringing, at one time skipping the mandatory maghrib prayer to watch a movie with Kartini. Through Rusli, Hasan is introduced to <b>people</b> <b>from</b> <b>different</b> ideologies, including the anarcho-nihilist playboy Anwar; he also begins courting Kartini.|$|E
50|$|However, the seoks (tribes) of the Kumandins have varying origin myths; L.

5|$|Presently, most {{armed forces}} are {{composed}} of <b>people</b> <b>from</b> <b>different</b> ethnic backgrounds. They {{are considered to be}} polyethnic due to the differences in race, ethnicity, language or background. While there are many examples of polyethnic forces, the most prominent are among the largest armed forces in the world, including those of the United States, the former USSR and China. Polyethnic {{armed forces are}} not a new phenomenon; multi-ethnic forces have been in existence since the ancient Roman Empire, Middle Eastern Empires and even the Mongol Khans. The U.S. Military {{was one of the first}} modern militaries to begin ethnic integration, by order of President Truman in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The game went gold in {{the middle}} of October 2007. A demo was then {{released}} on November 8, 2007 on the PlayStation Network before its final release on November 19 in North America, December 6 in Australia, and December 7 in Europe. The demo was first placed on the North American store, and was initially region-locked such that it would only play on a North American PS3. However, this was later confirmed as a mistake, as the developers were apparently unaware that <b>people</b> <b>from</b> <b>different</b> regions could sign up for a North American account and download the demo; a region-free demo was released soon after.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, {{two summers}} before the Chicago riot, {{extensive}} and deadly race riots {{broke out in}} the expanding, war-time cities of East St. Louis, Illinois, and Houston, Texas, influencing the violent events of Red Summer across the nation and in Chicago. The postwar period also found tensions rising in numerous cities where populations were increasing rapidly. <b>People</b> <b>from</b> <b>different</b> cultures jostled against each other and competed for space. In 1917, the Chicago Real Estate Board established a policy of block by block segregation. New arrivals in the Great Migration generally joined old neighbors on the South Side. By 1920, the area held 85% of Chicago's African Americans--middle and upper class and poor. In the postwar period, veterans of all groups were looking to re-enter the work force. Some whites resented African-American veterans. At the same time, African-American veterans exhibited greater militancy and pride as a result of having served to protect their country. They expected to be treated as full citizens after fighting for the nation. Meanwhile, younger black men rejected the passivity traditional of the South and promoted armed self-defense and control of their neighborhoods.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{revolution in}} England and the tariff {{policies of the}} British also caused massive de-industrialization in other sectors throughout India and Mysore. For example, the gunny bag weaving business had been a monopoly of the Goniga people, which they lost when the British began ruling the area. The import of a chemical substitute for saltpetre (potassium nitrate) affected the Uppar community, the traditional makers of saltpetre for use in gunpowder. The import of kerosene affected the Ganiga community which supplied oils. Foreign enamel and crockery industries affected the native pottery business, and mill-made blankets replaced the country-made blankets called kambli. This economic fallout {{led to the formation}} of community-based social welfare organisations to help those within the community to cope better with their new economic situation, including youth hostels for students seeking education and shelter. However, the British economic policies created a class structure consisting of a newly established middle class comprising various blue and white-collared occupational groups, including agents, brokers, lawyers, teachers, civil servants and physicians. Due to a more flexible caste hierarchy, the middle class contained a heterogeneous mix of <b>people</b> <b>from</b> <b>different</b> castes.|$|E
