5|$|California native Chris Carter {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} to <b>produce</b> <b>new</b> shows for the Fox network in the early 1990s. Tired of the comedies he had been working on for Walt Disney Pictures, a report that 3.7 million Americans may have been abducted by aliens, the Watergate scandal and the 1970s horror series , triggered the idea for The X-Files. He wrote the pilot episode in 1992.|$|E

5|$|In {{some species}} of RNA virus, the genes {{are not on}} a {{continuous}} molecule of RNA, but are separated. The influenza virus, for example, has eight separate genes made of RNA. When two different strains of influenza virus infect the same cell, these genes can mix and <b>produce</b> <b>new</b> strains of the virus in a process called reassortment.|$|E
5|$|Spiral galaxies, {{like the}} Milky Way, <b>produce</b> <b>new</b> generations of stars {{as long as}} they have dense {{molecular}} clouds of interstellar hydrogen in their spiral arms. Elliptical galaxies are largely devoid of this gas, and so form few new stars. The supply of star-forming material is finite; once stars have converted the available supply of hydrogen into heavier elements, new star formation will come to an end.|$|E

5|$|The Shield nickel {{series has}} yielded {{a large number}} of varieties. Howard Spindel, a leading expert on Shield nickels, notes that Shield nickel dies {{produced}} far fewer coins than other coin dies, as the dies wore out so fast that the Mint was continually under great pressure to <b>produce</b> <b>new</b> ones. According to Spindel, many dies were hastily and carelessly produced, producing numerous minor varieties.|$|E
5|$|The angular {{value of}} the {{obliquity}} is found by observation of the motions of Earth and other planets over many years. Astronomers <b>produce</b> <b>new</b> fundamental ephemerides as the accuracy of observation improves and as {{the understanding of the}} dynamics increases, and from these ephemerides various astronomical values, including the obliquity, are derived.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{progressive}} alignment method called T-Coffee is {{slower than}} Clustal and its derivatives but generally produces more accurate alignments for distantly related sequence sets. T-Coffee calculates pairwise alignments {{by combining the}} direct alignment of the pair with indirect alignments that aligns each sequence of the pair to a third sequence. It uses the output from Clustal as well as another local alignment program LALIGN, which finds multiple regions of local alignment between two sequences. The resulting alignment and phylogenetic tree are used {{as a guide to}} <b>produce</b> <b>new</b> and more accurate weighting factors.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, {{after the end}} of the Second World War, Hergé was {{continuing}} to <b>produce</b> <b>new</b> instalments of The Adventures of Tintin for the Belgian magazine Tintin, of which he was the artistic director. After completing serialisation of Prisoners of the Sun in April 1949, he ordered his staff to re-serialise one of his old stories, Popol and Virginia, while he took a three-month break. At this point, Hergé was depressed and suffering from a range of physical ailments, including boils and eczema on his hands. Although fed up with The Adventures of Tintin, he felt great pressure on him to continue producing the series for Tintin magazine.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{essential}} to life. Cells <b>produce</b> <b>new</b> protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. Protein synthesis consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.|$|E
5|$|The {{generation}} of new genes can also involve small parts of several genes being duplicated, with these fragments then recombining to form new combinations with new functions. When new genes are assembled from shuffling pre-existing parts, domains act as modules with simple independent functions, {{which can be}} mixed together to <b>produce</b> <b>new</b> combinations with new and complex functions. For example, polyketide synthases are large enzymes that make antibiotics; they contain up to one hundred independent domains that each catalyse one step in the overall process, like a step in an assembly line.|$|E

5|$|The team at RIKEN has {{listed the}} {{synthesis}} of element 121 among their future plans after their attempts to synthesise element 120 in 2017–2018 and element 119 in 2019–2020. Their attempts at the latter two involve targets of 248Cm with projectiles of 54Cr and 51V respectively; the reaction of 248Cm with 55Mn would produce the same isotopes of element 121 as the JINR's suggested reaction of 249Bk with 54Cr in the 3n (300Ubu) and 4n (299Ubu) channels. Before this, the RIKEN team had successfully produced livermorium (element 116) in the fusion of 248Cm with 48Ca, and will next try to <b>produce</b> <b>new</b> isotopes of oganesson (element 118) in the fusion of 248Cm with 50Ti.|$|E
5|$|An area {{of current}} {{investigation}} in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations. This research addresses {{the origin and}} evolution of embryonic development and how modifications of development and developmental processes produce novel features. These {{studies have shown that}} evolution can alter development to <b>produce</b> <b>new</b> structures, such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part of the middle ear in mammals. It is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due to changes in developmental genes, such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles. It is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to changes in a small set of conserved genes.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of clergy was {{severely}} limited, Soegijapranata roamed from church to church to attend to parishioners, actively preaching and serving as the de facto head of the Catholic Church in the country; this was in part to counteract rumours of his detention by the Japanese. He travelled by foot, bicycle, and carriage, as his car had been seized. He sent pastors to apostolic prefectures in Bandung, Surabaya, and Malang {{to deal with the}} lack of clergy there. Soegijapranata worked to ensure that the seminary would continue to <b>produce</b> <b>new</b> pastors and appointed the recently ordained Father Hardjawasita as its rector. He also granted native priests the authority to perform marriages. To calm the Catholic populace, he visited their homes and convinced them that the streets were safe.|$|E

5|$|Cortisol is {{the main}} {{glucocorticoid}} in humans. In species that do not create cortisol, this role is played by corticosterone instead. Glucocorticoids have many effects on metabolism. As their name suggests, they increase the circulating level of glucose. This {{is the result of}} an increase in the mobilization of amino acids from protein and the stimulation of synthesis of glucose from these amino acids in the liver. In addition, they increase the levels of free fatty acids, which cells can use as an alternative to glucose to obtain energy. Glucocorticoids also have effects unrelated to the regulation of blood sugar levels, including the suppression of the immune system and a potent anti-inflammatory effect. Cortisol reduces the capacity of osteoblasts to <b>produce</b> <b>new</b> bone tissue and decreases the absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|From 1919 to 1922, Kesselring {{served as}} a battery {{commander}} with the 24th Artillery Regiment. He joined the Reichswehr on 1 October 1922 and was posted to the Military Training Department at the Reichswehr Ministry in Berlin. He remained at this post until 1929, {{when he returned to}} Bavaria as commander of Wehrkreis VII in Munich. In his time with the Reichswehr Ministry, Kesselring was involved in the organisation of the army, trimming staff overheads to produce the best possible army with the limited resources available. He helped reorganise the Ordnance Department, laying the groundwork for the research and development efforts that would <b>produce</b> <b>new</b> weapons. He was involved in secret military manoeuvres held in the Soviet Union in 1924 and in the so-called Great Plan for a 102-division army, which was prepared in 1923 and 1924. After another brief stint at the Ministry of the Reichswehr, Kesselring was promoted to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) in 1930 and spent two years in Dresden with the 4th Artillery Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Many viruses can be {{synthesised}} de novo ("from scratch") and {{the first}} synthetic virus was created in 2002. Although somewhat of a misconception, {{it is not the}} actual virus that is synthesised, but rather its DNA genome (in case of a DNA virus), or a cDNA copy of its genome (in case of RNA viruses). For many virus families the naked synthetic DNA or RNA (once enzymatically converted back from the synthetic cDNA) is infectious when introduced into a cell. That is, they contain all the necessary information to <b>produce</b> <b>new</b> viruses. This technology is now being used to investigate novel vaccine strategies. The ability to synthesise viruses has far-reaching consequences, since viruses can no longer be regarded as extinct, as long as the information of their genome sequence is known and permissive cells are available. , the full-length genome sequences of 3843 different viruses, including smallpox, are publicly available in an online database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.|$|E
