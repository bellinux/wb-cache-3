5|$|Park Lane is {{the second}} most {{valuable}} <b>property</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> London edition of the board game Monopoly. The street had a prestigious social status when the British version of the Monopoly board was first produced, in 1936.

The squares were designed to be equivalents of Park Place and Boardwalk, respectively, on the original board, which used streets in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In 1988, the World Monopoly Championships were held at the Park Lane Hotel, sponsored by Waddingtons, manufacturers of the British version. Since the game's original production, prices on the real Park Lane have held their value, though average rent costs have been overtaken by Bond Street.|$|E
