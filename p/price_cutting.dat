5|$|While Burger King's {{advertising}} {{programs were}} highly focused on its new product, {{most of the}} company's sales gains {{were the result of}} aggressive <b>price</b> <b>cutting</b> by Burger King, specifically pricing its signature Whopper sandwich at 99¢, according to analysts at Salomon Brothers. The <b>price</b> <b>cutting</b> promotions by Burger King, and number-three chain Wendy's, forced McDonald's into its own <b>price</b> <b>cutting</b> program. According to Salomon, the burger segment's price wars would have a detrimental effect on the profits of segment leaders, allowing other smaller chains such as Sonic Drive-In, Jack in the Box and Carl's Jr to position themselves as attractive alternatives to the big three chains.|$|E
25|$|Result: Odyssey {{decided on}} a 1940s theme at a premium price, while Platinum went with a theme based around Alice in Wonderland and the Mad Hatter's tea party, and much cheaper pricing. Things {{generally}} went smoothly on Odyssey, {{though there was a}} major argument between Alice and Maria over the pricing, as Alice wanted to offer discounts for senior citizens, while Maria felt everyone should pay full price. They struggled to attract customers as the day went on, and had to resort to slashing prices as the task drew to a close. Despite the <b>price</b> <b>cutting,</b> it only managed to pull in 2 extra customers. On Platinum, David had trouble effectively leading the team, which resulted in Ashleigh making a lot of the decisions: on the second day, their tea service rapidly descended into chaos, with David still struggling to lead the team, and customers failing to be served in a timely manner. However, the service smoothed out as the day progressed and they took over £100 more than Odyssey. Despite their better overall execution of the task, Odyssey spent £100 more money, which proved decisive in the end figures. Odyssey had a profit of £91, and Platinum had a profit of £316, more than 3 times the amount of Odyssey.|$|E

Myra thought that the health of the magazine depended on the effective functioning of three key areas of operation: editorial, circulation, and advertising.|$|R

The price reflected the [...] market price, and the purpose of the order was to prevent <b>price</b> <b>cutting.</b> Nevertheless, the public suspected that the board's intent was to benefit dairy dealers, instead of farmers, because the minimum prices for the two sides were not the same. Tensions ran so high that violent milk strikes took place throughout the state, with two deaths and a great amount of property damage. Every public hearing of the Milk Control Board resulted in a [...] "tumultuous, popular assemblage" [...] and its every action was [...] "Statewide news." ...|$|E

30|$|Second, {{we look at}} firms’ {{reaction}} to rises {{in the minimum wage}} as a combination of strategies and report a preference ranking for the adjustment channels in the CEE 8. Such information is not available in other studies due to their concentration on a single transmission channel, most frequently layoffs. More than 90 % of the subsample of firms which employ workers at the minimum wage responded {{that at least one of}} the six adjustment channels proposed was relevant. The most popular adjustment channels are raising product <b>prices,</b> <b>cutting</b> non-labour costs, and improving productivity, which more resembles the theoretical outcome predicted by the institutional model. The ranking of the channels remains robust to a range of different estimation procedures and variable specifications.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the use of}} real earnings management in a setting where earnings manipulation {{is likely to have}} occurred. Using firms subject to SEC Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases, I find that misstating firms show lower discretionary SG&A but higher discretionary R&D than the control sample in the years in which they overstate earnings. I then investigate whether this result is explained by heightened management incentives to support stock prices. I find evidence consistent with investors overvaluing high discretionary R&D and low discretionary SG&A during misstatement years. Overall, these results suggest that while cutting SG&A is considered a feasible earnings management tool to inflate earnings and stock <b>prices,</b> <b>cutting</b> R&D is not a viable option in a setting where managers desire to signal growth and maintain high stock market valuations...|$|R

25|$|Saddam pushed oil-exporting {{countries}} to raise oil <b>prices</b> by <b>cutting</b> back production; Kuwait refused, however.

25|$|France, Italy, and the Netherlands lowered {{taxes in}} 2000 in {{response}} to protests over high prices, but other European nations resisted this option because public service financiation is partly based on energy taxes. The issue came up again in 2004, when oil reached $40 a barrel causing a meeting of 25 EU finance ministers to lower economic growth forecasts for that year. Because of budget deficits in several countries, they decided to pressure OPEC to lower prices instead of lowering taxes. In 2007, European truckers, farmers, and fishermen again raised concerns over record oil <b>prices</b> <b>cutting</b> into their earnings, hoping to have taxes lowered. In the United Kingdom, where fuel taxes were raised in October and were scheduled to rise again in April 2008, {{there was talk of}} protests and roadblocks if the tax issue was not addressed.

50|$|When Ultronics {{introduced}} their Stockmaster desk {{units in}} 1961 they priced the service at {{approximately the same}} price as the Quotron desk units. They did not want a price competition only a performance competition. All of these stock quote devices were sold on leases with monthly rental charges. The cost of the system, desk units and installation was therefore born solely by the vendor not the customer (broker). The pricing at that time made the units quite profitable and allowed the companies to finance the cost and use rapid accounting depreciation of the equipment. In 1964 Teleregister introduced their Telequote desk units at prices significantly less than Stockmaster or Quotron. This forced Ultronics and Scantlin to reduce the prices of their Stockmaster and Quotron systems. The Telequote desk units never did gain a significant share of the desk top quotation business, but their <b>price</b> <b>cutting</b> did seriously reduce the overall profitability of this business in the U.S.. Ultronics was fortunate to have made the joint venture arrangement with Reuters for the stock quotation business outside of North America where this <b>price</b> <b>cutting</b> was not a factor.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{economic}} developments highlight Latin America`s {{vulnerability to}} {{economic and financial}} turmoil that is triggered by events in distant corners of the globe. The Asian financial crisis that began in 1997 and the more recent Russian crisis have left the region profoundly shaken, and living in fear of a full-scale collapse. This contagion has occurred {{through a number of}} channels. The collapse of Asian demand has contributed to the recent slide in world commodity <b>prices,</b> <b>cutting</b> into the commodity-dependent region`s export income and undermining the public finances in a number of countries. The Russian devaluation has raised the spectre of sovereign default, making investors around the globe more wary of increasing their cross-border exposure. The financial crises in Asia and Russia have also severely undermined balance sheets of emerging-market investors, reducing their capacity to invest in the region, and forcing them into fire sales of their Latin American investments. In this paper we lay out the fiscal and financial policies that can help protect economies from the kind of global financial turbulence the world is now experiencing. Exchange rate policies are discussed in a separate paper...|$|R
