40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a new aircraft tyre model applied using a co-simulation approach for the multibody dynamic simulation of helicopter ground vehicle dynamics. The new tyre model is presented using a <b>point</b> <b>follower</b> approach that makes a novel contribution to this area by uniquely combining elements of two existing tyre models used by the aircraft industry, namely the NASA R 64 model developed by Smiley and Horne and the Engineering Sciences Data Unit (ESDU) Mitchell tyre model. Before the tyre model was used with a full helicopter model, a virtual tyre test rig was used to examine the tyre and to predict the tyre forces and moments for a range of tyre states. The paper concludes by describing the successful application of the new tyre model with a full helicopter model and the simulation of representative landing, take-off and runway taxiing manoeuvres. The predictive capability of the model is demonstrated to show the open-loop ground vehicle dynamics response of the helicopter and also the ground load predictive capability for the distribution of loads through the tyres, wheels and landing gears...|$|E

50|$|The {{new feature}} of Wheel of Fortune is the namesake wheel, which takes {{the place of}} the {{starting}} tile. The wheel consists of a number of spaces, and players, in place of placing followers on the tile they just played, may place tiles on spaces along the rim of the wheel. Each space on the wheel may have one or two spaces on the rim. In addition, a pig-shaped marker begins on the wheel, and is moved whenever a tiles with certain markings are drawn. When these tiles are drawn, the marker is advanced clockwise along the wheel the number of spaces stated on the tile. The space on the wheel is resolved, and followers {{on the rim of the}} particular space are scored, before the tile is placed. Wheel effects include scoring by all players for certain types of followers (including unplayed followers), scoring by only the player on move, or the removal of a follower on the board (except on the wheel) by all players. Followers on the wheel score three points, except when there is only one follower on a wheel space that has two spaces on the rim, in which the <b>follower</b> scores six <b>points.</b> <b>Followers</b> on the wheel at the end of the game are not worth any <b>points.</b> Once scored, <b>followers</b> on the wheel are returned to their owners.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the controller design for combined lateral and longitudinal Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) for a unicycle-type platoon {{with emphasis on}} the cornering maneuvers. A decentralized controller for lateral and longitudinal behavior is designed using input-output linearization by static feedback. A preceding vehicle look-ahead approach is adapted in the controller to maintain desired inter-vehicle distance. However, due to the position control of the look-ahead <b>point,</b> the <b>follower</b> vehicle may cut corners on turns. In this paper, the extension of a look-ahead point that is able to compensate the cutting-corner behavior is then proposed. To validate the theoretical analysis, the full nonlinear system together with the developed controller is simulated for two scenarios, a circular path and a particular path scenario, and a comparison is made between the system with the preceding vehicle look-ahead and the extended look-ahead. The simulation shows that the proposed lateral and longitudinal controller using the extended look-ahead eliminates the cutting corner behavior...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the issues}} related to {{formation}} flights, which requires to be still discussed, is the stability of formation flight in turns, where the aerodynamic conditions can be substantially different for outer vehicles due to varying bank angles.

But opposite to other research in this area, {{the structure of the}} formation becomes flexible (structure is being reshaped and bent according to actual turn radius of the leader. During turns the structure is bent basing on concentred circles with different radiuses corresponding to relative locations of vehicles in the structure.

The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by the results of simulated flights of five UAVs...|$|R

This was achieved through the analysis of two biggest competitors on the market of confectionery products of the Republic of Serbia, using secondary data analysis.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we derive {{a set of}} {{constraints}} that are sufficient to guarantee maintained connectivity in a leader-follower multiagent network with proximity based communication topology.

In the paper we show that we can maintain the initial network structure, and thereby connectivity, by setting up bounds on the ratio of leaders-to-followers and on the magnitude of the goal attraction force experienced by the leaders. The results are first established for an initially complete communication graph and then extended to an incomplete graph. The results are illustrated by computer simulations. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} brand firms' endogenous timing {{problem when}} facing nonbrand firms under quantity competition. We study a market comprising brand and nonbrand products. There exist heterogeneous consumer groups-one group buys only brand products {{while the other}} one cares little about the brand. These two consumer groups constitute the high- and low-end markets respectively. The brand firms' moving order is endogenized, whereas the nonbrand firms are restricted to move in a later period. We show that if the low-end market is of an intermediate size, the leader-follower equilibrium outcome occurs, and the follower obtains second mover advantage which diminishes {{when the number of}} nonbrand firms increases. These results follow from the fact that each brand firm's best response function has an upward jump if the rival's output exceeds a particular level. Thus, the leader's profit function has a downward jump at some particular <b>point</b> while the <b>follower's</b> profit does not...|$|R

50|$|Taking {{advantage}} of this, he fled {{the capital to}} Adrianople on September 14, 1047. There he gathered his supporters {{and a number of}} disgruntled generals and raised them in revolt against Emperor Constantine's misgovernment. Proclaiming himself emperor, he marched against the capital with his forces and set up his camp opposite the Walls of Constantinople on September 25, 1047. An ad hoc force of armed citizens who sallied out to meet him was easily defeated. This victory spread panic to the capital's defenders, who momentarily abandoned their posts on the walls and their gates. Tornikios, however, hesitated, and lost the opportunity to take the city, for that night, Emperor Constantine managed to restore order and re-occupy the walls, awaiting the arrival of the Anatolian army. The siege lasted four days, from September 25 until September 28. Two assaults of Tornikios's men on the walls were turned back by the defenders under the personal leadership of Emperor Constantine, who, despite suffering from gout and having no military experience, showed courage and energy in this extremity. Following the failure of his assaults, Tornikios was forced to withdraw westwards. Hoping to retrieve the situation he attacked Rhaidestos, but was again repulsed. At this <b>point,</b> his <b>followers</b> started to abandon him. He found refuge in a church at Boulgarophygon, but was lured out of it and captured.
