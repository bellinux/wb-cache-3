5|$|In 1933, the {{government}} brought the UERL and the Metropolitan Railway {{together as a}} single organisation, the London Passenger Transport Board. The London Underground has since <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> series of administrations, expanding further by {{the construction of new}} extensions and through the acquisition of existing main line routes, culminating in its current form as part of Transport for London, the capital's current transport administration, controlled by the Greater London Authority.|$|E
5|$|It was {{surveyed}} in 1854 by Ontario's deputy surveyor, Charles Rankin, {{to provide a}} short route between the undeveloped Sydenham (now Owen Sound) and Hepworth townsites. This route <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> large swamp {{and as a result}} remained an unimproved one lane trail up until the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|The {{interaction}} {{of stars in}} the collapsed core region causes tight binary systems to form. As other stars interact with these tight binaries, they increase the energy at the core, which causes the cluster to re-expand. As the mean time for a core collapse is typically less than {{the age of the}} galaxy, many of a galaxy's globular clusters may have <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> core collapse stage, then re-expanded.|$|E
5|$|When {{the station}} was first opened in 1838 by the North Union Railway, the line north of the station <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> tunnel under {{the west end of}} Fishergate (then Preston’s major thoroughfare). It was on a slope so steep that {{sometimes}} station staff had to push trains out of the station.|$|E
5|$|Designed both to {{accelerate}} future elections and reduce outside interference, {{the rules of}} Ubi periculum provide for the cardinal electors to be secluded for {{the entirety of the}} conclave, including having their meals <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> small opening, and for their rations to be reduced to a single meal at the end of three days, or bread and water (with a little wine) after eight days. Cardinals also do not collect from the Apostolic Camera any payments they might otherwise receive during the conclave.|$|E
50|$|Exhaust {{gas from}} each gas turbine <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> {{individual}} CMI {{heat recovery steam generator}} (HRSG). For Phase 1 the steam <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> ABB steam turbine connected to an ABB 50WT hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator. For Phase 2 the steam <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> ABB steam turbine connected to an ABB WY21 TEWAC (air-water-cooled) turbogenerator. The Phase 1 generator {{is larger than}} Phase 2 so needs to be cooled by hydrogen gas.|$|R
5000|$|... e < 0: A COR {{less than}} zero would {{represent}} a collision in which the separation velocity of the objects has the same direction (sign) as the closing velocity, implying the objects <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> one another without fully engaging. This may also {{be thought of as}} an incomplete transfer of momentum. An example of this might be a small, dense object <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> large, less dense one - e.g., <b>a</b> bullet <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> target, or <b>a</b> motorcycle <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> motor home or <b>a</b> wave tearing <b>through</b> <b>a</b> dam.|$|R

5|$|During their {{approach}} to Guadalcanal, the Japanese force <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> large and intense rain squall which, along with a complex formation plus some confusing orders from Abe, split the formation into several groups. The U.S. force steamed in a single column in Ironbottom Sound, with destroyers in the lead and rear of the column, and the cruisers in the center. Five ships had the new, far-superior SG radar, but Callaghan's deployment put none {{of them in the}} forward part of the column, nor did he choose one for his flagship. Callaghan did not issue a battle plan to his ship commanders.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{from studies}} of {{mitochondrial}} DNA suggests that humans may have <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> genetic bottleneck around this time that reduced genetic diversity below what would be expected given {{the age of the}} species. According to the Toba catastrophe theory, proposed by Stanley H. Ambrose of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1998, the effects of the Toba eruption may have decreased the size of human populations to only a few tens of thousands of individuals. However, this hypothesis is not widely accepted because similar effects on other animal species have not been observed, and paleoanthropology suggests there was no population bottleneck.|$|E
5|$|Extending this work, Nirenberg and Philip Leder {{revealed}} the code's triplet nature and deciphered its codons. In these experiments, various combinations of mRNA were <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> filter that contained ribosomes, {{the components of}} cells that translate RNA into protein. Unique triplets promoted the binding of specific tRNAs to the ribosome. Leder and Nirenberg were able to determine the sequences of 54 out of 64 codons in their experiments. Khorana, Holley and Nirenberg received the 1968 Nobel for their work.|$|E

50|$|The {{first route}} to be {{considered}} was a branch line from Epuni, climbing {{the side of the}} hills in the Hutt Valley, and <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> tunnel near the present hill road before dropping into the Wainuiomata Valley. The ruling grade would have been about 1:60, and would possibly have required a second short tunnel to <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> spur. Negative points for this option included the fact that it would have to <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> appreciable amount of developed land, and a requirement for heavy earthworks.|$|R
5|$|In 2001, a {{temporary}} visitor security screening center {{was added to}} the east entrance of the Washington Monument {{in the wake of the}} September 11 attacks. The one-story facility was designed to reduce the ability of a terrorist attack on the interior of the monument, or an attempt to seize and hold it. Visitors obtained their timed-entry tickets from the Monument Lodge east of the memorial, and passed through metal detectors and bomb-sniffing sensors prior to entering the monument. After exiting the monument, they <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> turnstile to prevent them from re-entering. This facility, a one-story cube of wood around a metal frame, was intended to be temporary until a new screening facility could be designed.|$|E
5|$|It {{soon came}} time to name the new highway, and an {{upcoming}} visit by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth {{proved to be the}} focal point for a dedication ceremony. On June7, 1939, the two royal family members drove along the highway (which now connected to Niagara Falls) and <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> light beam near the Henley Bridge in St. Catharines. This caused two Union Jacks to swing out, revealing a sign which read The Queen Elizabeth Way.|$|E
5|$|The Stern–Gerlach {{experiment}} of 1922 provided {{further evidence}} of the quantum nature of the atom. When a beam of silver atoms was <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split based on the direction of an atom's angular momentum, or spin. As this direction is random, the beam could be expected to spread into a line. Instead, the beam was split into two parts, depending on whether the atomic spin was oriented up or down.|$|E

50|$|From US 31, SR 18 heads east towards Converse <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> {{concurrency}} with State Road 19. SR 18 then heads through Converse, after Converse SR 18 has a concurrency with State Road 13. SR 18 turns southeast towards Marion <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> Sweetser. In Marion eastbound SR 18 is on a Fourth Street and westbound SR 18 is on Third Street and Second Street. East of Marion {{the one-way}} streets become a four-lane highway. SR 18 heads east towards Montpelier <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> interchange with I-69 and <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> intersection with State Road 5 and State Road 3. East of Montpelier SR 18 <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> intersection with State Road 1. Then SR 18 heads east towards its eastern terminus near Bryant at an intersection with US 27 and SR 67, from this intersection SR 67 heads east towards Ohio.|$|R

5|$|Turbulence {{and dynamic}} {{forces in the}} {{heliosphere}} cannot affect {{the shape of the}} solar corona within, because the information can only travel at the speed of Alfvén waves. The solar wind travels outward continuously through the heliosphere, forming the solar magnetic field into a spiral shape, until it impacts the heliopause more than 50 AU from the Sun. In December 2004, the Voyager 1 probe <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> shock front that is thought {{to be part of the}} heliopause. In late 2012 Voyager 1 recorded a marked increase in cosmic ray collisions and a sharp drop in lower energy particles from the solar wind, which suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause and entered the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{part of the}} Diocese of Lincoln, {{it served}} what was {{historically}} the largest parish in Buckinghamshire, and the church traditionally had two vicars. Initially the advowson (the right to appoint the vicar) was held jointly {{by a pair of}} prominent local families, but {{in the wake of the}} 12th century civil wars of the reign of King Stephen(1135–1154), the advowsons were granted to the monks of Woburn Abbey and to the Abbey of Saint Mary de Pratis in Leicester, each of whom appointed their own vicars to the parish. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries Woburn Abbey, together with its half of the advowson, was granted to the Earls of Bedford, while the half that had belonged to Leicester Abbey <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> succession of private owners. In 1769 the Duke of Bedford acquired the Leicester half of the advowson and unified the parish, and from then on the parish was served by a single vicar.|$|E
5|$|In the {{particular}} {{version of the}} experiment shown here, Hoek used a prism P to disperse light from a slit into a spectrum which <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> collimator C before entering the apparatus. With the apparatus oriented parallel to the hypothetical aether wind, Hoek expected the light in one circuit to be retarded 7/600mm {{with respect to the}} other. Where this retardation represented an integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see constructive interference; where this retardation represented a half-integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see destructive interference. In the absence of dragging, his expectation was for the observed spectrum to be continuous with the apparatus oriented transversely to the aether wind, and to be banded with the apparatus oriented parallel to the aether wind. His actual experimental results were completely negative.|$|E
50|$|Static timing {{analysis}} tries {{to figure out}} the best and worst case time estimate for each signal as they <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> electronic device. Whenever <b>a</b> signal <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> node, a bit of uncertainty must be added to the time required for the signal to transit that device. These uncertain delays add up so, after <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> many devices, the worst-case timing for a signal could be unreasonably pessimistic.|$|R

5|$|LACM 149371 (Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County {{specimen}} 149371) is {{an enigmatic}} fossil mammalian tooth from the Paleogene (66 to 23 million years ago, mya) of Peru. It {{is from the}} Santa Rosa fossil site, which is of uncertain age but possibly late Eocene (55 to 34 mya) or Oligocene (34 to 23 mya). The tooth is poorly preserved {{and may have been}} degraded by acidic water or because it <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> predator's digestive tract. Its largest dimension is 2.65mm. It is triangular in shape and bears six cusps that surround the middle of the tooth, where there are three basins (fossae). Crests connects the cusps and separate the fossae. The microscopic structure of the enamel is poorly preserved.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium {{compounds}} {{are sometimes}} used in fireworks {{to give them}} a purple color. Rubidium has also been considered for use in a thermoelectric generator using the magnetohydrodynamic principle, where rubidium ions are formed by heat at high temperature and <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> magnetic field. These conduct electricity and act like an armature of a generator thereby generating an electric current. Rubidium, particularly vaporized 87Rb, {{is one of the most}} commonly used atomic species employed for laser cooling and Bose–Einstein condensation. Its desirable features for this application include the ready availability of inexpensive diode laser light at the relevant wavelength, and the moderate temperatures required to obtain substantial vapor pressures. For cold atom applications requiring tunable interactions, 85Rb is preferable due to its rich Feshbach spectrum.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of a von Neumann computer depended {{on the availability of}} a suitable memory device on which to store the program. During the Second World War researchers working on the problem of removing the clutter from radar signals had developed a form of delay line memory, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line, developed by J. Presper Eckert. Radar transmitters send out regular brief pulses of radio energy, the reflections from which are displayed on a CRT screen. As operators are usually interested only in moving targets, it was desirable to filter out any distracting reflections from stationary objects. The filtering was achieved by comparing each received pulse with the previous pulse, and rejecting both if they were identical, leaving a signal containing only the images of any moving objects. To store each received pulse for later comparison it was <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> transmission line, delaying it by exactly the time between transmitted pulses.|$|E
