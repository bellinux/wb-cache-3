In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{stability}} of the characteristic curves for nonlinear resistive circuits including <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements</b> <b>1.</b> Although the DC solution is determined by analyzing the nonlinear resistive circuit, its equilibrium point will be stable or unstable be-cause every resistive element has a small parasitic component in practice. We consider here two parasitic elements: a capacitor between every resistor node and ground, and an inductor in series with each resistor. Of course, the stability can be decided by solving the varia-tional equation at each equilibrium point obtained by the DC analysis, however, this is very time-consuming. We show here that the stability is mainly changed at the boundary of the presence of negative differential resistance (NDR) and the bifurcation points such as turning and pitchfork points on the DC characteristic curves, so that the instability regions of the solution curve are easily found by both the locations of bifurcation points and NDR regions of the nonlinear resistors. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} electronic beam steering for a smart antenna system based on a switched parasitic array. The antenna system {{is made up of}} circular array of half wave dipoles, with four <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements</b> positioned equidistantly, surrounding one active central <b>element.</b> All <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements</b> are assumed to be switched between short-circuit and opencircuit states to change their resonant length. The switching between parasitic elementsâ€™ states is attained by connecting a switch that assumes ON/OFF states at the centre of each <b>parasitic</b> <b>element.</b> This allows some <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements</b> to act as reflectors while shortcircuited, whereas other <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements</b> act as directors when open-circuited. Thus, the direction of maximum gain is controlled by open- and shortcircuiting the <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements.</b> By appropriately selecting correct combination of short- and opencircuited <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements</b> together with the active element, a set of radiation patterns is formed covering the horizontal plane. Results for the horizontal coverage are presented with the main beam(s) directed at 00, 900, 1800, and/or 2700, as well as for an omnidirectional configuration resemblance. It is expected that increasing the number of <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements</b> will improve directional properties further...|$|R

The size of ground plane of the proposed PIFA is 50 x 30 mm which has been reduced by 50 % from the size of conventional PIFA. This can be achieved by adjusting the width and the height of shorting plate. The SB-PIFA operates at 2. 6 GHz for LTE Application. In DB-PIFA, two frequency spectrums operating at 2. 6 GHz and 3. 5 GHz frequency band for LTE and WiMAX application has been proposed. The dual-band operation is obtained after introducing a rectangular shape <b>parasitic</b> <b>element</b> togenerate new resonant frequency at 3. 5 GHz. The best location of <b>parasitic</b> <b>element</b> is placed on the right edge of the ground plane due to the existing of high current distribution. Meanwhile, the third design TB-PIFA operating at 2. 1 GHz for UMTS 2100, 2. 6 GHz (LTE) and 3. 5 GHz (WiMAX) frequency band is presented. This design adopted the same technique as the DB-PIFA to generate triple-band frequencies, where one more <b>parasitic</b> <b>element</b> is added and placed at the left edge of the ground plane.
