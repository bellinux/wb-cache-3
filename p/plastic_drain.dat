40|$|Steam {{and soil}} {{solarization}} were investigated {{for control of}} the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne arenaria in 2 yr of field trials on a commercial flower farm in Florida. The objective was to determine if preplant steam treatments in combination with solarization, or solarization alone effectively controlled nematodes compared to methyl bromide (MeBr). Trials were conducted in a field with naturally occurring populations of M. arenaria. Treatments were solarization alone, steam treatment after solarization using standard 7. 6 -cm-diameter perforated <b>plastic</b> <b>drain</b> tile (steam 1), steam treatment following solarization using custom-drilled <b>plastic</b> <b>drain</b> tile with 1. 6 -mm holes spaced every 3. 8 cm (steam 2), and MeBr applied at 392 kg/ha 80 : 20 MeBr:chloropicrin. Drain tiles were buried approximately 35 cm deep with four tiles per 1. 8 by 30 m plot. Steam application followed a 4 -wk solarization period concluding in mid-October. All steam was generated using a Sioux propane boiler system. Plots were steamed for sufficient time to reach the target temperature of 708 C for 20 min. Solarization plastic was retained on the plots during steaming and plots were covered with a single layer of carpet padding to provide additional insulation. The floriculture crops larkspur (Delphinium elatum and Delphinium X belladonna), snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus) were produced according to standard commercial practices. One month after treatment in both years of the study, soil populations of M. arenaria were lower in both steam treatments and in MeBr compared to solarization alone. At {{the end of the season}} in both years, galling on larkspur, snapdragon, and sunflowers was lower in both steam treatments than in solarization. Both steam treatments also provided control of M. arenaria in soil at the end of the season comparable to, or exceeding that provided by MeBr. Both steam treatments also reduced M. arenaria in snapdragon roots comparable to, or exceeding control with MeBr. Meloidogyne arenaria in soil increased in solarization alone. Solarization alone also had higher gall ratings on larkspur, snapdragon, and sunflower than all other treatments. Steam provided excellent control of M. arenaria in this study...|$|E

40|$|One {{year after}} {{draining}} and extensively loosening heavy-clay soils, irrigation water was sprinkled over it daily for 10 h for a 3 -day period, using a 10 mm h- 1 rate, perpendicularly over <b>plastic</b> <b>drains.</b> Five {{days after the}} initial application of water another 140 mm of water was applied, and on the 7 th day, an 80 mm solution containing complex chemical (NPK) nutrients was also spread over the soil plots. The deep loosening tracks modified the soil's hydraulic properties by decreasing bulk density and increasing soil porosity, water permeability and, implicitly, soil water flux. Solute penetration also showed a preferential character. Under the moist conditions of the heavy-clay soil studied, these tracks were very active soil macropores that had a role similar to that which cracks have on dry soils. Soil water volume and flux as well as drain discharge decreased curve-linearly with time following field saturation over several days of internal drainage. The pipe drainage system combined with deep loosening was an efficient, yet expensive measure in the land reclamation of these heavy-clay soils. When discussing priorities for the hydro improvement measures needed to control soil water, {{it could be said}} that the priority is to prevent excess rainfall in these soils during spring, while secondly it is important to irrigate them during summer time...|$|R

The results from the experiments and the calculations were reasonably consistent. It was found that the untreated clay should not be chosen as the embankment foundation due to its excessive settlements during the stage of operation if the preloading lasted only for 6 months. For the treated clay with wick drains of 1. 5 m spacing, the settlements in the large part of the foundation could be controlled below 30 cm except those near the crest of the embankment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{reclamation}} of salinized soil involves lowering {{ground water}} levels, draining the vadose zone, and leaching the salts from the root zone. <b>Plastic</b> <b>drain</b> tubing placed 1. 5 to 1. 8 m below the land surface can lower watertables and drain phreatic water, but irrigation is usually required to leach the offending salts. The leaching process in non-irrigated drylands depends on natural precipitation. Rows of tall wheatgrass, Thinopyrum ponticum (Podp.) Lui & Wang, (1. 2 m mean height) spaced on 15. 2 -m centers across saline fields can retain blowing snow, augment water for leaching salts, and moderate evapotranspiration when grown {{in conjunction with}} subsurface drainage. The mean salinity of saturated soil paste extracts from sets of soil samples taken every fall from such a site in southwestern Saskatchewan averaged 14. 1 dS m− 1 during 1985 - 90 before the drainage was installed, 13. 0 dS m− 1 for 1991 - 92 after drainage but before the grass windbreaks became established, and 9. 6 dS m− 1 for 1993 - 98 with both drainage and windbreaks in place. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of two methods of subsurface drain installation (corrugated <b>plastic</b> <b>drain</b> pipes installed with a trencher, and a trenchless drain plow) was evaluated using {{five years of}} field data on water table heights and crop yields. Two subsurface drains, each installed with a different method, were monitored from 1980 to 1984 to compare the effect of methods of drain installation on water table heights. Subsurface drains installed with a chain trencher had lower water table heights throughout the crop growing season {{in comparison to the}} water table heights in areas drained by the plow method. Based on these water table measurements, subsurface drains installed with a chain trencher appeared to remove more drainage water from the soil than did subsurface drains installed with a plow. Data collected on corn and soybean yields from the various tillage experiments, drained by two methods of drain installation were compared. Plots drained by trenched drains yielded more than plots drained by plowed drains but differences were not statistically significant at 95 % level...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Discharge {{capacity}} {{is the most}} important factor to evaluate the well resistance of prefabricated vertical (PV) drains. In this study, large-scale test apparatus were devised to investigate the accurate discharge capacity of <b>plastic</b> board <b>drain</b> (PBD) and fiber drain (FD). A series of laboratory flow test of PBD and FD has been carried out to evaluate those discharge capacities with same condition in the field. Drain sample length tested ranging from 0. 7 m to 30 m by confining the drain in clay. It is found that discharge capacity qw of PV drains decreases with increasing the confining pressure, the hydraulic gradient, and drain length. It is strongly recommended that for determining the design value of qw and kw the discharge capacity test should be performed using a half sample length of real field depth. It is found out that well resistance calculated from Onoue’s equation is underestimated comparing to that of Hansbo’s one. 1 INTODUCTION One of the largest changes {{in the last ten years}} of the use of prefabricated vertical (PV) drains and has been the change in terminology and common acceptance of their use as a soft ground improvement tool throughout the world.

40|$|AbstractRecently, the {{disposal}} of dredged soil has become a worldwide problem. In order to utilize high water content soil material, {{it is essential to}} dewater and increase the soil strength. There are urgent demands for developing an alternative new method to dewater the dredged soils in more economical and environment friendly standpoint. Furthermore, by using adsorption effect of porous material such as granular blast furnace slag, there is possibility to establish purification technology of contaminated soil. In this paper, the siphon method is proposed to dewater the high water content dredged soil with horizontally installed <b>plastic</b> board <b>drain</b> and filter material. In order to investigate the availability and effectiveness of this method, series of tests were conducted to investigate the dewatering behaviour and strength of dredged soil with vacuum and siphon methods by using different materials as filter, such as Toyoura sand, zeolite, granular blast furnace slag. High water content dredged soil can be consolidated by using siphon method with saturated filter material such as Toyoura sand. However, it was impossible to dewater dredged soil by using siphon method with unsaturated porous filter material. The water retention tests of soil by using centrifuge method was performed to clarify the mechanism of preventing consolidation dredged soil. The test cannot find an accurate soil-water retention curve of dredged soil because of volume change. The water retention test by suction method was performed and clarify the mechanism that prevents consolidation dredged soil. The cause that prevents consolidation of dredged soil has been presumes by clarifying the air entry value. In addition, degree of saturation and suction in dredged soil and filter material has been clarified by using aquameters. The examination whether consolidation of dredged soil on various conditions focused on height of dredged soil and filter material is performed based on the revealed mechanism...|$|R
