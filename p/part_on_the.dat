5|$|Prior to Witten's announcement, string theorists had {{identified}} five versions of superstring theory. Although these theories appeared, at first, {{to be very}} different, work by several physicists showed that the theories were related in intricate and nontrivial ways. In particular, physicists found that apparently distinct theories could be unified by mathematical transformations called S-duality and T-duality. Witten's conjecture was based in <b>part</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> existence of these dualities and in <b>part</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> relationship of the string theories to a field theory called eleven-dimensional supergravity.|$|E

5|$|With {{industrialisation}} {{and mass}} education, traditional folklore about elves waned, {{but as the}} phenomenon of popular culture emerged, elves were reimagined, in large <b>part</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of Romantic literary depictions and associated medievalism.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} there was a growing {{movement}} to attract native intelligentsia, educated at schools run by the Dutch colonial government, and convince them to view domestic films, which were generally considered to be of much lower quality than imported Hollywood productions. This was blamed, in <b>part,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dominance of theatrically trained actors and crew. As such, Ariffien invited Gani, at the time a medical doctor and a prominent member of the nationalist movement, to join the cast. Although some nationalists considered Gani's involvement in Asmara Moerni as besmirching the independence movement, Gani considered it necessary: he believed audiences needed to have higher opinions of domestic film productions.|$|E
5|$|Curtis {{admitted}} in a 2004 documentary that just before recording began, producer John Lloyd {{came up to}} him with Atkinson and asked what Edmund's character was. Curtis then realised that, despite writing some funny lines, {{he had no idea how}} Rowan Atkinson was supposed to play his <b>part.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> 25th anniversary documentary Blackadder Rides Again, Atkinson added that as the cameras were about to roll for the first time, he suddenly realised he wasn't even sure what voice to use for the character.|$|E

5|$|In concert bands, {{clarinets}} are {{an important}} part of the instrumentation. The E clarinet, B clarinet, alto clarinet, bass clarinet, and contra-alto/contrabass clarinet are commonly used in concert bands. Concert bands generally have multiple B clarinets; there are commonly 3 B clarinet parts with 2–3 players per part. There is generally only one player per <b>part</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other clarinets. There are not always E clarinet, alto clarinet, and contra-alto clarinets/contrabass clarinet parts in concert band music, but all three are quite common.|$|E
5|$|Jonas Mouton was the Big Ten's {{statistical}} {{champion in}} tackles, while Jordan Kovacs finished second. In conference games alone, Roy Roundtree led {{the conference in}} receiving yards per game, in <b>part</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> strength of a school single-game record 246-yard outing against Illinois. Reserve quarterback Tate Forcier also set a school single-game completion percentage record with a 12-for-12 performance against Bowling Green. The defense also set several records, including most points allowed and yards allowed.|$|E

5|$|The Bonn–Paris {{conventions}} {{ended the}} allies occupation of West Germany, and were ratified in <b>part</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis that West Germany join NATO, {{which it did}} in 1955. Though initially isolationist, Spain under Francisco Franco was heavily anti-Communist, and bound by regular defence agreements with NATO countries. After its transition to democracy, Spain came under pressure to normalize its European relations, including joining NATO, which it did in 1982. A referendum in 1986 confirmed popular support for this.|$|E
5|$|The Melbourne Storm has {{a strong}} rivalry with Brisbane, built in large <b>part</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> large number of finals games played between the teams, {{including}} one final in each year from 2004 to 2009; the Storm winning {{all but one of}} them. The move of Brisbane assistant coach Craig Bellamy to Melbourne has also been attributed to fueling the rivalry, as well as the wide spread of Queensland Origin players across their squads in {{the better part of the}} past decade.|$|E
5|$|The {{centre of}} {{attention}} is in large <b>part</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> characters, described {{often with a}} personal slant and using memorable expressions ("It is we who are Hamlet") and incorporating psychological insights that were to become highly influential in later criticism. Though at first less influential, Hazlitt's comments on the plays' dramatic structure and poetry and on the central themes and general mood of each play {{laid the groundwork for}} later critics' more elaborate interpretations. Frequently expressing the view that stage presentation could not do justice to Shakespeare's plays, Hazlitt nevertheless also found certain plays eminently actable, and he frequently admired the performances of certain actors, particularly Edmund Kean.|$|E

Along the jersey, there are two black and white zigzag lines, one in the shoulders, the other near the belly. Between them, the jersey is burgundy, outside those lines it is dark blue. Similar lines exist around the neck. The Avalanche logo is {{in the center of}} the jersey. On top of the shoulders, there is the alternate logo, one on each side. The away jersey is similar but with different colors. The burgundy <b>part</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> home jersey is white on the away jersey, the light blue part is burgundy and the black and white lines became gray and blue.|$|E
5|$|The {{sheer number}} of guns fired {{broadside}} meant a sail battleship could wreck any wooden enemy, holing her hull, knocking down masts, wrecking her rigging, and killing her crew. However, the effective range of the guns was {{as little as a}} few hundred yards, so the battle tactics of sailing ships depended in <b>part</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wind.|$|E

In Bevans, the parties argued over whether a federal court in Massachusetts had jurisdiction over the case of a U.S. Marine charged with a murder that occurred on a ship in Boston Harbor. No issues regarding federal income taxation or the Internal Revenue Code were presented to or decided by the Court in the Bevans case. The Internal Revenue Code and the Internal Revenue Service did not yet exist in 1818, when the Bevans murder case was decided.|$|E
