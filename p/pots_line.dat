50|$|ATMs {{typically}} connect {{directly to}} their host or ATM Controller on either ADSL or dial-up modem over a telephone line or directly on a leased line. Leased lines are preferable to {{plain old telephone service}} (POTS) lines because they require {{less time to}} establish a connection. Less-trafficked machines will usually rely on a dial-up modem on a <b>POTS</b> <b>line</b> rather than using a leased line, since a leased line may be comparatively more expensive to operate compared to a <b>POTS</b> <b>line.</b> That dilemma may be solved as high-speed Internet VPN connections become more ubiquitous. Common lower-level layer communication protocols used by ATMs to communicate back to the bank include SNA over SDLC, TC500 over Async, X.25, and TCP/IP over Ethernet.|$|E

50|$|For example, the Main Distribution Frame (MDF) {{located at}} a {{telephone}} central office terminates the cables leading to subscribers on the one hand, and cables leading to active equipment (such as DSLAMs and telephone switches) on the other. Service is provided to a subscriber by manually wiring a twisted pair (called a jumper wire) between the telephone line and the relevant DSL or <b>POTS</b> <b>line</b> circuit.|$|E
5000|$|In {{terminology}} {{devised by}} phone phreaks, a ringing generator is a magenta box. The device {{can be used}} to simulate an incoming call by applying the AC ringing signal voltage to a <b>POTS</b> <b>line</b> to make the telephones on that line ring. A magenta box in conjunction with an orange box (which emulates the caller ID signal to create falsified data) is called a vermilion box.|$|E
50|$|If {{the call}} {{originates}} on a <b>POTS</b> <b>line</b> (a standard loop start line), then caller ID {{is provided by}} the service provider's local switch. Since the network does not connect the caller to the callee until the phone is answered, generally the caller ID signal cannot be altered by the caller. Most service providers however, allow the caller to block caller ID presentation through the vertical service code *67.|$|E
30|$|Turn {{the entire}} <b>pot</b> <b>line</b> off. A <b>pot</b> can provide AS {{by turning the}} entire pot off, thereby {{reducing}} the electricity consumption by a larger amount.

50|$|Even if all phones {{used the}} same audio codec, packet {{retransmission}} and re-encoding are still required. When a user makes a call to a POTS phone, the audio is digitized into packets that are transmitted from the mobile device and are then decoded into 64 kbit/s PCM. This creates little extra noise, and if the mobile signal strength is sufficient, the user on the <b>POTS</b> <b>line</b> {{will be able to}} carry on a conversation.|$|E
50|$|A DSL filter or {{microfilter}} is {{an analog}} low-pass filter installed between analog devices (such as telephones or analog modems) and a {{plain old telephone service}} (<b>POTS)</b> <b>line.</b> The DSL filter prevents interference between such devices and a {{digital subscriber line}} (DSL) service connected to the same line. Without DSL filters, signals or echoes from analog devices {{at the top of their}} frequency range can reduce performance and create connection problems with DSL service, while those from the DSL service at the bottom of its range can cause line noise and other problems for analog devices.|$|E
50|$|Permanent Signal (PS) in US {{telephony}} jargon, or Permanent Loop in British usage, is {{a condition}} in which a <b>POTS</b> <b>line</b> is off-hook without connection {{for an extended period of}} time. This is indicated in modern switches by the silent termination after the off hook tone times out and the telephone exchange computer puts the telephone line on its High & Wet list or Wetlist. In older switches, however, a Permanent Signal Holding Trunk (PSHT) would play either a howler tone or a 480/500 Hz high tone (which would subsequently bleed into adjacent lines via crosstalk). Howler tone is a tone of increasing intensity that is intended to alert telephone users to the fact that the receiver has been left off the hook without being connected in a call.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We report our {{experience}} in performing telesurgically-mentored procedures from Baltimore, MD to Thailand, Austria, Italy and Singapore. We additionally {{report on a}} case of remote robotic manipulation using a robot designed for Percutaneous Access of the Kidney (PAKY). Telementoring was performed using a video teleconferencing platform including audio, video, real-time video telestration and remote control of the AESOP robotic arm that manipulates the laparoscopic camera. The international telementoring was achieved over 3 - ISDN lines (384 Kilobytes/sec). The robotic arm and PAKY robot were controlled over a separate analog <b>POTS</b> <b>line.</b> Telecommunications links were successfully established to these remote locations that ranged in distance from approximately 4, 500 - 11, 000 miles. There was no perceptible impact of time delay on the surgical procedures. All procedures were successfully completed without additional complications. Multiple laparoscopic surgeries to include varicocelectomy (4), nephrectomy (4), adrenalectomy (1) and cholecystectomies (2) were demonstrated. Remote robotic percutaneous access to the kidney was successfully conducted within fifteen minutes from Baltimore, Maryland to Rome, Italy...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{clinical}} {{application of}} remote telesurgery {{has been the}} use of a novel system of video teleconferencing equipment along with remote control of a laparoscopic camera at distances over 11, 000 miles. Recently, a robotic system has been developed to assist with percutaneous renal surgery. This robot has been incorporated into the telesurgical system to allow remote needle placement into the renal collecting system under radiological guidance. The main component of the telesurgical system is a low degree of freedom robot called "PAKY" (percutaneous access of the kidney). It is custom designed for fluoroscopic guided percutaneous needle insertion into the renal collecting system. The robot is a six-degrees of freedom device. However, when the skin entry site is fixed and held in position, only two degrees of freedom are required to orient the needle in the correct plane for accurate insertion. Remote control of the robot was accomplished over a plain old telephone system (<b>POTS)</b> <b>line.</b> On June 17, 1998, the first remote telerobotic percutaneous renal access procedure was performed between the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland, and Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy. This new telesurgical robot was successful in term of obtaining percutaneous access within 20 min, with two attempts to obtain entry into the collecting system. This robot represents the first system for performing remote telesurgical interventions in the kidney and demonstrates the feasibility and safety of assisting accurate and rapid needle access to the kidney during percutaneous procedures...|$|E

5000|$|Primary {{aluminium}} smelting {{is the process}} of extracting aluminium metal from aluminium oxide (also known as alumina). The process takes place in electrolytic cells that are known as pots. The pots are made up of steel shells with two linings, an outer insulating or refractory lining and an inner carbon lining that acts as the cathode of the electrolytic cell. During the operation of the cell, substances, including aluminium and fluorides, are absorbed into the cell lining. After some years of operation, the <b>pot</b> <b>lining</b> fails and is removed. The removed material is spent potlining (SPL). SPL was listed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1988 as a hazardous waste.Hazardous properties of SPL are: ...|$|R

5|$|By-catch is the {{incidental}} {{capture of}} non-target species in fisheries. Fixed and drift gill nets cause the highest mortality levels for both cetaceans and pinnipeds, however, entanglements in long lines, mid-water trawls, and both trap and <b>pot</b> <b>lines</b> are also common. Tuna seines are particularly problematic for entanglement by dolphins. By-catch affects all cetaceans, both small and big, in all habitat types. However, smaller cetaceans and pinnipeds {{are most vulnerable}} as their size means that escape once they are entangled is highly unlikely and they frequently drown. While larger cetaceans are capable of dragging nets with them, the nets sometimes remain tightly attached to the individual and can impede the animal from feeding sometimes leading to starvation. Abandoned or lost nets and lines cause mortality through ingestion or entanglement. Marine mammals also get entangled in aquaculture nets, however, these are rare events and not prevalent enough to impact populations.|$|R
