50|$|Between {{the stages}} of {{fertilization}} and implantation, the developing human is a preimplantation conceptus. There is some dispute about whether this conceptus should no longer {{be referred to as}} an embryo, but should now be referred to as an proembryo, which is terminology that traditionally has been used to refer to plant life. Some ethicist and legal scholars make the argument that it is incorrect to call the conceptus an embryo, because it will later differentiate into both intraembryonic and extraembryonic tissues, and can even split to produce multiple embryos (identical twins), while others have pointed out that, as so-called extraembryonic tissues are really parts of the embryo's body that are no longer utilized after birth, much as milk teeth fall out after childhood, and as the process of the embryo splitting to form identical twins leaves the original intact, while generating a new embryo, rendering it no different from the process of cloning an adult human.

Of particular concern are exposures during the earliest stages of development that while failing to abrogate embryogenesis, may have long term effects on newborns or adults. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of maternal exposure to the AhR-specific ligand 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo- p -dioxin (TCDD) on the development of rat <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryos</b> with respect to nuclear and cytoskeletal architecture and cell lineage allocation. Results We performed a systematic 3 dimensional (3 D) confocal microscopy analysis of rat <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryos</b> following maternal exposure to environmentally relevant doses of TCDD. Both chronic (50 ng/kg/wk for 3 months) and acute (50 ng/kg and 1 μg/kg at proestrus) maternal TCDD exposure disrupted morphogenesis at the compaction stage (8 – 16 cell), with defects including monopolar spindle formation, f-actin capping and fragmentation due to aberrant cytokinesis. Additionally, the size, shape and position of nuclei were modified in compaction stage <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryos</b> collected from treated animals. Notably, maternal TCDD exposure did not compromise survival to blastocyst, which with the exception of nuclear shape, were morphologically similar to control blastocysts. Conclusion We have identified the compaction stage of pre-implantation embryogenesis as critically sensitive to the effects of TCDD, while survival to the blastocyst stage is not compromised. To the best of our knowledge this is the first in vivo study to demonstrate a critical window of pre-implantation mammalian development that is vulnerable to disruption by an AhR ligand at environmentally relevant doses. </p...|$|R
40|$|Pluripotent blastomeres of {{mammalian}} <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryos</b> and {{embryonic stem}} cells (ESCs) are characterized by limited oxidative capacity and great reliance on anaerobic respiration. Early <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryos</b> and undifferentiated ESCs possess small and immature mitochondria located around the nucleus, have low oxygen consumption and express high levels of glycolytic enzymes. However, as embryonic cells and ESCs lose pluripotency and commit to a specific cell fate, the expression of mtDNA transcription and replication factors is upregulated {{and the number of}} mitochondria and mtDNA copies/cell increases. Moreover, upon cellular differentiation, mitochondria acquire an elongated morphology with swollen cristae and dense matrices, migrate into wider cytoplasmic areas and increase the levels of oxygen consumption and ATP production {{as a result of the}} activation of the more efficient, aerobic metabolism. Since pluripotency seems to be associated with anaerobic metabolism and a poorly developed mitochondrial network and differentiation leads to activation of mitochondrial biogenesis according to the metabolic requirements of the specific cell type, it is hypothesized that reprogramming of somatic cells towards a pluripotent state, by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), transcription-induced pluripotency or creation of pluripotent cell hybrids, requires acquisition of mitochondrial properties characteristic of pluripotent blastomeres and ESCs...|$|R

The dramatic decrease in dehydrogenase activity could not be explained by modulation of the enzyme molecules, because KM values did not vary strongly. It is unlikely that the abundant activity of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase in oocytes is due to high activity of the pentose phosphate pathway because of the low activity of 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, the next step in this pathway.

Supposing the lineage is proved, what is the state of inheritance between them? Lawyers and Islamic jurists have different opinions regarding the lineage of the <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> and inheritance. The author believes that the owner of the sperm is regarded as the genetic father of the child and in terms of lineage between laboratory child and mother two genetic and carrying factors must be considered.

40|$|It is {{recognised}} {{that the}} environment to which the fetus is exposed in utero, after implantation, can program longer term health outcomes and alter the possibility of disease onset later in life. It is becoming evident {{that the environment}}, to which the <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> is exposed, can also affect {{the ability of the}} embryo to form a viable pregnancy as well as altering fetal growth. Despite this understanding, {{little is known about the}} mechanism by which the environment can ‘program’ the <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryo.</b> Using model stress systems, either ammonium or DMO in the culture medium, this thesis addressed the hypothesis that suboptimal environmental conditions may alter mitochondrial homeostasis and function and/or epigenetic parameters and these are the possible mechanisms responsible for the altered fetal outcomes seen. While common measures of embryo quality such as on time blastocyst development were not affected by either stress, more in-depth investigations found several striking differences. Exposure to DMO significantly decreased blastocyst cell number and allocation to the inner cell mass and trophectoderm, as well as increased blastocyst apoptosis. After exposure to DMO, blastocysts were transferred to pseudopregnant recipients, and both the ability of the embryos to implant and develop into a fetus was impaired as well as fetal weights and crown rump length were significantly reduced indicative of altered growth. Similar results have also been demonstrated after pre-implantation embryos are exposed to ammonium in vitro. Exposure to ammonium during <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> development also altered placental gene expression and function, indicating a possible mechanism of the observed reduced fetal growth parameters. Interestingly, the <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> appears to be the most vulnerable to an environmental stress during the pre-compaction stage, in particular the zygote to 2 -cell transition, as exposure to either stress during this stage alone shows similar perturbations to if the stress was present for the entire pre-implantation developmental period. At this early stage of embryo development, mitochondria are the sole energy generators and are therefore critical for embryo function. This study determined that either ammonium or DMO stress exposure, during the first cleavage division, significantly perturbed mitochondrial distribution, membrane potential and ATP/ADP levels. Removal of the stress did not allow these effects to be completely reversed, implicating mitochondrial perturbations as a possible mechanism behind altered embryo programming. During <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> development there are also significant epigenetic changes which are vital for re-programming the embryonic genome. Both in vitro stresses significantly altered DNA de-methylation at the 2 -cell stage and reduced blastocyst gene expression levels of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt 3 a and Dnmt 3 b), which are responsible for de novo methylation. Together these data highlight the importance of <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> development as a critical period of growth in which the presence of environmental stress can have an impact on metabolic homeostasis and critical epigenetic events that may be responsible for the downstream effects seen on fetal growth. These results are not only important for assisted reproductive therapy, where the presence of an in vitro laboratory stress can potentially alter embryo programming, but are also important for in vivo embryo development where the health and wellbeing of the mother can also potentially influence the in utero environment and thus the long-term health outcomes of her child.

40|$|The genetic {{mechanisms}} governing human <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> {{development and}} the in vitro counterparts, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), still remain incomplete. Previous global genome studies demonstrated that totipotent blastomeres from day- 3 human embryos and pluripotent inner cell masses (ICMs) from blastocysts, display unique and differing transcriptomes. Nevertheless, comparative gene expression analysis has revealed that no significant differences exist between hESCs derived from blastomeres versus those obtained from ICMs, suggesting that pluripotent hESCs involve a new developmental progression. To understand early human stages evolution, we developed an undifferentiation network signature (UNS) and applied it to a differential gene expression profile between single blastomeres from day- 3 embryos, ICMs and hESCs. This allowed us to establish a unique signature composed of highly interconnected genes characteristic of totipotency (61 genes), in vivo pluripotency (20 genes), and in vitro pluripotency (107 genes), and which are also proprietary according to functional analysis.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the consequences of}} removing embryos from the incubator daily, and exposing them to ambient air at 37. 0  °C for short periods of time, on embryo development, gene expression {{and the health of}} the conceptus. Methods: An in vitro cross-sectional study was undertaken using CBA F 1 mouse zygotes exposed to ambient air at 37. 0  °C for 3, 5, and 8  min daily during their entire in vitro development. Blastocysts were analyzed for total cell numbers, apoptosis, and H 19 and Igf 2 expression and transferred to pseudopregnant recipient females to examine pregnancy, fetal and placental weight, and placental H 19 and Igf 2 expression. Results: Short exposure of <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryos</b> to ambient air at 37. 0  °C resulted in a statistically significant reduction in blastocyst development and total cell numbers, increased apoptotic cell index, and impaired H 19 and Igf 2 expression in the blastocyst.

Transcripts of these genes are detected only in eggs and in <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryos.</b> Both genes are intronless except for a solitary intron in the 5 ′-untranslated region. Here, we showed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and reverse transcription experiments that Rnf 35 transcription uses a single promoter and a terminating site. On the other hand, Rnf 33 is transcribed using multiple promoters. At the four-cell stage, however, Rnf 33 mRNA with a single transcription start site derived from the proximal promoter is detected, indicating {{that it is the}} major promoter. Sequences upstream of the Rnf 35 and the major Rnf 33 transcription start sites carry no TATA boxes but a putative transcription initiator (Inr) element is discernible in each case.

In this study, the acute and longer term effects of seminal plasma on cytokine expression and leukocyte abundance in the pig endometrium during early pregnancy have been characterised. The reproductive tracts of gonadotrophin-primed pre-pubertal gilts treated with intrauterine infusions of either pooled seminal plasma or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were retrieved at 34 h, or on day 5 and day 9 after treatment. Seminal plasma elicited an endometrial inflammatory infiltrate comprised of predominantly macrophages and major histocompatibility complex class II+-activated macrophages and dendritic cells. The abundance of these cells was greatest at the pre-ovulatory (34 h) time-point and their increase relative to PBS-treated tissues was maintained until day 9 after seminal plasma treatment. Seminal plasma induced {{the expression of the}} cytokines, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin- 6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1, and the eicosanoid-synthesising enzyme cyclo-oxygenase- 2. Expression was maximal 34 h after treatment but altered expression patterns as a consequence of seminal plasma induction persisted through early pregnancy. These changes were accompanied by altered dynamics in <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> development with {{an increase in the number}} of embryos and in their viability after seminal plasma treatment. Together, these findings implicate factors in seminal plasma in programming the trajectory of uterine cytokine expression and leukocyte trafficking during early pregnancy and in regulating <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> development in the pigS O'Leary, M J Jasper, G M Warnes, D T Armstrong and S A Robertso...|$|E
40|$|Kruppel-like {{transcription}} factors (Klfs) {{are essential}} for the induction and maintenance of pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), yet {{little is known about}} their roles in establishing the three lineages of the <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryo.</b> Here, we show that Klf 5 is required for the formation of the trophectoderm (TE) and the inner cell mass (ICM), and for repressing primitive endoderm (PE) development. Although cell polarity appeared normal, Klf 5 mutant embryos arrested at the blastocyst stage and failed to hatch due to defective TE development. Klf 5 acted cell-autonomously in the TE, downstream of Fgf 4 and upstream of Cdx 2, Eomes and Krt 8. In the ICM, loss of Klf 5 resulted in reduced expression of pluripotency markers Oct 4 and Nanog, but led to increased Sox 17 expression in the PE, suggesting that Klf 5 suppresses the PE lineage. Consistent with this, overexpression of Klf 5 in transgenic embryos was sufficient to suppress the Sox 17 + PE lineage in the ICM. Klf 5 overexpression led to a dose-dependent decrease in Sox 17 promoter activity in reporter assays in cultured cells. Moreover, in chimeric embryos, Klf 5 –/– cells preferentially contributed to the Sox 17 + PE lineage and Cdx 2 expression was not rescued in Klf 5 –/– outer cells. Finally, outgrowths from Klf 5 –/– embryos failed to form an ICM/pluripotent colony, had very few Oct 4 + or Cdx 2 + cells, but showed an increase in the percentage of Sox 17 + PE cells. These findings demonstrate that Klf 5 is a dynamic regulator of all three lineages in the <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> by promoting the TE and epiblast lineages while suppressing the PE lineage...|$|E

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) {{is one of}} an array of cytokines with pivotal roles in embryo implantation and subsequent development. Several cell lineages in the reproductive tract and gestational tissues synthesise GM-CSF under direction by ovarian steroid hormones and signalling agents originating in male seminal fluid and the conceptus. The <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryo,</b> invading placental trophoblast cells and the abundant populations of leukocytes controlling maternal immune tolerance are all subject to GM-CSF regulation.

40|$|SNARE-mediated {{membrane}} fusion is {{a pivotal}} event for a wide-variety of biological processes. SNAP- 25, a neuron-specific SNARE protein, has been well-characterized and mouse embryos lacking Snap 25 are viable. However, the phenotype of mice lacking SNAP- 23, the ubiquitously expressed SNAP- 25 homolog, remains unknown. To reveal {{the importance of}} SNAP- 23 function in mouse development, we generated Snap 23 -null mice by homologous recombination. We were unable to obtain newborn SNAP- 23 -deficient mice, and analysis of <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryos</b> from Snap 23 (Δ/wt) matings revealed that Snap 23 -null blastocysts were dying prior to implantation at embryonic day E 3. 5.

40|$|Millions {{of couples}} {{worldwide}} have difficulties in conceiving a child. These couples, affected by infertility, suffer from symptoms of stress. The causes of infertility are largely unknown and current available treatment, {{in vitro fertilization}} has moderate success rates. The in vitro fertilization covers pre-implantation stage of the human embryo development. Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms in the early development might help to improve the in vitro fertilization methods. Much of the knowledge on early development has been gained from model organisms: nematode, fruit fly, zebrafish and mouse. Mouse is a commonly used model organism for mammalian pre-implantation development. Global gene expression studies have been performed on mouse and human. Overall, gene expression changes seem to be similar in principle between the organisms. However, {{the expression of the}} first transcribed genes in the early development may not be as conserved between species as other genes expressed later in development. Therefore, human pre-implantation development should also be studied on human material for better translation of the results. Genes with a dynamic expression profile in human pre-implantation development were identified in Paper I. Various criteria such as conservation, expression profile in mouse, relevance in cancer and novelty were applied to choose seventy genes of potential importance in human early development. Expression of those genes was studied in mouse and compared with human orthologues. The results showed differences in the expression profiles between human and mouse. Paper II found novel regulatory elements and potentially important transcription factors from human early development by single-cell RNA sequencing. About 350 of oocytes and blastomeres from early embryos were studied, the promoters of activated genes were analyzed, and many PRD-like homeodomain genes with first-time evidence of expression were cloned. These genes were suggested to regulate the early development. Paper III describes the expression pattern, target genes and potential function in early development for the PRD-like homeodomain gene LEUTX. A novel variant of LEUTX was identified and cloned, providing a full homeodomain-containing and functional isoform of the protein. LEUTX was found expressed exclusively in human <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryos.</b> The target genes of LEUTX were enriched among the genes activated by human embryo, which strongly indicated regulatory function for LEUTX in the early development. The other PRD-like homeodomain containing proteins were studied in Paper IV. Expression of those genes was found to be specific for early development. The targets of CPHX 1 and DPRX were found to be enriched among the genes activated in the early human embryo. General overlap of the target genes allowed for discussion of their possible functional redundancy. The thesis offers novel findings for understanding gene expression and regulation in human <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryos.</b> The studies identify novel PRD-like homeodomain containing transcription factors that may have a crucial importance in the regulation of gene expression in the human <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryos...</b>|$|R
40|$|ES (embryonic stem) {{cell lines}} {{are derived from}} the epiblast of <b>pre-implantation</b> <b>embryos</b> and like the inner cell mass cells from which they are derived exhibit the {{remarkable}} property of pluripotency, namely the ability to differentiate into all cell lineages comprising the adult organism. ES cells and their differentiated progeny offer tremendous potential to regenerative medicine, particularly as cellular therapies {{for the treatment of}} a wide variety of chronic disorders, such as Type 1 diabetes, Parkinson's disease and retinal degeneration. In order for this potential to be realized, a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating the fundamental properties of ES cells, i. e. pluripotency, proliferation and differentiation, is required. In the present paper, we review the evidence that PI 3 K (phosphoinositide 3 -kinase) -dependent signalling plays a role in regulation of both ES cell pluripotency and proliferation...|$|R
