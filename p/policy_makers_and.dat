40|$|This paper {{investigated}} two {{roles of}} public reviews in disaster risk management: 1) providing {{information to a}} <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> about the desirability of a disaster risk management plan and 2) promoting stakeholders' trust in <b>policy</b> <b>maker's</b> decision. Our analysis was conducted by formulating two linked communication games, which described, respectively, information transmission from public reviewers to a <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> <b>and</b> trust formation between the <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> <b>and</b> an individual. It was shown that there exists an externality between the two games, <b>and</b> the <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> accordingly faces a trade-off between the two roles of public reviews. Due to this trade-off, trust formation between the <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> <b>and</b> the individual might be prevented. Finally, alternative institutional design for realizing trust formation between the <b>policy</b> <b>maker</b> <b>and</b> the individual through public reviews was discussed. It was pointed out that a communication protocol that disciplines {{the way in which}} reviewers express their opinions has to be designed in order to realize the two roles of public reviews...|$|R

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the changed approach within the emerging economies, US <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> <b>and</b> economists remained relatively unconcerned about BOP imbalances. In the early to mid-1990s, many free market economists and policy makers such as U.S. Treasury secretary Paul O'Neill and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan went on record suggesting the growing US deficit was not a major concern. While several emerging economies had intervening to boost their reserves and assist their exporters from the late 1980s, they only began running a net current account surplus after 1999. This was mirrored in the faster growth for the US current account deficit from the same year, with surpluses, deficits and the associated buildup of reserves by the surplus countries reaching record levels by the early 2000s and growing year by year. Some economists such as Kenneth Rogoff and Maurice Obstfeld began warning that the record imbalances would soon {{need to be addressed}} from as early as 2001, joined by Nouriel Roubini in 2004, {{but it was not until}} about 2007 that their concerns began to be accepted by the majority of economists.|$|E
25|$|The Times {{was founded}} by {{publisher}} John Walter on 1 January 1785 as The Daily Universal Register, with Walter {{in the role of}} editor. Walter had lost his job by the end of 1784 after the insurance company where he was working went bankrupt because of the complaints of a Jamaican hurricane. Being unemployed, Walter decided to set a new business up. It was in that time when Henry Johnson invented the logography, a new typography that was faster and more precise (three years later, it was proved that it was not as efficient as had been said). Walter bought the logography's patent and to use it, he decided to open a printing house, where he would daily produce an advertising sheet. The first publication of the newspaper The Daily Universal Register in Great Britain was 1 January 1785. Unhappy because people always omitted the word Universal, Ellias changed the title after 940 editions on 1 January 1788 to The Times. In 1803, Walter handed ownership and editorship to his son of the same name. Walter Sr had spent sixteen months in Newgate Prison for libel printed in The Times, but his pioneering efforts to obtain Continental news, especially from France, helped build the paper's reputation among <b>policy</b> <b>makers</b> <b>and</b> financiers.|$|E

The source of the problem is the force of public opinion, a force that is inevitably unstable, unserious, subjective, emotional, and simplistic.
