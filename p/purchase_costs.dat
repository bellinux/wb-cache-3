These houses, which were actual houses that were allowed to be demolished by the original owners, were recreated by a team of architecture students, carpenters and workers. The original houses in their [...] "vernacular style" [...] were purchased by MCF and <b>purchase</b> <b>costs</b> varied from Rs. 50,000 for ordinary mud houses to Rs. 1.5 million for the Chettinad merchants' mansions with crafted doors and woodwork.) They were then dismantled systematically under the guidance of stapathis (temple architects). The dismantled elements were transported to the museum site and recreated at the allotted space in their exact original form. Apart from recreating the homes, the roads and all other features that existed in the old village sites were recreated. Some critics have complained that the characterization of pre-industrial village life is inaccurate, focusing too much on the Nattukkottai Chettiar, and that the site is [...] "stamped" [...] with [...] "American consumerism".|$|E
