He first used the term [...] "Noa Noa" [...] to describe the scent of Tahitian women: [...] "A mingled perfume, half animal, half vegetable emanated from them; the <b>perfume</b> <b>of</b> their blood and of the gardenia taitensis, which they wore in their hair". On his return to Paris in 1893, Gauguin was apprehensive about exhibiting his Tahitian works. Noa Noa was to provide the context necessary {{for the public to}} comprehend the new motifs presented at his Durand-Ruel exhibition. It was not, however, completed in time for the opening of the exhibition.|$|E

2500|$|At the Basilica of Saint Nicholas in Bari, Italy, {{there is}} an annual {{ceremony}} of collecting a clear liquid from the tomb of Saint Nicholas; legend credits the pleasant <b>perfume</b> <b>of</b> this liquid with warding off evil, and it is sold to pilgrims as [...] "the Manna of Saint Nicholas". The liquid gradually seeps out of the tomb, but {{it is unclear whether}} it originates from the body within the tomb, or from the marble itself; since the town of Bari is a harbor, and the tomb is below sea level, there are several natural explanations for the manna fluid, including the transfer of seawater to the tomb by capillary action.|$|E

Photography would be sufficient'. Nayral answers the query: 'a thinking human {{in harmony with the}} surroundings, in accordance with them', one must 'reveal the concert of all these forms of life that are the thought of this man, the <b>perfume</b> <b>of</b> this flower, the brilliance of this plant, the vibration of this light, this is the task of the artist'. In essence, write Antliff and Leighten in Cubism and Culture, [...] "this synthetic vision was the product of Gleizes's sympathetic response to the expressive acts and physiognomic traits he deemed indicative of the poet's character. Both form and content in the work were the result of Gleizes's mental associations while working from memory.|$|E
2500|$|Before August 1899, Florescu's {{work was}} {{hampered}} by an illness, later diagnosed as ventricular hypertrophy; {{he was living}} {{with his family in}} a small house on Speranței Street, north of Colțea Hospital. Luxița Florescu died in October of that year, aged 83, and Bonifaciu only two months later, on December 18. Demetriade unexpectedly dropped by on a visit just after his friend's death, recalling: [...] "he had woken up more joyful than ever. Always one to enjoy a pun, he asked his wife, whose name was Rose, to hand him a rose that had been left in some glass. Just after Madam Florescu handed him that flower, the soul of this man, always a poet, went out with the <b>perfume</b> <b>of</b> the rose." [...] A brief obituary in Literatorul credited him as someone [...] "illustrious but unhappy", who [...] "stood up to the intellectual degeneracy into which our country was continuously pushed." [...] He was buried in the family crypt at Țigănești Monastery, next to his mother, with a funeral ceremony attended by the Bucharest aristocracy and the Saint Sava students. The grave has since been lost during extensive repair work on the monastery grounds.|$|E

[...] Kenneth Turan, in his review for Los Angeles Times, wrote, [...] "The only potential audience drawback L.A. Confidential has is its reliance on unsettling bursts of violence, both bloody shootings and intense physical beatings that give the picture a palpable air of menace. Overriding that, finally, is the film's complete command of its material." [...] In his review for The Independent, Ryan Gilbey wrote, [...] "In fact, it's a very well made and intelligent picture, assembled with an attention to detail, both in plot and characterisation, that you might have feared was all but extinct in mainstream American cinema." [...] Richard Williams, in his review for The Guardian, wrote, [...] "L.A. Confidential gets just about everything right. The light, the architecture, the slang, the music ... a wonderful Lana Turner joke. A sense, above all, of damaged people arriving to make new lives and getting seduced by the scent of night-blooming jasmine, the <b>perfume</b> <b>of</b> corruption." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{headline}} in a September 1895 article by The New York Times ran [...] "Armenian Holocaust," [...] while the Catholic World declared, [...] "Not all the <b>perfume</b> <b>of</b> Arabia can wash {{the hand of}} Turkey clean enough to be suffered any longer to hold the reins of power over one inch of Christian territory." [...] The rest of the American press called for action to help the Armenians and to remove, [...] "if not by political action than by resort to the knife... the fever spot of the Turkish Empire." [...] King Leopold II of Belgium told British Prime Minister Salisbury that {{he was prepared to}} send his Congolese Force Publique to [...] "invade and occupy" [...] Armenia. The massacres were an important item on the agenda of the United States President Grover Cleveland, and in his presidential platform for 1896, Republican candidate William McKinley listed the saving of the Armenians as one of his top priorities in foreign policy. Americans in the Ottoman Empire, such as George Washburn, then-president of the Constantinople-based Robert College, pressured their government to take concrete action. In December 1900, the USS Kentucky called at the port of Smyrna, where its captain, [...] "Red Bill" [...] Kirkland, delivered the following warning, somewhat softened by his translator, to its governor: [...] "If these massacres continue I'll be swuzzled if I won't someday forget my order… and find some pretext to hammer a few Turkish towns… [...] I'd keel-haul every blithering mother's son of a Turk that wears hair." [...] Americans on the mainland, such as Julia Ward Howe, David Josiah Brewer, and John D. Rockefeller, donated and raised large amounts of money and organized relief aid that was channeled to the Armenians via the newly established American Red Cross. Other humanitarian groups and the Red Cross helped by sending aid to the remaining survivors who were dying of disease and hunger.|$|E
