25|$|In October 2009, Democratic {{political}} operatives used YouTube {{videos of}} WWE for <b>political</b> <b>ads.</b> On October 16, Colleen Flanagan, {{a spokeswoman for}} Chris Dodd, posted controversial videos that showed the unsavory side of WWE on Talking Points Memo, a political news website. She said the programming showed “simulated rape, public sex and necrophilia” and McMahon should not be Senator because she “condones this type of behavior”. Hours later, YouTube removed the videos after contact from WWE. WWE had informed YouTube that the material was copyright under US law.|$|E
500|$|During the September 28, 2011 {{episode of}} The Colbert Report, Colbert {{consulted}} his lawyer and {{they set up}} his own 501(c)(4) organization, similar to American Crossroads. [...] As a super PAC the organization can raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions and other groups, as well as wealthy individuals. [...] With Colbert {{as president of the}} Colbert Super PAC, the PAC ran several <b>political</b> <b>ads</b> prior to the Ames Straw Poll. The first ad, titled [...] "Episode IV: A New Hope", told Iowans to write-in [...] "Rick Parry" [...] instead of Rick Perry, [...] and the second ad, [...] "Behind the Green Corn", supported [...] "Parry" [...] as well.|$|E
500|$|On August 2, 2016, {{the court}} denied {{a request by}} The Washington Post and other media {{organizations}} for the public release of hours of videotaped testimony from Trump's two depositions in Cohen, taken in November 2015 and January 2016. Transcripts of those depositions had already been released, showing [...] "that Trump repeatedly indicated {{that he had never}} met instructors at Trump University, despite advertisements for the program indicating that its staff had been handpicked by the real estate mogul." [...] Trump's attorneys had opposed the requests to release the videotapes. Curiel ruled that there was a legitimate public interest in the content of the deposition, but that interest was satisfied via public release of the transcripts. The judge also noted that if the videos were publicly released, it was [...] "nigh-inevitable" [...] that the footage would be used in news accounts and <b>political</b> <b>ads,</b> which might prejudice the jury pool pre-trial.|$|E

[...] All content was later removed, although the site is still owned.|$|E
2500|$|On October 12, Duterte {{declared}} {{his intention to}} terminate joint US–Philippine naval patrols in the South China Sea, which he believes could needlessly antagonize China. His reticent approach with China contrasts with his otherwise [...] "belligerent rhetoric and swaggering persona"; he has received support for some <b>political</b> <b>ads</b> from an anonymous Chinese donor.|$|E

2500|$|Politically, Iacocca {{supported}} the Republican candidate George W. Bush in the 2000 presidential election. In the 2004 presidential election, however, he endorsed Bush's opponent, Democrat John Kerry. In Michigan's 2006 gubernatorial race, Iacocca appeared in televised <b>political</b> <b>ads</b> endorsing Republican candidate Dick DeVos, who lost. Iacocca endorsed New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson for President in the 2008 presidential election. [...] In 2012, he endorsed Mitt Romney for President.|$|E
2500|$|For a time, Charney used a {{branding}} strategy that spotlighted {{his treatment of}} workers, promoting American Apparel's goods as [...] "sweatshop free."

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the third season, Sue's {{campaign}} for Congress is not going well. She decides to pledge {{to get rid of all}} arts programs in schools, music and theater especially, until all students are reading at or above grade level. Will's attempt to embarrass Sue and highlight the value of the arts by glitter bombing her backfires, and Sue's poll numbers rise. She also goes back on her promise to leave the glee club alone by having her new cheerleading co-captains, Becky and Santana, sabotage the club's recruitment drive. She rails against the school musical, and succeeds in having its funding rescinded. This angers Kurt's father, Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), who arranges for local businesses to sponsor the musical, and he enters the congressional race as a write-in candidate to defeat her. Sue runs a negative campaign, airing <b>political</b> <b>ads</b> containing false statements about Burt's personal life through her <b>political</b> <b>ads.</b> One of the other candidates in the race discovers that Santana is a lesbian, and uses this to attack Sue on the issue of [...] "family values" [...] for appointing her a cheerleading captain, and to imply that Sue herself is a lesbian. Santana is devastated, as she has not yet come out as a lesbian. Sue attempts to combat the implications by starting a relationship one of her former bed partners, Ohio State football recruiter Cooter Menkins, who had recently been dating Coach Beiste. Being seen in public with Cooter does not help her in the voting, however; she comes in third, and Burt wins.|$|E

2500|$|The {{scheduled}} date for Super Bowl XLII was {{two days before}} Super Tuesday (Tuesday, February 5), the date in which 24 states held their presidential primaries, state conventions or caucuses. As such, some presidential hopefuls had considered purchasing Super Bowl ads. An adviser to Republican presidential candidate John McCain said that the football audience is [...] "a very ripe and timely target." [...] However, Fox Television nixed the prospect of any <b>political</b> <b>ads,</b> citing equal time regulations {{and the fact that}} the ad space had already sold out before any candidates had asked for it. Instead, candidates purchased advertising time before or after the game or in two dozen local markets. For this game Fox pulled in $250 million in revenue from the ads.|$|E
2500|$|Brown's {{fundraising}} {{strength is}} diminished by the hesitance of large donors to leave themselves {{vulnerable to the}} legal difficulties encountered by donors to [...] "swiftboat" [...] ad efforts in the 2004 election cycle, and to new laws which curtail {{some of the more}} offensive content of <b>political</b> <b>ads</b> by 527 groups. As some of the contributors to the [...] "swiftboat" [...] ads in 2004 faced stiff fines from the FEC, Brown has refrained from operating out of 527 groups and opted for the PAC platform and budgeting from small donors. Brown's stated goal is to release one new attack ad every two weeks, and released an advertisement asserting that Obama was registered as a Muslim student in Indonesia, and that he attended an Indonesian school that taught Islam as a child. The claim has been refuted by the Obama campaign.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, a {{political}} unknown named Lyndon LaRouche entered the New Hampshire Democratic Primary and polled 2% of the vote, coming in fourth place. He and his National Democratic Policy Committee were largely ignored until 1984, {{when he became}} something of a curiosity by paying for half-hour <b>political</b> <b>ads</b> proclaiming Walter Mondale a Soviet agent of influence, and 1986, when two followers of his won upset victories in Democratic primaries for statewide races in Illinois. After the media began to pay attention, LaRouche was promptly labeled an ultraconservative Democrat by some, and a nut by others, primarily due to the overlap {{of some of his}} views with those of the Reagan administration. Others disputed the label and noted LaRouche's background as a Marxist/Trotskyist from the 1940s until the early 1970s. Among those to criticize LaRouche as a [...] "leftist" [...] was conservative Democratic Congressman and John Birch Society leader Larry McDonald, who was killed when the passenger aircraft he was travelling in was shot down by Soviet interceptors.|$|E

50|$|A {{few days}} after the playoff match against Club Universidad in 2009, Sóla {{appeared}} in a <b>political</b> <b>ad</b> by the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (P.R.I.), the political party of Puebla's governor at the time Mario Marín. This resulted in criticism from some Mexican sports commentators and others who disagreed with sports figures getting involved in political campaigns.|$|R
2500|$|On November 6, 2007, Pickens {{offered a}} million dollars to anyone able to dispute any claims made in <b>political</b> <b>ads</b> by the Swift Vets and POWs for Truth (SVPT), a group he had {{supported}} during the 2004 presidential election. John Kerry, whose military record and anti-war activism during Vietnam was the target of the group's book and media campaign, sent Pickens a letter on November16, 2007, accepting the challenge, requesting that Pickens donate the money to the Paralyzed Veterans of America should he succeed in disproving any of the SVPT claims. In response to Kerry's acceptance of the challenge, Pickens issued a letter the same day, narrowing the original challenge to the SVPT ads, and requiring Kerry to provide his Vietnam journal, all of his military records, specifically those covering the years after his active duty service, and copies of all movies and tapes made during his service. Pickens' letter also challenged Kerry to agree to donate $1 million to the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation, if Kerry [...] "cannot prove anything in the Swift Boat ads to be untrue." [...] Kerry later accused Pickens of [...] "parsing and backtracking" [...] on his initial offer and wrote that [...] "I am prepared to prove the lie and marshal all the evidence, the question is whether you are prepared to fulfill your obligation." ...|$|E
