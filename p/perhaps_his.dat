5|$|Lynch's oeuvre {{encompasses}} work in both cinema and television. His films include The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, The Straight Story, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>his</b> most critically successful film, 2001's Mulholland Drive; whilst {{his television}} debut, Twin Peaks, earned five Emmy Award nominations {{for its first}} season.|$|E
5|$|While all of {{the contradictions}} above cannot be reconciled, the most {{probable}} dates that may be drawn from available data place Æthelberht's birth at approximately 560 and, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>his</b> marriage to Bertha at 580. His reign {{is most likely to}} have begun in 589 or 590.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Allingham {{was in a}} {{reserved}} {{occupation and}} worked {{on a number of}} projects. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>his</b> most significant contribution was the design of an effective counter-measure to the German magnetic mines. During his Christmas lunch in 1939 he was called away to help design a system that would neutralise the mines and open the port of Harwich, Essex. Nine days later, he had successfully completed the task.|$|E

5|$|King Nechtan son of Der-Ile abdicated {{to enter}} a monastery in 724 and was imprisoned by his {{successor}} Drest in 726. In 728 and 729, four kings competed for power in Pictland: Drest; Nechtan; Alpín, of whom little is known; and lastly Óengus, who was a partisan of Nechtan, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>his</b> acknowledged heir.|$|E
5|$|Denard Robinson had <b>perhaps</b> <b>his</b> worst game up to {{this point}} in the season: he threw three interceptions and was held to only 84 yards rushing. This marked the first time that Michigan State had {{defeated}} Michigan {{three years in a row}} since they accomplished this feat from 1965–1967. The announced crowd of 113,065 was, at the time, the second largest crowd ever at Michigan Stadium. As a testament to Michigan's ongoing kicking woes, the field goal in the first half was Michigan's first attempt since the game against UMass and the first converted kick since the game against Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} afterwards, his main {{literary}} output was his voluminous correspondence with his disciples. His letters, {{most of which}} were written in the 1930s, numbered in the several thousands. Many were brief comments made in the margins of his disciple's notebooks in answer to their questions and reports of their spiritual practice—others extended to several pages of carefully composed explanations of practical aspects of his teachings. These were later collected and published in book form in three volumes of Letters on Yoga. In the late 1930s, he resumed work on a poem he had started earlier—he continued to expand and revise this poem {{for the rest of his}} life. It became <b>perhaps</b> <b>his</b> greatest literary achievement, Savitri, an epic spiritual poem in blank verse of approximately 24,000 lines.|$|E
50|$|<b>Perhaps</b> {{because of}} <b>his</b> later {{service for the}} BSAC, or <b>perhaps</b> because <b>his</b> role was {{considered}} subordinate, Dr Moloney's reputation {{does not seem to}} have been subject to the same hostility that the British in Northern Rhodesia later directed towards the reputation of Captain Stairs for winning Katanga for the Belgians.|$|R

5|$|Romney {{stood to}} benefit from the Republican electorate's {{tendency}} to nominate candidates who had previously run for president, and thus appeared to be next in line to be chosen. The early stages of the race found him as the apparent front-runner in a weak field, especially in terms of fundraising prowess and organization. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>his</b> greatest hurdle in gaining the Republican nomination was party opposition to the Massachusetts health care reform law that he had shepherded five years earlier. As many potential Republican candidates with star power and fundraising ability decided not to run (including Mike Pence, John Thune, Haley Barbour, Mike Huckabee, and Mitch Daniels), Republican party figures searched for plausible alternatives to Romney.|$|E
5|$|The Boston College ground {{offense was}} led by running back Andre Callender, who had <b>perhaps</b> <b>his</b> biggest {{game of the year}} during the division-clinching match against Clemson two weeks earlier. In that game, Callender {{finished}} with 92receivingyards and 75rushingyards. Due to the success of Matt Ryan's passing attack, however, Callender was used mostly as a backfield receiver and was the team's leading receiver statistically during the 2007season. In the regular season, Callender amassed 905yards rushing, 613yards receiving, and 13total touchdowns. Callender's normal backup, running back A.J. Brooks, was suspended for the ACC Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} manuscript {{of the score}} does not exist; two surviving copies from the 1650s show significant differences from each other, and each differs to some extent from the libretto. How much of the music is actually Monteverdi's, and how much the product of others, {{is a matter of}} dispute. None of the existing versions of the libretto, printed or manuscript, can be definitively tied to the first performance at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo, the precise date of which is unknown. Details of the original cast are few and largely speculative, and there is no record of the opera's initial public reception. Despite these uncertainties, the work is generally accepted as part of the Monteverdi operatic canon, his last and <b>perhaps</b> <b>his</b> greatest work.|$|E

5|$|This {{may have}} been {{for any number of}} reasons. Since paper was very expensive, Ramanujan would do most of his work and <b>perhaps</b> <b>his</b> proofs on slate, and then {{transfer}} just the results to paper. Using a slate was common for mathematics students in the Madras Presidency at the time. He was also quite likely to have been influenced by the style of G. S. Carr's book, which stated results without proofs. Finally, it is possible that Ramanujan considered his workings to be for his personal interest alone and therefore recorded only the results.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1790s, Grimaldi {{starred in}} a {{pantomime}} version of Robinson Crusoe, which confirmed his credentials as a key pantomime performer. Many productions followed, but his career at Drury Lane was becoming turbulent, and he left the theatre in 1806. In his new association with the Covent Garden theatre, he appeared at {{the end of the}} same year in Thomas John Dibdin's Harlequin and Mother Goose; or, The Golden Egg, which included <b>perhaps</b> <b>his</b> best known portrayal of Clown. Grimaldi's residencies at Covent Garden and Sadler's Wells ran simultaneously, and he became known as London's leading Clown and comic entertainer, enjoying many successes at both theatres. His popularity in London led to a demand for him to appear in provincial theatres throughout England, where he commanded large fees.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{was lucky}} to escape from a crash in the Masaryk Grand Prix. He and Chiron were chasing Fagioli when Fagioli crashed into a wooden footbridge, {{bringing}} it crashing down onto the road. Caracciola and Chiron drove into a ditch {{at the side of}} the road to avoid the debris; while Chiron drove out of the ditch and was able to continue, Caracciola drove into a tree and retired. Despite this accident, Caracciola again performed strongly in the Hillclimbing Championship; he won eight climbs in his SSKL to take the title. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>his</b> most significant achievement of 1931 was his win in the Mille Miglia. The local fleet of Alfa Romeos battled for the lead early in the race, but when they fell back Caracciola was able to take control. His win, in record time, made him and his co-driver Wilhelm Sebastian (who allowed Caracciola to drive the entire race) the first foreigners to win the Italian race. The only other foreigners to win the race on the full course were Stirling Moss and Denis Jenkinson in 1955.|$|E

5|$|In 1928, Fairley {{received}} an appointment in London as Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and Lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Although he and Kellaway convinced the governors to delay Fairley's commencement until their major venom work was completed, he departed for London {{by the end}} of that year. He also opened a consulting practice in Harley Street. In London he encountered patients with filariasis and devised a test to diagnose the disease at an early stage; but when he went to write up his results he discovered that details of a similar test had already been published. In 1934, a sewer worker was referred to his ward with acute jaundice which Fairley diagnosed as caused by filariasis. The disease was revealed to be an occupational hazard of sewer workers, and steps were taken to protect the workers. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>his</b> most important work in this period was research into blackwater fever. Since malaria cases were uncommon in the United Kingdom, he made annual visits to the Malaria Research Laboratory of the League of Nations at the Refugee Hospital in Salonika. In the process, he described methaemalbumin, a previously unknown blood pigment. For his scientific accomplishments in London, Fairley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1942.|$|E
5|$|In October 37 AD, Caligula fell seriously ill, {{or perhaps}} was poisoned. He soon {{recovered}} from his illness, but many {{believed that the}} illness turned the young emperor toward the diabolical: he started to kill off or exile those who were close to him or whom he saw as a serious threat. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>his</b> illness {{reminded him of his}} mortality and of the desire of others to advance into his place. He had his cousin and adopted son Tiberius Gemellus executed – an act that outraged Caligula's and Gemellus's mutual grandmother Antonia Minor. She is said to have committed suicide, although Suetonius hints that Caligula actually poisoned her. He had his father-in-law Marcus Junius Silanus and his brother-in-law Marcus Lepidus executed as well. His uncle Claudius was spared only because Caligula preferred to keep him as a laughing stock. His favourite sister Julia Drusilla died in 38 AD of a fever: his other two sisters, Livilla and Agrippina the Younger, were exiled. He hated being the grandson of Agrippa and slandered Augustus by repeating a falsehood that his mother was actually conceived as the result of an incestuous relationship between Augustus and his daughter Julia the Elder.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his duties as a professional herald, Brooke-Little held three administrative positions at the College of Arms. From 1974 until 1982, he served as Registrar, with responsibility to enter all new grants and confirmations of arms into the College records. Brooke-Little's signature {{can be found on}} the reverse of the letters patent for every grant made during this period. In addition, he served as the College's librarian from 1974 until 1994 and the treasurer of the College of Arms from 1978 until 1995. He was also the director of the Heralds' Museum at the Tower of London from 1991 to 1997; this museum is no longer operating. Although Brooke-Little enjoyed prominence as a professional officer of arms and as an author on heraldic subjects, his role in founding the Heraldry Society, and in guiding the society and editing its journal for many years, was <b>perhaps</b> <b>his</b> greatest contribution to the science of heraldry.|$|E

5|$|On 30 July 1996, {{for a world}} {{transfer}} record-breaking £15 million (equivalent to £ million today) Shearer {{joined his}} hometown club and league runners-up Newcastle United, managed by his hero Keegan. Shearer made his league debut away at Everton, on 17 August 1996, and maintained his form {{during the rest of}} the season, finishing as Premier League top-scorer for the third consecutive season with 25goals in 31 Premier League games, as well as winning another PFA Player of the Year accolade, despite a groin injury forcing him to miss seven matches. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>his</b> best performance of the season came on 2 February 1997, when Newcastle went into the final 15 minutes of the game 3–1 down at home to Leicester City in the league, only for Shearer to win them the game 4–3 by scoring a late hat-trick.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year Gielgud staged <b>perhaps</b> <b>his</b> most famous Shakespeare production, a Romeo and Juliet {{in which he}} co-starred with Ashcroft and Olivier. Gielgud had spotted Olivier's potential {{and gave him a}} major step up in his career. For the first weeks of the run Gielgud played Mercutio and Olivier played Romeo, after which they exchanged roles. As at Oxford, Ashcroft and Evans were Juliet and the nurse. The production broke all box-office records for the play, running at the New Theatre for 189 performances. Olivier was enraged at the notices after the first night, which praised the virility of his performance but fiercely criticised his speaking of Shakespeare's verse, comparing it with his co-star's mastery of the poetry. The friendship between the two men was prickly, on Olivier's side, {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
