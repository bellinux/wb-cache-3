It was originally organised into ten books, of which nine survive, though it is possible the surviving text represents all the material, rearranged into nine books rather than the original ten. Along with his other surviving botanical work, On the Causes of Plants, Enquiry into Plants was an important influence on science in the middle ages.

[...] According to the one-page preface, probably written by the Queen herself, the work was intended to reach out to those who could not understand the original, and help them not to lose faith.

40|$|The {{majority}} of the world's languages are poorly represented in informational media like radio, television, newspapers, and the Internet. Translation {{into and out of}} these languages may offer a way for speakers of these languages to interact with the wider world, but current statistical machine translation models are only effective with a large corpus of <b>parallel</b> <b>texts</b> - texts in two languages that are translations of one another - which most languages lack. This thesis describes the Babylon project which attempts to alleviate this shortage by supplementing existing <b>parallel</b> <b>texts</b> with texts gathered automatically from the Web [...] specifically targeting pages that contain text in a pair of languages. Results indicate that <b>parallel</b> <b>texts</b> gathered from the Web can be effectively used as a source of training data for machine translation and can significantly improve the translation quality for text in a similar domain. However, the small quantity of high-quality low-density language <b>parallel</b> <b>texts</b> on the Web remains a significant obstacle...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{translation}} is needed when foreigners seek medical care since a trivial mistake is sometimes critical in medical domain. Volunteer interpreters dis-patched by NPOs assist foreign patients during examinations. However, {{only a few}} foreign patients can be assisted {{because the number of}} volunteer interpreters who have specialized technical knowledge about medical services is limited. To solve this problem, we develop a system that constructs a knowledge base of <b>parallel</b> <b>texts</b> including more than 2, 000 sentences multiplied by 20 languages which are more accurate than machine translation and that enables patients to search the translation from the knowledge base. This system consists of three subsystems: a subsystem that enables many volunteers to collaboratively create <b>parallel</b> <b>texts,</b> a subsystem that enables to collect <b>parallel</b> <b>texts</b> automatically from the Web, and a subsystem that enables foreign patients to utilize them. This research develops a collaborative creation platform for multilingual and technical <b>parallel</b> <b>texts,</b> and contributes to assisting foreign patients. To achieve this goal, the following three issues need to be solved...|$|R
