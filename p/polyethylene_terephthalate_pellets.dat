40|$|From {{pharmaceutical}} powders {{to agricultural}} grains, a great {{proportion of the}} materials handled in industrial situations are granular or particulate in nature. The variety of stesses that the matierals may experience and the resulting bulk behaviours may be complex. In agricultural engineering, a better understanding into agricultural processes such as seeding, harvesting, transporting and storing will help to improve the handling of agricultural grains with optimised solutions. A detailed understanding of a granular system is crucial when attempting to model a system, whether it is on a micro (particle) or macro (bulk) scale. As numerical capabilities are ever increasing, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is becoming an increasingly popular numerical technique for computing the behaviour of discrete particels for both industrial and scientific applications. A look into the literature shows a lack of validation of what DEM can predict, specifically with respect to bulk behaviour. In addition, when validation studies are conducted, discrepancies between bulk responses in physical tests and numerical predictions using measured particles properties may arise. The aire {{of this research is}} to develop a methodology to calibrate DEM models for agricultural grains using data meaured in bulk physical tests. The methodology will have a wider application to granular solids in general and will advance understanding in the area of DEM model calibration. A contrasting set of granular materials were used to develop the methodology including 3 inorganic solids (single and paired glass beads, and <b>polyethylene</b> <b>terephthalate</b> <b>pellets)</b> and two organic materials (black eyes beans and black kidney beans). The developed methodology consists of three steps: 1. The development of bulk physical tests to measure the bulk responses that will be used to calibrate the DEM models, 2. The creation of the numerical dataset that will describe how the DEM input parameters influence the bulk responses, and 3. The optimisation of the DEM parameters using a searching algorithm and the results from Step 1 and 2. Two laboratory devices were developed to provide calibration data for the proposed methodology: a rotating drum and an confined compression test. These devices were chosen as they can produce bulk responses that are repeatable and easy to quantify, as well as generate discriminating results in numerical simulations when DEM parameters are varied. The bulk response determined from the rotating drum device was the dynamic angle of repose Ør formed when the granular material in a 40 % filled drum is rotating at a speed of 7 rpm. the confined compression apparatus was used to determine the bulk stiffness of a system by monitoring the change in void ratio from the stress applied during a loading and unloading cycle. The gradient of the loading and unloadng curves termed λ and κ respectively were chosen as the bulk responses to calibrate the DEM models. The experimental results revealed that the dynamic Ør was significantly influences by the particle aspect ration and boundary conditions. The stiffness parameters were found to be predominantly influences by the initial packing arrangement. The numerical dataset describing how the DEM input parameters influence the numerical bulk responses was created by simulating the bulk physical tests, varying selected DEM parameters and monitoring the effects on bulk parameters. To limit the number of simulations required, design of experiment (DOE) methods were used to determine a reduced factorial matrix of simulations. In additions, an extensive parametric investigation on the non-optimised parameters as well as a scaling sensitivity study was carried out. The final step in determining the optimised parameters is to use a searching algorithm to infer the DEM parameters based on the numerical dataset and used the experimental results as calibration data. To perform a comparative study, tow searching algorithms were explored: the first was a simple method based on Microsoft Excel's Solver algorithm coupled with a weighted inverse distance method. The second made used of the statistical analysis program Statistica. It was shown that the Excel Solver algorithm is simpler and quicker to use but for the present first implementation, could only perform an optimisation based on two bulk responses. Statistica required the creation of a staistical model based on the numerical dataset before using the profiling and desirability searching technique, but was able to optimise the parameter using all three bulk responses. A verification and validation of the optimisation methodology was conducted using the optimised parameters for the black eyed beans. A verification was cnducted by simulating the two calibration experiments using the optimsed parameters and comparing these with the experiments. In addition, a validation was peformed by predicting the response of ta shallow footing penetration on a bed of black eyed beans. It was found that DEM simulations using optimised parameters predicted vertical stress on the footing during penetration to an acceptable degree of accuracy for industrial applications (< 10 %) at penetration depths up to 30 mm.

The goal of the Poly Pelletizer project is to create a system that will turn water bottles into <b>polyethylene</b> <b>terephthalate</b> (PET) <b>pellets</b> compatible with extruders to produce 3 -D printer lament, along with other recycling applications. The system promotes a sustainable solution to plastic pollution by giving manufactures, particularly in developing nations, the means to produce their own bulk materials using waste plastic. Shrinking industrial recycling processes to a workbench scale gives individuals the ability to convert excess bottles into seemingly limitless products. The system works by using a dual heating and pressure system to both evenly mix and melt the plastic before pushing the resin through a die.

The hydrolization of <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> film was primarily performed with sodium hydroxide aque-ous solution {{to produce a}} carboxyl-enriched surface. The multilayer films were fabricated by the alternate adsorption of the oppositely charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) and silver nanoparticles on <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> substrate. The assembly process was monitored by UV–VIS spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma. The surface topography and chemical composition of the self-assembly films was characterized by atomic force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The images indicated that the silver nanoparticles were successfully assembled and well distributed on the substrate. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of metallic silver on the <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> substrate. The thermal properties of the multilayer films were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis and dynamic mechanical analyser.

40|$|Thermal {{behaviour}} of blends of {{a liquid}} crystalline copoly(ester amide) (Vectra B 950) with two isotropic polymers {{has been studied}} by differential scanning calorimetry. One of the isotropic polymers is an amorphous polymer – polycarbonate, {{the other is a}} semi-crystalline polymer – <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate).</b> It was found that the glass transition temperature of polycarbonate decreases with increasing Vectra concentration in the blend, suggesting a partial miscibility between the Vectra liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) and polycarbonate. The miscibility is enhanced through heat treatment at elevated temperatures presumably due to a transesterification reaction. Moreover, the presence of the amorphous poly- carbonate hinders the crystallization of the liquid crystalline polymer in the blends. It was also observed that heat treatment of the Vectra LCP and <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> blends causes a loss in crystallinity and shifts in transition temperatures of <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate),</b> indicating that exchange reactions occur between Vectra B 950 and <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate).</b> Based on these results, a new strategy, in situ compatibilization, is proposed to improve the interfacial adhesion between an LCP and an isotropic polymer...|$|R
