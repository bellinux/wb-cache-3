(2) The largest overpayments were due to prices that did not follow HRSA's [...] "penny price" [...] policy in situations to which the statutory 340B <b>ceiling</b> <b>price</b> calculation yielded a negative number. (3) Low-volume entities, manufacturers, and wholesalers were associated with higher rates of overpayments. (4) Inaccuracies in HRSA's <b>ceiling</b> <b>prices</b> limit HRSA's ability to monitor 340B program compliance.Recommendations: (1) HRSA should improve its oversight of the 340B program to ensure that entities are charged at or below the 340B <b>ceiling</b> <b>price.</b> (2) HRSA should provide technical assistance regarding 340B program implementation to all participating entities, manufacturers, and wholesalers. (3) HRSA should publish guidelines regarding its penny price policy. (4) To accurately calculate 340B <b>ceiling</b> <b>prices,</b> HRSA should obtain data on consistent unit of measure and package size.|$|R

50|$|The {{point of}} total {{assumption}} (PTA) {{is a point}} on the cost line of the profit-cost curve determined by the contract elements associated with a fixed price plus incentive-Firm Target (FPI) contract above which the seller effectively bears all the costs of a cost overrun. The seller bears all of the cost risk at PTA and beyond, due to a dollar for dollar decrease in profit beyond the costs at the PTA. In addition, once the costs on an FPI contract reach PTA, the maximum amount the buyer will pay is the <b>ceiling</b> <b>price.</b> Note, however, that between the cost at PTA and when the cost equals the <b>ceiling</b> <b>price,</b> the seller is still in a profitable position; only after costs exceed the <b>ceiling</b> <b>price</b> is the seller in a loss position.|$|R
5000|$|The IMF’s Fact Sheet {{states that}} “Cap-and-trade systems are another option, but {{generally}} {{they should be}} designed to look like taxes through revenue-raising and price stability provisions." [...] Such designs are {{often referred to as}} hybrid designs. The stability provisions referred to are typically floor and <b>ceiling</b> <b>prices</b> (a <b>ceiling</b> <b>price</b> is also known as a safety valve), which are implemented as follows. When permits are auctioned, there is a floor (reserve) price below which permits are not sold, and permits for immediate use are always made available at the <b>ceiling</b> <b>price,</b> even if sales have already reached the permit cap. To the extent the price is controlled by these limits, it is a tax. So if the floor is set equal to the ceiling, cap-and-trade becomes a pure carbon tax.|$|R

5000|$|The {{reason to}} {{calculate}} PTA {{is that when}} executing the contract, actual cost is the only finance measurement. Compare this measurement with the cost base line to calculate Cost Performance Index (CPI), then we can estimate (forecast) the cost at Completion ('EAC' - Estimate at Completion - according to PMBOK, or 'FAC' - Forecast at Completion - in Ms Project). If EAC exceeds PTA, the buyer is expected to pay the <b>ceiling</b> <b>price,</b> and any more overruns beyond PTA will cause a dollar for dollar decrease in profit for the seller. The profit decrease rate become higher, and once actual cost exceeds <b>ceiling</b> <b>price</b> the seller will start losing money(and then might stop working for the contract).|$|R
40|$|Window {{contracts}} and cost plus contracts {{are being used}} for managing risk in long term producer-processor contracting relationships. Window contracts place a floor <b>price</b> and a <b>ceiling</b> <b>price</b> {{on the value of}} the commodity to the producer. Cost plus contacts base the minimum price on the cost of inputs. These contracts can be decomposed into portfolios of specialized put and call options. Monte Carlo option valuation techniques evaluated the impact of different price process assumptions on the values in these contracts. The conclusions are that knowledge of the price process is very important. Mean reverting processes, where the mean is correctly identified, lead to lower valued implied options in both window and spread contracts. Different strike prices are required for different times to maturity if the value offloor price (put option) is to equal the value of the <b>ceiling</b> <b>price</b> (call option) for window contracts. The floor and <b>ceiling</b> <b>prices</b> for window {{contracts and}} the cost plus portion of spread contracts need to change with the expected delivery date.

50|$|A <b>price</b> <b>ceiling</b> is a government-imposed {{price control}} or limit on how high a price is charged for a product. Governments intend <b>price</b> <b>ceilings</b> to protect {{consumers}} from conditions {{that could make}} commodities prohibitively expensive. Such conditions can occur during periods of high inflation or in monopolistic markets. In spite of these goals, a <b>price</b> <b>ceiling</b> can cause problems if imposed {{for a long period}} without controlled rationing, and can lead to shortages. Furthermore, <b>price</b> <b>ceilings</b> can lead to serious problems if a government sets unrealistic prices. In an unregulated market economy <b>price</b> <b>ceilings</b> do not exist.|$|R
40|$|The main {{emphasis}} {{in this study}} is on gas discoveries. They constitute the propelling force behind gas supply, and of the two broad relationships for which results are reported here - namely, discoveries and extensions and revisions - gas discovery is (qualitatively) the more important. Estimates for 1961 - 68 and 1961 - 69 discoveries are reported for a dynamic model, using time series of cross sections. Estimation is done first for a one-intercept model. Alternatively, the units (districts) are grouped by geological and geophysical characteristics, and estimates are derived for the grouped-districts model. This model yields generally better results. The inclusion of 1969 in the sampled period does not alter the results reported for 1961 - 68, and the discussion centers on the 1961 - 69 estimates. Conditional forecasts of 1970 discoveries indicate a drop of one-fifth to one-fourth of 1969 discoveries. The time path of the response of discoveries to the <b>ceiling</b> <b>price</b> of gas is examined, and simulation results for gas discoveries under alternative assumptions about the <b>ceiling</b> <b>price</b> of gas are reported. A procedure for combining the simulation results with available information on future gas requirements is developed to help the FPC in deciding on an appropriate level for the <b>ceiling</b> <b>price</b> of gas. Some policy implications are discussed. ...|$|R

In particular, when the <b>ceiling</b> <b>price</b> is supported by introducing new allowances into the market, firms could choose to buy allowances at the <b>ceiling</b> <b>price,</b> regardless of the prevailing market price, in order to lower the equilibrium price of all allowances. Those purchases could either be transacted by a group of firms intending to manipulate the market or be induced through the introduction of inaccurate information about the cost of emissions abatement that causes firms to purchase allowances at the ceiling.

40|$|The {{restructuring}} of the Spanish oil industry produced a highly concentrated oligopoly in the retail gasoline market. In June 1990 the Spanish government introduced a system of <b>ceiling</b> <b>price</b> regulation {{in order to ensure}} that "liberalization" was accompanied by adequate consumer protection. This paper examines the pricing behavior of the retail gasoline market using multivariate error correction models over the period January 1993 (abolishment of the state monopoly) -December 2004. The results suggest that gasoline retail prices respond symmetrically to increases and decreases in the spot price of gasoline. However, one the <b>ceiling</b> <b>price</b> regulation was abolished, the "collaboration" between the government and the major operators, Repsol-YPF and Cepsa-Elf in order to control the inflation rate results in a slower rate of increase (decrease) of gasoline retail prices when gasoline spot prices went up (went down) than elsewhere in the European Union.

5000|$|One {{research}} paper documenting {{this phenomenon is}} Knittel and Stangel. [...] The authors discovered that in the 1980s in the United States, in states that fixed an interest rate ceiling of 18% firms charged a rate only slightly below the ceiling. But in states without an interest rate ceiling, interest rates were significantly lower. (The authors {{did not find any}} difference in costs which could explain the result.) Another example is Sen et al. [...] who found that gasoline prices were higher in states that instituted <b>price</b> <b>ceilings.</b> We can give here the example of a supreme court of Pakistan decision regarding fixing of a <b>ceiling</b> <b>price</b> for sugar at PKR45/kg. The result was sugar disappeared from the market due to a cartel of sugar producers and the failure of the Pakistani government to maintain supply even in the stores owned by the Government against the large demand of the sugar. The imported sugar require time to reach the country, and it was not feasible to sell at the rate fixed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Eventually the government went for a review petition in the Supreme Court and sought the withdrawal of the earlier decision of the apex court.
