5|$|Coffin {{was born}} on a farm near New Garden in Guilford County, North Carolina on October 28, 1798. He was one of seven {{children}} and the only son of <b>Prudence</b> and Levi Coffin Sr. Both of his parents were devout Quakers. Coffin's father was born in Massachusetts during the 1760s and migrated from Nantucket to North Carolina, {{where he was a}} farmer among a community of Quakers.|$|E
5|$|George Harrison met his wife-to-be, Patricia Boyd, {{on the set}} {{when she}} made a brief (uncredited) {{appearance}} {{as one of the}} schoolgirls on the train. His initial overtures to her were spurned because she had a boyfriend at the time but he persisted and they were married within 18 months. The girl with Boyd in the dining car scene is <b>Prudence</b> Bury. Phil Collins, within a few years a band member of Genesis, was an uncredited schoolboy extra in the concert audience.|$|E
5|$|In November 2010, Hiddleston {{appeared}} with Benedict Cumberbatch, Gemma Arterton, Eddie Redmayne and Rose Byrne among others in Danny Boyle's one time production of The Children's Monologues, {{in which he}} played <b>Prudence,</b> a young girl upset with her mother for her father leaving and excited for her birthday. The play was a one time event of adapted stories of children's first-hand experiences in South Africa being re-interpreted by and performed by various actors.|$|E
5|$|In this maimed Condition the Business of Course went lamely on; {{for a very}} {{middling}} Company of Players {{could be}} expected to bring but thin losing Audiences, especially while Party prevailed, and those very Plays were acted much better in the Haymarket. The unavoidable and melancholy Consequence of this Proceeding was, that there was a Ballance every Saturday Morning in the Office against the Manager, of Fifty or Sixty Pounds; and his Pride, as well as his Honour, were too nearly concerned not to <b>prudence</b> the Deficiency every Week with the utmost Exactness.|$|E
5|$|The {{author of}} the Rule of Saint Benedict, which was the {{principal}} monastic code in Western Europe in the early Middle Ages, was Saint Benedict of Nursia (c. 480–550). Under this rule {{the lives of the}} monks were mainly devoted to prayer, together with reading sacred texts and manual work. They lived a communal life and were required to give complete obedience to their abbot. Benedict's achievement was to produce a stable system characterised by moderation and <b>prudence.</b>|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Tracy sneaks out of {{the house}} to join the protest, which is halted by a police roadblock. The protesters engage in a brawl, while Tracy runs to the Pingletons' home and hides in a fallout shelter. However, Penny's mother, <b>Prudence,</b> reports Tracy to the police before tying her {{daughter}} to her bed. Having been bailed out by Wilbur, Seaweed and his friends help Tracy and Penny escape. Link visits Tracy’s house to look for her and realizes he loves her. Seaweed and Penny also acknowledge their love during the escape.|$|E
5|$|With the news, the English ships {{waited and}} raided the villages on Corvo for supplies. For {{the month of}} July the English ships formed a picket line spaced about six miles apart along a north/south axis. From the {{southern}} flank near Flores Island, the order of ships was Dainty, Golden Dragon, Roebuck, Tiger, Sampson, <b>Prudence</b> and Foresight. The Spanish fleet, which had been sighted briefly, seemed no longer a threat; Alvaro de Bazan had made a major miscalculation: he disobeyed orders and headed further west, allowing the English to first reach the area of interception.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August Dainty sighted a {{large ship}} heading {{directly}} towards them {{and as it}} drew nearer, its enormous size became apparent. The carrack was far larger than Santa Cruz, fully {{three times the size}} of England's biggest ship. Madre de Deus was attacked by the much smaller Dainty. Around midday Newport's Golden Dragon, followed by Roebuck - bigger than Dainty, but only a fraction of the Madre, joined the fray. These were followed at two-hour intervals by Foresight and <b>Prudence</b> in the evening. The Dainty had her foremast shot away and was out of the battle for five hours.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} {{surviving}} sources contemporary {{with the}} rule of Tiberius comes from Velleius Paterculus, who served under Tiberius for eight years (from AD4) in Germany and Pannonia as praefect of cavalry and legatus. Paterculus' Compendium of Roman History spans a period from the fall of Troy {{to the death of}} Livia in AD29. His text on Tiberius lavishes praise on both the emperor and Sejanus. How much of this is due to genuine admiration or <b>prudence</b> remains an open question, but it has been conjectured that he was put to death in AD31 as a friend of Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|Phaedrus was {{suspected}} of having alluded to Sejanus in his Fables and received some unknown punishment short of death (Cf. Fables I.1, I.2.24, and I.17). Velleius Paterculus was a historian and contemporary of Sejanus, whose two-volume The Roman History details a history of Rome from the fall of Troy until the death of Livia Augusta in AD 29. In his work he praised Tiberius and Sejanus, even defending the latter's high position in the government, despite not ranking higher than equestrian. How much of Paterculus' writing is due to genuine admiration, <b>prudence</b> or fear remains an open question, {{but it has been}} conjectured that he was put to death as a friend of Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|Primarily {{the brainchild}} of General Nguyen Chi Thanh, the {{upcoming}} offensive would be timed to provoke a popular general uprising among the South Vietnamese people against the government and its American supporters. Yet <b>prudence</b> required that the South Vietnamese maintain 50 per cent of their forces on standby, while American and allied forces under General William Westmoreland—the Free World Military Forces—remained on full alert. However, despite such measures the fighting at Khe Sanh had largely succeeded in diverting American resources and attention away from Saigon and towards the demilitarized zone, affording the communists the element of surprise.|$|E
5|$|Sheriff Tate {{arrives and}} discovers that Bob Ewell has {{died during the}} fight. The sheriff argues with Atticus about the <b>prudence</b> and ethics of {{charging}} Jem (whom Atticus believes to be responsible) or Boo (whom Tate believes to be responsible). Atticus eventually accepts the sheriff's story that Ewell simply fell on his own knife. Boo asks Scout to walk him home, and after she says goodbye to him at his front door he disappears again. While standing on the Radley porch, Scout imagines life from Boo's perspective, and regrets {{that they had never}} repaid him for the gifts he had given them.|$|E
5|$|The same year, on the {{occasion}} of Eusebi Güell's obtaining the title of count, Gaudí designed a coat of arms for his patron. He devised a shield with the lower part in a catenary shape typical of Gaudí. He divided it into two parts: the lantern of Palau Güell features a dove and a gear-wheel on the right in allusion to the Colònia Güell in Santa Coloma de Cervelló (coloma is Catalan for dove), with the phrase ahir pastor (yesterday Shepherd). On the left is an owl perched on a half-moon—symbol of <b>prudence</b> and wisdom—with the words avuy senyor (today Lord). The shield is surmounted by a helmet with the count's coronet and the dove symbol of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|The carvings are {{all based}} on popular series of engravings, which were often {{published}} in pattern books. Nuremberg was the origin of numerous such books, and one may {{have been brought to}} Edzell by the miner Hans Ziegler. Specifically, the images of the deities are derived from engravings of 1528–29 by the German artist Georg Pencz (or Iorg Bentz, c. 1500–1550), a pupil of Albrecht Dürer; the initials I. B. appear on the carving of Mars. The arts and virtues are both based on engravings derived from paintings by the Flemish artist Marten de Vos. The engravings, by Jan Sadeler and Crispijn de Passe, were widely distributed in Scotland, along with those of the deities. Indeed, the image of <b>Prudence</b> is identical to that used by the King's Master of Works William Schaw, in the spectacular display to welcome Queen Anne to Scotland, following her marriage to James VI in 1589.|$|E
5|$|Articles {{published}} in the 1970s and later suggest that Debierne's results {{published in}} 1904 conflict with those reported in 1899 and 1900. Furthermore, the now-known chemistry of actinium precludes its presence {{as anything other than}} a minor constituent of Debierne's 1899 and 1900 results; in fact, the chemical properties he reported make it likely that he had, instead, accidentally identified protactinium, which would not be discovered for another fourteen years, only to have it disappear due to its hydrolysis and adsorption onto his laboratory equipment. This has led some authors to advocate that Giesel alone should be credited with the discovery. A less confrontational vision of scientific discovery is proposed by Adloff. He suggests that hindsight criticism of the early publications should be mitigated by the then nascent state of radiochemistry: highlighting the <b>prudence</b> of Debierne's claims in the original papers, he notes that nobody can contend that Debierne's substance did not contain actinium. Debierne, who is now considered by the vast majority of historians as the discoverer, lost interest in the element and left the topic. Giesel, on the other hand, can rightfully be credited with the first preparation of radiochemically pure actinium and with the identification of its atomic number 89.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prudence</b> was {{diagnosed}} with cancer, and had two major operations about 1927, and was sent to her sister Eunice's home in Freeport, Illinois to recuperate. As <b>Prudence</b> needed to move to California for her recovery, Wedge and Hugh worked their way to California to establish a home in preparation for her coming. However, <b>Prudence</b> died about May 15, 1928, just after Wedge and Hugh arrived at her bedside in Illinois. <b>Prudence</b> was buried in Oakland, California after a funeral conducted by her husband.|$|E

25|$|After a {{protracted}} friendship, a broken engagement and cancelled wedding plans, Wedge married <b>Prudence</b> Olive Tracy (born March 1872 in Ohio; died May 1928 in Freeport, Illinois), the postmistress of Florence, Nebraska, a northern suburb of Omaha, since 1895, {{a graduate of}} the University of Nebraska, choir singer and concert musician, and the third of the five children of Sarah E. Smalley (born October 1846 in Ohio; died September 2, 1889 in Ohio) and Jonathan Franklin Tracy (born about 1845 in Otway, Ohio), a Wisconsin physician. on December 18, 1910 in Florence, Nebraska. <b>Prudence</b> had previously been engaged, but broke off her engagement to the other man who had decided to migrate to Canada. Wedge and <b>Prudence</b> were soon engaged, and had announced their wedding date, but <b>Prudence</b> cancelled the wedding after a family friend brought to her mother's attention rumors that Wedge had not really reformed but was rather living an immoral life. In 1909 Wedge resigned from the pastorate and relocated to San Francisco to work as a missionary on the Barbary Coast. After their marriage, the Wedges moved to San Francisco.|$|E

25|$|Machiavelli is {{generally}} {{seen as being}} critical of Christianity as it existed in his time, specifically its effect upon politics, and also everyday life. In his opinion, Christianity, along with the teleological Aristotelianism that the church had come to accept, allowed practical decisions to be guided too much by imaginary ideals and encouraged people to lazily leave events up to providence or, as he would put it, chance, luck or fortune. While Christianity sees modesty as a virtue and pride as sinful, Machiavelli took a more classical position, seeing ambition, spiritedness, {{and the pursuit of}} glory as good and natural things, and part of the virtue and <b>prudence</b> that good princes should have. Therefore, while it was traditional to say that leaders should have virtues, especially <b>prudence,</b> Machiavelli's use of the words virtù and prudenza was unusual for his time, implying a spirited and immodest ambition. Famously, Machiavelli argued that virtue and <b>prudence</b> can help a man control more of his future, in the place of allowing fortune to do so.|$|E
