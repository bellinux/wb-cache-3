50|$|Before {{satellite}} communication systems were widely available, {{the only way}} ships at sea had {{to communicate with the}} rest of the world was via radio connections to <b>land</b> <b>stations.</b> To talk to people who did not operate radio equipment, a vessel at sea would make contact with a <b>land</b> <b>station,</b> usually using high frequency AM or single-sideband (SSB) radio. The operator of the <b>land</b> <b>station</b> would patch the radio connection though to a telephone call made over the regular telephone system (referred to as a landline). The AT&T High Seas Service was a commercial radio-to-telephone connection system using the above <b>land</b> <b>stations.</b> The charges were typically settled by making the landline connection a collect call. Larger vessels maintained accounts with AT&T, but the service was available to any vessel with a marine HF radio. In the 1980s the radio link was priced at several dollars per minute plus the long distance landline charge from the High Seas station.|$|R
