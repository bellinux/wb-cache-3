500|$|The vahana (vehicle) of Varahi {{is usually}} {{described}} as a buffalo (Mahisha). In Vaishnava and Shakta images, she is depicted as either standing or seated on a lotus pitha (<b>pedestral)</b> or on her vahana (a buffalo) or on its head, or on a boar, the serpent Shesha, a lion, or on Garuda (the eagle-man vahana of Vishnu). In Tantric Shakta images, the vahana may be specifically a she-buffalo or a corpse (pretasana). [...] An elephant may be depicted as her vahana. The goddess is also described as riding on her horse, Jambini. Garuda may be depicted as her attendant. She may also be depicted seated under a kalpaka tree.|$|E
5000|$|The idol of Sridevi {{is always}} {{placed on the}} right hand side of Sri Malayappa swami. The idol is 26" [...] in height and stands on a 4" [...] <b>pedestral.</b> The panchaloha idol is seen with the left hand in the Kataka hasta pose. In this pose, the fingers are {{partially}} closed, as if holding a lotus. The right hand hangs loosely {{on the side and}} the fingers are held in the Gajakarna pose.|$|E

50|$|The current {{ordination}} hall or ubosoth hall (พระอุโบสถ), {{from the}} entrance, {{is located on}} the left in front of Northern Vihara on lower terrace, originally built by Mongkut and rebuilt by Prajadhipok with design of Narisara Nuvadtivongs in 1932. The ordination hall is a single storey reinforced concrete building with traditional Thai temple glazed tiles roof. The principal Buddha image is the ancient 3.75 metre large white stone craved sitting Buddha image on the lotus petals shaped <b>pedestral.</b> The image was built in Dvaravati period. Originally enshrined in the abandoned Na Phra Meru Temple, in the south of Phra Pathommachedi. In 1861 Mongkut moved the Buddha image to be the principal image of the ordination hall. There are four marble Bai Sema attached into the hall, and at the entrance adorned by two stone Chinese lion statues. The front facade depicting Dharmacakra and two sitting deers.|$|E
50|$|Officially {{the main}} {{entrance}} of Phra Pathommachedi complex. Eastern Vihara or Viharn Luang (วิหารหลวง) is a single storey reinforced concrete building with traditional Thai temple glazed tiles roof built by Mongkut on 18 December 1861. Inside has two rooms, inner room and outer room. The inner room has mural paintings depicting the stories of restoration of Phra Pathommachedi throughout the history and the gathering of heaven. The mural was paint {{during the reign of}} Vajiravudh with interesting mix of Dvaravati and modern Thai styles. There is no wall on the side of Phra Pathommachaedi to allow worshipper to see the stupa. Directly opposite the vihara is a gilded niche attached to Phra Pathommachedi. Inside the niche is the copy image of Phra Phuttha Sihing from the Front Palace. The outer room housing the principal Buddha image of the Eastern Vihara, Phra Nirantarai (พระนิรันตราย), also built by Mongkut, behind the image has mural painting of sacred tree. In the front of vihara has a portico housing Phra Phuttha Maha Vajira Maravichai Buddha image (พระพุทธมหาวชิรมารวิชัย), built by crown prince Vajiralongkorn in 1984 when he was a Bhikku. In 2001 on behalf of Sirikit, Vajiralongkorn installed the Buddha image on the newly built <b>pedestral.</b> On the lower terrace in front of vihara has ordination hall, meditation hall and a platform erected specially for a king to mount an elephant or a palanquin.|$|E
40|$|The Tamamushi Shrine (Tamamushi-no-zushi) is an {{excellent}} art in woodwork, laquer and metalwork, which has been handed down at Horyu-ji tenple in Nara. This is {{only a little more}} two meters in height, and consists of a palace struture at top and a high <b>pedestral.</b> The <b>pedestral</b> is called Shumi-dan that symbolizes Mt Sumeru {{in the center of the}} world. Though its date is considered about the 7 th century, its first place of installation is still uncertain. The texts concerning its iconography are still now on the discussion. On my opinion, many subjects of its paintings could be found in the first chapter of the Lotus Sutra...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} a {{four year}} {{program on the}} use of the laser-heated <b>pedestral</b> growth (LHPG) process for the preparation of long, flexible fibers of the high T{sub c} copper-oxide ceramic superconductors having wire-like morphology. The major question addressed was whether the LHPG method could produce high T{sub c} fibers of Bi{sub 2 }Sr{sub 2 }CaCu{sub 2 }O{sub 8 } (2212) in lengths long enough for use as superconducting wires. Cold-pressing and sintering methods were developed to prepare uniform, single phase ceramic feedstock. Phase equilibrium studies revealed the relationship between thermal gradients, interface shape and phases produced by the LHPG process during incongruent solidification. The highest critical current densities over measured in bulk samples of Bi- 2212 material, 60, 000 A/cm{sup 2 } at 68 K, were achieved in single crystal and/or highly grain-oriented fibers. The first ever flexible, multi-cm fibers ({le} 100 {mu}m in diameter) were prepared. Fibers diameters were ultimately reduced to 25 {mu}m (1 cm in length), and we were able to grow them up to 14 cm in length (100 {mu}m diameter). These fibers could be bent in radii less than 5 cm, but max. growth rates of {approximately} 10 mm/hr did not permit them to be grown long enough for prototype motor windings. Superconducting Bi- 2212 grain-aligned ribbons were grown for the first time by the LHPG method using platinum guide wires...|$|E
