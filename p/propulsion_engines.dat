5|$|Xenon is the {{preferred}} propellant for ion propulsion of spacecraft because it has low ionization potential per atomic weight and can be stored as a liquid at near room temperature (under high pressure), yet easily evaporated to feed the engine. Xenon is inert, environmentally friendly, and less corrosive to an ion engine than other fuels such as mercury or caesium. Xenon was first used for satellite ion engines during the 1970s. It was later employed as a propellant for JPL's Deep Space 1 probe, Europe's SMART-1 spacecraft and for the three ion <b>propulsion</b> <b>engines</b> on NASA's Dawn Spacecraft.|$|E

25|$|Based on work in {{the late}} 1950s to the early 1960s, it has been {{technically}} possible to build spaceships with nuclear pulse <b>propulsion</b> <b>engines,</b> i.e. driven {{by a series of}} nuclear explosions.

25|$|A typical {{rocket engine}} {{can handle a}} {{significant}} fraction of its own mass in propellant each second, with the propellant leaving the nozzle at several kilometres per second. This means that the thrust-to-weight ratio of a rocket engine, and often the entire vehicle can be very high, in extreme cases over 100. This compares with other jet <b>propulsion</b> <b>engines</b> that can exceed 5 {{for some of the}} better engines.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} British VTOL {{project was}} the gyrodyne, where a rotor is powered during take-off and landing but which then freewheels during flight, with separate <b>propulsion</b> <b>engines</b> providing forward thrust. Starting with the Fairey Gyrodyne, {{this type of}} aircraft later evolved into the much larger twin-engined Fairey Rotodyne, that used tipjets to power the rotor on take-off and landing but which then used two Napier Eland turboprops driving conventional propellers mounted on substantial wings to provide propulsion, the wings serving to unload the rotor during horizontal flight. The Rotodyne was developed to combine the efficiency of a fixed-wing aircraft at cruise with the VTOL capability of a helicopter to provide short haul airliner service from city centres to airports.|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of the paper {{presents}} a survey of approaches to maintenance over the last thirty years. A structure of maintenance costs and maintenance concept adjustment and design (MA-CAD) of ship machinery (<b>propulsion</b> <b>engine)</b> is presented here, which provides the required safety level and lowest costs in a life cycle. Improvement and extension of the MA-CAD method can be achieved by analysis of the most common important parts of the <b>propulsion</b> <b>engine</b> that fail, mostly in operation, by designing maintenance intervals and planning spare parts quantity. A diesel-engine propulsion system with gearbox has been chosen for the research. The data on failure and maintenance activities at <b>propulsion</b> <b>engine</b> breakdown in a seaway within a period of thirteen years have been obtained from the engineâ€²s log book. The critical parts that fail mostly in operation are defined by an analysis of breakdowns (registered failure cycles). The critical components include the exhaust valve, injection valve and fuel pump. The most vulnerable part of the <b>propulsion</b> <b>engine</b> is the exhaust valve with the highest failure rate. By application of the method mentioned we obtain a model for the maintenance concept adjustment and design. The suggested model consists of two parts (a new MA-CAD) : the ship and office. The engine machinery behaviour is monitored aboard the ship (failures and maintenance functioning) and the data are sent to the office. On the basis of the data, the office performs the analysis and adjusts (the models) maintenance concept...|$|R
