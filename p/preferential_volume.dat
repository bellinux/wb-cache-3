40|$|The phase {{separation}} between a striped polaron liquid at the particular density {{and a high}} density polaron liquid is described by a modified Van der Waals scheme. The striped polaron liquid represents the pseudo gap matter or Wigner-like polaron phase at 1 / 8 doping in cuprate superconductors. The model includes the tendency of pseudo- Jahn-Teller polarons to form anisotropic directional bonds at a <b>preferential</b> <b>volume</b> {{with the formation of}} different liquid phases. The model gives the coexistence of a first low density polaron striped liquid and a second high density liquid that appears in cuprate superconductors for doping larger than 1 / 8. We discuss how the strength of anisotropic bonds controls the variation the {{phase separation}} scenarios for complex systems {{in the presence of a}} quantum critical point where the phase separation vanishes.

40|$|Silicon {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{attractive}} anode materials for use in Li-ion batteries due to its ∼ 10 times higher specific capacity than existing graphite anodes. However, up to 400 % volume expansion during reaction with Li causes particle pulverization and fracture, which results in rapid capacity fading. Although Si nanomaterials have shown improvements in electrochemical performance, there is limited understanding of how volume expansion takes place. Here, we study the shape and volume changes of crystalline Si nanopillars with different orientations upon first lithiation and discover anomalous behavior. Upon lithiation, the initially circular cross sections of nanopillars with 〈 100 〉, 〈 110 〉, and 〈 111 〉 axial orientations expand into cross, ellipse, and hexagonal shapes, respectively. We explain this by identifying a high-speed lithium ion diffusion channel along the 〈 110 〉 direction, which causes <b>preferential</b> <b>volume</b> expansion along this direction. Surprisingly, the 〈 111 〉 and 〈 100 〉 nanopillars shrink in height after partial lithiation, while 〈 110 〉 nanopillars increase in height. The length contraction is suggested to be due to a collapse of the { 111 } planes early in the lithiation process. These results give new insight into the Si volume change process and could help in designing better battery anodes. © 2011 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{modified}} Van der Waals {{scheme for}} cuprates {{to give the}} co-existence of multiple phase separations in cuprates is presented. The model includes the tendency of charge carriers to form anisotropic directional bonds at <b>preferential</b> <b>volumes</b> {{for the formation of}} different “liquid phases”. We obtain the variation of the pseudogap temperature T*() (for phase separation between pseudogap matter and normal matter) with hole density () in agreement with experiments.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the effects of {{macromolecular}} crowding on protein folding kinetics by studying the oxidative refolding of hen lysozyme in the absence and presence of high concentrations of bovine serum albumin and Ficoll 70, The heterogeneity characteristic of the lysozyme refolding process is preserved under crowded conditions. This, together with the observation that the refolding intermediates that accumulate to significant levels are very similar in the absence and presence of Ficoll, suggests that crowding does not alter substantially the energetics of the protein folding reaction. However, the presence of high concentrations of macromolecules results in the acceleration of the fast track of the refolding process whereas the slow track is substantially retarded, The results {{can be explained by}} <b>preferential</b> excluded <b>volume</b> stabilization of compact states relative to more unfolded states, and suggest that, relative to dilute solutions, the rates of many protein folding processes are likely to be altered under conditions that more closely resemble the intracellular environment...|$|R
40|$|Understanding and {{modeling}} water flow behavior {{at the field}} scale is integral to various environmental and agricultural applications. Unfortunately, this understanding is challenged with preferential flows rendering the use of Darcian fluxes, developed at the laboratory scale, unable to describe the flow at the field. Preferential paths development {{in the field is}} the result of the complex interaction of multiple processes relating to the soil 2 ̆ 7 s structure, moisture level, shrinkage induces stresses, and biological activities. Visualizing and characterizing the cracking behavior and preferential paths evolution of soils across the soil depth has always been one of the key challenges and a major barrier against scaling up existing hydrologic concepts and models to account for preferential flows. In this study, the evolution of soil 2 ̆ 7 s internal stress due to shrinkage as well as the effect of shrinkage on TDR estimates of water contents are explored at the laboratory scale. Then, the evolution of the <b>preferential</b> paths <b>volume</b> at different soil depths and moisture conditions is assessed by a new methodology to visualize preferential paths at the field scale. Results from different soil types (the savage soil vs. the Chalmers soil) and different landuses (corn/tilled field vs. soy bean no-till fields in the Chalmers soil) are presented. Finally, the effect of introducing scaling concepts to the hydrology curriculum is explored by quantifying its effect on students 2 ̆ 7 enhanced knowledge and decision making skills. ...|$|R
40|$|Recuperative {{parametric}} pumping in adsorptive membranes, {{a cyclical}} adsorptive separation process, {{can lead to}} two distinct mechanisms of separation: rejection and preferential transport. During rejection, the adsorptive membrane rejects an adsorbing solute while permitting the transport of nonadsorbing solutes. During preferential transport the reverse occurs; the adsorptive membrane selectively transports an adsorbing solute while preventing the transport of nonadsorbing solutes. Switching from rejection to preferential transport {{can be accomplished by}} merely decreasing the ratio of the stroke volume (cyclical volume of solution pumped {{into and out of the}} membrane) to the membrane void <b>volume.</b> <b>Preferential</b> transport, earlier called an “inverse separation,” results from the adsorbing solute crossing over from an adsorbing to a desorbing region in the interior of the membrane and is governed by the shape of the equilibrium isotherms and by process variables. In experiments with lysozyme and a membrane chromatography cartridge, selectivities obtained by preferential transport were on the order of 5 and agreed with theoretical predictions. Theoretical predictions suggest that to further improve separation by preferential transport, experiments need to be conducted on low dispersion membranes (Pe > 10 4) and that both rejection and preferential transport can lead to continuous concentrated streams of the adsorbing solutes...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the adsorption behaviour of adsorbate molecules upon activated carbon. Limitations in bulk gravimetric measurements mean that the mechanism of adsorption for adsorbates upon carbonaceous materials is poorly characterised. The information obtained from NMR experiments performed upon the adsorbate molecules is applied to provide additional understanding of the adsorption process. A systematic study of a phosphate/phosphonate - adsorbent system is performed, and a theoretical basis for the results observed is discussed in terms of molecular mobility and the penetration of molecules into pores of differing sizes. Calculated pore volumes obtained from NMR data are discussed. It is demonstrated that phosphate and phosphonate molecules adsorb initially within larger pores at the surface of the adsorbent and subsequently progress deeper within the porous volume. The effects of magic-angle spinning and proton decoupling upon the adsorbate spectra obtained are also addressed. Relaxation measurements are used to study the motional freedom of adsorbed molecules and the measurements provide further corroboration to the interpretation of spectra expounded. The study is then extended to analyse the adsorption of adsorbate molecules upon carbon adsorbents with other adsorbate molecules pre-adsorbed. Analysis of spectra provides information upon the movement of both the primarily adsorbed material and secondary adsorbate within the pore <b>volume.</b> <b>Preferential</b> adsorption of phosphate molecules over water molecules is demonstrated. Finally, dynamic NMR techniques are used to characterise the exchange of adsorbate within the porous volume with excess adsorbate upon the exterior of the carbon adsorbent...|$|R
40|$|More {{and more}} linear {{alkylbenzene}} sulfonate (LAS) has contaminated {{the water and}} soil via pollution discharge, making it important to identify the ecological behavior and toxicity of LAS so as to carry out measures that will reduce its negative effects on the ecosystem. The ecological behavior of LAS, including degradation, migration, and plant uptake, in both soil-paddy rice and soil-soybean systems was studied. Reduction of LAS in pot and field plots followed the first order reaction kinetics with degradation half-lives of 35 - 50 days with LAS decreasing to very low concentrations after a season of crop growth. Strong inigration ability for LAS was found and the breakthrough time in a 1. 5 m soil monolith was significantly shortened to 23 days by <b>preferential</b> flow. Leachate <b>volumes</b> of soil-paddy and soil-soybean systems at preferential breakthrough were much different, while the leachate volumes at equilibrium governed by soil adsorption/ desorption processes were very similar. Significant uptake of LAS in both paddy rice and soybeans was observed in pot and field experiments (P < 0. 05). In aquatic culture, 20 mu g mL(- 1) and above of LAS significantly inhibited the growth of paddy seedlings (P < 0. 05). The critical concentration for LAS in soil inhibiting the growth and yield of paddy was 160 mu g g(- 1); when higher, {{there was a strong}} negative influence, with decreases in height, spike length, and production; when lower than 80 mu g g(- 1), paddy growth was stimulated. There was little effect of LAS on soybeans...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the potential {{advantages and disadvantages}} of adopting a common currency arrangement among the six IMF member Pacific island countries that have their own national currency. These countries are Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu. The study explains that the present exchange rate regimes-comprising pegging to a basket of currencies for five countries and the floating arrangement for Papua New Guinea-have generally succeeded in avoiding inflationary, balance of payments, external debt, and financial system problems. The study concludes that adopting a common currency in the Pacific would require greater convergence of domestic policies and substantial strengthening of regional policies, which would take time to achieve.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the euro generated substantial interest in measuring the impact of currency unions (CUs) on trade flows. Rose''s (2000) initial estimates suggested a tripling of trade and created a literature in search of "more reasonable" CU effects. A recent meta-analysis of this literature shows that subsequent papers quantify CU trade impacts at 30 - 90 percent. However, most recent studies use shorter time series and fewer countries than Rose in his original work. We revisit Rose''s original benchmark, extend the dataset, and address Baldwin''s (2006) critiques regarding the proper specification of gravity models in large panels by simultaneously accounting for multilateral resistance and unobserved bilateral heterogeneity. This produces a robust average CU trade effect of 45 percent. Yet, the trade impacts of individual CUs vary substantially and are generally lower than those of preferential trade agreements (PTAs). Our revised benchmark {{can be used as a}} yardstick for future studies to delineate how estimates differ due to new data or differences in econometric specifications.

40|$|South-South trade {{agreements}} are proliferating: Developing countries signed 70 new agreements between 1990 and 2003. Yet {{the impact of}} these agreements is largely unknown. This paper focuses on the static effects of South-South preferential {{trade agreements}} stemming from changes in trade patterns. Specifically, it estimates the impact of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) on Uganda''s imports between 1994 and 2003. Detailed import and tariff data at the 6 -digit harmonized system level are used for more than 1, 000 commodities. Based on a difference-in-difference estimation strategy, the paper finds that-in contrast to evidence from aggregate statistics-COMESA''s preferential tariff liberalization has not considerably increased Uganda''s trade with member countries, on average across sectors. The effect, however, is heterogeneous across sectors. Finally, the paper finds no evidence of trade-diversion effects.

40|$|The present work {{concerns}} {{with the study}} of debris flows and, in particular, with the related hazard in the Alpine Environment. During the last years several methodologies {{have been developed to}} evaluate hazard associated to such a complex phenomenon, whose velocity, impacting force and inappropriate temporal prediction are responsible of the related high hazard level. This research focuses its attention on the depositional phase of debris flows through the application of a numerical model (DFlowz), and on hazard evaluation related to watersheds morphometric, morphological and geological characterization. The main aims are to test the validity of DFlowz simulations and assess sources of errors in order to understand how the empirical uncertainties influence the predictions; on the other side the research {{concerns with}} the possibility of performing hazard analysis starting from the identification of susceptible debris flow catchments and definition of their activity level. 25 well documented debris flow events have been back analyzed with the model DFlowz (Berti and Simoni, 2007) : derived form the implementation of the empirical relations between event volume and planimetric and cross section inundated areas, the code allows to delineate areas affected by an event by taking into account information about <b>volume,</b> <b>preferential</b> flow path and digital elevation model (DEM) of fan area. The analysis uses an objective methodology for evaluating the accuracy of the prediction and involve the calibration of the model based on factors describing the uncertainty associated to the semi empirical relationships. The general assumptions on which the model is based have been verified although the predictive capabilities are influenced by the uncertainties of the empirical scaling relationships, which have to be necessarily taken into account and depend mostly on errors concerning deposited volume estimation. In addition, in order to test prediction capabilities of physical-based models, some events have been simulated through the use of RAMMS (RApid Mass MovementS). The model, which has been developed by the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) in Birmensdorf and the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research (SLF) takes into account a one-phase approach based on Voellmy rheology (Voellmy, 1955; Salm et al., 1990). The input file combines the total volume of the debris flow located in a release area with a mean depth. The model predicts the affected area, the maximum depth and the flow velocity in each cell of the input DTM. Relatively to hazard analysis related to watersheds characterization, the database collected by the Alto Adige Province represents an opportunity to examine debris-flow sediment dynamics at the regional scale and analyze lithologic controls. With the aim of advancing current understandings about debris flow, this study focuses on 82 events in order to characterize the topographic conditions associated with their initiation, transportation and deposition, seasonal patterns of occurrence and examine the role played by bedrock geology on sediment transfer. ...|$|R
