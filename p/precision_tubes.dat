Constantly increasing demands on the pipe geometry and properties of materials perfectly satisfied by cold rolling (HPT), which evolves by optimizing the modes of deformation and improvement of equipment for its implementation. It offers system-modular approach to modernize the equipment of cold rolling mills, realizing one of the few non-waste technologies for the production of products with high consumer characteristics. The main producers of cold-rolled pipes mills (company SMS Meer and NGOs EZTM) more than a 80 year period of existence and development of technology HPT released about a thousand mill pipe diameters from 4 to 450 mm. Findings. System-modular approach to the unit that implements the method of production of goods HPT, based on the analysis of both technological and regime of the functioning of its mechanisms, and design options for their execution and layout, allows efficient use of the existing equipment and, if necessary, to expand its capabilities. The growing demand for cold-rolled tube can be satisfied both by the modernization of existing units and replacing them with new ones. For the design and manufacture of advanced mill HPT Ukraine has not only technical capabilities but also professionals able to offer solutions {{at the level of the}} best world standards.

Solely using pure analytical solution method, energy-based analytical solution method, pure explicit algorithm or implicit algorithm cannot accurately predict the wrinkling instability. In this study, the analytical bifurcation solution, analytical-numerical energy-based model and eigenvalue buckling analysis are conducted to generate different kinds of buckling modes, respectively, and a series of imperfections are defined in the shapes of these buckling modes. Second, by assigning the geometrical imperfection into the perfect mesh of the tube, a series of hybrid explicit FE models for numerical control rotary-draw-bending is established. The numerical perturbation analyses are carried out with different bifurcation modes-shapes. Thus, based on the minimum energy principle, the shape of imperfection (bifurcation path) and the magnitude of the imperfection (scaling factors) are chosen, which is corresponded to the lowest level of energy consumption.

In this study, by using the energy principle, combined with analytical and finite element (FE) numerical methods, an energy-based wrinkling prediction model for thin-walled tube bending is developed. A segment shell model is proposed to consider the critical wrinkling region, which captures the deformation features of the tube bending process. The dissipation energy created by the reaction forces at the tube-dies interface for restraining the compressive instability is {{also included in the}} prediction model, which can be numerically calculated via FE simulation. The validation of the model is performed and its physical significance is evaluated from various aspects. Then the plastic wrinkling behaviors in thin-walled tube bending are addressed. From the energy viewpoint, the effect of the basic parameters including the geometrical and material parameters on the onset of wrinkling is identified. In particular, the influence of multi-tools constraints such as clearance and friction at various interfaces on the wrinkling instability is obtained.
