In 1987 Reynolds moved to a software model with its first release of the ERA dealer management software, which was a complete rewrite of its prior programming. ERA allows users to manage logistics for sales, finance, service and parts across departments. That same year Reynolds developed a digital, graphical <b>parts</b> <b>catalog</b> program for selecting and ordering automotive parts.

Ford Motor Company allowed him to have a fleet of new vehicles every year, and one of Bob's choices was the Comtech Mark VII. Larry Albedi Motors (Lincoln-Mercury) in Vallejo, California serviced the vehicle a couple of times before it was returned to Ford {{at the end of the}} year.

50|$|This engine being {{based on}} British/American Rover V8/Buick 215 block {{is a common}} misconception, as the Rover/Buick V8 (although quite similar in {{appearance}} and size) had five cylinder-head studs per cylinder (14 studs per head with six shared studs in-between-cylinders) configuration that cannot accommodate the six stud (18 studs per head with six shared studs between cylinders) Repco RB620 heads. The difference in block design originated in Oldsmobile's intention to produce the higher power, turbo-charged Jetfire version. GM's later use of parts diagrams drawn for Oldsmobile in Buick <b>parts</b> <b>catalog</b> showing a six-stud cylinder block further fueled the confusion.|$|E

50|$|Mitchell 1, {{established}} in 1918 as Reed Electrical Manuals, has undergone many changes {{over the last}} 90-plus years, including name and ownership changes. Glenn Mitchell founded the well known “Mitchell Manuals” in his garage in 1946.

His repair manuals were unique to the industry because they arranged collision parts by the quadrant of the car {{where they would be}} used. Previously, repair manuals listed component parts, just like the manufacturers’ manuals.

This engine also has an inherent design flaw with the TWC temperature sensor (part no. A005 153 40 28) and the part in the electronic <b>parts</b> <b>catalog</b> is now specifying part no.

40|$|Abstract. As value {{networks}} evolve, {{we observe}} {{the phenomenon of}} businesses consolidating through mergers and businesses disaggregating and then virtually “re-merging ” dynamically to respond to new opportunities. But these constituent businesses were not built in any standard way, and neither were their IT systems.

Companies that merge can spend a year integrating their catalogs, by which its time for the next deal. As such, business object integration has become a key aspect of today’s enterprise.

50|$|The chief {{advantage}} of loose-leaf paper is its flexibility and economy in use. A punched {{sheet of paper}} can be inserted into a ring binder, removed for separate use, {{and then returned to}} the binder. Different sheets can be organized into a different order in a binder, or removed entirely and refiled in another binder, or disposed of as needed. This ability to rearrange and update the contents of binders is convenient for students and other workers, who can carry only the papers they are likely to need on a given day, while leaving the remainder elsewhere. The ability to add or remove an arbitrary number of pages has been useful for reference works that are frequently updated, such as computer software manuals, <b>parts</b> <b>catalogs,</b> and legal indexes.|$|R
