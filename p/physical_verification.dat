Keeping biological information, such as the face, fingerprints, and irises, concealed from others in daily life is difficult, and therefore theft and counterfeit of exposed biological information can be relatively easily accomplished by first capturing an individual’s targeted information as an image and then using the data to reproduce a model. Here, I propose a new method of <b>physical</b> biometric <b>verification</b> that uses dynamic data which are difficult to spoof.

40|$|Title: <b>Physical</b> fitness <b>verification</b> of {{the members}} of FRS Objective: The goal of the thesis was to compare the results {{of the members}} of FRS CR in Cooper test with the results of <b>physical</b> fitness <b>verification.</b> Partial goal was to {{separate}} the members of HZS ČR into two groups according to the type of verification they choose - running or swimming and to compare these groups with the norm based on the Cooper test. Methods: In the thesis there were used data of the physical tests, which are verifying the physical fitness {{of the members of}} the Fire Rescue Service of the Czech Republic and the statistics of rescue activities. Next the members of FRS CR were subjected to a Cooper test and the data were then standardised and evaluated. Results: Based on the analysis two hypothesis were verified. First hypothesis was confirmed, second declined (disproved). All tested members in the Cooper test achieved physical fitness above the population standard. Better results in the Cooper tests achieved the group, which chose for physical testing. Keywords: training, competence, firefighter, condition, testin...|$|R
40|$|The large neutron {{multiplicity}} counter (LNMC), {{also known}} as the 30 -gal. -drum neutron multiplicity counter, has now been used successfully by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the Initial <b>Physical</b> Inventory <b>Verification</b> (IPIV) and the first annual <b>Physical</b> Inventory <b>Verification</b> (PIV) of excess weapons plutonium oxide at the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS). These excess plutonium oxide materials contain a variety of impurities. They are stored two cans to a 10 -gal. -drum. The drums contain from 1. 3 to 4. 0 kg of plutonium. The isotopic declarations vary from can to can but the material averages 6 % {sup 240 }Pu. During the IPIV, 94 samples were measured in the LNMC; 19 were measured during the PIV. The assays for all but a single drum agreed to within three standard deviations of the declared value. This problematic drum could not be measured by the LNMC because of its unusually high neutron emission rate.
