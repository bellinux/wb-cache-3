6000|$|Varieties then arise we {{know not}} why; {{and it is}} more than {{probable}} that the majority of varieties have arisen in this [...] "spontaneous" [...] manner, though we are, of course, far from denying that they may be traced, in some cases, to distinct external influences; which are assuredly competent to alter the character of the tegumentary covering, to change colour, to increase or diminish the size of muscles, to modify constitution, and, among plants, to give rise to the metamorphosis of stamens into petals, and so forth. But however they may have arisen, what especially interests us at present is, to remark that, once in existence, many varieties obey the fundamental law of reproduction that like tends to produce like; and their offspring exemplify it by tending to exhibit the same deviation from the <b>parental</b> <b>stock</b> as themselves. Indeed, there seems to be, in many instances, a prepotent influence about a newly-arisen variety which gives it what one may call an unfair advantage over the normal descendants from the same stock. This is strikingly exemplified by the case of Gratio Kelleia, who married a woman with the ordinary pentadactyle extremities, and had by her four children, Salvator, George, André, and Marie. Of these children Salvator, the eldest boy, had six fingers and six toes, like his father; the second and third, also boys, had five fingers and five toes, like their mother, though the hands and feet of George were slightly deformed. The last, a girl, had five fingers and five toes, but the thumbs were slightly deformed. The variety thus reproduced itself purely in the eldest, while the normal type reproduced itself purely in the third, and almost purely in the second and last: so that it would seem, at first, as if the normal type were more powerful than the variety. But all these children grew up and intermarried with normal wives and husband, and then, note what took place: Salvator had four children, three of whom exhibited the hexadactyle members of their grandfather and father, while the youngest had the pentadactyle limbs of the mother and grandmother; so that here, notwithstanding a double pentadactyle dilution of the blood, the hexadactyle variety had the best of it. The same pre-potency of the variety was still more markedly exemplified in the progeny of two of the other children, Marie and George. Marie (whose thumbs only were deformed) gave birth to a boy with six toes, and three other normally formed children; but George, who was not quite so pure a pentadactyle, begot, first, two girls, each of whom had six fingers and toes; then a girl with six fingers on each hand and six toes on the right foot, but only five toes on the left; and lastly, a boy with only five fingers and toes. In these instances, therefore, the variety, as it were, leaped over one generation to reproduce itself in full force in the next. Finally, the purely pentadactyle André was the father of many children, not one of whom departed from the normal parental type.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The black prochilodus, Prochilodus nigricans, is an {{important}} food fish distributed throughout aquatic habitats of the Ecuadorian Amazon. We sampled gonad weight, body condition, and feeding of this species {{to address the question}} of whether changes in these biological parameters are related to hydrological variation and migration patterns.

Mature individuals make lateral migrations from peripheral flooded habitats to large white water rivers to spawn.

40|$|Abstract. —The {{examination}} of population-specific adaptations of introduced salmonids {{to the wide}} range of environments found in Patagonia (southern South America) can help unveil some of the genetic and environmental contributions to life history variation. The rainbow trout On-corhynchus mykiss introduced into Argentina originated from a few <b>parental</b> <b>stocks.</b> Although some of these stocks were anadromous, all of the dozens of established populations described until now have been freshwater resident. In this paper we provide the first documentation of the presence of an anadromous run of rainbow trout in the Santa Cruz River, the second largest river of Argentinean Patagonia. Microsatellite analysis revealed that anadromous and resident fish from the Santa Cruz River are genetically indistinguishable, probably representing alternative life his-tories within the same population. Both wild types are very different from the fish of Danish origin that were reared in a local hatchery, suggesting that they are descended more directly from Cal-ifornia stocks or that they have been affected by strong drift or selection. Marine growth and freshwater residence are comparable to those of California steelhead. River entrance peaks in early fall. Population age structure and scale pattern analysis indicate that fish enter the river at age 3 but that most do not spawn until their next river entry as 4 -year-olds.

Associated with the opposite trends in Trf-BB genotype frequencies between years were significant differences in the growth rates of juveniles in 1974 and 1975 (P 0. 05). Cottontails of the Trf-BC genotype were found to be significantly more difficult to capture than those of the Trf-BB in 1975 with 35. 1 and 26. 3 trapnights required per capture, respectively (P 0. 05). No {{significant differences were found between}} the sex and age structure of the hunted sample of September 1975 and the trapped population of August 1975 (P > 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies on}} the ecology of marine larvae suggest that {{retention}} near coastal areas and self-recruitment are probably much more common than previously thought. In light of this, the advective potential of pelagic stages can be partially determined by the timing of propagule release. We sampled the upper-shore levels of a subtropical coastline in southeastern Brazil to examine the temporal patterns of propagule release for the common barnacle Chthamalus bisinuatus and the periwinkle Nodilittorina lineolata. The release timing in both species was very consistent between sites a few kilometers apart. Barnacles released nauplii in a rhythmic pattern, mostly coinciding with neap tides, when the speed of tidal currents was lowest. There was no variation in propagule release in relation to diel or flood-ebb tidal cycles. Periwinkles released propagules in a very irregular pattern, which remarkably matched a time series of wave heights. Egg capsules were released during periods of rough seas, when onshore surface currents were expected to prevail. Eggs were released mostly during ebb tides, {{and there was no}} diel variation. Propagule release rhythms are usually viewed as a means to ensure fast offshore advection, thus avoiding presumed hazardous conditions for larvae. However, propagule release strategies in these upper-shore species would more likely contribute to the retention of offspring close to <b>parental</b> <b>stocks.</b> FAPESP[2008 / 10085 - 5]FAPESP[06 / 58700 - 4...|$|R
30|$|Current {{databases}} of Phyllostachys pubescens full-length cDNAs (FL-cDNAs) {{provide a}} rich source of sequences for the development of potential FL-cDNA simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. We screened 10, 608 P. pubescens cDNAs, discovering 1614 SSRs in 1382 SSR-containing FL-cDNAs. The SSRs were more abundant within transposable elements (TEs) than expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and genome survey sequences (GSSs), and specific dinucleotide repeats tended to associate with particular TE families: (TA)n with En/Spm and (CT)n with Mutator. A selected panel of 100 FL-cDNAs containing type I SSRs yielded 68 functional SSR markers with an average polymorphism information content (PIC) value of 0.12, among which 22 loci contained polymorphisms. These markers became less transferrable (83.1 %[*]→[*] 69.9 %[*]→[*] 49.3 %) but more polymorphic (79.4 %[*]→[*] 92.3 %[*]→[*] 92.8 %) with increasing phylogenetic distance (intra-genus[*]→[*]intra-subtribe[*]→[*]intra-family). Transferability and polymorphism also depended on the location of the marker, with those located in the coding region being more transferrable (69.1 %) and less polymorphic (89.4 %) than those in the 5 ′-UTR (63.4 % transferable, 90.7 % polymorphic) and the 3 ′-UTR (61.8 % transferable, 91.4 % polymorphic). As proof of principle, we were able to use our FL-cDNA SSR markers to identify the <b>parental</b> <b>stocks</b> in interspecific hybrids of bamboo within and beyond P. pubescens, and estimate the outcrossing rate for P. pubescens. Our research should facilitate molecular breeding in bamboo species where original genetic markers are scarce.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of genetic {{constitution}} (stock) and rearing temperature on the occurrence of hemorrhages in thighs and breasts of water bath stunned broilers was investigated. Particular attention {{was given to the}} relation between the susceptibility for hemorrhages, body composition, and adaptations in blood variables induced by low rearing temperatures. A factorial experiment was performed with five <b>parental</b> <b>stocks,</b> differing with respect to growth rate, feed conversion, and body composition, and two temperature regimens (thermoneutral and below the zone of thermoneutrality). Hemorrhage scores in thighs were dependent on rearing temperature, not on stock, and were highest in broilers reared at low temperatures. In all stocks, high scores in the thighs were accompanied by an increased carbon dioxide pressure and bicarbonate and triiodothyronine concentration of the venous blood, and by an increased relative heart weight, hematocrit, and blood loss at slaughter. Hemorrhage scores in breasts were dependent on stock, confounded with day of scoring. An effect of rearing temperature was present only for the leanest, slow-growing stock having the lowest feed conversion ratio at thermoneutral rearing conditions. Scores in breasts were related neither to body composition nor to metabolic and hemodynamic adaptations to low rearing temperatures. It is concluded that high hemorrhage scores in thighs are related to hemodynamic and metabolic adaptations to an increased need for energy and oxygen caused by low rearing temperatures. Hemorrhage scores are not related to stock-dependent differences...|$|R
