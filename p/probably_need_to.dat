There are also many records of collections of this species in mountainous areas of northern New South Wales, but these <b>probably</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be re-classified as B.neoanglica.|$|E
500|$|Douglas disregarded {{advice from}} party {{officials}} {{to wait until}} 1952 {{to run for the}} Senate, when Republican Senator Knowland would be up for reelection. Fundraising for the campaign was a concern from the beginning; Douglas friend and aide Ed Lybeck wrote her that she would <b>probably</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> raise $150,000 ($1.8 million today), which Douglas considered a massive sum.

2500|$|Aboriginal woman Karina Lester and Chief Executive Craig Wilkins of the Conservation Council of South Australia raised {{concerns}} that the submission process was unnecessarily complicated as written submissions were required to be signed by a Justice of the Peace. Lester and Wilkins argued {{that this would be}} particularly difficult for members of regional and remote communities. Lester also pointed out that the language of the Commission's presentations and issues papers made them difficult for aboriginal people to comprehend. Lester drew attention to her father, Yami Lester, who lost his sight after exposure to radioactive fallout from British nuclear weapons tests at Maralinga and Emu Field in the 1950s and 1960s. She told the ABC: [...] "My father (lives) 27 kilometres west form Marla Bore, (he) doesn't drive, wouldn't have a JP on hand, and would <b>probably</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> travel down to Coober Pedy... but he certainly has a story to tell and certainly would love to have input into the Royal Commission."The Royal Commission responded by agreeing to accept oral submissions in addition to formal written submissions.|$|E
50|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} using DNA (see Psittacula) {{showed that the}} Mauritius parakeet (Psittacula echo) {{is closely related to}} this species, and <b>probably</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be placed between the African and Asian subspecies. Consequently, this species is paraphyletic.|$|R
50|$|The routine use of cesarean {{section for}} early {{delivery}} of infants {{expected to have}} very low birth weight is controversial, and a decision concerning the route and time of delivery <b>probably</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be made {{on a case by}} case basis.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2016, Moore was {{mentioned}} as a possible candidate for chairman of the Republican National Committee.

2500|$|While {{the return}} to 2D had been met with high praise, the {{characters}} were modeled in 3D and then pre-rendered and saved in 2D sprites rather than being hand-drawn 2D sprites, which was initially met with mixed reception from fans. Cecil explained that the game was in full HD in order achieve the highest visual quality possible, but the original animations from The Shadow of the Templars and The Smoking Mirror were created in 640×400; a move to HD would require animations three times larger, and hand-animating so many pixels might be possible, but would be a [...] "massively complicated job." [...] To further quote Cecil, [...] "The massive advantage of rendering and then modelling is that obviously the data is much more manageable, we can connect animations much more smoothly, {{we can continue to}} tweak to optimise the 2D look which we’re in the process of doing, and you can hand-touch them at the end. A lot of people have said that we should be doing 2D, and I totally respect their comments, but my opinion is that it’s just not feasible. I’m also very pleased with the way the sprites are looking anyway. What we <b>probably</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> do is communicate that the end result is they look like they’re sprites, they look like they’re 2D. So I don’t regret the decision at all, and I’m absolutely convinced it’s the right one. I just don’t think we’ve communicated as well as we should have done that the end results will look like cartoony 2D sprites." [...] He also stated that 2D and 3D in HD brings the [...] "best of every world." [...] Technology written specifically to give the sprites a more [...] "cartoony" [...] look was written.|$|E

50|$|This species, Apoprogones hesperistis, is {{presumably the}} sister taxon of {{some or all}} South American Sematuridae but fresh {{collections}} are <b>probably</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> use a DNA sequencing approach to this question. The moth measures 4 cm. in wingspan and previously placed in the Castniidae (Shields and Dvorak, 1979) but it was recognised by A.J.T. Janse (Janse, 1932) as belonging to this family.|$|R
50|$|Fen {{pondweed}} {{is not in}} cultivation, {{and does}} not seem particularly easy to grow, reflecting its specialist habitat requirements. It would <b>probably</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be grown in a rather deep, peaty but alkaline substrate.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{only the}} bony {{structures}} and/or ligaments are damaged, {{resulting in various}} kinds of fractures (broken bones and discs or dislocations) and an unstable spine.

50|$|It {{was used}} {{as one of the}} water courses that filled the Stover Canal, when it was in use, along with the River Teign and River Bovey.

2500|$|Banana {{passion flower}} or [...] "banana poka" [...] (P. tarminiana), {{originally}} from Central Brazil, is an invasive weed, {{especially on the}} islands of Hawaii. It is commonly spread by feral pigs eating the fruits. It overgrows and smothers stands of endemic vegetation, mainly on roadsides. Blue passion flower (P. caerulea) is holding its own in Spain these days, and it <b>probably</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be watched so that unwanted spreading can be curtailed.|$|R

50|$|The Tasmanian genera Acalyphes and Dirce and {{possibly}} the South American Archiearides, traditionally placed in the subfamily Archiearinae, seem to be close relatives of the Australian nacophorines Niceteria and Paralaea and would <b>probably</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be moved to the present tribe.

30|$|Conclusion: Among the {{responders}} of this sample, calcemia measurement is frequent. Practices are heterogeneous. Total calcemia {{remains the}} most frequent method. One third of totCa results are not adjusted. Furthermore, robust data concerning the reliability of totCa adjustment are lacking in this specific population. Complementary studies are <b>probably</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> determine this latter aspect. Despite its widespread use, usfulness of routine calcium measurement is not warranted and may lead to misinterpretation of the concentration of calcium and hazardous diagnosis of dyscalcemia.|$|R
5000|$|The {{permanent}} teeth include supernumerary teeth. Unless these supernumeraries are removed they will crowd the adult teeth in what already {{may be an}} underdeveloped jaw. If so, the supernumeraries will <b>probably</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be removed to make space for the adult teeth. Up to 13 supernumarary teeth have been observed. Teeth may also be displaced. Cementum formation may be deficient.|$|E

5000|$|Rod Liddle, who was {{allegedly}} hit by Silverton in 2003, nevertheless defended his former co-presenter. Liddle said: [...] "Kate is intelligent, attractive and has strong opinions.

30|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{availability}} and the high cost to produce large-scale 225 Ac/ 213 Bi generators, preclinical studies with 213 Bi are often being performed using relatively low activity generators (e.g. 222  MBq 225 Ac). Under these conditions, the standard clinical labelling procedure for 213 Bi, which was designed for high activity generators (up to 4  GBq) with a reaction volume of 2  mL at[*]>[*] 0.7 Osmol.L− 1 (Kratochwil et al. 2014), <b>probably</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be adjusted.

50|$|The {{scale of}} {{corruption}} in Brazil is immense, but largely under-reported {{in the media and}} historically not investigated, prosecuted or punished, so it's difficult to estimate just how large the problem is. The Car Wash (Lava Jato) investigation may be changing this trend. Corruption in Brazil increases the already enormous Brazilian shadow economy which some sources estimate at 16.1% of the gross domestic product, a number that <b>probably</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be adjusted up considerably if corruption as such is included as part of the shadow economy.|$|R
