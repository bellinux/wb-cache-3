Samples were pressed to either 65 % or 73 % of crystal density from fine ({approx} 10 {mu}m grain size) and coarse (broad distribution of grain sizes peaking at {approx} 150 {mu}m) powders. Planar shocks of 0. 2 [...] 1 GPa were generated by impacting gas gun driven projectiles on plastic targets containing the HMX.

These are often a mixture of several ceramic materials, or metal matrix composites which combine ceramic compounds within a metal matrix.

Commercially produced or researched ceramics for such type of armour include boron carbide, silicon carbide, aluminium oxide (sapphire or [...] "alumina"), aluminium nitride, titanium boride and Syndite, a synthetic diamond composite. Of these boron carbide is the hardest and lightest, but also the most expensive and brittle.

40|$|Primary {{aluminium}} production is an energy intensive process, and the aluminiumindustry strives {{to lower the}} energy consumption. However, with the current technology a considerable reduction in the energy consumption is difficult to achieve. Implementation of an inert wettable drained cathode may reduce the energyconsumption for the process considerably. TiB 2 is the inert cathode material which has been considered the most promising and has received most attention. Although TiB 2 does not react with aluminium and has a low solubility in aluminium, limited lifetime during operation has been reported. TiB 2 cathodes have therefore not been introducedon an industrial scale. Degradation during operation is caused by penetration of aluminium along the grain boundaries, and {{has been attributed to}} the reaction between impurity phases in the material and aluminium. This work has focused on the effect ofoxide impurity phases on the microstructural evolution during the sintering process andthe effect of these impurities on the chemical and mechanical stability in an electrolysis cell environment. Moreover, the effect of sintering aids in the form of C, and C combined with Cr and B has also been investigated. The samples were hot pressed at temperatures between 1300 and 1900 °C at 50 MPa for 1 hour in Ar atmosphere. It was first shown that preferential orientation of the TiB 2 grains occurred during hot <b>pressing.</b> <b>Densities</b> around 93 % were achieved for TiB 2 without sintering additions at 1800 °C, and a TiO 1 -x C x solid solution was observed atthe grain boundaries. C was added in order to carbothermally reduce the oxideimpurities present in the TiB 2 powder during hot pressing. Reduction of the oxideimpurities by the addition of C resulted in an increase in the density above 97 %, and the amount of the secondary phase TiO 1 -x C x (ss) was considerably reduced. Excess Caddition relative to the amount necessary for carbothermal reduction of the oxideimpurities resulted in residual C and increased porosity in the materials, whereas toolow C addition resulted in residual TiO 1 -x C x (ss). A method to avoid residual C in the materials was developed. TiB 2 materials without oxide impurities or residual C can be achieved by reaction of the excess carbon with Crand B. It was demonstrated that the desired reactions removing residual oxides and excess carbon occurred, resulting in TiB 2 materials containing the secondary phases(Ti,Cr) C(ss), CrB and (Ti,Cr) B 2 (ss). The degradation resistance of the hot pressed TiB 2 and three commercially available materials was investigated by immersion in liquid aluminium and cryolitic melts, and/or by electrolytic deposition of aluminium on the sample surface. The degradation resistance was dependent on the secondary phases present along the grain boundariesand at triple junctions. Reduction of the mechanical strength and change in fracturemode from transgranular to intergranular was observed after immersion in liquid aluminium. Materials containing oxides or metallic phases along the grain boundaries suffered from severe degradation upon exposure towards liquid aluminium. The volume expansion associated with the reaction between the oxide impurities and aluminium resulted in severe cracking of the material. The metallic sintering aids dissolved readily in liquid aluminium resulting in rapid penetration of aluminium along the grain boundaries. Carbothermal reduction of the oxide impurities increased the degradation resistance in liquid aluminium. The degradation resistance for the materials with C, Cr and B additions was also investigated, and the degradation resistance was dependent on the carbide and boride secondary phases in the material. The materials containing (Ti,Cr) C(ss) and CrB suffered from severe cracking after exposure towards aluminium, and it was proposed that this is due to reactions between these secondary phases and aluminium upon formation of Al 4 C 3 and AlB 2. The(Ti,Cr) B 2 (ss) did, however, not react with aluminium, and the material with this phase along the grain boundaries showed an improved degradation resistance. All thematerials immersed in cryolitic melts suffered from penetration of cryolite along thegrain boundaries. No significant differences in degradation resistance were observedfor the materials with a relatively high amount of oxide impurities and the materials which were stable towards liquid aluminium. The mechanism for the unexpected rapid penetration of the fluoride melt in the materials is still to be investigated. After electrolytic deposition of aluminium, penetration of aluminum was observed at the surface of the materials which were shown to be stable in molten aluminium. This was attributed to the effect of the exposure and penetration of cryolitic melt before the deposition of aluminium occurred. PhD i materialteknologiPhD in Materials Technolog...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is the {{elaboration}} of the alumina zirconia composites, for orthopaedic application (femoral heads), through a colloidal method, which allows tailoring the size and distribution of zirconia grains. A {{first part of this}} work deals with the elaboration of the composite powder, obtained by surface modification of a commercial, submicrometer alumina powder. These powders were characterized in terms of phase evolution, thermal behaviour, kinetics and mechanism of the zirconia crystallization. The evolution and the kinetics of the zirconia crystallization were studied by conventional and high temperature X-Rays Diffraction. The crystallization mechanism was studied in detail, coupling the results of the kinetics investigations and the observations by Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM and HRTEM) of the powders treated at different temperatures. This study allowed the optimization of the thermal treatment, in order to preserve the homogeneity and the desired characteristics in the final microstructure. Composite powders, containing different zirconia amounts (between 5 and 20 vol. %), were prepared by this procedure. Some samples obtained by slip casting of the dispersed suspension were sintered and used for a preliminary characterization. Indentation tests were performed on the different samples, in order to evaluate the Vickers Hardness and the threshold for slow crack propagation, KI 0. The composite containing 10 vol. % ZrO 2 exhibited the maximum KI 0. The toughening is due to the t ®m transformation induced at the crack tip. The last part of this thesis deals with the elaboration of the femoral heads prototypes, by following a procedure compatible with the industrial strategy. The prototypes were obtained by isostatically pressing the spray dried powder. The green density was about 58. 2 % of the theoretical density (TD). After natural sintering, the mean density was 99. 3 % TD. Finally, after hot isostatic <b>pressing,</b> the <b>density</b> was close to the theoretical one. Hardness measurements were performed to evaluate the homogeneity of this property inside the ceramic spherical bodies. The hardness values obtained near the external surface and in the centre are comparable (~ 1956.

Moreover, the threshold for slow crack propagation, KI 0, was determined by Vickers indentation carried out along a diameter of a sample cross section. The mean KI 0 is 3. 8 +- 0. 3 MPa·m 1 / 2.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of pressing temperature on chemical modification of oil palm particles as raw material for particleboard manufacturing. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the properties of particleboard made from chemically modified oil palm biomass and to determine the effect of pressing temperature on the properties of the particleboard. Oil palm was used in this study due to the problem arose where abundance of oil palm were left at the site to be rotten when undergo replanting process. Therefore, this research was conducted in which to use the abundant of oil palm trunk to fulfill the need of wood-based panel in Malaysia. Samples of oil palm trunk were collected and grind into smaller particle before treated with glutaridialdehyde solution. The treated oil palm particle then inserted into the mould with dimension of 21 cm x 21 cm x 0. 5 cm to get uniform size of particleboard before undergo the process of hot pressing. The temperature was set at 130 °C, 140 °C and 150 °C for 10 minutes under pressure of 500 kgcm' 2 by using hot <b>pressing</b> machine. Physical (<b>density,</b> moisture content, water absorption and thickness swelling test) and mechanical (bending test) strength of the manufactured particleboard were test afterwards. Result showed that particleboard manufactured using 150 °C temperature with 0. 50. g/cm 3 density has the lowest percentage of thickness swelling which is 11. 74 % while the water absorption is 126. 73 %. Bending test for the manufactured particleboard using 150 °C has highest reading of modulus of rupture (MOR) with 3. 90 N/mm 2 and modulus of elasticity (MOE) of 626. 04 N/mm 2. From this study, it was discovered that higher temperature use to manufacture particleboard produce better result in mechanical and physical strength compared to lower temperature. Results of this study also suggest that the manufactured particleboard is suitable for decoration propose by the society...|$|R
