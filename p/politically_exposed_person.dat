40|$|<b>Politically</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> {{have become}} a {{specific}} risk factor in money laundering. The Financial Action Task Force has formulated clear and specific requirements for dealing with these individuals. Internationally, various jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and the European Union have adopted effective legislation encompassing the 2003 Financial Action Task Force Recommendations. In South Africa the requirement to apply appropriate, risk based procedures to <b>politically</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> has been limited to banks. The aim of this research {{study was to identify}} whether the South African anti-money laundering regulatory framework, adequately addresses managing the risks of <b>politically</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>persons.</b> The regulatory frameworks of the United Kingdom and the European Union, as well as the requirements of the Financial Action Task Force, were used to determine whether best practice is followed in South Africa with regard to <b>politically</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>persons.</b> The process of how money is laundered has been examined as well as the methods that corrupt <b>politically</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> use in order to launder money. The study has shown that <b>politically</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> are not regulated in South Africa in accordance with the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations issued in 2003, while the South African Anti-Money Laundering Regulatory Framework does not adequately address the risk posed by corrupt, <b>politically</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>persons.</b> Both international best practice and the recommendations of the World Bank were considered in terms {{of the way in which}} to address the risks posed by these persons effectively.

5000|$|In {{financial}} regulation, [...] "politically exposed person" [...] (PEP) {{is a term}} describing {{someone who}} has been entrusted with a prominent public function. A PEP generally presents a higher risk for potential involvement in bribery and corruption by virtue of their position and the influence that they may hold. The terms <b>politically</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>person</b> and senior foreign political figure are often used interchangeably, particularly in international forums. Foreign official is a term for individuals deemed as government persons under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or FCPA, and although definitions are similar to PEP, {{there are quite a few}} differences and should not be used interchangeably. The term PEP is typically used referring to customers in the financial services industry, while 'foreign official' refers to the risks of third party relationships in all industries.|$|E

50|$|It {{would be}} {{difficult}} to determine by such activity alone whether the particular act was related to terrorism or to organized crime. For this reason, these activities must be examined in context with other factors in order to determine a terrorism financing connection. Simple transactions can be found to be suspect and money laundering derived from terrorism will typically involve instances in which simple operations had been performed (retail foreign exchange operations, international transfer of funds) revealing links with other countries including FATF blacklisted countries. Some of the customers may have police records, particularly for trafficking in narcotics and weapons and may be linked with foreign terrorist groups. The funds may have moved through a state sponsor of terrorism or a country where there is a terrorism problem. A link with a <b>Politically</b> <b>Exposed</b> <b>Person</b> (PEP) may ultimately link up to a terrorism financing transaction. A charity may be a link in the transaction. Accounts (especially student) that only receive periodic deposits withdrawn via ATM over two months and are dormant at other periods could indicate that they are becoming active to prepare for an attack.|$|E

The author suggests that a criminal sanction and the opprobrium attached to it, in respect to political figures, does not have the same resonance in Africa as it does in Western jurisdictions. As a result, the rush for criminal indictment of officials by many AML agencies in Africa, regardless of the implausibility of the evidence masks a fundamental divergence of values in the way a criminal indictment is conceptualised across different jurisdictions...|$|R
40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{incidence}} and the prosecution of corruption in the Nigerian society with specific emphasis on plea bargaining which {{has been applied to}} prosecute some politicians (<b>Politically</b> <b>Exposed</b> <b>Persons)</b> and other people in the upper echelons of the Nigerian society, and that is gradually becoming widespread in criminal prosecution in Nigeria. The origin and merits of plea bargaining, as its protagonists argued, were analysed. The central focus here is a critique of corruption prosecution through plea bargain based on moral and utilitist principles. The study precisely advocated for outright dropping of the plea bargain in corruption prosecution in Nigeria because of its tendency to deepen and extenuate, rather than making mild and abating corruption in Nigeria. Given the patron-client character of power relation in the Nigerian state, the stipulations of anti-graft laws should be strictly followed in order not to make corruption prosecution constitute another source or facilitator of corruption in Nigeria...|$|R

Pronounced motives of profit in sport led to the appearance of new problems, like money laundering and business and moral unreliability of the participants.

40|$|The article first {{explains}} why the anti-money laundering (AML) regime in Hong Kong concerns cross-discipline and cross-jurisdiction issues. The author uses the recent money laundering scandal involving The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) members {{as an opportunity to}} assess the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations on <b>politically</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> (PEPs). The FIFA scandal involved financial institutions acting as intermediaries in facilitating the PEPs’ money laundering activities. Given financial institutions’ knowing or unknowing involvement in the scandal, there appears to be significant gaps in financial institutions’ ‘know your clients’ (KYC) due diligence process. The article warns that regulation on this issue is fragmented and inconsistent, as evidenced by how the risk-based approach recommended by the FATF is not observed in every jurisdiction. The article then examines the anti-money laundering regime in Hong Kong, one of the world’s main financial centres, by examining its various legislation and comparing them with the FATF Recommendations. Lastly, the article suggests improvements to Hong Kong’s AML legislation and the FATF Recommendations which are essentially a set of global AML standards. The article then explores ways to better implement the FATF Recommendations in jurisdictions that have adopted them, especially those which host the world’s financial centres...|$|R
