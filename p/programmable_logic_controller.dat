25|$|Information technology, {{together}} with industrial machinery and processes, {{can assist in}} the design, implementation, and monitoring of control systems. One example of an industrial control system is a <b>programmable</b> <b>logic</b> <b>controller</b> (PLC). PLCs are specialized hardened computers which are frequently used to synchronize the flow of inputs from (physical) sensors and events with the flow of outputs to actuators and events.|$|E
25|$|Stuxnet, {{discovered}} by Sergey Ulasen, initially spread via Microsoft Windows, and targeted Siemens industrial control systems. While {{it is not}} the first time that hackers have targeted industrial systems, nor the first publicly known intentional act of cyberwarfare to be implemented, it is the first discovered malware that spies on and subverts industrial systems, and the first to include a <b>programmable</b> <b>logic</b> <b>controller</b> (PLC) rootkit.|$|E
25|$|In {{a digital}} circuit, an FSM may be built using a {{programmable}} logic device, a <b>programmable</b> <b>logic</b> <b>controller,</b> logic gates and flip flops or relays. More specifically, a hardware implementation requires a register to store state variables, {{a block of}} combinational logic that determines the state transition, and a second block of combinational logic that determines the output of an FSM. One of the classic hardware implementations is the Richards controller.|$|E

25|$|Stuxnet is a {{computer}} worm discovered in June 2010 that {{is believed to have}} been created by the United States and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. It switched off safety devices, causing centrifuges to spin out of control. Stuxnet initially spreads via Microsoft Windows, and targets Siemens industrial control systems. While it is not the first time that hackers have targeted industrial systems, it is the first discovered malware that spies on and subverts industrial systems, and the first to include a <b>programmable</b> <b>logic</b> <b>controller</b> (PLC) rootkit.|$|E
