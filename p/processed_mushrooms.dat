Pre-treatment of biomass with single enzymes system is expensive and uneconomic and an alternative option has been tried. P. florida ``ready-to-fruit'' bags were sprinkled with biogas digester liquid (BDL) from a plug-flow reactor (PFR) type biogas plant fed with leaf litter. Spraying BDL not only increased the mushroom yields from 1. 6 to 2. 3 kg/kg substrate but also gave around similar to 85 ml of leachate rich in lignocellulolytic enzymes. Analysis of this enzyme cocktail at various stages of mushroom growth showed that on the 8 d a combination of lignocellulolytic enzymes rich in peroxidase (46. 67 U/gTS) and laccase (204. 38 U/gTS) and low in cellulase (8. 87 U/gTS) could be obtained {{which can be used}} for various industrial applications such as softening of biomass for higher biogas production and/or bioethanol production.

40|$|Consumption of {{mushrooms}} {{is as old}} as {{the human}} civilisation all over the world. The aroma is typical and special for each of the species of edible mushrooms. Despite their high consumption, only few studies were concerned with their aroma. This research aims at characterising the quality of the fresh and <b>processed</b> oriental <b>mushrooms</b> based on their aroma profile. As the volatile compounds (VC) are produced via metabolic and non-metabolic pathways, non-aggressive yet powerful techniques are needed to investigate their chemical composition. Ambient temperature vacuum distillation was successfully optimised to extract VC from fresh, boiled under reflux, dried at different temperatures (40, 50, 60, and 70 °C), and dried and boiled under reflux mushrooms. Four oriental mushroom species, Agrocybe aegerite, Flammulina velutipes, Pleurotus ostreatus, and Lentinus edodes were studied. VC were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using solid phase micro-extraction (SPME). A storage study of 10 days was conducted in order to detect changes in VC and hence deterioration in the different species. The C 8 compounds present in all the studied mushrooms were decreasing over time while aldehydes’ content was increasing. Furthermore, sulphur compounds in shiitake, contributing to the overall deterioration of the aroma of fresh mushrooms, were also increasing. The quality of dried materials depends on the physical and chemical changes occurring {{as a function of the}} processing conditions. Mushroom samples were dried at different temperatures to determine the most suitable one for aroma development where shiitake required 40 °C while chestnut needed 60 °C and enoki and oyster 50 °C. Some compounds such as furfuryl alcohol, 2 -undecanone and some conjugated dienal in chestnut and oyster, pyrazines in enoki, and lenthionine in shiitake mushrooms were only generated via heat. Rehydration temperature played an important role in the liberation of VC. In general the maximum release of alcohols, aldehydes, pyrazine and conjugated dienal from the dried material was higher at 100 °C rehydration temperature when compared to 25 °C. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the VC can be used as quality indicator and highlight the intensity of the <b>processes</b> in <b>mushrooms</b> in the course of processing and storage...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to assist the Government of Lesotho, and more particularly the Lesotho National Development Corporation (LNDC), in making a realistic assessment of the potential for growing mushrooms commercially in Lesotho. As mushroom cultivation would be new to Lesotho, specialised technical assistance was requested from FAO to advise on the general prospects for launching this industry in the country, and also to make a preliminary evaluation of an existing proposal for a joint venture project for Agaricus (button mushroom) production and processing. During the implementation of the project, an assessment was made of the outlook for developing Agaricus mushroom production for processing, with a view to utilising the facilities of the Basotho Fruit and Vegetable Canners more efficiently. This assessment was based on a study of the availability and cost of production and management inputs (many of which would have to be imported or acquired), as well as a detailed design of a mushroom farm to enable the calculation of unit production costs under prevailing local conditions and a profitability comparison of different methods of mushroom processing for export. The full analysis showed that, whilst intensive Agaricus mushroom growing and processing in Lesotho is technically possible, investment in such an undertaking would carry the risk of not being commercially feasible, considering the estimated cost and selling price levels, along with current conditions of saturation on the international market. It was therefore recommended that LNDC give due consideration to the analysis of projected production costs and the current situation on the international market for <b>processed</b> Agaricus <b>mushrooms,</b> when reviewing the existing joint venture proposal for a establishing a commercial mushroom production and processing plant in Lesotho. Certain factors contributing to the estimated cost disadvantage for Lesotho vis--vis other established producers are likely to remain constant, while others could change in time. Should there be an improvement in international markets for <b>processed</b> button <b>mushrooms,</b> coupled with a cheap and steady local supply of cereal straw and/or chicken manure for compost making become available, intensive production of Agaricus mushroom could be reconsidered.

Shiitake keeps better and is less susceptible to temperature, humidity and disease than Agaricus and there is an increasing European market for both the fresh and dried product. Wheat straw and chicken manure are not used in the cultivation of Shiitake and the essential raw materials, such as sawdust and corncobs, may also be more cheaply and readily available locally. The outlook for Shiitake growing in Lesotho - from the market and economic point of view - may be somewhat more favourable, and may merit further investigation.

These are designed to use the hydraulic pressure of muscle tissue to expand the bullet. The hollow point peels back into eight or nine connected pieces causing it to expand the damaged area. The hollow point fills with body water on impact, then expands as the bullet continues to have water pushed into it. This <b>process</b> is called <b>mushrooming,</b> as the ideal result is a shape that resembles a mushroom - a cylindrical base, topped with a wide surface where {{the tip of the}} bullet has peeled back to expose more area to create more drag while traveling through a body. A copper-plated hollowpoint loaded in a [...]44 Magnum, for example, with an original weight of 240 grains (15.55 g) and a diameter of 0.43 inch (11 mm) might mushroom on impact to form a rough circle with a diameter of 0.70 inch (18 mm) and a final weight of 239 grains (15.48 g).|$|R

The dryer was configured for harvesting maximum rate of solar radiation by having a longer drying period. The three axial flow fans provide the air inlet which can accelerate the drying rate. An electrical backup was also used for continuous drying process. Final moisture content and cabinet temperature (CT) were recorded and compared to the open sun drying and oven drying <b>process.</b> White oyster <b>mushroom</b> was dried at 50 degrees C to 60 degrees C and the desired moisture content of 7. 97 has been achieved without affecting the product color. Activation energy, product output rate (POR), evaporation rate have been calculated. Shrinkage of drying mushroom was analyzed at different temperatures. The important climatic variables such as solar radiation, temperature and relative humidity are the main factors that affect the drying rate constant (k). Final output indicates {{that the quality of}} dried product in solar powered air dryer was competitive with the branded products available in the market. This drying system can be used {{for a wide range of}} agricultural products...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityVitamin D {{has proven}} to be an {{important}} factor in health through a plethora of studies. Tachysterol is a photoproduct of previtamin D with sun or ultraviolet radiation exposure. While vitamin D is well known for its importance in bone health, the biologic function of tachysterol is unknown. Many vertebrates and fungi can produce vitamin D from a precursor after UV irradiation or sun exposure, including white button mushrooms. This project aims to determine if tachysterol might have a biologic function in white button mushrooms by determining if the disappearance of tachysterol 2 was due to some active <b>process</b> in live <b>mushrooms.</b> To provide evidence that tachysterol serves a function, tachysterol 2 disappearance in white button mushrooms was monitored after 24 hours. The aim was to create conditions in a white button mushroom, including freezing and microwaving them to determine their effects on tachysterol 2 disappearance at 24 hours. The idea was that freezing or microwaving the mushroom would disrupt any metabolic <b>process</b> in the <b>mushroom,</b> providing a clue as to the mechanism of tachysterol 2 disappearance. The hypothesis was that freezing and microwaving the white button mushroom would cause a reduction in tachysterol 2 disappearance. To evaluate this, 1) white button mushrooms were irradiated with ultraviolet radiation (UVB, 290 nm- 320 nm), 2) an irradiated white button mushroom was frozen, and 3) an irradiated white button mushroom was microwaved. These white button mushrooms were biopsied in triplicate, extracted, and run on high-performance liquid chromatography {{in order to determine the}} concentrations of tachysterol 2 in the mushrooms. A white button mushroom without UVB irradiation was biopsied in triplicate and extracted to confirm that the store-bought mushrooms did not contain tachysterol 2. A tachysterol 2 standard was incubated in organic solvent to determine if tachysterol 2 was stable. The results showed statistically significant decrease in tachysterol 2 for the irradiated mushroom, the frozen irradiated mushroom, the microwaved mushroom 24 hours after irradiation, compared to the standard tachysterol 2 in organic solvent. The decrease in tachysterol 2 in the microwaved mushroom was 65 % in 24 hours, which was not significantly less than in the irradiated mushroom and the frozen irradiated mushroom (p= 0. 10 and 0. 22, respectively). The decrease in tachysterol 2 for the frozen mushroom was 93 %, which was not significantly less than the irradiated mushroom (p = 0. 21). These findings suggest that microwaving a mushroom at 5 mW and 60 seconds and freezing a mushroom does not significantly interfere with metabolic processes that may involve tachysterol 2, although microwaving a mushroom trended towards less of a decrease in the tachysterol concentration...|$|R
40|$|Precise {{control of}} {{cellular}} morphology {{is critical for}} both the development and maintenance of nervous systems. In the developing Drosophila eye, normal photoreceptor cells establish and maintain a highly polarized architecture, with cell bodies and nuclei located apically in the epithelium, and axons extending basally into the brain. Disruption of the Dynactin complex, which activates the minus-end-directed microtubule motor protein Dynein, causes mislocalization of photoreceptor nuclei basally, even into the optic stalk and brain. Photoreceptors in animals mutant for the Dynactin subunit Glued retain apical markers, but have a bipolar-like morphology with the cell body translocated toward the brain and an apical process extending {{to the surface of}} the eye disc. Dynactin is required post-mitotically to maintain proper nuclear positioning. Using a genetic screen, I identified loss-of-function alleles of kinesin heavy chain, encoding a subunit of the plus-end-directed microtubule motor Kinesin, as suppressors of the rough eye and nuclear mispositioning in Glued mutants. Thus, a balance of minus-end-directed and plus-end-directed microtubule motor forces may be required to maintain nuclear position within postmitotic neurons. (cont.) Establishment and maintenance of complex axonal trajectories is also a key feature of neuronal mophology. I identified a requirement for a novel cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase, PTPMEG, in these <b>processes.</b> Normal <b>mushroom</b> bodies, structures critical for insect learning and memory, have dorsally-projecting alpha lobe and medially-projecting beta lobe axons. Alpha lobes develop normally in ptpmeg mutants, but their pattern is not maintained. Instead, alpha lobe axons retract during pupation, resulting in thin and/or shortened alpha lobes. Meanwhile, beta lobe axons overextend at the midline. Removing ptpmeg function in mushroom bodies does not cause mutant phenotypes. ptpmeg mutants are rescued by pan-neuronal expression of wild-type Ptpmeg, but not by versions with disrupted phosphatase activity. These data suggest that Ptpmeg activity is required in another type of neuron to prevent mushroom body axon retraction. Ellipsoid body axons normally form a ring structure in the central brain. In ptpmeg mutants, the ellipsoid body axons develop abnormally, with the ventral side of the ring being discontinuous; the defect can be rescued by expression of wild-type Ptpmeg pan-neuronally. by Jessica LaMae Whited.

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{results of the}} study made in 2014 on evaluation of the content of Cs- 137 in different homemade dried and pickled mushrooms picked by residents of most contaminated areas of the Bryansk region. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate actual content levels of Cs- 137 in homemade preserves of dried and pickled mushrooms picked in the Bryansk region areas with high level of radioactive contamination after Chernobyl accident. Sampling was conducted in residential settlements in proximity to most visited forest areas located at different distances to residential settlements in the range from 0. 3 to 5 kilometers, with different forest types, with different soil surface contamination density by Cs- 137 in the range from 33 to 944 kBq/m 2 (Tentative levels of surface contamination of forest soil are evaluated based on the results of gammaspectrometry measurements in soil samples). The sampling was done at voluntary consent of local residents. In the frameworks of the research in ten settlements with 6112 residents altogether 25 samples were selected (8 samples of dried and 17 of pickled mushrooms). The analyses of study results resulted in the following conclusions: specific activity in samples of different kinds of dry and pickled mushrooms picked by residents of south-west areas of the Bryansk region vary in broad range from 32 to 34000 Bq/kg. The most part of homemade preserves of dried and pickled mushrooms of the local residents exceeds normative levels of permissible mushroom contamination. Cs- 137 content in pickled mushrooms is not explicitly dependent on the level of soil surface contamination whereas specific activity of dry mushrooms increases along with the level of surface contamination increase. In the <b>process</b> of <b>mushroom</b> pickling, the additional reduction of Cs- 137 content is observed: from 17 % to 67 % which averages to 37 %. Due to the gradual reduction of transfer coefficients for Cs- 137 into forest mushrooms and significant contribution of mushroom consumption into internal radiation dose as well as due to a wide scatter of transfer coefficients of the radionuclide into different kinds of mushrooms, the robust forecasting of the expected levels of population exposure requires further study of dynamics of time-dependent changes of the transfer coefficient. </p...|$|R
