2500|$|The mid-1950s saw the Australian Army {{deployed}} {{to a number}} of theatres in Southeast Asia in response to the threat of Communism and as a result the Jungle Training Centre was re-raised in 1954. At that time the centre's facilities were expanded to over [...] and its subunits consisted of an officer and NCO training unit, a collective pre-deployment training unit and a doctrine wing. Colonel Ted Serong took over command of the centre in 1955 and instructors included officers who had gained considerable experience during World War II; these included Lieutenant Colonel George Warfe, who had commanded a commando company and infantry battalion during the war and who was appointed to the role of Chief Instructor. Major Bernard O'Dowd, who had served in Korea, took over as Senior Instructor. Using the skills of these men, the units of the Royal Australian Regiment were prepared for tours of Malaya and Borneo. The first unit to receive training was the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, which cycled through Canungra in company lots starting in early 1955. In 1960, the centre's remit was expanded to include the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> on promotion courses for officers of all corps in the Army. In 1964, the centre came under the command of Colonel Stuart Clarence Graham. Following the commitment of Australian personnel to South Vietnam, the centre ramped up its training program as 10,000 soldiers were rotated through Canungra each year as part of the pre-deployment training each battalion had to complete before undertaking its tour of duty. As a part of this, on 4 January 1966, a demonstration platoon was raised at Canungra. It was later redesignated as HQ 1st Division Defence Company. Training during this time consisted of three weeks of physical and mental hardening through a battery of obstacle courses and battle inoculation ranges.|$|E
