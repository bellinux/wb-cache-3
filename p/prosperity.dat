5|$|In the 1960s, <b>prosperity</b> {{became a}} primary focus in healing revivals. T. L. Osborn began {{emphasizing}} <b>prosperity</b> in the 1960s and became {{known for his}} often ostentatious displays of personal wealth. During that decade, Roberts and William Branham criticized other <b>prosperity</b> ministries, arguing that their fund-raising tactics unfairly pressured attendees. These tactics were prompted {{in part by the}} expense of developing nationwide radio networks and campaign schedules. At the same time, leaders of the Pentecostal Assemblies of God denomination often criticized the focus on <b>prosperity</b> taken by independent healing evangelists.|$|E
5|$|Most {{churches in}} the <b>prosperity</b> {{movement}} are non-denominational and independent, though some groups have formed networks. <b>Prosperity</b> churches typically reject Presbyterian polity (or governance) {{and the idea that}} a pastor should be accountable to elders; it is common for pastors of <b>prosperity</b> churches to be the highest organizational authority figure. Critics, including Sarah Posner and Joe Conason, maintain that <b>prosperity</b> teachers cultivate authoritarian organizations. They argue that leaders attempt to control the lives of adherents by claiming divinely bestowed authority. Jenkins contends that <b>prosperity</b> theology is used as a tool to justify the high salaries of pastors.|$|E

5|$|<b>Prosperity</b> {{theology}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the <b>prosperity</b> gospel, the health and wealth gospel, or the gospel of success) is a religious belief among some Christians, who hold that financial blessing and physical well-being are always the will of God for them, and that faith, positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase one's material wealth. <b>Prosperity</b> theology views the Bible as a contract between God and humans: if humans have faith in God, he will deliver security and <b>prosperity.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Prosperity</b> {{theology}} {{teaches that}} Christians {{are entitled to}} well-being and, because physical and spiritual realities are seen as one inseparable reality, this is interpreted as physical health and economic <b>prosperity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wealth is {{interpreted}} in <b>prosperity</b> theology as a blessing from God, obtained through a spiritual law of positive confession, visualization, and donations. This process is often taught in almost mechanical terms; Kenneth Copeland, an American author and televangelist, argues that <b>prosperity</b> {{is governed by}} laws, while other teachers portray the process formulaically. Journalists David van Biema and Jeff Chu of Time have described Word of Faith pastor Creflo Dollar's teachings about <b>prosperity</b> as an inviolable contract between God and humanity.|$|E

A 2006 poll by Time reported that 17 percent of Christians in America said they identified with the movement. There is no official governing body for the movement, though many ministries are unofficially linked.|$|E
5|$|Coleman has {{speculated that}} modern-day <b>prosperity</b> {{theology}} borrows heavily from the New Thought movement, though {{he admits that}} the connection is sometimes unclear. Jenkins notes that critics draw a parallel between <b>prosperity</b> theology and the cargo cult phenomenon. While citing the popularity of <b>prosperity</b> theology in agrarian African communities, he argues that it can also bear similarities to traditional African religious rituals. J. Matthew Wilson of Southern Methodist University compares the movement to Black theology owing to its focus on uplifting oppressed groups, though he notes that it differs in its concentration on individual success rather than corporate political change.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, public {{attention}} in the United States was drawn to <b>prosperity</b> theology through the influence of prominent televangelists such as Jim Bakker. Bakker's influence waned, however, after he was implicated in a high-profile scandal. In the aftermath, Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) emerged as the dominant force in <b>prosperity</b> televangelism, having brought Robert Tilton and Benny Hinn to prominence.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s, churches {{teaching}} <b>prosperity</b> theology saw significant {{growth in}} the Third World. According to Philip Jenkins of Pennsylvania State University, poor citizens of impoverished countries often find the doctrine appealing because of their economic powerlessness and the doctrine's emphasis on miracles. One region seeing explosive growth is Western Africa, particularly Nigeria. In the Philippines, the El Shaddai movement, part of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal, has spread <b>prosperity</b> theology outside Protestant Christianity. One South Korean <b>prosperity</b> church, Yoido Full Gospel Church, gained attention in the 1990s by claiming to be the world's largest congregation.|$|E
5|$|Teachers of the {{doctrine}} focus on personal empowerment, promoting a positive view of the spirit and body. They maintain that Christians have been given power over creation because they {{are made in the}} image of God and teach that positive confession allows Christians to exercise dominion over their souls and material objects around them. Leaders of the movement view the atonement as providing for the alleviation of sickness, poverty, and spiritual corruption; poverty and illness are cast as curses which can be broken by faith and righteous actions. There are, however, some <b>prosperity</b> churches which seek a more moderate or reformed paradigm of <b>prosperity.</b> Kirbyjon Caldwell, pastor of a Methodist mega-church, supports a theology of abundant life, teaching <b>prosperity</b> for the whole human being, which he sees as a path to combating poverty.|$|E

5|$|The Neo-Pentecostal {{movement}} has been characterized in part by an emphasis on <b>prosperity</b> theology, which gained greater acceptance within charismatic Christianity during the late 1990s. By 2006, {{three of the four}} largest congregations in the United States were teaching <b>prosperity</b> theology, and Joel Osteen has been credited with spreading it outside of the Pentecostal and Charismatic movement through his books, which have sold over 4 million copies. Bruce Wilkinson's The Prayer of Jabez also sold millions of copies and invited readers to seek <b>prosperity.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>prosperity</b> {{theology}} {{teaching of}} positive confession stems from its proponents' view of scripture. The Bible {{is seen as}} a faith contract between God and believers; God is understood to be faithful and just, so believers must fulfill their end of the contract to receive God's promises. This leads to a belief in positive confession, the doctrine that believers may claim whatever they desire from God, simply by speaking it. <b>Prosperity</b> theology teaches that the Bible has promised <b>prosperity</b> for believers, so positive confession means that believers are speaking in faith what God has already spoken about them. Positive confession is practiced to bring about what is already believed in; faith itself is a confession, and speaking it brings it into reality.|$|E
5|$|After the Danish Reformation, {{involving}} {{the suppression of}} the Catholic bishopric in 1536, the city enjoyed a sustained period of <b>prosperity</b> from the 1530s to the mid-17th century, becoming northern Funen's commercial centre. One of the main sources of income was the sale of cattle, providing substantial funds for the construction of fine half-timbered houses for the local merchants. The local nobility also participated in the city's development by building residences where they spent the winter months. But the city's <b>prosperity</b> came to an abrupt end in the late 1650s heavy taxes were imposed {{after the end of the}} Swedish Wars.

5|$|Although by {{the close}} of the 1860s, Denver {{residents}} could look with pride at their success establishing a vibrant supply and service center, the decision to route the nation's first transcontinental railroad through Cheyenne, rather than Denver, threatened the <b>prosperity</b> of the young town. A daunting 100 miles away, citizens mobilized to build a railroad to connect Denver to the transcontinental railroad. Spearheaded by visionary leaders including Territorial Governor John Evans, David Moffat, and Walter Cheesman, fundraising began. Within three days, $300,000 had been raised, and citizens were optimistic. Fundraising stalled before enough was raised, forcing these visionary leaders {{to take control of the}} debt-ridden railroad. Despite challenges, on June 24, 1870, citizens cheered as the Denver Pacific completed the link to the transcontinental railroad, ushering in a new age of <b>prosperity</b> for Denver.|$|E
