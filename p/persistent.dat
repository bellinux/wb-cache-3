5|$|A <b>persistent</b> thyroglossal duct is {{the most}} common {{clinically}} significant congenital disorder of the thyroid gland. A <b>persistent</b> sinus tract may remain as a vestigial remnant of the tubular development of the thyroid gland. Parts of this tube may be obliterated, leaving small segments to form thyroglossal cysts. Preterm neonates are at risk of hypothyroidism as their thyroid glands are insufficiently developed to meet their postnatal needs. In order to detect hypothyroidism in newborn babies, to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life, many countries have newborn screening programs at birth.|$|E

5|$|Antidepressants may be {{effective}} for treating chronic pain associated with symptoms of depression, {{but they have}} a risk of side effects. Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic low back pain and may relieve sciatic pain, there is insufficient evidence to support their use. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back pain. Facet joint injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to {{be effective}} in those with <b>persistent,</b> non-radiating pain; however, they may be considered for those with <b>persistent</b> sciatic pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement in those with sciatica but are of no long term benefit. There are also concerns of potential side effects.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} passed south of Bermuda on September23, it produced heavy waves, {{as well as}} gale force winds for 17hours. Naval Air Station Bermuda reported peak gusts of 75mph (120km/h). There was no reported damage, and {{the hurricane}}'s passage failed to alleviate <b>persistent</b> drought conditions.|$|E
5|$|Based on an August 2 diary entry {{describing}} {{heavy rainfall}} and gusty northeasterly winds at Fort George Island, {{a tropical storm}} {{is believed to have}} made landfall just south of there. In southeastern Georgia, the storm negatively affected the cotton crop that was already suffering from <b>persistent</b> drought conditions.|$|E
5|$|Bovista pila {{is found}} in corrals, stables, roadsides, {{pastures}} and open woods. The puffballs fruit singly, scattered, or in groups on the ground. It is also known to grow in lawns and parks. The puffball spore cases are <b>persistent</b> and may overwinter. Fruiting occurs throughout the mushroom season.|$|E
5|$|Eruptions from Mount Cleveland are {{generally}} vulcanian and strombolian in nature, characterized by short explosive ash clouds sometimes accompanied by a'a flows, lava fountains, pyroclastic flows, ash and steam emissions, lava dome growth, and the ejection of breadcrust bombs. Hot springs were reportedly {{found on the}} volcano in the 1800s, and <b>persistent</b> fumarolic activity was observed in the 1980s and 1990s. Mount Cleveland is a site of <b>persistent</b> steam emissions and thermal anomalies that represent constant background activity. During 2011, a summit lava dome formed, by continuous intrusion of magma at the summit. Late in 2011, nearly 6 explosions demolished the dome. In June 2012, another small dome was observed.|$|E

5|$|In late October, the ITCZ {{developed}} a <b>persistent</b> area of convection {{west of the}} Indonesian island of Sumatra. A tropical low formed on October28 within the Australian region, which initially failed to develop much due to <b>persistent</b> wind shear. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) named the system Melanie on October31 {{to the north of}} the Cocos Islands. The newly upgraded storm tracked generally westward due to a ridge to the south, and entered the south-west Indian Ocean on November1 as a strong tropical storm. At that time, Melanie was renamed Bellamine. After the ridged moved farther away, the storm turned more to the southwest and began quickly intensifying. Early on November3, Bellamine attained tropical cyclone status, and the next day reached peak 10minute winds of 175km/h (110mph); this made it an intense tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|In midsummer the strigs {{of green}} fruit ripen to edible berries, very dark purple in colour, almost black, with glossy skins and <b>persistent</b> calyxes at the apex, each {{containing}} many seeds. An established bush can produce about 4.5 kilograms (10 pounds) of fruit each year.|$|E
5|$|In neuroscience, {{long-term}} potentiation (LTP) is a <b>persistent</b> strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity. These are patterns of synaptic activity that produce a long-lasting increase in signal transmission between two neurons. The opposite of LTP is long-term depression, which produces a long-lasting decrease in synaptic strength.|$|E
5|$|June 4, 1968– Tropical Storm Abby moves ashore near Punta Gorda, {{spawning}} 3 small tornadoes {{and producing}} up to 14.2inches (361mm) of precipitation at Cocoa. The rainfall is beneficial and ends a severe, <b>persistent</b> drought in the state. The storm causes six indirect {{deaths in the}} state.|$|E

5|$|<b>Persistent</b> genital arousal {{disorder}} (PGAD) {{results in}} a spontaneous, <b>persistent,</b> and uncontrollable genital arousal in women, with or without orgasm, unrelated to any feelings of sexual desire. Clitoral priapism, also known as clitorism, is a rare, potentially painful medical condition and is sometimes described as an aspect of PGAD, in which the erect clitoris does not return to its relaxed state for an unusually {{extended period of time}} (ranging from minutes to days), despite the absence of both physical and psychological stimulation; PGAD can also be associated with morphometric and vascular modifications of the clitoris.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that nonpathogenic strains of H. pylori may be beneficial, e.g., by normalizing stomach acid secretion, and {{may play a role}} in regulating appetite, since its presence in the stomach results in a <b>persistent</b> but reversible reduction in the level of ghrelin.|$|E

5|$|The {{meteorological}} {{history of}} Hurricane Gordon {{consisted of a}} thirteen-day {{period in which the}} storm's path was erratic, <b>persistent,</b> and highly unusual. The hurricane formed near Panama in the southwestern Caribbean on November 9, 1994. As a tropical depression it brushed Nicaragua and spent several days in the waters off the country's coast. Strengthening slightly into a tropical storm, Gordon wound its way north into the Greater Antilles. Despite warm waters, <b>persistent</b> wind shear prevented significant strengthening. Executing a slow turn to the north and then the northwest, Gordon made two more landfalls, on eastern Jamaica and eastern Cuba, while delivering tremendous rains to western Hispaniola.|$|E
