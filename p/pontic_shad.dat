5000|$|The river has rich {{flora and}} fauna. There {{are more than}} 30 species of {{freshwater}} fishes, such as Flathead grey mullet, European chub, Common carp, <b>Pontic</b> <b>shad,</b> Romanian barbel, European bitterling, Common rudd, etc.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Pontic</b> <b>shad</b> (Alosa immaculata, {{previously}} Alosa pontica), {{also referred}} to as the Black Sea shad or Kerch shad, is a species of clupeid fish in the genus Alosa, native to the Black Sea and Sea of Azov basins.|$|E
50|$|Fishing is an {{economic}} mainstay {{in parts of the}} East of Romania and along the Black Sea coast, with important fish markets in places such as Constanta, Galati and Tulcea. Fish such as european anchovy, sprat, <b>pontic</b> <b>shad,</b> mullet, goby, whiting, garfish, Black-Sea Turbot or horse mackerel are landed at ports such as Constanta.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{a total of}} 31 {{specimens}} of <b>pontic</b> <b>shad,</b> Alosa immaculata Bennet, 1835 (Pisces: Clupaeidae) caught in the Black Sea coasts near Sinop, Turkey in 2010 were investigated for their parasite fauna. Four parasite species were identified: Mazocraes alosae (Herman, 1782), Pronoprymna ventricosa (Rudolphi, 1891), Lecithaster confusus Odhner, 1905 and Hysterothylacium aduncum (Rudolphi, 1802). H. aduncum was the core species with infection prevalence of 96. 7 % and mean intensity value of 97. 1 ? 18. 1 parasites per infected fish, followed by M. alosae (61. 3 % and 3. 2 ? 0. 5), P. ventricosa (35. 5 % and ? 12. 5) and L. confusus (29 % and 8. 2 ? 2. 8), respectively. In the present study, Mazocraes alosae, Pronoprymna ventricosa and Lecithaster confusus are reported from <b>pontic</b> <b>shad</b> off Turkish coasts of the Black Sea for the first time...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{presenting}} some aspects regarding the structure of  fish communities from 22 Km of predeltaic sector of Danube River, between {{the mouth of}} Siret River (km 155) and Prut River (Mm 72. 5). The aim {{of the study is}} to assess the ecological status of the area, using some analytical and synthetic ecological indices, but also diversity and equitability indices. From April to December 2012, in four fishing areas (km 150 - 151, Mm 77 - 78, Mm 76 - 77, Mm 74 - 74. 5), 7121 fish of 31 species, from 7 famillies and 6 orders, were collected. The best represented family is Cyprinidae with 17 species. The numerical abundance ranged between 1 fish/species (zingel, Danube streber and Black Sea trout - rare species) and 2035 fish/specie (<b>pontic</b> <b>shad</b> - abundant specie). The <b>pontic</b> <b>shad</b> (43. 98 %), common bream (12. 09 %) and Prussian carp (10. 66 %) are eudominant species, having the biggest potential in fish productivity...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Pontic</b> <b>shad</b> {{lives in}} the northwestern part of the Black Sea. It migrates in the Danube River for spawning. The larvae drift passively towards the sea when they reach the life stage ranging from pre-larvae to post-larvae. During the larval stage the <b>Pontic</b> <b>shad</b> is floating, mainly in the 0 - 50 cm upper layer of river. Upstream of the Danube Delta, in the {{straight}} sector of the river, alosids are distributed mostly towards {{the middle of the}} river, where the water velocity is higher. In the curved section of the river, upstream of the location of the Danube River splitting in the delta’s branches, the water current is outwardly pushing the shad larvae to the right shore, the Romanian, respectively. Therefore, Tulcea branch (Romanian) takes over 60 - 80 % from the total of Danubian larvae, even its water flow is smaller (40 %) than Chilia branch (the border of Romania and Ukraine). The distribution of larvae at the splitting point influences the repartition of adult migratory catch, at return for spawning, between Saint George branch (Romania) and Chilia branch. Consequently, the topography and hydrology of the river at the splitting point of the branceh which form the delta decide on the distribution of larvae, and later, when the shads are homing on the same way for spawning the sharing catch between Romania and Ukraine...|$|E
40|$|Specimens of <b>Pontic</b> <b>shad</b> (Alosa pontica Eichwald, 1838) were {{collected}} during April and May of 2006 in the Danube River (rkm 863) just downstream of the Iron Gate (Djerdap) II dam. Twenty-eight scales and 30 vertebrae were prepared {{and given to}} five interpreters with fish aging experience of from 3 to 30 years and with shad aging experience of from 0 to 12 years. Interpreters with experience in shad age determination showed lower values for the index of average percent error (IAPE) and an index of coefficient of variation (ICV). In regard to within-interpreter reproducibility, {{no significant differences were}} found between scale and vertebrae as structure for age determination. The most experienced reader showed the lowest value for IAPE, while the least experienced reader showed the highest value for IAPE. The results of this work indicate that experience in age determination by particular structure had more impact on age determination precision than specificity of structure, scale or vertebra. More work is needed on adopting standard protocols that must include some sort of common interaction between responsible age readers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The first impassable {{obstacles}} for {{the fish}} migration along the River Danube from the Black Sea are represented by the Iron Gates I and II hydroelectrical dams, constructed in 1972 and 1984 on 943 and 863 river kilometers, respectively. Construction of fish passages on these dams would make more than 800 river kilometers upstream reopened for fish migrations. The Iron Gates dams are jointly operated by Romania and Serbia and they represent the largest hydropower dam and reservoir system along the Danube River basin. Among migratory fish species affected by these dams are three critically endangered sturgeon species and <b>Pontic</b> <b>shad</b> (Alosa immaculata) as anadromous species, catadromous European eel (Anguilla anguilla) and more than 10 potamodromous fish species. Differences in time of upstream and downstream migrations {{have to be taken}} into account while considering the provision for free passage through the dams, as well as total lengths of upstream migrants, especially of species such as beluga sturgeon (Huso huso) that can reach total length of more than 3 m. Preliminary fish passage feasibility study could involve investigation of local hydraulic conditions at different discharges and operating conditions of dams, as well as investigation of fish behavior when they approach dams during migrations by fish tracking, telemetry, and Didson or Aris camera. Romania and Serbia could develop research teams for continual monitoring of fish behavior in the vicinity of dams, as well as in the reservoir between the two dams, based on the best experiences from other countries. Common work of biologists, ecologists, hydrologists and civil engineers is necessary regarding data collection, review of existing data, as well as for evaluation of the fish passage alternatives. Involvement of governmental agencies, local authorities, hydropower managers, researchers and NGO 2 ̆ 7 s from both countries is one of the prerequisites for successful completion of fish passages...|$|E
