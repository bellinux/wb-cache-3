Here again, just {{as in the case of}} schooling, we have to raise the {{neglected}} problem--neglected so far as education goes--of economy of effort; and we have to look once more at the new facilities that our educational institutions have so far refused to utilize. Our European colleges and universities have a long and honourable tradition that again owes much to the educational methods of the Roman Empire and the Hellenic world. This tradition was already highly developed before the days of <b>printing</b> <b>from</b> <b>movable</b> <b>type,</b> and long before the days when maps or illustrations were printed. The higher education, therefore, was still, as it was in the Stone Age, largely vocal. And the absence of paper and so forth, rendering notebooks costly and rare, made a large amount of memorizing necessary. For that reason the mediæval university teacher was always dividing his subject into firstly and secondly and fourthly and sixthly and so on, so that the student could afterwards tick off and reproduce the points on his fingers--a sort of thumb and finger method of thought--still to be found in perfection in the discourses of that eminent Catholic apologist, Mr. Hilaire Belloc. It is a method that destroys all sense of proportion between the headings; main considerations and secondary and tertiary points get all catalogued off as equivalent numbers, but it was a mnemonic necessity of those vanished days.|$|E

Quick to see the commercial advantages of the new invention, Caxton moved his printing press to London, near Westminster Abbey, where he brought out in 1477 his Dictes and Sayinges of the Philosophers, the first book ever printed on English soil.

Like <b>printing</b> <b>from</b> <b>movable</b> <b>type,</b> electronic digital communication offers significant advantages over previous technologies, and it has taken hold and spread very rapidly. As the twentieth century draws to a close, more and more records are being created, stored, and disseminated in digital form. A growing number of analog records are being converted to digital form so they can be incorporated into computer-based systems. But just as no one in the fifteenth century fully grasped the implications of the printing revolution, the implications of the computer revolution social, cultural, economic, and intellectual remain largely unclear to us. Especially unclear are the implications for long-term access to digitally encoded information. Issues concerning the preservation and survival of records in digital form have attracted little attention. How long will various forms of digital media last? What steps must be taken to ensure the survival of the information they contain? We have little experience or substantive knowledge to guide policy decisions concerning the preservation of computer-based and computer-generated records, but the implications of what is known are troubling. Many digital storage media have short life expectancies; moreover, retrieval of their information content is dependent on specific software and hardware that may have even shorter life expectancies.

He flourished by focusing on Flemish works, rather than Italian, as they were very popular throughout Europe during the Renaissance music era. His printing shop used the triple-impression method, in which a sheet of paper was pressed three times. The first impression was the staff lines, the second the words, and the third the notes. This method produced very clean and readable results, although it was time-consuming and expensive.|$|R

40|$|The first {{books in}} the world <b>printed</b> <b>from</b> <b>movable</b> metal <b>type,</b> whose European {{appearance}} is credited to Johannes Gutenberg in about 1450, are today relatively rare and valuable, either because of their intrinsic or extrinsic characteristics.

Printed books are sometimes regarded almost like a museum object, appreciated for their beauty alone. The research aims to show that these books are the heritage of libraries but also of museums. Through literature related to historic houses museums the case of the Plantin-Moretus Museum, created in 1555, will be portrayed. Plantin-Moretus, founded as a public institution in the nineteenth century, is generally regarded as the most important museum of European typography in the world. Several rooms have been preserved exactly {{as they were in the}} seventeenth century, including presses dating from 1600, and the museum houses archival documentation unmatched worldwide. In this piece I also take up the question, among others, of authenticity versus representation in historical museum exhibitions. In the history of business or manufacturing, one typically finds a representation of the past rather than its preservation. Old factories get torn down and their machines and other contents destroyed. But thanks to the practices of the Plantin-Moretus family and the commitment of the city of Antwerp, we have in this museum actual continuity from the past, with unchanged space. In this universe, a patrimony of rare books is in an ideal home, not in a library, as might be expected, but in a museum context where the objects remain in the same location in which they were born...|$|R

2500|$|Electrotyping {{was also}} used to produce entire <b>printing</b> plates {{directly}} <b>from</b> the formes composed <b>from</b> <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> and illustrations. In this application, electrotyping was a higher quality but more costly alternative to stereotyping, which involved casting of type metal into a mold prepared from the forme. Stereotyping had been invented around 1725, and was already well-established when electrotyping was invented in 1838. Both methods yielded plates that could be preserved in case of future needs, for example in the printing of novels and other books of unpredictable popularity. The <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> used to compose the original forme could then be re-used. Both methods {{could be used to}} prepared curved plates for rotary presses, which were used for the longest print runs. The widespread adoption of electrotyping for this use occurred after mechanical electrical generators (dynamos) became commonly available around 1872. These generators supplanted the whole rooms of chemical batteries (Smee cells) that were previously used to provide electricity for electrotyping. Batteries did not have the electrical capacity needed to rapidly deposit the electrotype (or [...] "electro"). The advent of plating dynamos sped up electrotyping twenty times or more, so that an electrotype printing plate could be deposited in less than two hours. In addition, the chemical batteries gave off toxic fumes that had required their isolation in separate rooms.|$|R

This includes the printing of sixty-six copies of a 5,020 volume long encyclopedia in 1725, the Gujin Tushu Jicheng (Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times), which necessitated the crafting of 250,000 <b>movable</b> <b>type</b> characters cast in bronze.
