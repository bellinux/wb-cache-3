5|$|Pelicans {{give their}} {{name to the}} <b>Pelecaniformes,</b> an order which has a varied taxonomic history. Tropicbirds, darters, cormorants, gannets, boobies and frigatebirds, all {{traditional}} members of the order, have since been reclassified: tropicbirds into their own order, Phaethontiformes, and the remainder into Suliformes. In their place, herons, ibises, spoonbills, the hamerkop and the shoebill have now been transferred into <b>Pelecaniformes.</b> Molecular {{evidence suggests that the}} shoebill and the hamerkop form a sister group to the pelicans, though there is some doubt as to the exact relationships among the three lineages.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{studies have}} {{consistently}} shown that pelicans, the namesake {{family of the}} <b>Pelecaniformes,</b> are actually {{more closely related to}} herons, ibises and spoonbills, the hamerkop and the shoebill than to the remaining species. In recognition of this, the order comprising the frigatebirds and Suloidea was renamed Suliformes in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Cormorants are medium-to-large aquatic birds, {{usually with}} mainly dark plumage {{and areas of}} {{coloured}} skin on the face. The bill is long, thin and sharply hooked. Their feet are four-toed and webbed, a distinguishing feature among the <b>Pelecaniformes</b> order. Four species occur in Tasmania, with a fifth as a vagrant.|$|E
5|$|Long {{thought to}} be related to frigatebirds, cormorants, tropicbirds, gannets and boobies, {{pelicans}} instead are now known to be most closely related to the shoebill and hamerkop, and are placed in the order <b>Pelecaniformes.</b> Ibises, spoonbills, herons and the desolate bitterns have been classified in the same order. Fossil evidence of pelicans dates back to at least 30 million years to the remains of a beak very similar to that of modern species recovered from Oligocene strata in France. They are thought to have evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas; this is reflected in the relationships within the genus as the eight species divide into Old World and New World lineages.|$|E
5|$|While Hesperornis is {{not thought}} to have left descendants, the {{earliest}} modern seabirds also occurred in the Cretaceous, with a species called Tytthostonyx glauconiticus, which seems allied to the Procellariiformes and <b>Pelecaniformes.</b> In the Paleogene the seas were dominated by early Procellariidae, giant penguins and two extinct families, the Pelagornithidae and the Plotopteridae (a group of large seabirds that looked like the penguins). Modern genera began their wide radiation in the Miocene, although the genus Puffinus (which includes today's Manx shearwater and sooty shearwater) might {{date back to the}} Oligocene. The highest diversity of seabirds apparently existed during the Late Miocene and the Pliocene. At the end of the latter, the oceanic food web had undergone a period of upheaval due to extinction of considerable numbers of marine species; subsequently, the spread of marine mammals seems to have prevented seabirds from reaching their erstwhile diversity.|$|E

500|$|In 1874, English {{zoologist}} Alfred Henry Garrod {{published a}} study {{where he had}} examined various groups of birds and recorded which muscles of a selected group of five [...] they possessed or lacked. Noting that the muscle patterns were different among the steganopodes (classical <b>Pelecaniformes),</b> he resolved that there were divergent lineages in the group that should be in separate families, including frigatebirds in their own family Fregatidae. Urless N.

The classification of this group as the traditional <b>Pelecaniformes,</b> united by feet that are totipalmate (with all four toes linked by webbing) and the presence of a gular pouch, persisted until the early 1990s. The DNA–DNA hybridization studies of Charles Sibley and Jon Edward Ahlquist placed the frigatebirds in a lineage with penguins, loons, petrels and albatrosses. Subsequent genetic studies place the frigatebirds as a sister group to the group Suloidea, which comprises the gannets and boobies, cormorants and darters. Microscopic analysis of eggshell structure by Konstantin Mikhailov in 1995 found that the eggshells of frigatebirds resembled those of other <b>Pelecaniformes</b> in having a covering of thick microglobular material over the crystalline shells.|$|E

500|$|There exists {{no single}} {{definition}} of which groups, families and species are seabirds, and most definitions {{are in some}} way arbitrary.

[...] However, by convention all of the Sphenisciformes and Procellariiformes, all of the <b>Pelecaniformes</b> except the darters, {{and some of the}} Charadriiformes (the skuas, gulls, terns, auks and skimmers) are classified as seabirds. The phalaropes are usually included as well, since although they are waders ("shorebirds" [...] in North America), two of the three species are oceanic for nine months of the year, crossing the equator to feed pelagically.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cormorants}} are a group {{traditionally placed}} within the <b>Pelecaniformes</b> or, in the Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy, the expanded Ciconiiformes. This latter group {{is certainly not}} a natural one, and even after the tropicbirds have been recognised as quite distinct, the remaining <b>Pelecaniformes</b> seem not to be entirely monophyletic. Their relationships and delimitation – apart from {{being part of a}} [...] "higher waterfowl" [...] clade which is similar but not identical to Sibley and Ahlquist's [...] "pan-Ciconiiformes" [...] – remain mostly unresolved. Notwithstanding, all evidence agrees that the cormorants and shags are closer to the darters and Sulidae (gannets and boobies), and perhaps the pelicans or even penguins, than to all other living birds.|$|E
2500|$|Nothing {{is known}} for sure about the {{colouration}} of these birds, as they have not left living descendants. But some inferences can be made based on their phylogeny: {{if they were a}} member of the [...] "higher waterbird" [...] group (see below), they most probably had a plumage similar to that depicted in the reconstruction of Osteodontornis orri – Procellariiformes and <b>Pelecaniformes</b> in the modern sense (or Ciconiiformes, if <b>Pelecaniformes</b> are merged there) have hardly any carotenoid or structural colors at all in their plumage, and generally lack even phaeomelanins. Thus, the only colours commonly found in these birds are black, white and various shades of grey. Some have patches of iridescent feathers, or brownish or reddish hues, but these are rare and limited in extent, and those species in which they are found (e.g. bitterns, ibises or the hammerkop) are generally only found in freshwater habitat.|$|E
2500|$|The {{systematics}} of bony-toothed {{birds are}} subject of considerable debate. Initially, they were {{allied with the}} (then-paraphyletic) [...] "Pelecaniformes" [...] (pelicans and presumed allies, such as gannets and frigatebirds) and the Procellariiformes (tube-nosed seabirds like albatrosses and petrels), because of their similar general anatomy. Some of the first remains of the massive Dasornis were mistaken for a ratite's and later a diatryma's. They were even used to argue for a close relationship between these two groups – and indeed, the pelicans and tubenoses, {{as well as for}} example the other [...] "Pelecaniformes" [...] (cormorants and allies) which are preferably separated as Phalacrocoraciformes nowadays, the Ciconiiformes (storks and/or either herons and ibises or the [...] "core" [...] <b>Pelecaniformes)</b> and Gaviiformes (loons/divers) seem to make up a radiation, possibly a clade, of [...] "higher waterbirds". However, the Pelagornithidae are not generally held to be a missing link between pelicans and albatrosses anymore, but if anything much closer to the former and only convergent to the latter in ecomorphology.|$|E
2500|$|As their {{relationships}} are still unresolved between Galloanserae and [...] "higher waterbirds", the pseudotooth birds are here {{placed in the}} distinct order Odontopterygiformes as a compromise, {{rather than in a}} pelecaniform/ciconiiform or anseriform suborder Odontopterygia or even a family of the Anseriformes, Ciconiiformes or <b>Pelecaniformes.</b> Such a treatment is unlikely to be completely wrong in either case, as the pseudotooth birds are well distinct from the Presbyornithidae and Scopidae, today generally regarded as the very basal divergences of, respectively, the Anseriformes and the pelican-stork group. It also provides leeway should the proposed separation of the Pelagornithidae into several families turn out to be appropriate. It is perhaps notable that when Boris Spulski established the Odontopterygia in 1910, he did this partly because he noted some of the similarities between pseudotooth birds and waterfowl listed above. Dasornis was long mistaken for a diatryma (Gastornithiformes), now strongly suspected to be very close indeed to the Anseriformes. Also, the pelagornithid Palaeochenoides mioceanus was initially mistaken for an anseriform, and the same might hold true for the supposed Oligocene swan Guguschia nailiae. In the former case, however, a [...] "much the more convincing" [...] analysis for a placement outside the Galloanseres was published the year after its description already. Most unrecognised pelagornithid bones were initially assigned to [...] "higher waterbird" [...] families however, typically to the (then-paraphyletic) [...] "Pelecaniformes", but in particular the tarsometatarsus was typically mistaken for that of a procellariiform. The Odontopterygiformes were first proposed when Osteodontornis was described from the first – and still the only known – reasonably complete skeleton of one of these birds. Hildegarde Howard found that, no matter that some of its features resembled other birds, the combination was quite unlike any neognath known.|$|E
50|$|Of the {{families}} in <b>Pelecaniformes,</b> only Pelecanidae, Balaenicipitidae, and Scopidae remain. The tropicbird family Phaethontidae has since been moved to their own order Phaethontiformes. Genetic analysis seems {{to show that the}} <b>Pelecaniformes</b> is actually closely related to the Ardeidae and Threskiornithidae. As for the Suliformes, they are distantly related to the current <b>Pelecaniformes.</b> According to Hackett et al. (2008), loons, penguins, storks, and as well as Suliformes and <b>Pelecaniformes,</b> all seem to have evolved from a common ancestor. The proposed waterbird superorder has been suggested.|$|E
