40|$|BACKGROUND: The axial {{skeleton}} of extinct saurischian dinosaurs (i. e., theropods, sauropodomorphs), like living birds, was pneumatized by epithelial outpocketings of the respiratory system. Pneumatic signatures in the vertebral column of fossil saurischians include complex branching chambers within the bone (internal pneumaticity) and large chambers visible externally that are bounded by neural arch laminae (external pneumaticity). Although general aspects of internal pneumaticity are synapomorphic for saurischian subgroups, the individual internal pneumatic spaces cannot be homologized across species or even along the vertebral column, {{due to their}} variability and absence of topographical landmarks. External <b>pneumatic</b> <b>structures,</b> in contrast, are defined by ready topological landmarks (vertebral laminae), but no consistent nomenclatural system exists. This deficiency has fostered confusion and limited their use as character data in phylogenetic analysis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present a simple system for naming external neural arch fossae that parallels the one developed for the vertebral laminae that bound them. The nomenclatural system identifies fossae by pointing to reference landmarks (e. g., neural spine, centrum, costal articulations, zygapophyses). We standardize the naming process by creating tripartite names from "primary landmarks," which form the zygodiapophyseal table, "secondary landmarks," which orient with respect to that table, and "tertiary landmarks," which further delineate a given fossa. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed nomenclatural system for lamina-bounded fossae adds clarity to descriptions of complex vertebrae and allows these structures to be sourced as character data for phylogenetic analyses. These anatomical terms denote potentially homologous <b>pneumatic</b> <b>structures</b> within Saurischia, but they {{could be applied to}} any vertebrate with vertebral laminae that enclose spaces, regardless of their developmental origin or phylogenetic distribution...|$|R

50|$|Membrane {{structures}} are spatial structures {{made out of}} tensioned membranes.

The other major building on the site, built for the 2008 Summer Olympics, is the Beijing National Aquatics Center, also known as the Water Cube.

40|$|Membrane {{structures}} play {{an important}} role in a wide variety of applications, ranging from solar sails, satellites and aircraft, to <b>pneumatic</b> <b>structures,</b> lightweight temporary constructions and biological tissues. In this research project a numerical model has been developed for stress analysis in isotropic elastic membranes undergoing finite deformations, while partly or totally subjected to pressure loading of the hydrostatic type. The possibility of wrinkling is accounted for by employing a Relaxed Strain Energy Density. The numerical procedure is based on the Dynamic Relaxation Method. This is an explicit, iterative technique in which the static solution is obtained as the steady state part of the damped dynamic response of the structure. The numerical scheme is constructed by applying Green's theorem differencing method for the spatial discretization of the partial differential equations describing the damped motion of the membrane. The resulting system of ordinary differential equations is further integrated in time by a central difference time integrator. Solutions of typical boundary value problems are obtained and analyzed. The effects of various loading and boundary conditions on the response of the membrane are examined. The predictions of the numerical method are in good agreement with the results obtained with experimental models...|$|R

Allosaurus hatchlings seem to have been one-seventh or less of the adult length and are thus comparable in relative size to hatchlings of large extant crocodile species, but are unlike the relatively larger hatchlings in coelurosaurs. The snout experienced considerable positive allometry and an increase in tooth count during early development. The element is especially noteworthy for the abundant and well-developed features associated with the paranasal <b>pneumatic</b> system. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>structures</b> present include all those found in adult allosaurids and most are even more developed than in adult skulls. Together with evidence on the ontogeny of the tympanic pneumatic system in allosaurids, these findings demonstrate that cranial pneumaticity developed early in theropod ontogeny.

40|$|The pre-sacral {{vertebrae}} of most sauropod dinosaurs {{were surrounded}} by interconnected, air-filled diverticula, penetrating into the bones and creating an intricate internal cavity system within the vertebrae. Computational finite-element models of two sauropod cervical vertebrae now demonstrate the mechanical reason for vertebral pneumaticity. The analyses show that {{the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae leads to an even distribution of all occurring stress fields along the vertebrae, concentrated mainly on their external surface and the vertebral laminae. The regions between vertebral laminae and the interior part of the vertebral body including thin bony struts and septa are mostly unloaded and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>structures</b> are positioned in these regions of minimal stress. The morphology of sauropod cervical vertebrae was influenced by strongly segmented axial neck muscles, which require only small attachment areas on each vertebra, and pneumatic epithelia that are able to resorb bone that is not mechanically loaded. The interaction of these soft tissues with the bony tissue of the vertebrae produced lightweight, air-filled vertebrae in which most stresses were borne by the external cortical bone. Cervical pneumaticity was therefore an important prerequisite for neck enlargement in sauropods. Thus, we expect that vertebral pneumaticity {{in other parts of the}} body to have a similar role in enabling gigantism...|$|R
