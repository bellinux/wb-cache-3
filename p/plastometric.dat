It should be emphasized that bainite transformation is the key reaction to enrich non-transformed austenite with carbon. This study {{was carried out in}} order to gain understanding of the effect of thermomechanical hot rolling on final microstructure and mechanical properties of C-Mn-Si TRIP steel.

The special prepared stepped specimens were rolled on laboratory tandem mill. The effects of finish rolling temperature, strain and isothermal bainite transformation temperature on mechanical properties of mentioned TRIP steel were evaluated (mechanical properties were examined with tension test). Major deformation, higher finishing rolling temperature and higher temperature of bainite hold result in drop in strength.

In {{order to}} improve mechanical, {{frictional}} or biocompatibility behavior of well know materials like titanium (Ti) or titanium nitride (TiN) scientists are trying to develop new manufacturing and processing operations. One of those methods, that provide interesting results, is called deposition process. During deposition a material is upgraded with new surface layers that are characterized by specific required properties. These layers have usually different mechanical properties in comparison with a substrate material. A combination of different properties of the deposited layers can significantly change behavior of the structure under an exploitation condition. However, layers have usually nanometer scale, which causes problems with performing standard <b>plastometric</b> tests.
