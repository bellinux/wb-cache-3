5|$|In March 2013, a CRA {{poll showed}} that the Progressive Conservatives had fallen below the NDP, with 39 per cent {{indicating}} they supported the New Democrats and 38 per cent supporting the PC Party. The Liberal Party were third with 22 per cent support. Michael also surpassed Dunderdale when asked who would make the best premier, Michael was at 33 per cent and Dunderdale was at 32 per cent. This {{was also the first}} poll to show that more people were dissatisfied with government's performance then satisfied. An Angus Reid <b>poll</b> <b>released</b> on April 8, 2013, rating the performance of provincial premiers, showed that Dunderdale was the most unpopular premier in the country.

5|$|A CRA <b>poll</b> <b>released</b> in March 2010 showed {{public support}} for Williams' Progressive Conservative Party that had {{extended}} to a record 80 percent of decided voters, up from 77 percent from February.

After controversies arose surrounding the accidental expropriation of the Grand Falls-Windsor paper mill and the province's readiness to react to a possible oil spill, the Williams led government {{as well as his}} personal popularity took a slight hit. A CRA poll conducted in May 2010, showed that satisfaction with the government was at 87 percent down from 93 percent in March, the party's support had fallen five percent to 75 percent and Williams own support fell to 79 percent down from 81 percent. Even with the slight loss in support Williams remains by far the most popular provincial or federal leader in the country.|$|E
5|$|During her premiership {{support for}} Dunderdale, her {{government}} and the PC Party saw a steady decline. A Corporate Research Associates (CRA) <b>poll</b> <b>released</b> days after Dunderdale became premier, and conducted before she took office, showed that 90 per cent of the population {{were satisfied with the}} PC government. 75 per cent would vote for the Progressive Conservative Party in an election and 76 percent chose Williams as the best leader to be premier. A CRA poll conducted throughout February 2011, showed that support for Dunderdale, her {{government and the}} PC Party remained high. Satisfaction with government was at 82 per cent, while 73 per cent of respondents said they would vote for the PC Party in an election. 64 per cent of respondents stated Dunderdale was the best choice for premier, compared to 18 per cent for Liberal leader Yvonne Jones and 5 per cent for Lorraine Michael. An Angus Reid Public Opinion (Angus Reid) poll conducted around the same time listed Dunderdale as the second most popular premier in Canada with a 55 percent approval rating. 10 percent of respondents disapproved of her performance while 35 percent were not sure if they approved or disapproved of her performance.|$|E

5|$|Two {{additional}} polls, {{released in}} late April and mid-May by Keystone Analytics, showed Peduto regaining {{the lead in}} the primary race. In the April poll, Peduto's lead was within the plus or minus 4.38 percent margin of error; he led Jack Wagner 38 to 36 percent. Jake Wheatley received 5 percent support and A. J. Richardson received less than 1 percent. A <b>poll</b> <b>released</b> in mid-May, with a plus or minus 4.9 percent margin of error, suggested that Peduto had expanded his lead over Wagner. Peduto was supported by 39 percent of respondents, while Wagner had 36 percent. Wheatley and Richardson garnered 8 and 1 percent, respectively. An additional poll, commissioned by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review and conducted by Susquehanna Polling & Research and released in the final week before the primary, also showed Peduto leading Wagner, 42 to 33 percent. The same poll showed Wheatley with 6 percent and Richardson with 1 percent.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the provincial {{election}} was called in September 2011, support for Dunderdale, her government and the Progressive Conservatives had fallen in public opinion polls. However, her party entered the campaign with support levels in the high fifties and Dunderdale remained the top choice for premier. On October 11, 2011, Dunderdale led her party to victory winning 56 per cent of the popular vote, which was consistent with polling throughout the campaign. After an initial bounce in the polls following the election, support for Dunderdale would decline right up until her resignation as premier in 2014. Throughout 2012, Dunderdale saw her personal numbers take a big hit, while PC Party support and government satisfaction would also decline. In November 2012, 36 per cent of respondents to a CRA poll thought Dunderdale was {{the best choice for}} premier, down from 59 per cent a year earlier. Although the Progressive Conservatives still remained in first place their support had fallen 14 points over the year to 46 per cent. While government satisfaction had fallen it remained high, with 58 percent of respondents either being completely or mostly satisfied. An Angus Reid <b>poll</b> <b>released</b> in December 2012, also showed declining support for Dunderdale over the year. Just 37 per cent of those polled approved of the job Dunderdale was doing as premier, while 55 per cent disapproved.|$|E
