40|$|A {{sustainable}} energy system can {{be treated as a}} development of the distributed generation concept. It meets energy demands locally from renewable energy or/and high-efficiency <b>polygeneration</b> production technologies, and is characterized by energy and cost efficiency, reliability, and environmental-friendliness. Distributed energy systems typically use renewable energy resources to supply all energy demands, such as heat, cooling, and electric power in an integrated way. However, it seems that too much emphasis is placed on power and associated renewable energy-based power technologies for dealing with sustainability issues in public discussion and the research community. Often, equally important thermal energy (heat and cooling) and <b>polygeneration</b> are ignored. <b>Polygeneration</b> is an energy- efficient technology for generating simultaneously heat and power as well as other energy products in a single integrated process. Energy efficiency contributes significantly to CO 2 emission reduction. This paper discusses the role of <b>polygeneration</b> in a distributed energy system and the contributions of <b>polygeneration</b> to the development of {{sustainable energy}} systems.

40|$|In {{order to}} reach targets on {{reducing}} greenhouse gas emissions from fossil resources {{it is necessary to}} reduce energy losses in production processes. In <b>polygeneration,</b> several processes are combined to complement each other to avoid sub-optimization of the standalone processes. This thesis addresses <b>polygeneration</b> with focus on Combined Heat and Power (CHP) production integrated with other processes. Biomass-fired CHP plants are commonly dimensioned to have surplus heat production capacity during periods with lower heat demand. At the same time, production of biomass based vehicle fuels and fuel upgrading are heat demanding processes. The opportunity to combine CHP with ethanol production from lignocellulosic feedstock and torrefaction with the aim of replacing fossil fuels are used as cases during the evaluation of <b>polygeneration.</b> Simulation models are used to investigate the performance of CHP integrated with production of ethanol and torrefaction. Measured data from commercial CHP plants have been used to reflect the operation boundaries. The findings show that <b>polygeneration</b> can compete with stand-alone production in both energy and economic performance. <b>Polygeneration</b> offers a wider operating range where reduced minimum load gives increased annual operating time. Therefore, under limited heat demand more renewable electricity production is possible due to increased operating hours and steam extraction from the turbine during part-load operation. Resource availability and fluctuations in fuel price have the largest impact on the profit of <b>polygeneration.</b> Other aspects that have substantial effects on the economy in <b>polygeneration</b> are the electricity spot price and subsidies. Furthermore, it has been proven that the yield of each product in a multiproduct process plant, the size of the plant and the heat demand have a large impact on the economy. <b>Polygeneration</b> turns by-products into buy-products...|$|E

Consequently, there is increase in small scale <b>polygeneration</b> systems fuelled by natural gas. In this paper, {{attention is paid to}} a test facility, located in Southern Italy, to carry out experimental analysis on a small scale <b>polygeneration</b> system based on a natural gas-fired Micro-CHP and a desiccant HVAC system.

40|$|<b>Polygeneration</b> is {{a concept}} where {{multiple}} energy products are generated in a single plant by tightly integrating multiple processes into one system. Compared to conventional single-product systems, <b>polygeneration</b> systems have many economic advantages, such as potentially high profitability and high viability when exposed to market fluctuations. The optimal design of an energy <b>polygeneration</b> system that converts coal and biomass to electricity, liquid fuels (naphtha and diesel) and chemical products (methanol) with carbon dioxide (CO²) capture under different economic scenarios is investigated. In this system, syngas is produced by gasification of coal and/or biomass; purified by a cleaning process to remove particles, mercury, sulfur and CO²; and then split to different downstream sections such as the gas turbine, FT process and the methanol process. In this thesis, the optimal design with the highest net present value (NPV) is determined by optimizing equipment capacities, stream flow rates and stream split fractions. The case study results for static <b>polygeneration</b> systems reveal that the optimal design of <b>polygeneration</b> systems is strongly influenced by economic conditions such as feedstock prices, product prices, and potential emissions penalties for CO². Over the range of economic scenarios considered, it can be optimal to produce a mixture of electricity, liquid fuels, and methanol; only one each; or mixtures in-between. The optimal biomass/coal feed ratio significantly increases when the carbon tax increases or the biomass price decreases. An economic analysis of the optimal static <b>polygeneration</b> designs yielded a slightly higher NPV than comparable single-product plants. The flexible operation is then considered for the energy <b>polygeneration</b> system. In real applications, product prices can fluctuate significantly seasonally or even daily. The profitability of the <b>polygeneration</b> system can potentially be increased if some operational flexibility is introduced, such as adjusting the product mix in response to changing market prices. The major challenge of this flexible design is {{the determination of the}} optimal trade-off between flexibility and capital cost because higher flexibility typically implies both higher product revenues and larger equipment sizes. A two-stage optimization formulation for is used for the optimal design and operation of flexible energy <b>polygeneration</b> systems, which simultaneously optimizes design decision variables (e. g., equipment sizes) and operational decision variables (e. g., production rate schedules) in several different market scenarios to achieve the best expected economic performance. Case study results for flexible <b>polygeneration</b> systems show that for most of market scenarios, flexible <b>polygeneration</b> systems achieved higher expected NPVs than static <b>polygeneration</b> systems. Furthermore, even higher expected NPVs could be obtained with increases in flexibility. The flexible <b>polygeneration</b> optimization problem is a potentially large-scale nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) and cannot be solved to global optimality by state-of-the-art global optimization solvers, such as BARON, within a reasonable time. The nonconvex generalized Benders decomposition (NGBD) method can exploit the special structure of this mathematical programming problem and enable faster solution. In this method, the nonconvex MINLP is relaxed into a convex lower bounding problem which can be further reformulated into a relaxed master problem according to the principles of projection, dualization and relaxation. The relaxed master problem yields an nondecreasing sequence of lower bounds for the original problem. And an nonincreasing sequence of upper bounds is obtained by solving primal problems, which are generated by fixing the integer variables in the original problem. A global optimal objective is obtained when the lower and upper bounds coincide. The decomposition algorithm guarantees to find an E-optimal solution in a finite number of iterations. In this thesis, several enhanced decomposition methods with improved relaxed master problems are developed, including enhanced NGBD with primal dual information (NGBD-D), piecewise convex relaxation (NGBD-PCR) and lift-and-project cuts (NGBD-LAP). In NGBD-D, additional dual information is introduced into the relaxed master problem by solving the relaxed dual of primal problem. The soobtained primal dual cuts can significantly improve the convergence rate of the algorithm. In NGBD-PCR, the piecewise McCormick relaxation technique is integrated into the NGBD algorithm to reduce the gap between the original problem and its convex relaxation. The domains of variables in bilinear functions can be uniformly partitioned before solution or dynamically partitioned in the algorithm by using the intermediate solution information. In NGBD-LAP, lift-and-project cuts are employed for solving the piecewise lower bounding problem. In all three enhanced decomposition algorithms, there is a trade-off between tighter relaxations and more solution times for subproblems. The computational advantages of the enhanced decomposition methods are demonstrated via case studies on the flexible <b>polygeneration</b> problems. The computational results show that, while NGBD can solve problems that are intractable for a state-ofthe- art global optimization solver (BARON), the enhanced NGBD algorithms help to reduce the solution time by up to an order of magnitude compared to NGBD. And enhanced NGBD algorithms solved the large-scale nonconvex MINLPs to [epsilon]-optimality in practical times (e. g., a problem with 70 binary variables and 44136 continuous variables was solved within 19 hours). by Yang Chen.

40|$|The thesis work {{deal with}} <b>polygeneration,</b> the {{combined}} production {{of more than}} one energy vectors from a single primary energy source, in residential and tertiary sectors. In particular the thesis focuses on micro or small <b>polygeneration</b> systems that are placed immediately at the consumer's site. This concept, often referred as distributed <b>polygeneration,</b> differs from the dominant architecture of the current electricity system based on large scale centralized power generation. Compared to the separate production, <b>polygeneration</b> leads to primary energy saving and greenhouse gas benefits. However, in order to ensure a high market penetration of these promising technologies in residential and tertiary sector, it is essential to deal with some issues, such as the high investment payback period and the potential negative effects on the electricity network related to a large diffusion of distributed generation. In order to overcome this issues different possible solution were investigated by means dynamic simulations. One interesting solution could be the load sharing approach, which consists in the introduction of a small electric and thermal micro-grid allowing the sharing of electric, thermal and cooling loads among a group of diversified end users. By sharing the load among different types of final users (residential, commercial, institutional, etc.) it is possible to increase the operating hours of the MCHP system. Moreover the introduction of an energy service company that manages a large number of systems distributed on the territory, often referred as virtual power plant, could obtain some advantages related to the managing of a high number of polygenerator system. Others possible solutions analyzed in this thesis are related to the increasing share of self-consumed electricity "produced" by the MCHP system. In this way it is possible to reduce the potential impact related to the large diffusion of distributed <b>polygeneration</b> systems and improve the economic performance of the MCHP. In order to increase the share of self-consumed electricity two different strategies are analyzed. The first consists in the careful selection of the user in which the MCHP system is installed, while the second relies on the interaction between the MCHP system and the electric vehicles charging. Another interesting solution analyzed in this thesis refers to the introduction of hybrid energy system that combine two or more energy conversion devices, that when integrated, overcome limitations inherent in either. Finally the use of Urban Energy Maps to locate an urban area suitable for the introduction of a <b>polygeneration</b> system is investigated. The methodology was applied to the historical centre of Benevento in order to design a <b>polygeneration</b> system and a district heating and cooling network able to meet the energy requirements of a cluster of users. The findings of this thesis confirmed the energy and environmental advantages related to the diffusion of distributed <b>polygeneration</b> systems. In addition to these advantages, already shown in scientific literature, this work identified different solutions in order to overcome the main disadvantages of this promising technology.

The new <b>polygeneration</b> system can achieve the optimal ratio of H 2 to CO for methanol production by adjusting input ratio {{of natural gas}} to biomass without any energy penalty. Thus, the suggested system can eliminate CO to H 2 shift process and CO 2 remove process, which can avoid material and energy destruction; however, those processes are otherwise necessary in individual biomass to methanol plant. Moreover, the new system eliminates the CO 2 addition process; however, the addition of CO 2 is necessary in individual natural gas to methanol plant, which causes extra energy penalty. This system combined chemical production and power generation together, {{in order to achieve}} the cascaded utilization of chemical and physical energy of natural gas and biomass. In a further way, we investigated the key processes, to maximize the utilization of energy and improve system performance. A thermo-chemical process taking biomass and natural gas as co-feedstock is compared with the systems that only taking either biomass or natural gas as resource for methanol production and power generation. The evaluation and calculation of the systems are carried out by help of Aspen Plus process simulator. The evaluation results indicate that, the new <b>polygeneration</b> system can reduce materials input at least 9 % compared with individual systems with same output. In a further way, the effect of natural gas to biomass feed ratio on system performance is also investigated. The research results show that, the proposed <b>polygeneration</b> system would be expected to realize efficient utilization of biomass and natural gas, and offer a possibility of developing new technologies for biomass and natural gas based systems.

40|$|During {{the last}} years, special {{attention}} has been paid to renewable <b>polygeneration</b> technologies, able of simultaneously producing thermal, cooling, electrical energy and desalinated water from seawater. This paper focuses on an innovative <b>polygeneration</b> system driven by renewable energy sources, including the following technologies: hybrid photovoltaic/thermal collectors, concentrating parabolic trough (CPVT), a biomass heater, a single-stage absorption chiller and a multiple-effect distillation desalination system. The system is designed to cover the base load of an isolated small community. In previous papers, the dynamic simulation model about plant operation is discussed. In this paper, a detailed exergy, economic and environmental analysis of the plant is presented. In addition, the plant was optimized using different objective functions, applying the Design of Experiment (DoE) methodology which evaluates the sensitivity of the different objective functions with respect to the selected design parameters. The results show that an increase of the storage volume is generally negative, whereas increasing the solar field area involves an increase of the exergy destruction rate, but also an improvement of the CPVT exergy output provided; the final result is an increase of both the exergy efficiency and the economic profitability of the <b>polygeneration</b> system...|$|E
40|$|In the Mediterranean area, the {{increasing}} demand of summer cooling in domestic and small commercial sectors is usually satisfied by electrically-driven units; this involves electric load peaks and black-outs. Thus, an increasing interest occurs in small scale <b>polygeneration</b> systems fuelled by natural gas: a prime mover drives (mechanically, electrically, thermally) electric generators and/or heat pumps, desiccant wheels, etc., matching thermal (heating and cooling) and electric end-user requirements. In this paper, a test facility, located in Southern Italy, {{has been used to}} experimentally evaluate a small scale <b>polygeneration</b> system based on a natural gas-fired Micro-CHP and a desiccant-based hybrid HVAC system. The MCHP provides thermal power for the desiccant wheel regeneration and electric power for air handling unit auxiliaries, chiller and external units (computers, lights, etc.). The HVAC system can also operate in traditional way, interacting with the electric grid and a gas-fired boiler. An overview of the main results is shown, identifying the operating conditions (outdoor and supply air thermal-hygrometric conditions, electric grid efficiency, partial load operation of the MCHP) which guarantee significant primary energy savings (up to around 30 %) and greenhouse-gas emission reductions (up to around 40 %) of the <b>polygeneration</b> system compared to the conventional one...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn China <b>polygeneration</b> {{from coal}} via {{gasification}} {{is seen as}} a promising technology that responds to the issues of security of energy supply and climate change. However, the implementation of coal-gasification schemes is still hampered with a comparatively low operational availability, and the relative cost imposed by <b>polygeneration</b> is deemed high. First, the capital expenses become higher due to the more comprehensive processing scheme including oxygen production. Second, the inclusion of CCS will affect the operating cost owing to additional staff and reduced revenues, as there will be less electricity to sell. Third, the maintenance cost tends to grow due to increased complexity. A new virtual IGCC-CCS 11 I. e.  integrated gasification combined cycle with CCS. power cycle has been defined, which forms the base case for benchmarking. A reference case has been formed using the prestigious Chinese GreenGen project (phase 1) as model. The two cases are based with identical gasifiers as the core component. In contrast to the reference case using a gas turbine fuelled with syngas and without CO 2 capture, the virtual power cycle is made up using a generic hydrogen-burning gas turbine subsequent to an integrated gas separation unit in which CO 2 is removed (jointly with H 2 S). Hence, the two cases have been benchmarked in order {{to assess the impact of}} CO 2 capture on cost–notably without the inclusion of <b>polygeneration,</b> despite that <b>polygeneration</b> was part of the study (with hydrogen, ammonia, methanol and DME as co-products additional to electric power). The importance of this work is to assess techno-economic gaps in order to identify areas to address in order to improve process schemes towards an elevated stage of maturity...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{in this paper}} builds on a previous China MARKAL modeling effort to further explore alternative energy-technology strategies and assess {{the extent to which}} they could enable China to meet its social and economic development goals while ensuring national energy-supply security and promoting environmental protection and sustainable development. The present analysis is intended to help sharpen the focus on key strategic issues, policies, and programs for promoting an advanced energy-technology strategy in general and coal <b>polygeneration</b> technology in particu-lar. The detailed assessment of coal <b>polygeneration</b> technology is warranted because of its poten-tially central role in providing clean synthetic transportation fuels as well as electricity. The paper explores the following set of specific issues: (1) the costs and benefits of advanced energy-tech-nology strategies compared to strategies based on coal combustion for electricity generation and direct coal liquefaction to produce liquid fuels, (2) the impact that delays in the introduction of <b>polygeneration</b> technologies might have on overall energy system costs and on meeting environ-mental and energy security goals, (3) the impact of future, crisis-induced oil price shocks, (4) the impact of insufficiently aggressive end-use energy efficiency efforts, and (5) the relative costs of achieving reductions in air pollution and CO 2 emissions with different energy-technology strate...|$|E
40|$|<b>Polygeneration</b> is {{the process}} of {{combining}} multiple utility outputs with one or more input(s) in a single integrated unit. The integration is towards a higher energy efficiency as well as environment friendliness. Fossil fuels, specifically coal, will continue as the prime source of energy for a considerable future. However Carbon-dioxide emissions from coal based plants has serious „climate change ‟ effects. In this paper the Carbon-dioxide produced from the coal is utilized for production of ureain several well integrated and power-dominated <b>polygeneration</b> schemes. Power generation isby combined gas-steam power cycle. Other utilities of the <b>polygeneration</b> are utility heat and in some cases production of sulphuric acid. The utility heat obtained during urea production is proposed to be utilized by either heating the feed water in the steam cycle or by producing process steam. Different alternative schemes with similar utility outputs are discussed for relative advantages and disadvantages. Conceptualized schemes are not only CO 2 neutral though using coal but also compact and efficient with respect to same utility outputs in separate plants. Schematics show that depending upon one upstream process (say, gasification), downstream processes (say, carbon capture or urea production) may be changed according to their compatibility and state points may also vary for individual processes. Different utilities will also vary accordingly...|$|E
