5|$|From {{the middle}} of the 14th century, Bulgaria fell <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{aspirations}} of the Angevin king Louis I of Hungary, who annexed Moldavia in 1352 and established a vassal principality there, before conquering Vidin in 1365, and taking Ivan Sratsimir and his family into captivity.|$|E
5|$|Along the way, Rolling Thunder also fell <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same {{dysfunctional}} managerial attitude as did {{the rest}} of the American military effort in Southeast Asia. The process of the campaign became an end unto itself, with sortie generation as the standard by which progress was measured. Sortie rates and the number of bombs dropped, however, equaled efficiency, not effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Polyps feed on {{a variety}} of small organisms, from {{microscopic}} zooplankton to small fish. The polyp's tentacles immobilize or kill prey using their nematocysts. These cells carry venom which they rapidly release in response to contact with another organism. A dormant nematocyst discharges in response to nearby prey touching the trigger (cnidocil). A flap (operculum) opens and its stinging apparatus fires the barb into the prey. The venom is injected through the hollow filament to immobilise the prey; the tentacles then manoeuvre the <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mouth.|$|E

5|$|According to Filitti, the war {{spelled out}} {{the end of}} Romania's aristocratic order, leaving the country <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nouveaux riches and the neo-Jacobins. As the Conservative Party itself {{collapsed}} into obscurity, he remained largely {{cut off from the}} outside world, and rejected many of the recent innovations. Reportedly, he wrote all his books and articles in dip pen, and never watched a motion picture. After 1919, he had to recover from financial ruin, having entrusted the bulk of his assets (what had not been lost in the war) to a broker, who gambled it away and then committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|After Khan's {{departure}} from Comilla, the cooperative's model failed in independent Bangladesh because {{only a few}} occupational groups managed to achieve the desired success. By 1979, only 61 of the 400 cooperatives were functioning. The model actually fell <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ineffective internal and external controls, stagnation, and diversion of funds. This prompted the subsequent scholars and practitioners in microfinance, such as Muhammad Yunus of Grameen Bank and Fazle Hasan Abed of BRAC, to abandon the cooperative approach in favour of more centralised control and service delivery structures. The new strategy targeted the poorest villagers, while excluding the 'less poor'. However, Khan's leadership skills {{during the course of}} his association with the project remained a source of inspiration for these leaders, as well as other participatory development initiatives in the country.|$|E
5|$|By 1790, on the {{political}} front, the Commonwealth had deteriorated into such a helpless condition that it was forced into an unnatural and ultimately deadly alliance with its enemy, Prussia. The Polish-Prussian Pact of 1790 was signed, giving false hope that the Commonwealth might have at last found an ally that would shield it while it reformed itself. The May Constitution of 1791 enfranchised the bourgeoisie, established {{the separation of the}} three branches of government, and eliminated the abuses of Repnin Sejm. Those reforms prompted aggressive actions on the part of its neighbours, wary of the potential renaissance of the Commonwealth. Again Poland dared to reform and improve itself without Russia's permission, and again the Empress Catherine II was angered; arguing that Poland had fallen <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> radical Jacobinism then at high tide in France. Russian forces invaded the Commonwealth in 1792.|$|E
5|$|Predators and prey {{interact}} and coevolve, <b>the</b> predator <b>to</b> catch <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> more effectively, <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> escape. <b>The</b> coevolution {{of the two}} mutually imposes selective pressures. These often lead to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator, resulting in antipredator adaptations.|$|R
50|$|Harpy eagles {{routinely}} take prey weighing {{more than}} 7 kg. They possess the largest talons of any living eagle. They {{have been recorded}} as lifting <b>prey</b> up <b>to</b> equal their own body weight. That allows <b>the</b> birds <b>to</b> snatch a live sloth from tree branches, {{as well as other}} huge prey items. Males usually take relatively smaller prey, with a typical range of 0.5 to 2.5 kg or about half their own weight. The larger females take larger prey, with a minimum recorded prey weight of around 2.7 kg. Adult female harpies regularly grab large male howler or spider monkeys or mature sloths weighing 6 to 9 kg in flight and fly off without landing, an enormous feat of strength. <b>Prey</b> items taken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nest by the parents are normally medium-sized, having been recorded from 1 <b>to</b> 4 kg. <b>The</b> <b>prey</b> brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nest by males averaged 1.5 kg, while <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nest by females averaged 3.2 kg.|$|R

5|$|Most terns hunt fish by diving, often {{hovering}} first, and {{the particular}} approach technique used can help to distinguish similar species at a distance. Sea terns often hunt in association with porpoises or predatory fish, such as bluefish, tuna or bonitos, since these large marine animals drive the <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface. Sooty terns feed at night as the fish rise to the surface, and are believed {{to sleep on the}} wing since they become waterlogged easily. Terns of several species will feed on invertebrates, following the plough or hunting on foot on mudflats. The marsh terns normally catch insects in the air or pick them off the surface of fresh water. Other species will sometimes use these techniques if the opportunity arises. An individual tern's foraging efficiency increases with its age.|$|E
5|$|Nesting {{takes place}} in loose colonies, the nest a scrape found on a cliff face that is easy to take off from. A single egg is laid, being {{incubated}} by both sexes for about six weeks. Whether the egg hatches or not can be influenced by pollution and weather, although the latter has a minimal effect on whether a chick fledges or not. After a chick fledges, the parents will usually stop visiting the nest and the chick will leave. Birds of all ages feed on fish and squid, catching them by diving from the air into the water. However, the red-billed tropicbird sometimes follows surface-feeding predators. The predators will drive the <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface, which are then seized by the tropicbird.|$|E
5|$|Although {{observations}} of living goblin sharks are scant, its anatomy suggests its lifestyle is inactive and sluggish. Its skeleton is reduced and poorly calcified, the muscle blocks along its sides (myomeres) are weakly developed, and its fins {{are soft and}} small. Its long caudal fin, held at a low angle, is also typical of a slow-swimming shark. The long snout {{appears to have a}} sensory function, as it bears numerous ampullae of Lorenzini that can detect the weak electric fields produced by other animals. Due to the snout's softness, it is unlikely to be used for stirring up prey from the bottom as has been proposed. Vision seems to be less important than other senses, considering the relatively small optic tectum in the shark's brain. Yet unlike most deep-sea sharks, it can change the size of its pupils, thus probably does use its sight in some situations. Goblin sharks may fall <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> blue shark (Prionace glauca). Parasites documented from this species include the copepod Echthrogaleus mitsukurinae, and the tapeworms Litobothrium amsichensis and Marsupiobothrium gobelinus.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the multi-foraging task {{studied in}} this paper, {{a group of}} robots has to {{efficiently}} retrieve {{two different types of}} <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> a nest. Robots have to decide when they leave <b>the</b> nest <b>to</b> forage and which <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> retrieve. <b>The</b> goal {{of this study is to}} identify an efficient multi-foraging behaviour, where efficiency is defined as a function of the energy that is spent by the robots during exploration and gained when a <b>prey</b> is retrieved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nest. We design and validate a mathematical model that is used <b>to</b> predict <b>the</b> optimal behaviour. We introduce a decision algorithm and use simulations to study its performance in a wide range of experimental situations with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> predictions of the mathematical model. Key words: swarm robotics, multi-foraging, mathematical modelling. ...|$|R

5|$|Fortunately for the party, {{the reunification}} of worlds has opened the {{pathways}} to ancient sites where weapons and powers used to quell Enuo's rise a thousand years past lay in wait. So armed, the party enters the Rift, seeking out Exdeath {{at the center of}} the inter-dimensional nexus where they, too, fall <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Void. With help from their fallen allies, the party survives and is returned before Exdeath, now manifested as a demonic sylvan, battling him until he weakens and is swallowed by his own power. He then transforms into Neo Exdeath, intent on destroying the very essence of reality, himself with it. Exdeath is ultimately defeated, and, using the power of the Crystal shards, the heroes seal the Void once more and restore the reunified world and its Crystals. The game's ending varies based on how many party members are still alive at Neo Exdeath's defeat, detailing the events after the world's resurrection. At the end, the remaining group visits the Guardian Tree, and find that the fallen party members have returned to life.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched New Guinea {{crocodiles}} feed on aquatic insects, spiders, tadpoles, freshwater snails, frogs, {{fish and}} small mammals. As they grow, {{so does the}} size of their prey and their consumption of fish rises, but they still will eat anything of a worthwhile size that they can find. An adult's diet is largely fish, caught by sweeping the snout sideways and snapping at the prey, but also includes shrimps, crabs, frogs, snakes, birds and medium-sized mammals. A crocodile catches its prey by stealth with a flick of its head, impaling it with its sharp teeth and gripping and crushing it. The jaws cannot move sideways to chew the food; instead, the crocodile's head is tossed to move the <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back of the mouth before the prey is swallowed whole. This crocodile is surprisingly agile and can lunge its body upward into the air to catch bats, flying birds, and leaping fish. It can also probe into the mud {{at the bottom of a}} river or swamp with its snout to search for crabs and molluscs.|$|E
5|$|The {{next morning}} saw the {{squadron}} participate in Operation Tagar, a SEAD offensive against Egyptian air defences, {{which began with}} strikes against Egyptian air bases. Seven Phantoms led by squadron leader Yoram Agmon struck the air base at Gianaclis, and although two defending MiG-21s were shot down, the strike failed to cause significant damage. Tagar, moreover, was quickly discontinued when the dire situation on the Golan Heights became apparent, and 69 Squadron efforts were redirected north where the IAF staged the ill-fated Operation Doogman 5. Flying with outdated intelligence and no electronic screening against mobile SAM batteries and heavy flak, 6 IAF Phantoms were lost, including 69 Squadron's Ehud Hankin and Shaul Levy in Kurnass 123. Both were killed. The same evening saw appeals for help from the southern front, leading the squadron to fly strike missions against Egyptian bridges and assembly point on the Suez Canal. Another Phantom was lost to surface-to-air missiles, its crew falling into captivity. Four more aircraft were lost on the following day, October 8. One was lost in an otherwise successful morning strike against the Syrian air base at Dumayr, its crew captured. Another was lost over the Golan Heights, and two more during night strikes against Egyptian bridges across the canal, all falling <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> SA-6. Although four airmen were rescued by Israeli forces, pilot Zvulun Amizi and navigator Zeev Yogev were killed.|$|E

5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the behaviour of a <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> avoid <b>the</b> {{pursuit of a}} predator at predator-prey relationship to be appeared in the collective behavior of animals. One of <b>the</b> methods <b>to</b> avoid <b>the</b> pursuit of a predator is to rotate quickly when a predator arrives near to it. At that moment, a critical distance and a rotating angular are very important for <b>the</b> <b>prey</b> in order <b>to</b> survive from <b>the</b> pursuit, where the critical distance is {{the distance between the}} predator and the prey just before rotation. In order <b>to</b> analyze <b>the</b> critical distance and the rotating angular, this paper introduces the energy for a predator which it has at starting point of the chase and consumes during the chase. Through simulations, we can know that the rotating angle for a <b>prey</b> <b>to</b> survive from <b>the</b> pursuit is increased when the critical distance is shorter and when the ratio of predator's mass and prey's mass is also decreased. The results of simulations are the similar phenomenon in nature and therefore it means that <b>the</b> method <b>to</b> analyze in this paper is correct...|$|R
