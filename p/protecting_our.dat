500|$|Fuck: Word Taboo and <b>Protecting</b> <b>Our</b> First Amendment Liberties {{was first}} {{published}} in 2009 in paperback by Sphinx Publishing, and in an electronic format for the Amazon Kindle the same year. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer called Fairman's paper compelling and amusing. The Horn Book Magazine described the paper as a contemplative scholarly work which was simultaneously an engaging read. Writing in the San Diego Law Review, Orly Lobel called Fairman's article a thought-provoking analysis into how the law and the First Amendment address issues of sexual language. In a 2011 article for the Federal Communications Law Journal, W.Wat Hopkins was critical of Fairman's article and subsequent book, writing that both appeared to be formats for the author to repeatedly use the word [...] "fuck", rather than actually analyze the subject from a rigorous perspective.|$|E

[...] Nussbaum had helped found it, merging into it the Jackson Interfaith Fellowship. The Reverend Thomas Tiller, the Alliance president, stated that [...] "by default, we may have contributed to a climate of opinion which gives rise to terrorism.

500|$|Fuck: Word Taboo and <b>Protecting</b> <b>Our</b> First Amendment Liberties is a nonfiction book by law {{professor}} Christopher M. Fairman about freedom of speech, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, censorship, {{and use of}} the word fuck in society. The book was first published in 2009 by Sphinx as a follow-up on the author's article [...] "Fuck", published in 2007 in the Cardozo Law Review. It cites studies from academics in social science, psychoanalysis, and linguistics. Fairman establishes that most current usages of the word have connotations distinct from its meaning of sexual intercourse. The book discusses the efforts of conservatives in the United States to censor the word from common parlance. The author says that legal precedent regarding its use is unclear because of contradictory court decisions. Fairman argues that once citizens allow the government to restrict the use of specific words, this will lead to an encroachment upon freedom of thought.|$|E
500|$|A {{turning point}} came for {{development}} in the Everglades at the proposition of an expanded airport after Miami International Airport outgrew its capacities. The new jetport was planned to be larger than O'Hare, Dulles, JFK, and LAX airports combined, and the chosen location was [...] north of Everglades National Park. The first sentence of the U.S. Department of Interior study of {{the environmental impact of}} the jetport read, [...] "Development of the proposed jetport and its attendant facilities... will inexorably destroy the south Florida ecosystem and thus the Everglades National Park". When studies indicated the proposed jetport would create [...] of raw sewage a day and [...] of jet engine pollutants a year, the project met staunch opposition. The New York Times called it a [...] "blueprint for disaster", and Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson wrote to President Richard Nixon voicing his opposition: [...] "It is a test of whether or not we are really committed in this country to <b>protecting</b> <b>our</b> environment." [...] Governor Claude Kirk withdrew his support for the project, and Marjory Stoneman Douglas was persuaded at 79years old to go on tour to give hundreds of speeches against it.

The province's educational minister, Madelaine Dubé, said: [...] "It is {{good to know that}} our schools can also contribute to <b>protecting</b> <b>our</b> environment." [...] The school held its inauguration ceremony with Bernard Lord present on September 30, 2005, despite its delayed opening {{a few days after the}} beginning of the 200506 school year.

[...] "Parents, students and teaching staff now have modern, state of the art facilities. I feel very proud about this project and I am delighted that it is now a reality."

500|$|When studies {{indicated}} the proposed jetport would create [...] of raw sewage {{a day and}} [...] of jet engine pollutants a year, the national media snapped to attention. Science magazine wrote, in a series on environmental protection highlighting the jetport project, [...] "Environmental scientists have become increasingly aware that, without careful planning, development of a region and the conservation of its natural resources do not go hand in hand". The New York Times called it a [...] "blueprint for disaster", and Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson wrote to President Richard Nixon voicing his opposition: [...] "It is a test {{of whether or not}} we are really committed in this country to <b>protecting</b> <b>our</b> environment." [...] Governor Claude Kirk withdrew his support for the project, and the 78-year-old Marjory Stoneman Douglas was persuaded to go on tour to give hundreds of speeches against it. She established Friends of the Everglades and encouraged more than 3,000members to join. Initially the U.S. Department of Transportation pledged funds to support the jetport, but after pressure, Nixon overruled the department. He instead established Big Cypress National Preserve, announcing it in the Special Message to the Congress Outlining the 1972 Environmental Program. Following the jetport proposition, restoration of the Everglades became not only a statewide priority, but an international one as well. In the 1970s the Everglades were declared an International Biosphere Reserve and a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, and a Wetland of International Importance by the Ramsar Convention, making it one of only three locations on earth that have appeared on all three lists.|$|E

[...] When such a project is determined to have significant effects on the human environment, an environmental impact statement (EIS) is required. An EIS for a proposed project outlines in detail the proposed actions, alternative actions (including no action), and their probable environmental ramifications.

2500|$|On 4 May, Milner penned {{a memorable}} {{dispatch}} to the Colonial Office, {{in which he}} insisted that the remedy for the unrest in the Transvaal was to strike {{at the root of}} the evil—the political impotence of the injured Uitlanders. [...] "It may seem a paradox," [...] he wrote, [...] "but it is true that the only way for <b>protecting</b> <b>our</b> subjects is to help them to cease to be our subjects." [...] The policy of leaving things alone only led from bad to worse, and [...] "the case for intervention is overwhelming." [...] Milner felt that only the enfranchisement of the Uitlanders in the Transvaal would give stability to the South African situation. He had not based his case against the Transvaal on the letter of the Conventions, and regarded the employment of the word [...] "suzerainty" [...] merely as an [...] "etymological question," [...] but he realized keenly that the spectacle of thousands of British subjects in the Transvaal in the condition of [...] "helots" [...] (as he expressed it) was undermining the prestige of Great Britain throughout South Africa, and he called for [...] "some striking proof" [...] of the intention of the British government not to be ousted from its predominant position. This dispatch was telegraphed to London, and was intended for immediate publication; but it was kept private for a time by the home government.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} Monday, the Queen {{issued a}} statement saying that she would not attempt to amend the constitution except by the means provided in the 1887 constitution. However, the Committee of Safety did not believe her promise was sincere, and continued with their planning. A group of men mostly drawn from the ranks of the Reform Party of the Hawaiian Kingdom formed the Committee of Safety and asked the United States Minister, John L. Stevens, to land troops from the U.S.S. Boston (anchored in Honolulu Harbor) into Honolulu, to protect American lives and property. John L. Stevens, reacting to what he saw as potential unrest as the internal crisis continued, requested the landing of about 160 Marines, who were given specific orders by Captain G. C. Wiltse to [...] "land in Honolulu for the purpose of <b>protecting</b> <b>our</b> legation, consulate, and the lives and property of American citizens, and to assist in preserving public order." [...] At 2:00pm on January 17, 1893, a proclamation was read on the steps of Government building, declaring the monarchy overthrown. U.S. peacekeepers were at the time stationed at Arion Hall, the U.S. Consulate, and the U.S. Legation, under orders of strict neutrality and out of any potential line of fire between the Provisional Government and Royalist forces. The Queen abdicated under protest ostensibly [...] "to the superior force of the United States government", though her surrender was delivered to the Provisional Government, not the United States. The Kingdom of Hawaii had ended, and a new provisional government was declared.|$|E
