2500|$|For 1969, a new one-piece, full-width grille, new {{taillights}} {{and trim}} were featured. Standard engines were unchanged, although refinements in the Chrysler Clean Air System (formerly Clean Air Package) produced better operating economy from the 6-cylinder engines. Improved drum brake self-adjusters, {{a more efficient}} <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>pump,</b> and improvements to the optional Sure-Grip differential were also highlighted. [...] Starting with cars built on January 1, 1969, front seat headrests were now standard. 1969 Valiants did not have side marker lamps, they would return in 1970.|$|E
2500|$|Differences to the RHD Australian AMXs (compared to the U.S. models) {{included}} different outside rear-view mirrors, {{and black}} vinyl trim inside the [...] "AMX" [...] circle logo on the C-pillars, As with Rambler sedans built in right hand drive, windscreen wipers were not reversed, remaining LHD pattern, {{but the power}} brake booster and heater on the firewall were swapped over. Although the <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>pump</b> remained in its usual left location, {{the remainder of the}} steering components were {{on the right side of}} the car. The cars came with [...] and automatic transmission, power steering, power disk brakes, [...] "twin-grip" [...] rear axle, and other items that were optional on the U.S. models. All of the Australian AMX interiors were finished in black and featured unique seats, door panels, and a fiberglass RHD dashboard with a wood-grained instrument cluster in front of the driver. The Australian AMXs came with a large high level of equipment and were promoted as [...] "super" [...] personal luxury cars.|$|E
2500|$|The RX 400h {{gasoline}} engine switched off automatically {{and the car}} ran completely on electricity when either stationary, decelerating, or being driven at slow speeds—less than [...] Not only did the hybrid drive in the RX 400h improve fuel economy, but {{with the assistance of}} the electric motor, the RX 400h could reach [...] in 7.3 seconds, quicker than the gasoline-only RX. Despite the increased performance, the RX 400h/Harrier Hybrid consumed roughly the same amount of gasoline as a compact four-cylinder sedan and it qualified as a Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (SULEV) in the US. Passing power at lower and mid engine rpm's was noticeably improved due to the electric motor. The water pump for the {{gasoline engine}} is driven by the camshaft belt. To improve efficiency, and because the gasoline engine shuts down during electric-only operation, the alternator, <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>pump,</b> and air conditioner compressor are beltless; rather than being tied to engine output, these components are powered by electric motors via the battery instead.|$|E
50|$|Rotational {{movement}} to spin conventional automobile engine accessories such as alternators, air conditioner compressors, <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>pumps,</b> and anti-pollution devices could be captured from a turbine {{situated in the}} exhaust stream.|$|R
25|$|Drive train, {{front and}} rear suspension, brakes, radiators, master cylinders, trunnions, <b>steering</b> columns, <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>pumps,</b> engines, transmissions, brake drums and rotors are {{interchangeable}} with 1965 and 1966 Ambassadors and Classics. Some parts are even interchangeable back to 1958 and earlier, while other components were used by AMC into the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Some of the <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>pumps</b> were sourced from General Motors' Saginaw Gear division, {{while others}} were sourced from Atsugi. This was the second Nissan to use US-sourced parts besides the Borg-Warner T-5 {{transmission}} used in the 82-86 Nissan ZX Turbos. The use of USA-made parts was phased in prior {{to the passage of}} local content laws imposed by the U.S. Government.|$|R
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between {{the rotation of the}} camshaft and the rotation of the crankshaft is of critical importance. Since the valves control the flow of the air/fuel mixture intake and exhaust gases, they must be opened and closed at the appropriate time during the stroke of the piston. For this reason, the camshaft is connected to the crankshaft either directly, via a gear mechanism, or indirectly via a belt or chain called a timing belt or timing chain. [...] Direct drive using gears is unusual because of the cost. The frequently reversing torque caused by the slope of the cams tends to cause gear rattle which for an all-metal gear train requires further expense of a cam damper. Rolls-Royce V8 (1954) used gear drive as, unlike chain, it could be made silent and to last the life of the engine. Where gears are used in cheaper cars, they tend to be made from resilient fibre rather than metal, except in racing engines that have a high maintenance routine. Fibre gears have a short life span and must be replaced regularly, much like a timing belt. In some designs the camshaft also drives the distributor and the oil and fuel pumps. [...] Some vehicles may have the <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>pump</b> driven by the camshaft. [...] With some early fuel injection systems, cams on the camshaft would operate the fuel injectors. Honda redesigned the VF750 motorcycle from chain drive to the gear drive VFR750 due to insurmountable problems with the VF750 Hi-Vo inverted chain drive.|$|E
50|$|Use of {{the wrong}} type of fluid can lead to failure of the <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 1999-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee had a {{hydraulically}} driven radiator fan, {{powered by}} the SUV's <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{much of the}} 20th century, Saginaw's {{economy was}} {{dominated}} by manufacturing related to the automotive industry; most notably, manual transmission assemblies, steering gear boxes and <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>pumps.</b> At the height of manufacturing in the 1960s and 1970s, the city and neighboring Buena Vista Township hosted 12 General Motors plants, an Eaton Manufacturing plant where 5,000 people turned out auto parts (demolished 2008), and numerous smaller concerns.|$|R
50|$|<b>Power</b> <b>steering</b> is {{supplied}} as standard. However, because the continuous {{rotation of the}} engine is not available on an electric vehicle, an electric motor is used to <b>power</b> a <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> hydraulic <b>pump.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Minimal noise {{pollution}} - Unlike trams or gasoline and diesel buses, trolleybuses are almost silent, lacking {{the noise of}} an engine or wheels on rails. Most noise comes from auxiliary systems such as <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>pumps</b> and air conditioning. Early trolleybuses without these systems were even quieter and, in the UK at least, were {{often referred to as}} the [...] "Silent Service". This however can also be seen as a disadvantage, with some pedestrians falling victim to what was known as [...] "Silent Death" [...] (in Britain) or [...] "Whispering Death" [...] (in Australia).|$|R

50|$|It is a {{replacement}} of S 320 CDI with improved fuel efficiency. Changes include: on-demand electric hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>pump,</b> standstill decoupling for the 7G-TRONIC automatic transmission, and 17-inch light-alloy wheels with reduced rolling resistance tyres.|$|E
50|$|An {{underdrive}} pulley {{refers to}} a crankshaft or accessory pulley (a/c, alternator, <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> water <b>pump,</b> etc.) designed to turn at a slower speed than stock. To Underdrive means to slow the rate of rotation in a system. Underdrive is achieved by either making the crank/main (drive) pulley smaller or the accessory (driven) pulley larger than the original diameter pulleys.|$|R

40|$|AbstractRemanufacturing is {{a series}} of {{processes}} which makes the old product functionally equivalent and visually indistinguishable from a new product. In this research, we analyzed characteristics of target product (<b>power</b> <b>steering</b> oil <b>pump</b> of vehicle) and designed a new algorithm which let us know the cause process of possible failures that can be occurred after remanufacturing. Problems of remanufacturing process were identified by comparing and evaluating the most serious causes deduced by the algorithm which were applied to each failure type...|$|R
50|$|Earlier HICAS {{versions}} used hydraulics {{to steer}} the rear wheels. The hydraulic system was powered by the <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>pump</b> and used speed sensors {{to determine how much}} and in which direction {{to steer the}} rear wheels.|$|E

The following features are standard: climate control, ABC (hydraulic) suspension, all-leather interior, designer wood trim, trip computer, CD, navigation system, front heated seats, power moonroof, as well as power door and trunk closing assist. Optional features include a heated steering wheel and voice-activated telephone, as well as, front fan-cooled and heated seats.|$|R
50|$|A {{long block}} engine {{replacement}} typically requires swapping out parts {{from the original}} engine to the long block. These parts include the oil pan, timing cover, valve covers, intake manifold, emission-control parts, carburetor or fuel injection system, the exhaust manifold(s), alternator, starter, <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>pump</b> (if any), and air conditioner compressor (if any).|$|E
50|$|A {{serpentine}} belt, {{also known}} as a multi-vee, poly-v, or multi-rib belt, is a single, continuous belt used to drive multiple peripheral devices in an automotive engine, such as an alternator, <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>pump,</b> water pump, air conditioning compressor, air pump, etc. The belt may also be guided by an idler pulley and/or a belt tensioner (which may be spring-loaded, hydraulic, or manual).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{design and}} quality of {{steering}} mechanism {{is directly related to}} forklift traction, mobility, steering stability and safe operation. A multi-objective optimization model of the forklift steering mechanism is established in this paper. The objective function is minimum oil cylinder stroke difference and the minimum <b>power</b> oil <b>pump.</b> <b>Steering</b> torque, geometrical angles, geometry size and the hydraulic system pressure are used as constraint conditions. We use non dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II) based on the Pareto optimal concept to optimize and calculate model and get the optimal design of steering mechanism...|$|R

5000|$|The SUV {{was first}} {{released}} in 1998 with a 2.0-litre turbo I4 Diesel engine.It was later upgrade in 2003 {{as a part}} of next improved Versions first EX and then EX2 along with Limited edition roll-out with improved interiors and Mechanics which included <b>Power</b> <b>steering,</b> fuel <b>pump,</b> electricals. By far the TCIC EX2 2003-2006 models were the most reliable and refined TCIC Safari.The Safari was extensively modified in August 2005, which included the addition of a new 3-litre DiCOR engine along with modified interiors and exteriors. This 3-litre engine is the first diesel engine from Tata Motors with common rail technology. A 2-litre petrol engineMPFi was also added to the range that same year. It was this modified version that won the Motor Forum's Car of the Year for 2007, in the SUV category. Voted by the users in India.In October 2007 Tata unveiled the 2.2-litre Safari DiCOR which had an increased power output of 143 PS (105 KW). But it was shortly replaced by the more advanced DiCOR 2.2 VTT (Variable Turbine Technology) engine which had a power output of [...] at 4000 rpm and a torque output of 320 Nm at 1700 rpm. It is widely regarded as the best engine used by Tata Motors.|$|R
50|$|Modifying the {{accessory}} drive system can increase fuel economy and performance to some extent. Underdrive pulleys modify the amount of engine power that can be drawn by accessory devices. Such alterations to the drive systems for alternators or air conditioning compressors (rather than the <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>pump,</b> for example) can be detrimental to vehicle usability (e.g., by not keeping the battery fully charged), but will not impair safety.|$|E
50|$|The {{drawback}} of {{this single}} belt {{is that if}} the belt breaks or is knocked loose, the vehicle instantly loses multiple critical functions. The water pump, <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>pump,</b> and alternator (for battery charging) would cease functioning. The vehicle becomes quickly unusable due to loss of engine cooling. The belt typically gives ample visual warning of impending failure, sometimes even totally shedding several grooves (ribs) while continuing to function acceptably.|$|E
5000|$|All {{engine-driven}} accessories, {{such as the}} alternator, <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> <b>pump,</b> {{air conditioning}} compressor, and radiator fan, are accessible from the front hood, driven off {{the front of the}} engine by an accessory driveshaft, and is known as the Supplemental Accessory Drive System, or [...] "SADS." [...] This allows for even front/rear weight distribution, which benefits ride quality and handling. However, it also prevents the installation of a larger engine, while the cost could not be relayed by sharing the platform with other vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|The CL coupés come {{equipped}} {{with the very latest}} in Mercedes-Benz technology, and along with the S-Class saloons the CL coupés receive new technological features (it introduced the refined Active Body Control fully active suspension system and Bi-Xenon HID lights).

Black Oak engine management system. The engine was sourced from the Ford of Mexico Chihuahua plant. The vehicle final-assembly was in the Ford Saarlouis plant in Germany, with some content such as the subwoofer assembled off-line at the ACÜ facility attached to the plant. There was an additional Wagon/Estate variant (codename Swordfish) launched in Europe-only in 2003, which featured Nivomat self-levelling rear dampers.|$|R
25|$|Also {{new to the}} GS {{line was}} an Electric <b>Power</b> <b>Steering</b> (EPS) system {{replacing}} the previous model's hydraulic <b>steering</b> <b>pump,</b> while the V8 model featured a Variable Gear Ratio Steering (VGRS) system and Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB) a type of brake-by-wire system. In August 2005, the GS 430 was the first car by Toyota with Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). AVS monitors and adjusts the shock-absorber settings at each wheel, depending on the conditions. On rough roads, for example, damping is reduced for a more comfortable ride. And, while cornering, the suspension is tightened to help reduce body lean and provide even greater responsiveness. Using the EPS system the GS can automatically compensate for crosswinds.|$|R
