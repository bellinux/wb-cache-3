40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effect of <b>pelletized</b> or extruded diets, with different levels of carbohydrate and lipid, on the gastrointestinal transit time (GITT) and its modulation in pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus). One hundred and eighty pacu juveniles were fed with eight isonitrogenous diets containing two carbohydrate levels (40 and 50 %) and two lipid levels (4 and 8 %). Four diets were <b>pelletized</b> and four were extruded. Carbohydrate and lipid experimental levels caused no changes to the bolus transit time. However, the bolus permanence time was related to diet processing. Fish fed <b>pelletized</b> diets exhibited the highest gastrointestinal transit time. Regression analysis of bolus behavior for <b>pelletized</b> and extruded diets with 4 % lipid depicted different fits. GITT regression analysis of fish fed 8 % lipid was fitted to a cubic equation and displayed adjustments of food permanence, with enhanced utilization of the diets, either with extruded or <b>pelletized</b> diets. GITT of fish fed extruded diets with 4 % lipid was adjusted to a linear equation. The GITT of pacu depends on the diet processing and is affected by dietary levels of lipid and carbohydrate...|$|R

Reconstruction started with private dwellings and a workshop at Kirkenes, with 73 apartments completed by 1947. Sydvaranger considered changing its mining methods, but new technology resulted in the company continuing with open-pit excavation. Detailed plans for the facilities was issued to the ministry on 16 May 1947. The main change of operations was introduction of <b>pelletizing.</b> A public inquiry of the possibilities was carried out through 1947 {{and concluded that the}} company would need NOK124million in capital, including NOK22million to cover running costs.

40|$|This report {{explores the}} use of {{compacted}} zeolite pellets as templates for the preparation of <b>pelletized</b> zeolite templated carbons (ZTCs). The effects of zeolite compaction before use as hard templates were investigated through the compression of powder forms of zeolites at 370 MPa or 740 MPa prior to their use as templates. The resulting carbon samples were compared to compacted conventionally templated (with powdered zeolites) ZTC. The use of compacted zeolite pellets results in <b>pelletized</b> ZTCs that simultaneously exhibit higher porosity and higher packing density, which translates to highly enhanced volumetric gas (CO 2 and hydrogen) uptake. For CVD-derived samples, the <b>pelletized</b> ZTCs achieve 10 % higher surface area than powdered samples (and reach > 2000 m 2 g- 1) despite their packing density increasing from ca. 0. 55 to 0. 85 g cm- 3, {{which means that the}} surface area per unit volume increases by ca. 60 % from between 1000 and 1100 m 2 cm- 3 for the powdered ZTCs to ca. 1670 m 2 cm- 3 for <b>pelletized</b> samples. Thus their volumetric CO 2 uptake at 25 oC increases by 140 % and 85 % at 1 and 20 bar, respectively, compared to powdered ZTCs. <b>Pelletized</b> ZTCs prepared via a combination of liquid impregnation and CVD achieve much higher surface area of 3000 m 2 g- 1 (compared to 2700 m 2 g- 1 for powder samples) despite an increase in packing density from 0. 44 to 0. 69 g cm- 3, resulting in a surface area per unit volume rise of 75 % from 1189 m 2 cm- 3 to 2085 m 2 cm- 3. The high surface area <b>pelletized</b> ZTCs have attractive gravimetric hydrogen uptake of 6. 6 wt% (5. 5 wt% for powdered sample) at 20 bar and - 196 oC, and reach volumetric hydrogen storage capacity of 46 g l- 1 (24 g l- 1 for powder sample). For CO 2 uptake at 25 oC and at 20 bar, the volumetric uptake of the high surface area <b>pelletized</b> ZTC is nearly twice that of the powdered sample; 668 g l- 1 compared to 360 g l- 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{fluidized}} bed combustion of three <b>pelletized</b> biogenic fuels (sewage Sludge, wood, and straw) {{has been investigated}} {{with a combination of}} experimental techniques. The fuels have been characterized from the standpoints of patterns and rates of fuel devolatilization and char burnout, extent of attrition and fragmentation, and their relevance to the fuel particle size distribution and the amount and size distribution of primary ash particles. Results highlight differences and similarities among the three fuels tested. The fuels were all characterized by limited primary fragmentation and relatively long devolatilization times, as compared with the time scale of particle dispersion away from the fuel feeding ports in practical FBC. Both features are favorable to effective lateral distribution of volatile matter across the combustor cross section. The three fuels exhibited distinctively different char conversion patterns. The high-ash <b>pelletized</b> sludge burned according to the shrinking core conversion pattern with negligible Occurrence of secondary fragmentation. The low-ash <b>pelletized</b> wood burned according to the shrinking particle conversion pattern with extensive occurrence of secondary fragmentation. The medium-ash <b>pelletized</b> straw yielded char particles with a hollow structure, resembling big cenospheres, characterized by a coherent inorganic outer layer strong enough to prevent particle fragmentation. Inert bed particles were permanently attached to the hollow pellets as they were incorporated into ash melts. Carbon elutriation rates were very small for all the fuels tested. For <b>pelletized</b> sludge and straw, this was mostly due to the shielding effect of the coherent ash skeleton. For the wood pellet, carbon attrition was extensive, but was largely counterbalanced by effective afterburning due to the large intrinsic reactivity of attrited char fines. The impact of carbon attrition on combustion efficiency was negligible for all the fuels tested. The size distribution of primary ash particles liberated upon complete carbon burnoff largely reflected the combustion pattern of each fuel. Primary ash particles of size nearly equal to that of the parent fuel were generated upon complete burnoff of the <b>pelletized</b> sludge. Nonetheless, secondary attrition of primary ash from <b>pelletized</b> sludge is large, to the point where generation of fine ash would be extensive over the typical residence time of bed ash in {{fluidized bed}} combustors. Very few and relatively fine primary ash particles were released after complete burnoff of wood pellets. Primary ash particles remaining after complete burnoff of <b>pelletized</b> straw had sizes and shapes that were largely controlled by the Occurrence of ash agglomeration phenomena.

40|$|Bulk biofuel, biomass pellets and <b>pelletized</b> biomass-coal blends were combusted in {{a typical}} rural {{conventional}} household stove and a high-efficiency stove. Reductions in PM 2. 5, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) emissions were evaluated by comparing emission factors (EFs) among 19 combinations of biofuel/residential stove types measured using a dilution sampling system. In the low efficiency stove, the average EFs of PM 2. 5, OC, and EC of biomass pellets were 2. 64 +/- 1. 56, 0. 42 +/- 0. 36, and 0. 30 +/- 0. 11 g/kg, respectively, significantly lower than those burned in bulk form. EFPM 2. 5 and EFOC of <b>pelletized</b> biomass combustion in the high-efficiency stove were {{lower than those of}} the same biofuel burned in the low-efficiency stove. Furthermore, <b>pelletized</b> corn residue and coal blends burned in the high-efficiency stove could significantly decrease emissions. Compared with the bulk material burned in the low-efficiency stove, the reduction rates of PM 2. 5, OC and EC from <b>pelletized</b> blends in the high-efficiency stove can reach 84 %, 96 % and 93 %, respectively. If the annually produced corn residues in 2010 had been blended with 10 % anthracite coal powder and burnt as pellets, it would have reduced about 82 % of PM 2. 5, 90 - 96 % of OC and 81 - 92 % of EC emission in comparison with burning raw materials in conventional household stoves. Given the low cost, high health benefit and reduction effect on atmospheric pollutants, <b>pelletized</b> blends could be a promising alternative to fossil fuel resources or traditional bulk biofuel.

40|$|Foamed {{concrete}} is {{a controlled}} low density ranging from 400 kg/m 3 to 1800 kg/m 3, and hence {{suitable for the}} construction of buildings and infrastructures. The uniqueness of foamed concrete is does not use aggregates in order to retain low density. Foamed concrete contains only cement, sand, water and foam agent. Therefore, the consumption of cement is higher in producing a good quality and strength of foamed concrete. Without the present of aggregates, the compressive strength of foamed concrete can only achieve as high as 15 MPa. Therefore, this study aims to introduce the <b>pelletized</b> coconut fibre aggregate to reduce the consumption of cement but able to enhance the compressive strength. In the experimental study, forty-five (45) cube samples of foamed concrete with density 1600 kg/m 3 were prepared with different volume fractions of <b>pelletized</b> coconut fibre aggregate. All cube samples were tested using the compression test to obtain compressive strength.
