40|$|Chlorinated {{paraffins}} (CPs) are industrially produced compounds of {{the general}} formula Cn H 2 n- 2 -z Clz, with the chlorine content between 10 - 72 %. Because of their chemical and thermal stability and high viscosity, chlorinated paraffins replaced PCBs in many applications after PCB usage was banned (Tomy G. T. et al., 1998; Coelhan M. et al., 2000; Koh I. O. et al., 2002) : as lubricants and cutting fluids in metalworking industry, as flame retardants, <b>paints,</b> <b>sealing</b> materials and others. In the last decade, the annual world-wide production of CPs has been estimated to 300 000 tons. The stability and low vapor pressure of CPs (comparable with PCBs and other semi-volatile compounds) influences their persistence in the environment. They have a potency to bioconcentration in the living organisms where they can cause a grow inhibition. CP pollutants were suggested to be included into UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution POPs Protocol after analysis the air samples from United Kingdom. The short chain chlorinated paraffins are listed as toxic compounds for aquatic organisms (WHO (World Health Organization), 1996; Vollrath A.

40|$|Ancient {{images as}} much as texts attest to the worldviews and symbol systems of past societies. On the {{occasion}} of its 20 th anniversary, the Swiss Society for Ancient Near Eastern Studies invited an international group of distinguished scholars to explore new approaches to the pictorial heritage of ancient civilizations. In an age concerned as never before by the global impact of visual media, archaeologists and art historians were asked to address ancient images as media and primary sources {{for the history of}} human civilization. The symposium concentrated on the 1 st millennium BCE, when ideas and objects originating in distant cultures entered a period of unprecedented interaction with the advent of early empires and large interregional trade networks. It highlighted ancient states and people in contact, exchanging and adapting concepts and beliefs alongside with their merchandise and skills. The fifteen papers published here cover a large area from Thebes to Persepolis, paying particular attention to the zones of contact in the Levant. They establish dialogues between the autochtonous and the imported, the monumental and the minute: palace reliefs and statuary, metalwork and ivory carving, vase <b>painting,</b> <b>seals</b> and coinage. They do not consider images primarily as art but as media designed to convey messages, political or cultural, social or religious. Images are thus taken seriously, being addressed as documents involving human intellect and knowledge, tradition and creativity, economy and practical use, consumers' taste and craftsmen's competence...|$|R
