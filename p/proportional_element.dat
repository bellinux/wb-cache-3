This model consists of three independent height controllers, each having a unique characteristic. The coupling of these three controllers is performed me-chanically.

40|$|Abstract: The {{traditional}} deadbeat {{control for}} UPS inverters has a robustness problem. The parametric imprecision can greatly harm {{the stability of}} the system, which restricts the application. A novel robust deadbeat control method is proposed in this paper to deal with the problem. In the proposed control method, a <b>proportional</b> <b>element</b> is added to the traditional deadbeat control in order to improve the robustness to parametric imprecision. To eliminate the error between output voltage and voltage reference caused by environmental noise and parametric deviat ion, a model reference adaptive regulator is also added to the control method. A 1 kVA prototype is built based on DSP. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the robustness for parametric variat ion of the proposed method is much better than the traditional deadbeat control. The system can remain stable even when the systemic parameters have a large deviat ion from calculating parameters. The system has small static error and fast dynamic response with the new control method. This method is easy to realize in DSP and is suitable for full digital realization of UPS.

In the Chamber of Deputies, the centre-left Unione coalition emerged ahead of the centre-right Casa delle liberta` (House of Freedoms, Cdl) by just 24, 755 votes (though owing to the electoral law, the majority in terms of seats was a comfortable 66). In the Senate the Unione won just two seats more than the Cdl (and was behind by 124, 273 votes). 1 However, what was most striking about the outcome was less the sheer narrowness of the centreleft’s victory than the fact that what polls had suggested would be a certain triumph was instead an outcome that was uncertain until almost the last of the votes had been counted. 2 Explanations for the large divergence between poll predictions and votes cast will presumably be offered by polling experts in the weeks to come.
