40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} the biased {{behavior}} of investor in uptrend and/or downtrend market in Indonesian stock exchange. Behavioral bias is indicated by three variables: gambler 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fallacy,</b> halo effect, and familiarity effect. Data were collected using questionnaire and distributed to 384 respondents. First, questionnaires were analyzed using frequency distribution. Second, questionnaires were assessed using Likert scale and analyzed using one sample t-test and paired t-test to answer the hypothesis and research questions. The result shows that gambler 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fallacy</b> exists in investors when they trade in uptrend stock market, but {{does not exist in}} downtrend stock market. Halo effect does not exist when they trade in uptrend and downtrend stock market. Meanwhile, familiarity effect exists when they trade in uptrend and downtrend stock market. In uptrend stock market, familiarity effect was greater than that of the downtrend stock market. Based on the result, this research concluded that in general, investors in Indonesian stock market are irrational in decision making process. In the uptrend market, behavioral bias is potentially greater than that in the downtrend market as indicated by the occurrence of gambler 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fallacy</b> and familiarity effect. Meanwhile, in the downtrend market, the behavioral bias is indicated by familiarity effect.

Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa gambler 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fallacy</b> terjadi pada investor saat kondisi uptrend, tetapi tidak terjadi saat kondisi downtrend. Halo effect tidak terjadi pada investor, baik ketika kondisi uptrend dan downtrend. Sementara itu, familiarity effect terjadi pada investor saat kondisi uptrend dan downtrend. Familiarity effect terjadi lebih besar saat kondisi pasar modal mengalami uptrend. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian ini, secara umum, investor di pasar modal Indonesia mengambil keputusan secara irasional. Saat kondisi uptrend, perilaku bias berpeluang lebih besar terjadi dibandingkan saat kondisi downtrend, yang diindikasikan dengan terjadinya gambler 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fallacy</b> dan familiarity effect.

40|$|The gambler 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fallacy</b> (Rabin, 2002) {{predicts that}} trends bias {{investor}} expectations. Consistent with this prediction, {{we find that}} investors underreact to streaks of consecutive earnings surprises with the same sign. When the most recent earnings surprise extends a streak, post-earnings announcement drift is strong and significant. In contrast, the drift is negligible following thetermination of a streak. Indeed, streaks explain {{about half of the}} post-earnings announcement drift in our sample. Our results are robust to more general definitions of trends than streaks and a battery of control variables including the magnitude ofearnings surprises and their autocorrelation. Overall, post-earnings announcement drift has a significant time-series component that is consistent with the gambler 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fallacy...</b>|$|R

40|$|Reinforcement {{learning}} theory has generated substantial interest in neurobiology, particularly {{because of the}} resemblance between phasic dopamine and reward prediction errors. Actor-critic theories have been adapted {{to account for the}} functions of the striatum, with parts of the dorsal striatum equated to the actor. Here, we specifically test whether the human dorsal striatum-as predicted by an actor-critic instantiation-is used on a trial-to-trial basis at the time of choice to choose in accordance with reinforcement {{learning theory}}, as opposed to a competing strategy: the gambler 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fallacy.</b> Using a partial-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning protocol focused on the striatum and other ventral brain areas, we found that the dorsal striatum is more active when choosing consistent with reinforcement learning compared with the competing strategy. Moreover, an overlapping area of dorsal striatum along with the ventral striatum was found to be correlated with reward prediction errors at the time of outcome, as predicted by the actor-critic framework. These findings suggest that the same region of dorsal striatum involved in learning stimulus-response associations may contribute to the control of behavior during choice, thereby using those learned associations. Intriguingly, neither reinforcement learning nor the gambler 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fallacy</b> conformed to the optimal choice strategy on the specific decision-making task we used. Thus, the dorsal striatum may contribute to the control of behavior according to reinforcement learning even when the prescriptions of such an algorithm are suboptimal in terms of maximizing future rewards...|$|R
