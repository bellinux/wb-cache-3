5|$|The {{receptor}} for AtPep1 {{has been}} identified as a 170KDa LRR-RLK and has been named AtPEPR1. AtPep1 is active at 0.1 nano-molar (nM) concentrations and the receptor saturates at 1nM. An analysis {{of the structure of the}} AtPEPR1 receptor has shown that it is a member of the LRR XI subfamily of LRR-RLKs in A. thaliana which includes the receptor for another <b>peptide</b> <b>hormone</b> CLAVATA3. Transforming tobacco cell cultures with AtPEPR1 allowed them to respond to AtPep1 in an alkalisation assay, whereas normal tobacco did not show such a response. BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1) is an LRR-RLK found in A. thaliana, which has been proposed to function as an adaptor protein that is required for the proper functioning of other RLKs. Yeast two-hybrid assays have shown that AtPEPR1 and its closest analog, AtPEPR2, interact with BAK1.|$|E
5|$|Systemin is a plant <b>peptide</b> <b>hormone</b> {{involved}} in the wound response in the Solanaceae family. It was the first plant hormone that was {{proven to be a}} peptide having been isolated from tomato leaves in 1991 by a group led by Clarence A. Ryan. Since then other peptides, with similar functions have been identified in tomato and outside of the Solanaceae. Hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides were found in tobacco in 2001 and AtPEPs (Arabidopsis thaliana Plant Elicitor Peptides) were found in Arabidopsis thaliana in 2006. Their precursors are found both in the cytoplasm and cell walls of plant cells, upon insect damage, the precursors are processed to produce one or more mature peptides. The receptor for systemin was first thought to be the same as the brassinolide receptor but this is now uncertain. The signal transduction processes that occur after the peptides bind are similar to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. Early experiments showed that systemin travelled around the plant after insects had damaged the plant, activating systemic acquired resistance, now it is thought that it increases the production of jasmonic acid causing the same result. The main function of systemins is to coordinate defensive responses against insect herbivores but they also affect plant development. Systemin induces the production of protease inhibitors which protect against insect herbivores, other peptides activate defensins and modify root growth. They have also been shown to affect plants' responses to salt stress and UV radiation. AtPEPs have been shown to affect resistance against oomycetes and may allow A. thaliana to distinguish between different pathogens. In Nicotiana attenuata, some of the peptides have stopped being {{involved in}} defensive roles and instead affect flower morphology.|$|E

25|$|The stomach {{contains}} receptors {{that can}} detect {{the presence of}} nutrients, but there are detectors in the intestines as well, and the satiety factors of the stomach and intestines can interact. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a <b>peptide</b> <b>hormone</b> secreted by the duodenum that controls the rate of stomach emptying. CCK is secreted {{in response to the}} presence of fats, which are detected in by receptors in the duodenum.

25|$|Neprilysin-deficient {{knockout}} mice show both Alzheimer's-like behavioral {{impairment and}} amyloid-beta deposition in the brain, providing strong {{evidence for the}} protein's association with the Alzheimer's disease process. Because neprilysin {{is thought to be}} the rate-limiting step in amyloid beta degradation, it has been considered a potential therapeutic target; compounds such as the <b>peptide</b> <b>hormone</b> somatostatin have been identified that increase the enzyme's activity level. One hypothesis for the strong dependence of Alzheimer's incidence on age focuses on the declining production of somatostatin in the brains of elderly people, which thus depresses the activity of neprilysin and promotes aggregation of unprocessed amyloid beta. Declining neprilysin activity with increasing age may also be explained by oxidative damage, known to be a causative factor in Alzheimer's disease; higher levels of inappropriately oxidized neprilysin have been found in Alzheimer's patients compared to cognitively normal elderly people.|$|E
25|$|These {{intestinal}} lining {{cells can}} then either store the iron as ferritin, which {{is accomplished by}} Fe3+ binding to apoferritin (in which case the iron will leave the body when the cell dies and is sloughed off into feces), or the cell can release it into the body via the only known iron exporter in mammals, ferroportin. Hephaestin, a ferroxidase that can oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+ and is found mainly in the small intestine, helps ferroportin transfer iron across the basolateral end of the intestine cells. In contrast, ferroportin is post-translationally repressed by hepcidin, a 25-amino acid <b>peptide</b> <b>hormone.</b> The body regulates iron levels by regulating each of these steps. For instance, enterocytes synthesize more Dcytb, DMT1 and ferroportin in response to iron deficiency anemia. Iron absorption from diet is enhanced {{in the presence of}} vitamin C and diminished by excess calcium, zinc, or manganese.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{key role}} Ca 2 + {{plays in the}} nervous system, {{biochemical}} actions on neural tissue of the Ca 2 +-regulating <b>peptide</b> <b>hormones</b> parathyrin and calcitonin were unknown. Until {{a few years ago}} only neurons, but not glial cells, were considered as targets for <b>peptide</b> <b>hormones.</b> Our recent observation that <b>peptide</b> <b>hormones</b> do indeed act on glial cells is extended by the present report that these cells respond to the calcaemic <b>peptide</b> <b>hormones</b> parathyrin and calcitonin. In cultured murine brain cells mainly consisting of glioblasts, parathyrin stimulates the accumulation of cyclic AMP. The half-maximal effect is elicited at 30 nM parathyrin. With rat brain cells the effects are three times those observed with mouse brain cells. Calcitonin, which is less potent than parathyrin, elevates the concentration of cyclic AMP only in rat brain cells. If properly occupied, the inhibitory receptors present on the cells lower the increase in the level of cyclic AMP evoked by parathyrin and, to some extent, that elicited by calcitonin. The results suggest that: (i) these or closely related hormones might exert regulatory functions in brain; and (ii) glial cells must be considered in discussions of the targets of the calcaemic and other <b>peptide</b> <b>hormones...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Insulin (from the Latin, insula meaning island) is a <b>peptide</b> <b>hormone</b> {{produced}} by beta {{cells of the}} pancreatic islets, and it {{is considered to be}} the main anabolic hormone of the body.

[...] In these tissues the absorbed glucose is converted into either glycogen via glycogenesis or fats (triglycerides) via lipogenesis, or, {{in the case of the}} liver, into both. [...] Glucose production and secretion by the liver is strongly inhibited by high concentrations of insulin in the blood. Circulating insulin also affects the synthesis of proteins in a wide variety of tissues. It is therefore an anabolic hormone, promoting the conversion of small molecules in the blood into large molecules inside the cells. Low insulin levels in the blood have the opposite effect by promoting widespread catabolism.|$|E
