2500|$|Some methods melt or {{soften the}} {{material}} to produce the layers. In Fused filament fabrication, also known as Fused deposition modeling (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head (3D printer extruder), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Laser sintering techniques include selective laser sintering, with both metals and polymers, and direct metal laser sintering. Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. titanium alloys). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder (plaster, or resins) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With laminated object manufacturing, thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. [...] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30µm) until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs. In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a <b>photocurable</b> liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it {{in the shape of the}} layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the [...] "window"), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. [...] In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment.|$|E

5000|$|Before {{the free}} radical nature of certain polymerizations was determined, certain {{monomers}} were observed to polymerize {{when exposed to}} light. The first to demonstrate the photoinduced free radical chain reaction of vinyl bromide was Ivan Ostromislensky, a Russian chemist who also studied the polymerization of synthetic rubber. Subsequently, many compounds were found to become dissociated by light and found immediate use as photoinitiators in the polymerization industry. In the free radical mechanism of radiation curable systems light absorbed by a photoinitiator generates free-radicals which induce cross-linking reactions of a mixture of functionalized oligomers and monomers to generate the cured film [...] <b>Photocurable</b> materials that form through the free-radical mechanism undergo chain-growth polymerization, which includes three basic steps: initiation, chain propagation, and chain termination. The three steps are depicted in the scheme below, where R• represents the radical that forms upon interaction with radiation during initiation, and M is a monomer. [...] The active monomer that is formed is then propagated to create growing polymeric chain radicals. In <b>photocurable</b> materials the propagation step involves reactions of the chain radicals with reactive double bonds of the prepolymers or oligomers. The termination reaction usually proceeds through combination, in which two chain radicals are joined together, or through disproportionation, which occurs when an atom (typically hydrogen) is transferred from one radical chain to another resulting in two polymeric chains.|$|E

5000|$|The {{properties}} of a photocured material, such as flexibility, adhesion, and chemical resistance {{are provided by}} the functionalized oligomers present in the <b>photocurable</b> composite. Oligomers are typically epoxides, urethanes, polyethers, or polyesters, each of which provide specific properties to the resulting material. Each of these oligomers are typically functionallized by an acrylate. An example shown below is an epoxy oligomer that has been functionalized by acrylic acid. Acrylated epoxies are useful as coatings on metallic substrates, and result in glossy hard coatings. Acrylated urethane oligomers are typically abrasion resistant, tough, and flexible making ideal coatings for floors, paper, printing plates, and packaging materials. Acrylated polyethers and polyesters result in very hard solvent resistant films, however, polyethers are prone to UV degradation and therefore are rarely used in UV curable material.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Microfluidic {{devices are}} {{instrumental}} {{in a variety}} of scientific and biomedical applications. These devices have revolutionized scientific research in areas ranging from cancer diagnostics to drug discovery and neuroscience. Microfluidic devices are broadly classified as active and passive devices. Passive devices constitute micro flow channels, flow splitters, reaction chambers, gradient generators and mixers. Active devices are essentially microfluidic valves and pumps which allow microfluidic automation. All of the microfluidic devices have traditionally been manufactured using a manufacturing process called soft lithography with a transparent, elastomeric and biocompatible material called poly-dimethyl siloxane (PDMS). Soft lithography is based on PDMS micromolding and it is extremely labor intensive, expensive, and cannot produce complex devices with high yield. That is why many researchers have recently published studies utilizing stereolithography (SL) to manufacture passive microfluidic devices. SL simplifies the complexity of soft lithography and improves the manufacturability of microfluidic devices. However, to date SL has lacked the valving functionality of soft lithography and thus, active microfluidic devices are not shown to be produced using SL. Thus, this research focuses on overcoming the current limitations in manufacturing active microfluidic devices using SL. PDMS like elastomeric resins are essential for active microfluidic device manufacturing using SL. The first part of this research explores, characterizes and optimizes the current commercially available elastomeric SL resin. The optical analysis of the SL microfluidic device manufacturing process is understood using a mathematical model. The limitations of the existing resins are identified. A definite need to synthesize a <b>photocurable</b> PDMS resin for SL is established. The second part of the research develops a chemistry to synthesize <b>photocurable</b> PDMS resin for SL. A highly customized projection stereolithography system using open source electronics is constructed to overcome the limitations of commercial systems.

It is proved that the parts made with <b>photocurable</b> PDMS resin using stereolithography are equally transparent as that of parts made using soft lithography and both the parts have Young’s modulus in the same range. Unavailability of PDMS like resin was a major roadblock impeding the use of SL for active microfluidic device manufacturing.

Each layer of coating consisted of liquid prepolymer/monomer and powdered solid pore-forming agents. Using lactose as a pore-forming agent, optimum ratio of the amount of pore-forming agent in mg (S) to volume of <b>photocurable</b> prepolymer/monomer in μl (L) to achieve good process efficiency and uniformity was 1. 8 - 3. 0. The S/L ratio was sensitive to particle size and type of pore-forming agent as well as the viscosity of the monomer mixture in the case of the visible light curable coating system. Initiator (and photo-sensitizer in visible light curing system) concentration, exposure time, light intensity and total exposure of light were also evaluated and were shown to influence the percent conversion of prepolymer/monomer to polymer. Immediate release of a blue dye contained in the non-pareils was obtained for both UV and visible light curing system with sodium starch glycolate as a pore-former, since it swelled producing large pores. Simple pore-formers (lactose and sodium chloride) simply dissolved away and provided a more sustained release profile. Release from the coating was modifiable with the choice of pore-forming agent, number of layers, coating thickness as well as mixing two groups of non-pareils coated with different pore-forming agents. The nature of the scaffold and pore structure of the coating were determined by simultaneously monitoring the release of sodium chloride from the coating and the blue dye from the beads. At least 40 - 50 % of the sodium chloride that was incorporated in the coating released before the dye released through the coating showing that pore-formation was a necessary process prior to the release of the marker dye. The coupling between dye release and pore-formation was found to be dependent on the S/L ratio of the coating. Simulation based on percolation theory showed that the coupling of pore-formation and dye release was higher when the variance in tortuosity was lower. Additional studies demonstrated that the coating was photostable and could withstand handling stress. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this study, bentonite/polyacrylamide hybrid hydrogels were {{prepared}} via free radical polymerization of acrylamide (AM) with <b>photocurable</b> poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate(PEGDMA) as cross-linkers under UV irradiation. The {{structure of the}} hydrogels was characterized by FTIR, DTA techniques. Both single factor and orthogonal design experiments were adopted to investigate the swelling kinetics of the hydrogels. The effect of AM, PEGDMA, bentonite, photoinitiator on the swelling ratios was studied in detail. The as-prepared hydrogels could {{find a lot of}} applications in biomaterials...|$|E

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{describes a}} convenient method for the fabrication of freestanding, microperforated membranes in <b>photocurable</b> polymers using only one step of photolithography. We used photosensitive prepolymers {{to make the}} membranes and photolithography to define the micropatterns. We demonstrated the fabrication of single- and multilayer microperforated membranes in SU- 8 photoresist and Norland Optical Adhesive prepolymer. These membranes {{can be used to}} pattern surfaces in various materials and to fabricate complex three-dimensional microfluidic channel structures. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of hyperbranched {{polymers}} (HBP) was synthesized and investigated as additives in cationic photopolymerization of epoxy systems. The HBP were inserted into the polymeric network either by a copolymerization or through a chain transfer reaction involving the phenolic hydroxyl groups. By varying the type and concentration of HBP a modification of the bulk properties of photocured films was induced. An increase of toughness properties together with a flexibilization was obtained without affecting the processability and the viscosity of the <b>photocurable</b> mixture. In the presence of fluorine-containing HBP, a surface modification was induce...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{in-layer}} {{electro optical}} switch has been prepared by selectively curing a <b>photocurable</b> optical polymer with a UV laser. The {{core of the}} device is a NOA- 81 multimode waveguide grown by selective laser curing. The cladding is a positive calamitic liquid crystal, which allows tunability and switching of the waveguide by external driving electric signals. The effective refractive index in the guide changes upon switching the liquid crystal. Depending on the geometry, this setup leads to an electrooptical modulator or a switch between two levels of transmitted ligh...|$|E
