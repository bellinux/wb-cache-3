60|$|Just {{the other}} day I was witness to a second scene, in which the motive was {{something}} similar; only this time with quite common children, and in the familiar neighbourhood of Hampstead. A little congregation had formed itself in the lane underneath my window, and was busy over a skipping-rope. There were two sisters, from seven to nine perhaps, with dark faces and dark hair, and slim, lithe, little figures clad in lilac frocks. The elder of these two was mistress {{of the art of}} skipping. She was just and adroit in every movement; the rope passed over her black head and under her scarlet-stockinged legs with a precision and regularity that was like machinery; but there was nothing mechanical in the infinite variety and sweetness of her inclinations, and the spontaneous agile flexure of her lean waist and hips. There was one variation favourite with her, in which she crossed her hands before her with a motion not unlike that of weaving, which was admirably intricate and complete. And when the two took the rope together and whirled in and out with occasional interruptions, there was something Italian in the type of both--in the length of nose, in the slimness and accuracy of the shapes--and something gay and harmonious in the double movement, that added to the whole scene a southern element, and took me over sea and land into distant and beautiful places. Nor was this impression lessened when the elder girl took in her arms a fair-headed baby, while the others held the rope for her, turned and gyrated, and went in and out over it lightly, with a quiet regularity that seemed as if it might go on for ever. Somehow, incongruous as was the occupation, she reminded me of Italian Madonnas. And now, as before in the hotel drawing-room, the humorous element was to be introduced; only this time it was in broad farce. The funniest little girl, with a mottled complexion and a big, damaged nose, and looking {{for all the world like}} any dirty, broken-nosed doll in a nursery lumber-room, came forward to take her turn. While the others swung the rope for her as gently as it could be done--a mere mockery of movement--and playfully taunted her timidity, she <b>passaged</b> backwards and forwards in a pretty flutter of indecision, putting up her shoulders and laughing with the embarrassed laughter of children by the water's edge, eager to bathe and yet fearful. There never was anything at once so droll and so pathetic. One did not know whether to laugh or to cry. And when at last she had made an end of all her deprecations and drawings back, and summoned up heart enough to straddle over the rope, one leg at a time, it was a sight to see her ruffle herself up like a peacock and go away down the lane with her damaged nose, seeming to think discretion the better part of valour, and rather uneasy lest they should ask her to repeat the exploit. Much as I had enjoyed the grace of the older girls, it was now just as it had been before in France, and the clumsiness of the child seemed to have a significance and a sort of beauty of its own, quite above this grace of the others in power to affect the heart. I had looked on with a certain sense of balance and completion at the silent, rapid, masterly evolutions of the eldest; I had been pleased by these in the way of satisfaction. But when little broken-nose began her pantomime of indecision I grew excited. There was something quite fresh and poignant in the delight I took in her imperfect movements. I remember, for instance, that I moved my own shoulders, as if to imitate her; really, I suppose, with an inarticulate wish to help her out.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fact that}} NS1 is {{involved}} in the pathogenicity of influenza A viruses makes it a good target to attenuate these viruses.

[...] Although it had been known {{for more than a decade}} that influenza viruses with partial deletions in NS1 proteins were attenuated, all but one NS1 truncation variants of influenza A viruses were generated by in vitro mutagenesis.

5000|$|Many PDTX {{models have}} been {{successfully}} established for breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, and many other cancers because there are distinctive advantages when using PDTX over CCL for drug safety and efficacy studies as well as predicting patient tumor response to certain anti-cancer agents. [...] Since PDTX can be <b>passaged</b> without in vitro processing steps, PDTX models allow the propagation and expansion of patient tumors without significant genetic transformation of tumor cells over multiple murine generations. [...] Within PDTX models, patient tumor samples grow in physiologically-relevant tumor microenvironments that mimic the oxygen, nutrient, and hormone levels that {{are found in the}} patient’s primary tumor site. Furthermore, implanted tumor tissue maintains the genetic and epigenetic abnormalities found in the patient and the xenograft tissue can be excised from the patient to include the surrounding human stroma. [...] As a result, numerous studies have found that PDTX models exhibit similar responses to anti-cancer agents as seen in the actual patient who provided the tumor sample. PDTX models are beneficial to use to study therapeutic responses to drugs because multiple therapies can be tested against one biopsy and pre- and post-treatment data can be acquired from the human biopsy and xenograft tissues, potentially sparing a patient from therapies that may not work.|$|E
5000|$|Conventional {{cell culture}} {{technology}} {{is unable to}} efficiently allow combinatorial testing of drug candidates, growth factors, neuropeptides, genes, and retroviruses in cell culture medium. Due {{to the need for}} cells to be fed periodically with fresh medium and <b>passaged,</b> even testing a few conditions requires a large number of cells and supplies, expensive and bulky incubators, large fluid volumes (~0.1 - 2 mL per sample), and tedious human labour. The requirement of human labour also limits the number and length between time points for experiments. Microfluidic cell cultures are potentially a vast improvement because they can be automated, as well as yield lower overall cost, higher throughput, and more quantitative descriptions of single-cell behaviour variability. By including gas exchange and temperature control systems on chip, microfluidic cell culturing can eliminate the need for incubators and tissue culture hoods. [...] However, this type of continuous microfluidic cell culture operation presents its own unique challenges as well. Flow control is important when seeding cells into microchannels because flow needs to be stopped after the initial injection of cell suspension for cells to attach or become trapped in microwells, dielectrophoretic traps, micromagnetic traps, or hydrodynamic traps. Subsequently, flow needs to be resumed {{in a way that does}} not produce large forces that shear the cells off the substrate. Dispensing fluids by manual or robotic pipetting can be replaced with micropumps and microvalves, where fluid metering is straightforward to determine as opposed to continuous flow systems by micromixers. A fully automated microfluidic cell culture system has been developed to study osteogenic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells. A handheld microfluidic cell culture incubator capable of heating and pumping cell culture solutions has also been developed. Due to the volume reduction in microfluidic cultures, the collected concentrations are higher for better signal-to-noise ratio measurements, but collection and detection is correspondingly more difficult. In situ microscopy assays with microfluidic cell cultures may help in this regard, but have inherently lower throughput due to the microscope probe having only a small field of view. Micropatterned co-cultures have also contributed to bio-MEMS for tissue engineering to recapitulate in vivo conditions and 3D natural structure. Specifically, hepatocytes have been patterned to co-culture at specific cell densities with fibroblasts to maintain liver-specific functions such as albumin secretion, urea synthesis, and p450 detoxification. Similarly, integrating microfluidics with micropatterned co-cultures has enabled modelling of organs where multiple vascularized tissues interface, such as the blood-brain barrier and the lungs. Organ-level lung functions have been reconstituted on lung-on-a-chip devices where a porous membrane and the seeded epithelial cell layer are cyclically stretched by applied vacuum on adjacent microchannels to mimic inhalation.|$|E

40|$|In {{information}} retrieval, retrieving relevant <b>passages,</b> {{as opposed}} to whole documents, not only directly benefits the end user by filtering out the irrelevant information within a long relevant document, but also improves retrieval accuracy in general. A critical problem in <b>passage</b> retrieval is to extract coherent relevant <b>passages</b> accurately from a document, which we refer to as <b>passage</b> extraction. While much {{work has been done}} on <b>passage</b> retrieval, the <b>passage</b> extraction problem has not been seriously studied. Most existing work tends to rely on presegmenting documents into fixed-length <b>passages</b> which are unlikely optimal because the length of a relevant <b>passage</b> is presumably highly sensitive to both the query and document. In this article, we present a new method for accurately detecting coherent relevant <b>passages</b> of variable lengths using hidden Markov models (HMMs). The HMM-based method naturally captures the topical boundaries between <b>passages</b> relevant and nonrelevant to the query. Pseudo-feedback mechanisms can be naturally incorporated into such an HMM-based framework to improve param...|$|R
