40|$|Abstract: Emerging {{technology}} in mobile communications is seeing increasingly high acceptance as a preferred choice for last-mile communication. There {{have been a}} wide range of techniques to achieve signal compression to suit to the smaller bandwidths available on mobile communication channels; but speech recognition methods have seen success mostly only in controlled speech environments. However, designing of speech recognition systems for mobile communications is crucial in order to provide voice enabled command and control and for applications like Mobile Voice Commerce. Continuously Variable Slope Delta (CVSD) modulation, a technique for low bitrate coding of speech, has been in use particularly in military wireless environments for over 30 years, and is now also adopted by BlueTooth. CVSD is particularly suitable for Internet and mobile environments due to its robustness against transmission errors, and simplicity of implementation and the absence of a need for synchronization. In this paper, we study some characteristics of the CVSD speech in the context of robust recognition of compressed speech, and present two methods of improving the recognition accuracy in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. We study the characteristics of the features extracted for ASR and how they relate to the corresponding features computed from <b>Pulse</b> <b>Coded</b> <b>Modulation</b> (<b>PCM)</b> speech and apply this relation to correct the CVSD features to improve recognition accuracy.

5000|$|The Highgate Wood Electronic Exchange {{had been}} the result of six years {{co-operative}} research and development between the Post Office and five principal British manufacturers of exchange equipment. This was coordinated through the Joint Electronic Research Committee(JERC). Although different contractors had been responsible for the system design, installation and manufacturing of various sections of the exchange, the commissioning {{had been the}} work of teams drawn from each of the parties to the Agreement. The Highgate Wood Exchange was not entirely typical of the systems which were to follow it. Each of the three new exchanges, all of which were to operate completely on their own, with no stand-by exchange as was the case at Highgate Wood, were to be designed to try out actual service conditions. Two of them were based on slightly different applications of the time-division pulse-amplitude modulation (TDM) principle, and the third, at Leighton Buzzard, on space-division switching. All three were to be fully transistorised so that they were going be more compact than Highgate Wood (which had about 5000 transistors and 500 valves) and would have needed less power. They were also expected to show a significant improvement in reliability that had been a problem at Highgate Wood.

5000|$|From the {{introduction}} of voice encryption to today, encryption techniques have evolved drastically. Digital technology has effectively replaced old analog methods of voice encryption and by using complex algorithms, voice encryption {{has become much more}} secure and efficient. One relatively modern voice encryption method is Sub-band coding. With Sub-band Coding, the voice signal is split into multiple frequency bands, using multiple bandpass filters that cover specific frequency ranges of interest. The output signals from the bandpass filters are then lowpass translated to reduce the bandwidth, which reduces the sampling rate. The lowpass signals are then quantized and encoded using special techniques like, <b>Pulse</b> <b>Code</b> <b>Modulation</b> (<b>PCM).</b> After the encoding stage, the signals are multiplexed and sent out along the communication network. When the signal reaches the receiver, the inverse operations are applied to the signal to get it back to its original state. A speech scrambling system was developed at Bell Laboratories in the 1970s by Subhash Kak and Nikil Jayant. In this system permutation matrices were used to scramble coded representations (such as Pulse Code Modulation and variants) of the speech data. Motorola developed a voice encryption system called Digital Voice Protection (DVP) as part of their first generation of voice encryption techniques. DVP uses a self-synchronizing encryption technique known as cipher feedback (CFB). The basic DVP algorithm is capable of 2.36 x 1021 different [...] "keys" [...] based on a key length of 32 bits." [...] The extremely high number of possible keys associated with the early DVP algorithm, makes the algorithm very robust and gives a high level of security. As with other symmetric keyed encryption systems, the encryption key is required to decrypt the signal with a special decryption algorithm.|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{presents}} {{results on}} optimal coding and decoding of discrete-time stochastic signals, {{in the sense}} of minimizing a distortion metric subject to a constraint on the bit-rate and on the signal transfer function from source to reconstruction. The first (preliminary) contribution of this thesis is the introduction of new distortion metric that extends the mean squared error (MSE) criterion. We give this extension the name Weighted-Correlation MSE (WCMSE), and use it as the distortion metric throughout the thesis. The WCMSE is a weighted sum of two components of the MSE: the variance of the error component uncorrelated to the source, on the one hand, and the remainder of the MSE, on the other. The WCMSE can take account of signal transfer function constraints by assigning a larger weight to deviations from a target signal transfer function than to source-uncorrelated distortion. Within this framework, the second contribution is the solution of a family of feedback quantizer design problems for wide sense stationary sources using an additive noise model for quantization errors. These associated problems consist of finding the frequency response of the filters deployed around a scalar quantizer that minimize the WCMSE for a fixed quantizer signal-to-(granular) -noise ratio (SNR). This general structure, which incorporates pre-, post-, and feedback filters, includes as special cases well known source coding schemes such as <b>pulse</b> <b>coded</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>PCM),</b> Differential Pulse-Coded <b>Modulation</b> (DPCM), Sigma Delta converters, and noise-shaping coders. The optimal frequency response of each of the filters in this architecture is found for each possible subset of the remaining filters being given and fixed. These results are then applied to oversampled feedback quantization. In particular, it is shown that, within the linear model used, and for a fixed quantizer SNR, the MSE decays exponentially with oversampling ratio, provided optimal filters are used at each oversampling ratio. If a subtractively dithered quantizer is utilized, then the noise model is exact, and the SNR constraint can be directly related to the bit-rate if entropy coding is used, regardless of the number of quantization levels. On the other hand, in the case of fixed-rate quantization, the SNR is related to the number of quantization levels, and hence to the bit-rate, when overload errors are negligible. It is shown that, for sources with unbounded support, the latter condition is violated for sufficiently large oversampling ratios. By deriving an upper bound on the contribution of overload errors to the total WCMSE, a lower bound for the decay rate of the WCMSE {{as a function of the}} oversampling ratio is found for fixed-rate quantization of sources with finite or infinite support. The third main contribution of the thesis is the introduction of the rate-distortion function (RDF) when WCMSE is the distortion metric, denoted by WCMSE-RDF. We provide a complete characterization for Gaussian sources. The resulting WCMSE-RDF yields, as special cases, Shannon's RDF, as well as the recently introduced RDF for source-uncorrelated distortions (RDF-SUD). For cases where only source-uncorrelated distortion is allowed, the RDF-SUD is extended to include the possibility of linear-time invariant feedback between reconstructed signal and coder input. It is also shown that feedback quantization schemes can achieve a bit-rate only 0. 254 bits/sample above this RDF by using the same filters that minimize the reconstruction MSE for a quantizer-SNR constraint. The fourth main contribution of this thesis is to provide a set of conditions under which knowledge of a realization of the RDF can be used directly to solve encoder-decoder design optimization problems. This result has direct implications in the design of subband coders with feedback, as well as in the design of encoder-decoder pairs for applications such as networked control. As the fifth main contribution of this thesis, the RDF-SUD is utilized to show that, for Gaussian sta-tionary sources with memory and MSE distortion criterion, an upper bound on the information-theoretic causal RDF can be obtained by means of an iterative numerical procedure, at all rates. This bound is tighter than 0 : 5 bits/sample. Moreover, if there exists a realization of the causal RDF in which the re-construction error is jointly stationary with the source, then the bound obtained coincides with the causal RDF. The iterative procedure proposed here to obtain Ritc(D) also yields a characterization of the filters in a scalar feedback quantizer having an operational rate that exceeds the bound by less than 0 : 254 bits/sample. This constitutes an upper bound on the optimal performance theoretically attainable by any causal source coder for stationary Gaussian sources under the MSE distortion criterion...|$|R
