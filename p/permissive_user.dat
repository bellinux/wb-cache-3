40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{controversy}} surrounding the 2 ̆ 2 frolic and detour 2 ̆ 2 doctrine, looks at the Restatement (Second) of Agency position on the question, and examines a standard of automobile insurance policy containing the <b>permissive</b> <b>user</b> clause. Next, {{the results of an}} empirical test of whether the frequency of litigation has decreased in the 2 ̆ 2 frolic and detour 2 ̆ 2 area is presented...|$|E
40|$|User {{interfaces}} {{often only}} support {{one way to}} do a task when the physical interface or the requirements of the task would permit other ways. In contrast, a user interface that supports multiple approaches is permissive. This paper argues that <b>permissive</b> <b>user</b> interfaces are easier to use — and even when they are not applicable for particular applications, considering permissiveness is a productive design heuristic. Many user interfaces are difficult to use yet very easily demonstrated or explained by experts — with the result that users become frustrated because hindsight makes usability problems look like the users ’ own fault. The lack of permissiveness in such user interfaces explains this paradox...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} the increasingly occurring situations where 2 ̆ 2 step-down 2 ̆ 2 clauses are inserted in auto policies to defeat coverage for particular classes of claimants. The article {{points out that}} step-down clauses that reduce the recovery of family members to minimum limits and protection of <b>permissive</b> <b>users</b> to minimum limits are subject to challenge for being unfair, unconscionable, violative of public policy, violative of reasonable expectations, and for creating ambiguity in an auto policy, and as such, need to be scrutinized by the Montana Supreme Court...|$|R
40|$|There {{is still}} {{widespread}} confusion over copyright and open licensing {{in relation to}} academic research outputs. Anne Barron addresses the uncertainty by disentangling the four regimes of authors’ rights. Just because the concept of open access requires licensing to be <b>permissive</b> for <b>users</b> of published research doesn’t mean that it requires the other regimes to be permissive too. Unlike copyrights, moral rights cannot be licensed away...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we focus}} on {{distributed}} systems sub ject to security issues. Such systems are usually composed of two entities: a high level user and a low level user that can both do some actions. The security properties we consider are non-interference properties. A system is non-interferent if the low level user cannot deduce any information by playing its low level actions. Various notions of non-interference have been defined in the literature, and in this paper {{we focus on}} two of them: one trace-based property (SNNI) and another bisimulation-based property (BSNNI). For these properties we study the problems of synthesis of a high level user so that the system is non-interferent. We prove that a most <b>permissive</b> high level <b>user</b> can be computed when one exists...|$|R
