5|$|Amanita muscaria {{was widely}} {{used as an}} entheogen {{by many of the}} {{indigenous}} <b>peoples</b> of Siberia. Its use was known among almost all of the Uralic-speaking <b>peoples</b> of western Siberia and the Paleosiberian-speaking <b>peoples</b> of the Russian Far East. There are only isolated reports of A.muscaria use among the Tungusic and Turkic <b>peoples</b> of central Siberia and it is believed that on the whole entheogenic use of A.muscaria was not practised by these <b>peoples.</b> In western Siberia, the use of A.muscaria was restricted to shamans, who used it as an alternative method of achieving a trance state. (Normally, Siberian shamans achieve trance by prolonged drumming and dancing.) In eastern Siberia, A.muscaria was used by both shamans and laypeople alike, and was used recreationally as well as religiously. In eastern Siberia, the shaman would take the mushrooms, and others would drink his urine. This urine, still containing psychoactive elements, may be more potent than the A.muscaria mushrooms with fewer negative effects such as sweating and twitching, suggesting that the initial user may act as a screening filter for other components in the mushroom.|$|E
