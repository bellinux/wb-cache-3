40|$|Chymosin (Rennin EC 3. 4. 23. 4), an aspartyl pro-teinase, is {{the major}} {{proteolytic}} enzyme in the fourth stomach of the unweaned calf, and it is formed by pro-teolytic activation of its zymogene, prochymosin. Following the cloning of synthesized cDNAs on mRNA pools extracted from the mucosa of the calf fourth stomach, we have identified an alternatively spliced form of <b>preprochymosin</b> cDNA (AS 6 <b>preprochymosin).</b> Sequencing data analysis showed that the exon six has been spliced out and, therefore the gene product is 114 bp shorter in length. In {{order to determine the}} biological significance of the AS 6 <b>preprochymosin,</b> we expressed the encoding cDNA together with a com-plete chymosin cDNA in E. coli. Under the same expression conditions, we found at least a 5 -fold high-er expression of AS 6 <b>preprochymosin</b> protein in com-parison to a full-length recombinant chymosin. Protein prediction program analyses showed that the missing exon contain groups of amino acids with high hydrophobicity score. Therefore, the deletion of this exon may explain the higher expression of the recom-binant product in E. coli. Most importantly, the biologi-cal activity of the purified AS 6 <b>preprochymosin,</b> was confirmed in an assay of chymosin milk-clotting activi-ty using the recombinant <b>preprochymosin</b> and com-mercial rennet as positive controls. The expression of the biologically active <b>preprochymosin</b> lacking exon 6 may have important implications on the existence of this splicing form of mRNA in vivo and on its biotech-nological applications in cheese manufacture...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Chymosin (Rennin EC 3. 4. 23. 4) is an aspartyl proteinas (the major proteolyticenzyme in {{the fourth}} stomach of the {{unweaned}} calf) that is formed by proteolytic activation fromzymogene prochymosin. The aim of his study was to produce the full length and splicing form ofchymosin using pETexpression system in E-coli and to assay the activity of expressed enzyme andpreplasmic secretion. Materials and Methods: The sense primer F-prochy(+) (5 ´-ggggccatgGCTGAGATCACCAGGA) including NCOI restriction site). The anti sense R-prochy(-) (5 ´-gggcggccgcGATGGCTTTGGCCAGC - 3 ´) hybridizing to the C-terminal end of calf preprocymosincDNA and contains an additional NotI restriction site at its 5 ´-end. The cells were disrupted bysonication and proteins were purified by using Ni-NTA beads from Qiagen under native conditional. The <b>preprochymosin</b> and AS 6 <b>preprochymosin</b> were activated at pH 4. 7. The enzyme solutions werediluted 20 -fold with 50 mM phosphate buffer. Results: Sequencing data analysis showed that the exon six has been spliced out and, therefore thegene product is 114 bp shorter in length, both chymosin forms were expressed together in E. coli. Under the same expression conditions, at least AS 6 <b>preprochymosin</b> was produced 7 -fold highexpression in comparison to a full-length recombinant chymosin. Following acid activation andneutralization, the purified fractions were tested in a qualitative milk clotting assay. The clottingactivity of <b>preprochymosin</b> and exon 6 -less <b>preprochymosin</b> were comparable. Conclusion: High expression of this alternatively expressed transcript in bacteria, and properfolding of the AS 6 chymosin protein molecule {{in the absence of}} exon six are the two most importantaspects distinguished in this research...|$|E
40|$|Rennet, {{a complex}} of enzymes found in the stomachs of ruminants, is an {{important}} component for cheese production. In our study, we described that yak chymosin gene recombinant Pichia pastoris strain could serve as a novel source for rennet production. Yaks total RNA was extracted from the abomasum of an unweaned yak. The yak <b>preprochymosin,</b> prochymosin, and chymosin genes from total RNA were isolated using gene specific primers based on cattle chymosin gene sequence respectively and analyzed their expression pattern byreal time-polymerase chain reaction. The result showed that the chymosin gene expression level of the sucking yaks was 11. 45 times higher than one of adult yaks and yak chymosin belongs to Bovidae family in phylogenetic analysis. To express each, the <b>preprochymosin,</b> prochymosin, and chymosin genes were ligated into the expression vector pPICZαA, respectively, and were expressed in Pichia pastoris X 33. The results showed that all the recombinant clones of P. pastoris containing the <b>preprochymosin,</b> prochymosin or chymosin genes could produce the active form of recombinant chymosin into the culture supernatant. Heterologous expressed prochymosin (14. 55 Soxhlet unit/mL) had the highest enzyme activity of the three expressed chymosin enzymes. Therefore, we suggest that the yak chymosin gene recombinant Pichia pastoris strain could provide an alternative source of rennet production...|$|E
40|$|A {{gene for}} calf {{prochymosin}} (prorennin) has been reconstructed from chemically synthesized oligodeoxyribonucleotides and cloned DNA copies of <b>preprochymosin</b> mRNA. This gene has been inserted into a bacterial expression plasmid containing the Escherichia coli tryptophan promoter and a bacterial ribosome binding site. Induction of transcription from the tryptophan promoter results in prochymosin synthesis {{at a level}} of up to 5 % of total protein. The enzyme has been purified from bacteria by extraction with urea and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and converted to enzymatically active chymosin by acidification and neutralization. Bacterially produced chymosin is as effective in clotting milk as the natural enzyme isolated from calf stomach...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{complementary}} to calf stomach mRNA {{has been}} synthesised and {{inserted into the}} Pst 1 site of pAT 153 by G-C tailing. Clones containing sequences coding for prochymosin were recognised by colony hybridisation with cDNA extended from a chemically synthesised oligodeoxynucleotide primer, the sequence of which was predicted from the published amino acid sequence of calf prochymosin. Two clones were identified which together contained a complete copy of prochymosin mRNA. The nucleotide sequence is in substantial agreement with the reported amino acid sequence of prochymosin and shows that this protein has a mol. wt. of 40431 and chymosin a mol. wt. of 35612. The sequence also indicates that prochymosin is synthesised as a precursor molecule, <b>preprochymosin,</b> having a 16 amino acid hydrophobic leader sequence analogous to that reported for other secreted proteins...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic RNAs coding {{for chicken}} lysozyme, calf <b>preprochymosin</b> and Xenopus globin were {{transcribed}} in vitro using Sp 6 RNA polymerase. The effects of capping and adding a poly(A) tail on the stability, movement and translation of these RNAs in Xenopus oocytes was examined. Capping and polyadenylation increased {{stability of the}} transcripts, with at least 40 % remaining intact 48 h after injection into oocytes. Capped poly(A) - transcripts moved more rapidly in oocytes than either capped poly(A) + transcripts or naturally occurring mRNAs. The translational efficiency {{of most of the}} synthetic RNAs in oocytes increased with both capping and polyadenylation. The exception was one Xenopus globin transcript which had an unusual 3 ' end of 20 As and 30 Cs, where further polyadenylation decreased translational efficiency. Polyadenylation was essential for detectable expression of the synthetic RNAs in cultured cells, but decreased translation of the synthetic RNAs in vitro...|$|E
40|$|Chymosin (also {{known as}} rennin) plays an {{essential}} role in the coagulation of milk in the cheese industry. Chymosin is traditionally extracted from the rumen of calves and is of high cost. Here, we present an alternative method to producing bovine chymosin from transgenic tobacco plants. The CYM gene, which encodes a <b>preprochymosin</b> from bovine, was introduced into the tobacco nuclear genome under control of the viral 35 S cauliflower mosaic promoter. The integration and transcription of the foreign gene were confirmed with Southern blotting and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analyses, respectively. Immunoblotting analyses were performed to demonstrate expression of chymosin, and the expression level was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results indicated recombinant bovine chymosin was successfully expressed at an average level of 83. 5 ng/g fresh weight, which is 0. 52 % of the total soluble protein. The tobacco-derived chymosin exhibited similar native milk coagulation bioactivity as the commercial product extracted from bovine rumen...|$|E
40|$|Unfolded-protein {{response}} (UPR) {{denotes the}} upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -resident chaperone and foldase genes {{and numerous other}} genes involved in secretory functions during the accumulation of unfolded proteins into the ER. Overexpression of individual foldases and chaperones {{has been used in}} attempts to improve protein production in different production systems. We describe here a novel strategy to improve foreign-protein production. We show that the constitutive induction of the UPR pathway in Aspergillus niger var. awamori can be achieved by expressing the activated form of the transcription factor hacA. This induction enhances the production of Trametes versicolor laccase by up to sevenfold and of bovine <b>preprochymosin</b> by up to 2. 8 -fold in this biotechnically important fungus. The regulatory range of UPR was studied by analyzing the mRNA levels of novel A. niger var. awamori genes involved in different secretory functions. This revealed both similarities and differences to corresponding studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae...|$|E
