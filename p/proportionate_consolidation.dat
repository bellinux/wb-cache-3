50|$|With {{effect from}} 1 January 2013 (2014 in the EU), the {{requirements}} of IAS 31 were replaced by IFRS 11. IFRS 11 makes two main changes to IAS 31. Firstly, it allows investors in joint arrangements that are structured through an entity to look through that entity in certain circumstances and treat the joint arrangement as if no entity exists. Secondly, it removes the option to apply <b>proportionate</b> <b>consolidation</b> for joint ventures.|$|E
40|$|In {{the frame}} of the {{positive}} accounting theory, the article investigates if strategic, debt contract and political cost determinants affect the managerial choice to account for interests in joint controlled entities. By means of an ante IFRS 11 analysis, we question if Italian venturers prefer the <b>proportionate</b> <b>consolidation</b> rather than the equity method with the aim to accomplish the information perspective. Results confirm that strategic and debt contract motivations drive the managerial choice of the <b>proportionate</b> <b>consolidation.</b> The study has implications for scholars, practitioners and regulators as we address the international academic and standard setting debate by providing results that do not support the IASB decision to remove the <b>proportionate</b> <b>consolidation...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} type of jointly controlled entity influences the management choice to report interests {{in this kind of}} joint venture using the equity method or <b>proportionate</b> <b>consolidation.</b> We address this gap in the accounting choice literature by exploiting the UK setting where, due to the transition to IFRS, firms had to change their reporting method for interests in jointly controlled entities from the gross equity method to a similar approach (equity method) or to <b>proportionate</b> <b>consolidation.</b> We support our analysis on the classification of jointly controlled entities proposed by Hennart (1988). We hypothesize that venturers are more likely to change their reporting method to <b>proportionate</b> <b>consolidation</b> when the majority of their jointly controlled entities are cases of Link instead of Scale cooperation. After controlling for several variables, our results are consistent with the predictions and thus suggest that {{the type of}} jointly controlled entity {{plays an important role in}} the management decision to report interests in jointly controlled entities using the equity method or <b>proportionate</b> <b>consolidation.</b> However, the results also provide empirical evidence supporting the importance of debt covenant costs and monitoring costs in the choice between alternative reporting methods. 1...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{which are the}} key determinants affecting the management choice to account for interests in joint controlled entities using the Equity method or the <b>Proportionate</b> <b>consolidation.</b> The main question is if managers {{are more likely to}} accomplish the informative perspective in choosing the accounting treatment. Assuming that the <b>Proportionate</b> <b>consolidation</b> provides more useful accounting information, using a multiple theoretical approach, we address this gap by exploiting the Italian setting. Strategic, contractual and informational determinants are considered as main determinants. First results confirm the prediction that some strategic and contractual motivations affect the accounting choice...|$|E
40|$|No {{theoretical}} and empirical consensus exists on the appropriate reporting method for interests in Jointly Controlled Entities (JCEs). Alternatives concern equity method and <b>proportionate</b> <b>consolidation.</b> In the frame of a multiple theoretical approach, this study examines whether, using alternatives, managers {{are more likely to}} accomplish the information perspective in accounting for JCEs when some determinants occur. We address this gap by exploiting, for the first time, the Italian setting. Results seem to confirm some predictions...|$|E
40|$|This Thesis is a {{research}} study concerned with the accounting issues of the consolidation of interests in Joint Controlled Entities (here after JCEs). The main purpose of the Thesis is to observe the accounting convergence for the consolidation of interests in JCEs using the Equity method or the <b>Proportionate</b> <b>consolidation</b> and to investigate {{the factors that influence}} managers' decision to reporting one of the two alternative methods. These goals are addressed through the implementation of different methodologies as well as of multiple theoretical frameworks...|$|E
40|$|Our paper {{intends to}} analyze the {{relation}} between the comparability of financial statements and the market reaction to the differing accounting choices for the consolidation of interests in joint controlled entities (JCEs). Assuming that differences between the <b>Proportionate</b> <b>consolidation</b> and the Equity method on the financial statement of the venturer mainly refer to the total assets, total liabilities, total revenues and total expenses, without changes in terms of equity and net income, we formulate some starting assumptions. Considering the previous literature and the assumptions above, the current study aims to contribute to the literature by exploring the following main research question: which is the market reaction on price/earnings deriving from the two different accounting treatments? To provide first results, we are going to measure accounting comparability through Herfindhal index related to the differing accounting choices for the consolidation of interests in joint controlled entities (JCEs), hence we conduct a descriptive analysis, whose aim is to describe the distribution of the 21 Italian groups, each years from 2004 to 2010 based on two parameters, Price/Earnings and method of consolidation for JCE’s, with the purpose to verify if the market is able to capture the above mentioned lack of comparability deriving from a multiple accounting option...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to observe the Accounting convergence in the reporting for interests in joint controlled entities (JCEs) using the Equity method or the <b>Proportionate</b> <b>consolidation</b> and to explore the determinants that could explain the application of each accounting option. Assuming that the Equity method improves some key performance indicators, firstly we measure the accounting convergence using the van der Tas H index. Secondly, we observe the distribution of both the accounting choices for JCEs and the P/E ratios – as a measure of the firm’s investors reputation – in order to capture if the market rewards firms using the Equity method. Finally, we conduct a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in order to capture the existence of latent variables able to explicate the different accounting choices. The data source is the Italian listed companies consolidated financial statements for the period 2006 - 2010 holding JCEs. First remarks show that there is a lack of convergence in the accounting for JCEs. Further, the market seems not to reward companies applying the Equity method. However, the PCA reveals the existence of latent variables that could explain the choice of the reporting method used by the firms of our sample...|$|E
40|$|In 1995, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) {{changed its}} Generally Accepted Accounting Principles on {{accounting}} for joint ventures from permitting {{a choice between}} the equity method (EM) and <b>proportionate</b> <b>consolidation</b> (PC) to requiring only PC. More recently, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has decided to issue a new standard that will eliminate choice between EM and PC and require only EM; but as of October 2010 a new standard was still to be issued. The past Canadian and proposed IASB changes are similar in that choice between the same two reporting methods is removed but differ in the required alternative, PC for Canada and EM for the IASB. In this paper we use a sample of Canadian companies over the period 1985 - 2003 to study financial reporting for joint ventures. To our knowledge, our Canadian sample {{is the only one}} reflecting a reduction of choice in financial reporting methods for joint ventures. Therefore, our results have particular relevance for evaluating the IASB's proposed change. Specifically, we investigate whether firms that use EM between 1985 and 1994 experience a decline in value relevance of key balance sheet amounts such as total assets and liabilities when forced to use PC from 1995 onwards. Since 1995 firms are also required to provide footnote disclosures on their share of joint venture assets and liabilities in addition to revenues, expenses and cash flows. Using these disclosures, we investigate whether disaggregate joint venture assets and liabilities are incrementally and overall value relevant. We find that firms that are forced to switch from EM to PC experience a decline in value relevance of reported assets and liabilities. The firms that use PC for the entire sample period experience no such decline. We also find that joint venture assets and liabilities are incrementally and overall value relevant when disclosures are mandatory from 1995 onwards. Our results show that the removal of choice of financial reporting method does have value-relevance implications, something that is of importance to users. We also find that the requirement of additional disclosure of joint venture assets and liabilities is value relevant, which may offset, to some extent, the costs of the reduction in choice. Our inferences may have implications for a number of jurisdictions across Europe and beyond that are affected by a similar reduction of accounting choice proposed by the IASB...|$|E
