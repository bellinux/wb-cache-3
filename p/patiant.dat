40|$|Abstract I chose as {{the theme}} of my thesis the {{effectiveness}} of physiotherapy following knee injuries. The aim of this work was determine whether appropriate and timely preventive treatment can prevent acute knee injuries in chronically unstable knee. Specifially, {{is it possible to}} avoid reinjuring or causing trauma to chronically unstable knee during physiotherapy. Research was conducted using a qualitative method and case reports on two women who had problems with chronic knee instability. The first patient received therapy from 15. 1. to 6. 4. 2009, while the second patient received therapy from 24. 1. to 14. 4. 2009. Thus both <b>patiant</b> received approximately 3 mont of physiotherapy. In the course of rehabilitation, treatment focused on sensory motor stimulation therapy. This therapy took place at two different physiotherapy clinics, where I had the most effective monitoring instruments. Both <b>patiant</b> with chronic knee instability were of simile age and the therapy was conducted during approximately the same time period. The first patient, whose sports activities typically involve home exercise and training, is rapidly recovering from both her subjective and objekctive symptoms. Further gradual improvement in her condition can be reasonably assumed. For the second patient, the pain fluctuates depending upon the sport load placed upon the knee. The goal there was to eliminate the phenomenon of qgiving way". From an objective point of view, this problem was fully resolved. In connection with these findings the patints were properly advised of therapy, shown how they can continue the therapy by themselves in their homes, encouraged to regularly return to the clinic for follow- up exams, and advised to purchase qunstable boards" for their homes...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012. Patients with {{disorders}} such as Essential Tremors and Parkinson's Disease often {{lose their}} ability to write with a pen or pencil. This raises inconveniences in everyday living. A pen has been designed that enables many of these patients to sign their name, write etc. that works solely by mechanical principals, inertia of a spring suspended pen holder inside an outer case which resists movement when used by the patient holding the outer case. The pen can be carried in a large pocket, backpack, or briefcase. Prototypes of the pen have been made from easily available parts, such as PVC pipe, Al tubing, rubber bands, and lead fishing weights. Mass spring equations are presented to help model the optimum weight and rubber band tensions. This thesis builds on research by Dr. Kumagai of California State University Sacramento, a professor and graduate students Kosuke Naritomi, and Tyrone Tracy. They have designed and made a working model of the essential tremor pen and the model discussed here is an improvement in some aspects. The prototypes show {{that it is possible}} to design a pen that reduces the effect of tremors, using the proposed design, if the inertia in the pen body is optimised for the particular <b>patiant,</b> at least when the persons tremor is mild.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONIsolated {{superior}} mesentericveinous thrmbophlebitis is a rarely recognised condition {{associated with}} a high morbidity. It usually develops secondary to infection in the drainage area of the portal venous system, like appendix. PRESENTATION OF CASEWe report a case of neglected perforated acute appendicitis complicated by superior mesenteric venous pyelephlebitis <b>patiant</b> represented with a vague pain to right of umlicus, which is atypical this why cat scan was done and showed obstructed superiormesentric vein, portal vein was free with acute appendicitis. Appendicectomy and treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, anticoagulation, and platelets led to a full recovery. Follow-up imaging after one month revealed complete canalization of superior mesentric vein. DISCUSSIONAbdominal pain if atypical like our case report need imaging diagnosis. Modern diagnostic imaging techniques help the early diagnosis of acute phase pylephlebitis. CT can detect primary source of infection, extent of pylephlebitis, CT scan is the most reliable initially. Ultrasound scan with color flow Doppler is also a sensitive test for confirming partial patency of the portal vein and portal vein thrombosis accidentally discovered complete obliteration of superior mesenteric vein with thrombosis which remained not propagated by serial Doppler ultrasound of liver. Appropriate treatment should be initiated as soon as possible. To avoid extension to portal vein. The principal treatment for pylephlebitis is to remove the source of infection as appendicectomy. Anticoagulants must be used. Regarding the treatment of portal thrombosis, post operative use of heparin has been advocated.

40|$|Background and Objective: The {{receipt of}} {{appropriate}} and safe {{health care is}} of the basic rights of <b>patiants</b> and its provision is the main task {{of the health care}} delivery system. The role of error reporting in the reduction of future occurrence of that error is undeniable. Therefore, the removal of barriers to error reporting has particular importance. The present study aimed to investigate the association between patient safety climate and barriers to reporting of nursing error in Social Security Hospitals in Kerman province, Iran. Materials and Method: This was a cross-sectional, descriptive-correlative study. The study population consisted of all nurses of Social Security Hospitals in Kerman in 2014. Sampling was performed using the census method (n = 233). The Patient Safety Climate Questionnaire and Barriers to Nursing Error Reporting Questionnaire were used after obtaining satisfactory reliability and validity. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 16 and frequency distribution tables and central indices. To achieve goals, the parametric test of t-test, one way ANOVA, and Pearson correlation coefficient were used. Results: The mean and standard deviations of the safety climate score (66 ± 10) and the barriers to nursing error reporting score (69 ± 13) were obtained: both were at a medium level. A significant inverse relationship was observed between patient safety climate and barriers to error reporting (P < 0. 020) (r = - 0. 15). Conclusion: Based on the results, the error reporting barriers and safety climate scores were at an average level. Given the inverse relationship between safety climate and barriers to reporting error, it can be concluded that the most important step toward removing barriers is creating an atmosphere in which each of the nursing staff voluntarily reports her/his error and its causes to other members of the treatment team...|$|R

Purpose: This study was done to estimate the causes of hyphaema among Sudanese patients, to evaluate its magnitude and the associated intraocular injuries in KETH. Method: A descriptive study was done in KETH for six months time, from August 2001 to January 2002. 100 eyes of 100 patients were studied. Testing was done by ophthalmic examination and other investigations such as eye ultrasonography and X- rays. Results:The maximum affected age varied between 10 – 19 years. Males were more affected than females. Trauma was found to be the major cause of hyphaema accounting for 86 %. Percentage of open globe injuries was 27. 9 % and of closed globe injures 72. 1 %. Complications recorded were corneal blood staining (2 %),rebleeding(4 %) and elevated IOP(> 35 mmHg) in 11 %. Corneal perforation associated with hyphaema due to trauma was found in 21 eyes out of 100 eyes, iris prolapse in 11 eyes, dislocated lens in one eye and ruptured lens in 2 eyes. 8 Vitreous haemorrhage was found in 15 eyes with hyphaema and RD in 10 eyes. The percentage of blindness in <b>patiants</b> presented to KETH with hyphaema and associated injuries in this six months period was 33 % Conclusions: It is proved that trauma is the major cause of hyphaema and most of injuries were closed globe injuries,while surgically induced- and spontaneous hyphaemas represent the second and third causes respectively. The children and young adults were the most affected group in this study.

HC 1) with titrated dose from 75 mg to 225 mg for 6 weeks. Plasma level? of nitroxazepine (Sintamil (R)) and its metabolites desmethyl (D), N-oxide (N-O) and carboxylic acid (c) were estimated. Anti-depressant efficacy was judged by reduction in Hamilton Rating Depression Scale (HDRS) scores, and tolerability was monitored by reports of unwanted effects. The overall reduction in HDRS score was about 50 % by 6 weeks. The plasma levels of nitroxazepin (ng/ral) showed a rise from a mean (fSEM) level. 47. 0 4 - 7. 3 on day 1 (dose 75 mg) to 129. 84 - 24. 6 on day 7 (dose 150 mg) (p< 0. 01) and remained steady till day 21. There were large interindividual variations. The metabolites followed a similar pattern. The HDRS score showed a steady reduction between day 14 and 42 when the levels of nitroxizepine and des-methyl metabolites were maintained between 176. 5 ng/ml to 251 ng/ml. In recent years, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of tricyclic antidepressant (TGAs) has been recommended for several therapeutic situations (Preston et al., 1988; De-Oliveira et a)., 1989). Besides the use of TDM in monitoring compliance and avoiding toxicity in high risk groups c. g. elderly, cardiac illness, ii has also been recommended to maximise clinic. il response (Preston et al., 1988; De-Oliveira et a!., 1989).

40|$|In the {{comprehensive}} management of epilepsy, both preventive pharmacological treatment {{and awareness of}} possible seizure precipitating factors are important. The true cause of seizure generation is often hard to disentangle, as triggers often are obscure and occur in concert. This dissertation examines possible seizure precipitants in patients admitted to Department of Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology, St Olav's Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, July 2006 -February 2010, soon after a seizure. The results from the study are presented in three papers. In paper I, preictal caffeine intake was compared to consumption in a seizure free period as animal models and case reports have suggested caffeine to contribute to seizure development. Dietary caffeine intake 24 h prior to the seizure was not different compared to habitual intake or compared to intake in a seizure free period. Therefore, caffeine {{does not seem to}} be a common seizure precipitant in a clinical setting, and patients should be accordingly advised. Non-adherence persists as a major obstacle to optimal epilepsy treatment, but its magnitude has been difficult to determine. In paper II, patients with epilepsy acutely admitted for seizures were included, and concentration/dose ratios of AEDs at admission were compared with the <b>patiant's</b> own steady-state, drug-fasting control values. Non-adherence was seen in 39 %, and was more common in younger patients. Many patients seem to be unaware of missed drug intake. AED serum concentrations should be part of the emergency care. Efforts to improve treatment adherence is an important part of comprehensive epilepsy management. Sleep-time in the 24 h prior to the seizure was assessed in paper III, and was found to be lower when compared to follow-up. Anxiety and depression did not correlate with differences in sleep time, but the interaction between alcohol and sleep was high. However, sleep loss stood out as an independent trigger. This study demonstrates that epileptic seizures usually seem to be precipitated by a combination of clinical factors...|$|R

All patients were treated with bilateral mandibular distraction: two cases with an external multivector distraction device, six cases with an internal non-resorbable device and two cases with an internal resorbable device. In one case, the patient with Goldenhar's Syndrome, the procedure was repeated. Results The resolution of symptoms was obtained in all patients, and, when present, tracheotomy was removed without complications. Of the two patients with pre-existing tracheotomies, in the younger patient (5 months old) the tracheotomy was removed 7 days postoperatively. In the Goldenhar's syndrome case (2 years old) a Montgomery device was necessary for 6 months due to the presence of tracheotomy-inducted tracheomalacia. Patients were discharged when the endpoint was obtained: symptoms and signs of airway obstruction were resolved, PAS and maxillomandibular relationship improved, and tracheotomy, when present, removed. During the follow-up, no injury to the inferior alveolar nerve was noted and scarring was significant in only the two cases treated with external devices. Conclusion Mandibular Distraction Osteogenesis is a good solution in solving respiratory distress when other procedures are failed in paediatric patients with severe micrognatia. </p...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies were}} {{performed}} on a total of 198 patients with cancer of the urinary bladder, consisting of 163 males and 35 females, treated at the Department of Urology of Kyoto University Hospital {{during the period from}} April 1962 to June 1966 (Table 5). Diagnosis on these cases was made {{based on the results of}} cystoscopic and histological findings as primary cancer of the bladder. Controls, to be done similar epidemiological studies, were selected from patients visited at out-patient clinic who were adjusted for age and resident distributions to the cancer patients, numbered 163 males and 59 females. On the other hand, observations were made on yearly change of death rate of cancer of the urinary bladder in Japan based on the vital statistics, to study the sex and age adjusted incidence. Literatures were reviewed to discuss comparative findings on cancer of the bladder in domestic and foreign countries on pathogeographic point of view. Results are summraized as follows. 1) Yearly distribution of number of death due to cancer of the bladder showed a trend of marked increase in Japan. During the period of 16 years from 1947 to 1962, number of death increased almost every year. Comparing in 1962 to in 1947, the increases were 3. 5 times in males and 2. 9 times in females for number of death, 2. 8 times in males and 2. 4 times in females for crude death rate and 2. 3 times in males and 1. 8 times in females for age-adjusted death rate. The age-adjusted death rate of all malignant neoplasm during the same period showed slow increase, namely from 100. 2 in 1947 to 135. 4 in 1962 in males and 82. 8 in 1947 to 95. 2 in 1962 in females (Table 1, Fig. 1, 2). It was considered that the cause of increase in incidence of cancer of the bladder must be clarified as an urgent problem. 2) A s sex prevalence, the male to female ratio among a total of 259 <b>patiants</b> with cancer of the bladder entered in the Department of Urology of Kyoto University Hospital during the period from 1954 to 1966 was found to be 4. 6 with marked male predominance. However, a total of 304 cases of autopsied cancer of the bladder collected from the Annual of the Pathological Autopsy Case of Japan from 1959 to 1962 showed the ratio being 2. 5 with male predominance. In addition, the ratio among 12, 926 cases of death due to cancer of the bladder collected from Japanese Vital Statistics from 1947 to 1962 was counted as 1. 6 which was less male predominance. These figures indicated that sex prevalence of this disease vary by the materials collected (Table 2, 3). 3) As age distribution of this disease, a nalysis of 259 clinical cases seen in the Department of Urology of Kyoto University Hospital showed most frequent occurrence in the 7 th decade, being 40. 4 %, followed by in the 6 th decade 28. 2 % and 8 th decade 16. 0 %, with the total of over 50 years of age groups being 86. 3 % in males. However in females, although the total of over 50 years of age group occupies 82. 5 %, the percentages of 6 th, 7 th decades and 8 th decades were 30. 4 %, 28. 2 % and 19. 6 % respectively, which showed less sex differences than males (Table 2). The crude death rate of cancer of the bladder by age-group in Japan in 1962 showed higher rates in male than female in every age group and sudden increases in both sexes over 45 years of age with further rise in accompamied with advancing of age (Fig. 3). The yearly change of age specific death rate of cancer of the bladder during the period from 1947 to 1962 demonstrated increasing trends in over 50 years of age groups in males and in over 60 years of age groups in females (Fig. 4). These figures dislosed that recent increase in death rate due to cancer of the bladder is attributed to the increases of the disease in over 50 years of age groups in male and in over 60 years of age groups in females. 4) Comparing the age-adjust e d death rates of cancer of the bladder in Japan to in foreign countries (20 countries) in 1958 and 1959, higher rates were seen in South Africa, England and Wales, Scotland, Denmark, New Zealand and United States (white) with the lowest country being in Japan in males. In females, the rate was high in United States (nonwhite), Denmark, Scotland, England and Wales, Canada and United States (white) with the lowest country being also in Japan (Fig. 5). Comparison of age standardized death rates in Japan and in foreign countries from 1952 to 1956 showed similar tendencies. The foreign countries having low rate as in Japan were Chile for male and Venezuela for female (Table 4). There was a tendency that low rates of cancer of the lung and high rates of cancer of the stomack were seen in the countries having low rates of cancer of the bladder (Fig. 8). The death rate of cancer of the bladder showed marked increasing trend in both sexes in England and Denmark, and increasing trend in male in the United States (Fig. 6). 5) The total of 198 cases of this series was devided into 3 grops accord i ng to residence, large city (over 1 million), city and rural districts, and compared to control groups which were selected from patients entered in the Department during same period and matched by sex and age distributions. No statistically significant difference was observed on the residential distribution between the cancer patients and the controls (x 2 = 2. 460, 0 = 2, 0. 25 p> 0. 05 which was not significantly different. However based on the results obtained from the history survey of venerial diseases, significance might be appeared if calculation is made on larger sample. (Table 10) 10) Smoking habit was compared between the series of patients with cancer o f the bladder and control. Smoking habit in 163 male patients with cancer of the bladder and 163 male controls were found in 92. 0 % and 77. 3 % respectively. X 2 -test showed significant difference between these two groups at risk of below 0. 5 % (x 2 = 13. 607, p< 0. 005). In females, smoking habit was seen in 37. 9 % of 29 patients with cancer of the bladder and in 13. 0 % of 59 controls. This figures also gave significant difference at risk of below 1 % (x 2 = 6. 823, 0. 005 <p< 0. 10). Relative risks (ratio of smokers to non-smkers) for male and female patients were 3. 35 and 3. 8 respectively (Table 11). Furthermore, duration of the habit and amount of smoking was compared between the patients and controls. Cut and pipe tobacoo was calculated as its 1 gram is equivalent to 1 cigarett. Then calculation was made on cigarettes -a day- years, from which smoking habit was designated as the following manner. heavy smoker : over 600 cigarettes-a day-years medium smoker : between 600 and 300 cigarettes-a day-years light smoker : less than 300 cigarettes-a day-years. The results obtained from 150 male patients with cancer of the bladder demonstrated that heavy, medium and light smokers were 43. 4 %, 41. 3 % and 15. 3 %, respectively, which showed statistically significant difference, at risk of below 0. 5 %, in comparison with 126 patients of controls having heavy, medium and light smoking habits in 33. 3 %, 31. 8 % and 34. 9 %, respectively (x'= 14. 266, c 6 = 2, p< 0. 005). This means that male patients with cancer of the bladder consisted of more frequent mumber of heavy and medium smokers (Table 12). However, comparing results of studies in foreign countries, relative risk of heavy smoker is remarkably low in the male patients (Table 15). In Japan,virtually all kinds of tabacoo are provided as cigarett. Thus only 3 patients in our series used to smoke only cut tabacoo. In all Japan, the yearly amount of consumpticn of cigarett in 1963 increased about twice as much as that in 1945 (Fig. 10). These facts might concern to one of the cause of increase in prevalence of cancer of the bladder observed in Japanese population. In addition, another specificity was demonstrated on the histological pattern of the primary lesion in heavy smokers. In 42 patints who were histologically examined among 65 heavy smoking patients with cancer of the bladder, transitional cell cancer was found in 41 cases and squamous cell cancer was seen in only one case (Table 13). These data on relationship between smoking habit and cancer of the bladder have never been reported in Japan, but the problem is very important and must be studied further as seriously as the relationship between smoking and cancer of its lung...|$|R
