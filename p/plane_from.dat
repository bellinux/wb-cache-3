5|$|This was {{a result}} of the attacks from Midway, {{as well as of the}} morning flight leader's {{recommendation}} of a second strike. Re-arming had been under way for about 30 minutes when, at 07:40, the delayed scout <b>plane</b> <b>from</b> Tone signaled that it had sighted a sizable American naval force to the east, but neglected to describe its composition. Later evidence suggests Nagumo did not receive the sighting report until 08:00.|$|E

5|$|After finding Sharon's trashed hotel room, Mulder {{meets with}} Millar, who {{tells him that}} the door was pulled off the <b>plane</b> <b>from</b> the outside while it was in flight. Later, Frish finds his {{colleague}} dead from a faked suicide. A group of commandos arrive to capture Frish, but he escapes. Frish goes to see Mulder and Scully, telling them that he lied before and that his commanding officer had ordered him to track the plane's coordinates as it was being intercepted by a second aircraft. Seconds later, {{there was an explosion}} and the plane disappeared from his radar. Mulder believes that a third aircraft, a UFO, approached the plane and was destroyed by the second aircraft, also causing the Flight 549 crash. The agents leave with Frish and are soon chased by the commandos. Meanwhile, Millar returns to the crash site and encounters a UFO. He finds Sharon nearby, having just been returned by her abductors.|$|E
5|$|Battle for Zendikar was {{a return}} to the plane of Zendikar, which had been ravaged by the Eldrazi horrors. This marks a change in Magics storytelling, where each block's story is shown from the {{perspective}} of a group of planeswalkers called the Gatewatch. Shadows Over Innistrad is {{a return to}} Innistrad, where Avacyn has been corrupted. The next set, Eldritch Moon, focuses on the fact that Emrakul, the most powerful Eldrazi titan who had been missing from the Battle for Zendikar storyline, is now on Innistrad. Together, the Gatewatch must find a way to save the <b>plane</b> <b>from</b> Emrakul's influence. This story also focuses on cosmic horror instead of the traditional gothic horror of old Innistrad.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{tensions}} of the Cold War, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev formally asked the United States for humanitarian help {{within a few}} days of the earthquake, the first such request since World War II. One hundred and thirteen countries sent substantial amounts of humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union in the form of rescue equipment, search teams and medical supplies, but private donations and assistance from non-governmental organizations also had {{a large part of the}} international effort. While transporting some of these supplies to the region, a Soviet aircraft carrying 9 crew members and 69 military personnel and a transport <b>plane</b> <b>from</b> Yugoslavia were both destroyed in separate incidents. In support of the relief effort, recording artists united to produce several music-related contributions for the victims of the quake. A song was produced by a duo of French composers (including Charles Aznavour) and a studio album that featured songs donated by mainstream rock bands was released from the Rock Aid Armenia effort by the British music industry.|$|E

5|$|Kalep took up {{flying in}} the late 1920s, when she met Dutch aviator Anthony Fokker while holidaying in St. Moritz {{and asked him to}} teach her to fly a plane. She {{completed}} five hours of flying with Fokker and, after breaking her arm during a sledding accident in the winter of 1931, took her pilot's test in Germany on 1 August 1931. She passed, becoming the first qualified female pilot from Estonia, and the seventh woman to pass the exam in Germany. Soon after receiving her license, Kalep and Valter Mayer, a German mechanic, co-piloted a small Klemm <b>plane</b> <b>from</b> Berlin through Eastern Europe, stopping in Szczecin, Gdańsk, Kaunas, Jelgava and Riga, finally landing in Tallinn on 18 August. Upon her arrival in Tallinn, Kalep was greeted by a crowd of journalists and officers of the Estonian Air Force; she briefly visited relatives in Nõmme before beginning her return journey to Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|Steve becomes {{paranoid}} that Charlie will {{steal the}} gold, {{and starts to}} launder it faster, but he is forced to kill Yevhen when he reveals {{his knowledge of the}} Venice heist. Yevhen's death infuriates Mashkov, his cousin and a leading member of an Ukrainian crime family. Mashkov connects the murder to Charlie through Skinny Pete. Further uneased, Steve makes plans to transport the gold to Mexico City by a private <b>plane</b> <b>from</b> Los Angeles International Airport after transporting it there in an armored car. Napster overhears of this, and Charlie and his gang make a new plan to steal the gold en route to the airport by hijacking the city's traffic control system to force the armored car to a planned spot where they will execute the heist.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} requested for the United States to send {{vessels to}} assist those {{affected by the}} storm. A number of residents of Belize City were left without food and water supplies. The USS Swan (AM-34), stationed at nearby Trujillo, Honduras, was dispatched to send aid to British Honduras. United States President Herbert Hoover ordered the United States Navy and American Red Cross to cooperate in relief efforts. Both agencies and organizations ordered a United States Marine Corps <b>plane</b> <b>from</b> Managua, Nicaragua, to send $2,500worth of medical supplies to affected areas of British Honduras. Throughout the city, relief kitchens were set up. The Government of British Honduras eventually began burning areas with debris and bodies, to prevent spread of disease. Monrad Metzgen, a lieutenant of the British Honduras Defense Force, became responsible for the rescue of persons trapped, feeding those without shelter, and the burial of the deceased. For his efforts, Metzgen received an Order of the British Empire award from King George V of the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The Browns {{advanced}} to the AAFC championship in 1946, but {{a week before the}} game, Rymkus and teammates Jim Daniell and Mac Speedie were arrested and held for several hours after a confrontation with Cleveland police. The men were drinking as they waited to pick up Speedie's wife, who was coming on a <b>plane</b> <b>from</b> Utah. Daniell, who was driving the car the three men were in, honked at a police car that was blocking him, leading to an argument and the arrests. Rymkus and Speedie were charged with creating a disturbance and Daniell was charged with public intoxication. Daniell, the Browns' captain, was kicked off the team after the incident, but Rymkus and Speedie remained. The Browns {{went on to win the}} championship the following week, and Rymkus was named to a combined all-AAFC and NFL team.|$|E

5|$|Howell and Fraser {{took off}} in their Martinsyde from Hounslow Heath Aerodrome on 4 December 1919. However, the pair soon ran into poor weather, and were forced to land the {{aircraft}} in Dijon, France later that day.

On 10 December, Howell and Fraser {{took off in}} their fully fuelled <b>plane</b> <b>from</b> Taranto in the afternoon. They intended to reach Africa next, but poor weather conditions forced them to alter their plan and they instead headed for Crete. Their Martinsyde was reported flying over St George's Bay, Corfu at 20:00 that evening. For unknown reasons, Howell and Fraser attempted to execute an emergency landing at Corfu. They were, however, unable {{to make it to}} the coast and were forced to crash into the sea. Citizens in the area later reported that they heard cries for help coming from the sea that night, but that a rescue was not possible in the rough conditions. Both Howell and Fraser were drowned.|$|E
50|$|North America's {{situation}} in the game {{is identical to the}} situation found by Western European countries. The only difference is that <b>planes</b> <b>from</b> American companies are cheaper than <b>planes</b> <b>from</b> Western European countries.
