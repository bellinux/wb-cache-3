5|$|Zygoballus sexpunctatus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to Zygoballus rufipes, with whom its range overlaps. The male can be distinguished from Z.rufipes by the large spot of white scales {{at the beginning of}} the thoracic slope (which is lacking in Z. rufipes), and by the longitudinal division present on the bulb of the <b>pedipalp</b> (Z. rufipes has a transverse division). The female can best be distinguished by the form of the epigyne (the external genital structure).|$|E
5|$|Spiders a {{class of}} arachnids have four pairs of legs; a body of two segments—a {{cephalothorax}} and an abdomen. Spiders have no wings and no antennae. They have mouthparts called chelicerae which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous. They have a second pair of appendages called pedipalps attached to the cephalothorax. These have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs. At {{the end of each}} male <b>pedipalp</b> is a spoon-shaped cymbium that acts to support the copulatory organ.|$|E
5|$|The {{legs are}} reddish brown, or {{sometimes}} yellowish, with the femora of the anterior (first) pair being darker and enlarged, {{especially in the}} male. The anterior legs have three pairs of long spines on the ventral surface of the tibia and two pairs of spines on the metatarsus. The Peckhams give the following measurements for the lengths of the legs of a male specimen, starting with the anterior pair: 3.7mm, 2.2mm, 2mm, 3mm. In females, the fourth pair of legs are the longest. The <b>pedipalp</b> in the male has a single tibial apophysis which tapers gradually.|$|E
50|$|In spiders the intromittent {{organs are}} the male <b>pedipalps,</b> {{even though these}} are not {{primarily}} sexual organs, but serve as indirect mating organs; in the male the <b>pedipalps</b> have hollow, clubbed tips, often of complex internal anatomy. The sexually mature male typically deposits his semen onto a specially woven silken mat, then sucks the emission into his <b>pedipalps.</b> In mating, he inserts the openings of the <b>pedipalps</b> in turn into the epigyne, the female external genital structure.|$|R
50|$|Ricinuleid <b>pedipalps</b> {{are complex}} appendages. They are {{typically}} used to manipulate food items, but also bear many sensory structures {{and are used}} as 'short range' sensory organs. The <b>pedipalps</b> end in pincers that are small relative to their bodies, when compared {{to those of the}} related orders of scorpions and pseudoscorpions. Similar pincers on the <b>pedipalps</b> have now been found in the extinct order Trigonotarbida (see Relationships).|$|R
50|$|<b>Pedipalps</b> (commonly {{shortened}} to palps or palpi) are {{the second}} pair of appendages of chelicerates - {{a group of}} arthropods including spiders, scorpions, horseshoe crabs, and sea spiders. The <b>pedipalps</b> are lateral to the chelicerae ("jaws") and anterior to the first pair of walking legs.|$|R
25|$|The pedipalps {{have the}} typical {{arachnid}} structure with a coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia and tarsus. They are pediform, i.e. {{they look like}} small legs and were not modified into pincers. There is no evidence for a special sperm transfer device as in the modified palpal organ of male spiders. Interestingly, in at least the palaeocharinids and anthracomartids {{the tip of the}} <b>pedipalp</b> is modified into a small claw formed from the tarsal claw (or apotele) and a projection from the tarsus. As mentioned above, a very similar arrangement is seen {{at the end of the}} <b>pedipalp</b> in Ricinulei.|$|E
25|$|Members of Mesothelae have {{paraxial}} chelicerae, {{two pairs}} of coxal glands on the legs, eight eyes grouped on a nodule, {{two pairs of}} book lungs, and no endites {{on the base of}} the <b>pedipalp.</b> Most have at least seven or eight spinnerets near the middle of the abdomen. Lateral spinnerets are multi-segmented.|$|E
25|$|The genus Brachypelmides, erected by Schmidt and Krause in 1994, is {{considered}} a synonym of Brachypelma by some sources, including the World Spider Catalog, although this has been rejected by Schmidt. When broadly defined, Brachypelma is distinguished from related genera by the plumose setae (hairs) on the prolateral (forward-facing) side of the trochanter and femur of the first leg and on the retrolateral (outward-facing) side of the <b>pedipalp.</b>|$|E

25|$|Male {{courtship}} {{display is}} similar to that of P. apacheanus, P. clarus, or P. octopunctatus. The male begins his display by holding the carapace very high, shifting the abdomen to one side, and raising the first pair of legs. In this position, he moves before the female, stopping after each few steps. The male advances in a zig-zag pathway, shifting his abdomen to the other side at the end of each oblique approach. Throughout, the dancing male flicks his forelegs up and down, holding them wide apart at first and bringing them closer and closer together as he nears the female. Then, with forelegs held almost parallel before him, he touches the female cautiously once or twice. If the female remains still at this stage, the male climbs over her, and uses the forelegs to help turn her abdomen to the side. When the genital pore, which lies on the ventral abdomen, is thus exposed, the male inserts his palpus. After 2-3 min., the male withdraws this <b>pedipalp,</b> turns the female's abdomen in the other direction, and inserts the other <b>pedipalp.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of {{hairs on the}} legs and palp and {{the shape of the}} male and female genitalia are the diagnostic features of the broadly defined genus. The prolateral (forward facing) surface of the trochanter and femur of the first leg and the retrolateral surface of the <b>pedipalp</b> have plumose hairs, and there is no pad of plumose hairs on the femur of the fourth leg. The male palpal bulb has a flattened, spoon-shaped embolus; females have fused spermathecae, with a flat cross-section.|$|E
25|$|In 1892, Ferdinand Karsch {{suggested}} that the rare and rather bizarre looking ricinuleids (Ricinulei) were the last living descendants of the trigonotarbids. A similar hypothesis was reintroduced by Dunlop, who pointed out distinct similarities between these arachnid groups. Both have opisthosomal tergites divided into median and lateral plates and both have a complicated coupling mechanism between the prosoma and the opisthosoma which 'locks' {{the two halves of}} the body together. Although cladistic analysis has tended to recover ricinuleids in their traditional position closely related to mites and ticks, further discoveries have revealed that the tip of the <b>pedipalp</b> ends in a small claw in both trigonotarbids and ricinuleids.|$|E

50|$|Chelate or sub-chelate (pincer-like) <b>pedipalps</b> {{are found}} in several {{arachnid}} groups, i.e. Ricinulei, Thelyphonida, scorpions and pseudoscorpions; but the chelae {{in most of these}} groups may not be homologous with those found in Xiphosura. The <b>pedipalps</b> are distinctly raptorial (modified for seizing prey) in the Amblypygi, Thelyphonida, Schizomida and some Opiliones belonging to the laniatorid group.|$|R
25|$|Almost all spiders {{reproduce}} sexually. They are {{unusual in}} {{that they do not}} transfer sperm directly, for example via a penis. Instead the males transfer it to specialized structures (palpal bulbs) on the pedipalps and then meander about to search for a mate. These palps are then introduced into the female's epigyne. This was first described in 1678 by Martin Lister. In 1843 it was revealed that males build a nuptial web into which they deposit a drop of semen, which is then taken up by the copulatory apparatus (the palpal bulb) in the <b>pedipalp.</b> The structure of the copulatory apparatus varies significantly between males of different species. While the widened palpal tarsus of the southern house spider, Kukulcania hibernalis (Filistatidae), only forms a simple bulb containing the coiled blind duct, members of the genus Argiope have a highly complex structure.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} {{view was}} that the chelicerae were homologous to the second antennae of crustaceans (i.e., they are innervated from the tritocerebrum), a view based partly {{on the fact that}} the chelicerae were innervated from the same ganglion that innervates the labrum, which is the tritocerebrum in crustaceans and insects. Given that there are apparently no appendages in front of the chelicerae, the implication was that the deuterocerebrum had been lost in chelicerates (the protocerebrum innervates the eyes in both groups in this view). While this view still has its defenders (notably Colette and Jacques Bitsch), the alternative view that the chelicerae are innervated from the deuterocerebrum has gained ground, based on molecular development in mites and spiders, and neuroanatomy in Limulus. If this is the case, then chelicerates simply have no tritocerebrum, i.e. there is no third supraoesophageal ganglion of the brain; the segment corresponding to it would be the suboesophageal <b>pedipalp</b> one. Such a theory does not, however, immediately account for the same ganglionic innervation of the chelicerae and labrum, although one solution is simply to claim that the labrum itself is not homologous between mandibulates and chelicerates (the view, for example, of Dieter Waloszek and colleagues).|$|E
2500|$|In {{other species}} males voluntarily self-amputate a <b>pedipalp</b> prior to mating {{and thus the}} {{mutilation}} is not driven by sexual cannibalism. This has been hypothesized {{to be due to}} an increased fitness advantage of half or full eunuchs. Upon losing a <b>pedipalp</b> males experience a significant decrease in body weight that provides them with enhanced locomotor abilities and endurance, enabling them to better search for a mate and mate-guard after mating. This {{is referred to as the}} [...] "gloves-off" [...] theory.|$|E

2500|$|The first, or anterior, of {{the five}} pairs of leg-like {{appendages}} are not [...] "actual" [...] legs, but <b>pedipalps</b> and they have only five segments each. The <b>pedipalps</b> of Solifugae function partly as sense organs similar to insects' antennae, and partly in locomotion, feeding and fighting. In normal locomotion, they do not quite touch the ground, but are held out to detect obstacles and prey; in that attitude, they look particularly like an extra pair of legs or perhaps arms. Reflecting the great dependence of Solifugae on their tactile senses, their anterior true legs commonly are smaller and thinner than the posterior three pairs. That smaller anterior pair acts largely in a sensory role {{as a supplement to}} the <b>pedipalps,</b> and in many species they accordingly lack tarsi. At the tips of their <b>pedipalps,</b> Solifugae bear [...] adhesive organs, which they may use to capture flying prey, and which at least some species certainly use for climbing smooth surfaces.|$|R
50|$|The pedipalpi are two six-segment {{appendages}} {{connected to}} the thorax near the mouth and protruding {{on either side of}} both chelicerae. In most species of tarantula, the pedipalpi contain sharp jagged plates used to cut and crush food often called the coxae or maxillae. As with other spiders, the terminal portion of the pedipalpi of males function as part of its reproductive system. Male spiders spin a silken platform (sperm web) on the ground onto which they release semen from glands in their opistoma. Then they insert their <b>pedipalps</b> into the semen, absorb the semen into the <b>pedipalps,</b> and later insert the <b>pedipalps</b> (one at a time) into the reproductive organ of the female, which is located in her abdomen. The terminal segments of the <b>pedipalps</b> of male tarantulas are moderately larger in circumference than those of a female tarantula. Male tarantulas have special spinnerets surrounding the genital opening. Silk for the sperm web of the tarantula is exuded from these special spinnerets.|$|R
2500|$|When P. clarus males find females, the [...] males {{court by}} waving their legs and making their abdomens vibrate against the {{substrate}} (leaves, the ground, etc.). Males will court immature and adult virgin females, and also previously mated females. As the male dances, {{he approaches the}} female and touches the female cautiously once or twice. The female rejects the male by extending her first pair of legs whenever he approaches too closely, or shows acceptance by not blocking his advance. If accepted, the male climbs over her and uses his forelegs to turn her abdomen to the side. The turn exposes her genital pore, which lies {{on the underside of}} the abdomen, and the male inserts one semen-laden <b>pedipalp.</b> After two or three minutes the male withdraws this <b>pedipalp,</b> turns the female's abdomen the other way and inserts the other <b>pedipalp.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Before {{or after}} copulating with females, certain males of spider {{species in the}} {{superfamily}} Araneoidea become half or full eunuchs with {{one or both of}} their pedipalps (male genitals) severed. [...] This behavior is often seen in sexually cannibalistic spiders, causing them to exhibit the [...] "eunuch phenomenon". [...] Due to the chance that they may be eaten during or after copulation, male spiders use genital mutilation to increase their chances of successful mating. The male can increase his chances of paternity if the female's copulatory organs are blocked, which decreases sperm competition and her chances of mating with other males. In one study, females with mating plugs had a 75% less chance of re-mating. [...] Additionally, if a male successfully severs his <b>pedipalp</b> within the female copulatory duct the <b>pedipalp</b> can not only serve as a plug but can continue to release sperm to the female spermathacae, again increasing the male's chances of paternity. This is referred to as [...] "remote copulation". Occasionally (in 12% of cases in a 2012 study on Nephilidae spiders) palp severance is only partial due to copulation interruption by sexual cannibalism. Partial palp severance can result in a successful mating plug but not to the extent of full palp severance.|$|E
2500|$|The {{courtship}} {{starts with}} the male grasping the female's pedipalps with his own; the pair then perform a [...] "dance" [...] called the [...] "promenade à deux". In this [...] "dance", the male leads the female around searching for a suitable place to deposit his spermatophore. The courtship ritual can involve several other behaviours, such as juddering and a cheliceral kiss, in which the male's chelicerae – pincers – grasp the female's in a smaller more intimate version of the male's grasping the female's pedipalps {{and in some cases}} injecting a small amount of his venom into her <b>pedipalp</b> or {{on the edge of her}} cephalothorax, probably as a means of pacifying the female.|$|E
