5000|$|Since the {{mushrooms}} hold {{a lot of}} water, they are often prepared using a [...] "dry sauté" [...] method: after cleaning, {{the mushrooms}} are sliced {{and put in a}} covered <b>pan</b> <b>over</b> <b>high</b> heat with no oil or butter. The mushrooms then release much of their water, which can be allowed to boil off or be poured off and used as a stock. Many people often cook the mushrooms with butter because it [...] "sweetens" [...] them.|$|E
5000|$|Sautéing ( [...] or , {{from the}} French sauté , lit. [...] "jumped, bounced" [...] in {{reference}} to tossing while cooking) is a method of cooking food that uses {{a small amount of}} oil or fat in a shallow <b>pan</b> <b>over</b> relatively <b>high</b> heat. Various sauté methods exist, and sauté pans are a specific type of pan designed for sautéing.|$|R
50|$|One {{traditional}} {{recipe for}} cranachan is 3 oz pinhead oatmeal, 1/2 imppt ml double (or whipping) cream, and 2 tablespoons (35 ml) of whisky. The oatmeal should be toasted in a <b>pan</b> <b>over</b> a <b>high</b> heat then dust should be sifted out. The oatmeal is soaked in whisky overnight {{and then added}} to the whipped cream, {{with a little more}} whisky added to the mixture. Some raspberries are placed {{in the bottom of the}} serving glass before adding the cream mixture. An option is to break up some of the raspberries and gently blend into the mixture. The volume of whisky used may be adjusted to personal taste.|$|R
40|$|Usually waders (Aves, Charadrii) feed in the {{inter-tidal zone}} over the low tide period and roost <b>over</b> <b>high</b> tide. But {{occasionally}} when their energetic needs increase, due to {{adverse weather conditions}} or to a need to store fat to fuel migration, the birds also feed during high tide, sometimes in agricultural land. At the Ria de Aveiro, about 44 % (corresponding to 4500 birds) of the wintering dunlin (Calidris alpina) use artificial salt pan habitats throughout the winter whilst the others utilize natural intertidal habitats, mainly mudflats. The dunlin that feed intertidally in natural areas, such as the Canal de Mira, do not feed <b>over</b> <b>high</b> tide. In contrast, the birds that use the salt pan area feed both during low tide, in abandoned salt pans whose walls are breached and thus allow access to the tide, and high tide, in active salt pans, and keep on doing so throughout the winter. The energetic needs of both groups of birds {{are thought to be}} similar. However, the benthos of the abandoned salt pans seem to be different, and poorer in energetic terms, from those of the natural mudflats. It is argued that dunlin wintering in the salt pan area must compensate for this by feeding <b>over</b> <b>high</b> tide in active salt pans. Rather than just being a means of obtaining more energy at certain times of high energy demand, it would seem that feeding in active salt <b>pans</b> <b>over</b> <b>high</b> tide should be considered as a normal component of the feeding strategy of these birds, a strategy that is different from those wintering in the natural mudflats. These findings highlight the importance of the salt exploitation industry to waders and also show that artificial habitats can support large numbers of wintering waders...|$|R
50|$|Different {{cultures}} and language {{tend to have}} their own unique ways of cooking and each of them has different terminologies which often come from historical necessities. Traditional cooking methods in Malay cuisine are quite similar to life in Malay villages, slow and laidback as most authentic Malay delicacies cooked on low heat for a long time as compared to Chinese food. There are numerous methods of cooking terminologies that are used in Malay cooking that consist of dry and moist methods. Tumis (use a small amount of oil or fat in a shallow <b>pan</b> <b>over</b> relatively <b>high</b> heat), salai (smoked or grilled food on the fire such as dried fish and the ingredients are usually cut into pieces or thinly sliced to facilitate fast cooking), sangai (method of cooking whereby food mainly dries spices are frying without oil), layur (warm over low heat to dry) are examples of terminologies for dry-heat cooking methods. On the other hand, moist-heat cooking method includes terms such as tanak (cooking in a pot especially rice), jerang (boiling or simmering normally used of liquids), celur (blanching or dipping something such as vegetable into the hot water) and reneh (simmering or boiling food).|$|R
