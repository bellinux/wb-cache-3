50|$|The only {{video game}} Ash has truly {{appeared}} in {{to date is}} Pokémon Puzzle League, where he tries to become a Pokémon <b>Puzzle</b> <b>Master.</b> This game was never released in Japan.|$|E
50|$|As a <b>puzzle,</b> the <b>Master</b> Edition is {{actually}} simpler {{than the original}} Rubik's Magic. It offers more degrees of freedom (more hinges), allowing you to work on one part, mostly ignoring the other parts. The minimal solution involves 16 quarter turns moves. There are multiple solutions.|$|R
50|$|The {{team who}} {{correctly}} solved the <b>master</b> <b>puzzle</b> earned an additional 100 points, while an incorrect solution passed {{control to the}} other team. The trailing team began each subsequent round.|$|R
50|$|Two teams, each {{consisting}} of two celebrities and one contestant, competed to solve clues to crossword puzzles. Each word in the puzzle was also a clue to a <b>master</b> <b>puzzle.</b>|$|R
50|$|Shortz {{began his}} career at Penny Press Magazines, then moved to Games {{magazine}} for 15 years, serving as its editor from 1989-1993. He has been the crossword puzzle editor for The New York Times since 1993 (the fourth in the paper's history, following Eugene Thomas Maleska), and has been the <b>puzzle</b> <b>master</b> on NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday since the program was started in 1987. He {{is the founder of}} the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament (1978), and has served as its director since that time. He founded the World Puzzle Championship in 1992 and is a director of the U.S. Puzzle Team.|$|E
5000|$|He {{compiled}} a best-selling quiz book series Atama no Taisō (頭の体操, literally Head Gymnastics), from 1966 to his death. There are 23 sequel parts published. He was {{also known for}} designing the puzzles of video games, including the Professor Layton series, {{in which he is}} cited as a [...] "Puzzle Master" [...] in the credits. In the titular Professor Layton's office, the player can also find a book which the professor is reading written by a <b>puzzle</b> <b>master</b> from abroad--as the games take place in the UK, this is likely referring to Tago. He {{died at the age of}} 90 in March 2016.|$|E
50|$|Not {{long after}} the events of Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box, {{archaeologist}} and <b>puzzle</b> <b>master</b> Professor Hershel Layton and his young apprentice Luke Triton reminisce over one of their earliest adventures together from three years ago: Layton is invited by his former student Janice Quatlane to watch her perform in an opera at the Crown Petone opera house, which is built on the White Cliffs of Dover. The performance centers on the legendary lost land of Ambrosia and the secret of eternal life it holds, which will be rediscovered when its queen returns. Janice believes recent strange occurrences are somehow connected to the opera: girls have disappeared from London, and the opera's composer, Oswald Whistler, has recently adopted a young girl who has claimed to be his deceased daughter Melina. Whistler plays the entire opera on the Detragon, an elaborate one-man orchestra machine. Once the performance is complete, a mystery man informs the audience that they are to play a game, the winner of which will receive the secret of eternal life, while the losers will die. Several {{members of the audience}} try to escape, but the floor opens up beneath them and they disappear. Inspector Grosky tries to arrest the mystery man, but the man is a puppet which inflates and floats out of the theater, taking Grosky with him.|$|E

50|$|Basically, {{the game}} {{was the same as}} its American counterpart, except that there were two players (one celebrity and one contestant) on each team instead of three. As in the American version, teams took turns solving words in a crossword puzzle (by virtue of clues), all of which are clues to a <b>master</b> <b>puzzle.</b> Each correct answer keeps control and earns one point per letter in the answer plus a chance to solve the <b>master</b> <b>puzzle</b> for 10 bonus points. On the first two series, which had been {{transmitted}} weekly, the teams played for pounds. Later in the run, teams always took turns whether they were right or wrong.|$|R
50|$|The champions earned one {{bank card}} {{for winning the}} game and played a new <b>Master</b> <b>Puzzle</b> game to earn up to nine {{additional}} cards {{for a total of}} ten. The couple was given up to six clues to try to identify the puzzle, and each of the clues had a corresponding value of bank cards it would cost them to reveal it. Clues cost one, two or three bank cards, and were distributed by a shuffle that the couple stopped manually. They were then revealed in a clockwise fashion. The couple was given a guess at the <b>Master</b> <b>Puzzle</b> after each clue was revealed. A correct guess at any time earned the couple the amount of bank cards remaining.|$|R

40|$|Motivation: Next {{generation}} sequencing {{technologies have}} revolutionized {{our ability to}} rapidly and affordably generate vast quantities of sequence data. Once generated, raw sequences are assembled into contigs or scaffolds. However, these assemblies are mostly fragmented and inaccurate at the whole genome scale, {{largely due to the}} inability to integrate additional informative datasets (e. g. physical, optical and genetic maps). To address this problem, we developed a semi-automated software tool-Genome <b>Puzzle</b> <b>Master</b> (GPM) -that enables the integration of additional genomic signposts to edit and build 'new-gen-assemblies' that result in high-quality 'annotation-ready' pseudomolecules. Results: With GPM, loaded datasets can be connected to each other via their logical relationships which accomplishes tasks to 'group,' 'merge,' 'order and orient' sequences in a draft assembly. Manual editing can also be performed with a user-friendly graphical interface. Final pseudomolecules reflect a user's total data package and are available for long-term project management. GPM is a web-based pipeline and an important part of a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) which can be easily deployed on local servers for any genome research laboratory...|$|E
5000|$|El Caracol: Spanish for [...] "the snail" [...] {{due to its}} shape. In actuality, {{this was}} an {{observatory}} used by the Mayans to calculate their calendar via study of the stars. In the game, it primarily serves {{as a means of}} redirecting the Suns rays to solve certain <b>puzzles.</b> The Snake <b>Master</b> is found here.|$|R
50|$|The {{winning team}} was shown one last crossword puzzle, with 10 words {{none of which}} are clues to a <b>master</b> <b>puzzle.</b> The host reads rapid-fire clues {{to each of the}} 10 words. Each correct words brings the winning team extra closer to a holiday for the contestant, and if they can solve all ten in 60 seconds or less, they'll win the holiday, {{otherwise}} the winning player wins consolation prizes.|$|R
5000|$|After {{correctly}} {{solving a}} word the contestant could select {{another word for}} the other celebrity on his/her team to guess or attempt to identify the subject the <b>master</b> <b>puzzle.</b> If he/she elected to attempt to guess the subject, the contestant would ask Clark for a [...] "conference" [...] with the celebrities and was given seven seconds to discuss an answer. Once the conference was over, the contestant was prompted for an answer.|$|R
60|$|The dog {{turned the}} sheep {{and brought them}} back through another opening, after which they raced towards the hurdles, and the collie hesitated as if <b>puzzled</b> by its <b>master's</b> shouts. The sheep were {{near the end of}} the rails, but it was not the end the card indicated. Then the dog seemed to {{understand}} what was required, and circling round the flock with swift, graceful leaps, drove them along the hurdles and round the other end.|$|R
50|$|The {{contestant}} {{with the}} most points {{at the end of}} the game played the Crossfire Round along with his/her choice of celebrity partner (a choice of only the winning player's partners in 1975 and a choice of all four in 1986). The team was shown one last crossword puzzle with ten words, none of which were clues to a <b>master</b> <b>puzzle.</b> The team called out words by number and the host read the clue for that word. If the team could solve all ten words in 60 seconds or less, they won the grand prize.|$|R
5000|$|The {{category}} of the <b>master</b> <b>puzzle</b> was given {{at the beginning of}} each round. The contestant captain chose which position in the crossword puzzle to identify, and which star to play that position. A crossword clue to that word was then read. If the star couldn't answer the clue within seven seconds, the contestant could answer. However, if neither the celebrity nor the contestant answered correctly, control passed to the opposing team. Each correct answer awarded 10 points per letter in the word (e.g., if the word was [...] "scientist", correctly solving the word would be worth 90 points).|$|R
60|$|He divined {{that one}} of his enemy's {{purposes}} was to secure the personal property, as well as the estate, to his son: or rather himself; yet why he did not wait till his decease was a <b>puzzle</b> to my <b>master,</b> because ignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together. However, he felt that his will had better be altered: instead of leaving Catherine's fortune at her own disposal, he determined {{to put it in the}} hands of trustees for her use during life, and for her children, if she had any, after her. By that means, it could not fall to Mr. Heathcliff should Linton die.|$|R
5000|$|Like in America, {{the couple}} with a correct guess gets to choose two letters {{that are in}} the <b>master</b> <b>puzzle</b> (they'll call theirs the [...] "Main Phrase Puzzle"). They'll choose letters from a {{keyboard}}. The keyboard contained all 26 letters, plus a star, which is used to represent markings other than letters such as apostrophes or hyphens. Letters {{that are in the}} puzzle are highlighted on the keyboard, plus, one letter that is not in the puzzle, which is called a [...] "stinger" [...] which if picked, caused the team to lose a turn. For each letter revealed in the word, £10 is added to a bank, and the team that correctly solves the puzzle won the pot.|$|R
40|$|Among {{the many}} feats of {{learning}} that children showcase in their development, syntactic abilities appear long before many other skills, such as riding bikes, tying shoes, or playing a musical instrument. This is achieved {{with little or no}} direct instruction, making it both impressive and even <b>puzzling,</b> because <b>mastering</b> natural language syntax {{is one of the most}} difficult learning tasks that humans face. One reason for this difficulty is a “chicken-and-egg” problem involved in acquiring syntax. Syntactic knowledge can be characterized by constraints governing the relationship between grammatical categories of words (such as noun and verb) in a sentence. At the same time, the syntactic constraints presuppose the grammatical categories in terms of which they are defined; and the validity of grammatical categories depends on how they support those same syntactic constraints. A similar “bootstrapping ” problem faces a student learning an academic subject such as physics: understanding momentum or force presupposes some understanding of the physical laws in which they figure; yet these laws presuppose these very concepts. The bootstrapping problem solved by very young children seems much more daunting, both because the constraints governing natural language are so intricate, and because these children do not have the intellectual capacity or explicit instruction present in conventiona...|$|R
5000|$|Once the <b>Master</b> <b>Puzzle</b> was solved, {{the couple}} entered the Prize Vault, where the forty bank cards were {{displayed}} on a game board for them to select from. Thirty-eight of the cards had either a cash or merchandise prize attached to it them, and the code reader would display {{the names of the}} prizes associated with each card. One of the remaining two cards still broke the bank, while the other was referred to as the [...] "Bankrupt card". This card was always in play every time a couple returned to the Prize Vault, and if they found it they lost any prizes they had won on that day and the round ended. The couple chose cards one at a time and could stop at any time, with any unread cards placed back on the board.|$|R
