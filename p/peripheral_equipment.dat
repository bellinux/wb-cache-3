The technique of mea-suring point velocities along three axes simultaneously is approached in two phases: Firstly, recording of the velocity data, and secondly reproducing the velocity data. The system involves utilization of voltage data recorder which can translate the flow velocities obtained by sensor probes picking up the acoustic interference. A data acquisition control unit, a desk-top computer and <b>peripheral</b> <b>equipments</b> which con-sist of distribution channels, printer and plotter terminals provide the necessary interpretation of the flow behaviour. When fluid flow through a curved open channel, {{there will be a}} steady redistribution of the velocities due to the interaction of the frictional, centrifugal and inertial forces.

Presently, microcomputer {{has been used as}} an alternative to the standard Delta Modulation PWM technique.

The microcontroller based delta modulated PWM for 3 -phase inverter has been proposed in this project in order to get better solution for the control of inverter. The simulation of Delta Modulation techniques is carried out using PROTEUS ISIS 7. 0 in order to get six modes of delta modulated PWM switching scheme.
