5|$|Between 1965 and 1967, the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration, the United States Bureau of Mines, the United States Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, the United States Geological Survey, and the Pennsylvania Department of Mines and Mineral Industries {{conducted}} a joint {{study on the}} watershed of Black Creek. The <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> to deal with water pollution due to acid mine drainage. Geological field work {{was carried out in}} the area between October 1965 and December 1965. Core and rock cuttings were done between October 1966 and June 1967. However, this study was ended before all of the necessary scientific investigations were completed.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Oscar {{and other}} leaders of the Marulu Project {{approached}} the George Institute for Global Health (The George) regarding the possibility of conducting {{a study on the}} prevalence of FASD in Fitzroy Valley. The George had previously developed Yajilarra (2009), a documentary film on Oscar’s group of Aboriginal women’s campaign to limit alcohol consumption in Fitzroy Valley, and was considered a suitable organisation to provide medical research services to the project. The <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> to discover how many children were affected by FASD, attract funding and resources to provide care for the children affected, and prevent the disorder from occurring.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, Healey & Baker's Development Team, which is now owned by Cushman & Wakefield, were {{appointed}} by Liverpool City Council to conduct a retail study of the Liverpool City Centre for the replacement Unitary Development Plan. The <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> to enable the Council to identify ways of protecting and improving the City Centre and also {{to find out why}} the City Centre was perceived as unattractive to new high quality retailers. Cushman & Wakefield's study revealed that Liverpool's reputation as a regional shopping centre was under serious threat, but the study underlined that a feasible scheme and redevelopment site existed within the heart of the city.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, Terry-McElarth {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{a study in}} the American Journal of Preventative Medicine on regular soda policies and their effect on school beverage availability and student consumption. The <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> to determine the effectiveness of a program beginning in the 2014–2015 school year that requires schools participating in federally reimbursable meal programs to remove all competitive venues (a la carte cafeteria sales, vending machines, and stores/snack bars/carts), on the availability of unhealthy beverages at schools and student consumption. The study analyzed state- and school district-level policies mandating soda bans and found that state bans were associated with significantly lower school soda availability but district bans showed no significant associations. In addition, no significant correlation was observed between state policies and student consumption. Among student populations, state policy was directly associated with significantly lower school soda availability and indirectly associated with lower student consumption. The same was not observed for other student populations.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, S Heim et al. {{was one of}} {{the first}} studies not to just compare {{dyslexic}}s with a non dyslexic control, but to go further and compare the different cognitive sub groups with a non dyslexic control group. Different theories conceptualise dyslexia as either a phonological, attentional, auditory, magnocellular, or automatisation deficit. Such heterogeneity suggests the existence of yet unrecognised subtypes of dyslexics suffering from distinguishable deficits. The <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> to identify cognitive subtypes of dyslexia. Out of 642 children screened for reading ability 49 dyslexics and 48 controls were tested for phonological awareness, auditory discrimination, motion detection, visual attention, and rhythm imitation. A combined cluster and discriminant analysis approach revealed three clusters of dyslexics with different cognitive deficits. Compared to reading-unimpaired children cluster no. 1 had worse phonological awareness; cluster no. 2 had higher attentional costs; cluster no. 3 performed worse in the phonological, auditory, and magnocellular tasks. These results indicate that dyslexia may result from distinct cognitive impairments. As a consequence, prevention and remediation programmes should be specifically targeted for the individual child's deficit pattern.|$|E
25|$|During {{the years}} {{following}} her dissertation, the research of Anna Christensen came {{to concentrate on the}} law of Welfare Society, i.e. those parts of the legal system that are developed to protect everyday life of the common men and women; Labour Law, Housing Law and Social Security Law were all to become her domain and main fields of research. In Disqualification from Unemployment Benefits (Avstängning från arbetslöshetsförsäkring), from 1980, Christensen studied the Swedish rules on disqualification from unemployment benefits on the ground of refusal of work and other self-imposed unemployment. The main <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> to disclose the control and steering of the citizens that is built into the Swedish social security system. According to Christensen, there was a strong interest {{on the part of the}} state to conceal the role that the Job Service played in the system. Furthermore, Christensen meant that the state had an interest in concealing how the behavior-steering and repressive functions of the social security system were inseparably associated with the supportive functions of the system – a fact that contradicted the ideology surrounding the Welfare State. The study represented an important shift in Christensen’s research towards a more theoretical, social-science-oriented and critical approach.|$|E

In 2005, Woodhull again coordinated with the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in order to organize an event known as [...] "Red, White and Leather for Independence Day", in which over 30 leather bars in 17 cities took part.
