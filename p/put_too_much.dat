5|$|Another project {{combining}} the T-34 tank chassis with the D-15 gun was also considered. Designated SU-D15, the medium assault gun {{was intended as}} a replacement for the SU-122. Although the project received a lot of support from the authorities it never entered production, both because of its shortcomings (the heavy gun <b>put</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> strain on the suspension and ammunition stowage was too limited) and because it was made redundant by the ISU-152. However lessons learned mounting a powerful gun in the T-34 allowed for rapid development of the SU-100 tank destroyer.|$|E
5|$|Legal & General {{worked with}} the local {{community}} to secure support for the project, establishing the St Giles Renaissance Forum in 2002 as {{a focal point for}} local residents, community groups and stakeholders to collaborate on plans to regenerate St Giles. Plans for the development were unveiled in February 2004 and in January 2005 Legal & General made a planning application to begin construction. The scheme was opposed by a number of local residents' groups which complained that it would constitute an overdevelopment of the site, would <b>put</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> strain on local transport and that there was too little residential accommodation on the site.|$|E
5|$|Situational {{awareness}} {{was also}} reduced because the pilots {{did not have}} a chart in front of them at all times. The crew was not aware that they could check the aircraft location in relation to the centerline with a VDF. The crew probably <b>put</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> emphasis on the indications displayed by the GPS. The aircraft descended into mountainous terrain without control over the lateral navigation. Despite uncertainty and disagreement in the group, the approach was not abandoned, as the aircraft should have climbed to a safe altitude while the problem was solved.|$|E

5|$|Darah dan Doa was {{released}} in 1950 and distributed by Spectra Film Exchange. It was given the English title The Long March, which the American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests is {{a reference to the}} Chinese Long March of 1934. Not long after the film's release, a two-pronged controversy grew around it, which resulted in the film being banned in parts of the country. Members of other military divisions considered the film to <b>put</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> emphasis on Siliwangi's role, while members of the general public had difficulty believing that Darul Islam could have betrayed the national cause. Ultimately the film required President Sukarno's permission to be re-released in September 1950, after he received a private screening at the Presidential Palace in mid-1950. However, several scenes had to be cut.|$|E
5|$|Standing {{six feet}} tall, O'Neill was {{compared}} to Don Bradman upon his entry into Test cricket. At his best, he was a dynamic stroke maker who was a crowd favourite because {{of his ability to}} score at a high pace, in particular with his power off the back foot. He was noted for his nimble footwork, which he used to negate spin bowling; however this slowed in his later career as he put on weight. O'Neill particularly liked to sweep the slower bowlers. He often <b>put</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> emphasis on his right hand, allowing a large space between his hands on the bat handle, and then turning his right shoulder too square towards the bowler. The renowned English batsman and captain Wally Hammond said that O'Neill was the best all-round batsman he had seen since World War II. O'Neill's tall build, strength and good looks also drew comparison to his boyhood idol Keith Miller. Despite the comparisons to Bradman, O'Neill was much taller and broader, and was often impetuous whereas Bradman was known for his patience and lack of rashness. O'Neill was also criticised for hitting across the line early in his innings.|$|E
5|$|Once Chrono Trigger was completed, {{the team}} resumed discussions for Final Fantasy VII in 1995. The team {{reviewed}} {{the option of}} continuing the 2D strategy, {{which would have been}} the safe and immediate path just prior to the imminent industry shift toward the future of 3D gaming, and the radical new development models that these 3D consoles would require. The team decided to take the riskier option and make a 3D game on new generation hardware, but had yet to choose between the cartridge-based Nintendo 64 or the CD-ROM based PlayStation from Sony Computer Entertainment. The team also considered Sega's new Saturn console and the Microsoft Windows personal computer (PC). Their decision was influenced by two things: a tech demo based on Final Fantasy VI created using the new Softimage 3D software that impressed both staff and external developers, and the escalating price of cartridge-based games, which was limiting Square's audience. Tests were made for a Nintendo 64 version of the game, which would use the planned 64DD peripheral, {{even in the face of}} a lack of 64DD development kits and the prototype device's changing hardware specifications. This version was discarded during early testing, as the 2000 polygons needed to render the Behemoth monster <b>put</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of a strain on the Nintendo 64 hardware, causing a low frame rate. It was later estimated that it would have required thirty 64DD discs to run Final Fantasy VII properly with the data compression methods of the day. Faced with both technical and economic issues on Nintendo's current hardware, and favorably impressed by the increased storage capacity of CD-ROM when compared to the Nintendo 64 cartridge, Square shifted development of Final Fantasy VII in addition to all other planned game projects, onto Sony's PlayStation.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, the American Kennel Club (AKC) is {{the primary}} {{registry}} for purebred dogs, and first recognized the Australian Shepherd in 1991 {{as a member of}} the Herding group. However, many Aussie breeders felt the AKC <b>put</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> emphasis on breed conformity and not enough on performance, so the ASCA declined to join the AKC. Those breeders who felt that AKC membership had its advantages split off from ASCA to form their own Australian Shepherd club, the United States Australian Shepherd Association, created their own breed standard, and joined the AKC in 1993. The decision about affiliation with the AKC remains controversial, as it does with many performance breeds.|$|E

25|$|Bernard Williams {{has argued}} that consequentialism is alienating because it {{requires}} moral agents to <b>put</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> distance between themselves and their own projects and commitments. Williams argues that consequentialism requires moral agents to take a strictly impersonal view of all actions, since {{it is only the}} consequences, and not who produces them, that are said to matter. Williams argues that this demands too much of moral agents—since (he claims) consequentialism demands that they be willing to sacrifice any and all personal projects and commitments in any given circumstance in order to pursue the most beneficent course of action possible. He argues further that consequentialism fails to make sense of intuitions that it can matter whether or not someone is personally the author of a particular consequence. For example, that participating in a crime can matter, even if the crime would have been committed anyway, or would even have been worse, without the agent's participation.|$|E
25|$|The 1996 {{release of}} Byrd's diary of the May 9, 1926, flight {{revealed}} erased (but still legible) sextant sights that sharply differ with Byrd's later June 22 typewritten official {{report to the}} National Geographic Society. Byrd took a sextant reading of the Sun at 7:07:10 GCT. His erased diary record shows the apparent (observed) solar altitude to have been 19°25'30", while his later official typescript reports the same 7:07:10 apparent solar altitude to have been 18°18'18". On {{the basis of this}} and other data in the diary, Dennis Rawlins concluded that Byrd steered accurately, and flew about eighty percent of the distance to the Pole before turning back because of an engine oil leak, but later falsified his official report to support his claim of reaching the pole. Others disagree with Rawlins. In 1998, Colonel William Molett, an experienced navigator published Due north?; Molett maintained that Rawlins had <b>put</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> significance in erased navigational calculations which can be explained by any number of other reasons, including favorable wind speeds as well as simple human error due to stress and lack of sleep. None of Molett's hypotheses explain how Byrd could have observed two completely different sextant altitudes in the same second of time.|$|E
25|$|None of the Peugeots {{finished}} the race, despite Peugeot being favourite {{to win the}} race. The #3 car retired just two hours into the race with a suspension failure, resulting in a broken chassis tub with Pedro Lamy behind the wheel. Sébastien Bourdais the pole-setter did not even get to drive the car. The #2 Peugeot retired with engine problems {{in the early morning}} and an exploding turbocharger while leading the race. This left the sole remaining #1 Peugeot to defend the marque's title. By that time, the #1 Peugeot was running 6th, after dropping 3 laps to replace its alternator. In the closing hour, The #1 Peugeot ran at extremely fast qualifying pace to chase the Audis and eventually overtook the #8 Audi for second position and was on the pace of catching the leading #9 Audi. Unfortunately, the #1 Peugeot also suffered an engine failure, almost identical to its sister car. In a post-race analysis by Peugeot, the #3 damage was the suspension mounting point separating from the carbon fiber tub, causing an undetected structural problem that forced the #3 to retire. The #2 and #1 car, as well as the #4 Oreca that suffered the same engine failure as the other two about slightly over an hour left in the race, was caused by the increased stress of the engines (particularly the connecting rod) that caused the engine failures, partially because of the pace the Audis were going at. In particular this race had perfectly dry weather and therefore no rain would slow the pace of these LMP1, which might have also <b>put</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> stress to the Peugeot engines as well as the reason for the distance record.|$|E
