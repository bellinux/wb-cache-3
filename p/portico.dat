5|$|In Virginia and Carolina, the Palladian {{manner is}} epitomised in {{numerous}} Tidewater plantation houses, such as Stratford Hall or Westover Plantation, or Drayton Hall near Charleston. These examples are all classic American colonial {{examples of a}} Palladian taste that was transmitted through engravings, {{for the benefit of}} masons—and patrons, too—who had no first-hand experience of European building practice. A feature of American Palladianism was the re-emergence of the great <b>portico,</b> which again, as in Italy, fulfilled the need of protection from the sun; the <b>portico</b> in various forms and size became a dominant feature of American colonial architecture. In the north European countries the <b>portico</b> had become a mere symbol, often closed, or merely hinted at in the design by pilasters, and sometimes in very late examples of English Palladianism adapted to become a porte-cochere; in America, the Palladian <b>portico</b> regained its full glory.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} feature of Drayton Hall, its two-storey <b>portico,</b> was derived directly from Palladio.|$|E
5|$|The {{frontage}} {{and principal}} {{entrance of the}} Town Hall face the River Roch, and comprises a <b>portico</b> of three arches intersected by buttresses. Decorating the main entrance are stone crockets, gargoyles, and finials. Four gilded lions above a parapet around three sides of the <b>portico</b> bear shields carrying the coats of arms of Rochdale Council and the hundred of Salford.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSupermarkets {{and shops}} use {{anti-theft}} store protection gates {{to avoid the}} theft of their products. These devices consist generally in two parallel <b>porticoes</b> containing one or several vertical loop antennas. The customers of the supermarket pass between both <b>porticoes</b> and it results from it an exposure of the customers to the magnetic field radiated by antennas. The study evaluates numerically this exposure {{in the case of}} a pair of three loops antenna <b>porticoes...</b>|$|R
50|$|Three <b>porticoes</b> of {{the facade}} are located head-on. The Pashkov House {{is a rare}} sample in the global architecture, where three <b>porticoes</b> are used for such facade arrangement, which are {{absolutely}} similar by their main dimensions and number of columns. Only the order used is different.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of November 21, 1970, a dynamite-fueled bomb {{exploded}} underneath the <b>portico,</b> doing $170,000 in damage. Though no one was injured, windows were blown out, the Council Chamber (located above the blast) was damaged, all of the columns of the <b>portico</b> were damaged and replaced, and the Liberty Bell replica was a complete loss. A new bell was purchased for $8,000 and later moved to Terry Schrunk Plaza. No one was ever arrested or claimed responsibility for the bombing.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} facade, oriented {{southwest and}} located behind the <b>portico,</b> was built {{together with the}} stone church built by the Jesuits in 1727. The facade is simply designed with its upper half hidden by an extended choir loft which houses an 1824 pipe organ. A way of glazed blue tiles connects the facade and the <b>portico.</b> The <b>portico</b> was added as an extension to the facade in 1875 by the Augustinian Recollects. An inscription on the portico's pediment based on the year of construction of the facade (1875) was invisible due to church renovations. Two religious images, both dated 1885, is found on the portico's niches: St. Joseph and the child Jesus on the uppermost niche and the Immaculate Conception, patroness, on the central niche.|$|E
5|$|The other {{buildings}} erected nearby {{at that time}} have since disappeared, but the monumental access gate and <b>portico</b> {{in the north of}} the mosque are preserved from the original structure.|$|E

50|$|The {{cityscape}} {{is further}} enriched by its elegant and extensive <b>porticoes,</b> {{for which the}} city is famous. In total, there are some 38 km of <b>porticoes</b> in the city's historical centre (over 45 km in the city proper), which {{make it possible to}} walk for long distances sheltered from the elements.|$|R
50|$|Moreover, two {{magnificent}} <b>porticos,</b> both {{built in}} the tradition of Republican-era <b>porticoes,</b> were built {{toward the end of the}} 1st century BC: the Porticus Octaviae and the Porticus Philippi. The first was built by Augustus, who dedicated it to his sister Octavia, the second was erected by his stepfather Philippus.|$|R
5|$|The principal, or South façade, is 344feet (104.9m) {{in length}} (from {{each of the}} {{flanking}} wings to the other), its austerity relieved on the piano nobile level only by a great six-columned <b>portico.</b> Each end of the central block is terminated by a slight projection, containing a Venetian window surmounted by a single storey square tower and capped roof, similar to those employed by Inigo Jones at Wilton House nearly a century earlier. A near identical <b>portico</b> was designed by Inigo Jones and Isaac de Caus for the Palladian front at Wilton, but this was never executed.|$|E
5|$|During the Vietnam War the Shrine {{became a}} centre of {{conflict}} when anti-war demonstrators protested during ANZAC Day services against Australia's {{involvement in the}} war. In 1971 the Shrine was defaced when the word PEACE! was painted in large white letters on the pillars of the north <b>portico.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1250, {{relics of}} St. James {{were brought to}} the church and its {{dedication}} was changed. It was usually known in contemporary documents as S. Jacobus de <b>Portico,</b> where the Porticus in medieval Rome was the covered passage linking Saint Peter's with the Tiber (Porticus Sancti Petri).|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, the Cherry family made {{alterations}} to the building, replace some of the house's original <b>porticoes</b> with woodwork of Victorian design. The next owner, Bob Guinn, undertook in 1935-36 to restore the <b>porticoes</b> to their original design, based on recollections of living members of the Cherry family. The restoration of the <b>porticoes</b> {{was part of a}} more extensive restoration and remodeling project, based on design plans by Memphis architect Hubert T. McGee, that included addition of a new kitchen and bath facilities, replacing weatherboard on the east wall with brick, and adding emphasis to the house's west front.|$|R

5|$|In 1977, after {{a fire in}} March 1976, Amtrak {{undertook}} a $314,000 rehabilitation of the station. The roof and <b>portico</b> were rebuilt, {{two of the three}} dormers removed, new restrooms added, and the platform and waiting room repaired. The loggia, windows, and other openings were covered with cinderblocks and brick.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century, Scotland's rapidly {{expanding}} economy and population resulted in the laying out of numerous new towns and remodelled settlements, resulting in a need for new churches to support the local residents. These included St Andrew's and St George's West Church, George Street, in the New Town of Edinburgh, designed by Andrew Frazer (1782–87), followed in the tradition of Gibbs, with an oval plan, tetrastyle Corinthian <b>portico</b> and a tall steeple. The builder, Alexander Stevens, probably also designed the steeple of St Cuthbert's Church (1789–90). At Fochabers, from 1776 John Baxter redesigned the village on a grid plan, with a central square focused on Bellie Church (1795–97), still following in the tradition of Gibbs, with a tetrastyle <b>portico</b> and steeple.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Ellwood's 1898-1899 renovations were superficial, {{especially}} {{when compared to}} the alterations his son made to the original design a decade later. He had the bracketed cornice replaced with a Classical cornice with dentils and a projecting molding. The window lintels were altered in a style similar to the new cornice. On the tower, the two windows on the first floor were replaced with one larger window while the projecting bay over the east <b>portico</b> was removed and made flush {{with the rest of the}} house. The windows over that <b>portico</b> were replaced with a heavy double door that opened onto the roof over the veranda, which had been built over the entire front of the house. It was during this time that the first porte-cochere was built on the south side of the home.|$|E

5|$|Perry Ellwood {{inherited}} {{the house in}} 1910, and, together with his wife, May Ellwood (née Gurler), altered the mansion once again. The biggest changes were {{the addition of the}} terrace on the home's south face, a sunroom wing, and the relocation of the porte-cochere to {{the north side of the}} <b>portico.</b> This is the mansion that is visible today.|$|E
5|$|The two statues on {{the lawn}} {{in front of the}} National Gallery are the statue of James II by Grinling Gibbons {{to the west of the}} <b>portico,</b> and of one George Washington, a replica of a work by Jean-Antoine Houdon, to the east that was a gift from the Commonwealth of Virginia {{installed}} in 1921.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey {{house has}} a {{symmetrical}} facade with projecting wings {{either side of the}} central doorway with a Tuscan <b>portico.</b> The interior of the stone house is decorated with extensive plaster mouldings to ceilings and fireplaces. The grounds and gardens were laid out by Humphry Repton, but have since been reduced in size.|$|E
50|$|A {{street with}} wide, shop-lined <b>porticoes</b> ran north-south through the city. The {{space between the}} columns of the <b>porticoes</b> was often filled with statues of {{successful}} athletes, most of them wrestlers.

50|$|Although Henbury Hall {{is based}} on the Villa Rotonda, there are {{significant}} differences. The major difference is that it has a smaller plan, with <b>porticos</b> of four rather than six columns. Venetian windows have been inserted behind the <b>porticos.</b> The entrance is at basement, rather than at piano nobile, level, and the profile of the dome is higher.|$|R

5|$|The west {{facade of}} the house is the most ornate, and faces the Hudson River, {{with a view of the}} river from its terrace and west-facing windows. The curtain wall between the facade's pavilions {{contains}} a semicircular <b>portico,</b> and its entablature is upheld by Ionic columns, and supports a balustrade. A flight of semicircular steps descends to the terrace. The river front is parallel with the east front, which had a porte-cochère, a minor entrance, and a service entrance. The main entrance is at the building's south, directly approached by the south drive. The entrance is recessed, with a <b>portico</b> of Ionic columns over the entranceway.|$|E
5|$|Across {{the top of}} {{the ravine}} from Cave 1 on the other Stupa hill is a large hall known as Sitabai's temple cave. The <b>portico</b> has four pillars and two pilasters. The hall has 3 {{chambers}} at the back, the central one a shrine and the rest for monks or priests. The door of the central shrine has pilasters and a frieze, with the threshold decorated with lion figures. The sanctum has no image now, but is similar to Linga shrine on the island.|$|E
5|$|As {{originally}} built, the Federal-style {{house had}} three stories. The completed house had {{four or five}} parlors. It was built of unpainted, cream-colored brick. The entrance was level with the ground, with an oriel window above it {{on the second floor}} and a Palladian window on the third floor above that. An oval <b>portico</b> protected visitors arriving at the front doors.|$|E
