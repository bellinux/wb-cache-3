5000|$|On the {{controversial}} topic of whether allowing derivative work in Hong Kong, intense debate {{occurs in the}} city. People who are against re-creation deem it necessary to introduce legislation to regulate or even prohibit derivative work, with an aim to protect the reputation and interest of the original author. They criticized those involved in derivative work for not respecting copyright. [...] Those against the law amendment reasoned that derivative works encompass too broad a spectrum for the legal restrictions to be justified, and that the amended law could stifle mass creativity, violating the freedom of creation. Criticisms about the emphasis on self-interest of productions were also fired, stating that the new law shows a lack of consideration for the public's right to enjoy derivatives and inhibits the expression of opinions about the original work. It has also been brought out that the original author {{has the right to}} distribute their work, which includes the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> adaptation, selling and all kinds of derivation. As it depends on the acknowledgement of the author, it is doubtful as to whether derivative works violate copyright.|$|E

50|$|Cassin {{compared}} the Declaration to the portico of a Greek temple, with a foundation, steps, four columns, and a pediment. Articles 1 and 2 {{are the foundation}} blocks, with their principles of dignity, liberty, equality, and brotherhood. The seven paragraphs of the preamble—setting out {{the reasons for the}} Declaration—represent the steps. The main body of the Declaration forms the four columns. The first column (articles 3-11) constitutes rights of the individual such as the right to life and the prohibition of slavery. Articles 6 through 11 refer to the fundamental legality of human rights with specific remedies cited for their defense when violated. The second column (articles 12-17) constitutes the rights of the individual in civil and political society (including such things as freedom of movement). The third column (articles 18-21) is concerned with spiritual, public, and political freedoms such as freedom of association, thought, conscience, and religion. The fourth column (articles 22-27) sets out social, economic, and cultural rights including healthcare. In Cassin's model, the last three articles of the Declaration provide the pediment which binds the structure together. These articles are concerned with the duty of the individual to society and the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> of rights in contravention of the purposes of the United Nations Organisation.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the concept of use of force under UN system. It {{discusses}} the meaning of war in general, concentration on the principle of <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> of force. In this respect, the study deals with all ٨ aspects of such principle, including its history and evolution. There are three main stages in the evolution ofsuch principle. The first is the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> of force immediately after the First World War, specifically when the Covenant of the League of Nations was first concluded. The second is the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> of force at the time of concluding the Paris Pact. The third is the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> of force when the UN Charter was concluded, i. e. the period subsequent to the Second World War. The study therefore analyzes Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter which includes this principle. The thesis has also emphasize the right of individual and collective self-defence, as an exception to the principle of the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> of force, through discussing Article 51 of the UN Charter that contains this right, and the relation between Articleand Article 2 (4). Other exceptions that are considered as weak justifications presented by some states to legalize their aggressive actions are included as well. Finally, the study has examined the use of force by the UN forces, focusing on the collective security system in general and the collective measures taken by some bodies suchas the Security Council and the General Assembly to realize the international peace and security. The forces affiliated to the UN are also fully discussed. The conclusions of the study include the results and the recommendations...|$|E

In the case of CFCs, the substitutes used have partially also been substituted because of adverse effects. Besides the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> of hazardous substances, numerous other regulations were issued to reduce unsafe handling and minimize emissions into the environment. It turned out that waste management cannot correct mistakes which already happened “upstream” in the product chain. The control of point sources works quite successfully, whereas today the overwhelming emissions stem from diffuse sources, partially caused by unsafe waste management procedures.|$|E
