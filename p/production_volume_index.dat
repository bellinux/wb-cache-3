40|$|Chip attach is the {{bottleneck}} {{operation in}} semiconductor assembly. Chip attach scheduling is in nature unrelated parallel machine scheduling considering practical issues, for example, machine-job qualification, sequence-dependant setup times, initial machine status, and engineering time. The major scheduling {{objective is to}} minimize the total weighted unsatisfied Target Production Volume in the schedule horizon. To apply Q-learning algorithm, the scheduling problem is converted into reinforcement learning problem by constructing elaborate system state representation, actions, and reward function. We select five heuristics as actions and prove the equivalence of reward function and the scheduling objective function. We also conduct experiments with industrial datasets to compare the Q-learning algorithm, five action heuristics, and Largest Weight First (LWF) heuristics used in industry. Experiment results show that Q-learning is remarkably superior to the six heuristics. Compared with LWF, Q-learning reduces three performance measures, objective function value, unsatisfied Target <b>Production</b> <b>Volume</b> <b>index,</b> and unsatisfied job type index, by considerable amounts of 80. 92 %, 52. 20 %, and 31. 81 %, respectively...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveLeft {{ventricular}} {{end-diastolic volume}} is decreased and ejection fraction is increased after surgical ventricular reconstruction; however, {{the impact on}} left ventricular stroke volume is not well established. MethodsWe analyzed 248 consecutive patients who underwent surgical ventricular reconstruction at a single center. There were 14 perioperative deaths (5. 6 %). The 234 surviving patients had pre- and postsurgical ventricular reconstruction echocardiographic measurement of end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, and stroke <b>volume,</b> each <b>indexed</b> to body size and ejection fraction. A total of 120 patients had echocardiography data at follow-up (median 8 months). ResultsOverall, surgical ventricular reconstruction resulted in reductions in end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (– 30 % ± 18 %) and end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (– 37 % ± 20 %), and increases in ejection fraction (21 % ± 18 % relative increase). However, stroke <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> decreased from 35 ± 8 mL/m 2 preoperatively to 28 ± 7 mL/m 2 early postoperatively (a 17 % ± 24 % relative reduction, P < . 0001); 165 patients (71 %) exhibited a decrease and 69  patients (29 %) exhibited an increase or no change in stroke <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> after surgical ventricular reconstruction. Stroke <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> reduction was strictly related to end-diastolic volume reduction. Patients who initially had a stroke <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> decrease showed recovery, so {{that at the time}} of chronic follow-up there was no significant difference between the groups. Notably, 4 -year survival was approximately 85 % and did not differ between patients with an increase or decrease in stroke <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (P = . 383). ConclusionsAlthough surgical ventricular reconstruction uniformly results in an impressive decrease in end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> and increase in ejection fraction, seemingly indicating beneficial remodeling and improved pump function, systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index,</b> which more directly indexes cardiac pump function, frequently decreases after surgical ventricular reconstruction. Further study is needed to identify baseline characteristics that predict those patients in whom cardiac performance is enhanced by surgical ventricular reconstruction and to clarify whether there is a beneficial impact on exercise tolerance and cardiac output at peak exercise...|$|R

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{sequential}} changes in left ventricular volume after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction, gated radionuclide ventriculography was performed within 12 hours of thrombolysis and at 1 and 6 weeks in 34 consecutive {{patients who received}} intravenous thrombolytic therapy in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Trial. Angiographic confirmation of immediate reperfusion (mean 5. 6 hours after onset of symptoms) that persisted at 24 hours was noted in 24 patients; 10 patients were not reperfused. A small (9. 5 %), but significant (p = 0. 05), increase in end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> was noted in the reperfused group between 1 and 6 weeks; however, a marked degree of dilatation (35 %) was noted in the nonreperfused group (p = 0. 01). The change in left ventricular volume between 1 and 6 weeks differed in the 2 groups for both end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> and end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (p = 0. 01 and p = 0. 02, respectively). By 6 weeks, both end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> and end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> were greater in the nonreperfused group (p < 0. 05). Between the acute and 6 -week studies, definite increases in end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (p < 0. 05) and end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (p < 0. 01) occurred commonly in the nonreperfused group but rarely in the reperfused group. Compared to the nonreperfused group, the reperfused group also had significantly higher ejection fractions at both 1 and 6 weeks (p < 0. 05). The change in end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> between 1 and 6 weeks correlated significantly and inversely with the ejection fraction at 1 week (r = - 0. 60, p < 0. 001). These results indicate that ventricular dilatation occurs between 1 and 6 weeks after myocardial infarction, is proportional to systolic dysfunction and may be largely prevented by successful thrombolytic reperfusion...|$|R

For low volume ENMs where no bulk material is available, the bulk material shows no ecotoxicity, or ecotoxicity of the ENMs is expected due to their physico-chemical properties, a screening test has to be performed.

MethodsBilateral near infrared spectroscopy and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography sensors were placed, and values were recorded immediately before, during, and after regional low-flow cerebral perfusion at 18 °C. Cerebral oxygen saturations, cerebral blood flow velocities, and cerebral blood <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> values were compared by Mann-Whitney U test. Correlations between values of cerebral blood <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> and cerebral blood flow velocity were tested with Spearman rank order correlation. ResultsTwenty patients were studied. Median cerebral oxygen saturations for the right and left sides were 95 % and 95 % before regional low-flow cerebral perfusion, 95 % and 87 % during regional low-flow cerebral perfusion (P =. 054), and 93 % and 94 % after regional low-flow cerebral perfusion. Median cerebral blood flow velocity values did not change during regional low-flow cerebral perfusion. Cerebral blood <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> exhibited a poor correlation with cerebral blood flow velocity. ConclusionsRegional low-flow cerebral perfusion provides comparable blood flows and oxygenation to both cerebral hemispheres. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography is recommended as a corroborative method with near-infrared spectroscopy to guide flow during regional low-flow cerebral perfusion, because cerebral blood <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> does not correlate with cerebral blood flow velocity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether high intensity, long-term aerobic training causes the left ventricle to develop different mechanisms for increasing cardiac output during submaximal and maximal upright bicycle exercise. Fifteen competitive collegiate long distance runners and 14 healthy sedentary adults were studied with use of subcostal view four chamber two-dimensional echocardiography at rest and during and at peak maximal upright bicycle exercise. At rest, the athletes had a larger end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (85 ± 14 ml/m 2) (mean ± 1 SD) than that of the sedentary adults (62 ± 14 ml/m 2) and a larger end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (37 ± 11 versus 21 ± 6 ml/m 2). During low and moderate intensity exercise, end-diastolic and stroke <b>volume</b> <b>indexes</b> increased in both groups, but at high intensity exercise and at peak exercise the end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> of both groups decreased significantly below rest value (athletes, 61 ± 14; sedentary subjects, 46 ± 10 ml/m 2, both p < 0. 001 compared with rest). Reflecting the decreased end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index,</b> at peak exercise, the stroke <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> had decreased from intermediate exercise values in both groups and was not different from rest values. Therefore, although long distance runners have a dilated left ventricle at rest, they utilize the same mechanisms as sedentary adults for increasing cardiac output during upright dynamic exercise. At low and moderate level exercise, the Frank-Starling mechanism is a dominant mechanism for increasing cardiac output, but at peak exercise, probably because of reduced diastolic left ventricular filling, enhanced contractility is the major mechanism for maintaining stroke volume...|$|R
40|$|A {{first pilot}} study of interleukin- 1 {{blockade}} in ST-segment elevation {{acute myocardial infarction}} showed improved remodeling. In the present second pilot study, we enrolled 30 patients with clinically stable ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction randomized to anakinra, recombinant interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist, 100 mg/day for 14 days or placebo in a double-blind fashion. The primary end point was {{the difference in the}} interval change in left ventricular (LV) end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> between the 2 groups within 10 to 14 weeks. The secondary end points included changes in the LV end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index,</b> LV ejection fraction, and C-reactive protein levels. No significant changes in end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index,</b> LV end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index,</b> or LV ejection fraction were seen in the placebo group. Compared to placebo, treatment with anakinra led to no measurable differences in these parameters. Anakinra significantly blunted the increase in C-reactive protein between admission and 72 hours (+ 0. 8 mg/dl, interquartile range - 6. 4 to + 4. 2, vs + 21. 1 mg/dl, interquartile range + 8. 7 to + 36. 6, p = 0. 002), which correlated with the changes in LV end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> and LV end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> at 10 to 14 weeks (R = + 0. 83, p = 0. 002, and R = + 0. 55, p = 0. 077, respectively). One patient in the placebo group (7 %) died. One patient (7 %) in the anakinra group developed recurrent acute myocardial infarction. More patients were diagnosed with new-onset heart failure in the placebo group (4, 27 %) than in the anakinra group (1, 7 %; p = 0. 13). When the data were pooled with those from the first Virginia Commonwealth University-Anakinra Remodeling Trial (n = 40), this difference reached statistical significance (30 % vs 5 %, p = 0. 035). In conclusion, interleukin- 1 blockade with anakinra blunted the acute inflammatory response associated with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction. Although it failed to show a statistically significant effect on LV end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index,</b> LV end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index,</b> or LV ejection fraction in this cohort of clinically stable patients with near-normal LV dimensions and function, anakinra led to a numerically lower incidence of heart failure. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

MethodsA total of 63 patients who had undergone surgical anterior ventricular endocardial restoration and total arterial revascularization were included. Echocardiography and myocardial single photon emission computed tomography were performed to examine LV function and volumes preoperatively, early postoperatively, and annually thereafter to 5 years after surgery. Coronary angiography was performed at 5 years postoperatively. ResultsOperative mortality was 7. 9 % (5 of 63). Echocardiograms performed before discharge demonstrated a significantly improved LV ejection fraction that was maintained at 5 years, significantly decreased early postoperative LV end-diastolic and end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>indexes</b> that were slightly increased at 1 year and then maintained at 5 years, and early postoperative decrement of the stroke <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> that had disappeared at 1 year and had not reappeared by 5 years. Postoperative myocardial single photon emission computed tomography showed an LV ejection fraction that had gradually improved until 2 years and was maintained at 5 years, significantly decreased LV end-diastolic and end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>indexes</b> that were maintained at 5  years, and a stroke <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> that was unchanged until 2 years and slightly increased at 3 to 4 years.

Left atrial size is a known risk factor providing prognostic information in several cardiac conditions. It {{is not known}} if {{this is also the}} case in patients with aortic valve stenosis after aortic valve replacement. MethodsA total of 119 patients with severe aortic valve stenosis scheduled for aortic valve replacement were evaluated preoperatively and divided into 2 groups according to left atrial <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (≥ 40 mL/m 2). Echocardiography was repeated 12 months after surgery. Patients were followed up for 24 months. The primary end point was the composite end point overall mortality and hospitalization due to congestive heart failure. ResultsPreoperative left atrial dilation was associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and increased filling pressure. Preoperative left atrial <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> was associated with persistent abnormalities in left ventricular filling pressure and left ventricular mass index at 1 year after surgery. Event-free survival in patients with left atrial <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> of 40 mL/m 2 or more at 1 year was 71 % compared with 88 % in patients with left atrial <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> less than 40 mL/m 2 (P =. 002). Patients with preoperative increased E/e’ ratio and left ventricular hypertrophy were at increased risk.

SBSE showed wall motion abnormalities in each patient, whereas treadmill did not detect wail motion abnormalities in 4 patients (3 single-vessel; 1 multivessel); of the other 6 patients, 2 showed a lower wall motion score index and 4 did not show any difference in left ventricle kinetics with the 2 methodologies of exercise. Mean acquisition time for postexercise images was 72 +/- 6 seconds. Group B: SBSE resulted in lower work load, heart rate, heart rate x systolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure/end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index,</b> and higher end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> and end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index.</b> Systolic blood pressure was similar with SBSE and treadmill testing.

In the control subjects, pacing caused a decrease in end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (77 +/- 19 [mean +/- SD] ml/M 2 at rest, 50 +/- 18 ml/M 2 at peak pacing; p less than 0. 001), a decrease in end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (34 +/- 14 ml/M 2 at rest, 19 +/- 9 ml/M 2 at peak pacing; p less than 0. 001), an increase in ejection fraction (0. 61 +/- 0. 11 at rest, 0. 66 +/- 0. 11 at peak pacing; p = 0. 006); and no deterioration in wall motion. In 16 patients with coronary artery disease who developed ECG and/or metabolic evidence of ischemia during pacing, end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> decreased (87 +/- 26 ml/M 2 at rest, 69 +/- 24 ml/M 2 at peak pacing; p less than 0. 001), end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> was unchanged (43 +/- 20 ml/M 2 at rest, 44 +/- 21 ml/M 2 at peak pacing; p = NS), ejection fraction decreased (0. 55 +/- 0. 12 at rest, 0. 40 +/- 0. 14 at peak pacing; p less than 0. 001), and new wall motion abnormalities developed in 14. In 11 patients with coronary artery disease but no ECG or metabolic evidence of ischemia, pacing caused a decrease in end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (80 +/- 26 ml/M 2 to 61 +/- 31 ml/M 2; p less than 0. 001), a decrease in end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>index</b> (36 +/- 17 ml/M 2 to 28 +/- 20 ml/M 2; p = 0. 002), no change in ejection fraction (0. 60 +/- 0. 11 to 0. 60 +/- 0. 13; p = NS), and new wall motion abnormalities in four. Although the specificity of these scintigraphic measurements for the identification of patients with coronary artery disease was excellent (1. 0), the combined sensitivity of all scintigraphic measurements was high only if ECG or metabolic evidence of ischemia was present: 0. 94 in patients with evidence of ischemia but only 0. 36 in those without ischemia. Thus radionuclide ventriculography during incremental atrial pacing is useful in the identification of patients with coronary artery disease only if ischemia is induced...|$|R
