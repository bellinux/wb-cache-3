Essentially, they developed a model of stress induced analgesia that was naloxone responsive. Building on <b>prior</b> <b>research,</b> Akil and colleagues established that in the rate inescapable acute stress causes {{a significant increase in}} the opioid peptides, enkephalins and endorphins with a concurrent reduction in pain responsiveness.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1990s, much of Chomsky's {{research}} has focused on what he calls the Minimalist Program (MP), in which he departs from much of his past research and instead attempts to simplify language into a system that relates meaning and sound using the minimum possible faculties that could be expected, given certain external conditions that are imposed on us independently. Chomsky dispenses with concepts such as 'deep structure' and 'surface structure' and instead places emphasis on the plasticity of the brain's neural circuits, along with which comes an infinite number of concepts, or 'Logical Forms'. When exposed to linguistic data, the brain of a hearer-speaker then proceeds to associate sound and meaning, and the rules of grammar that we observe are in fact only the consequences, or side effects, of the way that language works. Thus, while much of Chomsky's <b>prior</b> <b>research</b> has focused on the rules of language, he now focuses on the mechanisms that the brain uses to create these rules.|$|E
25|$|Research on {{alcoholism}} within families has leaned towards exploring {{issues that}} are wrong in the community rather than potential strengths or positives. When researchers conduct research that helps communities, it can be easier for community members {{to identify with the}} positives and work towards a path of resilience. Flawed research design in adult children of alcoholics (ACOA) research showed ACOAs were psychologically damaged. Some flawed research designs include using ACOAs as part of the control group and comparing them to other ACOAs within the same study. This may have caused some limitations in the study that were not listed. When comparing ACOAs to other ACOAs, it is difficult to interpret accurate results that show certain behaviors in the group studied. Research that has been conducted more recently has used control groups with non-ACOAs to see whether the behaviors align with <b>prior</b> <b>research.</b> This research has shown that behaviors were similar between non-ACOAs and ACOAs. An 18 year-long study compared children of alcoholics (COA) to other COAs. In failing to use non-COAs as controls, we miss an opportunity to see if the negative aspects of a person are related to having an alcoholic parent, or are they just simply a fact of life. For example, in Werner’s study, he found that 30% of COAs were committing serious delinquencies. This data would have been more usable if they had viewed the percentage of those committing crimes when compared to non-ACOAs. In a study conducted in a midwestern university, researchers found that {{there was no significant difference}} between ACOA and non-ACOA students. One of the main differences was the student’s views on how they connect their past experiences with their current social-emotional functioning. Students who were ACOAs did not demonstrate issues with their perspective on their interpersonal issues any more than the non-ACA students. However, this study did show that there were other underlying problems in the family structure that may attribute to the perception of not being well adjusted in life.|$|E
