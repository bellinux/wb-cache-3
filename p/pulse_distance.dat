The program profits from the continuous improvement in performance of TESLA cavities, which allows for longer RF-pulses in comparison to the current design.

40|$|Controlled calcium {{carbonate}} precipitation {{can be used}} for various applications. Calcium carbonate precipitation occurs when dissolved calcium and carbonate are mixed at concentrations which exceed the solubility of {{calcium carbonate}}. With alternate injection of pulses of calcium chloride and sodium carbonate solutions in time through a porous medium, dispersion will create a partial mixing zone in space, which moves through the whole system by advective flow. By means of dispersion and advection this should then create a homogeneous calcium carbonate deposit. By varying the concentration of the pulses, the size of the pulses, the distance between the pulses and the flow velocity {{it should be possible to}} control the location and distribution of the precipitated calcium carbonate to a certain extent. To investigate this principle a numerical model is developed, which is based on advective-dispersive-reactive transport equations for multiple dissolved and solid components using Matlab and Orchestra. Different ways of implementation have been tested and the performance of the model has been evaluated. With the final model seven different simulations were performed in which the system variables: concentration, flow rate, pulse duration and <b>pulse</b> <b>distance</b> were varied. These simulations showed that controlled precipitation of calcium carbonate using alternating pulse injections is possible. Increasing the distance between the pulses increases the distance over which the calcium carbonate is distributed, while the amount stays the same. Doubling the solute concentration in the pulse leads to a proportional increase of the amount of calcium carbonate. Doubling the flow velocity or the pulse duration lowers the peak quantity of calcium carbonate but improves the distribution. However, the quantity of precipitated calcium carbonate in all simulations was only 30 % of the expected quantity of calcium carbonate. Further investigations showed a saw tooth pattern near the injection point which indicate that calcium carbonate is dissolving again at a higher rate than anticipated. To prevent this loss of calcium carbonate the model needs to be adjusted by implementing the dissolution kinetics. Secondly the model needs to be validated by experiments.

40|$|AbstractSamples of {{crystalline}} silicon {{for use as}} {{solar cell}} material are structured and hyperdoped with sulfur by irradiation with femtosecond laser pulses under a sulfur hexafluoride atmosphere. The sulfur creates energy levels in the silicon band gap, allowing light absorption in the infrared wavelength regime, which offers the potential of a significant efficiency increase. This Black Silicon is a potential candidate for impurity or intermediate band photovoltaics. In this paper we determine the laser processed sulfur energy levels by deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). We present how the number of laser pulses per sample spot influence the sulfur energy levels and hence the DLTS spectra. Further we show that changing the laser pulse by splitting it with a Michelson interferometer setup results in altered absorption which is most likely due to altered sulfur energy levels. This contribution focuses {{on the possibility of}} controlling the sulfur in Black Silicon through manipulating the laser pulse shape.

40|$|Powerful {{incoherent}} laser pulses can propagate {{in focusing}} Kerr media much longer distances than can coherent pulses, {{due to the}} fast phase mixing that prevents transverse filamentation. This distance is limited by 4 -wave scattering, which accumulates waves at small transverse wavenumbers, where phase mixing is too slow to retain the incoherence and thus prevent the filamentation. However, we identify how this theoretical limit can be overcome by countering this accumulation through transverse heating of the pulse by random fluctuations of the refractive index.

The {{objective was to}} find a combination of laser parameters that could cause over a 600 °C temperature increase at the enamel surface while not damaging enamel, avoiding temperature change above 5. 5 °C in the pulp and increasing enamel erosion resistance. Seventy-seven bovine enamel samples were randomly divided into 6 laser groups and 1 negative control (C/no treatment/n = 11). A scanning strategy (7 × 3 mm) was used for the CO 2 laser treatment (λ = 10. 6 µm, 0. 1 – 18 J/cm 2) with different pulse durations—namely, 20 µs (G 20), 30 µs (G 30), 55 µs (G 55), and 490 µs (G 490), as well as 2 modified <b>pulse</b> <b>distances</b> (G 33 d, G 40 d).

In addition, histology and X-ray diffraction (XRD/n = 10) were performed. Erosion was tested using an erosive cycling over 6 d, including immersion in citric acid (2 min/ 0. 05 M/pH = 2. 3) 6 times daily. Surface loss was measured using a profilometer and statistical analysis with a 2 -way repeated-measures analysis of variance (α = 0. 05).
