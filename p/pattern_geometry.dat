40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} paper, a novel {{conditioning}} method for superabrasive grinding wheels based on surface structuring with ultrashort pulsed lasers is investigated. A picosecond laser (pulse duration tp = 10 ps) is utilised to ablate regular micro patterns into {{the surface of}} CBN grinding tools, aiming to reduce grinding forces and improve grinding efficiency. The proposed structuring method enables {{a high degree of}} control and flexibility regarding <b>pattern</b> <b>geometry</b> and feature size. An analysis of the ablated structures does not reveal any significant thermal deterioration of the abrasive grits resulting from the laser process. Grinding performance and wear behaviour of the structured tools are tested in a face grinding process of hardened steel type 100 Cr 6 (60 HRC). The test results show that the structured tools enable between 25 to 50 % lower forces and significantly improve force stability in long-term grinding operation, due to an enhanced self-sharpening effect of the tool. However, the best surface finish is still achieved with the non-structured tools. The experimental results further indicate that the <b>pattern</b> <b>geometry</b> has a much stronger influence on the grinding behaviour than the degree of structuring (meaning the percentage of active wheel surface compared to a non-structured tool) ...|$|E

40|$|The present {{success in}} the {{manufacture}} of multi-layer interconnects in ultra-large-scale integration is largely due to the acceptable planarization capabilities of the chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) process. In the past decade, copper has emerged as the preferred interconnect material. The greatest challenge in Cu CMP at present is the control of wafer surface non-uniformity at various scales. As the size of a wafer has increased to 300 mm, the wafer-level non-uniformity has assumed critical importance. Moreover, the <b>pattern</b> <b>geometry</b> in each die has become quite complex due {{to a wide range of}} feature sizes and multi-level structures. Therefore, it is important to develop a non-uniformity model that integrates wafer-, die- and feature-level variations into a unified, multi-scale dielectric erosion and Cu dishing model. In this paper, a systematic way of characterizing and modeling dishing in the single-step Cu CMP process is presented. The possible causes of dishing at each scale are identified in terms of several geometric and process parameters. The feature-scale pressure calculation based on the step-height at each polishing stage is introduced. The dishing model is based on pad elastic deformation and the evolving <b>pattern</b> <b>geometry,</b> and is integrated with the wafer- and die-level variations. Experimental and analytical means of determining the model parameters are outlined and the model is validated by polishing experiments on patterned wafers. Finally, practical approaches for minimizing Cu dishing are suggested. Singapore-MIT Alliance (SMA...|$|E
