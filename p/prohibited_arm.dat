40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine Pakistan's place in contemporary U. S. national security strategy. Today, U. S. -Pakistan relations are strained due to the Pressler Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act. The Pressler Amendment <b>prohibits</b> <b>arms</b> transfers from the United States to Pakistan in response to Pakistani efforts to develop a nuclear weapon capability. This thesis provides a historical background to the current impasse by examining Pakistani foreign objectives in South And Southwest Asia. Current security objectives analyzed are the U. S. strategies to contain Iran and Iraq and to preven nuclear proliferation in the region. In order to attain security objectives in the region, the suthor concludes that the U. S. needs a close cooperative relationship with Pakistan. Since the Pressler Amendment stands as the greatest obstacle to improved U. S. -Pakistan relations, the amendment should be repealed. NANAU.

40|$|The Japanese defense {{market is}} an oligopoly. Firms {{in the defense}} {{industry}} also produce civilian goods, and the revenues they obtain from defense contracts are quite small relative to the revenues coming from the production of private goods. Because the Japanese constitution <b>prohibits</b> <b>arms</b> export, the defense industry in Japan essentially serves an internal market. Furthermore, defense contracts are not awarded on a competitive basis. The procurement procedures rely on cost-plus contracts, {{most of which are}} carried out at the discretion of the bureaucrats in charge. Information on prices and contracts thus become extremely opaque, which makes it easier for misuse and corruption to flourish. The paper presents a game that incorporates these features of the defense procurement process. The results of the analysis suggest that the government pay for low-quality defenses goods at inflated prices. Furthermore, because Japanese firms are shielded from competition and {{because of the lack of}} a large foreign market, the Japanese defense industry has no incentive to engage in R&D to improve the quality of its defense goods. ...|$|R

The 1936 treaty confirmed Article 22 of the 1930 treaty remained in force, and [...] "all others Powers invited to express their assent to the rules embodied in this Article". This became known as the London Submarine Protocol, and over thirty-five nations eventually did subscribe to it, including the U.S., Britain, Germany, and Japan.
