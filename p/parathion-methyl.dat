40|$|Volatilisation {{rates of}} five {{pesticides}} (<b>parathion-methyl,</b> endosulfan, fenpropimorph, lindane, trifluralin) applied in formulations were determined from soil surfaces and French beans. Tests were {{performed in a}} wind tunnel under defined conditions (20 deg C, air velocity 1 m/s., relative air humidity 40 - 60 per cent). Volatilised substances in the air were trapped by passing {{a part of the}} whole air stream of the wind tunnel through polyurethane foam. Toluene extracts of the adsorbent were analyzed by gas chromatography. Volatilisation from soil surfaces within 24 hours increased in the order <b>parathion-methyl</b> = fenpropimorph < endosulfan < lindane < trifluralin. For all compounds volatilisation from French beans was higher as compared to volatilisation from soil surfaces. Volatilisation rates from plant surfaces were 50 - 70 per cent for <b>parathion-methyl,</b> endosulfan, fenpropimorph, and lindane. Trifluralin was nearly completely volatilised within 24 hours.

40|$|Calculation of {{pesticide}} volatilization from plants {{as an integral}} component {{of pesticide}} fate models is of utmost importance, especially as part of PEC(predicted environmental concentrations) models used in the registration procedures for pesticides. A mechanistic approach using a laminar air-boundary layer concept to predict volatilization from plant surfaces was compared to data obtained in a wind-tunnel study after simultaneous application of <b>parathion-methyl,</b> fenpropimorph, and quinoxyfen to winter wheat. <b>Parathion-methyl</b> was shown to have the highest volatilization during the wind-tunnel study of 10 days (29. 2 %). Volatilization of quinoxyfen was about 15. 0 %, revealing a higher volatilization tendency than fenpropimorph (6. 0 %), which is attributed to enhanced penetration of fenpropimorph counteracting volatilization. Predictions of the boundary-layer approach were markedly influenced by the selected values for the equivalent thickness of the boundary layer and rate coefficients, thus indicating that future improvements of the approach will require {{a deeper understanding of}} the kinetics of the underlying processes, e. g. phototransformation and penetration. The boundary-layer volatilization module was included in the European registration model PELMO, enabling simultaneous calculation of volatilization from plants and soil. Application of PELMO to experimental findings were the first comprehensive PEC model calculations to imply the relevant processes affecting the postapplication fate of pesticides...|$|E

The identification of trace organophosphorous pesticides in water can be well completed by applying HPLC/APCIMS technique. One on-line analysis can be accomplished with only ten minutes.

40|$|The shear {{horizontal}} {{surface acoustic wave}} (SH-SAW) device was investigated as a micro-chemical sensor for the direct, rapid and in-situ monitoring of chemical contaminants in groundwater and wastewater. The chemical contaminants of interest are organo-phosphate-based compounds (parathion, <b>parathion-methyl,</b> and paraoxon). The polymers used as partially chemically selective coatings are 2, 2 ’-diallylbisphenol A - 1, 1, 3, 3, 5, 5 -hexamethyltrisiloxane (BPA-HMTS), and 2, 2 ’-diallylbisphenol A- polydimethylsiloxane (BPA-PDMS), polyepichlorohydrin (PECH). The experimental {{results indicate that the}} analyte/polymer interaction is a result of mass loading and viscoelastic changes in the polymer. BPA-HMTS, BPA-PDMS, and PECH have the highest to lowest sensitivity towards parathion, <b>parathion-methyl,</b> and paraoxon respectively. The polymers tested at a thickness of 0. 5 μm show a higher (up to 20 kHz) response than the 0. 25 μm-thick polymers due to a more pronounced effect of mass loading and modulus change. The response times of the polymers from fast to slow are PECH, BPA-PDMS, and BPA-HMTS, and the order for the analytes is paraoxon, <b>parathion-methyl,</b> and parathion respectively. An array of sensors consisting of devices with different coatings and thicknesses is designed to increase sensor selectivity, which provides a specific pattern for each analyte. Based on visual pattern recognition, analyte identification is performed, using radial plots with the frequency shift and response times of BPA-HMTS, BPA-PDMS, and PECH at a thickness of 0. 5 μm as input parameters. The concentration of the unknown sample is determined using an algorithm that computes the unknown sample’s distance from the points of the known pattern in the three-dimensional space of the steady-state frequency shifts of the three 0. 5 μm-thick polymer coatings. The probability of the unknown pattern being identical to the known pattern can be determined by a level of confidence. The sensor is tested for stability, sensitivity, and reproducibility via subjection to a real life application simulation. The sensor is exposed to different interferents such as pH levels of 6. 2, 7. 0, and 8. 0 and red clay. The sensor response to the analytes is shown to be unaffected by the presence of these interferents...|$|E
40|$|The single {{interdigital}} transducer (IDT) device was investigated as a micro-chemical sensor {{for the detection}} of organophosphates compounds in aqueous solutions. The compounds of interest are: parathion, <b>parathion-methyl,</b> and paraoxon. The polymers used as a partially-selective coating for the direct detection of these compounds are 2, 22 ̆ 7 -diallylbisphenol A- 1, 1, 3, 3, 5, 5 -hexamethyltrisiloxane (BPA-HMTS) and polyepichlorohydrin (PECH). BPA-HMTS is synthesized here at Marquette University. The measurement of interest for the single IDT is the change radiation resistance. The radiation resistance represents the energy stored in the propagating acoustic wave. As analyte absorbs into the polymer coating, changes in the film 2 ̆ 7 s properties will undergo resulting in a change in the radiation resistance i. e the acoustic wave properties. The film 2 ̆ 7 s properties changing include: added mass, viscoelastic properties, thickness, and dielectric properties. These properties will contribute to an overall change in the radiation resistance. A linear change in the radiation resistance is expected to occur for increasing concentrations of an organophosphate. The experimental results indicate that BPA-HMTS shows greater sensitivity towards the organophosphates than PECH. Both polymers showed greatest to lowest sensitivity to parathion, <b>parathion-methyl,</b> and paraoxon respectively. Thicker films tested for both polymers, 0. 75 μm thick, show a higher response due to a more pronounced effect of mass loading than the thinner films tested, 0. 50 μm. The response times for BPA-HMTS were much faster than for PECH. Both films showed fastest to slowest response time to paraoxon, <b>parathion-methyl,</b> and parathion respectively. The sensor is tested for reproducibility for the polymer BP-HMTS. A sensor array consisting of separately tested devices from this work as well as work done by a previous student is utilized to increase the selectivity of the three organophosphates. Radial plots are performed for each organophosphate and concentration using the change in radiation resistance, response time, and frequency shift for both BPA-HMTS and PECH at 0. 50 μm as input parameters. These plots yield unique recognition patterns for each organophosphate {{that can be used to}} distinguish one from another...|$|E

40|$|Organophosphate {{pesticides}} (OPs) {{have been}} found as contaminants in surface and ground waters, soil, and agricultural products. Because OPs are toxic compounds, rapid detection/monitoring of OPs in groundwater is necessary to allow for real-time remediation. Detection of OPs in water has already been demonstrated using poly(epichlorohydrin) [PECH] and polyurethane as the sensing layers. However, the response times were relatively long, hindering real-time monitoring. In this work, a hybrid organic/inorganic chemically sensitive layer [bisphenol A-hexamethyltrisiloxane (BPA-HMTS) ] that shows {{a high degree of}} partial selectivity for OPs is synthesized, characterized (in terms of the glass transition temperature, Tg, water stability, sensitivity, selectivity, detection limit, and absorption/response time) for the rapid detection of organophosphate pesticides. Direct chemical sensing in aqueous solutions is performed using guided shear horizontal surface acoustic wave sensor platforms on 36 ° rotated Y-cut LiTaO 3 and 42. 75 ° rotated Y-cut Quartz, respectively. It is shown that, for the same coating thickness, a 60 % reduction in sensor response time is achieved without reduction in sensitivity compared to PECH. Considering the Tg, for the polymers, it is seen that the faster response shown by BPA-HMTS is due to the porous siloxane backbone, HMTS. Kinetic studies for the absorption of OPs (<b>parathion-methyl,</b> parathion, and paraoxon) from aqueous solutions into the BPA-HMTS coating are conducted. The data are analyzed within the context of two absorption models: penetration-limited and diffusion-limited absorptions. It is shown that the absorption process is rate limited by penetration with a concentration independent absorption time constant or mass transfer coefficient. The absorption time constants for <b>parathion-methyl,</b> parathion, and paraoxon are calculated. A limit of detection of 60, 20 and 100 μg/L (ppb) for <b>parathion-methyl,</b> parathion, and paraoxon, respectively, is calculated for the present non-optimized sensor. Concentrations as low as 500 μg/L (ppb) parathion are actually measured. This is much lower than the typical concentrations found on agricultural produce (≥ 10 ppm). Furthermore, sensor signal analysis {{in the form of the}} extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed on-line during the detection process. The sensor response was first represented by a state-space model which includes all relevant contributions to the polymer-coated device response. This allows for the steady-state response and absorption time constant to be extracted on-line well before the steady-state is reached, thus further reducing the time for analyte identification and quantification. It is noted the absorption time constant, often unique to a class of analyte-coating pairs, can be used to improve analyte recognition...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was drawn}} between model predictions and experimentally determined volatilization rates {{to evaluate the}} volatilization approaches of European registration models. Volatilization rates of pesticides (C- 14 -labeled <b>parathion-methyl,</b> fenpropimorph, and terbuthylazine and nonlabeled chlorpyrifos) were determined in a wind-tunnel experiment after simultaneous soil surface application on Gleyic Cambisol. Both continuous air sampling, which quantifies volatile losses of C- 14 -organic compounds and (CO 2) -C- 14 separately, and the detection of soil residues allow for a mass balance of radioactivity of the C- 14 -labeled pesticides. Recoveries {{were found to be}} > 94 % of the applied radioactivity. The following descending order of cumulative volatilization was observed: chlorpyrifos > <b>parathion-methyl</b> > terbuthylazine > fenpropimorph. Due to its high air-water partitioning coefficient, nonlabeled chlorpyrifos was found to have the highest cumulative volatilization (44. 4 %) {{over the course of the}} experiment. Volatilization flux rates were measured up to 993 mug m(- 2) h(- 1) during the first hours after application. Parameterization of the Pesticide Emission Assessment at Regional and Local Scales (PEARL) model and the Pesticide Leaching Model (PELMO) was performed to mirror the experimental boundary conditions. In general, model predictions deviated markedly from measured volatilization rates and showed limitations of current volatilization models, such as the uppermost compartment thickness, making an enormous influence on predicted volatilization losses. Experimental findings revealed soil moisture to be an important factor influencing volatilization from soil, yet its influence was not reflected by the model calculations. Future versions of PEARL and PELMO ought to include improved descriptions of aerodynamic resistances and soil moisture dependent soil-air partitioning coefficients...|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} {{resistance}} to acaricides {{in a number of}} populations of the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, in New Zealand had been carried out. Natural genetic and cytoplasmic incompatibilities between populations were also investigated with a view to possible biological control of the pest. Facets of acaricide resistance that were studied included multi-resistance, cross-resistance, negatively correlated resistance and the inheritance of resistance. Chemicals used included an organophosphate representative (<b>parathion-methyl),</b> a carbamate (formetanate), an ungrouped compound (tricyclohexyltin hydroxide) and an organochlorine (dicofol). Cross-resistance was demonstrated between <b>parathion-methyl</b> and formetanate in five populations obtained from widely separate areas of New Zealand. The resistance to parathion of three strains was found to be inherited as a single dominant character and transmissible by both sexes. Cytoplasmic factors (or nucleo-cytoplasmic interactions) and minor genes were found to contribute slightly to the expression of total resistance. No resistance to tricyclohexyltin hydroxide (Plictran) and dicofol (Kelthane) was detected. High degrees of incompatibility (haploid egg lethality) were observed in the hybrids of crosses between the various populations. Chromosomal rearrangements in balanced, heterozygous conditions, in conjunction with the cytoplasm, were considered to be important factors determining the interpopulational sterilities. The interpopulational incompatibility phenomenon was found to be multi-factorial and not associated with the resistance factor. The egg mortalities of some backcross series which remained constantly high in spite of several crossings, implicated that the introduction of normal males to a resistant mite population in an enclosed area (e. g. in a glasshouse) might be a worthwhile proposition in the integrated control of spider mites. Backcross hybrids, on allowing to multiply randomly, were capable of forming new gene combinations, leading consequently to the formation of new strains which were genetically different from the original parents used in the backcross series...|$|E

By using on-line molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE), interferences from sample matrixes can be effectively eliminated. Numerous key variables including affecting the extraction recovery of MISPE have been optimized.

The iLAMP consisted of the competitive immuno-reaction coupled to the LAMP reaction for detection. This method provides positive results in the visual color of violet, while a negative response results in a sky blue color; therefore, the iLAMP allows one to rapidly detect analytes in yes or no fashion.

40|$|In recent years, the {{presence}} of pesticide residues in the air of greenhouses has been a subject of great concern {{in the scientific community}} due to risk to the health of applicants. The present PhD thesis deals with the development of methods for the sampling and simultaneous determination of the fungicide chlorothalonil and its main metabolite 4 -hydroxychlorothalonil as well as the organophosphorous insecticides <b>parathion-methyl,</b> fenthion, diazinon, pirimiphos-methyl και chlorpyrifos in the air of greenhouses. Chlorothalonil and its metabolite are determined using an optimized RP-HPLC with gradient elution. Several procedural parameters are studied including the composition and proportion of solvents in the mobile phase and chromatographic material. Acceptable resolution was attained using a Kromasil C 8 chromatographic column and mobile phase acetonitrile and buffer phosphate 10 mM (pH 5. 0), in less than 20 min. The sampling of the analytes under study is carried out on a glass fiber microfilter for the discrimination of the airborne fraction that is adsorbed on the particulate matter, connected in series with a microcolumn which contains silica gel for the collection of the analytes in gas phase. From the data obtained it is concluded that when the sampled air passes through spiked glass filters an amount of chlorothalonil evaporates and subsequently retained on silica gel filters quantitatively. In this way, the quantitative retention of chlorothalonil is possible, although the discrimination between particulate and gas phase pesticide is feasible. In contrast, the metabolite 4 -hydroxychlorothalonil does not exhibit any evaporation from the glassfiber microfilters. Study of the stability of the above mentioned compounds proves their stability at room temperature and at 4 oC for at least 15 days. Calibration curves for both compounds were constructed in the concentration range of 0. 01 - 10. 00 mg l- 1 with limits of quantitation to be 8. 4 and 19. 6 ng m- 3 for chlorothalonil and 4 -hydroxychlorothalonil, respectively. The potency of the proposed method was further tested with the analysis of chlorothalonil and its metabolite in greenhouse air. Chlorothalonil was detected in all samples even on the 21 st day after application. The 4 -hydroxychlorothalonil was found only in the first four samples after application, at concentrations near the quantification limits. The second part of this thesis concerns the development of analytical method for the sampling and determination of the organophosphorous insecticides <b>parathion-methyl,</b> fenthion, diazinon, pirimiphos-methyl και chlorpyrifos in the air of greenhouses. The determination is performed by an RP-HPLC method isocratically. Successful separation of the studied compounds was obtainable in less than 17 min using a Hypersil BDS C 18 and acetonitrile-buffer phosphate, 10 mM (pH 5. 0) 60 : 40 v/v, as mobile phase. The proposed mode of sampling consists of a glass fiber microfilter for the particulate-sorbed pesticides and a microcolumn containing XAD- 2 for gas phase pesticides. From the experiments carried out on spiked microfilters it is demonstrated that diazinon και pirimiphos-methyl are retained quantitatively on the filters while a break-through is noticed for fenthion, <b>parathion-methyl</b> and chlorpyrifos. Nonetheless, the escaped pesticides are retained completely on the XAD- 2 filters connected in series. The pesticides under study are stable in spiked microfilters for at least fifteen days, at room temperature and at 4 oC. ...|$|E

The percentage inhibition of enzyme activity is correlated to the insecticide concentration. Several parameters influencing the performance of the system are studied and discussed. The detection limits of the insecticides ranged from 0. 5 to 275 ppb. The determination of these compounds was conducted in Hepes buffer and a synthetic sea water preparation. The enzyme reactor can be regenerated after inhibition with a dilute solution of 2 -PAM and be reused for analysis.

40|$|International audienceEnzymatic conductometric biosensor, using immobilized Arthrospira platensis cells on gold {{interdigitated}} electrodes, for {{the detection}} of pesticides in water, was elaborated. Cholinesterase activity (AChE) was inhibited by pesticides and a variation of the local conductivity was measured after addition of the substrate acetylthiocholine chloride (AChCl). The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) was evaluated to be 1. 8  mM through a calibration curve of AChCl. Inhibition of AChE was observed with paraoxon-methyl, <b>parathion-methyl,</b> triazine and diuron with a detection limit of 10 (- 18)  M, 10 (- 20)  M, 10 (- 20)  M and 10 (- 12)  M, respectively and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) was determined at 10 (- 16)  M, 10 (- 20)  M, 10 (- 18)  M and 10 (- 06)  M, respectively. An important decrease of response time τ 90 % was recorded for AChE response towards AChCl after 30  min cell exposure to pesticides.

40|$|Simulation of {{pesticide}} volatilization from plant and soil surfaces {{as an integral}} component {{of pesticide}} fate models is of utmost importance, especially {{as part of the}} PEC (predicted environmental concentrations) models used in the registration procedures for pesticides. Experimentally determined volatilization rates at different scales were compared to model predictions to improve recent approaches included in European registration models. To assess the influence of crucial factors affecting volatilization under well-defined conditions, a laboratory chamber was set-up and validated. Aerodynamic conditions were adjusted to fulfill the requirements of the German guideline on assessing pesticide volatilization for registration purposes. At the semi-field scale, volatilization rates were determined in a wind-tunnel study after soil surface application of pesticides to gleyic cambisol. The following descending order of cumulative volatilization was observed: chlorpyrifos > <b>parathion-methyl</b> > terbuthylazine > fenpropimorph. Parameterization of the models PEARL (pesticide emission assessment at regional and local scales) and PELMO (pesticide leaching model) was performed to mirror the experimental boundary conditions.

40|$|A multiresidue gas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} {{method was}} developed to determine 28 priority pesticides of different chemical families (organochlorine, organophosphorus, triazines, anilides) together with some of their transformation products in river sediment. Ultrasonic, Soxhlet and pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) methods were compared in spiking experiments using acetone:hexane (1 : 1) followed by alumina solid phase extraction cartridges or in-cell alumina clean-up for PLE. All extraction techniques produced acceptable recoveries for the pesticides under study, although Soxhlet extraction produced the lowest recoveries for 2, 4 -DDE, trifluralin, lindane, and hexachlorobenzene (< 50 %) whereas ultrasonic extraction resulted in low recoveries for hexachlorobenzene and lindane (< 50 %). However, PLE using in-cell alumina clean-up produced an overestimation of more apolar compounds, given the amount of coextracted compounds. Limits of detection at the low μg L- 1 -ng L- 1 levels were obtained with Soxhlet and ultrasonic extraction, while PLE produced higher variability {{due to the lack}} of exhaustive clean-up. Given the simplicity of ultrasonic extraction, this method was further employed to determine target compounds in river sediments collected in Portugal. Lindane was detected in practically all samples, followed by trace levels of the pesticides simazine, diazinon, fenitrothion, and <b>parathion-methyl.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Volatilisation of {{pesticides}} from crop canopies {{can be an}} important emission pathway. In addition to pesticide properties, competing processes in the canopy and environmental conditions play a part. A computation model is being developed to simulate the processes, but only some of the input data can be obtained directly from the literature. RESULTS: Three well-defined experiments on the volatilisation of radiolabelled <b>parathion-methyl</b> (as example compound) from plants in a wind tunnel system were simulated with the computation model. Missing parameter values were estimated by calibration against the experimental results. The resulting thickness of the air boundary layer, rate of plant penetation and rate of phototransformation were compared with a diversity of literature data. The sequence of importance of the canopy processes was: volatilisation > plant penetration > phototransformation. CONCLUSION: Computer simulation of wind tunnel experiments, with radiolabelled pesticide sprayed on plants, yields values for the rate coefficients of processes at the plant surface. As some input data for simulations are not required in the framework of registration procedures, attempts to estimate missing parameter values on the basis of divergent experimental results have to be continued...|$|E
40|$|Experimental data on {{airborne}} pesticide {{emissions from}} greenhouses are scarce {{due to their}} generally laborious, complex and costly determination. Therefore modelling may be helpful. USES 2. 0 - a decision-support system for governmental institutions - includes a module to estimate airborne concentrations in the lee eddy within 25 meters of a greenhouse. In a 1998 study this module was used to estimate the concentrations of seven organophosphorous pesticides near greenhouses. The health-based limit values available for these pesticides allowed a preliminary risk assessment to be performed for inhabitants near greenhouses by comparing the estimated concentrations with these limit values. As both limit values and estimated air concentrations {{should be considered as}} being tentative, the outcomes of this risk assessment are indicative. For example, acute effects to inhabitants near a greenhouse due to the exposure to dichlorvos, chlorfenvinphos, mevinphos, parathion, or <b>parathion-methyl</b> cannot be completely excluded during the first hours after application in the greenhouse. Acute effects due to the exposure to azinphos-methyl or diazinon can probably be excluded. As the uncertainty margins for both the exposure and the effect assessment could be considered high, the outcomes of the present study plea for a more refined risk assessment...|$|E
40|$|The {{method for}} {{simultaneous}} determination of 20 organophosphorus pesticide residues in corn samples {{has been developed}} and validated. For the extraction of organophosporus pesticide residues from the samples, the accelerated solvent technique with the mixture of dichloromethane: acetone (1 : 1, V/V) was used. Clean up was done using liquid – liquid extraction with n – hexane, followed by solid phase extraction on primary secondary amine adsorbent, and elution with the mixture of acetone: toluene (65 : 35). The determination of the pesticides {{was carried out by}} gas chromatography with nitrogen phosphorus detection. Separation and quantitative determination of the analytes were performed on a fused silica capillary ZB- 35 column (30 m x 0. 25 mm i. d. x 0. 25 μm, Phenomenex). The recovery was investigated in blank corn samples fortified with mevinphos, diazinon, dimethoate, bromofos-methyl, chlorfenvinphos, fenamiphos, ethion and phosalone at 5 ng/g, 10 ng/g, 15 ng/g, 20 ng/g and 25 ng/g, respectively and with methacrifos, phorate, etrimfos, <b>parathion-methyl,</b> pirimiphos - methyl, fenitrothion, chlorpyrifos, malathion, parathion, bromofos-ethyl, phosmet and azinphos-methyl at 10 ng/g, 20 ng/g, 30 ng/g, 40 ng/g and 50 ng/g, respectively.
