40|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} the second-most {{prevalent}} cancer in young women around the world. Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), especially high-risk HPV types (HR-HPV), {{is necessary for the}} development of this cancer. HPV-DNA detection is increasingly being used in cervical cancer screening programs, together with the <b>Papanicolau</b> <b>smear</b> test. We evaluated the usefulness of introducing this new array-based HPV genotyping method (i. e., Clinical Arrays Papillomavirus Humano) in the cervical cancer screening algorithm in our center. The results obtained using this method were compared to those obtained by the hybrid capture II high-risk HPV DNA test (HC-II) and Papanicolau in a selected group of 408 women. The array-based assay was performed in women that were HC-II positive or presented cytological alterations. Among 246 array-positive patients, 123 (50 %) presented infection with ≥ 2 types, and HR-HPV types were detected in 206 (83. 7 %), mainly HPV- 16 (24. 0 %). Up to 132 (33. 2 %) specimens were classified as ASCUS (for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance), and only 48 (36. 4 %) of them were HPV-DNA positive by either assay; however, 78. 7 % of these cases were caused by HR-HPV types. The agreement between both HPV-DNA detection techniques was fairly good (n = 367). Screening with <b>Papanicolau</b> <b>smear</b> and HC-II tests, followed by HPV detection and genotyping, provided an optimal identification of women at risk for the development of cervical cancer. Furthermore, with the identification of specific genotypes, either in single or multiple infections, a better prediction of disease progression was achieved. The array method also made allowed us to determine the possible contribution of the available vaccines in our setting...|$|E
40|$|Background: One of {{the best}} Public Health {{achievements}} in Chile has been {{the coverage of the}} program for detection and treatment or cervical cancer. Aim: To evaluate the results of the Cervical Cancer Screening Program in Valdivia Health Service (Southern Chile) between 1993 and 2003. Material and methods: Retrospective review of the number of women in whom a <b>Papanicolau</b> <b>smear</b> was obtained in the last three years. The incidence of the disease was calculated using pathological diagnoses of precursor or invasive lesions. Mortality for cervical cancer was calculated using data from death certificates. Results: During 2003, 79 % of women age 25 to 64 years, and 77 % of women aged 35 to 63 years (considered the highest risk group) were screened. We confirmed that the number of precursor lesions detected were increased along with the increasing screening coverage. The diagnosis of carcinoma in situ increased almost three times when compared with 1990 figures. Likewise, the diagnosis of early invasive cervical cancer behaved similarly. Mortality by cervical cancer also experienced a decrease, reaching 4. 6 per 100. 000 women over 15 years old in the Health Service of Valdivia. Conclusions: The sustained increase in cervical cancer screening coverage has had a favorable impact in the morbidity and mortality caused by the diseas...|$|E
40|$|Epidermal {{growth factor}} {{receptor}} (EGFR) and K-ras mutations guide treatment selection in {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) patients. Although mutation status is routinely assessed in biopsies, cytological specimens are frequently the only samples available. We determined EGFR and K-ras mutations in cytological samples. METHODS: DNA was extracted from 150 consecutive samples, including 120 <b>Papanicolau</b> <b>smears</b> (80 %), 10 cell blocks (7 %), nine fresh samples (6 %), six ThinPrep(R) tests (4 %), and five body cavity fluids (3. 3 %). <b>Papanicolau</b> <b>smears</b> were analyzed {{when they had}} > 50 % malignant cells. Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing of exons 18 - 21 of EGFR and exon 2 of K-ras were performed. EGFR mutations were simultaneously determined in biopsies and cytological samples from 20 patients. Activity of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) was assessed. RESULTS: The cytological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma in 110 samples (73 %) and nonadenocarcinoma in 40 (27 %) samples. EGFR mutations were identified in 26 samples (17 %) and K-ras mutations were identified in 18 (12 %) samples. EGFR and K-ras mutations were mutually exclusive. In EGFR-mutated cases, DNA was obtained from stained smears in 24 cases (92 %), pleural fluid in one case (4 %), and cell block in one case (4 %). The response rate to EGFR TKIs in patients harboring mutations was 75 %. The mutation status was identical in patients who had both biopsies and cytological samples analyzed. CONCLUSION: Assessment of EGFR and K-ras mutations in cytological samples is feasible and comparable with biopsy results, making individualized treatment selection possible for NSCLC patients from whom tumor biopsies are not available...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction The raw {{incidence}} of {{cancer of the}} uterine cervix is Spain is 7, 8 per 100. 000 inhabitants (adjusted incidence is 5. 6). The {{incidence of}} this tumor is still low, but a steady increase has been seen, probably related to increasing risk factors. Aim To determine the frequency of infection by different types of human papillomavirus (HPV) in <b>Papanicolau</b> <b>smears</b> from women with and without cancer of the uterine cervix in Spain. Patients and methods A case-control study was performed in women with and without cervical cancer from Zaragoza, Spain. Pap smears from 600 cases (540 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasms (CIN) and 60 with invasive cancer) and 1200 controls (women without those lesions) were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and typed by oligonucleotide microarray-based detection. Results HPV was detected in 93. 3 % of all samples with invasive cancer versus 17. 5 % of controls. OR for invasive cancer was 55 (95 % CI 21. 5 – 140, 5). Statistically significant associations were also found for different grades of cervical dysplasia. Conclusion The strong association found between HPV infection, specifically types 16 and 18 and cancer of the uterine cervix in Zaragoza, Spain, {{stresses the importance of}} ongoing efforts to institute a vaccine program with recently approved HPV vaccines in order to prevent cervical cancer in this population. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Cervical cancer, {{the most}} common cancer among women in Tanzania is {{strongly}} linked to Human Papilloma Virus. Precancerous lesions can be detected by <b>Papanicolau</b> <b>smear</b> screening. Nurses, being {{the largest group of}} health workers, have an important role in promotion of cervical cancer screening. Objectives: To determine nurses ’ awareness of cervical cancer and their own screening practices at a hospital in Tanzania. Methods: A descriptive cross sectional study using questionnaires on 137 nurses. Data analysis was made by descriptive statistics and chi square tests. Results: Less than half of the nurses had adequate knowledge regarding cervical cancer. There was a significant association between knowledge levels of causes of cervical cancer and transmission of HPV and age. Knowledge was more adequate among the young nurses (p = 0. 027) and knowledge differed significantly between cadres. Registered nurses had more adequate knowledge than enrolled nurses (p = 0. 006). The majority did not know screening intervals and a few were aware of HPV vaccine. Most nurses (84. 6 %) had never had a Pap smear examination.

40|$|Study Objective. To {{evaluate}} the clinical efficacy and patient satisfaction of long-term danazol delivered vaginally as treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding. Design. Prospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II- 3). Setting. University hospital. Patients. Twenty premenopausal women with endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial polyps. Intervention. After curettage or hysteroscopic-directed biopsies, women used one 200 -mg tablet of danazol vaginally every day, continuing the therapy {{as long as}} they were totally satisfied with it. Measurements and Main Results. Women were instructed to keep a diary of menstrual bleeding and to rate blood loss on a visual analog scale from zero (no blood loss) to 10 (gushing-type bleeding). They were seen every month for 3 months, then every 3 months for 9 months, and then every 6 months for 4 years for <b>Papanicolau</b> <b>smear,</b> pelvic examination, and transvaginal ultrasonography. They were asked to bring their diary of menstrual bleeding. They were asked about side effects and their satisfaction with the therapy. Peripheral blood was drawn for blood count and serum chemistries. Hysteroscopic-directed biopsies were repeated after 3 months of therapy in women with endometrial hyperplasia. The severity of blood loss was significantly reduced in all women after 3 months of treatment. All women with endometrial hyperplasia had regression of hyperplastic endometrium.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and types in the oral and cervix mucosa of treatment-naïve HIV- 1 -positive women with CD 4 counts less than 300 cells per ml with no HPV-associated oral lesions. METHODS: Oral epithelium was harvested from the buccal mucosa and lateral borders of the tongue and cervical samples were collected from the endocervical area of 30 women, 22 – 64 years old. Cytobrush Plus cell collectors were used for sampling both anatomical areas. Genital pathology, obstetric and gynaecological history, co-morbid disease, hormone therapy, sexual behavior and smoking history were assessed via physical examination and clinical interviews. Special investigations included cervical Papanicolau smears, CD 4 counts and HIV- 1 viral loads. The linear array HPV {{test was used to}} determine HPV genotypes present in the specimens. RESULTS: Oral HPV were identified in 20 % (n = 6) of the patients, of which two had infection with two HPV types. Genital HPV was found in 96. 7 % (n = 29) of the women, of which only 14 had cytological abnormalities on <b>Papanicolau</b> <b>smear.</b> Infection with multiple HPV types were present in 93. 1 % (n = 27) of the patients, with an average of four HPV types per individual. CONCLUSIONS: South African HIV-positive women with CD 4 counts less than 300 cells per ml have a significant risk of cervical HPV strains and multiple strain infection of the cervix. The prevalence of HPV in normal oral mucosa was low but high-risk types were present. Limited correlation between oral HPV types and those identified in the cervical mucosa was found.

40|$|Infection, {{coinfection}} and type-specific {{human papillomavirus}} (HPV) distribution was evaluated in {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) -positive women from paired cervical and urine samples. Paired cervical and urine samples (n = 204) were taken from HIV-positive women for identifying HPV-DNA presence by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with three generic primer sets (GP 5 +/ 6 +, MY 09 / 11 and pU 1 M/ 2 R). HPV-positive samples were typed for six high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) (HPV- 16, - 18, - 31, - 33, - 45 and - 58) and two low-risk (LR-HPV) (HPV- 6 / 11) types. Agreement between paired sample results and diagnostic performance was evaluated. HPV infection prevalence was 70. 6 % in cervical and 63. 2 % in urine samples. HPV- 16 was the most prevalent HPV type in both types of sample (66. 7 % in cervical samples and 62. 0 % in urine) followed by HPV- 31 (47. 2 %) in cervical samples and HPV- 58 (35. 7 %) in urine samples. There was 55. 4 % coinfection (infection {{by more than one}} type of HPV) in cervical samples and 40. 2 % in urine samples. Abnormal <b>Papanicolau</b> <b>smears</b> were observed in 25. 3 % of the women, presenting significant association with HPV-DNA being identified in urine samples. There was poor agreement of cervical and urine sample results in generic and type-specific detection of HPV. Urine samples provided the best diagnosis when taking cytological findings as reference. In conclusion including urine samples could be a good strategy for ensuring adherence to screening programs aimed at reducing the impact of cervical cancer, since this sample is easy to obtain and showed good diagnostic performance.

Methods: Cross-sectional study conducted from March to December 2015, including HIV-infected women attending referral centers in nine states of Brazil, aged 18 – 49 years, nonpregnant. An interview was conducted including socio-demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics. After the interview, gynecological examination was conducted to collect cervical cytology and vaginal secretion to C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae tests through molecular biology. Results: A total of 802 (89. 1 %) women participated. The prevalence of CT was 2. 1 % (17 / 802) and CG was 0. 9 % (7 / 802). The prevalence of a positive test for both CT and/or GC was 2. 7 %. The factors associated with positive CT/GC test in the multivariate logistic regression analysis were abnormal <b>Papanicolau</b> <b>smear</b> (OR 4. 1; 95 % CI: 1. 54 – 11. 09) and the presence of abnormal cervical discharge (OR 2. 6; 95 % CI: 1. 02 – 6. 71).

Methods: We screened 216 HIV- positive women with <b>Papanicolau</b> <b>smear</b> cytology and HPV testing. HPV DNA was detected by using consensus primers followed by sequencing. Results: Of the 216 HIV-positive women screened, 58 (26. 85 %) were HPV-positive; 56 (25. 9 %) were of high-risk (HR) HPV type. The most prevalent HPV type was HPV- 16 (7. 9 %); non 16 and 18 HPV types were present in 17. 6 per cent patients. Age ≤ 35 yr [(OR), 2. 56 (1. 26 - 5. 19) ], illiteracy [OR, 2. 30 (1. 19 - 4. 46) ], rural residence [OR, 3. 99 (1. 27 - 12. 56) ] and CD 4 ≤ 350 /µl [OR, 2. 46 (1. 26 - 4. 83) ] were associated with increased risk of acquisition of HPV. One hundred thirty nine (74. 33 %) patients had normal/ negative for intraepithelial lesions (NILM) cytology, three (1. 60 %) had atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), 32 (17. 11 %) had low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 10 (5. 35 %) had high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and three (1. 60 %) had carcinoma cervix.

40|$|Background: Cervical {{cancer is}} an {{important}} public health problem among adult women in many developing countries. Cervical cytology became the standard screening test for cervical cancer and premalignant cervical lesions {{with the introduction of}} the <b>Papanicolau</b> (Pap) <b>smear.</b> The most widely used system for describing PAP smear result is the Bethesda System 2001. Material and Methods: This study was aimed at evaluating the entire spectrum of types and frequencies of cervical cytological abnormalities i. e. infective, pre-cancerous and cancerous, in women who underwent routine cytological cervical screening at our hospital which caters largely to women of low socio-economic status. Results: A total of 610 cases of cervical pap smears were received in our cytology laboratory during this two year period, 348 (57 %) abnormal Pap smears, and 238 (39 %) cases which were normal. Out of the 348 cases, 306 (50. 2 %) cases were reported to have inflammatory/reactive/reparative changes whereas epithelial cell abnormality was reported in 42 cases. Discussion: Cervical smear cytology also {{plays an important role in}} the diagnosis of cervical infections which are common in women of the reproductive age group.

Methods. Retrospective study. Immunologic, gynaecologic and virologic data were extracted either from patients charts or from laboratory testing. Results. At first visit Pap smears resulted normal in 43. 7 % of the women, 8. 4 % of the patients had reactive and reparative changes, 2. 8 % atypical cells of undetermined significance, 33. 8 % low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and 11. 3 % high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Patients with a normal PAP smear had higher CD 4 cell count (318 ± 191 cells/µL) compared to patients with squamous intraepithelial lesions (297 ± 116 cells/µL) but the difference was not statistically significant (Mann-Whitney test). The distribution of cervical dysplasia was found to be similar regardless of antiretroviral therapy (? 2 test). The sensitivity and specificity of Pap tests for detecting CIN were 94 and 80 %. Twenty-two per cent of surgically treated women had persistent or recurrent disease. Conclusions. Lower CD 4 + cell counts are not predictive of the presence of cervical dysplasia.

40|$|Community Health Centers (CHCs) are {{the nation}} 2 ̆ 7 s primary care {{safety net for}} {{vulnerable}} populations, including racial/ethnic minorities, immigrants, migrant workers, {{and those who are}} uninsured. Women from such population sub-groups contribute disproportionately to cervical cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality due, in large part, to the underutilization of <b>Papanicolau</b> (Pap) <b>smear</b> screening. Routine Pap smear screening can detect the onset and prevent progression of cervical malignancies. This article reports findings of a cross-sectional study to investigate the association between Pap smear compliance and patient race/ethnicity, insurance, and age for more than 60, 000 women seen in a network of CHCs in Florida. Results of this study indicated a strong association between race/ ethnicity and Pap smear screening in CHCs. Among women aged 21 - 45 years, Hispanics were twice as likely to receive Pap smear screening, while Blacks were 1. 45 times more likely to receive Pap smear screening, when compared to White women. These results were unexpected because most studies have shown that Hispanic women are less likely to receive screening than their Black and White counterparts.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{alterations in}} the cytokine profile and microbial ecosystem of the vagina {{in association with}} cervical dysplasia. METHODS: Demographics, lifestyle variables and <b>Papanicolau</b> (Pap) <b>smear</b> results of subjects presenting to the same site for gynecologic complaints, obstetric visits or colposcopy were prospectively recorded. Vaginal smear for Gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic culture, pH, and wet mount and KOH examination for Trichomonas vaginalis, Gardnerella vaginalis and yeast organisms were performed. Vaginal lavage specimens were centrifuged, and the pellets and supernatants were assayed for human papillomavirus (HPV) by polymerase chain reaction and for cytokines interleukin (IL) - 1 beta IL- 6, IL- 10 and IL- 12 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) respectively. Subjects with abnormal Pap smears underwent colposcopy and biopsy as indicated. RESULTS: Of 51 patients, 32 were referred for colposcopy, 12 presented with gynecologic needs, and seven presented for obstetric visits. Median age was 24 years. Demographics {{did not differ significantly}} between the dysplasia and control groups except for a trend towards more sexual partners in the dysplasia group. Biopsies were performed in 81 % (26 / 32) of patients presenting for colposcopy and 17 revealed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, IL- 10, and IL- 12 levels were elevated in 63 % (20 / 32), 38 % (15 / 39), 4 % (2 / 49), and 0 % of samples respectively. Elevated vaginal lavage IL- 1 beta was associated with a 6. 1 odds ratio (95 % confidence interval 1. 06 - 35) of cervical dysplasia. Alterations in other variables studied were not associated with cervical dysplasia.

Methods: Between June and November 2009, 500 HIV-positive women were enrolled at an HIV treatment clinic in Nairobi, Kenya, and underwent <b>Papanicolau</b> (Pap) <b>smear,</b> visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), human papillomavirus (HPV) and colposcopydirected biopsy (gold standard). Positive Pap smear (ASCUS, LSIL, HSIL), VIA, HPV and their combinations were compared with CIN 2 / 3 +. Sensitivity, specificity and AUC (sensitivity and 1 -specificity) were compared using pairwise tests and multivariate logistic regression models that included age, CD 4 + cell count and ART duration. Results:Of 500 enrolled, 498 samples were collected. On histology, there were 172 (35 %) normal, 186 (37 %) CIN 1, 66 (13 %) CIN 2, 47 (9 %) CIN 3 and 27 (5 %) indeterminate. Pap (ASCUS+) was the most sensitive screening method (92. 7 %), combination of both Pap (HSIL+) and VIA positive was the most specific (99. 1 %) and Pap (HSIL+) had the highest AUC (0. 85). In multivariate analyses, CD 4 + cell count of 350 cells/ml or less was associated with decreased HPV specificity (P= 0. 002); ART duration of less than 2 years was associated with decreased HPV (P= 0. 01) and VIA (P= 0. 03) specificity; and age less than 40 years was associated with increased VIA sensitivity (P Conclusion: Pap smear is a robust test among HIV-positive women regardless of immune status or ART duration.

METHOD: This study is a definitional, society based sectional study performed among the women between the ages of 35 - 40 in the district of Kisecik in Hatay. 187 women between the ages of 35 - 40 were enrolled to the study; 10 out of 187 women who were single were not included to the study. The study was completed after enrolling 150 women out of 177. Cervical smear samples were taken from the participants; and these samples were evaluated in a pathology laboratory according to the Bethesda 2001 scale. RESULTS: The avarage age of the participants was 37. 55 &# 177; 1. 77. After the evaluation of the cervical smears in the pathology laboratory, the results were normal for 73 participants (% 48. 7). 36 participants (% 24. 0) had non specific inflamation, 20 participants (% 13. 3) had bacterial vaginosis, 19 participants (% 12. 7) had seconder reactive changes to the inflamation and 2 participants (% 1. 3) was reported to be ASC-US. CONCLUSION: By the help of cheap and easily applied Pap smear test, society based scanning programmes can be performed frequently and thus; servical lesions may be detected in early phases. Furthermore through education, the level of information about cervical cancer should be raised and consciousness should be created. [TAF Prev Med Bull 2010; 9 (5. 000) : 471 - 474...|$|R
40|$|Background: Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{is known}} {{to be involved in the}} carcinogenesis of squamous cells in uterine cervix cancer, mostly by binding and inactivating the p 53 and pRb tumor suppressor genes. Lately, evidence has emerged suggesting that HPV oncoproteins may interact with proteins involved in cellular apoptosis as well. Aim: This study aimed to investigate the expression of proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak in women with low-risk and high-risk HPV types as opposed to HPV-negative women, and in women with normal pap smear compared to women with abnormal <b>Papanicolau</b> test (Pap) <b>smear.</b> Materials and Methods: A total of 120 liquid-based cervical samples were subtyped for HPV types with microarray hybridization and then stained and evaluated immunocytochemically for Bax and Bak expression. Statistical analysis was performed on the Bax and Bak scores (percentage of positive cells × staining intensity), the overall percentage of positive cells, and the most prevalent staining intensity group found in each sample. Results: A weak association between negative Bax staining and cytologically normal Pap smears was discovered, whereas cytologically abnormal samples tended to stain weakly or moderately positive. No other statistically significant difference was found in the other analyzed parameters. Conclusion: Cytologically normal pap smears seem to have a slight tendency to stain negative for Bax as opposed to cytologically abnormal pap smears. Although the association is weak, it is an indication that there might be a connection between the expression of Bax and the development of cervical intraepithelial dysplasia, which warrants further investigation in larger-scale studies...|$|R
