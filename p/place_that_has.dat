25|$|By 1980, a {{restoration}} programme {{was put in}} <b>place</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> now been running for over 20 years. This programme has aimed to reconnect the marshes by returning tidal flow along with the ecological functions and characteristics of the marshes back to their original state. In the case of Barn Island, declines in the invasive species have initiated, re-establishing the tidal-marsh vegetation along with animal species such as fish and insects. This example highlights that considerable time and effort is needed to effectively restore salt marsh systems. Times in marsh recovery can depend on the development stage of the marsh; type and extent of the disturbance; geographical location; and the environmental and physiological stress factors to the marsh-associated flora and fauna.|$|E

However two Merian prints show that the town was fully walled with gate towers on the E and W. On the flatter land to the N the wall was angled and there was a prominent round tower. On the craggy promontory to the S there was another gate tower with a road leading to the Drau bridge.
