I carried out evaluation of my own personal historic lesson plans to help understand the planning of tasks and then planned two schemes of work. These schemes of work were planned and developed with the use of literature, students' feedback and my own personal reflection. Learning diaries were used in the second feedback to give students more ownership of their learning and inform me for future planning. Findings indicated that knowledge is an important factor when <b>planning</b> <b>lessons</b> and developing task design. Knowledge should be at the forefront of planning. Knowledge has been discussed in detail (Firth, 2015 b, Lambert, 2011 & DfE, 2013).

Moreover, considering the finding of the study there was an attempt to seek the experts’ views on how to perform <b>lesson</b> <b>plan</b> practically through forming a focus group. Methods: This is a descriptive study indicating the attitudes of 152 academic staff about <b>lesson</b> <b>plan.</b> The data were collected using a questionnaire. The findings of the first stage was followed by forming a focus group in the second stage. Ten authorities and experts in the field were selected. They were interviewed on how to perform <b>lesson</b> <b>plans</b> in Shiraz university of Medical Sciences in three sessions. It was concluded that the main barrier for designing and performing the <b>lesson</b> <b>plan</b> is the academic staff’s lack of awareness about its advantages. Results: Of the population under the study, 30 % were females and 70 % males. The majority of the academic staff (126 individuals, 85. 1 %) believes that they need a <b>lesson</b> <b>plan</b> in their field and that the implementation of <b>lesson</b> <b>plan</b> contributes to the improvement of education. 70. 9 % (1. 5) of them believe that <b>lesson</b> <b>plan</b> does not limit the educational process.
