500|$|Old Louisville is not {{actually}} the oldest part of Louisville. In fact, large-scale development south of Broadway {{did not begin}} until the 1870s, nearly a century after what is now Downtown Louisville was first settled. The area was initially part of three different military land grants issued in 1773, and throughout the early and mid-19th century the land passed through the hands of several speculators, meanwhile {{much of it was}} used as farmland. Some of the land south of Broadway was still in its natural state during this time, such as the [...] tract between Broadway and Breckenridge, known as Jacob's Woods, a popular <b>picnic</b> <b>ground</b> as late as 1845. A major attraction was Oakland Race Track, near today's Seventh and Ormsby, built in 1839 and an early forerunner to Churchill Downs.|$|E

2500|$|By the 1930s, {{there were}} several {{concessions}} operated by private firms within the area that would become the park, some {{going back to the}} late 19th century. These early private facilities at Skyland Resort, Panorama Resort, and Swift Run Gap were operated only for whites. By 1937, the Park Service accepted a bid from Virginia Sky-Line Company to take over the existing facilities and add new lodges, cabins, and other amenities, including Big Meadows Lodge. Under their plan, all the sites in the parks, save one, were for [...] "whites only". Their plan included a separate facility for African Americans at Lewis Mountain—a <b>picnic</b> <b>ground,</b> a smaller lodge, cabins and a campground. The site opened in 1939, and it was substantially inferior to the other park facilities. By then, however, the Interior Department was increasingly anxious to eliminate segregation from all parks. Pinnacles <b>picnic</b> <b>ground</b> was selected to be the initial integrated site in the Shenandoah, but Virginia Sky-Line Company continued to balk, and distributed maps showing Lewis Mountain as the only site for African Americans. During World War II, concessions closed and park usage plunged. But once the War ended, in December 1945, the NPS mandated that all concessions in all national parks were to be desegregated. In October 1947 the dining rooms of Lewis Mountain and Panorama were integrated and by early 1950, the mandate was fully accomplished.|$|E
2500|$|Beaver Creek Valley was {{proposed}} {{as a state}} park in the 1930s, and acquisition of the privately owned lots began in 1936. [...] The park was authorized by the Minnesota Legislature the following year. [...] A small Works Progress Administration crew arrived in 1938 and built the entrance road, flood control structures, <b>picnic</b> <b>ground,</b> and trails. [...] The campground {{was developed in the}} late 1940s. [...] The boundaries of the park were extended in the late 1960s out of concern that landowners along the blufftops might cut the timber, causing erosion. [...] However few owners were willing to sell these lots, as most of it was good farmland which, moreover, wouldn't be easily accessible to parkgoers on the valley floor. [...] In the face of anti-expansion sentiment, the 1978 state legislature redrew the statutory boundaries of the park to include only state-owned land. [...] A provision remains by which additional land could be acquired from willing sellers without legislative action. [...] The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has been interested in adding the Schech Mill to the park, but the family that has owned it since 1887 has preferred to operate the mill privately as a tourist attraction.|$|E
2500|$|Chief J.E. Babatola also {{indicated}} {{that most of the}} organizations that made demands for the creation of an Ekiti State wanted Ado-Ekiti as its capital because Ado-Ekiti is uniquely a natural setting capable of resultant development of its landscape and facilities in a way to assist the finance of the administration of a new State. Part of the summary of the presentation to Mbanefo’s Panel on State Creation for the choice of Ado-Ekiti as the State Capital in Chief Babatola’s submission was his presentation of the Ekiti Map where he referred to the population sizes of Ekitis and showed that the percentages yielded by the population of Ekiti North (headquarters at Ikole), Ijero (headquarters at Ijero) and Ero (headquarters at Ido Ekiti) are respectively 13.03, 0.93, and 15.35, while that of Ado stood at 28.43% of their entire population. He noted that in using a map of Ekiti produced before Akure opted out of the Ekiti confederacy in 1946, the centre of balance geometrically in Ekitiland between 1913 and 1946 was Itaipe area (the <b>picnic</b> <b>ground</b> at Ado-Ekiti). He highlighted the efforts of Ado-Ekiti people to make the Ekiti Division of Ondo Province achieve development in terms of road transportation, creation of land bank for business and official use through existence of road infrastructures to link the town with the other Ekiti administrative divisions, extensive Government Reservation Areas to house government officials (i.e. District Officers, judges and magistrates), the Ewi-in-Council 1975 augmentation of Government efforts by creation of land bank for development purposes, construction of several buildings by the Federal and State Governments for the official use of the administrative, judiciary, police and prison departments, existing communication facilities and adequate provision for effective administration of justice and security of lives in Ekitiland which is at its best in Ado-Ekiti. He noted that since Ekitis naturally come to Ado-Ekiti regularly and settle there in large numbers to do business and contribute enormously to the increased prosperity of Ekiti people, Ado-Ekiti is a befitting place to site the capital. He concluded that ‘…Ado-Ekiti is already a fortunate asset with no liability attached in setting up the apparatus for a state capital…” ...|$|E

6000|$|Olive Street, now {{paved with}} hot granite and {{disfigured}} by trolley wires, was {{a country road}} then.

60|$|They {{walked out}} beyond the {{outskirts}} of the town, where there was a grove or <b>picnic</b> <b>ground</b> which was also used as a park by some of the inhabitants.

It had always been a favorite <b>picnic</b> <b>ground,</b> but the season just past had known few picnics, and it was those of former years that had left their traces in rusty sardine-cans and broken glass and crockery on the border of the clearing, which was now almost covered with white moss. Jeff thought of the day when he lurked in the hollow below with Fox, while Westover remained talking with Whitwell. He thought of the picnic that Mrs. Marven had embittered for him, and he thought of the last time that he had been there with Westover, when they talked of the Vostrands.|$|E
