40|$|In 1946, Metz {{described}} what {{was probably the}} first practical impedance bridge for measurement of the acoustic reflex. Over the next four decades, diagnostic use of the acoustic reflex progressed in parallel with instrumentation refinements. Today, acoustic reflex threshold and decay testing are a routine com-ponent of the diagnostic audiology test battery. Recent advances in the measurement of suprathreshold latency and amplitude have further enhanced the diagnostic value of acoustic reflex measurement. In 1975, Sanders (1) summarized his experience with immittance audiometry by writing that “it is rapidly being {{recognized as one of}} the most significant contributions since the development of the <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>audiometer</b> ” (p. 122). One wonders if Otto Metz ever envisioned what was to become of his pioneering work in the clinical measure-ment of middle ear impedance. The story of modern clinical immittance audiometry began in Copenhagen in 1946 with Metz’s now classic monograph (2) on the use of impedance measurement in otological diagnosis. It progressed over the next four decades as the result of a fascinating blend of technological advancement and clin-ical intuition and implementation. It continues today with immittance audiometry enjoying the status of an integral and routine aspect of diagnostic audiology...|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{is a need}} {{to develop}} {{affordable}} but effective audiometric screening equipment, particularly for use in low-income countries. With advances in computer technology, low-cost computer-based audiometer software has been developed. However, the efficacy of computer-based audiometers in hearing screening and diagnostic assessment requires investigation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the accuracy of a low-cost, computer-based audiometric system in a school-based hearing screening programme. Methods: Eighty children were screened using the computer-based audiometer and with a conventional pure tone screening audiometer. Overall refer rates, as well as frequency and age effects on the accuracy of the computer-based audiometer, were considered. Results: There was a significant relationship between the low-cost, computer-based audiometer and a conventional <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>audiometer</b> when a 40 dBHL refer criterion was used in school hearing screening and when test results at 500 Hz were excluded from analysis. However, background noise effects and software limitations in the computer-based system had major adverse effects on screening performance. Conclusions: The study results and preliminary practical experience with the system suggest that, with further software and hardware improvements, a low-cost, computer-based system may well be feasible for routine school screening in developing countries. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|This {{test was}} held in a sound-poof room, and {{the sources of the}} sound were all of <b>pure</b> <b>tone.</b> The <b>audiometer</b> {{receivers}} were connected to a double audiometer. The examinee had an apparent source of sound and the intensity difference and the time difference varied between both ears. The angular displacement of the apparent source was measured in contrast to the <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> from a loud speaker connected to a beat frequency oscillator and was audible through spaces between the receivers and the ears. It was ascertained that the value of displacement was proportional to the logarithm of the ratio of intensities. (Stewsat's logarithmic law) Stewart's constant is different according to individuals. The constant does not vary with the increasing frequency. The value of the angular displacement was proportional to the difference of the lengths of two sound-ways. The relation of the angular displacement (θ) with the time difference (T) and intensity difference (I) were as follows; θ=f(1) (I) +f(2) (T) Intensity difference must be of extensively great quantity to remove the apparent source.

40|$|Objective: Aim of {{this study}} was to show the effects of {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (RA) on auditory system using <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>audiometer</b> and tympanometric assessments and to compare these values with healthy controls. Methods: This study included 107 subjects: 57 RA pa­tients who were being followed at our clinic with a RA diagnosis and 50 healthy controls who had similar age and gender properties. Besides clinical and laboratory findings audiometric, and tympanometric tests and sta­pes reflex measurements were compared for all patients. Results: Results {{of this study}} showed statistically signifi­cant differences in air conduction thresholds at 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 kHz frequencies between RA patients and con­trols. In RA patients, bone conduction was affected only at 4 kHz and more in left ear. Additionally, air-bone conduc­tion differences were significant except at 2 kHz. Although air-bone conduction difference was higher in the study group than the control group, this was not statistically sig­nificant. Similarly no significant difference was detected in stapes reflex and tympanometric measurements between RA patients and healthy controls statistically. Conclusion: This study showed that conduction type hearing loss is seen more frequently in RA patients and bone conduction is affected at high frequencies in particu­lar. Moreover, No significant differences were seen in sta­pes reflex, compliance and pressure measures between groups. J Clin Exp Invest 2016; 7 (1) : 63 - 6...|$|E
40|$|Background: Loss {{of hearing}} is a {{national}} health problem with significant social and psychosocial implications. Worldwide there are about 65 - 330 million people affected with hearing impairment, of which 60 % suffers from significant hearing loss. Role of tympanic membrane and ossicular chain in the physiology of hearing is well documented. The emergence of {{the role played by}} mastoid air space volume in sound transmission is being critically evaluated these days. The present study is designed to analyze the effect of mastoid air space volume in tympanic membrane perforation with conductive hearing loss. Methods: 32 subjects both male and female with medium sized tympanic membrane perforation were included in the study. They were grouped into two (those with sclerotic and cellular mastoid). Hearing threshold assessed using <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>audiometer.</b> Mastoid air space volume evaluated using digital X-ray mastoid schuller's view. Tympanic membrane perforation size assessed using otoscope. Results: The hearing loss in first group having cellular mastoid and second group with sclerotic mastoid were 22. 82 +/- 6. 28 and 27. 82 +/- 5. 66 respectively. Their p value was 0. 026 which was statistically significant. Conclusions: Mastoid air space volume is inversely proportional to conductive hearing loss. Therefore mastoid air space volume also {{plays a key role in}} the sound transmission. The awareness of the pneumatisation status of the mastoid helps clinicians to choose appropriate line of management. [Int J Res Med Sci 2016; 4 (7. 000) : 2611 - 2614...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} aging on verbal {{short-term}} memory (STM) {{are still a}} matter of debate (e. g., Nilsson et al., 2003). Recent models of STM distinguish processes involved in the retention of item information (i. e., the identity of words) and order information (i. e., the order of presentation of items) (see Majerus, 2008, for a review). Finally, these models also incorporate relationships between STM and word production capacities, which are often impaired in aging (Burke et al., 1991). The aims of this study are (1) to explore the effects of aging on both item and order STM capacities, (2) to explore the effects of aging on naming capacities and (3) to explore the relationships between STM and naming in aging. Three groups of participants participated in the present study: (1) 56 - 64 years old (N= 26) – (2) 65 - 74 years old (N= 23) – (3) 75 - 84 years old (N= 22). The participants' hearing thresholds were analyzed with a <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>audiometer.</b> The participants were asked to perform STM tasks and a picture naming task. The results confirm the presence of naming difficulties in participants above 65 years of age, as previously shown by Verhaegen and Poncelet (in press). By contrast, in STM, the differences become non significant when the hearing status is controlled for. However, the items are presented auditorily in all STM tasks. Therefore, in order to confirm the absence of age-related differences in STM, it would be of interest to assess the participants with visual STM tasks. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background It is {{recognized}} {{that the size of}} tympanic membrane(TM) perforation is proportional to the magnitude of hearing loss, however, there is no clear consensus on the effect of the location (site) of the perforation on the hearing loss. Hence the study is set to investigate the relationship between the location of perforation on TM and hearing loss. Methods A cross-sectional prospective study of consecutive adult patients with perforated TM conducted in the ENT clinic of University College Hospital Ibadan between January 1 st 2005 and July 31 st 2006. Instruments used for data collection/processing include questionnaires, video and micro-otoscopy, <b>Pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>audiometer,</b> image J and SPSS packages. Results Sixty-two patients (22 -males, 40 -females), aged 16 – 75 years (mean = 35. 4 +/- 4) with 77 perforated ear drums were studied and 15 (24. 2 %) had bilateral TM perforations, 21 (33. 9 %) right unilateral and 26 (41. 9 %) left unilateral. The locations of the TM perforations were 60 (77. 9 %) central, 6 (9. 6 %) antero-inferior, 4 (5. 2 %) postero-inferior, 4 (5. 2 %) antero-superior and 3 (3. 9 %) postero-superior respectively with sizes ranging from 1. 51 %– 89. 05 %, and corresponding hearing levels 30 dB – 80 dB (59 % conductive and 41 % mixed). Fifty-nine percent had pure conductive hearing loss and the rest mixed. Hearing losses (dBHL) increased with the size of perforations (P = 0. 01, r = 0. 05). Correlation of location of perforations with magnitude of hearing loss in acute TM perorations was (P = 0. 244, r = 0. 273) and for chronic perforations (p = 0. 047 & r = 0. 31).

40|$|Objective: The {{correlation}} between tympanic membrane perforations and hearing loss was studied. Study Design: Cross sectional prospective study design. Setting: E. N. T OPD, at a tertiary referral center. Materials and Methods: 100 perforated ears in patients of CSOM safe {{were selected from}} May 2011 to September 2013. Instruments used for data collection/processing included questionnaires, oto-endoscopy and micro-otoscopy, <b>Pure</b> <b>tone</b> <b>audiometer</b> and image J software. Results: Sixty-three patients (27 -males, 36 -females), aged 10 - 56 years (mean age 23. 2 years ± 11. 8 years) with 100 perforated eardrums were studied. 37 (58. 7 %) had bilateral TM perforations, 7 (11. 1 %) right unilateral and 19 (30. 2 %) left unilateral. The various sizes of perforation and their hearing loss were as follows: Group I (0 - 8 mm 2), n= 18, with mean hearing loss 29. 41 ± 4. 39. Group II (8. 1 - 30 mm 2), n= 39, with mean hearing loss 34. 69 ± 4. 96. Group III (> 30. 1 mm 2), n = 43, with mean hearing loss= 38. 79 ± 3. 44. Difference was significant, P value 0. 000. The various sites of perforations were Central (69 ears. Mean hearing loss 35. 64 dB ± 5. 31), Posterior (16 ears, mean hearing loss 39. 99 dB ± 2. 79) and Anterior (15 ears, mean hearing loss 30. 1 dB ± 2. 98). Difference was significant, P value 0. 000. Lower frequencies were affected more than higher frequencies. Inverted ′V′ pattern of audiograms was observed at 2000 Hz.

40|$|Quality {{and rate}} of {{preserved}} hearing are crucial to make hearing preservation surgery a viable treatment. A long-term experience with hearing preservation surgery, with tumour size and hearing as admission criteria, was evaluated to assess which size and hearing allowed {{a high rate of}} success. The hearing outcome in relation to size of tumour and pre-operative hearing was retrospectively reviewed in a consecutive series of 115 cases of sporadic acoustic neuroma which were operated on with hearing preservation surgery. Inclusion criteria were hearing with ≤ 30 dB <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> average and ≥ 70 % Speech Discrimination Score. The size was ≤ 15 mm in the first series of 51 cases, and ≤ 10 mm in the second series of 64 cases. Pre-operative and post-operative <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> average were measured at 0. 5 to 4. 0 KHz, and speech discrimination score at ≤ 40 dB above perception. Post-operative hearing within 30 dB <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> average and 70 % speech discrimination score was considered socially useful hearing and successful outcome. The change to 40 dB <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> average and 60 % speech discrimination score from a pre-operative 30 <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> average/ 70 % speech discrimination score was considered an acceptable outcome. Patients with a tumour of ≤ 10 mm size in the cerebello-pontine-angle and hearing within 20 dB <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> average/ 80 % speech discrimination score had a success rate of 76 %. Patients with hearing between the 20 dB <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> average/ 80 % speech discrimination score and 30 dB <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> average/ 70 % speech discrimination score had a success rate of 41 %, which increased to 53 % if the limit to success was set at 40 dB <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> average/ 60 % speech discrimination score. Patients with a tumour larger than 10 mm or hearing worse than 30 dB <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> average/ 70 % speech discrimination score had a poor preservation rate.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Recent {{research}} suggests tinnitus is a phantom phenomenon based on hyperactivity of the auditory system, {{which can be}} visualized by functional neuroimaging, and transiently modulated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We present {{the results of the}} first implanted electrodes on the primary and secondary auditory cortex after a successful TMS suppression. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve patients underwent an auditory cortex implantation, 10 for unilateral and 2 for bilateral tinnitus, based on > 50 % suppression applying TMS. Results were analyzed for <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> tinnitus and white noise tinnitus. RESULTS: TMS results in 77 % <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> tinnitus and 67 % white noise reduction. Electrical stimulation via an implanted electrode results in a mean of 97 % <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> tinnitus and 24 % white noise suppression. Mean Visual Analogue Scale score decreases from 9. 5 to 1. 5 for <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> and from 8. 8 to 6. 8 for white noise postoperatively. DISCUSSION: <b>Pure</b> <b>tone</b> tinnitus might be the conscious percept of focal neuronal hyperactivity of the auditory cortex. Once visualized, this hyperactivity can be modulated by neurostimulation. CONCLUSION: The preliminary results of the first implantations suggest that patients with unilateral <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> tinnitus are good surgical candidates for electrode implantation and permanent electrical stimulation of the auditory cortex, provided that the tinnitus is of recent origin and can be suppressed by TMS. status: publishe...|$|R

This study aimed {{to compare the}} validity and screening rates of <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> audiometry with impedance screening in these children. METHODS: Two stage <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> audiometry and impedance methods of screening were compared in 610 school entry children from 19 infant schools in north east England. Both procedures were completed by school nurses. The results of screening were validated against subsequent clinical assessment, including otological examination and actions taken by an independent assessor. RESULTS: Both methods produced broadly similar validation indices after two stages of screening: sensitivity was 74. 4 % for both methods; specificity was 92. 1 % and 90. 0 %; and predicted values of a positive test 43. 2 % and 37. 6 % respectively for <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> audiometry and impedance methods.

40|$|Doppler shift {{compensation}} behaviour in horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus rouxi, {{was used}} to test the interference of <b>pure</b> <b>tones</b> and narrow band noise with compensation performance. The distortions in Doppler shift compensation to sinusoidally frequency shifted echoes (modulation frequency: 0. 1 Hz, maximum frequency shift: 3 kHz) consisted of a reduced compensation amplitude and/or a shift of the emitted frequency to lower frequencies (Fig. 1). <b>Pure</b> <b>tones</b> at frequencies between 200 and 900 Hz above the bat's resting frequency (RF) disturbed the Doppler shift compensation, with a maximum of intererence between 400 and 550 Hz (Fig. 2). Minimum duration of <b>pure</b> <b>tones</b> for interference was 20 ms and durations above 40 ms were most effective (Fig. 3). Interfering <b>pure</b> <b>tones</b> arriving later than about 10 ms after the onset of the echolocation call showed markedly reduced interference (Fig. 4). Doppler shift compensation was affected by <b>pure</b> <b>tones</b> at the optimum interfering frequency with sound pressure levels down to – 48 dB rel the intensity level of the emitted call (Figs. 5, 6). Narrow bandwidth noise (bandwidth from ± 100 Hz to ± 800 Hz) disturbed Doppler shift compensation at carrier frequencies between – 250 Hz below and 800 Hz above RF with a maximum of interference between 250 and 500 Hz above resting frequency (Fig. 7).

The distractor stream could be either spatiotemporally congruent or incongruent with respect to the target stream on each trial. The results showed that sound complexity modulated performance, decreasing the accuracy of tactile direction judgements when presented simultaneously with noise distractors, while facilitating judgements of the direction of the noise bursts (as compared to <b>pure</b> <b>tones).</b> Although auditory direction judgements were overall more accurate for noise (than for <b>pure</b> <b>tone)</b> targets, the complexity of the sound failed to modulate the tactile capture of auditory targets. These results provide the first demonstration of enhanced audiotactile interactions involving complex (vs. <b>pure</b> <b>tone)</b> auditory stimuli in the peripersonal space around the hands (previously these effects have only been reported in the space around the head) ...|$|R
40|$|Vocalizations Rhacophorus edentulus Mueller, 1894 {{have never}} been {{described}} before. The advertisement calls of four individual males of R. edentulus which originated from Mekongga Mountains, Southeast Sulawesi were recorded in December 7 - 8, 2010 at air temperatures of 20. 5 Â°C. Â Location of sound recording for the four individual males were performed at two different places, call of one individual was recorded when it was calling {{in a plastic bag}} in the base camp, while calls of the other three individuals were recorded in their habitat in the forest. Adobe Audition 3. 0 software was used to visualize sound waves. Â Calls of R. edentulus have two types, i. e. pulses and <b>pure</b> <b>tone.</b> Â Sound wave of pulses has two types, namely pulse type 1 and pulse type 2; whereas sound wave of <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> also has two types, namely <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> type 1 and <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> type 2. Â Based on the dominant frequency and the fundamental frequency of <b>pure</b> <b>tones</b> waves and pulse waves, the natural noise in the forest habitats affects the dynamics of the frequency of calls that were released by males R. edentulus; frequency sound with low noise is more dynamic than the frequency of the sound with high noise level. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: (1) To {{establish}} {{test performance}} measures for Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission testing of 6 -year-old {{children in a}} school setting; (2) To investigate whether Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission testing provides a more accurate and effective alternative to a <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> screening plus tympanometry protocol. Methods: <b>Pure</b> <b>tone</b> screening, tympanometry and transient evoked otoacoustic emission {{data were collected from}} 940 subjects (1880 ears), {{with a mean age of}} 6. 2 years. Subjects were tested in non-sound-treated rooms within 22 schools. Receiver operating characteristics curves along with specificity, sensitivity, accuracy and efficiency values were determined for a variety of transient evoked otoacoustic emission/pure tone screening/tympanometry comparisons. Results: The Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission failure rate for the group was 20. 3 %. The failure rate for <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> screening was found to be 8. 9 %, whilst 18. 6 % of subjects failed a protocol consisting of combined <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> screening and tympanometry results. In essence, findings from the comparison of overall Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission pass/fail with overall <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> screening pass/fail suggested that use of a modified Rhode Island Hearing Assessment Project criterion would result in a very high probability that a child with a pass result has normal hearing (true negative). However, the hit rate was only moderate. Selection of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) criterion set at ≥ 1 dB appeared to provide the best test performance measures for the range of SNR values investigated. Test performance measures generally declined when tympanometry results were included, with the exception of lower false alarm rates and higher positive predictive values. The exclusion of low frequency data from the Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission SNR versus <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> screening analysis resulted in improved performance measures. Conclusions: The present study poses several implications for the clinical implementation of Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission screening for entry level school children. Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission pass/fail criteria will require revision. The findings of the current investigation offer support to the possible replacement of <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> screening with Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission testing for 6 -year-old children. However, they do not suggest the replacement of the <b>pure</b> <b>tone</b> screening plus tympanometry battery. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
