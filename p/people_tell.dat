5|$|Various {{regions of}} Africa have folkloric tales of beings with vampiric abilities: in West Africa the Ashanti <b>people</b> <b>tell</b> of the iron-toothed and tree-dwelling asanbosam, and the Ewe {{people of the}} adze, which can {{take the form of}} a firefly and hunts children. The Eastern Cape region of South Africa has the impundulu, which can {{take the form of a}} large taloned bird and can summon thunder and lightning, and the Betsileo people of Madagascar tell of the ramanga, an outlaw or living vampire who drinks the blood and eats the nail {{clippings}} of nobles.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} {{appearances}} Raiden is a rookie agent who, {{as a result}} of training only in virtual reality, is inexperienced. However, he later reveals that he was feared as a child soldier—known as —who killed several enemies in a civil war and is ashamed of his past. This affects Raiden's personality; he begins to believe he is only useful in the battlefield and his relationship with his girlfriend, Rosemary, would not work. Manipulation by the Patriots causes him to believe he does not have free will. Raiden is encouraged by Solid Snake not to be concerned with what <b>people</b> <b>tell</b> him but to rely on himself to face his problems.|$|E
25|$|In Human, All Too Human, philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche {{suggested}} {{that those who}} refrain from lying may do so {{only because of the}} difficulty involved in maintaining the lie. This is consistent with his general philosophy that divides (or ranks) people according to strength and ability; thus, some <b>people</b> <b>tell</b> the truth only out of weakness.|$|E

25|$|When {{children}} first learn how lying works, {{they lack the}} moral understanding of when to refrain from doing it. This takes years of watching <b>people</b> <b>tell</b> lies, {{and the results of}} these lies, to develop a proper understanding. Propensity to lie varies greatly between children, some doing so habitually and others being habitually honest. Habits in this regard are likely to change in early adulthood.|$|E
25|$|The wendigo is a {{creature}} {{appearing in the}} legends of the Algonquian people. It is thought of variously as a malevolent cannibalistic spirit that could possess humans or a monster that humans could physically transform into. Those who indulged in cannibalism were at particular risk, and the legend appears to have reinforced this practice as taboo. The Zuni <b>people</b> <b>tell</b> {{the story of the}} Átahsaia - a giant who cannibalizes his fellow demons and seeks out human flesh.|$|E
25|$|Local legends by the Chagga <b>people</b> <b>tell</b> how a {{man named}} Tone once {{provoked}} a god, Ruwa, to bring famine upon the land. The people became angry at Tone, forcing him to flee. Nobody wanted to protect him but a solitary dweller who had stones that turned miraculously into cattle. The dweller bid that Tone never open the stable of the cattle. When Tone did not heed the warning and the cattle escaped, Tone followed them, but the fleeing cattle threw up hills to run on, including Mawenzi and Kibo. Tone finally collapsed on Kibo, ending the pursuit.|$|E

500|$|In Infinite Love is the Only Truth (2005), Icke {{introduces}} {{his three}} categories of people. The Brotherhood are [...] "interactive software programs", or [...] "Red Dresses". They lack consciousness and free will, and their human bodies are holographic veils. A second group, the [...] "sheeple" [...] (the vast majority of humanity), are conscious, but do as they are told and are the Brotherhood's main energy source. They include the [...] "repeaters", people in positions of influence who repeat what other <b>people</b> <b>tell</b> them; he cites doctors, teachers and journalists as examples.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, after {{returning}} from the tour of England documented in the film Dont Look Back, Dylan was unhappy with the public's expectations of him, {{as well as the}} direction his career was taking, and seriously considered quitting the music business. In a 1966 Playboy interview, he described his dissatisfaction: [...] "Last spring, I guess I was going to quit singing. I was very drained, and the way things were going, it was a very draggy situation... But 'Like a Rolling Stone' changed it all. I mean it was something that I myself could dig. It's very tiring having other <b>people</b> <b>tell</b> you how much they dig you if you yourself don't dig you." ...|$|E

500|$|He also said, [...] "I {{was pretty}} much left alone for two days, and I let [...] in at the end. I played her [...] song by song, and she'd burst into tears. 'Oh! It's so beautiful!', 'Oh, it's so beautiful!' You know, {{this is the same}} stuff that <b>people</b> <b>tell</b> me, 'Oh! It's so suicidal!'" [...] The {{original}} release of The Marble Index included eight of 12 songs Nico recorded. [...] "Roses in the Snow", [...] "Nibelungen", [...] "Sagen die Gelehrten" [...] and [...] "Reve Reveiller" [...] were left off the album. The finished album was barely 30 minutes long, which [...] "was as much apparently as Frazier Mohawk, mixing and sequencing it, could stand without starting to feel suicidal".|$|E
500|$|In July 1962, after Hendrix was {{discharged}} from the U.S. Army, he entered a small club in Clarksville, Tennessee. Drawn in by live music, he stopped for a drink and ended up spending most of the $400 he had saved. He explained: [...] "I went in this jazz joint and had a drink. I liked it and I stayed. <b>People</b> <b>tell</b> me I get foolish, good-natured sometimes. Anyway, I guess I felt real benevolent that day. I must have been handing out bills to anyone that asked me. I {{came out of that}} place with sixteen dollars left." [...] According to the authors Steven Roby and Brad Schreiber: [...] "Alcohol would later be the scourge of his existence, driving him to fits of pique, even rare bursts of atypical, physical violence." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 6, 2010, two colored vinyl {{editions of}} Old Record were released. In an {{interview}} with USA Today in 2011, McKinnon said that the band [...] "had a bunch of <b>people</b> <b>tell</b> us we'd sold out — and that was our first album" [...] when they had released And Their Name Was Treason. On July 2, 2013, Victory announced that Old Record was to be reissued again on vinyl, in 3 different colors, from July 9: standard black, and limited edition copies of both pink and clear with black smoke. In an October 2013 interview, McKinnon revealed the band had to re-record the whole album {{in a couple of}} days due to pressure from Victory-owner Tony Brummel.

500|$|Cisneros says of this moment: So to me {{it began}} there, and that's when I {{intentionally}} started writing {{about all the things}} in my culture that were different from them—the poems that are these city voices—the first part of Wicked Wicked Ways—and the stories in House on Mango Street. I think it's ironic that at the moment when I was practically leaving an institution of learning, I began realizing in which ways institutions had failed me. Drawing on Mexican and Southwestern popular culture and conversations in the city streets, Cisneros wrote to convey the lives of people she identified with. Literary critic Jacqueline Doyle has described Cisneros's passion for hearing the personal stories that <b>people</b> <b>tell</b> and her commitment to expressing the voices of marginalized people through her work, such as the [...] "thousands of silent women" [...] whose struggles are portrayed in The House on Mango Street.|$|E
500|$|True Detective explores Christianity and the {{dichotomy}} {{between religion and}} rationality. Born into a devout Catholic household, Pizzolatto said that as a child he saw religion as storytelling that acts [...] "as {{an escape from the}} truth". According to Andrew Romano at The Daily Beast, the season alludes to Pizzolatto's childhood and creates a parallel between Christianity and the supernatural theology of [...] "Carcosa": [...] "Both...are stories. Stories <b>people</b> <b>tell</b> themselves to escape reality. Stories that 'violate every law of the universe.'" [...] Romano believed this message is not critical of religion per se, rather it shows how the [...] "power of storytelling" [...] and religious zeal [...] "can wind [...] up in some pretty sick places." [...] Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly has opined that the show becomes more self-aware through Cohle's harsh critiques of religion, which he viewed as a vehicle for commentary about pop culture escapism. Stapleton observed that the crimes on True Detective—through its victims and the implications of sacrifice and sexual violence—"respond to the conservative Christianity from which they originate, and seek to exploit the opportunities for the pleasure of transgression such a structure offers." ...|$|E
500|$|Colbert {{describes}} himself as racially color-blind and unable to visually identify a person's race, explaining, [...] "Now, I don't see race ... <b>People</b> <b>tell</b> me I'm white, and I believe them, because I own a lot of Jimmy Buffett albums." [...] His race-blindness is a recurring joke, and this statement is often repeated on the show with different punch lines. For this same reason he believed that he was black when he had an emotional breakdown after watching Obama's inauguration video. He later qualified these statements in his book, stating, [...] "When I say I don't see race, I mean I don't see Black people. But I can spot a Mexican at a hundred paces." [...] Despite all these claims, Colbert often boasts {{that he has a}} large number of token minority friends (including Jon Stewart as [...] " [...] Jewish friend" [...] and Oprah Winfrey as [...] " [...] black friend"), although in the photos shown these friends appear decidedly uninterested in him. He has stated a similar inability to distinguish between the sexes, claiming to only [...] "see an American". This comes in contradiction of his at times sexist behavior, for instance, calling only on men during an open discussion with his audience on women's issues.|$|E
5000|$|Architectural Record {{called the}} film [...] "A {{document}} of America {{at its most}} vulnerable." [...] The New York Times reviewer Nicolas Rapold said [...] "the movie’s biggest weakness comes with its tendency to film <b>people</b> <b>telling</b> us what’s going on rather than having us observe." ...|$|R

[...] Some of her earliest works of poetry were recognized locally.|$|R
500|$|The {{details of}} Angelou's life {{described}} in her seven autobiographies and in numerous interviews, speeches, and articles {{tended to be}} inconsistent. [...] Critic Mary Jane Lupton has explained that when Angelou spoke about her life, she did so eloquently but informally and [...] "with no time chart in front of her". [...] For example, she was married at least twice, but never clarified {{the number of times}} she had been married, [...] "for fear of sounding frivolous"; according to her autobiographies and to Gillespie, she married Tosh Angelos in 1951 and Paul du Feu in 1974, and began her relationship with Vusumzi Make in 1961, but never formally married him. [...] Angelou held many jobs, including some in the sex trade, working as a prostitute and madame for lesbians, as she described in her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name. [...] In a 1995 interview, Angelou said, [...] "I wrote about my experiences because I thought too many <b>people</b> <b>tell</b> young folks, 'I never did anything wrong. Who, Moi? – never I. I have no skeletons in my closet. In fact, I have no closet.' They lie like that and then young people find themselves in situations and they think, 'Damn I must be a pretty bad guy. My mom or dad never did anything wrong.' They can’t forgive themselves and go on with their lives".|$|E
500|$|Themes in Lavigne's music include {{messages}} of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent view. Lavigne believes her [...] "songs are about being yourself {{no matter what}} and going after your dreams even if your dreams are crazy and even if <b>people</b> <b>tell</b> you they're never going to come true." [...] On her debut album, Let Go, Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as [...] "Losing Grip", instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as [...] "Complicated", saying that [...] "the songs I did with the Matrix... were good for my first record, but I don't {{want to be that}} pop anymore." [...] Lavigne's second album, Under My Skin, had deeper personal themes underlying each song, saying that [...] "I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about... Like boys, like dating or relationships". Musically, it's considered her heaviest album that showcased ballads and rocker songs with a more post-grunge sound that verged on nü-metal style. [...] In contrast, her third album, The Best Damn Thing, was not personal to her. [...] "Some of the songs I wrote didn't even mean that much to me. It's not like some personal thing I'm going through." [...] Her objective in writing the album was simply to [...] "make it fun". The style has been praised for her ability to combine bubblegum pop melodies with punk rock riffs. Goodbye Lullaby, Lavigne's fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records, with Lavigne describing the album as [...] "more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very emotional". Ian McKellen defined her as [...] "a punk chanteuse, a post-grunge valkyrie, with the wounded soul of a poet and the explosive pugnacity of a Canadian" [...] on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in 2007.|$|E
