40|$|Abstract A “low-balling {{strategy}} ” by bidding contractors {{has increasingly}} {{been recognized as}} an important issue in public infrastructure procurement. Public works contracts are often imperfect and renegotiated after the contract award. Given the expectation for ex <b>post</b> <b>adjustments,</b> bidders seem motivated {{to take advantage of}} the low-balling strategy. This paper analyzes the endogeneity between the bid strategy and ex <b>post</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Using procurement data on rural road projects in Nepal, it shows that the bid strategy and adjustments are determined endogenously in the system. Anticipating cost and time overruns, firms would likely undercut normal bid prices. Then, ex <b>post</b> contract <b>adjustments</b> actually happen, because of their too aggressive bids. ...|$|R

For example, ICSC calculated that U.

These adjustments are derived and documented. Several examples of estimation are provided: powers of volatility, leverage effect, and integrated betas.

40|$|Auditor-Client {{negotiation}} about difficult client {{accounting issues}} involves the auditor, the client, {{and various other}} parties on both the client and auditor side. On the auditor side, the Professional Practice Department {{has been reported to}} {{play a significant role in}} the financial reporting process, yet is rarely the focus of academic study. In this study, I investigate how communicating the involvement of the Professional Practice Department (PPD) to top management using different influence techniques impacts negotiated outcomes between audit partners and top management. I examine the impact of communicating the involvement of the PPD in the context of two other variables found in prior auditing literature to be important in the negotiation process, auditor type and CFO (Chief Financial Officer) preferred auditor-type. While auditors must attest that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, they also must ensure they foster a functional working relationship with the client. The auditor-client context is unique, and takes place within an on-going relationship where expectations and preferences have been established. Therefore, I examine these negotiation outcomes while incorporating a key contextual variable, auditor-type, in the negotiations. Both the CFO's preference for auditor-type, as well as actual auditor-type will be examined in addition to the specific influence tactic. I use a 3 x 2 x 2 fully factorial design to experimentally analyze the impact of two manipulated variable (influence tactic and auditor-type) and one measured variable (CFO preference for auditor-type) on two dependent variables. The two dependent variables are the CFO's willingness to <b>post</b> an <b>adjustment</b> to the financial statements and the CFO's satisfaction with the audit partner. I report the results of an audit negotiation experiment in which 154 highly experienced CFOs responded to a case scenario that incorporated or measured the three key variables (influence tactic communicating PPD involvement, auditor-type and CFO preference for auditor type). My results indicate that using the most aggressive influence tactic to communicate the Professional Practice Department's involvement had a mixed effect on the CFOs willingness to <b>post</b> <b>adjustments</b> to the financial statements. The CFOs in this influence condition that were paired with an accommodating auditor-type reported a higher willingness to adjust the financial statements while CFOs paired with a proactive and advising auditor-type reported a lower willingness to <b>post</b> <b>adjustments.</b> All CFOs reported less satisfaction with the audit partner when the most aggressive influence tactic was used to communicate the Professional Practice Department's inyolvement. Furthermore, the CFO's preference for an auditor-type significantly affects negotiation outcomes. CFOs that prefer more proactive and advising audit partners are more likely to <b>post</b> <b>adjustments</b> to the financial statements, regardless of whether or not. they are informed of the Professional Practice Department's involvement. These same CFOs report a high level of satisfaction with the audit partner and their satisfaction is not impacted by the type of audit partner they are paired with. CFOs that prefer more reactive and accommodating audit partners are less willing to adjust the financial statements and report less satisfaction (dissatisfaction), when paired with proactive and advising audit partners. These results highlight the importance of the existing relationship within the auditor-client dyads and help support findings from auditor-client negotiation research which show that prevailing expectations of the CFO are a contextually important feature of audit negotiation and should be incorporated into more research. I also show that aggressive tactics can help persuade some CFOs to adjust the financial statements; however, consistently pushing too aggressively results in reduced cooperation. Furthermore, there are large costs in terms of the CFO's satisfaction with the audit partner in using aggressive tactics, and therefore, practically speaking the tactic that could potentially be the most effective may result in a lost client...|$|R

Researchers generally agree that economic growth does not always reduce poverty. Indeed, the effectiveness of growth in reducing poverty depends on the level of inequality in the population. Growth that increases inequality may not reduce poverty; growth that does not change inequality (distribution-neutral growth) and growth that reduces inequality (pro-poor growth) result in poverty reduction. Policy makers can promote pro-poor growth by empowering the poor to participate in growth directly. Policy makers can focus on interventions that improve productivity in smallholder agriculture, particularly export crops, increasing employment of semi-skilled or unskilled labour, promoting technology adoption, increasing access to production assets, as well as effective participation in input and product markets. Also, increasing public spending on social services and infrastructure made possible by redistribution of the benefits of growth benefits the poor, indirectly...|$|R
40|$|Creatinine {{clearance}} (CrCl) {{is often}} used to determine initial dosing of renally excreted antineoplastic drugs. CrCl is typically estimated on the basis of serum creatinine, for which the Cockcroft–Gault formula is commonly used. 1 It has been argued that dosing based on this formula should be held as the “gold standard ” because it is the basis of information on product labels. 2, 3 To verify this claim, we reviewed the product labels of 29 antineoplastic drugs available in Canada for which dose adjustment is required for patients with impaired renal function (Table 1). For 11 (38 %) of the drugs, the labels provided a general caution or no recommendation at all (Table 2), whereas for 7 (24 %), renal function was described in terms of serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen. As such, the labels for only 11 (38 %) of the drugs provided specific information on renal dose <b>adjustments</b> (<b>Table</b> 2), and for only 2 drugs (capecitabine and pemetrexed) did the labels actually mention the Cockcroft– Gault formula...|$|R

40|$|The paper readdresses the post-award {{adjustment}} {{problem in}} infrastructure procurement. Cost overruns and project delays {{have long been}} chronic difficulties in implementing infrastructure projects. Too many ex <b>post</b> <b>adjustments</b> not only incur significant adaptation costs to contractors but also undermine efficiency, credibility and predictability of the budget execution. The paper analyzes the case of public road procurement in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is found that if large post-award amendments are anticipated, bidders are likely to reflect them to their bids systematically. Under the perfect foresight assumption, one dollar of anticipated contract adjustment would decrease the bid strategy by 7 cents; the effect seems to be offset largely by the incurred adaptation cost to contractors, which is estimated at 93 cents per one dollar of contract adjustment. Therefore, the ex post adaptation approach is much costly, {{and it may be}} better to formulate the accurate budget on a more solid basis and use the agreed contract as high-powered incentives to contractors.

Bone marrow suppression, notably thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, which may contribute to bleeding and overwhelming infections in an already compromised patient, is the most common and severe of the toxic effects of CeeNU (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Since the major toxicity is delayed bone marrow suppression, blood counts should be monitored weekly for at least 6 weeks after a dose (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). At the recommended dosage, courses of CeeNU should not be given more frequently than every 6 weeks.

Empirical results on two samples of US and EU stocks show that the 'fundamental' earning price ratio (E/P) explains a significant share of cross-sectional variation of the observed E/P, this impact being stronger in the US market. It is also found that: (i) the fundamental component of the E/P has superior explanatory power than simpler measures of expected earnings growth; (ii) 'non-fundamental' components, interpreted as signals reducing asymmetric information (such as firm size, the number of forecasts and the chartist momentum), mitigate {{the role of the}} fundamentals; (iii) current deviations from the fundamentals are affected by ex <b>post</b> <b>adjustment</b> of publicly available information in the EU sample.
