5|$|Power {{was sentenced}} to eight to twelve {{years in prison for}} the bank robbery, and five years and a $10,000 fine for the National Guard armory crimes. Additionally, judge Robert Banks of Suffolk County Superior Court imposed a {{probation}} condition that <b>Power</b> <b>could</b> not profit from her crime. Banks remarked that the sentence negotiated was inadequate.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of war, RAF Bomber Command firmly believed that air <b>power</b> <b>could</b> win wars {{without the need for}} naval and land fighting. It was thought the bomber would always get through. Tightly flown bomber formations with heavy defensive armament were thought capable of warding off enemy fighters even without fighter escort. However, the RAF lacked a four-engine bomber with adequate defensive protection which could carry heavy bomb loads to German targets. The only possible targets that were within range of British bombers were the industrial regions of the Ruhr.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with these}} {{proposals}} to examine nuclear {{power as a}} possible response to climate change, anti-nuclear campaigners and scientists in Australia emphasised claims that nuclear <b>power</b> <b>could</b> not significantly substitute for other power sources, and that uranium mining itself could become {{a significant source of}} greenhouse gas emissions. Anti-nuclear campaigns were given added impetus by public concern about the sites for possible reactors: fears exploited by anti-nuclear power political parties in the lead-up to a national election in 2007.|$|E

50|$|None {{of these}} <b>powers</b> <b>could</b> be {{exercised}} by the monarch, under the Conditions, without {{the approval of}} the Supreme Privy Council. Or else they would face the possibility of deposition.|$|R
50|$|By mid-1918, U-boat losses {{had reached}} {{unacceptable}} levels, and {{the morale of}} their crews had drastically deteriorated; by the autumn {{it became clear that}} the Central <b>Powers</b> <b>could</b> not win the war.|$|R
5|$|George's {{distrust}} of the Tories aided the passing of power to the Whigs. Whig dominance would grow to be so great under George that the Tories would not return to power for another half-century. After the election, the Whig-dominated Parliament passed the Septennial Act 1715, which extended the maximum duration of Parliament to seven years (although it could be dissolved earlier by the Sovereign). Thus Whigs already in <b>power</b> <b>could</b> remain in such a position for a greater period of time.|$|E
5|$|Total wind <b>power</b> <b>could</b> be {{captured}} {{only if the}} wind velocity is reduced to zero. In a realistic wind turbine this is impossible, as the captured air must also leave the turbine. A relation between the input and output wind velocity must be considered. Using the concept of stream tube, the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine is 59% of the total theoretical wind power (see: Betz' law).|$|E
5|$|Christy is {{the oldest}} of Carl and Helen Jenkins's two daughters. Both of her parents are mortal, and her powers were {{inherited}} from her maternal grandmother, making her a carrier of the genes determining magical ability. As a witch, Christy possesses the basic ability to cast spells, perform rituals, brew potions, scry for lost people or objects {{through the use of}} a crystal pendant, and communicate with the dead. She also possesses an advanced form of telepathy, enabling her to hear and project her thoughts, as well as channeling other magical creatures' powers. Carl and Helen Jenkins (David Starzyk and Barbara Niven) said Christy heard voices prior to her kidnapping, implying that this power was already active. As a firestarter, Christy had the power of pyrokinesis; this <b>power</b> <b>could</b> be augmented by Billie's projection powers to vanquish demons previously believed to be invincible. Christy was identified as the Key to the Ultimate Power due to her relationship with Billie. Demain of Television Without Pity compared Christy to Buffy the Vampire Slayer character Dawn Summers as they were both referenced as the Key.|$|E

50|$|These <b>powers</b> <b>could</b> be {{exercised}} {{in an emergency}} such as a constitutional crisis (such as surrounded the People's Budget of 1909), or in wartime. They would also be very relevant {{in the event of}} a hung parliament.|$|R
5|$|Electrical {{power is}} usually {{generated}} by electro-mechanical generators driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion, or the heat released from nuclear reactions; or {{from other sources}} such as kinetic energy extracted from wind or flowing water. The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric {{power in the world}} using a variety of heat sources. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. The invention {{in the late nineteenth century}} of the transformer meant that electrical <b>power</b> <b>could</b> be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed.|$|E
5|$|In January 1964, General Khánh ousted General Dương Văn Minh as {{the leader}} of South Vietnam's {{military}} junta in a bloodless coup. Although Khánh had made considerable efforts to consolidate his power, opposition to his rule began to grow as he tightened censorship laws, banned protests and allowed police arbitrary search and imprisonment powers. Khánh drafted a new constitution, which would have expanded his power within the military junta. In response to General Khánh's political manoeuvres the South Vietnamese people, predominately Buddhists, held large demonstrations in the cities calling {{for an end to the}} draconian laws which had limited the people’s political freedom. Fearing that his <b>power</b> <b>could</b> be weakened by those demonstrations, General Khánh immediately repealed his constitution and new police powers. He promised to reinstate civilian rule and remove members of the Catholic-based Cần lao from power.|$|E
5|$|The gods were {{believed}} to manifest in many forms. The Egyptians had a complex conception of the human soul, consisting of several parts. The spirits of the gods were composed {{of many of these}} same elements. The ba was the component of the human or divine soul that affected the world around it. Any visible manifestation of a god's <b>power</b> <b>could</b> be called its ba; thus, the sun was called the ba of Ra. A depiction of a deity was considered a ka, another component of its being, which acted as a vessel for that deity's ba to inhabit. The cult images of gods that were the focus of temple rituals, as well as the sacred animals that represented certain deities, {{were believed}} to house divine bas in this way. Gods could be ascribed many bas and kas, which were sometimes given names representing different aspects of the god's nature. Everything in existence was said {{to be one of the}} kas of Atum the creator god, who originally contained all things within himself, and one deity could be called the ba of another, meaning that the first god is a manifestation of the other's power. Divine body parts could act as separate deities, like the Eye of Ra and Hand of Atum, both of which were personified as goddesses. The gods were so full of life-giving power that even their bodily fluids could transform into other living things; humankind was said to have sprung from the creator god's tears, and the other deities from his sweat.|$|E

He also distrusted the police.|$|R
25|$|Pedal Power is {{the most}} {{familiar}} as used for bicycles or tricycles, popular for light transport since the late 19th Century. The beach-side quadracycle which was patented in 1853 demonstrated that <b>power</b> <b>could</b> be drawn {{from more than one}} cyclist.|$|E
25|$|The Constitution {{increased}} Congressional {{power to}} organize, arm and discipline the state militias, {{to use them}} to enforce the laws of Congress, suppress rebellions within the states and repel invasions.

25|$|As of 2007, {{wind energy}} {{represented}} only 1.7% of Illinois's energy production, {{and it was}} estimated that wind <b>power</b> <b>could</b> provide 5–10% of the state's energy needs.
