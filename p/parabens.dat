Such promotions generally result in a token donation to a breast cancer-related charity by taking advantage of the consumers' fear of cancer and grief for people who have died to drive sales. Critics say that these promotions, which net more than US $30 million each year just for fundraising powerhouse Susan G. Komen for the Cure, do little more than support the marketing machines that produce them. Komen says that corporate sponsorships are necessary to pay for the organization's efforts: in the 2010 fiscal year it spent $175 million on public health education and awareness campaigns, $75 million on medical research and about $67 million on treatment and screenings for patients.|$|E

The degradation of methyl <b>paraben</b> and synthetic municipal wastewater mixture was evaluated at their respective concentrations of 10 mg/L and 50 mg COD/L.

The BOD removal efficiencies for methyl <b>paraben</b> and municipal wastewater mixture were higher than those for wastewaters containing only methyl <b>paraben.</b> The influent initial pH was around 4. 7 because of hydrolysis of methyl <b>paraben,</b> during which hydrogen ions were released.

40|$|In thisproject, {{solubility}} of butyl <b>paraben</b> in 7 puresolvents and 5 ethanol aqueous solvents {{has been}} determined at from 1 ℃to 50 ℃. Thermodynamic properties of butyl <b>paraben</b> have been measured by DifferentialScanning Calorimetey. Relationship between molar solubility of butyl <b>paraben</b> in 6 pure solvents and thermodynamic properties has been analyzed. Thisrelationship suggests a method of estimating activity of solute at equilibrium fromcombining solubility data with DSC measurements. Then, activity coefficient accordingto the solubility at different temperatures can be estimated. Duringthe solubility measurements in ethanol aqueous solvents, {{it is found that}} whenbutyl <b>paraben</b> is added into aqueous solutions with certain proportion ethanol,solutions separates into two immiscible liquid layers in equilibrium. Water andethanol are primary in top layer, while the butyl <b>paraben</b> is primary in bottomlayer, but the solution turns to cloudy when two layers of solution are mixed. Theaim of this work was to present the phase behaviour of liquid-liquid-phaseseparation for (butyl <b>paraben</b> + water + ethanol) ternary system from 1 ℃ to 50 ℃at atmospheric pressure. Thearea of liquid-liquid-phase separation region in the ternary phase diagram increaseswith the increasing temperature from 10 ℃to 50 ℃. In thisstudy, more than several hundreds of nucleation experiments of butyl <b>paraben</b> havebeen investigated in ethyl acetate, propanol, acetone and 90 % ethanol aqueoussolution. Induction time of butyl <b>paraben</b> {{has been determined}} at 3 differentsupersaturation levels in these solvents, respectively. Free energy ofnucleation, solid-liquid interfacial energy, and nuclei critical radius havebeen determined according to the classical nucleation theory. Statistical analysis ofinduction time reveals that the nucleation is a stochastic process with widevariation even at the same experiment condition. Butyl <b>paraben</b> nucleates most difficultlyin 90 % ethanol than in other 3 solvents, and most easily in acetone. The interfacialenergy of butyl <b>paraben</b> in these solvents tends to increasing with decreasemole fraction solubility in these solvents. Coolingcrystallizations with different proportions of butyl <b>paraben,</b> water and ethanolhave been observed by Focused Beam Reflectance Method, Parallel VirtualMachine, and On-line Infrared. The FBRM, IR curves and the PVM photos show someof the solutions appeared liquid-liquid phase separation during coolingcrystallization process. The results suggest that if solutions went throughliquid-liquid phase separation region during the cooling crystallizationprocess the distribution of crystals crystal was poor. Droplets from solutions withsame proportion butyl <b>paraben</b> but different proportions of water and ethanolhave been observed under microscope.

40|$|Mechanisms of methyl {{p-hydroxybenzoate}} (methyl <b>paraben)</b> action in allergic reactions were investigated {{by measuring the}} intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) and histamine release in rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMCs). In {{the presence or absence}} of extracellular Ca 2 +, methyl <b>paraben</b> (0. 1 – 10 mM) increased [Ca 2 +]i, in a concentration-dependent manner. Under both the conditions, methyl <b>paraben</b> alone did not evoke histamine release. In RPMCs pretreated with a protein kinase C (PKC) activator (phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) 3 and 10 nM), methyl <b>paraben</b> (0. 3 – 3 mM) induced histamine release. However, a high concentration (10 mM) of the agent did not increase the histamine release. U 73122 (0. 1 and 0. 5 μM), an inhibitor of phospholipase C (PLC), significantly inhibited the methyl paraben-induced histamine release in PMA-pretreated RPMCs. U 73343 (0. 5 μM), an inactive analogue of U 73122, did not inhibit the histamine release caused by methyl <b>paraben.</b> In Ca 2 +-free solution, PLC inhibitors (U 73122 0. 1 and 0. 5 μM, D 609 1 – 10 μM) inhibited the methyl paraben-induced increase in [Ca 2 +]i, whereas U 73343 (0. 5 μM) did not. Xestospongin C (2 – 20 μM) and 2 aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (30 and 100 μM), blockers of the inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) receptor, inhibited the methyl paraben-induced increase in [Ca 2 +]i in Ca 2 +-free solution. In conclusion, methyl <b>paraben</b> causes an increase in [Ca 2 +]i, which may be due to release of Ca 2 + from storage sites by IP 3 via activation of PLC in RPMCs. In addition, methyl <b>paraben</b> possibly has some inhibitory effects on histamine release via unknown mechanisms...|$|R
