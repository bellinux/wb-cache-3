The medical records of 118 patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer in our hospital between January 2006 and August 2015 were reviewed. The nasopharyngeal cancer group was further sub grouped according to {{the presence or absence of}} distant metastasis and TNM (tumour – T, node – N, metastasis – M) classification. A control group consisted of 120 healthy patients. The platelet and leucocyte values at the time of the initial diagnosis were recorded. Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> values were significantly higher in the nasopharyngeal cancer group.

40|$|The {{results of}} the Coulter counter S plus II {{platelet}} volume analysis were studied in 100 patients with reactive thrombocytosis (platelet count greater than 500 X 10 (9) /l), in 30 patients with myeloproliferative thrombocytosis, and in 32 patients with chronic myeloproliferative disease and a platelet count less than 500 X 10 (9) /l. Patients with reactive thrombocytosis had considerably lower mean platelet volumes than those with myeloproliferative thrombocytosis, or normal subjects. The opposite was true for the <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>width.</b> This index for platelet heterogeneity was normal in reactive, but increased in myeloproliferative thrombocytosis. There were no differences in mean platelet volume or <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> between patients with myeloproliferative disease and a high or normal platelet count. The increased platelet heterogeneity in myeloproliferative disease was caused by an increase of both small and large platelets. The <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> {{seemed to be the}} best variable for the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis. A <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> greater than 17 was found in 26 of the 30 patients with myeloproliferative thrombocytosis but in only five of the 100 patients with reactive thrombocytosis.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the use of}} platelet volume indices {{in the interpretation of}} thrombocytopenia in dogs with systemic disease. Methods: Case records of 80 control dogs and 159 thrombocytopenic dogs with systemic disease were reviewed retrospectively. The relationships between mean platelet volume, <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> and platelet count in systemically well dogs were established. Knowledge of these relationships was used to interpret thrombocytopenia in terms of the underlying disease process.

40|$|Abnormalities of {{platelet}} size {{are one of}} the {{distinguishing features}} of inherited throm-bocytopenias (ITs), and evaluation of blood films is recommended as an essential step for differential diagnosis of these disorders. Nevertheless, what we presently know about this subject is derived mainly from anecdotal evidence. To improve knowledge in this field, we evaluated platelet size on blood films obtained from 376 patients with all 19 forms of IT identified so far and found that these conditions differ not only in mean platelet diameter, but also in <b>platelet</b> diameter <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> and the percentage of platelets with increased or reduced diameters. On the basis of these findings, we propose a new classification of ITs according to platelet size. It distinguishes forms with giant platelets, with large platelets, with normal or slightly increased platelet size, and with normal or slightly decreased platelet size. We also measured platelet diameters in 87 patients with immune thrombocytopenia and identified cut off values for mean platelet diameter and the percentage of platelets with increased or reduced size that have good diagnostic accuracy in differentiating ITs with giant platelets and with normal or slightly decreased platelet size from immune thrombocytopenia and all other forms of IT...|$|R

Methods: The study group included 45 adult patients diagnosed with cutaneous leishmaniasis and treated as inpatients in the dermatology clinic between 2011 and 2014. A group of 45 healthy adults served as a control group. Results: Pre- and post-treatment white blood cell count, neutrophils, and lymphocytes were significantly reduced among the patient group relative to the control group. <b>Platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>width,</b> red cell distribution width, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and platelet/lymphocyte ratio were significantly elevated among the patients compared to the healthy subjects. Pre-treatment white blood cell, lymphocyte and platelet counts were significantly elevated compared to post-treatment counts among the patient cohort. Treatment was associated with reduced eosinophil count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and platelet/lymphocyte ratio relative to pre-treatment status. Conclusion: Routine hematological testing results such as platelet/lymphocyte ratio, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, red cell distribution width, <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>width,</b> and mean platelet volume may be clinically significant markers of the inflammatory state useful in the evaluation of early treatment efficacy among patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} red blood cell (RBC) and platelet indices in addition to white blood cell counts in cattle naturally infected with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). A total of 32 cattle, un-vaccinated against BVDV, aged from 4 months to 9 months, were evaluated. Twenty two of them had clinical disorders regarding respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms in which BVDV infection was virologically con-firmed. Remaining 10 (BVDV free-cattle) were clinically healthy and used as controls. RBC indices (mean cor-puscular volume [MCV], mean corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH], MCH concentration [MCHC], and RBC distri-bution width [RDW]) and platelet indices (plateletcrit [PCT], mean platelet volume [MPV], and <b>platelet</b> size <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> [PDW]) were determined on a Cell-Dyn hematology analyzer. Hematological findings in-cluded neutrophilic leukocytosis or neutropenic leukopenia, lymphopenia, and monocytosis in BVDV-infected cattle. RBC, haemoglobin, and RDW were higher (P<. 001) in infected cattle, but MCV was lower (P<. 001), than those of controls. Platelet count, MPV, and PDW were higher in infected cattle, compared with controls (P<. 05). In conclusion, changes in RBC and platelet indices may reflect changes in RBC and platelet production and reactivity. These indices should be used routinely during the diagnostic workup for BVDV infection in cattle practice. Key Words: Bovine viral diarrhea virus, cattle, platelet indices, red blood cell indices.

ANIMALS: 89 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) and 39 control dogs (not CKCSs). PROCEDURES: Platelet count, MPC concentration, PCDW, and Hct were measured {{by use of}} a hematology analyzer, and CT was measured by use of a platelet function analyzer. Murmur grade and echocardiographic variables (mitral valve regurgitant jet size relative to left atrial area, left atrial-to-aortic diameter ratio, and left ventricular internal dimensions) were recorded. Associations between explanatory variables (sex, age, murmur grade, echocardiographic variables, platelet count, and Hct) and outcomes (CT, MPC concentration, and PCDW) were examined by use of multivariate regression models. RESULTS: A model with 5 variables best explained variation in CT (R(2), 0. 74), with > 60 % of the variance of CT explained by mitral valve regurgitant jet size. The model of best fit to explain variation in MPC concentration included only platelet count (R(2), 0. 24). The model of best fit to explain variation in PCDW included platelet count and sex (R(2), 0. 25). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In this study, a significant effect of mitral valve regurgitant jet size on CT was consistent with platelet dysfunction. However, platelet activation, as assessed {{on the basis of}} the MPC concentration and PCDW, was not a feature of subclinical chronic valvular heart disease in CKCSs...|$|R

Th 8 ere is a discrepancy about the effects of various types of exercise, exercises, especially resistance exercises on coagulation factors. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of 8 weeks single joint and multiple joint resistance training on some coagulation and blood factors of active young men. Materials and Methods 30 subjects (20 - 26 years) were selected with randomly distributed in control group (n= 10), single joint resistance training (n= 10), and multi-joint resistance training (n= 10). The experimental groups performed protocols for 8 weeks, three sessions each week. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine the normality of the data and the differences were compared using the Ancova test and if significant results were reached, Bonferroni test was used. Results The single joint and multi-joint resistance training group had a significant effect on platelet (P< 0. 001). The type of protocol and resistance training did not have a significant effect on <b>Platelet</b> cell <b>distribution</b> <b>Width</b> (P= 0. 34). According to the findings, it can be said that both types of training had a significant effect on hematocrit and Erythrocyte Sedimentation (P= 0. 001), and in general, the effect of resistance training, regardless of its type, was effective on hematocrit and erythrocyte sedimentation (P= 0. 003, P< 0. 001).

40|$|Objective　To {{determined}} the serum lipid profile, coagulation function and platelet parameters {{in patients with}} type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM), and {{provide a basis for}} the prevention of diabetes related complications. Methods　Two-hundred and forty-six T 2 DM patients (113 males and 133 females, aged 60. 2 ± 15. 3 years, disease course 5 - 22 years) hospitalized in the Navy General Hospital of PLA from March to December, 2012, were involved in the present study. The patients were divided into complication group (n= 140) and no complication group (n= 106) according to whether there were diabetes related complications, and 120 healthy individuals were recruited as control group. The levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen (FIB), platelet count (PLT), and <b>platelet</b> size <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> (PDW), mean <b>platelet</b> volume (MPV), and platelet large cell ratio (P-LCR) were determined and compared among the 3 groups. Results　The levels of TG, TC, LDL-C, MPV, PDW, P-LCR and FIB were significantly higher in complication group than those in no complication group and control group (P< 0. 05), and PLT, APTT and PT were significantly lower than those in no complication group and control group (P< 0. 05). No significant difference of HDL-C levels was found among the 3 groups. Conclusions　The blood of patients with T 2 DM was in hyperviscous and/or hypercoagulable states, and it is prone to induce vascular complications.

To evaluate immune-hematological profiles among HIV infected patients compared to HIV/malaria co-infected for ART management improvement. This was a cross sectional study conducted at Infectious Disease Hospital, Kano. A total of 761 consenting adults attending ART clinic were randomly selected and recruited between June and December 2015. Participants' characteristics and clinical details including two previous CD 4 counts were collected. Venous blood sample (4 ml) was collected in EDTA tube for malaria parasite diagnosis by rapid test and confirmed with microscopy. Hematological profiles were analyzed by Sysmex XP- 300 and CD 4 count by Cyflow cytometry. Data was analyzed with SPSS 22. 0 using Chi-Square test for association between HIV/malaria parasites co-infection with age groups, gender, ART, cotrimoxazole and usage of treated bed nets. Mean hematological profiles by HIV/malaria co-infection and HIV only were compared using independent t-test and mean CD 4 count tested by mixed design repeated measures ANOVA. Statistical significant difference at probability of < 0. 05 was considered for all variables. Of the 761 HIV infected, 64 % were females, {{with a mean age of}} ± (SD) 37. 30 (10. 4) years. Prevalence of HIV/malaria co-infection was 27. 7 % with Plasmodium falciparum specie accounting for 99. 1 %. No statistical significant difference was observed between HIV/malaria co-infection in association to age (p = 0. 498) and gender (p = 0. 789). A significantly (p = 0. 026) higher prevalence (35. 2 %) of co-infection was observed among non-ART patients compared to (26 %) ART patients. Prevalence of co-infection was significantly lower (20. 0 %) among cotrimoxazole users compared to those not on cotrimoxazole (37 %). The same significantly lower co-infection prevalence (22. 5 %) was observed among treated bed net users compared to those not using treated bed nets (42. 9 %) (p = 0. 001). Out of 16 hematology profiles evaluated, six showed significant difference between the two groups (i) packed cell volume (p = < 0. 001), (ii) mean cell volume (p = 0. 005), (iii) mean cell hemoglobin concentration (p = 0. 011), (iv) absolute lymphocyte count (p = 0. 022), (v) neutrophil percentage count (p = 0. 020) and (vi) <b>platelets</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> (p = < 0. 001). Current mean CD 4 count cell/μl (349 ± 12) was significantly higher in HIV infected only compared to co-infected (306 ± 17), (p = 0. 035). A significantly lower mean CD 4 count (234. 6 ± 6. 9) was observed among respondents on ART compared to non-ART (372. 5 ± 13. 2), p< 0. 001, mean difference = - 137. 9).

Material and Method: Patients with HCV infection who applied to an Infectious Diseases clinic between 01 January 2012 and 01 June 2015 were evaluated retrospectively. Overall, 21 male HCV patients who underwent percutaneous liver biopsy and 22 gender-and age- matched healthy controls were included in the study. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS 15. 0. Results: There was no significant difference in age variable between the patients group with an age range of 21 - 41 years [22 (Iq= 4), 24. 62 ± 5. 84 years] and the control group with an age range of 21 - 41 years [22, 5 (Iq= 5), 24. 59 ± 5. 21 years]. The distribution of fibrosis scores among HCV patients was 23. 8 % fibrosis score 1, 61. 9 % fibrosis score 2, and only 14. 3 % fibrosis score 3. Lymphocyte counts, platelet counts, PLR, <b>platelet</b> volume, <b>distribution</b> <b>width,</b> and plateletcrit values were lower, and mean platelet volume (MPV) values were higher, in the patients group compared with controls, but there was no statistical difference between the two groups.

The association of these platelet indices {{with a number}} of biochemical, environmental and clinical variables was studied in a large cohort of the general population. DESIGN AND METHODS: Men and women (n= 18, 097, 52 % women, 56 ± 12 years) were randomly recruited from various villages in Molise (Italy) in the framework of the population-based cohort study "Moli-sani". Hemochromocytometric analyses were performed using an automatic analyzer (Beckman Coulter, IL, Milan, Italy). Associations of platelet indices with dependent variables were investigated by multivariable linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Full models including age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure, smoking, menopause, white and red blood cell counts, mean corpuscular volume, D-dimers, C-reactive protein, high-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, triglycerides, glucose, and drug use explained 16 %, 21 %, 1. 9 % and 4. 7 % of platelet count, plateletcrit, mean platelet volume and <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> variability, respectively; variables that appeared to be most strongly associated were white blood cell count, age, and sex. Platelet count, mean platelet volume and plateletcrit were positively associated with white blood cell count, while <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> was negatively associated with white blood cell count. Platelet count and plateletcrit were also positively associated with C-reactive protein and D-dimers (P< 0. 0001). Each of the other variables, although associated with platelet indices in a statistically significant manner, only explained less than 0. 5 % of their variability.

MPV was significantly lower in pretreatment period (8. 5 ± 1. 1) than in posttreatment (9 ± 1. 1) period (p= 0. 025). Conclusion: We suggest that RDW and MPV alterations begin in early stages of Vitamin B 12 deficiency before development of cytopenias. However, to confirm our results,  prospective studies with a larger cohort are needed.  </p...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> was {{recently}} {{identified as a}} predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with previous stroke. Red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> is also higher in patients with stroke compared with those without. However, there are no data on the association of red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width,</b> assessed during the acute phase of ischemic stroke, with stroke severity and functional outcome. In the present study, we sought to investigate this relationship and ascertain the main determinants of red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> in this population. METHODS: We used data from the Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne for patients between January 2003 and December 2008. Red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> was generated at admission by the Sysmex XE- 2100 automated cell counter from ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid blood samples stored at room temperature until measurement. An χ(2) -test was performed to compare frequencies of categorical variables between different red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> quartiles, and one-way analysis of variance for continuous variables. The effect of red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> on severity and functional outcome was investigated in univariate and multivariate robust regression analysis. Level of significance was set at 95 %. RESULTS: There were 1504 patients (72 ± 15 · 76 years, 43 · 9 % females) included in the analysis. Red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> was significantly associated to NIHSS (β-value= 0 · 24, P= 0 · 01) and functional outcome (odds ratio= 10 · 73 for poor outcome, P< 0 · 001) at univariate analysis but not multivariate. Prehospital Rankin score (β= 0 · 19, P< 0 · 001), serum creatinine (β= 0 · 008, P< 0 · 001), hemoglobin (β=- 0 · 009, P< 0 · 001), mean platelet volume (β= 0 · 09, P< 0 · 05), age (β= 0 · 02, P< 0 · 001), low ejection fraction (β= 0 · 66, P< 0 · 001) and antihypertensive treatment (β= 0 · 32, P< 0 · 001) were independent determinants of red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width,</b> assessed during the early phase of acute ischemic stroke, does not predict severity or functional outcome...|$|R
40|$|Background: Newly formed {{platelets}} {{are associated}} with increased aggregation and adverse outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The mechanisms involved in the regulation of platelet turnover in patients with CAD are largely unknown. Aim: To investigate associations between platelet turnover parameters, thrombopoietin and markers of low-grade inflammation in patients with stable CAD. Furthermore, to explore the relationship between platelet turnover parameters and type 2 diabetes, prior myocardial infarction, smoking, age, gender and renal insufficiency. Methods: We studied 581 stable CAD patients. Platelet turnover parameters (immature platelet fraction, immature platelet count, mean platelet volume, <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> and platelet large cell-ratio) were determined using automated flow cytometry (Sysmex XE- 2100). Furthermore, we measured thrombopoietin and evaluated low-grade inflammation by measurement of high-sensitive CRP and interleukin- 6. Results: We found strong associations between the immature platelet fraction, immature platelet count, mean platelet volume, <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> and platelet large cell ratio (r = 0. 61 – 0. 99, p, 0. 0001). Thrombopoietin levels {{were inversely related to}} all of the platelet turnover parameters (r = 20. 17 – 20. 25, p, 0. 0001). Moreover, thrombopoietin levels were significantly increased in patients with diabetes (p = 0. 03) and in smokers (p = 0. 003). Low-grade inflammatio...|$|E
40|$|Sudden {{sensorineural hearing}} loss (SSNHL) is a common {{otological}} disorder characterized by a hearing loss greater than 30 dB over three consecutive frequencies, in less than 72 hours. It has been established that platelet parameters, such as mean platelet volume, are associated with ischemic heart events, whose clinical manifestations {{are similar to those}} of SSNHL. Hence, we aimed to determine if the platelet count, mean platelet volume and <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> are related to the occurrence and severity of sudden {{sensorineural hearing loss}}. A case-control prospective study was conducted in a teaching hospital in Iran. One hundred-eight patients with SSNHL and an equal number of healthy, age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled in the study. Peripheral venous blood samples were collected from the subjects, and the platelet count, mean platelet volume and <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> were measured with an automated blood cell counter. Analysis of the audiometry and hematological test results using SPSS 22 software showed no statistical correlation between the platelet parameters and the occurrence of SSNHL, but correlation coefficients showed a significant correlation between PDW and hearing loss severity in patients group. However, further investigation is required to unequivocally establish the absence of correlation between the platelet parameters and occurrence of SSNHL...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{red blood}} cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> has been {{associated}} with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. In the present study, we assessed the relationship between red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> values and cardiac troponin I levels in patients admitted with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome. METHODS: We analyzed blood parameters in 251 adult patients who were consecutively admitted to the intensive coronary care unit with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome over a 1 -year period. For all patients, a baseline blood sample was collected for routine hematological testing. Cardiac troponin I was measured at baseline and after 6 h. The patients were diagnosed with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina based on the elevation of cardiac troponin I levels. RESULTS: The red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> was higher in the group with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction compared with the patient group with unstable angina (14. 6 &# 177; 1. 0 vs 13. 06 &# 177; 1. 7, respectively; p&# 8202;=&# 8202; 0. 006). Coronary thrombus was detected more frequently in the group of patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction than in the patients with unstable angina (72 % vs 51 %, respectively; p&# 8202;=&# 8202; 0. 007). Using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for the prediction of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction based on the red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width,</b> the area under the curve was 0. 649 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 546 - 0. 753; p&# 8202;=&# 8202; 0. 006), suggesting a modest model for the prediction of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction using the red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width.</b> At a cut-off value of 14 %, the sensitivity and specificity of the red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> were 73 % and 59 %, respectively. Additionally, the red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> was positively correlated with cardiac troponin I (r&# 8202;=&# 8202; 0. 19; p&# 8202;=&# 8202; 0. 006). CONCLUSION: A greater baseline red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> value was associated with myocardial injury and elevated cardiac troponin I levels in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome. Therefore, the red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> could be considered for risk stratification of acute coronary syndrome patients admitted to emergency departments...|$|R

The prognostic significance of NLR and PLT in cancer was demonstrated in many studies while the role of RDW has been hardly investigated. The present study aimed to assess the association of RDW, NLR, and PLT with survival and tumor grade in glioma patients. Methods: Clinical data from 178 patients with primary gliomas treated in a single institution were retrospectively analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic curves for cutoff value determination, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, various bivariate tests, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed. Results: Patients with high RDW (≥ 13. 95) and NLR (≥ 4) levels had worse overall survival (OS) (Wilcoxon test, P< 0. 026 and P< 0. 003, respectively) while the effect of thrombocytosis (≥ 400 × 109 /L) on prognosis was not significant. Besides, a strong association between RDW and NLR was found (Spearman’s rho = 0. 230, P< 0. 02; χ 2 = 8. 887, P< 0. 03; Mann–Whitney U-test, P< 0. 017). Moreover, RDW and NLR were significantly associated with tumor grade. In univariate Cox analysis, elevated NLR (hazard ratio, HR 1. 385; confidence interval, CI 1. 020 – 1. 881, P< 0. 037), older age (HR 0. 452, CI 0. 329 – 0. 621, P< 0), and higher tumor grade (HR 1. 624, CI 1. 187 – 2. 223, P< 0. 002) were associated with poor outcomes. In the multivariate analysis, tumor grade, age, and Karnofsky performance score were identified as being independently prognostic for OS. Conclusion: Preoperative NLR and RDW values can help to evaluate disease progression and outcomes in patients with gliomas, thereby contributing to patient follow-up optimization.

40|$|Background: The {{red cell}} <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> is a {{biomarker}} of early mortality across various disease states. Aim: To verify whether it may refine estimates of survival in hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: The red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> measured at diagnosis was analyzed {{in relationship to}} mortality by any cause both in a retrospective training cohort (N = 208), and in an independent prospectively collected validation cohort (N = 106) of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Based on Cox proportional hazards modelling, a prognostic index was validated. Results: In the training and the validation cohort, median survival time was respectively 1026 and 868 days in patients with red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> ≤ 14. 6 %, vs. 282 and 340 days in patients with red cell <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> > 14. 6 %; the corresponding hazard ratios were 0. 43 (95 % CI: 0. 31 – 0. 60), p < 0. 0001 and 0. 28 (95 % CI: 0. 17 – 0. 47), p < 0. 0001.

METHODS [...] This was a retrospective study of 78 patients with chronic renal failure undergoing either haemodialysis (n = 57) or intraperitoneal dialysis (n = 21). All patients had a full blood count (in EDTA) measured before starting r-HuEPO and at monthly intervals thereafter up to six months. Variables studied were haematocrit, platelet count, mean platelet volume (MPV) and <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> (PDW).

Study design: In 247 non-smoking and 123 smoking healthy pregnant women the platelet count, the mean platelet volume, the <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>width</b> and the plateletcrit were compared at 0 — 10, 11 — 20, 21 — 30 and 31 — 40 weeks of pregnancy. Exclusion criteria were a diastolic pressure ^ 90 mmHg, an endocrine disease, a coagulation disorder, acetylsalicylic acid or phenprocoumon use. A women was considered a smoker if she smoked more than 4 cigarettes a day. Non-smokers were defined as women reporting no smoking at all. Blood samples were run on the Sysmex NE- 8000. Results: There {{was no significant difference between}} the platelet count in the two groups. In the non-smoking group, the platelet count showed a significant decrease with gestational age (287 X 109 / 1 to 258 X 109 / 1). This was not the case in the smokers group. The mean platelet volume of the smokers was significantly lower than that of the non-smokers in the last ten weeks of pregnancy (10. 4 fl versus 10. 7 fl).
