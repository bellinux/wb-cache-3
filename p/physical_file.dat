While at the Central Bureaucracy, Hermes logs into the computer system with his ID to look up Inspector No. 5's records. However, he and Bender find that the electronic record on Inspector No. 5 has been deleted and that the <b>physical</b> <b>file</b> is also missing. Bender calls Mom's Friendly Robot Company, who created him, and tells her he is defective. Mom attempts to have Bender destroyed {{to cover up the}} existence of a defective robot. The two flee from Mom's Killbots by train and arrive in Tijuana—where Bender was manufactured.|$|E

For the specific case of Mexico, management of medical records is still being done using <b>physical</b> <b>files</b> whether patient attends a public or private physician or hospital.

25|$|The {{database}} {{features of}} the HyperCard system {{are based on the}} storage of the state of all of the objects on the cards in the <b>physical</b> <b>file</b> representing the stack. The database did not exist as a separate system within the HyperCard stack; no database engine or similar construct exists. Instead, the state of any object in the system was considered to be live and editable at any time. From the HyperCard runtime's perspective, {{there was no difference between}} moving a text field on the card and typing into it, both operations simply changed the state of the target object within the stack. Such changes are immediately saved when complete, so typing into a field caused that text to be stored to the stack's <b>physical</b> <b>file.</b> The system operates in a largely stateless fashion, with no need to save during operation. This is in common with many database-oriented systems, although somewhat different from document-based applications.|$|E
500|$|Back at Planet Express, Bender celebrates his new {{outlook on}} life with the other crew members. Meanwhile, Hermes {{secretly}} burns Inspector No. 5's file, whose cover falls away to reveal that he was Inspector No. 5. A flashback reveals that he overrode the [...] "defective" [...] assessment on Bender {{to prevent him from}} being scrapped, then resigned from the company immediately afterward. Hermes' personnel file was deleted, and he stole his own <b>physical</b> <b>file</b> from the Central Bureaucracy; the computer at the Tijuana house was his own, so {{he did not have to}} hack into it. In the present, Hermes smiles quietly over the burning file, happy in knowing he did the right thing.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to find out the form and the type of urban space in the early of Solo, one of the oldest cities in Java. The object of study was approached by rationalistic research. The method of research was carried out by a-three-archive research strategy: primary files; secondary <b>files</b> and <b>physical</b> <b>files.</b> The primary files referred to the old Javanese documentary; the secondary files referred to the document of local, national and international historian; and the <b>physical</b> <b>files</b> referred to the field research that was conducted by interviews and collecting the artefacts. The research found that Solo was firstly formed as a-water-front city. The main buildings that constructed urban space in the early of Solo were a-three-village: Sala, Laweyan and Pajang. The main land element that formed urban space in the early of Solo was River Bengawan Solo. This giant river formed the urban space in Solo until 1750 s. The type of urban space was shaped up from three figures: linear; cluster; and central.

30|$|For {{the third}} design, the issues with this pattern {{are related to}} the {{limitations}} in the design of HBase itself. In HBase, a column family is stored in a single file split across HDFS [15], which means that when accessing a row there is the potential of accessing two <b>physical</b> <b>files.</b> Considering the distributed nature of HBase, this implies that each column family file is not necessarily stored on the same server.

40|$|A large logical {{register}} file {{is important}} to allow effective compiler transformations or to provide a windowed space of registers to allow fast function calls. Unfortunately, a large logical register file can be slow, particularly {{in the context of}} a wide-issue processor which requires an even larger <b>physical</b> register <b>file,</b> and many read and write ports. Previous work has suggested that a register cache can be used to address this problem. This paper proposes a new register caching mechanism in which a number of good features from previous approaches are combined with existing out-of-order processor hardware to implement a register cache for a large logical register file. It does so by separating the logical register <b>file</b> from the <b>physical</b> register <b>file</b> and using a modified form of register renaming to make the cache easy to implement. The <b>physical</b> register <b>file</b> in this configuration contains fewer entries than the logical register file and is designed so that the physical register fi [...] ...|$|R
