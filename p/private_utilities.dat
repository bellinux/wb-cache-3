25|$|There are no {{autonomous}} {{regulatory agencies}} {{for water and}} sanitation in Germany at the state or federal level. The recently created federal regulatory agency for network industries (Bundesnetzagentur) covers telecommunications, postal services, electricity, gas and rail. It does not cover water supply and sanitation, since it is a responsibility of the states. Water and sanitation tariffs are approved through different procedures in each state, usually by a department in the state Ministry of Economy after {{a review of the}} tariff increase request by an independent auditor. In city-states (Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen) this means that the Minister (called Senator) of Economy both requests the tariff increase in his capacity as {{chairman of the board of}} the utility and also approves it, which constitutes a conflict of interest. In the case of some <b>private</b> <b>utilities,</b> tariffs are set by a mutually agreed arbitrator based on the professional opinion of an auditor.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the design of}} multi-agent systems so as to optimize an overall world utility function when (1) those systems lack centralized communication and control, and (2) each agents runs a distinct Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. A crucial issue in such design problems is to initialize/update each agent's <b>private</b> <b>utility</b> function, so as to induce best possible world utility. Traditional 'team game' solutions to this problem sidestep this issue and simply assign to each agent the world <b>utility</b> as its <b>private</b> <b>utility</b> function. In previous work we used the 'Collective Intelligence' framework to derive a better choice of <b>private</b> <b>utility</b> functions, one that results in world utility performance up to orders of magnitude superior to that ensuing from use of the team game utility. In this paper we extend these results. We derive the general class of <b>private</b> <b>utility</b> functions that both are easy for the individual agents to learn and that, if learned well, result in high world utility. We demonstrate experimentally that using these new utility functions can result in significantly improved performance over that of our previously proposed utility, over and above that previous utility's superiority to the conventional team game utility...|$|R

This paper focuses on a method for improving a class of search algorithms using Intelligent RL based learning players engaging in a non-cooperative game.
