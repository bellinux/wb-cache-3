500|$|A {{perception}} {{in this context}} is any sensory experience, and the three broad types of perceptual disturbance are hallucinations, pseudohallucinations and illusions. A hallucination is defined as a sensory {{perception in}} the absence of any external stimulus, and is experienced in external or objective space (i.e. experienced by the subject as real). An illusion is defined as a false sensory perception in the presence of an external stimulus, in other words a distortion of a sensory experience, and may be recognized as such by the subject. A <b>pseudohallucination</b> is experienced in internal or subjective space (for example as [...] "voices in my head") and is regarded as akin to fantasy.|$|E
2500|$|A {{hallucination}} is {{a perception}} {{in the absence of}} external stimulus that has qualities of real perception. Hallucinations are vivid, substantial, and are perceived to be located in external objective space. They are distinguishable from these related phenomena: dreaming, which does not involve wakefulness; illusion, which involves distorted or misinterpreted real perception; imagery, which does not mimic real perception and is under voluntary control; and <b>pseudohallucination,</b> which does not mimic real perception, but is not under voluntary control. Hallucinations also differ from [...] "delusional perceptions", in which a correctly sensed and interpreted stimulus (i.e., a real perception) is given some additional (and typically absurd) significance.|$|E
50|$|A <b>pseudohallucination</b> is an {{involuntary}} sensory experience vivid {{enough to be}} regarded as a hallucination, but recognised by the patient not {{to be the result of}} external stimuli. Unlike normal hallucinations, which occurs when one sees, hears, smells, tastes or feels something that is not there, with a compelling feeling or thought that it is real, pseudohallucinations are recognised by the person as unreal.|$|E
5000|$|The term is {{not widely}} used in the {{psychiatric}} and medical fields, as it is considered ambiguous; the term nonpsychotic hallucination is preferred. <b>Pseudohallucinations,</b> then, {{are more likely to}} happen with a hallucinogenic drug. But [...] "the current understanding of <b>pseudohallucinations</b> is mostly {{based on the work of}} Karl Jaspers".|$|R
40|$|<b>Pseudohallucinations</b> have {{remained}} a contentious phenomenon in clinical psychopathology. Here following {{a review of}} the history and current conceptualisation on pesudohallucinations, they have been critically reviewed with regards to their deﬁning characteristics especially their quality, location and patient’s insight into them. It is argued that the insight and location criterion are not able to distinguish <b>pseudohallucinations</b> from hallucinations. The quality of the perception is a better guide in this distinction...|$|R
50|$|A further {{distinction}} is sometimes made between <b>pseudohallucinations</b> and parahallucinations, {{the latter being}} a result of damage to the peripheral nervous system.|$|R

50|$|Holographic {{models of}} memory and {{consciousness}} {{may be related to}} several brain disorders involving disunity of sensory input within a unified consciousness, including Charles Bonnet Syndrome, Disjunctive Agnosia, and Schizophrenia. Charles Bonnet Syndrome patients experience two vastly different worlds within one consciousness. They see the world that psychologically normal people perceive, but also a simplified world riddled with <b>Pseudohallucination.</b> These patients can differentiate these two worlds easily. Since dynamic core and global workspace theories insist that a distinct area of the brain is responsible for consciousness, the only way a patient would perceive two worlds was if this dynamic core and global workspace were split. But such does not explain how different content can be perceived within one single consciousness since these theories assume that each dynamic core or global workspace creates a single coherent reality. The primary symptom of Disjunctive Agnosia is an inconsistency of sensory information within a unified consciousness. They may see one thing, but hear something entirely incompatible with that image. Schizophrenics often report experiencing thoughts that do not seem to originate from themselves, as if the idea was inserted exogenously. The individual feels no control over certain thoughts existing within their consciousness.|$|E
50|$|They are {{considered}} a feature of conversion disorder, somatization disorder, and dissociative disorders. Also, <b>pseudohallucinations</b> can occur in people with visual/hearing loss, with the typical such type being Charles Bonnet syndrome.|$|R
5|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} {{are typical}} of psychoses: third-person hallucinations (i.e. voices talking about the patient) and hearing one's thoughts spoken aloud (gedankenlautwerden or écho de la pensée) are among the Schneiderian first rank symptoms indicative of schizophrenia, whereas second-person hallucinations (voices talking to the patient) threatening or insulting or telling them to commit suicide, may be a feature of psychotic depression or schizophrenia. Visual hallucinations are generally suggestive of organic conditions such as epilepsy, drug intoxication or drug withdrawal. Many of the visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs are more correctly described as visual illusions or visual <b>pseudohallucinations,</b> as they are distortions of sensory experiences, and are not experienced as existing in objective reality. Auditory <b>pseudohallucinations</b> are suggestive of dissociative disorders. Déjà vu, derealization and depersonalization are associated with temporal lobe epilepsy and dissociative disorders.|$|R
50|$|It {{also should}} be noted that the visuals do not {{constitute}} true hallucinations in the clinical sense of the word; people with HPPD recognize the visuals to be illusory, or <b>pseudohallucinations,</b> and thus maintain the ability to determine what is real (in contrast to some mental illnesses such as schizophrenia).|$|R

40|$|Prior to the 17 th century, the {{experiences}} we now name hallucinations or others alike were valued within a cultural context, they could bring {{meaning to the}} subject or the world. From mid- 17 th to 18 th centuries, they acquire a medical quality in mental and organic illnesses. However, the term was only fully integrated in psychiatry by Esquirol in the 18 th- 19 th centuries. By then, a controversy begins on whether hallucinations have a perceptual or intellectual origin. Esquirol favours the intellectual origin, describing them as an involuntary exercise of memory and imagination. By the twentieth century, some authors maintain that hallucinations are a form of delusion (Ey), while others describe them as a change in perception (Jaspers, Fish). A more integrated perspectives like those proposed by Alonso Fernandez and Luque, highlights the heterogeneity of hallucinations and the multiplicity of their types and causes. The terms <b>pseudohallucination,</b> illusion and hallucinosis are grafted into the concept of hallucination. Since its introduction the term <b>pseudohallucination</b> has been used with different meanings. The major characteristics that we found associated with pseudohallucinations were ‘lack of objectivity’ and ‘presence of insight’ (differing from hallucinations). Illusions are unanimously taken as distortions of real objects. Hallucinosis, first described {{in the context of}} alcohol consumption, is generally considered egodystonic, in which insight is preserved. These and other controversial aspects regarding the evolution of the term hallucination and all its derivative concepts are discussed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Visual <b>pseudohallucinations</b> are {{reported}} on {{in a patient}} with a left lower quadrantanopia due to a right parietotemporal surgical defect after tumour removal. Besides metamorphopsia, he hallucinated {{the lower half of}} human figures which were limited to within the borders of the anopic defect and appeared "amputated" at the hip with one forearm and hand appearing from above in correct anatomical position. The lower half of these human figures was perceived as correctly scaled in relation to anatomical and environmental coordinates and was recognised as unreal. These <b>pseudohallucinations</b> led to the concept of an "aperture effect" which alludes to the visibility through the anopic field defect of a segment of the contents of the visual association cortex. This supports the idea of a pictorial mode for representation of endogenously generated images in the visual association cortex. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the field}} of {{psychopathology}} he conducted studies of delusions, hallucinations and <b>pseudohallucinations,</b> providing a detailed nosology of these phenomena. He did extensive research of language {{and its relationship to}} mental illness. Here, he described linguistic traits such as logorrhea, embolalia, near-mutism, automatic speech, alexia, agraphia, et al.; and how these behaviors take shape and interact in various psychiatric disorders.|$|R
50|$|Hallucinations {{can occur}} {{in any of the}} five senses, {{although}} auditory and visual hallucinations are encountered more frequently than tactile (touch), olfactory (smell) or gustatory (taste) hallucinations.Auditory hallucinations are typical of psychoses: third-person hallucinations (i.e. voices talking about the patient) and hearing one's thoughts spoken aloud (gedankenlautwerden or écho de la pensée) are among the Schneiderian first rank symptoms indicative of schizophrenia, whereas second-person hallucinations (voices talking to the patient) threatening or insulting or telling them to commit suicide, may be a feature of psychotic depression or schizophrenia.

5000|$|Cannabis has psychoactive and {{physiological}} effects when consumed. The immediate desired effects from consuming cannabis include relaxation and euphoria (the [...] "high" [...] or [...] "stoned" [...] feeling), a general alteration of conscious perception, {{increased awareness of}} sensation, increased libido and distortions {{in the perception of}} time and space. At higher doses, effects can include altered body image, auditory and/or visual illusions, <b>pseudohallucinations</b> and ataxia from selective impairment of polysynaptic reflexes. In some cases, cannabis can lead to dissociative states such as depersonalization and derealization.|$|R
2500|$|Cannabis also {{produces}} many subjective and highly tangible effects, such as greater enjoyment of food taste and aroma, an enhanced enjoyment {{of music and}} comedy, and marked distortions {{in the perception of}} time and space (where experiencing a [...] "rush" [...] of ideas from the bank of long-term memory can create the subjective impression of long elapsed time, while in reality only a short time has passed).

50|$|Ganser {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} dissociative disorder previously classified as a factitious disorder. It is characterized by nonsensical or wrong answers to questions or doing things incorrectly, other dissociative symptoms such as fugue, amnesia or conversion disorder, often with visual <b>pseudohallucinations</b> and a decreased state of consciousness. It is also sometimes called nonsense syndrome, balderdash syndrome, syndrome of approximate answers, pseudodementia, hysterical pseudodementia or prison psychosis. This last name, prison psychosis, is sometimes used because the syndrome occurs most frequently in prison inmates, where it {{may be seen as}} an attempt to gain leniency from prison or court officials.|$|R
2500|$|Historically, and {{possibly}} {{related to the}} [...] "Reefer Madness" [...] legend, some people (particularly Americans) had confused cannabis with Jimson weed (Datura stramonium). Jimson weed, which grows wild in the United States and several other countries, is a potent deliriant which can cause true hallucinations and delusions that are believed by the user to be real, {{as opposed to the}} <b>pseudohallucinations</b> and perceptual distortions typically caused by cannabis. Confusion could have resulted from the fact that Daturas common name contains the word [...] "weed," [...] which is also a slang term for cannabis, and the fact that both plants (as well as others) have been given the moniker [...] "locoweed" [...] {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. [...] Aside from these superficial similarities, the two plants are not related and have very little to do with one another, and thus should not be confused. [...] Jimson weed is highly toxic and can cause delirium, confusion, hallucinations, blurred vision, photophobia, dry mouth, urinary retention, hyperthermia, incoordination, hypertension, and rapid heartbeat among other effects. [...] An overdose (or suspected overdose) on this substance is a medical emergency, as it can cause seizures, coma, or death by cardiac arrest.|$|R
40|$|Aim. The aim of {{this study}} is to discuss {{diagnostic}} and therapeutic challenges in a patient with a mutation in the gene responsible for the development of Huntington’s disease (HD) who presented schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. Method. A case report. Results. A 35 -year old man with genetically-confirmed HD who developed significant behavioural changes that occurred many years prior to the outbreak of choreic movements. There was a close temporal relationship between an onset of discrete involuntary movements and schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms (delusions of persecution, reference and bodily change, as well as auditory <b>pseudohallucinations</b> of threatening and commanding voices). At admission (subsequently to a suicidal attempt) he was ambivalent, ambitendent and – periodically – agitated. Pharmacotherapeutic regime of olanzapine (20 mg qd) and amisulpride (400 mg qd) led to a gradual improvement of the patient’s mental status. Conclusions. HD should always be included in the differential diagnosis of psychotic disorders. Patients with HD can exhibit various psychopathological symptoms (including psychotic ones) prior to the outbreak of movement symptoms. Both neurologists and psychiatrists should take part in the therapeutic process. Atypical antipsychotics seem to be effective in the discussed group of patients (although the evidence body consists mainly of scarce, low-quality data) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Astasia is the {{inability}} to maintain an upright body position without assistance {{in the absence of}} motor weakness or sensory loss. Abasia is described as {{the inability}} to walk or as uncoordinated walking, while preserving mobility of the lower limbs. Ganser syndrome is described as a dissociative disorder characterized by approximate answers, somatic conversion symptoms, clouding of consciousness, as well as visual and auditory <b>pseudohallucinations.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} present a case that seemed like a combination of neurological and internal disturbances, but actually represented a psychogenic disorder. Case Outline. This paper presents the case of a 13 -year-old patient with the first manifestation of {{the inability to}} walk and stand. Medical history, diagnostic instruments and differential diagnostic methods have been presented in detail. The clinical manifestation was initially interpreted as a neurological disorder. However, after the application of diagnostic procedures and a change in family circumstances, the patient was diagnosed with a psychogenic movement disorder, astasia-abasia, with progressive clinical presentation that included dissociative psychotic reactions (Ganser syndrome). Differential diagnosis as well as the elements of the therapeutic approach have been discussed. Conclusion. Presenting a case of psychogenic astasia-abasia in children contributes to a better understanding and differentiating between conditions with a clinical presentation of signs and symptoms dealt with by other branches of medicine...|$|R
